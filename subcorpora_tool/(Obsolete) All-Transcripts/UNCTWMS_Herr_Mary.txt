JW: This is Jessie Wilkerson and I&#8217;m in Cherokee, North Carolina, with Mary Herr and the date is May eighteenth-
MH: Nineteenth.
JW: Nineteenth, 2011. So Mary, could you start by saying where and when you were born?
MH: Okay. I was born in Springfield, Illinois, in 1940, and lived there with my parents until I was about two and a half or three and then my mother&#8217;s adopted father had passed away and left her the farm near Staunton, Illinois. So my mother did not really want to go, but my dad did. So we moved to the farm in 1943 and my sister was born that year. She was actually born, my mom went back to Springfield, where she was born. So we grew [up] on the farm.
JW: Can you tell me a little bit about your parents?
MH: Okay. Well, my dad&#8217;s the easy one. He was born in Springfield, Illinois. His father came to this country from, I think, Austria-Hungary. That&#8217;s the thing I&#8217;m still researching now, exactly where, but most things say either Austria or Hungary, and I understand at that time that it was one country and then it split. So his father came over to this country in 1892 and then his mother came in 1893, and then they got married in 1893 in Pennsylvania. And my dad&#8217;s two older brothers and sisters were born in Portage, Pennsylvania, where I was last week and then my dad was born in Springfield, Illinois. And I really don&#8217;t know a whole lot more about his family. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m still trying to find out.
My mother was born in East Bernstadt, Kentucky, in Laurel County, and her mother died when she was five from complications of childbirth. And then her father died two years later. He shot himself. So she had two older sisters and one younger brother, and, for one reason or another, none of the family could take them in or would take them in. So they were all split up and my mother was sent to Staunton, Illinois, with the family there. She stayed with them awhile, but they wanted somebody older and bigger and stronger. So they sent her out to the farm to Fred and Lizzie Bankherdt. She grew up on the farm where I grew up actually. They didn&#8217;t officially adopt her until she was about fifteen. But anyway, so she went to a small country school like I did, my sister and I did the first five years of my life and then we went to Catholic school in Staunton.   My mother kept in touch with her sisters, her older sister, Aunt Lula, even came up to visit when she was still young, and Aunt Leddie came up later when I was a child. My mom never had much contact with [Uncle John] and then in 1974, I got all of them together, the four siblings that had not been all together since they were very small children. So that was kind of neat.  JW: So was it something that your mom talked about openly? Did she talk about being abandoned basically and being moved to this other place that wasn&#8217;t familiar to her?  MH: You know, she really didn&#8217;t talk about that much. She always talked about the Bankherdts that raised her, that they went for months without talking to each other and were not loving at all. I think I said it in the book that my mom must have had some really good nurturing in her early years with her mom and dad to have come out as well-rounded as she did with the upbringing she had with those folks. But anyway, she didn&#8217;t talk a lot about it. She remembered that the house they lived in in Kentucky had a floor. It was not a wooden floor; it was a dirt floor. I remember her talking about that they would get teaberry leaves and eat the teaberry leaves. Again, she was like seven when she went to Illinois.   She never knew exactly what happened to her father other than he had been shot. There were different legends as to what had happened, but when I got into doing this family genealogy stuff, I searched for weeks through old newspapers and I finally found a little notice that he had shot himself. One of the things that it said in it was something to the effect that he had many problems, some of which were known only to him.   JW: Wow, that&#8217;s a heavy sentence.  MH: Right, yeah, but that was in the death notice. But yeah, I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve looked at old obituaries, but some of them are quite interesting. And the other thing I have learned--. On my mother&#8217;s side of the family there have been five suicides by gunshot wounds, including my sister&#8217;s son at age twenty-eight. So yeah, it&#8217;s all been males, but it&#8217;s interesting. It&#8217;s good to know. I knew my Uncle John shot himself. He was in his 60s and he had Parkinson&#8217;s and he had stomach problems and different things; so he shot himself. And then my grandfather&#8217;s youngest brother, who lived in Jellico, Tennessee, he shot himself when he was in his 70s. And then my grandfather, Tim, Uncle John, oh yeah, and then my maternal grandmother was a Routledge and it would have been her half-brother, I found, shot himself and he was fairly young, in his 30s or 40s, something like that.  JW: How has your family dealt with that?  MH: Well, we never knew that until, I mean, I just found this out in recent years. My mom&#8217;s been dead since &#8217;96. So she doesn&#8217;t know any of that. My sister knows about it, and I think she found it--. Because Tim was twenty-eight when he shot himself and seemingly doing everything he was supposed to be doing. He had made one attempt just by aspirin and stuff and then he was in counseling. He was seeing a mental health therapist. He was seeing a minister. He was on medication. He was doing, seemingly, and he said after that first attempt, he told me, he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll never do that again.&#8221; But I don&#8217;t know. I guess the depression just took over and that was it. But again, it&#8217;s good for us to know and he has a son, Scott, who is sixteen now, who will be seventeen in July, and he&#8217;s a lot like his dad in some ways. So it&#8217;s something that we have to be aware of because that&#8217;s a lot.   JW: Can you tell me a little bit more about what it was like growing up on the farm?  MH: Okay. Well, I think again, I don&#8217;t remember being in Springfield when we were in the city. So that&#8217;s all I remember is pretty much growing up on the farm. We didn&#8217;t have much, but nobody else did either. We had chickens and we killed cows and pigs to eat and always had a big garden. We had to walk [to school] the first five grades. We went to the Butler School, which is where my mother had gone, and it was about two miles. So we had to walk to school every day, and I liked school. I was the only student in my class all five grades. (laughs)  JW: That&#8217;s amazing.  MH: Yeah. They had all eight grades there. Most of them had at least two or three and some even had four, but I was the only one all five grades that I was the only one in my class. But I liked school and I was good. I learned easily and I would get my work done and then sometimes I would help the kids because my sister was in kindergarten. She started kindergarten. They didn&#8217;t have kindergarten when I went. And then I would also listen to the higher grades, what they were talking about. So it was interesting and I think I&#8217;ve said many times that Mrs. Leverins, who was our teacher, I just really admire her for being able to teach all eight grades in one room, but she was amazing. I feel like I got a really good education.  JW: How did she do that? How did she juggle all eight grades?  MH: She would start with the lower grades and kind of get them doing some things and then she would go up, and while she was doing the lower grades, the higher grades would be reading or writing or doing papers or whatever they needed to do. But yeah, she had it down.  JW: It&#8217;s a different sort of teaching skill.  MH: Oh I know, oh for sure. As I think back, how in the world did she do that? But we all got a good education. And we had chores after school. We would sometimes have to gather the eggs and then also another thing, we had picked up corn cobs that we burned. I helped with the milking quite a bit, and in the garden in summertime and that. So there were always things to do. And we didn&#8217;t have electricity until I was nine, so you went to bed early in the wintertime. (laughs) I&#8217;m thankful for that experience because I said we&#8217;ve all gotten so spoiled now with everything being electric and everything that if I had, I would prefer not having to go back, but if I had to go back to living like that, I could because I&#8217;ve been there and I&#8217;ve done it.   Overall, my parents were pretty strict with us and with me especially, I always thought, because my sister was three years younger and I think she got babied a little more than I did. But they did the best they could for what they had. I don&#8217;t know if I turned out to be as independent as I am because of how I grew up or if it just is my personality or what. I think it might be part of the genes from my mother&#8217;s side of the family, though, because she was pretty strong and for all that she had to endure. And then my Aunt Lula, her older sister, she was driving a car in the late 1900s, like 1919, 1920, those years. Women didn&#8217;t do that back then. And she would make the trip up to Illinois to see my mother. So I think she was pretty independent, too.   JW: What was your parents&#8217; relationship like?  MH: It was stormy at times, I guess, and of course, my mother, it was that generation, I guess, that the woman just did everything the man said, whether she agreed with it or not. I guess it was a pretty typical marriage of those times. The man was the head of the household. My mother never learned to drive. My dad would let her drive the tractor occasionally, but never let her drive the car.  JW: Did she want to drive the car?  MH: I think she did at one point, but it was such an issue with him that she just said it wasn&#8217;t worth it. But yeah, they had their arguments and stuff, but basically, as long as we kept my dad happy. But I know my mother was very frustrated a lot of times with things.   JW: Did she ever talk about being frustrated or teach her girls, her daughters to do or be something different than what she had been able to do?  MH: No. They both emphasized getting an education was the thing I remember more than anything because my mom went through the eighth grade, my dad went through the seventh grade, and he went to work in the coal mines when he was twelve. And then my mom, she was like fifteen when she graduated from the eighth grade, but that was because she didn&#8217;t start until she was about nine in the first grade because evidently, they didn&#8217;t go to school when they were in Kentucky. But no, not really, no. They were just emphasizing to get an education.  JW: So how did they choose a school for you when you left to go to high school? Or you started a Catholic school at that time?  MH: A Catholic school. Well, it was the only one where the bus would run because we had to ride the bus. It was about seven miles. And my mom was not Catholic originally, and she had agreed when she married my dad to bring the kids up Catholic. So she honored that and so she wanted us to go because it was either Catholic school or public school in Staunton. It was really her that insisted that we go to Catholic school and it was the only one, and it was the closest one. So they didn&#8217;t have really much choice other than going to the Catholic or public school, and then the same with high school. It was the only one in the area, Staunton High School.  JW: Can you describe high school?  MH: Well, let&#8217;s see. Again, I was a good student and I took all the business courses. Back then, they called it bookkeeping and typing and all those things, because I had decided I wanted to be a secretary because again, back then, the choices, at least as what I understood, you pretty much either got married and stayed on the farm, became a nurse, a teacher, or a secretary. Those were kind of the choices. So I definitely did not want to stay on the farm and be a farmer&#8217;s wife. Nursing did not appeal to me. I guess I thought I wasn&#8217;t qualified to be a teacher. So secretary just kind of seemed to be--. There were more jobs for that. Again, we had to ride the bus there and back, so did not take part in any things after school hours. I think I was on the yearbook staff and I was a librarian, things that I could do during the day, but other than that, I just--.   Never dated during high school. My mother always said I had to be sixteen before I could date and by the time I was sixteen, I was not interested in anybody. I was a country music fan. So my heroes were country music stars, and I would listen to the Grand Ole Opry and the country music stations and that. So those were kind of my heroes growing up.   I got into, because I always liked writing and I remember one of the projects we had to do for school, I guess it was English lit or something, to select some favorite poems and then also to write some things. So I got into that and then I got into writing some country music songs, not the music, because I didn&#8217;t know anything about music, but I wrote some songs. They never went anywhere, but I guess it was good therapy for me.   But I think, yeah, my graduation day was probably one of the happiest days of my life because I had a job lined up in St. Louis. I had gone down for an interview and had a job lined up. I was ready to leave home. I was ready to be on my own. So that was good, and I took the bus. Mom and dad and Maggie took me to the bus station, put me on the bus with this big blue suitcase that I had gotten for graduation with most of my worldly belongings, and then I stayed at the Evangeline Residence, which was, I don&#8217;t know--. Well, you&#8217;re probably not familiar with St. Louis, but it was close to downtown St. Louis, and the job that I had was with Aetna Casualty Insurance Company. I was what they called an &#8220;ediphone operator.&#8221; I would listen, transcribe from the disc. And that was downtown. The Evangeline Residence was about twenty blocks from downtown. So I would take the bus in every day and back home. And shared a room with Sue, I blanked out on her name again, Sue Burk, yeah, who was from Missouri up around Jefferson City, and that was a pretty good experience living there. But I would go home, I guess, every other weekend to start with and then about once a month afterward.   But my goal was to get to Nashville, Tennessee. And my mother said, &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to stay in St. Louis.&#8221; So I said, &#8220;Well, I will for awhile.&#8221; But then Aetna that I worked for, they had a branch office in Nashville. So I checked in to see whether I could transfer to the office in Nashville, and I could. So after I lived in St. Louis for about a year and a half, I guess, then I moved to Nashville and then I didn&#8217;t go home, oh, probably Christmas and Easter and maybe holidays until I got a car. And then after I got a car, I still didn&#8217;t go up real often because it was a good drive. Anyway, so that was then my life in Nashville.  JW: Well, can I ask you a few questions about going to St. Louis?  MH: Uh huh.  JW: First, what year did you graduate high school?  MH: &#8217;58, 1958.   JW: Okay, and you were how old?  MH: I was seventeen, going on eighteen. I was eighteen in September, but I graduated in May.  JW: So do you remember getting to St. Louis on your own for the first time? Do you remember what that was like or any stories from those first days in trying to get settled?  MH: You know, I was talking to one of my high school classmates about this. I don&#8217;t remember. I remember going there to a, what do you call it, personnel agency where they find you jobs, but I don&#8217;t remember if anybody went with me or not. I think one of the friends of the family that they all went to Butler School and then they went to Staunton Catholic School, too, and Ruth Sherf was her name, and she was a year older than me. So she had graduated a year before me and she had gone to St. Louis to work. She was staying at the Evangeline Residence. So I think maybe it was through her that I found out how to get there or something.   But I don&#8217;t remember because one of my classmates, we got together last year or so and she thought I went with her to take the civil service exam, but I swear I don&#8217;t remember that. (laughs) Because she took the civil service exam and then she went to work for the Air Force base there in Belleville, Illinois. See, some of that stuff I just don&#8217;t remember and when I was writing the book, those early years, if my sister had not helped me remember some of those things, I don&#8217;t know if I just blocked it out or what. But I can remember taking the bus to St. Louis and knowing where to get off. Well, I got off at the Greyhound bus terminal and then somehow I knew how to get the bus out to the Evangeline Residence, but I don&#8217;t know unless it was through Ruth.  JW: Do you remember going to work for the first time at the office?  MH: I do, I do remember that. Those were the days and first impressions, they always said, were very important. Of course, I had gone for an interview before and when I went for the interview, I wore a little hat, white gloves, all dressed up in my heels and everything. So that was for the interview, but then also I noticed some people were dressed that way. So I dressed that way when I went to work at first. My supervisor, her name was Vivian, was very nice. She kind of showed me around, where my desk was going to be, and introduced me to folks and then she took me to lunch at Famous-Barr, which was a big, fancy to me, department store with a big nice restaurant. So she took me to lunch there and that was quite an experience. So I remember that.   At least one of the people that I worked with there, we kept in touch. Her name was Margaret Burns and she was in the same department as I was. And we kept in touch until, oh, I guess about five or six years ago. She had Alzheimer&#8217;s, so she kind of lost it and then she just died last year. But she was, what, ninety-four, I think, when she died. So she was a few years older than me, but she came down to visit me when I was living here one time. But most of the other folks that I worked with there I didn&#8217;t keep in touch with.   JW: What was the environment of the work place?  MH: We were, I guess, called the &#8220;steno pool.&#8221; We would get a fifteen-minute break in the morning and afternoon, and they had a break room. Usually, if I remember right, we would go by departments so not everybody was there at the same time. And other than Marge Burns, I didn&#8217;t really develop-well, there was Joanie Johnson. She lived at the Evangeline Residence too, and she kind of took me under her wing for awhile and kind of showed me around, too. But yeah, it was hard work, but I enjoyed it. I was a good typist. I got a lot of work done.   JW: Can you say more about the Evangeline Residence, what it was and how these women got there?  MH: Okay, yeah. It was fifteen stories high and coming from the farm, that was a big floor and I was on the fifteenth floor. (laughs) So yeah, it was operated by the Salvation Army primarily for working women and many of them went home on weekends, some not every weekend. We were provided breakfast and dinner and then we ate lunch out. You just shared, well, if you&#8217;ve been to nursing homes recently, you share, two beds and little stuff like. It was not much bigger than most of those, but we weren&#8217;t there. We were both at work during the day and then we came home. And Sue, my roommate, she didn&#8217;t do much, didn&#8217;t date a whole lot either. I don&#8217;t know what we did in the evenings, but didn&#8217;t go out a whole lot; I know that. But it was a safe place, secure place. Again, it was all women. It was good. Now my sister did the same thing for the first year that she went to St. Louis, but she moved out into an apartment after that, and I probably would have if I had not moved to Nashville. And the food was pretty good. You pretty much knew every other Sunday what you were going to have. (laughs) They had kind of their set menus, but it was pretty good.  JW: It sounds like a fascinating place with all single, young, working women, almost like a college dorm.  MH: Right, yeah.  JW: But they&#8217;re going to work.  MH: Right, yeah.  JW: Did it have any sort of programming or activities or activity boards?  MH: No, no, not that I remember.  JW: Did it have rules or curfews?  MH: Oh yeah, yeah, you had to be in by, I think, ten o&#8217;clock, yeah, something like that. And we each had our own little mailbox. It&#8217;s kind of like a college dorm. But yeah, some of the women there were up in the 40s and 50s, not just all real young either. It was interesting. I met some interesting people there. I remember once, she was across the hall from me. Her name was Cel, Cecelia, but they called her Cel, and she was from Texas, and then there was another that was down from her. She was also from Texas and her name was Daisy Ray. (laughs) I always remember saying, &#8220;Daisy Ray!&#8221; (laughs)  JW: That&#8217;s a great name.  MH: Anyway, so yeah, it was a good experience.   JW: And how did you make your way to Nashville?  MH: I took the bus and again all of my worldly belongings. Or wait a minute. Was I driving? No, I wasn&#8217;t driving then. I didn&#8217;t have a car until I was in Nashville. Yeah, I took the bus. Again, I had kind of done the job interview over the phone. They had offered me a job. So I knew I was going to have a job. So I found a room that was fairly close to downtown that I stayed in for awhile, but it was just like you had to share a bath and everything. I think I stayed there a month or so while I looked for an apartment and then I found, it was a furnished apartment. It was actually the upstairs of a house. It was a lady who was probably in her 50s, I guess, at that time, and her mother who was in a wheelchair, who was like in her 70s or 80s. So they lived downstairs and then they had made three upstairs apartments. So I had one and Eloise had another one and Ivory had another one. So we all [had] our own little space and it had a kitchen and everything. So I did my own cooking and everything and then just rode the bus to work.   I was talking to my friend, Jenny, when I was up in Philadelphia. She lives in an apartment. She and her husband are in an apartment now. They&#8217;re so thankful that they have a washer and dryer in the apartment and I said, &#8220;Yeah, I remember the days when I used to have to take the bus to go to the laundromat, get my little basket and stuff and walk down to the bus stop and get on the bus and go there and sit and wait while it washes and dries.&#8221; (laughs) So it was really nice when I got a car. But I guess [I] was in Nashville a couple years before I got a car. One of my friends that I had met there, she taught me how to drive. So I got my license and got a car. It was a &#8217;54 Ford, blue and white. I don&#8217;t remember driving-oh yeah, because then the Aetna office moved from way downtown out to the West End, which was not too far from where I lived and they had a parking lot. So then I would drive to work.  JW: Can you describe being a young woman in Nashville? You were this country music fan.  MH: Right.  JW: Can you describe what it was like to be there?  MH: Right. Back then, you could go to the Grand Ole Opry for fifty cents. (laughs) And then Friday, they had the Friday night opry, they called it, or Friday night frolic. That was free. That was held at the studios at WSM where they broadcasted. So I went and met some, I was a big fan of the Wilburn Brothers and met some of their fan club members and got to be friends with them. So we would go many times every Friday and Saturday night to the Friday night opry and to the Grand Ole Opry and got to meet a lot of the stars.   There was a restaurant called (33:00) which was kind of across from the Opry and for those that didn&#8217;t drink, they would gather there. For those, the drinkers would go to Tootsie&#8217;s Orchid Lounge. And then sometimes you could meet the stars-oh, there&#8217;s Edwardo-back in the alley between the Opry and Tootsie&#8217;s. And then back then, you didn&#8217;t have to worry about security and all this stuff. You could just go up and talk to any of them, like Marty Robbins and Johnny Cash and the Wilburn Brothers and Ray Price and all these guys.   And then not every Saturday night, but quite a few Saturday nights, Ernest Tubb, who was a famous country music star, he had a record shop and they would have the midnight jamboree at midnight, which was right after the Opry. So we would quite often go there and stay for that. It was an hour. So you got a chance to get to meet all the stars that would come there for that. It was neat.   Well, at the beginning, I didn&#8217;t have a car, but then after I had a car, Ima Jean and Reba were the friends that I went with a lot to all those things. They did not have a car. So I would pick them up and drive them. And then we also did all-night bowling sometimes because the Wilburn Brothers were into bowling, all-night bowling. So it was out not too far beyond from where I lived, and we would get there about eleven o&#8217;clock and you could bowl all night for like three or four dollars, something like that. (laughs) This was in the &#8217;60s, so things were a lot less expensive. So we would go there and we would bowl until like two or three o&#8217;clock in the morning and then go home and sleep most of the day. That was usually on Friday night we would do that, yeah, and then Saturday night we would go to the Opry and then to the midnight jamboree and then go home.  JW: And were you a member of fan clubs?  MH: Yeah, of the Wilburn Brothers, right.  JW: And what did people do in the fan clubs?  MH: Well, basically I was more active in it when I was still on the farm before I got to Nashville, but you just kind of wrote letters to different stations asking them to promote, play the Wilburn Brothers records and stuff like that, and try to go to different places where they made appearances and things.  JW: So were they often there bowling when you were there?  MH: Uh huh, right, right.  JW: You did get to know them?  MH: Yeah, right.  JW: Yeah, it is really different from today because you don&#8217;t-  MH: Oh, I know.  JW: People are very shielded.  MH: Yeah, right. Well, see, and you didn&#8217;t have to do that back then. Yeah, I&#8217;ve got several pictures. I think I&#8217;ve got one of them in the book. Did I put one in there-  JW: I think so, yes.  MH: With the Wilburn Brothers. But yeah, I got to know them fairly well.   JW: So you were working still at the insurance company throughout your time in Nashville and it&#8217;s in the &#8217;60s. So what were the gender relations like in the office? What were the men doing?  MH: Yeah, okay. Well, again, of course, all the department heads were male. The boss, the general manager, was male. Most of the clerical staff were all women. When I went to Nashville, I first just was again secretarial and that, but I also did some of the work for the general manager and then when they moved out to West End and expanded the office and everything, I was promoted to general manager&#8217;s secretary. I worked for him and for one other guy. But because I was the general manager&#8217;s secretary, all the department heads kind of had to go through me and report to me for different things and that. So I developed some real good friendships with a lot of those guys, and then one of the field representatives was a young guy, Bill Glenn, that I got a crush on. They would get together like Friday after work. There was a place called Shakey&#8217;s, I think it was, or something. It was a pizza place, a beer and pizza place. So we would all go there for beer and pizza after work. Then some of the things that I remember that we had a couple times, pig roasts, and we did one in my backyard and that was quite an experience. But that was mostly with the guys that I worked with and their wives. They would come to the pig roasts and things like that.   Again, I never dated a whole lot. I dated a few guys, but I just never--. And Bill and I were friends, and I would have dated him more and he traveled a lot. That was part of his job, too. And then I started taking some night courses, and then I did babysitting, too, to earn some extra money so I could buy my own furniture. Then I got an unfurnished apartment and went from there. Again, it was a good experience. I&#8217;ve kept in touch with, well, most of them are dead now that I worked with, but kept in touch with most of them throughout the years and visited some of them. Some of them stayed in Nashville. Paul O&#8217;Keefe was one of them. They moved to California, (39:40), so I visited them some. I remember when they got the first computers with the, I&#8217;ve forgotten what you call them now. You know the cards that have the little holes punched in them? They don&#8217;t even use them anymore. (laughs)  JW: Yeah, I don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re called. Floppy disks?  MH: No, way before that. They&#8217;re like little cards, but the computer would punch little holes in it and the computer would read it. But anyway, these computers were like bigger than the refrigerator and there was a whole section of the office that were these computers. So yeah, we&#8217;ve come a long way, kids. (laughs)  JW: Did you have to learn how to work those?  MH: I did not do the computer part. No, I stayed with the typewriter. But one of the things that I did do was the teletype. Have you ever heard of a teletype? It had a keyboard like a typewriter, but it was a big machine and it had paper in it on a roll and then you would type on it and then it would print it out. But it would also send it somewhere else, sort of like a telegraph, I guess. So that was one of my other jobs. I was the teletype operator. You would send messages. The home office was in Hartford, Connecticut. So you would send messages to them and then they&#8217;d send messages. So that was kind of neat. Yeah, this is old stuff. (laughs)   JW: So as the general manager, were you over the other secretaries too? Were you managing the other women?  MH: Not really, no, because each department, like there was an accounting department and there was a personal lines department, there was a commercial lines department, there was a bond department, so each one of those departments had a supervisor. The department heads were all men, but then there was a supervisor under them, and some of the supervisors were women. But no, I, pretty much, I was the secretary to the general manager and the agency department manager. So I did work for him and for the field representatives. I guess I was kind of, being the general manager&#8217;s secretary, though, I was kind of the unofficial overseer of the women, but not officially because each department had their own.  JW: So would women come to you with complaints and things like that?  MH: Yeah, yeah, quite often, and then I would usually go to their department head first and talk to him and then if it still didn&#8217;t work, then I would go to the general manager. He sometimes would do something, sometimes he wouldn&#8217;t.  JW: Do you recall what kinds of complaints would have been kind of the norm or what people would be unhappy about?  MH: Oh gosh. Oh, I know the other thing I had to do that I really didn&#8217;t like. I had to keep attendance and tardy records on everybody. (laughs) That was one of the things. They didn&#8217;t like that someone was keeping those records, but yeah, it was for a long time we had to do that, and then I think they finally decided not to do that. But again, it was an all-white office, no blacks, no nothing, until--. Because of the affirmative action program they finally hired a black man to work in the mailroom, and he was a good old soul. It was obviously, I think, probably the one time he&#8217;d ever worked in an all-white office.   Then the other thing I remember about working because we were right next to Morrison&#8217;s Cafeteria where we went to lunch quite a bit, and I remember when they were trying to integrate that. They had lines out front and people out front. It was interesting times because Nashville was pretty segregated at that time, where St. Louis was not as obviously segregated, although it was too, but not as much as Nashville. Yeah, one of the guys that worked, he was in the claims department. His name was, I&#8217;ll never forget because I typed his name all the time, Samuel J. Galloway, and he looked like Clark Gable in Gone with the Wind, southern gentleman with his hat and his bowtie and black suit. I was fascinating to him because he&#8217;d never met anybody from up north. And then when he found out I was Catholic, he&#8217;d never met a Catholic before. So he started quizzing me about all this Catholic stuff and finally he said, well, you know, he said, &#8220;I would never have guessed that you were a Yankee Catholic because you&#8217;re so nice.&#8221; (laughs) I took that as a compliment.  JW: Yeah, so I guess what was it like to be a young woman in a southern city where there was a certain persona that some southern women had that would be different, maybe, from your background growing up on the farm?  MH: Yeah. It was certainly a different culture from what I--. Because see, I never knew any black people growing up because Staunton was one of those towns, there were no black people there. I think the first one I ever saw was Edwardsville, which was a town that we went to a couple times a year to get baby chickens and stuff. The first black person I ever saw, he was in uniform, army uniform. And then when I was in St. Louis, there were a few that I worked with, but not many and there were not many at the Evangeline Residence other than the kitchen help. Having never known, grown up being taught to be prejudiced, I just wasn&#8217;t. But yeah, it was very interesting to me the attitudes of some of the southerners towards the black people.   JW: Do you remember any stories or moments when you questioned how people were acting?  MH: I guess I was probably not brave enough at that time to speak up and say.  JW: Or even internally questioning?  MH: Oh yeah, yeah. I just didn&#8217;t understand why they treated black people that way. I mean, why couldn&#8217;t they go in the restaurant like everybody else? That just didn&#8217;t make sense to me. But yeah, when I first went to Nashville, they still had the colored only restrooms and everything. I just never understood that. It just didn&#8217;t make sense to me. They are people, too. But yeah, I wasn&#8217;t brave enough back then to speak up too much.  JW: So in 1967, you picked up and moved to Phoenix. Can you explain how you made that decision?  MH: Okay. Well, I thought I was in love with Bill Glenn and that was not going anywhere. I mean, we were friends and we did things as a group. I was kind of ready to make a move, and I had always wanted to live in the Southwest. I had read a lot about the Southwest and I had read an article somewhere that Phoenix had some of the most eligible bachelors. (laughs) So I thought, &#8220;I&#8217;ll go to Phoenix.&#8221; So I researched that, and that one I did not have a job. I didn&#8217;t know what I was going to do. Anyway, so I thought absence makes the heart grow fonder. If I go to Phoenix, maybe Bill will decide there was something there. But he didn&#8217;t; it didn&#8217;t happen.   And when I mentioned it to one of the women that worked in Aetna Life, it was a different building, but she was the teletype operator there and we would talk sometimes, so when she found out I was going to Phoenix, she said, &#8220;Oh I&#8217;ve always wanted to go to Phoenix.&#8221; And she was married at the time, but in a very unhappy and unhealthy relationship. So she decided she would go with me to Phoenix.   So yeah, the plan was to go in like late March, early April, but also I had agreed to stay on as the secretary until they could find a replacement and I could train her. So in March, I went ahead and stored my furniture because I knew I wasn&#8217;t going to take that with me to Phoenix and then stayed with a friend, Betty Carle, she was at that time. But they didn&#8217;t get anybody hired until June. So it was July before we took off for Phoenix. Well, Phoenix in July is--. Because the car I had before did not have an air conditioner and I knew I was going to have to have an air conditioner in Phoenix, so I got this, I don&#8217;t remember the year now, but it was a big black Oldsmobile; it had a built-in air conditioner. But that thing, when you turned on the air conditioner, it drank the gas. It just went (makes drinking noise). But anyway, so we loaded up everything that we could, and, of course, it had a huge trunk and back seat.   So we loaded up everything we thought we needed in my car and took off for Phoenix and made several stops. I remember we stopped in Houston because one of the guys that I used to work with in Nashville had been transferred out there, so stopped to visit with him. He was a party boy. So we met some people at his apartment and like always, he had a party going on. But then continued on. I know we stopped in San Antonio, spent a day there, and eventually got to Phoenix. I can&#8217;t remember now how we found the apartment. I think we stayed at a motel for awhile or just a room kind of thing and then got a two-bedroom apartment in Phoenix. That was good except Linda, the girl, she turned out to be a lot more raunchy than I was and she started bringing guys home at night. I said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t deal with this.&#8221; So I asked if I could move to a one-bedroom apartment. So I did that.  JW: Were there eligible bachelors there? Was the article--?  MH: Yeah. Well, one of the things the article said was that the place to meet, and remember this Phoenix and it&#8217;s Arizona, was the Young Republican Club. At that time, I was kind of ambivalent as to Democrat, Republican, whatever. So we went, Linda and I went to some of those things and met some people there. Then through the church, I met some folks and started dating this one guy, Woody. He was, I guess, in his early 30s and I was, let&#8217;s see, at that time, I was twenty-seven. He was thirty-five, I think he was, and nice guy. He still lived with his mother. He was Irish Catholic and we dated quite a while, but then I decided, this guy wants another mother. I wasn&#8217;t in for that. And then I dated another guy, I don&#8217;t even remember his name, for a while, but that just wasn&#8217;t for me either.   And then what I did was when I went to Phoenix, I worked for Kelly Girl, temporary jobs. Then one of the places they sent me was the Arizona state Senate. So they kept me on and I stayed there for the time. But then I was kind of getting restless again and decided I wanted to do something for humanity. So that&#8217;s when I joined VISTA and I had put on my application that I wanted to work either with Native Americans or in Appalachia. Anyway, so they sent me to Baltimore, Maryland, for the training first of all. That was two of the longest weeks I ever lived in my life.  JW: Well, I want to ask you more about that. Can we jump back a little bit?  MH: Okay.  JW: So you moved to Phoenix partially, one of the reasons being to meet a potential partner. So can you say a little bit more about why that seemed like an important thing to do? Were you thinking about marriage at the time? Were you thinking that was something that you wanted?  MH: Yeah, I guess I thought it wasn&#8217;t high on my list of priorities, but I know it&#8217;s what my mother wanted me to do. She was worried about me running around the country and all this stuff. And back then, pretty much most people got married in their 20s. That&#8217;s how it was. As I said, it wasn&#8217;t high on my list of priorities, but I thought, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll go there and try that and see what happens.&#8221; Then I just decided, Woody, the guy that I was dating, I just decided that he&#8217;s not the one for me and then that&#8217;s when I decided to go into VISTA. And again, I&#8217;ve always had male friends, but I never really got heavily involved with anybody because it seemed there were always things that were more interesting to me, I guess. I think I took after my Aunt Lula in that regard, although she was married twice.   JW: And was your sister married by that point?  MH: Yes. Let&#8217;s see, my sister got married in 1965. Yeah, and that was another happy day in my life because, again, I always felt kind of responsible for her. I was three years older than her. And Jerry, the first guy she married, I liked him. He was kind of like a brother, a brother I never had. After she got married, I just kind of felt, &#8220;Whew.&#8221; I think, yeah, because she was married by the time I went to Phoenix, so that kind of freed me up to do that too. And then the VISTA experience, are you ready to go to that?  JW: Yes.  MH: Okay. That again, the two weeks of training in Baltimore, we were in an old convent, no air conditioning. It was three floors. It was July in Baltimore, which is very hot and humid and of course, we had virtually no money and we were given a limited amount of money and we had to live on that because they wanted us to experience being poor for those of us who hadn&#8217;t been poor before. (laughs) And some of these kids had not been. They were from pretty wealthy families and this was, again, in the &#8217;60s. So a lot of guys were there as an alternative to Vietnam and doing their alternative service. Interesting group we had, it was interesting.   Yeah, a couple of the guys that I got to know real well, one was Rafe, and I can&#8217;t remember his last name, but he was a Jewish guy from New York City, and then Lenny, who was a black guy from New Orleans. I&#8217;ll never forget, one time we had to go somewhere and because I had a car and they didn&#8217;t, so the three of us were going in my car. I guess, yeah, we were going to an in-service training in Newport News, Virginia, because we were based in Virginia. So here&#8217;s Lenny, the black guy, Rafe, the Jewish guy, and myself going through this KKK country. (laughs) I had to stop and get gas and Lenny said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not getting out.&#8221; I mean, the looks that I got, you would not believe. It was something else. But we made it without any cross burnings or anything. But that was an interesting experience.  JW: Can you talk a little bit about the kind of training that they were doing in VISTA, besides forcing you to be poor?  MH: Right. Actually, the training was very good. There was kind of two aspects. One was the community organizing aspect based on Saul Alinsky&#8217;s trainings, which was totally foreign to me. I had never heard of any of those concepts. But I am very grateful for it because everything that I have done since then, it sure came in handy with community organizing and working with community groups. That was a part of it, and then what they call T Groups, which was like sensitive training. Are you familiar with that?  JW: No.  MH: I guess &#8220;T&#8221; was for therapy, but it was a process to see how people were going to handle different situations because for most of these folks, it was a totally different culture. For me, it was somewhat, but having lived in Nashville, Virginia wasn&#8217;t that different. But for some of them, it was total cultural shock coming to the South because a lot of them were from the Northeast, big cities. So it was trying to get us to be sensitive to the local culture, which again, was helpful in some ways, but I think they-again, and I was older. I was twenty-eight, I guess, at that time, twenty-seven or twenty-eight. Most of them were like nineteen, twenty, and twenty-one and pretty immature in many ways. So I felt like some of the stuff they were putting us through was a little uncalled for, but I guess there was a reason for it because I remember some of the kids, I call them kids, were literally crying. They just felt like it was--.  JW: So what kind of stuff was it?  MH: See, that&#8217;s something I probably blocked out. (laughs) It was real intense. I remember that and I remember the guy that was one of the trainers. Wally Pond was his name, and he was about my age. He wasn&#8217;t much older than I was. He made a lot of people very uncomfortable and very unhappy and they weeded out some of the folks. I guess it had a purpose. It was some kind of psychological testing, I guess.  JW: So was it kind of like role playing, getting people to do stuff like that?  MH: Some role playing, yeah. We did the group sessions and I think there were twelve or fourteen of us, something like that. See, I kept notes on all that stuff for a long time and then when I was moving one time, I threw away all that stuff and I should have kept it. (laughs) I kept some stuff, but not all of it. I remember after the VISTA experience, I wrote about everybody that was in the group, but anyway, I didn&#8217;t keep that. I should have because then I could answer your questions.   JW: Well, I know in the Atlanta trainings, they had people like Eula Hall go and she trained. Did you have that experience where there were local people coming in to help train?  MH: Some local people, yeah, some with the CAP agency, the Community Action Program. But those guys, one of them, as we found out, our supervisor was a KKK member.  JW: Can you tell that story and how you found out that he was?  MH: Yeah. Let me go to the bathroom.   JW: Yes.  (break in conversation)
JW: Okay, so you were going to tell me about learning about the Klan member who was in VISTA.
MH: Oh right. He was our VISTA supervisor for Bedford County, Virginia, through the Community Action Program. One of the guys somehow found out. I don&#8217;t know. One of the VISTA guys somehow found out and one of the reasons, because Joanie, who was working with me at that time, we were assigned to work in this black community in Bedford County and we&#8217;re starting to make some progress getting to know some folks. Well, then Mr. Gurley, that was his name, Stuart Gurley, he decided it was not safe for two white young women to be working in a black community. So then he was going to assign us somewhere else. Well, Joanie decided she&#8217;d had enough. She went back. She was from the Boston area. She went back to Massachusetts. I can&#8217;t remember now where they were going to send me. No, that was it. They didn&#8217;t have any other place there. So I decided, well, I had made this commitment to stay in VISTA for a year and I wanted to stay. So then they transferred me to Charleston, West Virginia. So that&#8217;s where I ended up for the rest of my VISTA thing.   And the other thing, I think I wrote about this in the book, was there was a rally for George Wallace. This was &#8217;68 and he was running for president. We decided, because some of the local people were going and we decided, most of us went actually. Lenny did not, the black guy. (laughs) He did not go to a George Wallace rally. But Rafe did, the Jewish guy, and several of us went. Well anyway, as it turned out, this rally for George Wallace was a KKK thing. They had the crosses there. They burned the crosses. The rhetoric, I mean, the hate, oh it was awful. I just never had heard anything like that. Of course, they didn&#8217;t know, I think, until-they knew, obviously, we were not from there-but they didn&#8217;t know, I don&#8217;t think it was obvious that Rafe was Jewish or that some of us were Catholic. But some of the things, I mean, I can&#8217;t remember now what it was they said. But one of the VISTAs, she literally got sick in her stomach. It was so awful. It was terrible.
JW: Do you remember who was in the crowd? Was it a mix, men and women and families?
MH: More men than women, if I remember right. I don&#8217;t remember many kids. But some of them had the hoods on and then the general crowd, they didn&#8217;t, but it was just local farmers and people like that.
JW: Had you ever seen the Klan in action before?
MH: No, no. I&#8217;d seen where crosses had been burned, but no, and I sure don&#8217;t want to experience like that again because that was just awful. I&#8217;ve never experienced the awful stuff that came out of those people&#8217;s mouths. It was hatred. That was not a fun evening, but we got out of there okay without any problems. (laughs)
JW: Were you at the VISTA reunion that was-
MH: No.
JW: It was the AV/VISTA reunion.
MH: Right, no, I didn&#8217;t go to that.
JW: Some things came up there. There was a women&#8217;s panel and women were talking about the gender roles in the AVs, some of them, in VISTA. Do you recall that there were certain roles that women were to play and that men were to play, and that those things were talked about in the VISTA?
MH: Again, though, being in the &#8217;60s and the AVs were a little bit later than that, weren&#8217;t they?
JW: No, they were about the same time.
MH: Yeah, that&#8217;s right. They were in the &#8217;60s too. You know, it was just kind of the beginning of the women&#8217;s movement.
JW: And I think that for some of the AVs, they weren&#8217;t talking about it at the time because it was just how things were, but now that they reflect back on it, there was a lot of stuff being talked about, like that they were called &#8220;VISTA dollies&#8221; and things like there. There were certain things that they were supposed to do in the community and then men were to do other things.
MH: Oh right. No, our assignments were all pretty much the same. We were basically supposed to work, go into a community, talk to the people, find out what the needs and problems were, and then try to organize around issues like that. That was pretty much what we were all trained to do. But I do know, yeah, that they encouraged any dating of the VISTAs with the local people and some people didn&#8217;t follow that. I remember that, but other than that, not too much that I recall.
JW: Not where you were.
MH: Yeah.
JW: And so what were your assignments?
MH: Well, in Bedford County, Joanie and I were assigned to this black community, which was rural area, they were spread out, but just again, to go in and get to know the people and talk with them and find out what the issues were, what the problems were, and then what we could do to help them. And I think that&#8217;s what was scary to Mr. Gurley, the VISTA supervisor who was the KKK member, was that he thought if we got in there and got those folks organized, they might start speaking up for their rights and want something. So I think the excuse was it wasn&#8217;t safe for two white girls to go there, but then they didn&#8217;t send anybody else there either. So I think that was it.   So then when I went to West Virginia, yeah, I was pretty much on my own there. I was assigned to a little community right outside of Charleston and it was mixed. It was Appalachian, black, just a mixture of things, and again, low-income. And primarily I did the door-to-door stuff trying to find out what the problems and issues were and got a couple groups together, and I think we got a road paved and started on simple things like that, got people going to the city council meetings and stuff like that. It was a good experience. I think I had a little tiny house there that was furnished. The VISTA supervisor there was very good. Her name was Denise Callahan, and she was from Chicago. She was good. I just kind of reported directly to her and I didn&#8217;t have a whole lot to do with other VISTAs, if I remember right, in West Virginia because there weren&#8217;t, I guess, that many in that area I was working in.  JW: Do you remember the local people you were working with?  MH: Some of them, yeah, and again, I would not have remembered this except I did find some of my notes from West Virginia, one of the council members that we met with, and then there was this one family. I called them &#8220;the crazy mixed-up family.&#8221; They lived in a three-story old house that was falling in, but it was like three generations. It was an older white woman and her daughter, who was white, and I never was quite sure. Some of the kids belonged to the mother or the daughter, but they were very much mixed, black and white. There never seemed to be a man in the house, but there were all these kids. I called them the &#8220;crazy mixed-up family.&#8221; I can&#8217;t remember too many. I guess as far as support, of course, I went to church and I didn&#8217;t get real involved in church there either. Denise was always very supportive. But yeah, as far as individuals, I can&#8217;t remember too many. I remember knocking on a lot of doors, going to a lot of places.   JW: Did you feel like you were successful, that you were reaching people and getting them involved?  MH: I think yeah, the fact that we got a group together and got a few things accomplished and I did identify a couple of the local leaders that I thought would continue on with some of the information that we had given them. I felt it was pretty positive, but I was ready when the year was up.  JW: So can you talk a little bit about what that was like to go from being in these cities working in an insurance company with very sophisticated crowds and going to nice places to moving first and working in a black community, and I assume you hadn&#8217;t had that much interaction with African Americans before, and then going to West Virginia?   MH: Right, yeah. Well, again, I guess I&#8217;ve always felt more comfortable in a rural area, having grown up on a farm. I grew up pretty plain and simple. So it was easy for me to identify with these folks, although I couldn&#8217;t identify with being black and being that prejudiced, but I had suffered when I went to Nashville the prejudice about being Catholic and some of that. So I kind of understood, and I think I&#8217;m just one of those people that I kind of blend in with the woodwork. (laughs) People meet me and then they say, &#8220;I never met you before.&#8221; No, I guess God has given me the gift to be able to relate to a lot of different people. And again, I enjoyed getting to know the black culture more and getting some of the VISTA friends that I had. That was good. Yeah, and then in West Virginia, again it was a pretty diverse, again people that grew up there, people that were transplants, black, white. At that time, there weren&#8217;t any Hispanics there. I guess I always felt comfortable in the rural areas and always felt safer maybe than in a city.   JW: Can you say a little more about your initial motivations to join VISTA?  MH: Well, I was working for the state Senate. One of the things, I was called an &#8220;index clerk,&#8221; and what I would have to do is when the bills were introduced, I would read them and then kind of do a short summary of what it was about and put that on an index thing all on the computer-not, the computer, but the typewriter. And then because I took shorthand and I was a good typist, Jeanie Werner, my supervisor, said that one of the senators, his secretary was not always available and she had some health problems. So she said, &#8220;Would you like to do some dictation from Senator Conlan?&#8221; So I said, &#8220;Sure.&#8221; And he was a very conservative Republican. He was probably in his early 30s, not married, and he took a liking to me. He just liked the work I did, not in a sexual way or anything.   So I ended up doing a lot of work for him and that was interesting, but I was beginning to see his political views were a lot different than mine. And then I also saw just in the Senate how, what do they call it, log rolling? You know how if you vote for this, then I&#8217;ll vote for this for you, and some of this stuff. I didn&#8217;t like some of that political stuff, and I guess I just got to thinking, &#8220;What am I doing here working for these guys?&#8221; Because they were all at that time. I don&#8217;t think there were any women in the Senate. &#8220;Working for these guys and they&#8217;re promoting things that I don&#8217;t really agree with. Why am I here?&#8221;   So that&#8217;s when I decided to and again, it was in the &#8217;60s and VISTA had just been formed and I just thought. And I had, off and on throughout my life, considered going into religious life. I always said I could do the poverty and chastity, but I don&#8217;t think I could do the obedience because back then you didn&#8217;t have any say about where you went or what you did or anything.  I saw this as an alternative maybe to religious life, and I wanted to do something for those that weren&#8217;t as fortunate as I was because I felt I was pretty fortunate being able to do pretty much what I wanted to do. So I guess that was my motivation for going into VISTA.
JW: Did you learn about it because you were working in politics, you were working at the Senate?
MH: You know, I think I had heard about VISTA before I even went to Phoenix. Yeah, because it was before Kennedy got shot when he started VISTA and &#8220;ask not what you can do for your country.&#8221; So I guess that always was kind of in the back of my mind.
JW: And that&#8217;s something we skipped over those years. Do you remember when Kennedy was elected?
MH: Yes, yes. I could not vote for him because back then, you had to be twenty-one to vote and I was twenty the year he was elected. But yeah, I remember that very much and I remember when he was assassinated. I was at my desk at Aetna in Nashville when somebody&#8217;s wife called and said they heard it on the news. I remember that quite vividly.
JW: What do you remember about the election?
MH: Well, just the fact that it was an upset and the fact that he was the first Catholic ever elected and he was young and he had great ideas. Of course, I was young. I was twenty and I was young, too. I remember Paul O&#8217;Keefe was one of the guys that I worked with and he was a Catholic, an Irish Catholic from Connecticut and, of course, he was a big Kennedy supporter. So I remember he was so happy when he was elected. That&#8217;s what I remember about that.
JW: When you finished VISTA, is that when you moved-
MH: To Knoxville.
JW: To Knoxville.
MH: Right.
JW: Okay.
MH: Yeah. And that was kind of interesting how I met the FOCIS people because Denise Callahan, who was my supervisor in West Virginia, she was a friend of Monica&#8217;s [Monica Appleby] and they went to school together, I think. And then she had met Marge Gregg at a cocktail party in Chicago. When she found out I was going to Knoxville, and I was going to Knoxville because one of the guys that I had worked with in Nashville had moved to Knoxville and he offered me a job. So that&#8217;s why I went to Knoxville. So when Denise heard I was going to Knoxville, she said, &#8220;Oh you&#8217;ll have to look up Marge Gregg.&#8221; She said, &#8220;I met her,&#8221; and she said, &#8220;I think you might have a lot in common,&#8221; or something. So she gave me how to get in touch with Marge. Then I had gone down to Knoxville for a UT football game before I actually moved there. So I met Marge then and she said, &#8220;Well, yeah, when you come here, you&#8217;re welcome to stay at the FOCIS House for awhile until you find a place.&#8221; So I did that. So that&#8217;s how I got into the FOCIS thing.
JW: Can you describe meeting the FOCIS members for the first time?
MH: Okay. I met them not all at once, I guess, but I met various ones. Well, Lenoir, because when I first went to the FOCIS House, I shared a room with her and you&#8217;ve probably heard about Lenoir, right? Yeah, so she was a very special lady. She was actually one of the people that encouraged me to go on and get a college degree. I remember her and Jean Marie Luce because Jean Marie was in Knoxville. No, I guess was in Clairfield at that time. And Marie Cirillo and Mary Jo (81:58) are the ones, I guess, I got to know the best, and Marge, of course.   Back then, they were into the FOCIS arts project, trying to do community development through the arts program. That was, again, a totally new concept to me, but it made sense based upon the community organizing that I learned in VISTA and I&#8217;m not really artistic, but I can do some of the secretarial stuff and help out with some of that stuff. So that&#8217;s kind of how I got into working with FOCIS, doing some things with them. And then [I] became a FOCIS member in &#8217;69 and was one of the, I guess the third FOCIS member that was not a Glenmary sister at that time. Now there&#8217;s a lot more now. It seemed like it fit because most of them were Catholic, most of them were single, most of them were involved in community projects and stuff that I was interested in. It was a good fit.   But then I decided that I wanted to get my own apartment. So I got my own apartment eventually. I guess I&#8217;m kind of a loner in a way and I&#8217;ve always worked with people and had a lot of involvement with people, but then when I go home, I just kind of, me and my cats. I&#8217;ve had a few roommates that have worked out fairly well, but I kind of like living by myself.  JW: So I saw that in Knoxville, you were working in the Fourth and Gill neighborhood. You were doing some community work there.  MH: Right.  JW: Can you say what your goals were and what that neighborhood was like at that point?  MH: Yeah. Again, that started with one of the FOCIS arts projects and they were into the artsy kind of stuff, but I&#8217;m thinking what I did then was, let&#8217;s see. I&#8217;m getting my timelines confused now because I can&#8217;t remember if I was involved with the Fourth and Gill initially or later when I came back to Knoxville because see, I moved to Clairfield from Knoxville and then I came back to Knoxville. One of the things I know I did later after I came back to Knoxville in the Fourth and Gill area was I did training, paralegal training, and teaching them how, community members and some of the people that were working there, how to go about getting Social Security and SSI benefits and about their rights as tenants and things like that. I remember distinctly doing that when I came back after I had been trained as a paralegal. I think I probably just kind of was a support person in the early days in Fourth and Gill.  JW: Can you say what your impressions were of the Glenmary sisters and them leaving the order to make this other organization?  MH: And again, I kind of fit right in because they&#8217;re all pretty independent and I certainly understood their frustration with the church hierarchy and their reasons for wanting to form FOCIS. So yeah, I was impressed with them. I just felt, wow, this is a great group. Well, Lenoir was older and Katherine Grimslock was older, but the rest of us were all pretty much about the same age. It just was a neat group to be involved in, and they had great parties at the FOCIS House out on Sullivan Road, great parties and good food. That was just a good group.  JW: So then in &#8217;71, you moved to Clairfield, but had you--?  MH: I had been going up there a couple days a week, just again, volunteering and working with--. They were trying to get the pallet factory started, and I worked some with the craft group, primarily, when I first started going, helping them with bookkeeping and things like that, to get books set up and that kind of stuff. Then after I got up there and got some training as a paralegal, then I worked a lot with helping people get their black lung benefits and miner&#8217;s pension and Social Security, disability benefits. That was a big part of what I did, and then helped with getting the groups incorporated, those kind of things.   JW: Were you working at all with the Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange group? Were they set up yet?  MH: No, I think they got set up about the time that I left. They were in Jellico there, yeah, right.  JW: When you were in Clairfield, was the anti-strip mining stuff starting up yet?  MH: Yeah. SOCM [Save Our Cumberland Mountains] got started then. Yeah, because I can remember Marie was always afraid her house was going to get--. Well, she did have some stuff burn down, but she was always--. And she was threatened several times. Now I never was because again, I didn&#8217;t live with Marie. I lived separately and I wasn&#8217;t as involved openly with SOCM. I always supported them, but I was involved more with the legal services part. But yeah, I certainly was supportive of what they were doing.  JW: Can you talk a little bit about your move into legal services and how that related to the community organizing? It seems like you made a transition after VISTA a little bit.  MH: Yeah. Well, again, see, I went to work for the insurance agency in Knoxville and again, I was doing well and they were about to put me in charge of this personal accounts department, which was just me and one other guy. I started studying to be licensed as an underwriter and then, I don&#8217;t know, it just kind of struck me one day: I&#8217;m working so hard for these guys and this company, this agency, which insurance is important, but what am I doing for humanity, I guess I got to thinking. Why don&#8217;t I do something? I think that went back to the VISTA experience. So that&#8217;s when I started going up to Clairfield one day a week. I was still working and helping out up there, and it just seemed like such a need for the things that I could help them with. And again, based on my VISTA experience, you go in and you listen to what the needs are and then you try to help solve the problem. So then I started going two days a week and then I decided, &#8220;I think I&#8217;m going to move up here.&#8221;   God has provided for me every time I&#8217;ve gone from one thing to another; it&#8217;s worked out. So Marie managed to come up with some money from the diocese to pay me something. So I started working with the pallet factory and this is when all the miner&#8217;s pension and the black lung thing came up. People, they didn&#8217;t know how to go about getting their benefits. I started working with Greg O&#8217;Connor, who was a Knoxville attorney and he would come up to Clairfield. So then we got the legal services office. I got a Ford Fellowship grant to help us get the office set up, and then he trained me as a paralegal and I went off to some paralegal training and started doing--. A big part of what we did were benefits things. I enjoyed that. That was really helping people and getting to know the law and everything, and again, the frustration with the coal companies and the Labor Department and all that stuff.   It was kind of natural for being a paralegal for me because it just seemed like it worked. And then I thought about going to law school, and I applied to the University of New Mexico because they have an Indian law thing because I was kind of interested in that, too. I guess that was when I came back to Knoxville before I moved here. But I was not accepted. I&#8217;m sure they got tons of applicants, and I was not a Native American either. So anyway, then I decided, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;ll stay with being a paralegal.&#8221; It was good because I lived up there four years, but then again, I felt like it was time. I had pretty much done what I needed to do up there. And Clairfield, have you been to Clairfield?  JW: No.  MH: Yeah, okay.  JW: I&#8217;ve been to Jellico and that area.  MH: It&#8217;s much more isolated than Jellico. So I figured, &#8220;Well, I think I&#8217;ll go back to Knoxville,&#8221; and actually I got a grant through CORA [Commission on Religion in Appalachia] to do paralegal training and that&#8217;s how I first came to Cherokee because one of the attorneys that I had worked with [in] Clairfield after Greg quit coming, Don Laroche, came up there. One of his buddies that he went to law school at UT in Knoxville was with the legal services program that was starting here in Cherokee. When we got the grant from CORA, we included Cherokee as one of the places I would go to do paralegal training. So that&#8217;s how I first got to Cherokee.  JW: And what year did you move here officially?  MH: &#8217;78. Yeah, because that grant was, what, one year or two years, I can&#8217;t remember, at least one year. And then I kept in touch with some of the folks here and then they called me when they had an opening, when they got some additional funding and had a position for a community educator and paralegal supervisor. So they called me and asked if I would and the grant that I had was running out, so, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;ll come.&#8221; I remember Joyce Dukes came down with me to look at the place where I was going to live, which was not a very nice place. It was nice, but it was an older house and way back, back up in Big Cove, which is one of the more traditional communities. Joyce and I came down. I remember it was raining. I moved here in November. So it was like a rainy October day, I guess, we came down and I looked at the place. Joyce says, &#8220;How long do you think you&#8217;re going to stay here?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Oh, anywhere from two years to the rest of my life.&#8221; (laughs)  JW: And you&#8217;ve been here how long?  MH: It will be thirty-two years. So I guess it&#8217;s going to be the rest of my life. The first time I ever came here, my sister and I came through here in the &#8217;60s. It was right after I learned to drive and got a car. It was in the summertime and she was out of school. We came down here on a vacation to the Smokies and I remember I really liked it. And then after I came here a couple times with legal services to do the training, it just kind of felt like home. It just felt so comfortable. So I&#8217;ve been here ever since.  JW: What were you working on in those early years once you moved here?  MH: When I first came here? The legal services office initially was just in Cherokee up by the Methodist Church. I was doing paralegal work and then I was training local people to be paralegals. Then I did a lot of community education work. Initially it was just here on the boundary, but then they moved the main office to Sylva and my office was in Sylva. And then we also had an office in Andrews, and plus one, we kept a small office here in Cherokee. So my territory was the seven counties to work with, again, some community organizing and getting client councils started, groups of clients to organize around issues, doing community education around tenants&#8217; rights, consumer rights, benefits rights, things like that. So I had the seven counties that I would meet with different community groups or, if there was not one, try to get one started.   JW: It sounds like a lot of work.  MH: Yeah, yeah, but I enjoyed it. It was good. Some counties we didn&#8217;t do as much because there just wasn&#8217;t that much of a need or the people didn&#8217;t ask for it. And then I still handled a small caseload of benefits cases and then supervised the two or three paralegals. It was good, but then the funding ran out in &#8217;81 because that&#8217;s when Reaganomics, all the budget cutbacks. So we went from a staff of twenty-five in three offices down to eight people in one office, and my position was one that they said that they could get along without because, basically, they ended up keeping like one secretary, two paralegals, and the rest attorneys.   So about the same time when Fr. Frank Gardner was the pastor here and at Bryson City, when he found out I was going to be losing my job, he said, &#8220;Would you consider coming to work for the Catholic Church kind of pretty much doing what you&#8217;ve been doing, but just in Cherokee, primarily Cherokee, and a little bit in Bryson City?&#8221; So I said yes because I had a lot of things going here that I didn&#8217;t want to drop. So he hired me as, again, a community educator and paralegal was my title. I worked primarily in Cherokee, although I did help some of the groups in Bryson City. And he managed, through Glenmary and other things, managed to get funding. So it just kind of went from there. So I did that until--. During that time was when I helped form a lot of the community groups here, SAFE and the Yogi Crowe Scholarship and Mountain Mediation. Those are some of the ones I can think of right now and others that have not stayed together, but that have fallen apart.   I loved it. I know I&#8217;m the type of person that I could not sit at a desk anymore and  do the same thing all day like I used to. So it had enough variety of things that I liked doing and I loved teaching, training people. I think that&#8217;s my real gift to be able to do that. It just worked out well. So I did that. Fr. Frank died in &#8217;91 and I was still doing it then, and then Fr. Tom Field came and he was very supportive. But the funding, we were, at that time, being funded through the diocese. Well, they were cutting back on the funding. There were two sisters here that used to live in the trailer, and so they were funded by the diocese and I was funded by the diocese.   So it came down after Fr. Tom came, they said that they did not have funding for all of us. So Fr. Tom recommended because the sisters were old, Roberta was in her 70s, Virginia was in her late 60s, I think, and they didn&#8217;t do a lot in the community-Roberta at one time taught at the high school and then Virginia gave piano lessons, but they did some in the community, but not a whole lot. So anyway, Fr. Tom recommended that the sisters retire and that I stay on. Well, the sisters had enough clout with the diocese that they said, &#8220;No, the sisters will stay.&#8221;   So Fr. Tom, through Glenmary, got a grant for a year. I&#8217;ve forgotten what my title was now. I&#8217;d have to go back and look. So I worked primarily with him, again, continuing doing some of the community work, but also helping him with some of the parish work. And then after the Glenmary money ran out, we had applied for some grants. We got a couple small grants, but he said, Mary said, &#8220;I think you&#8217;re going to have to look for another job.&#8221;   And I was a guardian ad litem volunteer and they had an opening for a guardian ad litem program supervisor. So I applied for that and got that and then I continued working for Fr. Tom for, I think, ten hours a week for a year or two and then after that, when that money ran out, I just volunteered and helped him. But the guardian ad litem supervisor job was supposed to be a thirty-hour-a-week job, but it was a lot more than that, but I stayed with that for six years. It was good, but it was very frustrating with the court system and the continuances and the parents. I don&#8217;t know. Are you familiar with the guardian ad litem program?  JW: I&#8217;m not. Can you say what it is?  MH: Okay. It&#8217;s also in some states called court-appointed something advocates. What does the &#8220;S&#8221; stand for? Anyway, it&#8217;s when kids have been removed from the home by Social Services, placed in the custody of DSS custody, either placed in foster homes or with relatives, and the guardian ad litem volunteer is like the advocate for the child. You would interview the child and get the child&#8217;s perspective. You would interview the parents, all parties, and then make a recommendation to the court as what is in the child&#8217;s best interest.   And I had been a volunteer for about six years before I got the job. My job again as the program supervisor was to recruit and train volunteers and then supervise them and help them write their court reports and that and then be in court that the cases were in court. Again, I enjoyed the training. I had some wonderful volunteers. Some were not as cooperative as others, but it was good. But the clincher with that, and I was getting more and more frustrated with the continuances in court because a year in the life of an adult is not a long time. A year in the life of a child is a long time, and if these cases kept getting continued, continued, continued, the kid was kind of in limbo; they didn&#8217;t know. And the parents, a lot of them had substance abuse problems and they would go through treatment or they would do something they said they were going to do for awhile, and then they&#8217;d fall back. So the poor kids were being bounced around. It was hard. It was hard to see that happen to those kids.   Then the clincher was my office was in Bryson City, but I had Macon County, which is Franklin; Jackson County, which is Sylva; Swain County, Bryson City; and the boundary. So I had basically four areas that I supervised and had to go to court in all those places different days. That wasn&#8217;t too bad, but then they wanted me, for no extra pay and no extra hours, doing all that thirty hours a week and I was working forty or forty-five, fifty most weeks. Then they wanted me to go to spend ten hours a week in the office in Murphy doing a database on a computer. And I said, &#8220;No, I&#8217;m not going to do that.&#8221; The travel and at that time, I was having back and neck problems from sitting at the computer a long time. So I just said no. This was in October I decided. I said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll work until the end of the year.&#8221;   That was &#8217;99. Again, didn&#8217;t know what I was going to do, but Fr. Tom was still here and he said, &#8220;I think Glenmary has some money for multicultural workers. Would you want--?&#8221; And he had Parkinson&#8217;s and he was failing and he said, &#8220;I need help. I need help in the office and I need your help with RCIA and other things in the parish.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;I want you to continue doing what you&#8217;re doing in Cherokee.&#8221; Anyway, he got money for a year for funding for me to be a multicultural worker. Well, that started in January of 2000 and his Parkinson&#8217;s had progressed to the point that he really couldn&#8217;t continue. So he said he was going to be leaving in July and Glenmary did not have anybody to send.   So the parishes here in Byson went to the diocese and they sent a diocesan priest. Well, he was one of these young, rigid, very conservative guys that did not see a need for anything I was doing and did not want me to have anything to do with the office. But there was still money there for the rest of the year. So Fr. George Closter, who is a priest at Murphy, who is a good friend of mine, I&#8217;ve known him a long time and he&#8217;s the vicar for our vicariate. Are you familiar with vicariates? Okay, you&#8217;re not Catholic.  JW: I&#8217;m not Catholic.  MH: Okay. Vicariates are like districts, like the Methodist Church has districts.   JW: Okay.  MH: It&#8217;s like these seven counties out here.  JW: I grew up Methodist, so I can understand that.  MH: Yeah, districts, okay. So he&#8217;s the vicar of the vicariate. The vicariate is similar to a district. So he would be like the district supervisor, I think they call them in the Methodist Church. He&#8217;s kind of the supervisor for the vicariate. He (106:58) all the priests and whatever goes on around here, plus being a pastor and everything. But anyway, George and I are good friends. So I talked to him and I said, &#8220;George,&#8221; I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m willing to work. I would like to continue staying here and continue working in Cherokee.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;The Glenmary money is there for the rest of this year. What do you think about seeing if the diocese, transfer that money to the diocese and let me work for the diocese?&#8221; So he said, &#8220;I think we can do that.&#8221; So he checked with the diocese first and they said yes if Fr. Ray was willing to release the money, and he was. I&#8217;ll say that for him; he did. He&#8217;s the pastor here.   So that was a twenty-hour-a-week position and then again (108) (laughs) Creator in the sky. I get a call from George and there was a position opening up for a Faith Formation consultant to work in the seven counties, to work in the parishes here, and again, basically, training catechists or Sunday school teachers, you would call them, training them and being a resource person to the parishes. We had recommended through the vicariate that it be someone that lived in Swain because it used to be one person that lived in Asheville that handled the Asheville vicariate and the Smoky Mountain vicariate. Well, that wasn&#8217;t working because we always got left out. So we recommended that there be a person working part-time in this vicariate, based in this vicariate, and the diocese went along with that.   Well, they advertised and they advertised and they got people that applied, but nobody that was either capable or nobody that was willing to work for that amount of money because it was a twenty-hour-a-week position. So I get this call from George Closter: &#8220;Mary, would you ever consider taking that Faith Formation job along with the multicultural rep?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Let me think about that.&#8221; So I thought about it and I got a little more information about what it entailed, and usually they required a masters degree for that, which I don&#8217;t have, but I was in the lay ministry program, which is a prerequisite for a lot of things. So they interviewed me and said since I was in the lay ministry, since I had had so much experience working with the parish and everything, that they would waive the masters requirement.  So I had a forty-hour-a-week job, but both of which took a little more than that, but with benefits. That was the good thing, with benefits, with retirement and with medical. I stayed with that until 2006 and I was getting tired because again, it involved a lot of travel, a lot of night meetings and stuff. I just felt like it&#8217;s-because I was, what, sixty-six. I&#8217;d work[ed] since I was seventeen and I wanted to be able to travel and do some stuff while I could still get around. So I retired and I&#8217;m still involved with some of the groups here in Cherokee and I&#8217;m involved with the church in different things, but it&#8217;s more on my schedule now.  JW: So as you know, our project is about the women&#8217;s movement in the Southeast and we&#8217;re thinking about how the activism and movement in this area, be it Cherokee or the other places that you lived in the South, relate to what&#8217;s going on nationally and what&#8217;s specific to these places. So I was wondering if you could say how you began to think about the women&#8217;s movement and if there was a point when you got involved and what that process was like.  MH: I guess it was kind of a gradual thing because I certainly was not one of the bra-burning type, but I knew people who were and I was okay with that. If that was what they wanted to do, that&#8217;s fine. I think the FOCIS women certainly were a big influence on me and just being kind of the independent person I am. And I think again, the older I got, the more self-confident I got being able to speak up more and get involved in more controversial things that I probably would not have done before. But I guess I wouldn&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve been a real activist on women&#8217;s issues, but, well, maybe I shouldn&#8217;t say that as I think about some of the stuff I&#8217;ve done, just trying to educate women. It seemed to be more women than any, as to what their rights were in employment and stuff like that. Because I can remember when I got my first credit card, Sears was the only place that would issue a credit card to a single woman.  JW: So that&#8217;s where you got it.  MH: So that&#8217;s where I got my first credit card and then in the &#8217;70s and &#8217;80s, there was a lot of legislation that opened that up for women, but yeah, before that, if you weren&#8217;t married, you couldn&#8217;t get a credit card and it was in your husband&#8217;s name. So I&#8217;ve seen a lot of changes like that. It&#8217;s been a good time to be a part of seeing that happen. Here on the boundary, because Cherokees, you may or may not know, are a matriarchal society and it&#8217;s always been the women that have been more progressive in many ways, and just getting to know people like Amy and Patty and working with them on projects and seeing what--. And again, as somebody has often said around here, if you want anything done, get the women to do it. And I think that&#8217;s why I fit in so well here, again, being an independent, strong woman. I kind of did my own thing.  JW: Well, I noticed in both your book and I think in a little history that was written about the Knoxville Women&#8217;s Center that you wrote a pamphlet called &#8220;Women&#8217;s Legal Rights in Tennessee.&#8221; So do you remember how you got involved in doing something like that?  MH: Yeah. At that time, I think that&#8217;s when I was working, it was either with CORA doing the paralegal training or I also did a paralegal training through UT, through the legal clinic, and I got to know Jennifer Helton-Small, or is it Small-Helton, Helton-Small? And she was a law student, well, then she was a lawyer; she got admitted to the bar. Anyway, I got to know her and Joyce Dukes and Margie and a couple of my friends, we&#8217;d gotten involved with the women&#8217;s center in Knoxville. And again, it was one of those things, women didn&#8217;t know what their rights were. So Jennifer and I decided we were going to write, do this little pamphlet on women&#8217;s legal rights. So I did some of the research and writing and she did some, and then, her being the lawyer, she approved what we did. I think that was a good thing and I still have a copy or two of that, and we made it available to the women&#8217;s center and to different places.   JW: Did you ever do workshops or anything like that along with it?  MH: Yeah, some. Again, Jennifer and I worked, did a couple, I know, because I remember I did one on Social Security. In fact, the reason I remember this is I found a clipping about it. It was in the Knoxville News Sentinel. But yeah, we did some workshops both at the women&#8217;s center and I think we did some at UT as well. And then also Candy Culand was a law student and she was a member of the Lawyers Guild, which was kind of the left-wing of the American Bar Association. So I worked with her on a couple projects, too. I wonder what ever happened to her?  JW: I don&#8217;t know.  MH: Right, yeah. I know she got her law degree, but I don&#8217;t know what ever happened. I lost track of a lot of those folks. And what was her name, Susan Conley, was the director of the Knoxville Women&#8217;s Center, the Rape Crisis Center. Yeah, I did some workshops for her there.   JW: And I saw also you were on the board of the Knoxville Women&#8217;s Center and the Rape Crisis Center.  MH: I guess I was for awhile, yeah, right.   JW: So those are pretty out there women&#8217;s movement sorts of activities.  MH: Right, yeah.  JW: Do you recall any stories from those--? That would be like &#8217;75, &#8217;76, around there.  MH: Yeah, gosh. I just remember getting together there with some of the women, like support groups, because a lot of them were going through divorces and things. Yeah, it was more informal in some ways. It was certainly meeting a great need for a lot of people. And Susan was good as the director. She tried to teach me to play tennis. (laughs) She was a tennis player and I tried, but I&#8217;m not very well-coordinated.  JW: So your involvement in both the women&#8217;s center and the rape crisis center was through your paralegal training and knowledge?  MH: Pretty much, right, and just being concerned about women&#8217;s issues. I guess I had a lot of friends, too, like Joyce and Margie and almost everybody I knew, had gone through a divorce or was going through a divorce and just kind of walking with them through what was happening.  JW: So I think divorce is so common now and not that it&#8217;s easy now, but I think people just know a lot more about it. So what were some of the issues or problems that women were facing then when they were going through a divorce?  MH: Well, I think for many, again it was the child custody because usually there were children, financial because a lot of them had been stay-at-home moms. I guess those were the two main things. Visitation with the kids, how much the father would see the kids, and those kind of things. And some were fairly friendly divorces, but many were not. It was a hard time for a lot of people that I knew at that time. I was glad I wasn&#8217;t married. (laughs) I&#8217;ve often said that I would rather be unhappy single than unhappy married. I could never say I was ever really, totally unhappy single.   JW: But you saw a lot of unhappy marriages.  MH: Right.  JW: So then when once you&#8217;d moved here, I saw that you were involved with a lot of community activities that had a major impact on women. Can you say a little bit about some of the things you were doing and why there seemed to be a particular need for women in Cherokee?  MH: Right, yeah, okay. And I guess the one that I&#8217;m most proud of, or one of the proudest I am, was with the SAFE program, the domestic violence program. And again, having worked with legal services, having worked in the community, and having just talked with people, it was such a problem and there was just no place for the women to go. They stayed in situations that they just should not have been in and, again, thinking about the effect it had on the children.  Let&#8217;s see, yeah, because I was working for the church then, and I was still doing quite a bit of paralegal stuff and, again, a lot of people came wanting divorces and that or were in bad situations. It was when I was still with legal services. So it went back that far. There was a woman in Cherokee County, in Murphy, that started a task force on domestic violence and, working with legal services, I started going to those task force meetings. Actually, she got a grant and got the first program going down in Cherokee County, the REACH program, it&#8217;s called there. I was somewhat familiar with how to go about doing that.   I think somebody from the North Carolina Public Safety came to do a presentation about domestic violence. I went to that and there were people there from Social Services and the hospital and everything, and we all said, &#8220;We&#8217;ve got a problem here. We need to do something.&#8221; We formed a task force here and then that&#8217;s when we decided we would get incorporated as SAFE, which stands for Shelter, Advocacy, Feelings, and Education. So we formed that and I helped with the bylaws and getting it incorporated and all that, then got some grant money and was able to hire a director and that&#8217;s when we hired Lisa. Were you able to talk with her?  JW: No, not yet. I hope we can.  MH: Yeah, I hope you can, too, because she did a lot with the domestic violence program here. I got it started and I was on the board, but she was the heart and soul of it and actually, she was not our first choice. Our first choice was a Cherokee woman and then she decided not to take it, which was a blessing because Lisa has the creativity and the vision and the compassion. She really made it work. Yeah, and that&#8217;s one group that&#8217;s still going. And then the Yogi Crowe Scholarship Fund, that was not set up specifically for women, but it was for anyone to go to graduate school or for their doctorate, but most of our grant recipients have been women. Patty was one of our recipients and Amy&#8217;s daughter, Becky, was one of our recipients. That&#8217;s still going. Our goal when we started out for the endowment was a hundred thousand dollars, which back then was a lot of money because interest rates were like fifteen percent. So we thought if we had a hundred thousand dollars, that would be enough money for us to give grants. So we finally got a couple years ago, 2007, we got up to half a million and then the stock market went down. So we&#8217;re back up now to four ninety-three. So we&#8217;re working our way back up, but we&#8217;ve helped like seventy-four, seventy-five Cherokees to get their--.  JW: And to come back or stay here after graduation.  MH: Right, yeah. Quite a few now. We&#8217;ve helped a few that actually never lived here initially and they&#8217;ve not come back, but most of them that lived here, that grew up here or grew up close by, have come here.   JW: I also saw that you were involved with the Committee on the Status of Women in Swain County. Can you say a little bit about what that committee did and how you started it?  MH: Yeah. It didn&#8217;t last very long. It was one of those that didn&#8217;t last very long. Some of it came out of some of the folks with SAFE, I think, that were on the SAFE board. Again, I think it was somebody from the governor&#8217;s office that came and they were trying to get these councils set up in different counties. So I met with them and some other women and we just said, &#8220;Yeah, let&#8217;s start a group here.&#8221; We didn&#8217;t do a whole lot, and I can&#8217;t remember now what we did. But it was one of those, I was involved with so many other things at that time that I just didn&#8217;t have a lot of energy to put into that and evidently, whoever else was involved with that didn&#8217;t either. So it kind of fizzled out. Yeah, that&#8217;s true. There have been a lot of things that I worked with to get started and then if I didn&#8217;t stay with it or if you didn&#8217;t have somebody that was really committed to it, it just kind of fizzles out. And it&#8217;s hard to get people to make commitments to stay with things and it&#8217;s not just here; it&#8217;s all over. It&#8217;s like they want immediate results. If they don&#8217;t see things happening right away, they get discouraged and give up and you can&#8217;t do that. Fr. Tom used to say I was as tenacious as a bulldog. (laughs)   JW: Can you say a little bit about your faith and how religion has influenced you? I noticed reading through your book that you&#8217;ve been pretty broad-minded. You&#8217;ve explored lots of types of faith. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that.   MH: Yeah. Well, again, I think I&#8217;ve been blessed with the gift of faith. Amy one time asked me, &#8220;Why do you stay with the Catholic Church with the way that they treat women and everything?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Well, I sort of feel like I do about voting. If I don&#8217;t vote, I don&#8217;t have a right to complain. If I stay in the church maybe, I mean, I&#8217;m not going to make a lot of progress, but maybe I can make a few changes in it.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m getting more and more frustrated these days.   I grew up Catholic and it&#8217;s been, I guess, a testament to my faith, the places that I&#8217;ve lived that were not Catholic, and that&#8217;s where I really learned about my faith was when I had to try to explain it to people that had never met a Catholic before. I think, I still believe in the Catholic Church. I don&#8217;t believe in a lot of the things that the hierarchy, that they&#8217;re doing these--. And that whole sexual abuse thing. That has just been awful and the fact that they won&#8217;t consider married clergy, the fact that they won&#8217;t consider women being ordained. I just think it&#8217;s prehistoric. They need to get with the times. And I&#8217;ve had some very, very good priest friends and a lot of my friends are former sisters and priests, in addition to the FOCIS people. I&#8217;ve enjoyed learning about other faiths. And I think the Eucharist, communion, is probably what has kept me with the Catholic Church as long as I&#8217;m still with it. Fr. Frank Gardner was very open-minded, Fr. Tom was too, to ecumenical things, working with other denominations.   I&#8217;ve explored going to other churches. They&#8217;re nice, but it still doesn&#8217;t have what I&#8217;m used to. And then getting into the Native American spirituality, to me, there&#8217;s many similarities to the Catholic Church with some of the ritual and the symbolism and all that. I don&#8217;t know. To me, we all were created by the same God and we may look at things a little differently and go in different directions, but we all have the same ultimate goal. So why not work together and be open and not criticize people because they&#8217;re Baptist or Methodist or Presbyterian or whatever?   JW: What have you enjoyed most about being an activist and active community member in this community?  MH: This community, well, I guess, as well as all of them, but probably more here because I&#8217;ve been here longer than any place else, just seeing how people have grown and how the tribe has progressed from the time when I first came, being able to use the gifts that I have to help get some of these groups started and keeping them going, seeing how the leadership of some of the people that I&#8217;ve known, that I&#8217;ve worked with, and have helped through the scholarship fund and things, how they&#8217;re now in leadership positions. It kind of makes you feel like a proud parent.  JW: What have been some of the challenges?  MH: (laughs) Again, the close-mindedness of some people and the disappointments when I know people have a lot more ability than they, when they don&#8217;t use their talents and skills when they could, and those that have gotten into drugs and alcohol and kind of messed up their lives or not developing to their fullest potential. It&#8217;s a sadness because you see some of that, but there&#8217;s also been a lot of others that have overcome a lot, that are doing quite well. So it&#8217;s good to see that and sometimes it just takes building a little confidence, and I think that&#8217;s what happened to me. As I got a little older and a little more self-confident, I thought, &#8220;Hey, I can do that.&#8221; And I think people just need to be told that it&#8217;s okay, that they can do it, and a little encouragement and sometimes a little training or skills help along the way. And I&#8217;ve certainly had a lot of people that helped me throughout my life.  JW: Can you say who some of your role models or mentors were, maybe the most influential people?  MH: Okay, gosh. Well, Lenoir, for one, with FOCIS, and I guess my mom in some ways, in spite of her, I guess, sometimes I say, (laughs) because she certainly was resilient. And some of the Glenmary priests, Fr. Frank and Fr. Tom. Gosh, there&#8217;s probably a lot more I&#8217;m not thinking about right now. And Amy in some ways, although we&#8217;ve kind of grown together in some ways, but just seeing her kind of evolve, too. And I guess maybe my Aunt Lula in some ways, although I didn&#8217;t know her real well growing up, but as I got older, I would try to visit her and just the fact that she was a pretty independent lady, I guess, indirectly, probably subconsciously.  JW: What did your Aunt Lula do for a living or what was it about her?  MH: She was just a housewife. She never had any children. When my mom&#8217;s parents and her parents died, she went to live with an older couple and she kind of did housework and stuff. Well, then after I think she was eleven or twelve at that time, after ten years or so, the woman died. So Aunt Lula married the guy, Minor Teague was his name, and he was like thirty or forty years older than her. So she married him and then stayed married to him until he died. And then after he died, she stayed single for a while, but then she married a widower who had six or eight kids and they were all adults, except one was a teenager. So she kind of helped raise up the teenager. But yeah, she never worked outside the home or anything, but the fact that she would, in a Model-T Ford, drive from Kentucky to Illinois by herself in the 1920s, she was pretty gutsy. She always had a dog. She had a dog. I&#8217;ve got pictures of her with her dog. It rode with her in her car and Mom always talked about her dog. So I guess again in some subconscious way, maybe she was a role model.  And then Mrs. Leverins, my teacher in the country school, the one-room country school, I think she was in many ways certainly a good influence on me.   JW: If this is a question that you don&#8217;t want to answer, you don&#8217;t have to, but I was thinking about you&#8217;ve mentioned being a single women and having independence and being able to do all these really incredible things in your life. But we also live in a culture where marriage is, I&#8217;m not sure how to, there&#8217;s pressure put on people to get married. There&#8217;s a certain status that marriage holds in our community, whether it be financially--.  MH: It used to be, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s there as much anymore.  JW: Yeah, maybe not as much anymore. But I wonder if you could say something about how that&#8217;s affected your own life or if you ever thought about that or any challenges you faced because you weren&#8217;t married in a culture where a lot of people are.  MH: I guess not really because when I was in the &#8217;60s, yeah, when I was in my 20s, of course, most of my classmates and everybody that I knew had gotten married. And I think that&#8217;s why I fit in so well with FOCIS, because most of them were not married at that time. Some of them are now. It seemed to me like there was not as much of a stigma when I was in my late 20s as it was when I was in my early, like when I [was] growing up. You either got married or you went into the convent. That was pretty much it. I can remember when I was fifteen or sixteen, I used to say, &#8220;Oh I want six kids, four boys and two girls.&#8221; (laughs) And I was even picking out names for them. Well, then after I started doing babysitting, (laughs), I just thought, &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure about that.&#8221;   And I guess my parents&#8217; marriage was not awful, but it was not wonderful either. Then, having seen so many of my friends go through divorces and a lot of my friends that were in unhappy marriages that stayed with it for the sake of the kids, which probably was not the best idea. It just never did seem like the right person came along. And I think now, so many people live together without getting married and a lot of people don&#8217;t get married at all and there&#8217;s no big deal about it. I don&#8217;t think I would have ever done that, lived together without getting married. I think I&#8217;m still Catholic enough, old-fashioned enough that I probably would have gotten married.   Everyone once in a while, somebody will ask me that: &#8220;Well, don&#8217;t you miss having a family, having children and that?&#8221; And I say, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve got children in different ways. I&#8217;ve got community organizations and I&#8217;ve got friends that have children. And when I was the guardian ad litem program supervisor, all those kids, I kind of felt like responsible for.&#8221; I said, &#8220;You know, it&#8217;s just something that I haven&#8217;t really missed.&#8221; Now I have some friends that they just, they have to have children. They just wanted to have children so bad, but I never felt that way. I just felt like--. I still say, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t ruled out marriage yet,&#8221; but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to happen and I&#8217;m not looking for it because I&#8217;m pretty set in my ways. I think it&#8217;d be very hard to live with someone.   But I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s the stigma because it used to be, yeah, because you either went into the convent, got married, and, of course, it wasn&#8217;t talked about back when I was younger, but if you were in a lesbian relationship, of course, nobody talked about that. But there were always whispers. I think it&#8217;s a much more open society today.   JW: We&#8217;ve talked about your faith and we&#8217;ve talked about your activism. Can you say how the two are related?  MH: Yeah. I think, you&#8217;re not familiar with Catholic social teachings, but that&#8217;s always been a big part of my faith, the Catholic social teachings of helping others, the dignity of the human person, care of creation. All those are Catholic social teachings. To me, the activism is just a way of putting my faith into action, and I&#8217;ve been fortunate to be able to do that through different grants and different programs that I&#8217;ve been able to do.  JW: So what is your hope for the future for this community that has become your home?  MH: Okay. I guess, yeah, I wrote something about that not too long ago and I wonder how did I say that? Well, my hope is that it&#8217;s a drug-free community with more people learning and living the culture, the traditional Cherokee culture, which a lot of people have lost. And I think that&#8217;s the reason the substance abuse problem is so bad because they&#8217;ve lost the culture. And I think the two need to come together, and I think that&#8217;s my hope that there&#8217;d be a drug-free community living as Cherokees want to live, not as they have been told they have to live, should live.   JW: Are there any final reflections or other themes that you would like to touch upon?  MH: Just that I&#8217;ve been very blessed to have been able to stay here as many years as I have, and every place that I&#8217;ve been, but this is really home. It just feels like it&#8217;s where I&#8217;m meant to be. I&#8217;ve been very blessed and I&#8217;ve learned much more than I have taught to a lot of people. It&#8217;s just been a good life.   JW: Well, thank you so much.  MH: Okay, thank you. I was honored to be interviewed for this.
