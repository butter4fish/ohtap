Speaker 1: Larry Crowe, I'm interviewer for The HistoryMakers today. Our videographer is Scott Stearns. Sir, could you please state your name and spell it for us please.
Speaker 2: John Henry Murphy III. J-O-H-N, H-E-N-R-Y, M-U-R-P-H-Y, number three R-D.
Speaker 1: Okay. That's pretty good. Can you give us your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Date of birth is March 2nd, 1916, Mercy Hospital, Baltimore Maryland.
Speaker 1: Okay. And what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I been in the newspaper business all my life. From--office boy to chairman of the board.
Speaker 1: Okay. And this is with the--?
Speaker 2: Afro-American Newspapers.
Speaker 1: (Off-camera discussion)
Speaker 2: All right and sir, what is today's date and--?
Speaker 1: September 21st, 2003 A.D.
Speaker 2: Good, good. That might be important one day.

Story_ID: 18840
Speaker 1: What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food really is seafood. And it really doesn't make much difference what it is. Shrimp, scallops, crab. I can make a meal off of seafood.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Tan, brown. Ever since I grew up my mother always give me brown shoes, brown socks. So brown turned out to be it.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Really it's--really autumn is my time of the year but I love spring 'cause that's when you do your planting. But you see the results of it in October, September and October. So both of them are my favorites. Not crazy about winter. And the summer is here 'cause it separates spring from autumn.
Speaker 1: Okay. Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I'm a land person. I love--the two best locations in the United States is San Francisco [California] and New Orleans [Louisiana]. And foreign country, I've visited some, but none I particularly want to go back to.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I really don't know if I have any favorite phrases or not. When you're talking to your kids I tell them that, never tell some body I told you so. Because that rubs the salt in and they already know you told them. So that's a good little piece of philosophy.  It take--keeps you out of arguments and let's you get along better with your wife.  'Cause all of us are gonna make mistakes. So you remind them of it--just let it go.
Story_ID: 18841
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about your family history. What was your--well give me your parents names and spell them for me and their dates and places of birth?
Speaker 2: Okay. Well I'll do the best I can with that.  We were just going through some that in a file which we keep. So you'll get dates right in your obituary. But my mother is Sarah spelled with an H. S-A-R-A-H, Clements, C-L-E-M-E-N-T-S, Murphy. My father is Daniel D-A-N-I-E-L, Howard, H-O-W-A-R-D, Murphy, M-U-R-P-H-Y and I think he was born in Baltimore [Maryland] as well as my mother. If they'd read this it'll be all--told you the wrong thing but since they don't read well enough.
Speaker 1: Okay. So do you know the date of birth for them?
Speaker 2: No. Both of the were in the 1800s. But that's as far as I would know. 'Cause I--I could just--she died she was eighty-four, eighty-five. And I don't remember the date she died so I can't go backwards. But it was in the 1800s.
Speaker 1: Okay. Late 1800s.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 1890s maybe?
Speaker 2: Maybe a little bit before that. It was--I have a piece of paper that shows that my father bought the house I was born in at 559 Laurens Street in 1910 for three thousand dollars. So in 1910 she was married and so you gotta go at least fifteen or twenty years back from there.
Speaker 1: 1885 at the--.
Speaker 2: Something like that.
Speaker 1: Between 1880 and 1885.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Story_ID: 18842
Speaker 1: Can you tell me about your mother's [Sarah Clements Murphy] side of the family? How much do you know about that side of the family? How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: I had some pictures here which I really couldn't identify and right now I couldn't find. But her mother lived with us for--I remember her living with us and I don't know what we even called her. Whether we called her grandma. But she was Grandma Clements. And I don't remember what the first name was. I imagine we just called her Grandma Clements. And that was my, my mother's maiden name was Clements. And I don't remember her first name at all. And on my father's side, that was John H. Murphy Sr. Of course, he wasn't called senior until all the other John Murphys came along. But--.
Speaker 1: But, just to backtrack a second. On your mother's side--.
Speaker 2: Oh her father?
Speaker 1: How far can you go back? Can you trace--?
Speaker 2: Simultaneously) That's as far as I can go back.
Speaker 1: You don't know anything about the rest of her family going backwards or where they came from or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No I really don't. I'm trying to think who did some archival work on that. I don't think anybody in my family has done it. So her father he was in a picture we had. But I really don't know who he was. 'Cause he was dead before, before I got to the place where I recognized grandfathers.
Speaker 1: Did she talk about him?  I mean did anybody in the family talk about him?
Speaker 2: Really if they talked about him I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause he was apparently dead at the time I was born. And we weren't--we weren't an archival family. I mean we lived our life and my grandmother who lived with us. But who was before them--it's very surprising. I don't know--I've heard stories about them. I think somebody in the family was a seaman. And somebody even died at sea I think. Now that you make me think about it. And that's about all I can remember right now.
Speaker 1: So they were sea--.  A
Speaker 2: After you've gone, I'll think about some other incidents.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were at sea during the nineteenth century then, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah and I remember the fact now that they were seamen. And so that's the best I can do on that.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. Well let's see, so your--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Then my grandmother--grandfather on my mother-my father's side--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Now are we finished with your mother's side? I mean your--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) yeah. 'Cause I can't go further back.
Speaker 1: Your grandmother on your mother's side, now what about her?
Speaker 2: Was one--my grandmother, that's the one that lived with us.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that's the only, only--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Did she ever talk about growing up or--?
Speaker 1: No. I remember she was at Laurens Street. And the only thing I remember about her is when my older sister set the house on fire. I was a babe in arms, in my grandmother's arms. And she smelled smoke. Now this is something I hear from somebody else. And we find out that the toilet paper in the bathroom had been set on fire. We find out later my sister thought she could light the end and pull it out while it was burning. But it didn't work out that way. And so she couldn't do anything with it. She left the house.
Speaker 2: How old was she then when that happened?
Speaker 1: She's six years older than I was. So she was around about seven, eight. And but damage was only to the bathroom. They tell me they called the fire engines. I think we had regular fire engines then. We didn't have the horses although I remember seeing horses up on Baker Street I think. It was a fire station that had horses. But nobody was hurt. But I don't think Clementine played with matches any more.
Speaker 2: That's not a good idea.  That was my sister's name.
Story_ID: 18843
Speaker 1: How many brothers and sisters did you have?
Speaker 2: I had Clementine was the oldest. And she was six years older than I was. And Jean was four years younger than I was. And then I had a half sister Betty. Her name was Betty Dearly. That was my stepfather. Because my father [Daniel Howard Murphy] died when I was six years old. And my mother [Sarah Clements Murphy] remarried when I was about ten I think. And that's when we moved to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] to live.
Story_ID: 18844
Speaker 1: Tell me about your father's [Daniel Howard Murphy] side. How far back can you trace your father's side of the family?
Speaker 2: My father's side, I can go back to my grandfather who was John H. Murphy who was the founder of the 'Afro' ['Afro-American Newspaper']. And that happened when he was fifty years old. And the Afro was founded in 1892. So that means he was fifty years old at that time. And he lived until 1926. And my father died first. And he died around two or three months after that in 1926.
Speaker 1: So your grandfather who was the founder was about around 1842--42 I guess?
Speaker 2: Well he was born, let's see, he was fifty years old in 1892. So we go back fifty more years from there is when he was born. And that makes that's '40 [1840] something.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's 1842.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So he was born in 1842.
Speaker 2: That's right. Right.
Speaker 1: Now is he the one that served in the Civil War?
Speaker 2: That's right. And there's a book I looked for before you came here that I have that's called 'Sergeant Murphy'. And I think Carl Murphy wrote the book. It's a pamphlet and it tells about him being an officer in the [U.S.] Army, Civil War. And I don't have that documented very well. But that's something you'd hear by mouth.
Speaker 1: Right. I've heard other family members talk about that.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That he was a sergeant in the Civil War.
Speaker 2: That's right. You may know more about him than I do right now (laughing).
Speaker 1: Do you know the regimen he served in or?  No I don't.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That might have been in the book that I have or pamphlet that I have called 'Sergeant Murphy'.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. And he's the founder of the 'Afro-American'.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And he founded it when he was fifty years old in 1892.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so your family has been in the newspaper business ever since.
Speaker 2: That's right. In this--If he's the first generation, at the present time we have the fourth generation running the paper. And we have members of the fifth generation who are on the board of directors. So it's very unusual in any business, white or black, stays together for five generations. And we use the expression, "We've never missed an edition and never missed a payroll."
Speaker 1: The second part--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Sometimes the payroll was a little low but we never missed it.
Speaker 1: Yeah if you missed the second part, you're not gonna get the first part.  (Laughs)
Speaker 2: That's right. Absolutely.
Speaker 1: All right. So what else can you tell me about your father's side of the family? Any stories about your grandfather that they talk about?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Grandpop, I was fairly close to him. I mean I was just a little toddler at that time. I know he took me to church once down to--his church was Bethel church. And Bishop Samson Brooks I think was the-was the--not the pastor, he was the bishop of the church. I don't know who the pastor was. But it was--I don't know whether you say it was a typical Baptist church or not. But people were not bashful about speaking out to the Lord or whoever it might be. And I do remember  the time he took me down there it kind of frightened me. And I only went there once. And I didn't go back to Bethel until recently. I was here in Baltimore [Maryland] working then as an adult.  But--.
Speaker 1: Somebody made a joyful noise.
Speaker 2: (Laughing) That's right. Made a joyful noise unto the Lord. And there was plenty of acrobatics and those kinds of things. But that was par for the course. But he lived on--lived on McCulloh Street. And I remember the house very well 'cause it was one of the few houses in that block had four steps to go up from the sidewalk and he had a beautiful brass railing. And I've been there two or three times. 'Cause he lived right around the corner from where we lived [559 Laurens Street]. He was only around about three blocks away. And the thing I liked most of all and I don't know the name of the thing. I think I even have one year now. The thing you put in--you put a card in that has two pictures on it. And then look through it and you see one picture in three dimensions.
Speaker 1: Yes. It's called a--.
Speaker 2: Oh goodness.
Speaker 1: Our videographer [Scott Stearns] might know--,
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --if he's with us here.
Speaker 2: Yeah stereo something.
Speaker 1: 'Cause all the older families had that that. Like we had slide projectors. And I think I have one on the bottom shelf of this--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes, a device that holds two cards. And you look through--,
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Right in here. Yeah, look through the card.
Speaker 2: --eyepieces.
Speaker 1: And you see the three dimensional thing.
Speaker 2: Stereo something.
Speaker 1: Yeah we had a stack of cards.  And I used to go around there and just spend time looking at that. I remember that more than anything else. And Grandpoppa was pretty bowlegged. I remember that. And he was--I don't guess he was much taller than I was. Not as I was then, but I am now. He wasn't a tall person. And apparently as far as I'm concerned he was pretty loveable. I never remember him scolding me or whipping me or anything like that. I was a fairly well behaved boy. Not perfect. But I liked Grandpop. He was all right. Yeah, but he died I was ten year-six years old. 'Cause he died right at the same time my father died. The same year.  So I was six years old. There's not too many things I would remember other than the fact that he was likeable. He took me to church. I don't remember seeing him at the 'Afro' working at any time. Because at that time at six years old I don't think I went to the 'Afro' at that time.
Story_ID: 18845
Speaker 1: Your father [Daniel Howard Murphy] and your grandfather [John H. Murphy Sr.] died around the same time [1922]?
Speaker 2: They died around the same time.
Speaker 1: Did they die in an--.
Speaker 2: 'Cause he was--my father--we never knew--our family never knew exactly what his problem was. I think it was lead poisoning. Because he worked at in our ['Afro-American Newspaper'] composing room. And he was the supervisor in the composing room dealing with type all the time. And Jack Fortune, I heard you talking to [wife] Camay [Murphy] about him--said, my father would just put--type fall on the floor. He'd pick it up and put it somewhere. He'd put his hands in his mouth or whatever.  And I think that that contact with the type caused him to--that was I think one of the problems in his death. But he had been to Florida. He'd been to Florida a couple of times before he died, for his health.
Speaker 1: Did he have relatives in Florida?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) And he died in Florida.
Speaker 1: Did he have relatives in Florida?
Speaker 2: No, he just went there as a--maybe he was asthmatic. I don't know why but he went there for his health. That's what the story is. And he had been there two different times. I remember that. But he died in Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then he came back. Those were the days when you had the coffin in the parlor. And I remember the coffin being in the parlor. I didn't go to the funeral. But, I mean go to the cemetery 'cause that I think somewhere in--it wasn't in Baltimore [Maryland]. I really don't know where. No, no, he was buried in Baltimore 'cause he was down to Mount Auburn Cemetery.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Mm-hm. Now can you tell me--.
Speaker 2: It was my mother [Sarah Clements Murphy] that was out of town.
Speaker 1: Okay. And you were about ten years old you said?
Speaker 2: No when father died I was six years old.
Speaker 1: Six.  yeah.
Speaker 2: When your grandfather died that was--?
Speaker 1: I was still six.
Speaker 2: Same year.
Speaker 1: Still six. I was born in March [1916] and they died after I was six years old.
Speaker 2: Now tell us about your father and how did he come to die so young?
Speaker 1: Well I think it was--he had been rather sickly. And he was never really from the stories I hear a really healthy person that would go out and ran track or something like that. But the thing I remember about him most of all when I was four years old, he took me out to Brazil, Indiana.  'Cause his sister Rose Murphy married Dr. Oliver. And they lived in Brazil, Indiana. And he went up there on several occasions. And I went with him when I was about four. And I remember the house and flowers around the house. But most of all I remember riding in the--or sleeping in the upper what do you call it? In a Pullman car. In the upper--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Upper berth.
Speaker 1: Upper berth. And he slept below. And they treated us very well on the train. And apparently it took--either was a night rode. It didn't take twenty-four hours to get there. But part of it was sleeping on the train. So apparently we must have gotten on in the evening and rode through the night. And that's almost to Chicago [Illinois], Brazil, Indiana. You had to go just a little bit further and you're in Chicago. And I know my daughter used to go to visit friends out in Chicago. And that was an overnight on the Chicago Limited, I think. You get on around 7:00 at night and you get to Chicago around 7:00 in the morning. They may have cut that time down a little now.
Speaker 2: Right. They can yeah. Now tell me it was about ten hours driving if you drove it. It would be about ten hours right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course in those days--well no. They--not everybody. But my father never had a car I don't think. 'Cause I don't remember riding with him. But my--on my mother's side Nixons. The was violent--Violet Clements. But she married John Nixon. And they lived up on Druid Hill Avenue and they had a car.
Speaker 2: Those are your mother's parents?
Speaker 1: My mother's sister.
Speaker 2: Sister. Okay sister.
Speaker 1: Had married John--John Nixon.
Speaker 2: Nixon.  and--.
Speaker 1: Just before we leave your father.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So your father grew up her in Baltimore and he--did he run the paper when he was--?
Speaker 2: No, he was in the mechanical department. And I just read a letter looking for some of the things I was looking for, for this interview, that my father had sent my grandfather 'cause he started the letter off with Dad and told him how he was doing. And he was going to Linotype school. Now this was not in--this was out West. How far west, I don't know. Not--either in Ohio or somewhere in that area. He went to learn how to use the Linotype machine because at that point we were just buying, the 'Afro' ['Afro-American Newspaper'] was just buying a new Linotype machine. We didn't--prior to that it was handset type. And he had gone out there to learn how to use it. And in one of the letters--if you gave me another twelve hours, I could find it again. He--his letter was in long hand but he did some other part of the letter on a Linotype machine. And he had several errors on the Linotype machine. That was his first sample of doing Linotype work. Because when he came back, the idea was he was gonna be in charge of the accounts department. But I don't think that ever came to pass because all these things happened most likely around 1912.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) '22 [1922].
Speaker 2: It was before I was born.
Speaker 1: Oh 1912.
Speaker 2: Yeah, about that time. Because 1916--yeah. About that time. 'Cause I was only six years old when he died. So around 1920. So it could have been a couple of years before that he went out to learn how to use the Linotype machine.
Speaker 1: So he died around 1922?  1926.
Speaker 2: '26 [1926]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay. So you were a little older then I guess.
Speaker 1: In '26 I'd be ten years old wouldn't I?  No. He died before that so about '21 [1921].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: See going back on these years they all flow into one another.
Speaker 2: Yeah. If you were six--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Well I know I was six years old.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it would be around '22 [1922].
Speaker 1: '22, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so I mean Grandpop died about the same time.
Story_ID: 18846
Speaker 1: Can you tell me about growing up? What were some of the sights, and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well growing up, I always enjoyed my childhood all the way through from six years old--I guess childhood lasts around about 'til you're sixteen. But in Baltimore [Maryland] we first lived on Laurens Street--559 Laurens Street.  Which was about a half a block from the Lafayette Market. And I don't remember too much about what I did in terms of playing around and all those kind of things. Because we moved to Laurens Street to three blocks away to Druid Hill Avenue. To both--on Laurens it was a three- story house. And we moved to Druid Hill Avenue. That was also a three-story house but a much bigger house. And at that time [sister] Clementine had been born. Clementine was the oldest. I was here in four years. When we moved to Druid Hill Avenue, there were three children in the family. And so I did a lot of playing on Druid Hill Avenue. Next door--and the thing--the interesting thing about the neighbors that all kind of culture and economics of the families were all mixed in--were all mixed up. Two doors from me was Dr. Cadoza (ph.). Next door I remember William was a guy I played with all the time. And then we had the principal of--[Ashbie] Hawkins who was the principal of [Frederick] Douglass High [School, Baltimore, Maryland]. He lived two block--two doors above us. And then on the corner was another doctor. I forgot his name right now. So we had a good mix in the neighborhood. And my playmates across the street, Woods--Woods. Davis and John Wood. But anyway around about four or five playmates that I played with all the time. And I remember Mama [Sarah Clements Murphy] kept--we had roomers, R-O-O-M-E-R-S--.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Living up on our third floor.
Speaker 1: A lot of people had roomers in those days right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: If you had a place--.
Speaker 2: That big.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And I remember all the names. These were all teachers at Douglass High. And Dot Craft, Delma Garland, Irene Tray--Trig and Ruth Demond. They were the girls that lived in the house. And they really liked me, as a teacher would like, you know, a kid. And they usually gave me presents that little things like that. And--but that was the way most of my life was. The-I don't remember if I sold papers or not. I don't think I did.
Story_ID: 18847
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about school. Where did you go to school? And were you a good student when you were a little kid, or--?
Speaker 2: According to my marks I was pretty good. I didn't know I was good. But I studied my lessons and evidently passed all my things. And my report cards were usually in the nineties. But the amazing thing was I stayed in Baltimore [Maryland] until fifth grade. And I went to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] when my mother [Sarah Clements Murphy] remarried, married after my father [Daniel Howard Murphy] died. William Nearly (ph.) and we went to Philadelphia. And that was in the sixth grade. And my marks came from ninety down to--I did well to stay in the seventies. I don't think I ever went down to sixties. But I was in the seventies for about the next two or three years. Because after I went there in the sixth grade, I was a good student. I went there and very seldom sick. And (unclear) pretty good. Not excellent. But the curriculum was just either further ahead. 'Cause these--Philadelphia schools, of course, were integrated there which was not true in Baltimore. And it's like missing a couple grades. Or at least missing a grade. And I had to catch up on the things I missed. So I was really struggling. And I really didn't catch up until I was round about--see you go in junior high in seventh grade, eighth grade. By the time I got to eighth grade, I was on a par with everybody else. But I was two years younger than practically everybody in my class because number one I started school when I was five years old. And then somewhere around the second or third grade I got skipped. And so instead of graduating from high school at eighteen where most people graduated, I graduated at sixteen. So I really was kind of left out of most of the social life. Because two years at that point in your life was--is like ten years later on. So--and I was short. I didn't start growing 'til I went to college. I was the shortest person in my graduating class from junior high, and the shortest person from senior high. And from first year of college to the fourth year, I grew around six or seven inches. So I did all my growing at that time. But I was growing physically. But I still was behind in being an adult. So I was kind of left out. Of course, when I went to Temple University [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] I really was with the--we only had about 1to 2 percent black at Temple University. So we were a kind of close-knit group.
Speaker 1: Okay. I just wanna ask you going back to Philadelphia. Now you attended what high school in Philadelphia?
Speaker 2: High school was Overbrook High [School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Overbrook. Now that's the famous high school--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) That's where [professional basketball player] Wilt Chamberlain went.
Speaker 1: 'The dipper'. Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's right (laughing).
Speaker 1: Dr. R. Thomas went there, and several other people.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a famous high  school.  By the time I was there, my class was only 2 percent black.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then before that I was in what the name? Shoemaker [Junior High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] was the junior high. Both of those were new schools when I started going to them.
Speaker 2: Okay. Now did you have any teacher in--at the grade school level or in-at the high school level that were mentors to you? People that took a special interest in you that you remember?
Speaker 1: Well in Baltimore [Maryland] I only remember one teacher. And he was pretty strict. And I got cracked on the knuckles a couple of times. And his name I think was Mr. Boston. But I'm not positive. But I did well in Baltimore. And we went to Philadelphia. A teacher in Brook School which was one block from where I lived, my teacher lived three doors from where I lived, on 57th Street. And she knew that I sold newspapers at that time. 'Cause as soon as I went to Philadelphia--not as soon as. But as soon as I was able to sell papers, I was selling Afros ['Afro-American Newspaper'] and Tribune ['The Philadelphia Tribune'], Independent ['The Philadelphia Independent']. And when somebody had done something wrong in the class, often times, it was a habit I guess all teachers keep you after school. But she knew I sold papers. So she always let me go. So they always called me the teacher's pet. But she was just taking care of my financial interests 'cause she knew I had a job to do. But I got along well-I always got along well with teachers. 'Cause I figured the teachers are the one that give you the marks. No point in getting on their wrong side. And where I didn't know, I tried. And I know, of course, one incident much later on in school in one course I flunked in college in Napoleonic history. And I was called on to--I never said I didn't know. I'd always ay something. And I got up and talked. And the teacher finally stopped me and said, "Mr. Murphy, when you stood up I thought you really knew what you were talking about. But the more you go (laughing) the less I know you know about the subject." But I always tell kids, "Don't ever say you don't know. Say something." And it just may come back to you and may be the right answer. But even when I was teaching Sunday School and things like that I said--somebody call on. "Well don't say I don't know. Think. And then give an answer." It might be wrong. But the teacher knows you're thinking. So I wanna be on the right side of the teacher. 'Cause that's who's gonna move you ahead.
Speaker 2: Now who else? Were any high school teachers that you remember?
Speaker 1: The only one I know by name is Mr. Ruth. But all the teachers that I had were-I was usually in my class I was usually the only black in that class. Sometimes--I never had more than two other blacks in the class with me. Because we changed rooms for the different subjects. But most of my teachers liked me and I liked them. I didn't have anybody say the teacher don't like. That's why I got a bad mark. If I got a bad mark, I was a poor student. And I--but I enjoyed school. I wanted to go to school.
Speaker 2: Now you were at--when you--I know you were younger than the other students--,
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --but were you involved in other activities on campus like playing sports or do anything like that?
Speaker 1: In--.
Speaker 2: Class office or--?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Let's see in Overbrook we played like--during lunch time we'd play football. Our playground was on the roof of the school. And we'd take a lunch bags and put it together and put a rubber band around it and play ball with it. And most of my athletics--I probably was involved with a lot of athletics, but it was neighborhood kids. And we had football teams, baseball teams. Sometime I was--since I always had the ball and bat, I would be the captain or whatever. And when they chose sides--I don't know how you chose it but you choose sides you put the bat up I was usually about the third person chosen. I was never the last person. 'Cause I was--I was pretty good. I was--I could run fast. Because sometime I had a habit mainly of cussing people out, which I got rid of that early. But I couldn't fight. And so they started chasing me. One of the best things to do was to run around cars. And when you run around cars it's hard to catch you. And by the time they caught me they were just--they'd say ain't no point in beating this brother up (laughing). And let it go at that.
Speaker 2: They were too tired.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I got in very few fights.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I got in one fight in junior high school--in senior high school. That the class was being held in for something somebody had done. And I finally told who did it. And, "All right. I'll see you after class." And so by the time we got out of school all the people in that class rounded up. We were in the middle. We started to fight. And he hit me in the nose and my nose started bleeding. That was the end of the fight. He won (laughing).
Speaker 2: There was nothing else done--.
Speaker 1: (Laughing) That was the end of the fight. But I didn't get in many fights. 'Cause I could usually run away and cuss you out a little bit and run. But I enjoyed going to school. Very seldom absent. And imagine if I checked, I don't think I was absent more than four or five times going through high school and junior high school. One suspension for blowing beans in a bean blower. Teacher wasn't in the room. And so we were just cuttin' up. But it so happened that the minute she opened the door, one of my beans was flying across the room. So, I got suspended with a friend of mine. And we walked around. We were scared to death. Every time we saw a cop, we would go the other way or go the opposite way or turn around. 'Cause you know the cop would be stopping school kids that were out during school time. And I believe the next morning I didn't tell my mother [Sarah Clements Murphy] 'til the next morning. "Ma,  they want you to give me a note, 'cause I did something wrong in class." "Well why didn't you tell me last night?" "I forgot." And so she give me a note and I went on back to class. And everything was all right. But I enjoyed school. Never a brilliant person. But finally I guess by the time I graduated from Temple I was around about in the top 20 percent of my class anyway.

Speaker 1: How did you choose to go to Temple [University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Well my sister Clementine went up in Philly--it was during the [Great] Depression number one. And Clem was going to the University of Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]. And the tuition there was about three times as much as it was at Temple. So when it came time for me to go, I was supposed to go to Drexel [University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]. Because they wanted me to be in the ['Afro-American Newspaper'] Mechanical Department when I graduated from college. But Drexel didn't take blacks. And their reason--their rationale was that at Drexel you spent two thirds of the year in school and one- third in industry. And their claim was--and they may have been right at that time, where they wanted to place you in business, the only blacks there was janitors and that kind of level of employment. But to learn the things that they wanted me to learn, you weren't--you didn't fit there yet. So my next selection was Temple. So I went into business administration. Which in the long run ended up better for me than going in the mechanical department. But I believe the tuition was something like two and a quarter [$225] and the university fee was $75. So for a whole year it was $300 you're talking about. I don't know whether that was for a semester or for--it must have been a semester. So that's $600 you--takes care of a whole year. So we could afford that.

Speaker 1: Dad--that's Mr. Nearly (ph.) was in the catering business. And when I first went to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], he was the headwaiter of a hotel--of a restaurant over in Camden, New Jersey, which was right across the river. But as time went on, the [Great] Depression came, they let him go. And he started a catering business. And he did pretty well in the catering business. In fact, he did very well in the catering business. And so got plenty of ice cream, lots of crusts of bread when they'd made the sandwiches for the white folks. But I grew up--I was a very, very happy, contented person. Didn't start dating 'til I was round about sixteen, something like that. 'Cause my interest was going over to the park and playing baseball or football or whatever. Got a car when I was sixteen. Cost me twenty-five dollars.
Speaker 2: The car, really?
Speaker 1: It was an old Oakland.  I don't--they don't make them now. It was either an Oakland or an Overland. They made both of those cars.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And kept that for a year. And it caught on fire somewhere.
Speaker 2: What year was it--was the car?
Speaker 1: '24 [1924]. '24 or '25 [1925].
Speaker 2: Okay. A '24 Oakland.
Speaker 1: Yeah. It was my brother-in-law sold it to me. And then when that caught on fire, he had bought another car. And he sold that to me for fifty dollars (laughing). So I've had transportation--I've been driving since I've been sixteen years old. And all of it was my money. 'Cause I had a newspaper route, magazine route, Cromwell Publishing Company. Took--I had two customers I took to church on Sunday and also sold ice. So I was doing pretty well. I was making round about fifteen, sixteen dollars a week. And so when it came time for me to come to Baltimore [Maryland], my first job was paying me the same as I was making up in Philadelphia.  I was--paid eighteen dollars a week. And I was making more than that in Philadelphia. Almost--being my own boss.
Story_ID: 18850
Speaker 1: I came to Baltimore [Maryland] and stayed there. And my uncle asked me, "Well where would you like to go? We [Afro-American Newspapers] have openings in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and we have openings in Washington [D.C.]." And so I--since I knew all the people in Philadelphia, my girlfriend was up in Philadelphia, I said, "I'll take Philadelphia." (laughing) "No, I need you in Washington more." So he sent me over to Washington and gave me a two-dollar raise. So my first job when I really had to do some work was twenty dollars a week. And that's where I met my--you will see his picture somewhere down the road--my best friend came from Woburn, Massachusetts.  And he was the 'Afro' ['Afro-American Newspaper'] photographer. And we roomed together. And so that twenty dollars a week I had--we had a single room in a--right near a campus where ten, ten rooms were in the house. And our room was eighteen dollars--seventeen dollars--eight fifty [$8.50] a piece.  And we ate to--what we called the greasy spoon. But that was Miss Overton's. We had two meals every day seven days a week twenty-five dollars a month. So we always had extra money. 'Cause see that took care of our your basic stuff. Your board and your eating. And I always had a car. So I took people places in the car. So I always had some money in my pocket. Not much. But had money. And so that bring me down to Washington where I started working really for the 'Afro'.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  Working hard.
Speaker 1: Where you--you started in the mailroom you said, right? Or did you--?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Oh at that point that's after college?
Speaker 2: Over in Washington I was really the officer manager. We had a--my--I was in charge of the business end.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The manager of that part of it.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Okay. But way back before you worked in the mailroom, right?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't work in the mailroom at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause in Baltimore, I was too young to work then. So in Philadelphia where I grew up--so when I left Philadelphia I was just eighteen years old when I came to Baltimore. So when I started working, I was eighteen--yeah. I graduated eighteen. I came to Baltimore and worked here around about four or five months--two or three months. Really just doing gofer work for eighteen dollars. And then went to Washington and left here in 19---not nineteen. Eighteen years old.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, eighteen years old. That's 1934.
Speaker 2: In 1937.
Speaker 1: '37?  '37.
Speaker 2: You were older than that then.  In '37?
Speaker 1: Yeah. I mean in--yeah, you're older than eighteen. 'Cause you--it took you four years to get out of--.
Speaker 2: [Overbrook] High school [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Well--.
Speaker 2: College.
Speaker 1: College. Right. From Temple [University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]. So if you started off when you were sixteen--,  (Simultaneously) That's right.
Speaker 2: --you got out in 1920--I mean '32 [1932]. Right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, '33 [1933].  I was graduating from college was '33.
Speaker 2: Yeah, '33.  So how old was I in '33?
Speaker 1: '33, you would have been--.
Speaker 2: That's pen and pencil there.
Speaker 1: No, you would have been seventeen.
Speaker 2: Eighteen.
Speaker 1: I started working at eighteen.
Speaker 2: Yeah, eighteen.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's when I started working over in Washington. 'Cause when you get to be eighty-something all those years back there just role into one big clump of years. 'Cause very seldom do you remember what year these things happened unless we go back like we did then and just subtract and add.
Speaker 2: I think we still got it wrong.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: If you were--.
Speaker 1: How old was I in '37 [1937] when I graduated from Temple? I remember that.
Speaker 2: Okay. So then you were--you were twenty.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You were twenty years old when you came out of Temple.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: All right. So you were manager of the Washington Bureau?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Just the--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Office?
Speaker 1: Really the office boss. Because the manager of the office was my cousin George B. Murphy and Ralph Matthews. And, of course, the head of the advertisement department was Joan Acore (ph.) who was the advertising manager. And so we were doing very well over there. But I was more interested in circulation than anything else. 'Cause I was more associated with (unclear) about in Washington alone, we had about five hundred newsboys. Which was comparable to what they had in Baltimore. So at that time we were really making money. I mean as far as--we were doing well. And our--'cause our circulation-total circulation there was about 130,000 papers.  'Cause we had about six, seven editions. We had Baltimore, Washington, Richmond [Virginia], New Jersey, Newark in New Jersey and for a little while we had an office in New York.  But that only lasted a couple of years. And then we had a North Carolina edition, a South Carolina edition and another edition which was called national. And the idea was that we had this press that we had bought from the 'Chicago Tribune'. And it was a thirty-two-page press. And just to put out a Baltimore paper your press would be idle three days a week. 'Cause you put out a paper in Baltimore on Tuesday and Friday. So then we started in Washington. That was just a little bit before I came there. The paper had just started around two years before then. We only had one paper in Washington. A paper in Philadelphia, a paper in Jersey and the national paper. So we had the press running five days a week. So we got our money's worth out the press.
Speaker 2: Okay. What were the other challenges of running the paper?
Speaker 1: Well personnel. I was in charge of most of the secretarial help. I had the most in hiring in those particular areas. But my main job was watching the money. Although we had a bookkeeper, Mr. Moreman (ph.). I remember his name. 'Cause he was hard of hearing. And a lot of times we got in arguments. And we'd cuss him out or something or he'd cuss us out and turn the machine off (laughing) and he couldn't hear what we were saying. But he was a nice guy. But we had--we ran a tight ship in terms of money. I think we had the best organized--organization in our circulation department. Our papers came over to us on Thursday. And the boys that sold newspaper, there were five hundred of them.  They had substations. But they paid for their papers before they got them. In other words, they would come with the money and pay for the papers in advance. And they went out and sold them. And then at the end of the day, they took their profit out of the money. So they would be first in line to get their papers to go out next Thursday. They paid for their paper on either Friday or Saturday of the week that they sold them. And so we had their money in the until Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. They came back, they had a slip. We gave them a slip. So they came back with just a slip. And we gave the papers out according to the numbers on the slip. Whoever was in line. And the first guys that got the papers were the first ones who went out hollering "Afro". 'Cause they sold them on the street and the corners. And so our organization in Washington was better than any of the rest of them. 'Cause the rest of them gave the boys papers on consignment. And then they collected on a Saturday. But a lot of times, before they got there on Saturday, Mom had the money or Dad has the money or--there were problems in collection. The boys would collect the money and give it to their mother. Then you come on Saturday, mother had to buy something at the store. So you got a little balance. So you don't have your little balance. The next week it's a little higher. So the collection problems in Baltimore was much worse than the collection problem in Washington. We had no collection problem. So I enjoyed that. I enjoyed working with the kids. And while we were waiting for the paper, they were shipped over from Baltimore by truck. And they--we tried to get them over there about 4:00 or 5:00. but sometimes it might be later. Even sometimes dark. So we tried to entertain the boys. We had a ping pong table out there and we just had fun with them. And we had some boxing gloves. I know I started boxing with the kids once. I'm about-what am I, twenty, twenty-one. Still--I still hadn't grown to the 5' 9" that I finally was. And a few of the kids twelve, fourteen, sixteen. I'm up here boxing. One boy hit me in the face so badly. I said, (laughing) "That's the end of that. We'll play ping-pong."
Speaker 2: Where did you box? You boxed right there in the paper?
Speaker 1: Right out there on the street.
Speaker 2: Oh okay.  'Cause we had the driveway for the car-for the trucks to come in. We may be up in that little area where you park. Just like out here where you park your car. We'd be up there playing. And we might go--next--two doors down was an alley. And we'd go up there and play ball. Throw balls back and forth.
Story_ID: 18851
Speaker 1: Which edition of the 'Afro-American' circulated nationally? 'Cause you had a national--.
Speaker 2: We had a national edition. It just went to all of the places outside of the ones that I named. Because we sold papers in practically every state. In subscriptions mainly. But in Boston [Massachusetts] we had a guy named Mr. Freeman I think. And he sold about three thousand papers. And I remember Warner was a guy in Charlotte--Virginia--Charlotte--Charleston. Not Charleston. What's the big city in North Carolina?
Speaker 1: Charlotte.
Speaker 2: Charlotte. And I went down to visit him after I became associated with the Baltimore [Maryland] 'Afro' [Afro-American Newspaper]. He sold about three thousand to five thousand papers. And our total circulation was running around about 130,000 to 150,000 every week. So we were the second largest paper in circulation. The 'Pittsburgh Courier' were selling more than we were up until--we finally passed them. But their biggest circulation was in Florida. And--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) What about the 'Defender' ['Chicago Defender']?
Speaker 2: The 'Defender' was--no they weren't--the 'Defender' was the second daily paper, the 'Chicago Defender'. And John Sengstacke had that paper. But their circulation was behind--maybe third or fourth. But they were a daily paper which made them have a little more prestige. They had a daily paper. And then they started a weekend paper. But their weekend paper was nowhere near what our papers were.
Story_ID: 18852
Speaker 1: We were discussing off camera some of the problems with trying to keep track of the employees and the money and that sort of thing.  Yeah. That's one that's--.
Speaker 2: You were taught not to really trust anybody, right?  Yeah. I mean they're your employees. It might be family. It might be anybody else. But you put up a--put a system down that's relatively foolproof. And when something goes wrong, you look at everybody. And as I said, this one brother was cashing--checked the mail before the bookkeeper checked the mail. And checks, he just put on an account. And it came up to about three thousand dollars over a period of about a couple of months I think before we caught up with him. And he had deposited checks in his account. And of course, we didn't lose anything on that 'cause the bank had to pay all that back. So we got all that back from the bank because that was the cashier's responsibility. He couldn't be taking an Afro [Afro-American Newspapers] check and putting it in his account.
Speaker 1: Right.  So but we tried to keep a tight reign on--not only on--not only on your cash, but on your employees. And they all--I believe the employees make your business. And if you can keep your employees happy, and that's really one thing I give myself some credit too. That during the time that I was with the Afro, we hardly ever lost any employees going--to leave this job to go to some other job. Although practically everybody who worked for the Afro was competent enough to get another job somewhere else.  Even with a white company or whatever paying more money. When integration came, they could have gone to the ['Washington] Post' or gone to the ['Baltimore] Sun'--which some did. But some didn't. And--because they wanted to work with the Afro a--we made it pleasant for them to work. And so we kept--I think we had more twenty-year employees than any normal business would have. We gave awards for five, ten, twenty years. In twenty years everybody wanted to get that watch. But it was really a good team that we developed. Not by being lax, but by being fair. And that was one thing that employees make your company. As long as the people at the top--as you read in the paper now the people at the top often times they're the ones that are stealing the money or doing tricks with the money. But we were all fair with everybody 'cause we didn't have much money to go around. But during my administration and also [uncle] Carl's [Carl Murphy] too. Because we never missed an edition. Never missed a payroll. And during the twenty-five years that I was either president or chairman of the board, we never let anybody go because we were cutting back to save money.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: A couple of times we got kind of tight.  And we talked to the employees and said, "We could either let two or three people go or all of us could take--I believe all of us took our vacation one year and didn't take vacation. And--it was unpaid vacation. And so everybody had--,
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Just took time off.
Speaker 1: --two weeks or three weeks or whatever it was. We got money from unemployment compensation. And some people just took a day a week for eight weeks or whatever it was. So they would have long weekends every week. So it worked out. So we pulled through it. That was the end of it. Went on back and gave you your days back. And we went on from there.
Story_ID: 18853
Speaker 1: Tell me about some of your better reporters at the 'Afro' ['Afro-American Newspaper']. Can you remember photographers and reporters or editors that were--?  (Simultaneously) Well our photographer was the person I told you I roomed with when I first went to Washington [D.C.]. That was William Scott. And he was the best friend I ever had. And I have a little thing here I want you to read when we finish that you can put somewhere in the report. He didn't have a car for--of course, a lot of people didn't have cars then but he never missed an assignment the whole time he was with the 'Afro'. He did bus, walked, whatever. 'Cause you're from-what do you do in Washington now?
Speaker 2: We're just doing interviews.  You're just doing interviews. I mean you're not-haven't been living there.
Speaker 1: No.  Yeah. And it never dawned on me to--since I always drove that this guy would be covering assignments all over Washington. And if he had to be there at 6:00 or 8:00 or whatever time, he's there. And you got your pictures. And so he's the one photographer that I know in Washington.  But in Baltimore [Maryland] we had, oh goodness. I can't think of his name right now. But Phillips, Frank Phillips was one of our early photographers. And he married the--[uncle] Carl Murphy's daughter. Betty Morris--She was Betty Murphy (laughing) and since she became Betty Phillips [Elizabeth Murphy Phillips Moss].
Story_ID: 18854
Speaker 1: We had a system of paying. We had three top people that [uncle] Carl [Murphy]--he needed at least three people to run the business [Afro-American Newspapers]. And all three of us during my whole administration the twenty-five years I was the president or chairman of the board. All three of us got the same salary. That was the president, the vice president John Oliver most of the time and Betty Morris was in charge of the editorial department. And we never figured--or I never really figured why Carl called me upstairs somewhere when I was in the '60s [1960s]. That--really in the '50s [1950s]. Because I was made acting president in late 1961. And called me us and said that--would I consider being the president of the Afro [Afro-American Newspapers]. And--'cause Howard Murphy was over--I worked under Howard. And in my mind, Howard was gonna be the president. I mean just--that's the way you worked. And so I asked him about Howard. He said, "No, I think you're younger. And if he becomes president, you'll have to change again in a shorter period of time." He gave me a logical reason. So I didn't feel badly. And Howard just worked with me the whole time I was there. He was a business manager and the oldest one of my cousins that worked for the paper. But we worked--we were best friends. And he helped me and I helped him. And so that worked out perfectly. But I was curious about his daughter. Because he tried five times to have a son but all of them came out girls. So he just--he knew I thought more about money the same way he did. That just because you got it, you don't spend it. And he always believed in paying cash for stuff which now a days nobody does. But all the big equipment we had in the paper--even the press that we bought from the Chicago paper. It--we didn't go to a bank for a loan. I believe we had a note with the 'Chicago Tribune' to pay them for the press. And the only thing that we went in mortgage for was buildings. And at the time I left the paper, we owned the Baltimore [Maryland] building with no mortgage on it--no mortgage on any of the buildings.  The Baltimore building, the Washington [D.C.] building, the Richmond [Virginia] building and the other place I believe we rented in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]. But he was a believer in not building up any debt through mortgages and note. And they didn't have credit cards I think in those days either. I mean the plastic credit cards. You may have a credit thing in a department stores. But those--you used a little metal thing that you had. But credit cards--I don't' think credit cards started. You know, the typical Visa and all those cards.
Speaker 2: This is the mid '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Yeah, late '60s  Yeah. But I watched the money and he watched the money. And he was even more frugal than I was. That--while I was the purchase manager, a couple of times, he wanted to just go to the office and look in people's desks and see all these paperclips in the desk. He'd take some up and put them in a little box or something.  And I'd come up to him maybe at the end of the month and say, "Oh we gotta order some paperclips."  "Who wants them? Here they are." I mean he was just--he would go through our composing room . See that thing on the wall right over my head? That's type. And those things cost about either twenty-five to a dollar apiece depending on the size of the type you're gonna use. And it comes off a Linotype machine. And the reason I was able to get them, because when you went to hot type, all that became antiquated. And so I used them for artwork and little things like that. And but he would go back in the composing room where we had the linotype machine and see one of them laying on the floor. Say, "Would you leave twenty-five cents laying on the floor like that?" "No, Mr. Carl."  "All right. Pick it up." Laying on the floor, the guy comes by--the janitor comes buy, he sweeps everything up. Throws it away and you gotta order new ones. Usually they get damaged in wear. But you need those to make--set your type so that you can print your paper. But he's that kind of guy. They called him 'the breeze'. He'd walk around, you did know he was there. He'd say, "When everybody's hugging the phone, he knows he's not talking business." So he would, "Business call?" "Oh Mr. Carl." (laughing) So you got used to that kind of treatment. And you don't try to hustle him. And--but he's always been--everybody who's worked for him--he's strict, but he's fair. And I tried to use that same philosophy. That--I really never--I never personally fired anybody. But I had heads of departments. I believed in having a head of a department that runs the department. And I hired Ken Wilson from the 'Chicago Defender'. And he became a lifesaver to the 'Afro'. And he was just great. And I know I went over to the hospital to see him lately. I really felt just so depressed 'cause we are one year apart in age. And he just--he's going down hill fast. But he's still around. I told him I'll come back. But I gotta get myself together to go back. He's the one that owns the marina here in Baltimore. Down in the harbor. That through politics he got that. And what else did he have? A couple of apartment houses up--up on Madison Avenue. He's a good financier and takes care of his money and he's done well.
Story_ID: 18855
Speaker 1: Did you help decide editorial policy for the paper ['Afro-American Newspaper']?
Speaker 2: The only time that I may be involved in that is when it came time--we had a committee and I was on that committee. In which we endorsed politicians. We always did--the one time that we didn't endorse a politician--I don't know whether you remember [U.S.] Vice President [Spiro] Agnew. You remember that name?
Speaker 1: Yeah, right. Spiro Agnew.  Spiro Agnew.
Speaker 2: He used to be--he used to be the governor of Maryland.  Yeah, the governor of Maryland.
Speaker 1: Right.  In my judgment  he became the governor of Maryland--he ran against two powerful Democrats, Stills and somebody else. I don't know--both of the names began with an S [sic, the candidates running against Agnew in Maryland's 1966 governor's race were George P. Mahoney and Hyman A. Pressman]. And both of them were good friends of the 'Afro', and he was running as a single Republican. And at that time, we were about at the place in our newspaper life and we had more readership than any other time. And we didn't endorse either one. The only time that I remember we didn't endorse a candidate. And we just said that they were both good guys and vote for whomever you want. And the vote came out almost equal with the two of them. And the two of their votes combined were much more than Agnew. But individually they weren't. You follow me? And Agnew won the election. Because in my judgment if we had endorsed one or the other, they would have gotten enough votes to have been the governor at that time.
Speaker 2: Now going back a ways to 1932. Was the 'Afro-American' a republican paper basically in the beginning? Like most black people?  In '32, that was before my time.
Speaker 1: That's when FDR [Franklin D. Roosevelt] ran [for U.S. President].  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Did the 'Afro'--do you know if the 'Afro'--.  (simultaneously) I think-I think we supported FDR.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm almost sure. 'Cause I don't remember when we didn't support a democratic person. Now we may have earlier on. But from 1937--or from the time I was there we always report--supported Democrats.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Democrats. Okay.  And sometimes a--well we did.
Story_ID: 18856
Speaker 1: What about during World Ward II? Did you all endorse the black soldiers enlisting in?
Speaker 2: Yeah. That's one of the things I wanna talk to you about now or then when we--when we finish here. We put out a book called 'Good News For You' [sic, 'This is Our War']. And it was a book in which we sent--and we were the only black paper that sent that many reporters overseas. We had seven reporters that we sent overseas to cover activities of the black soldiers. And at that time, they were not in the front lines. But they-we covered them from England, Africa, the Artic, and in Japan. Not Japan, but in the Far East. And we had reporters going to each one of those areas. And I have a book here that's in the--right there.
Speaker 1: Okay. And it's about the coverage of it.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  This is-'This is Our War'.
Speaker 1: Okay.  'This is Our War'. And that's the time when we finally passed the 'Pittsburgh Courier' in circulation because we were--all these guys sent names home of the soldiers they interviewed and they just did a job. I mean they moved our circulation up to the place where we're were now number one in terms of circulation.
Speaker 2: Now you didn't have to go to the war yourself?  No. I was number one-number one, I had a physical problem. They put me in 4F [unfit for military service]. But also newspaper--newspapers had a special exception because they needed newspapers to spread the news and do all the good things newspapers do. So if it hadn't been for that, and plus the fact I had just gotten married and I already had one child. And so I didn't-I became 4F after Pearl--not after Pearl Harbor. After--no, after--French coast.
Speaker 1: D-Day? D-Day?
Speaker 2: D-Day yeah. And so finally I was 4F. but by that time they were dropping people off and bringing them back home.
Speaker 1: Right. That's after '44 [1944].  Yeah. And so I stayed there with the company and at that time I was doing--was I president [of Afro-American Newspapers] then? Nah. That was in '60-that was in '61 [1961] when I became president. So World War I [sic, World War II] started in '41 [1941]--'42 [1942]--'43 [1943] we went into battle. So at that time I was just a straight employee. I mean I was in an official capacity. So I stayed here. And Scotty stayed here with me for some reason. I believe he--he had something wrong with him too.
Speaker 2: Okay. That's the photographer William Scott?  That was the photographer. That's the one that we just been buddy buddies.
Speaker 1: Now did the 'Afro-American' take a position on the march on Washington [D.C.] in '48 [1948] after the war? When A. Philip Randolph had threatened to march on Washington?  Well the 'Afro' was for--well let's see. The 'Afro' very much was in favor of getting the [U.S.] Army integrated. Some of the soldiers didn't like that idea. Because very few were at the front lines. But I believe before the war was over, as a result of the Afro and other black newspapers, all of us wanted to get the army integrated. Which they finally did. I think that was under [U.S President Dwight] Eisenhower.
Speaker 2: [U.S. President Harry] Truman. No it was under Truman.  Was that under Truman?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Truman finally did it.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: In '48 [1948].
Story_ID: 18857
Speaker 1: A. Philip Randolph had threatened a march on Washington [D.C., 1948].  Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: The soldiers had come back and there was a lot of talk about, you know, fair housing and employment.  (Simultaneously) Editorially I really didn't--I really never became--my only association with being in the [Afro-American Newspapers] Editorial Department was where we had to make trips and you had to check the budget to whether they could do it or not. Like saying--.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) So you were mostly a business manager--,  (simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --of the paper. And you didn't really spend a lot of time--.  (simultaneously) and I got a good editor. And he would take care of all the editorial problems. Make sure the assignments were covered. And the two editors that were really crackerjacks under my administration was Cliff MacKay and Art Carter. They came along after [uncle] Carl Murphy did. When Carl died [1967], Cliff MacKay became the editor. And then Art Carter. And those are the two primary guys who ran the paper. And, of course, Betty Morris [Elizabeth Murphy Phillips Moss], Carl's daughter was in charge of our local paper. She was a crackerjack newspaper person. In fact, she was one of the best in the field that she was in. And so when [uncle] Arnett [Murphy] was the head of our advertisement department, but Arnett was getting to the place where he had to retire. And Carl really--although nepotism was par to of this thing, nepotism didn't keep you at the paper. If you weren't doing your job, you left.
Speaker 1: You could be fired like anybody else.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Like anybody else. In fact maybe quicker because you got more responsibility.
Story_ID: 18858
Speaker 1: When integration came, and we finally got the white papers remember the fact that they put obituaries in for black folks and black folks finally started getting married. And things that you had never seen-the things you see in the ['Baltimore] Sun' now or in the 'Washington Post' or whatever--wherever you are, you didn't see back then. Black folks were anything in the paper--only thing we got in the paper was when you killed somebody. And achievements didn't count because you just didn't achieve. But as time went on and the papers finally became integrated, then some people--I guess everybody wants to see their name in the paper. They wanna see their name in the Sun when the Sun starts doing things, they started to recognize different organizations or you-we would be in the news. And then so you lose some readership, "I'm in the paper. See me in the Sun?" Or whatever paper it might be. Wherein Baltimore [Maryland] they had the Sun, the ['Baltimore] News American' and the 'News' first--the 'News American' combined. And then the 'Evening Sun' and the 'Morning Sun'. But one thing that happened when newspaper started to closing up. Fortunately I knew really--maybe we weren't that big that when the cost of newsprint up and the cost of producing the paper became more expensive, The daily papers just started disappearing because they couldn't take care of the change in the economics. But very few black papers went out of business. And they most likely lost some of the money and some of the readership. But also at the same time, they started picking up advertising. Because advertising became marketing then. 'Cause the black--they let the businesses know how much money black folks were spending on their products. And the black were a market. And now slowly, but surely, you seem ore and more blacks on television, just being there. I mean you might wonder, well we never saw them before.  You never saw a romance or a comedy show with a brother getting along very well with somebody of another race. And--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Or with his mother-in-law.
Speaker 1: Oh that's right. And things have just changed. And it started changing around about in the '60s [1960s]. though we were still getting lynched in the '60s. But in the '70s [1970s] we became much more liberal. And the daily papers took advantage of that by giving you some publicity. You got some people who were famous. And I think really the person I think was [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.]. Because when Martin Luther King first started, he was only in the white-in the black papers. But finally when they saw what a power he was and what he was doing and what was happening, then they started to doing the King thing. And then those things started to reflect on black newspapers. Because in black folks minds, the white man's ice was always colder than the black man's ice. And that applied to almost everything.
Story_ID: 18859
Speaker 1: White papers, say the 'Baltimore Sun', if they didn't publish something, to it created the impression sometimes in the community that t didn't happen or it didn't exist, unless the 'Sun' said it.  (Simultaneously) That's right.
Speaker 2: So I know the 'Chicago Defender', the 'Pittsburgh Courier' and the 'Afro-American [Newspaper]', all these papers and the 'Negro World', when  [Marcus] Garvey had his paper--,  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --published pictures of lynchings and all the horrible things that happened to black people--,  (Simultaneously) That's right.
Speaker 2: --around the country. But it never made national news. Nobody ever talked about it on national news.  That's right.
Speaker 1: It think it kind of--do you think it kind of suspended belief that this was actually going on anywhere?  It might, it might, it might have. But I never really looked at it in that point of view. And I didn't really realize what little coverage the mainstream press did on lynching. [Emmitt] Till and those stories which were--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) 'Cause if you look at it now. If you think about how horrible those events were with hundreds of people standing around watching a man cook--,  (Simultaneously) That's right.
Speaker 1: --and then no, there's a picture of it in the ['Chicago Defender']--,  (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --but you don't see it anywhere else. And it's--you think if something like that happened now, I mean wouldn't it--it would be national news.  Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: It would be national news.  I never really thought about it--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) A whole community would get together and snatch somebody out of their house and take 'em some place and string 'em up and shoot 'em full of holes. I mean that's--.  And the fact that we covered those things were the things that kept our circulation up because they knew it was true.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the black community knew it was true.  Yeah. 'Cause you see a brother hanging from a tree, you would know he's there. And a lot of things changed that made it--Always--there always is a certain group--not a certain group. Just a mentality that the white man's product is a little better. I mean it still happens today. You call a repair man. I think it's changed a little because you feel that the white guys would do it better than the black guy, but that's not true because half the time you call a white person to do something for you, they send a black person out. And I know one incident that happened to me. And sometimes you get caught in situations, you just get caught. You can't fake it. And I was having some trouble with the switchboard. And our switchboard was on the first floor, my office was on the third floor. But I wanted to talk to the guy 'cause we were having problems. And so I came downstairs to see the fellow. And so I went--there were two fellows that were down in the lobby. And I went to the white guy and started telling him what was wrong with the phone. And the guy said, "It's not me." And I looked over and the guy said, "I got you. Didn't I?" (laughing).
Speaker 2: Okay--.  You couldn't fake it. Boy I tell you (laughing). In those days I mean there were no black guys doing telephone work.
Story_ID: 18860
Speaker 1: ...[H.L] Mencken is supposed to be the big standard for writers and--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Any rate. I was asking you about if you knew anything about [journalist, social critic] H. L. Mencken and his influence on--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No, just by name.
Speaker 1: Yeah. He influenced George Schuyler, they say, who wrote for the 'Pittsburgh Courier'. He didn't have much influence on the 'Afro-American [Newspaper'] I guess?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughing).
Speaker 2: 'Cause usually you'd hear the name in the position that I was in. Because as I said in editorial, only thing I could take pride in is the fact that I kept the 'Afro' ['Afro-American Newspaper'] financial for the twenty-five years that I was top administrator. And it's because I had good people working for me. And we watched the dollars. And, of course, when income went down, we would not hire as many people as we would normally hire. We wouldn't call like Sam Lacy covered--he must have covered about a dozen--not a dozen. At least six or seven Olympics. Wherever the Olympics went. He was--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) He was a sports writer.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And hardly any black paper had people covering all of the Olympics. He covered the one [1936 Olympics] with--in [Berlin] Germany where Jesse Owens did his thing with [Adolf] Hitler. And--well you've been reading the 'Afro' there. He just died this year. A hundred year--ninety-nine and a half.
Speaker 1: Well I heard it on the radio. I sure did. Sam Lacy.
Speaker 2: He was still working.  One day a week. He'd come over. He first came over two days a week Monday and Tuesday. And then that's the kind of loyalty that most of our employees had. Because Sam could have either gone to radio, television or any newspaper. 'Cause he knew more about black sports than anybody did. And because even the fellow from the ['Pittsburgh] Courier', I forgot his name. But Sam often mentioned him. Well all those guys retired when they were sixty and seventy if they got that far. But Sam went right on up to ninety-nine. And he came--.
Speaker 1: I think Art Rust [Jr.] of the 'Amsterdam News' was another one.
Speaker 2: Yeah. And his son [Tim Lacy] brought him to work. I mean his son was just remarkable. His son lived in--lived in Columbia [Maryland], worked in Washington [D.C.]. He went to Washington, picked his father up and brought him here to Baltimore [Maryland] to work. They usually got to work 5:30 A.M. then the son went back to his job. Took his father back to work. His father worked from about 5:00 or 5:30 or 6:00 up to 10:00. and then the son took him back to home and the went back to his job. And did that Mondays and Tuesdays. And then finally just dropped it down to just Mondays. But he drove all the way until about ninety-five. And get to work at 5:00, 5:30 and left around 10:00. And that really was the spirit of most of our employees. They tried not--a lot of jobs they tried to do  as little work and get paid as much as they could. But most of our employees really gave you the time that they needed to have to do the job. And they enjoyed because we got more twenty-year people. Now we got a couple forty and fifty year people. But Sam was sixty years he worked with the 'Afro'.
Story_ID: 18861
Speaker 1: Now what's the biggest crises you ever faced with the Afro [Afro-American Newspapers]?
Speaker 2: Well there's union problems. But that really wasn't crises. Because we had a good negotiating team. For a while I was on the team. But after I became the president [of Afro-American Newspapers], you can't put the president on the negotiating team. 'Cause you're the one that's gotta make the decisions in the end. But we worked very well with unions. And the--at the end of my career the personal thing that influenced me the most was the company was run by a voting trust which was for a ten year period. And then you had another voting trust ten years again. And whoever had the most--who's ever combination of stock gave you the majority of the majority of the stock, that's--faction would run the company. And as long as [uncle, editor-publisher of Afro-American Newspapers] Carl Murphy was alive, which was up to 1967, he just had every thing under his thumb. And he would get his voting trust together even before trust was over. And he would have a new trust, who which saved people for ten more years. And so after he died, '67 [1967], the next trust was voted on was the same way he had it. But then there became little factions in the company then. Some--Carl Murphy's family wanted more control. And then we had John Oliver who's now the present--well he was the president then. And I was chairman of the board. So they had some factions in the family. And we had a very--it was a nasty lawsuit to make the trust illegal. Because the Carl Murphy faction since they owned the most shares of stock by themselves large stockholders, they were--weren't the majority stockholders. And so the case went on about two or three years. And finally the judge said that we were wrong. That the trust should be broken off at the end of every ten years and a new trust started. You can't start the new trust until the old trust was over. But we only had two years left to go. So it stayed in effect for those two years. And then the next time we voted, it was so close that the faction that I was in charge of won the vote by less than a vote. It was around about one sixth, one eighth of a vote. To be in for ten more years. So we stay in for ten more years. But in the meantime, the new fact--the old faction that was out, convinced John Oliver who was then the president and one of the key members on our side of the voting trust to come over to their side. And for doing that they--they promised him that they would make his son who is now the president, charge--not president . He was the CEO. Jake Oliver. That he would be president. Or he would run the company. And so in 1986 when they had the election then, they won the election because John Oliver put his votes who were ours before on the other side. And that's when I retired. And I could have worked one more year up to seventy I think. Seventy-two. But I was seventy when I retired. Because the bylaws said, unless the stockholders agree to let you stay on, you have to retire. So since they had the votes (laughing) that took care of that. And that was in my judgment one of the mistakes that the administration made then that everybody under my administration was let go. They had to retire. And even though some of them wanted to continue working, but the stock--the new administration had to start with no pinnings underneath them. And they really--just really never got to the same efficiency. So--but they-in time you learn. And that's '86 [1986] up until now. That's '86, '96 [1996] almost twenty years. We're in there hustling. Everybody's now okay.  And those things happen. We don't remain enemies forever. And so the whole family is still together. We come to stockholders meeting.

Speaker 1: We'll ['Afro-American Newspaper'] never be where we were nor will any black paper. Nor will any newspaper be where they were twenty years ago.  Even though they have monopolies now. The ['Baltimore] Sun' had to drop off their evening paper ['Evening Sun']. And now they only have just one paper, which is the 'Morning Sun'. So newspapers--I don't know whether--I think newspapers eventually won't be. Because there're so many other means of communication. That you're gonna lose--of course, you have to get on the Internet, you have to have a newspaper (unclear) don't you? So (laughing) newspaper you can get on the Internet. And even in the 'Afro's; case, to be on--the 'Afro's 'on the Internet. A person can read the whole paper on their Internet. Unfortunately I don't have even a computer. So I still like to get my subscription. But the golden age of newspapers is gone. And it's now on the--what do you call them? The Internets. Those are the guys who are the billionaires now. Looked in the paper other day, they had the top twenty 'Forbes' top twenty. And the top ten of them were all in the Internet business. So times have changed. Everything changes. But I still think there's a place for the black press. And we've had a lot of sponsors. There have been very few of them went out of business. Because when we went from hot type to cold type, the cost of producing a paper became much less. Now the presses cost less. The equipment--we had thirteen Linotype machines in our plant to take care of the--set the type. Now we have one computer that does the whole thing, and two operators. Before we had union people--I believe those people are still union people. But we had thirteen--in our mechanical department we had over fifty employees--,
Speaker 2: Now it's cut down--.
Speaker 1: --working three shifts.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Day shift, night shift and the lobster shift.
Speaker 2: The lobster shift (laughing).
Speaker 1: The lobsters came in at 4:00 and left to (unclear) around about 5:00 in the morning.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Or even earlier. But we had three shifts. But now you got--we've got one girl that can almost do it by herself. But we have two people now operating the computers. And they do all that same work.
Speaker 2: So two people do the work that fifty used to do.
Speaker 1: That's right. Actually you--you better make that four because you have some layout people that aren't typesetters.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I mean the difference is almost unbelievable. And so that's shows you how--in fact, if you can know how to use a computer well enough, you can almost put your own newspaper out. That' what people are doing. People now that--job shops are catching hell because companies have their own offset machine. They put out their own weekly paper. I'm sure, NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] has a copy machine up there. And they do a lot of their stuff right there in the office. And so printing has become--everybody's a printer. You get Christmas cards now, kids make their own Christmas cards. I get cards from my granddaughter up in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]. Beautiful cards. Personally made.
Speaker 2: Printed on their own.
Speaker 1: Made by--made by Karen for Pop Pop, or whatever. And so that affects your whole industry. Computers have done that to the industry.
Story_ID: 18863
Speaker 1: What's been the highlight of being involved in the Afro [Afro-American Newspapers]?
Speaker 2: Well really I was more--as I said, I was more associated with the circulation department than any other department. And the number of boys that have come through. In Washington [D.C.] we had five hundred boys. In Baltimore [Maryland] we had five hundred newsboys. And that is a nesting ground for new leadership. I went to New York one time for a meeting. And I forgot the fellow's name. He's with one of your very top companies. One of your vice presidents. And we got to talking. And he said, "I sold 'Afros.'" Maybe he sold them in another city. But he said, "That was one of my first jobs I had." And being a newspaper boy really is a, your entree into the business world. You gotta take care of customers. You gotta collect money. You gotta pay money. You gotta have a profit. And they were a different type of boys than the guys that--part of the death of the newspaper boy was number one, adults started taking over the delivery of papers. The home delivery. I mean we got the ['Baltimore] Sun' paper.  The guy has the billing he sends to you. You send the money back and you don't even see the newsboy any more. And this is just as true in the white press as it in is in the black press. Magazines used to--I sold--part of my eighteen dollars a week I was with Cromwell Publishing Company. I sold 'Collier's' and the Women's Home Journal [sic, 'Ladies' Home Journal']. And they had prizes and contests. And they used the kids for marketing. But very seldom were the kids that sold papers turned out to be bad kids. And I got some pictures here which I didn't even bring into this because I didn't think it was (unclear) where in we took three busloads of kids, the top salesmen up to New York for a week. And it was round about a--close to a hundred kids up there.
Speaker 1: Would you do that every year? Or would you--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a contest. You know, we'd do different things each year. We took one group to Chicago [Illinois] to the World's Fair. I didn't go with that one. But I went with the one going to New York. And we visited Chinatown. This is a little sidebar thing. And when we left Chinatown, we were staying at the Y [YMCA]. And we went on subways and everything. It was under control. And it poured down raining. And in ten seconds you looked around it was not a newsboy in sight. I mean they were in doorways. I mean--they just disappeared. And we went on back up to the Y. Everybody went up there. And in half an hour everybody was back at the Y. Be--know how we did it on the subway. We had been up there a couple of days. I mean going places on the subway. We all gave them some spare change. They all knew how to get back to the Y and we were back there. 'Cause the kids were intelligent kids. And they knew what to do. When they were in New York they had part of their profit and they had their own money. And we were building character. And really that was one of the things that you would not expect me to even say, that it was something else that was more important. The integration. The things that the newspaper did because it was a newspaper. And this thing of e getting integration where we needed I know [uncle, publisher-editor of 'Afro-American Newspaper'] Carl Murphy one of his things he--was on his list was to make sure that we got black tellers in banks that dealt with black people. And finally he--The Calvert Bank--I think was the first bank he got to get black tellers. Where 90 percent of their business was black folks. And they still had white tellers there. And the same thing was true about the five and tens in Baltimore. Not only in Baltimore, in all the cities. That when you went to where there were businesses back in the '20s [1920s]--not the '20s. The '30s, the '40s [1940s] and the '50s [1950s], white folks were running the business. They didn't hire black folks. But now almost every white company not only has hired black guys to do their business which comes to black neighborhoods like Roter Rooter. It used to be a time that you call Roter Rooter a white guy come to your house. But now they start off with having a black guys that they send to black houses. But now you have black guys going everywhere. And so it's helping the black community in terms of the economic power. And so the black newspaper was very influential in that. And so really that's one of the things that I'm proud of in my administration and proud of the 'Afro'. That we made that kind of contribution in turning the wheel--turning the--making the white community conscious of the fact that you had black folks that can do the same things that you're doing. And for the most part, that was one of the things that white folks were afraid of. 'Cause everybody's afraid of their job. And when you see a black brother come in, automatically you would give him a hard way to go. 'Cause he's taking maybe the job of your cousin or your brother or your sister or whatever. The same thing applies in the school system or anywhere now that black folks don't have to just teach black kids. They can teach white kids too. And that goes all the way up to the college level. And it didn't happen overnight.
Story_ID: 18864
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: The--it's positive. But we have to--there's a level of white folks call it ghetto. Ghetto is not a black term. Ghetto is a Jewish term. And it just meant an area where Jews lived. It had nothing to do with economics. But now ghetto is economics. And there are more places now where you'll get some degree of integration in housing that's gonna make it better for your whole community, in knowing that you're next door neighbor could be white or black and it's okay. But we've got to get rid of or do something with--I don't know whether crack is doing it, dope is doing it. But dope is taking over--they take over the city. 'Cause they--everybody--what's the guy's name? Mat O--[Baltimore, Maryland Mayor Martin] O'Malley. "We're gonna get rid of it." You ride down (unclear) Town Road, any street. You look on the corners a brother waiting. I thought he was looking for a cab. I mean years ago I thought that. Now not only the fellows on the corner, the women are on the corner. Some of them with the babies in their arm. And until you get rid of that, and--'cause it's making money. It's making money for them.  It's making money for somebody higher up. And somebody at the very top is a billionaire because of it. And how you can beat it, I don't know. But that's not good. And it's bad news for blacks more than it is for whites. See 'cause we're at the bottom of the ladder economically. And everybody wants to get out of it. And I think that the guys that are selling crack, a lot of them are doing it for money. They ain't--the guys that are selling it, I don't think they're using it.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: But it's some business. "What you doing?" "Selling crack. I make more than you make." And most likely they do. But it doesn't help. So how you gonna--you gotta almost beat that before you beat the other thing. And even now in Columbia [Maryland] you're having a little bit--and Columbia is the top of the line when it comes to communities. And newspapers in general help. Because I've done a lot of work with the 'Baltimore Times'. You may not be familiar with them. But after I left the 'Afro' [Afro-American Newspapers], I went into photography. 'Cause that had been my hobby all my life. And--not all my life. Since I came to Washington [D.C.]. Because my roommate was a photographer. And so he taught me photography. But you just sometimes--some things you just have to fight them through until you kind of get to a point where you can see some progress.  But like in Columbia which is the top of the line in terms of integration, there's a Jim [James]  Rouse [urban planner, real estate developer]. That was his baby. And that was the idea of Columbia to really have an integrated community. Which he did. But now--.
Speaker 1: That's a neighborhood here in Baltimore?
Speaker 2: No, it's halfway between Baltimore and Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They have people in Columbia that live in Washington, and people in Columbia work in Baltimore. And it's a high scale community. It's one of the highest income communities in the country. Along with Montgomery County [Maryland] and some of the counties in Virginia. And--but the people that could either afford it both culturally and economically have left Baltimore City. And the middle of the city is just falling apart. And in Washington it's a little better off. Because I know many communities in Washington, white folks are coming back into these black communities, because they wanna be near work. They wanna be near the city. And where you have some of these beautiful homes in Washington that are owned by blacks, they move out, white folks move right on in. And so more white folks are moving back into Washington than are moving back into Baltimore. But there are some pockets where new housing is being built. And the new housing isn't completely integrated in the center of cities. But I believe it's gonna work eventually. Not in my time. But I'm thinking of my children.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) But sooner or later--.
Speaker 2: My grandchildren's time. 'Cause my children are really--they're better off than I was. And that's another thing that I think is happening. That every generation I remember they strived to get their kids better off than they are. Except the generation that's here now. I mean they--they're--they don't have that same thing. That we said our kids have got to make it. But now when we would make it. I'm a third generation from my grandfather. And my son is fourth. That fifth generation is--doesn't have the same attitude towards their children overall. There're exceptions to everything. That we're gonna make our kids better off than we are. 'Cause the kids are not better off than they are. and I don't know what the answer to that is. Of course, crack is one of them.
Speaker 1: That's true.
Speaker 2: It's a disease that we can solve. But it's too much money up top I believe to solve it.
Speaker 1: And certainly they're trying to solve it with stiffer penalties and so forth.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But that's not--it doesn't seem to be working.  And there's just as many kids up and down-I mean when you drive up (unclear) Town Road, any time of any day, somebody will be--especially on weekends, you see the mothers, babies. It's just like more girls are doing the hustle now than the boys.
Speaker 2: Oh I think they're more available probably.
Speaker 1: That's right.

Speaker 1: When you look back on all the things you've done, what would you consider at this point as your legacy?
Speaker 2: I really think I'm a people person. And if I can make people achieve their highest, either through the 'Afro' [Afro-American Newspapers] or through anything-I've been teaching Sunday School for over forty years. And I try to emphasize on any-and usually sixth, seventh and eighth grades. That's the kids time can still be molded.  That they can do anything they want to do. I mean--and sometimes I talk about Jesus Christ and God and the Ten Commandments. But I also talk about what you can do tomorrow in school. What's your goal in life? And now some kids will tell me they wanna be the mayor. Now in our church we fortunately in a very poor neighborhood. Now it was a very upscale neighborhood. But now it's one of the poor neighborhoods. So we have as many poor kids in our church school as we have the traditional kids that normally would come to church school. And they have integrated themselves. I mean they don't look down on the kids in the neighborhood. And they kids know they're not looking down on. And right now a couple of them are in the army now. And they're--and several--most of them come through--our last graduating class we had about eight kids who graduated from church school. All eight of them went to a college. They Went to Coppin [State University, Baltimore, Maryland]. They went to Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland]. They went to two-year colleges, city colleges. But all of them went to college. Now whether they'll all go through or not, I don't know. And half of them were community kids and half of them were your typical Episcopalian (laughing) kids that are gonna make it. And every job I've had, I've been concerned with people. And if the people work with you, the money will come.

Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: That's almost the answer I give you--the same question I just answered.  I want people to remember me as, somebody who gives something to their life.  That encouraged them to move ahead. Whether it was somebody at the Afro [Afro-American Newspapers], somebody we brought in.  I know that my secretary whose name is Odessa Dyson (ph.), the best secretary anybody ever had. And we'd bring in somebody to be a switchboard or secretary.  They would come into the office and they would look a little seedy.  And they might have a little impediment in speech. Where was I at or something like that.  But we would hire 'em.  I mean they weren't that bad. We would still hire them.  And in six months time you would not know that person from the person that came in.  His clothes would change. They didn't get that much money.  They got a good job.  I mean it wasn't a great big difference from what they were doing before.  I think it was the place they were. They spoke better. They had better telephone manners.  I mean you could see the change in six months. And this would happen in many cases.  Now I think that happened in--those five hundred newsboys that we had.  Out of those five hundred newsboys I would bet you four hundred of 'em are successful in life.  And the other one hundred maybe even (unclear) keep all of 'em.  The employees that left the Afro-and there were very few that just left.  They are better people now than they were when they came there.  And they can transfer that same thing to other people who they come in contact with.  And to keep a business alive it's now in it's hundredth-and almost tenth--it's past 110. 'Cause in '92 [1892] to '92 [1992] and then we're up to '03 [2003].
Speaker 1: 111.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) 111 years old.  In the same family.  All of us had some problems here and there. But to survive over that time, I think that's a tribute to just the family itself and how they treat people and how they've become efficient in the job that they're in.  Which was not the jobs that were traditionally black jobs. They weren't black jobs. The newspaper business was white jobs.  And--because newspapers for black folks--our first newspaper was 1821 I think.  John Russwurm's paper.
Speaker 1: 1827.
Speaker 2: 18--yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Freedom's Journal'.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'Freedom's Journal'. And that--that contribution that we as a newspaper made in the whole economic and social and cultural thing of America is something that doesn't happen--everybody can't say that they were a part of that--,
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because I feel that in Baltimore [Maryland] the five hundred boys--five hundred of them knew me. The almost knew me personally. Because I'd go to some of their meetings.  Of course, those that came to the office--all those that came to the office would know me, because I'm at the office.  But the people who worked for me knew me.  It's hardly anybody that worked--we had around, tops, two hundred and some employees. That was all over the papers I'm telling you.  Over, over 30 percent of them knew me personally.  And I think that knowing me and how I treated them and how I ran the paper made them better people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I've touched thousands of people that I think I made better.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's--that's the contribution I think I've made when I left here.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: That people will remember me as doing something good for them.  Or I thank you for doing it or whatever. That's good enough.
