Story_ID: 643313
Speaker 1: Now I'm going to ask you some questions about your family history, starting with your mother.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What was her name and date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her name was Ella Cecilia Peters Flemings [Ella Peters Flemings], after she married my dad [Amos Flemings], she was born in Mobile, Alabama on April 23, 1909.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, and how would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: How does anybody describe their mother?  They're loving, they're loving.  She was loving, she was giving, she was caring.  She left her profession.  She was a teacher and she left that to raise her three daughters [Small and her sisters, Eunita Flemings Johnson and Maxine Flemings Leftwich] so she was a very giving, caring woman.  Of course people did that in that day and age but she did.
Speaker 1: And was she, did she have a profession?
Speaker 2: She was a teacher.  She graduated from Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] in 1932 in home--with a degree in home economics but she went on to teach school.  She took, actually she taught English and we learned that all our lives, our young lives, we were always corrected (laughter).
Speaker 1: What grade level did she teach?
Speaker 2: Fourth grade I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she's a elementary school teacher (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, um-hm.
Story_ID: 643314
Speaker 1: Do you know much about her parents or--
Speaker 2: I do, I do.  I know about her parents, I know about her grandparents, I know about her great-grandparents.  We just had a family, a very, very prominent, loving, caring family member to pass away in Columbia, Missouri and we were all there and we were just, these are, all our aunts and uncles are gone but these were various first cousins and first cousins once removed and we were talking about this just recently, just the 1st of July.  Her father [Charles Peters, Sr.], and we had a re- family reunion in 2006 in Mobile, and we're spread across the country right now so we all went back.  It turns out he was, he had nine children, my mother [Ella Peters Flemings] was the third youngest and he owned a general store, he had life, owned a life--and had started and owned and ran a life insurance company and owned nine, ten homes in what is now downtown Mobile, Alabama.  The major street, like our State Street, is called Government Street and this is called Dauphin Avenue and it is the Wabash [Avenue], it would be the Wabash to our State.  It is the street right behind it.  It was so remarkable, actually, that during our family reunion, we found out and had one of our meals at the location of his general store which is, and above that, he ran his life insurance company, and it's still there, it's still intact and the owners took us upstairs to see the store and how, the quarters and to let us see what had been renovated and it was still original fireplaces and so forth but anyway, when the newspaper, the Mobile Register [Press Register] found that out, they called and they did a huge story on our family because it's a very prominent and famous restaurant now.  There are about seven or eight of them around the, around the eastern half of the United States and they keep growing, it's called Wintzell's Oyster House and when they found out that that was indeed his original place of business, who originally owned the building and how much property he owned on that street, they, on the phone, their comment to me was, I said to the reporter who called to ask me about this, I said to her, "Isn't that somewhat unusual for someone in the late 1800s," it was 1890, 18--very early, I said, "That's a little unusual for an African American to have that kind of, to have accumulated that kind of property," and she, her comment was, "Y'all an African American family?"  And, so, yeah, and I responded, so then they sent a re- when we arrived, they sent a reporter over to see this African American family and then they did a half page, no, a full page article on us, including pictures and that was great fun, yeah.  So I do know about her father.  I know that her father died when she was eleven.  I know that her mother [Athelstan Carter Peters] died when she was nine.  Her mother had tuberculosis.  In the last few years, I know she talked about the fact that her father had a, owned an island and they had a summer home that they'd all pack up and go to, except her father, her father would stay and work but all the children and her mother would go and she said she now realizes that she had tuberculosis.  Her mother had tuberculosis back in, must have been 1920, '21 [1921] and she said, "I realize now she was really going," and the woman that she thought was a helper, was actually her mother's caretaker and she said, "I now realized we were going because she was so sick."
Speaker 1: And where was this island?
Speaker 2: It's off the coast of Mobile.  You know there are lots of islands down there in the bay area, in Mobile Bay.  She talked, and I think it was named Fairhope [Alabama], I think it was Fairhope and I just saw it in the newspaper the other day because I'm sure they, I know they don't own it anymore.  After he died, they sold a lot of his property and a lot of the, when you have nine sibs [siblings], decisions get made by the older ones and as I say, my mother was very young when both her parents died, although she lived with a sister and grew up with her sister [Eunita Peters Taylor] and brother-in-law [John Taylor].
Speaker 1: Do you know what year he was born?
Speaker 2: My grandfather?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well, let me see if I can back into that.  Eighteen--let's see.  He died in his fifties and he died when she was eleven so that would be in the early 1920s.  So I'd say 1870 some, late '60s [1860s], early 1870s.
Speaker 1: That sounds about right, yeah.  Now the kind of education your grandfather had?
Speaker 2: High school.  He was born, I think, in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi and stayed there through his very early years and moved to Mobile where he met my grandmother who I never knew and she was born in Mobile, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know why he came to Mobile?
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't.  Well, I think he was, my assumption is business reasons.  I'm sure he was always entrepreneurial and I think he was interested in expanding and my understanding is that Mobile, from a racial standpoint, was less restrictive than Mississippi, State of Ala- that part of Alabama was less restrictive.
Story_ID: 643315
Speaker 1: Now how about your [maternal] grandmother?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us a little bit about her?
Speaker 2: Sure.  Her name was Athelstan Lillian Carter [Athelstan Carter Peters], she was born a Carter, Peters.  I have a picture of her when she went off to college in 1898.  She went from Mobile [Alabama], she went to Wilberforce college [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio] and was--in 18--not 1898, I'm sorry, 1890, she went to Wilberforce college and she finished there and I've always wondered how is it that you decide to send your eighteen year old that far by stagecoach or whatever, from the southern part of the most southern city on that part of the United States that far to Wilberforce, Ohio.  But anyway, her father did and her parents did, I should say, and she finished, moved back to Mobile and I'm not exactly sure how they met but I think she was several years younger than he and her family, she was, her family was, owned a business, they were florists in the city.  So I'm not, and as I say, I don't know how they met.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Could you spell her first name for us, please?
Speaker 2: Sure, it's A-T-H-E-L-S-T-A-N, Athelstan.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what year was she born?
Speaker 2: Good question, let me see if I can back into that.  I wish I had my book in my hand.  She was born in, she died in 1918, I think she died around 1918, 19--yeah, about 1918 and she was forty some when she was--died, so I would say somewhere around 1880s maybe.  You know, she was eighteen when she went off to college and it was 1898.  I apologize, it was 1898, not 1890, so she would have been born somewhere around 1880.
Speaker 1: Do you know what she majored in at Wilberforce?
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't.  She came back and I think she taught school a little bit but I'm not sure if she taught it very long 'cause I think she met my grandfather [Charles Peters, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, what, did she become a homemaker?
Speaker 2: Yes, she had nine children.
Speaker 1: That would make you a homemaker.
Speaker 2: It does make you a homemaker.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But my mother [Ella Peters Flemings] always talked about the fact that she was very fortunate she grew up privileged.  She said, "We grew up with help 'cause, you know," she said, "my mother couldn't take care of nine children and my father was old--was, had enough resources to be able to afford to supply her with help," so I didn't grow up with help but she did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you say you can go back a couple of more gen- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Generations?
Speaker 1: Your great-grandfather--okay.
Speaker 2: On my mother's side, I can.  In 2006, we, as I say, we had a reunion.  Oh, I wish I brought pictures.  There are pictures of me, of me and my two sisters [Eunita Flemings Johnson and Maxine Flemings Leftwich] standing on, above ground graves of several ancestors who go back to the 1700s and their graves are in a cemetery called Magnolia Cemetery which is oddly a white cemetery in Mobile.  As a matter of fact when we were there, I asked, quietly asked one of the ladies, the secretary of the cemetery who works in the office, I said to her, "Now are we in a special segregated or isolated place in the cemetery" because I didn't think that that happened and it didn't even happen in Chicago [Illinois] when I was a little girl and she said to me in another lovely southern drawl, "No, y'all are buried all over Magnolia Cemetery."  So we went on a bus tour, our family did, to see these gravesites.  My mother's grandparents and great-grandparents are buried there.  Let's see.  My mother's, my grandmother's parents were Carter.  The Carters, as I say, were business--owned a business in Mobile, they were florists, and had their own floral shop, and her, my grandmother, so my great-grandmother's, let's see, my grandmother's grandmother would be my great-great, is that right?
Speaker 1: Yes, it should be two greats.
Speaker 2: Two greats.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  My great-great-grandmother [sic. great-grandmother] was Sarah Abbott [sic. Sarah Perteet Carter] and we do, my, and my sister has traced the Abbotts back to Tuscaloosa [Alabama].
Story_ID: 643316
Speaker 1: Actually we go, let me start at the beginning and go forward, that's a little easier than going backwards.  Solomon Perteet was born, we think, records indicate born of the son of a white free woman and a slave, her name was Ruth Perteet.  Ruth Perteet, and we can't figure out how, we don't know how, we don't know what happened, had a black child, Solomon, and she raised him, she reared him in Georgia and when he was eighteen, she met someone and wanted to marry this gentleman, who was white, and so she sent her son with a caretaker to Alabama, he was eighteen at that point, and she gave him his freedom, which I guess he already had because he was born to a free white mother.  Anyway, he moved to Alabama and conducted business, was rather successful.  If you look, if, there's an article about him online.  He made quite a bit of money in Tu- the Tuscaloosa [Alabama] area and apparently bought up a lot of, bought a lot of property in the Tuscaloosa area.  We keep salivating saying, "I'm sure some of the University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama] is on that, on our property," but anyway--
Speaker 2: The football field.
Speaker 1: Sure, well, could be.  We have, and there are, another cousin who wrote the book that I mentioned earlier, did find documents.  So there's documentation that he owned property, that his son owned property.  His daughter married a gentleman named James Abbott so James and Sarah Abbott [sic. Martha Perteet Abbott] owned property in Tuscaloosa and James was especially successful, that's the, that's Solomon's son-in-law, Solomon's daughter's husband.  So Solomon's daughter, Sarah and James were quite successful and there's a lot of, there are a number of deeds, records, deeds in records in Tuscaloosa that a cousin has and she compiled those and copied them and put them into a book and I must give her credit.  She's gone now but she did all of this back in the very early 1980s before any of us had access to computers and duplicating machines, so it was all hand typed and Xeroxed but she went and you couldn't access this, of course, any other way than to go to the library, go to the court records and go to the county records offices and really just plow through files.  So she did that and she found a number of documents, of, especially from James and Sarah Abbott.  Apparently, he bought slaves and then gave them their freedom.  I think at the last count, I think we had seventy-eight.  We're up to a number, we counted them in the book.  There are about seventy-eight that we could find.  If you Google Solomon Perteet, he pops up because someone from England and another gentleman from the University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa] has decided to do some research on him.  So there's more information, so you can find out that way, that's one of the ways that we found out.
Speaker 2: Do you know what year he was born?
Speaker 1: Seventeen, 17 something, I'm not sure, 17 something [1787].
Speaker 2: So were his children free?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: They were all--
Speaker 1: All of his children were free.
Speaker 2: All--okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, yeah.  He was the last, the last owned human in our family, I think, yeah, and at our, at this gathering I just spoke about in Columbia [Missouri] when a cousin died, one cousin came up to me and she said, "Your nephew, your great nephew, Joey [ph.], just graduated?"  I said, "Yeah, just from Western Michigan [Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, Michigan]" and she looked at me and gave me a hug and said, "Congratulations, he's the fifth generation in our family to finish college," so which was fun to hear, that's fun, yeah.
Story_ID: 643317
Speaker 1: Were you able to find any information about Solomon's father?
Speaker 2: No.  There--my sister has researched Solomon's father.  There is a possibility his name is Richard Perteet.  There was a Richard Perteet in Georgia on the, Ruth Perteet's family's property but when, no, that's wrong.  Richard Perteet was not the black man, we don't know anything about the slave.  We know little bit more about the Perteet family but, no, we don't, and it's hard for me to even fathom how this happened because that was not, and did he live, I mean, you know, we don't, we all know that doesn't happen, and it's also hard to understand, or to, I mean I know it happened, but it's hard to understand under what circumstances she kept her son.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Unless her father just worshiped his daughter and allowed her to keep him in secret or, but at eighteen, she was ready to be married to a man of her own race and so that's when she freed her son and sent him with a caretaker off to Alabama to live.
Speaker 1: Now how do you spell Perteet?
Speaker 2: Several ways.  In, when you look it up, there's several ways but this is the most common way we've found is P-E-R-T, double E-T, P-E-R-T-E-E-T, Solomon Perteet, that's what I've Googled.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, now your, what is this, your great-great--
Speaker 2: Solomon would be my fourth great-grandfather [sic. great-great-grandfather].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, or is it third, wait a minute.  My grandfather, James [sic.], it's either third or fourth, I lose track, without the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --without that lovely chart that we have.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he's in Alabama, now his children--
Speaker 2: All in Alabama.
Speaker 1: All in Alabama, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and many of them are in Tuscaloosa [Alabama] and we keep saying we're going to make a journey there but we haven't done that yet, but a lot (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: Sarah Carter [Sarah Perteet Carter], my grandmother's mother is buried in Mobile [Alabama].  Somehow they got from Tuscaloosa to Mobile and I'm not sure I know that story.
Speaker 1: Were you able to find out any information about the caretaker?  Was this a friend of Perteet's or was it--
Speaker 2: I don't know.  You mean the gentleman, the person who escorted Solomon to Mo- to Alabama?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I have no idea, I have no idea.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, you know, I'm not sure how much you can trust all of those things online because I don't know how they get start- how those tales get carried, but some of, but in terms of what he had accumulated, how hard he worked, who he owned, what he sold and so forth, those are all documented records we have.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Then his children, now when did they get to Tuscaloosa?  Do you know what year that was?
Speaker 2: I think Solomon got to Tuscaloosa when he was eighteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it would have been in the very early 1800s or late 1700s.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was before the University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama] was founded and I've seen the deeds of several pieces of property.
Speaker 1: Do you know whether any of his children were involved in the Civil War?
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't 'cause there were sol- black soldiers in the South that were in the Civil War.  I don't know.  There are a couple of newspaper articles, there were a couple of articles by, as I mentioned, the Englishman who decided to do a research project on him and then I think a professor at the University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa] and I'm not sure if it was his doctoral thesis or not, his dissertation or not, but some of that has come from there and they have done a pretty decent research and some of it, of that is online.
Speaker 1: What is the professor's name from the University of Iowa?
Speaker 2: Oh, I knew you were going to ask me that.  I knew you were going to ask that.  I should have brought all my documents.  I didn't realize we were going to do so much family history (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Do you know the name of the researcher from England?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, I know them, I've just forgotten them (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: And I'm not going to be able to pull them up right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I can call you with that information, though, or even email it to you.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, we'll talk about that when we get there (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 643318
Speaker 1: So you got [maternal] family in Tuscaloosa [Alabama].
Speaker 2: We did have family.
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We have no one there--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Everybody's been in Mobile [Alabama] and not very many there either.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, so they go to Mobile and that's kind of where your family stayed--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) for a while?
Speaker 2: Yes, this is my grand- this is my maternal grandmother's [Athelstan Carter Peters] family we're talking about.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And that's also where your mother [Ella Peters Flemings] was born?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did your mother, how many siblings did she have?
Speaker 2: Nine.
Speaker 1: Nine.  And do you know, can you--
Speaker 2: I knew every one of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Could you give us their names, start with--and their birth order if you know it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know, I'm pretty sure I know it.  Valena [Valena Peters Allen] was her older sister and she went to Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].  The next one was Leana [Leana Peters Battle] and they went off, a year apart, 'cause I think they were a year, a year and a half apart.  So they both attended Spelman and they were there together.  (Unclear) I had an uncle, Charles [Charles Peters, Jr.], who was next and I believe he went to Talladega [Talladega College, Talladega, Alabama].  My Aunt Eunita [Eunita Peters Taylor], my older sister [Eunita Flemings Johnson] is named for her and I'm named for her husband [John Taylor], so is the, went, later to Spelman, no she didn't, she went to Alabama State [State Normal School for Colored Students; Alabama State University, Montgomery, Alabama], I'm sorry, she went to Alabama State College.  She's the sister who reared my mother after her parents died.  My grandfather left, had three young children and left a will and a trust fund for each of his three young children to be reared by their, each one of them by a different sib [sibling] and my Aunt Eunita was the one who raised my mother, reared my mother from the time she was nine and her husband was a physician in Mobile and had his own hospital.  So those were like my grandparents.  You know, they were the only grandparents I ever knew and since they had no natural children, we were their only grandchildren, so it was a very close relationship.  After my Aunt Eunita, there is, where am I, two, three, oh, my Uncle Nathaniel [Nathaniel Peters].
Speaker 1: Did he go to college?
Speaker 2: He did, he went to Talladega.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: After him, that's five, there are, one, two three more, let me just think.  Then I guess, there's one in between, right before my mother.  I have to think about that, who that is.  (Unclear) Uncle Charles, my Uncle Tannie, my mother, I said, Valena, Leana, Charles, Eunita, Nathaniel, that's five, right?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: My mother was six, her younger sister is, no, she had a, her younger sister is Ethel [Athelstan Peters Trenier].  There's another one missing.  Her younger sister is Ethel and her youngest brother is Preston [Preston Peters].  Now let me, Ethel by the way changed her name.  Ethel's name was Athelstan, and my grandfather's name was, did I tell you his name?  I didn't.  His name was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Charles Warren Peters [Charles Peters, Sr.].  So, he was named, my Uncle Charles was named after him.  My grandmother, my grandmother's father's name was, I'm sorry, my grandmother's mother [sic. stepmother], my maternal grandmother, my maternal great-grandmother [Leana Carter] had a maiden name of Preston [sic.].  So that was the youngest, my mother's youngest brother was named Preston.  We must have seventeen Prestons and seventeen Charleses in our family somewhere along the line but, there's one I'm missing.  Who am I missing?  That's so odd.  Somebody's dropped off the radar screen.
Speaker 1: Was this a younger sibling or an older sibling (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It would be, it would be right before my mother.  I'm missing somebody there.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Oh, my Aunt Odessa [Odessa Peters Wiggins].
Speaker 1: You see, I knew it was going to come back to you.
Story_ID: 643319
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned that there was a physician that had his own hospital?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my, we always called him our grandfather but he wasn't, he was really our [maternal] uncle [John Taylor] by marriage.  He married my mother's sister [Eunita Peters Taylor] and my mother's sister and this uncle reared her.  And, you know, when you're born as a child, you really don't know in-laws, they're just aunts and uncles, that's what my nieces all tell my husband [Lynn Small].  So he was, he was a physician.  He had finished Meharry [Meharry Medical Department of Central Tennessee College; Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee].  I think he was from, let's see, he was from Virginia, went to Meharry and I'm not sure how he ended up in Mobile [Alabama] but maybe he met my aunt somewhere and moved there with her but, yes, and he had a hospital.  You know, hospitals were, most hospitals in the South were segregated.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So he had a very, very, he went and bought a very, very, very large home and a small portion on the first floor, this was after my mother, no it wasn't, she was there.  When we were children, we would go and visit and a small portion, or a decent size portion, was their living quarters and then there was another entrance in a whole 'nother part of this rather institutional looking building that was a hospital.  By the time we were born, I was born and I'm the second of three girls, by the time I was born, it was, he had pretty much closed down that hospital and was practicing out of an office and participating in other hospitals in the, in the city.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the name of the hospital?
Speaker 2: His hospital, I do not, I do not.  Isn't that interesting?  I've never thought of it because I've always thought of that haunted house.  We used to go and play in those rooms and would tease each other what was going on.  No, I don't.  You know, we were born in Chicago [Illinois] and my parents [Ella Peters Flemings and Amos Flemings] were here for three, four, five years before we were born, no, three year--four years before we were born so we would go on visits and, but just summer visits and maybe an occasional Thanksgiving or so but, and they actually, my, the aunt and uncle who reared my mother came all the time to visit us.
Story_ID: 643320
Speaker 1: We were talking about your mother's [Ella Peters Flemings] side of the family and we've gotten all the way back to the 1700s at this point.  Is there any other history on your mother's side that we haven't talked about?
Speaker 2: Yes, there is.  It's a very interesting story and I mentioned earlier, James Abbott, and this is not 100 percent authenticated but we're pretty close and I'm not sure how we get to 100 percent.  Anyway, James Abbott, we think, we're pretty sure, was from, well, we know he was from Virginia.  There is a Wilson Abbott [Wilson Ruffin Abbott] who is from Virginia and who had a brother James Abbott and James and Wilson Abbott traveled from Virginia to Tuscaloosa [Alabama], this is why we think it's actually the same person.  Wilson went north to Toronto [Canada] and James stayed in Tuscaloosa and accumulated the things that I talked about before.  Wilson, his brother, and you always wonder how did people get from Tuscaloosa to Canada, anyway, he ended up in a small town in Canada and then later in Toronto and he actually was just like his brother, if indeed they were brothers, and I think, I think they were, he's just like his brother.  He accumulated a lot of real estate, a lot of wealth there and one of the places, pieces of property he owned was the property on which the city hall of Toronto now sits.  He had a couple of sons, maybe more than a couple of sons, but Wilson's family has a book called, 'Family Secrets' ['Family Secrets: Crossing the Color Line,' Catherine Slaney] which you can get from amazon.com.  I think I even have it on a, I think they even have, I think I have it on my Kindle, anyway, I mean, on my iPad.  He had a son [Anderson Ruffin Abbott] who became the first doctor to graduate from the University of Toronto medical school [Toronto School of Medicine; University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine, Toronto, Canada], practiced a little bit in the United States, had children and I think they must have married, married either lighter, I think eventually, early on, they married lighter skinned Afr- Afro-Canadians, I guess they would be called, and then they married lighter skinned and apparently somewhere down the line someone decided to start passing in Canada or at least didn't tell the, when they married a white, one of his grandsons, I believe, married a white woman in Canada and didn't tell his, her family that he was indeed black and eventually they all passed.  Younger people didn't know who they were.  About six or eight, no, longer than that, maybe ten or twelve years ago, a woman named Cathy Slaney [Catherine Slaney] was in touch with my older sister [Eunita Flemings Johnson] and Cathy had found out from her, from some--oh, from a television researcher in Canada, in the City of Toronto, that her grandfather [Gordon Anderson Abbott] was indeed a black man and had been a very successful prominent black man and her grandfather had been a very successful and prominent physician there and they did a story on it and she ended up writing a book of how she felt finding out at age fifty, fifty-one that she was indeed black and since then she's been in touch with her family and with us, and when I was with the Department of Cultural Affairs [City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs; City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events], we used to have a program which would be called, Conversations for Extraordinary People--with Extraordinary People [Conversations with Extraordinary People] and we would have a Chicagoan interview someone who had just published a book and her book was just about, just coming out then.  So we had [HistoryMaker] Ronne Hartfield, who is a woman here in Chicago [Illinois], who's quite well known and had just written her own family history, interviewed Cathy and we had a big program at the cultural center [Chicago Cultural Center, Chicago, Illinois], well not actually at the cultural center, through the cultural center but at another venue, we had that program and it was just an extraordinary program.  It was a conversation with two extraordinary women but that is, I think, a very unique part of a, of a story.  This would be our great-great possibly, great three, triple great uncle.
Speaker 1: Uncle, right, right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, so, yeah, it's, and the parallels, I think, are very interesting between Wilson and James, if indeed it's ever authenticated, and I'm not sure how you do it at that point but there are not an awful lot of stories of two free men from Virginia, move into Tuscaloosa and both accomplishing the same things, one in Tuscaloosa and one in Toronto.  I think what has always baffled me since I've known this story is, did they ever get back in touch with each other.  But then, if it's true, all of us have been in touch and we're still in touch with Cathy and that branch of that family.
Story_ID: 643321
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your father's side of the family.
Speaker 2: I know so little about my father's side of the family.
Speaker 1: Well, give us his name and his date of birth and place of birth (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.  His name is Amos Mcfarlane Flemings [Amos Flemings].  He was born February 2nd and we've since found out it was 1912, which is a little story I'll tell you in a minute.  He was born in Montgomery [Alabama].  As far as I, he was one of three.  His brother, Joseph [Joseph Flemings], died when I think daddy was seven, six or seven.  His mother [Louella Flemings Pruitt] died when he was, maybe the next year or so and he had a sister, Willa [Willa Flemings], who was older and she had already left and moved to New York.  So when his brother died and his mother died, he was orphaned.  So at age nine or ten, he just decided on his own he would, picked himself up and moved himself to Mobile [Alabama] and actually reared himself.  He was quite extraordinary.
Speaker 1: At ten years old?
Speaker 2: At ten years old.  I didn't, I have since found out it wasn't that unusual at that point, you know.  Times were very different back in the early decades of the 1900s but he did and, of course, families adopted families, you know, black families adopted children and not even legally.  They just took them under their wings and reared them and that's pretty much how he finished high school, became an avid, avid, avid and very, very good bridge player and started traveling the bridge circuit in the southeastern part of the United States and I think that's how he got to Chicago [Illinois].  His first trip to Chicago was that he ended up coming here to play in a bridge tournament, I think it was called the, it was an all-black bridge tournament.  I forget the name of the group but he played and he fell in love with Chicago and went back to Mobile, married, found my mother [Ella Peters Flemings], they met, dances, they like to tell the story, danced to 'Stardust,' fell in love and got married and after a couple of years he said, "No, we're moving, you got too much family and you're all too close."  So they all moved, he and my, he said, "We're moving and taking our--," we didn't, we weren't born yet, he said, "We're going to rear our family in Chicago," and she came here with him and fell in love with the city.
Story_ID: 643322
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now your mo- your mother [Ella Peters Flemings] was a very good bridge player also?
Speaker 2: She was.  As a matter of fact, and they both taught me to play, neither of my two sisters [Eunita Flemings Johnson and Maxine Flemings Leftwich] play so when they both passed away, I inherited all of their trophies.  They had several trophies, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now I read somewhere where your mother was one of the first women to win a tournament with the American Bridge Association (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Bridge Association.  Where did you win--read that?  That's I forgot that.  Yes, she was, she was, she was, and after we were grown and after I married my husband [Lynn Small], as I said, neither of my sisters played, one started to play a little bit now, but after I married my husband, who's also a very good bridge player, the four of us would sit down and play a lot and that's when I would hear these stories.
Speaker 1: Now that's not a game that you really think about in terms of black families or--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, there was a big black bridge circuit in Atlanta [Georgia] and Mobile [Alabama] in the Southeast and in Chicago [Illinois], big black bridge circuit.  I remember daddy [Amos Flemings] talking about the 57th Street bridge club which was not a place but a club and I think many of the people lived in that area, on 57th and Calumet [Avenue] and that would be in the very early to mid-'30s [1930s], I think, and maybe '40s [1940s].  Anyway, he would, that's, there was, and there was a place.  I guess there was a place on 57th Street where they would go and play.  It later moved to 87th Street, around Dante [Avenue], and it was still called the 57th Street bridge club and af- my mother died before my father and one of the things we encouraged him to do was to go back to his bridge playing and maybe he would bump into some of his old bridge buddies, and he did, and he started playing and he was excited to find the 57th Street bridge club that was still operating and a couple of his old buddies were still there.  Yeah, she was, she was good, he was, he was better.  He was also very serious, which is probably why my sisters don't play.  He didn't want anybody to talk.  When you play bridge, you play bridge, you know, the old fashion way.  You play bridge, you play bridge, you don't have the radio going, you don't talk and you don't do that, but yeah, he was pretty much self-made and he was a union organizer.
Story_ID: 643323
Speaker 1: I want to get back to that, I want to get into his [Small's father, Amos Flemings] father.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, I don't know his father.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know anything about his father and he didn't talk about it very much.  He doted a lot on my mother's [Ella Peters Flemings] family and, so there are a lot of questions I had about him but he died, about his fam- family.  I did know his aunt--his sister [Willa Flemings], my aunt, in New York but I didn't know much about his father and I, less about his mother [Louella Flemings Pruitt].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you said he was a union organizer.  What industry was he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) AFL-CIO [American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations], AFL-CIO.
Speaker 1: And what year was--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, that's not true, UAW [United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America; United Automobile Workers], I'm sorry, UAW, back when I was a little girl, so that would be in the mid-'40s [1940s], mid-'40s [1940s], '44 [1944] to '50 [1950] and then after that, he was ver- always involved but he worked very hard at that.  It was a strange time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So was he in an auto plant here in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, there were professional union organizers--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --offices.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they just organized union (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They organized unions, it was a big deal.  It was a big movement with the UAW.  Back then it was the labor movement.
Speaker 1: Did you get a sense that he, was he trying to organize unions generally or was he trying to get blacks in the unions or do you know?
Speaker 2: Both.
Speaker 1: Both?
Speaker 2: Both, both, both.  My father rarely did anything that didn't, I mean, he was trying to organize unions 'cause unions were trying to be org- were getting organized then and once he organized them, yes, getting blacks into unions.  He was very racial con- racially conscious so he did very little that wouldn't uplift his own people or take steps forward with them.
Speaker 1: And was he primarily in Chicago or did he move out, throughout the Midwest?
Speaker 2: You know I think it was primarily in Chicago but it was in Chicago, Chicagoland, the Chicago metropolitan area so it may have been Gary [Indiana], it may have been Joliet [Illinois], it may have been larger cities, not the suburbs because the suburbs weren't that established back then so it would have been larger cities around Chicago, Peoria [Illinois], not Peoria, that's too far, Joliet, Gary, northwest Indiana.
Speaker 1: Did he ever tell you about problems he had in terms of resistance to unions?
Speaker 2: No.  He really protected us from that and I sometimes know that there was just a lot of anger and a lot of pushback from companies but I can't even begin to repeat any specifics to you 'cause he really didn't talk about it that much.  I do remember him saying that there was a very liberal element, politically liberal element among the union organizers and I remember my mother [Ella Peters Flemings] laughingly saying, "Yes, socialism," but, and he would always say things like, "Yes, well that's not my goal.  My goal is to get unions organized and then, you know, I'm not in it for political reasons," but, yeah.
Speaker 1: Where did he work?
Speaker 2: He worked, well, he worked as a labor organizer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that was his job (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And that was downtown.  That was his job for many years.  Then, when he got three, had three children who were up and coming, he really did take a laborer's, a role at, as a laborer at General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company].
Speaker 1: And did he do, was that the end of his union organizing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, sort of, but I think he probably did it on the job and at the, at General Motors, I'm sure he did.  I'm sure he did it, yeah, but not, it was not his employment anymore.
Story_ID: 643324
Speaker 1: Now you grew up in Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Washington Park?  Is it called Washington Park or Washington Heights?  I grew, I was born at 61st [Street]--62nd [Street] and Langley [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And what was your household like?  I mean, you've got a mother [Ella Peters Flemings] who's playing bridge.  You've got a father [Amos Flemings] who's a union organizer.  You've got a long history of entrepreneurs in your family.  What was your family environment like?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my immediate family?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: There were the five of us (laughter).  The extended family was in other cities.  They had lots of friends, they had a lot of professional friends, they played bridge with those friends, they played a little poker on weekends.  A lot of their friends were dentists, doctors and lawyers and they would get together on weekends and that's how we could get to know the children of these friends and, you know, back then you did a lot at home.  You had a lot of entertaining done at home.  You've had dinner parties with, people would bring children but we were really just the five of us, my mother and father and their three daughters [Small and her sisters, Eunita Flemings Johnson and Maxine Flemings Leftwich].
Speaker 1: Where, what street did you live on?
Speaker 2: 62nd and Langley.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm in a three bedroom apartment, two, three bedroom apartment and living room, dining room, kitchen.  We stayed there from the time--and I know they moved there in May.  I was born in September 'cause my father used to say, "You know, you were the first African American," well, he'd say black then, Negro, "born in this area."  I don't think he knew that for a fact, I think he just calculated that we moved there in May and you were born in September, how many babies could have been born so I don't know even if it's accurate but I'm, we lived there until 1952 when they bought a house and moved to Chatham [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: And what was the name of the hospital you were born in?
Speaker 2: I was born at Provident [Provident Hospital; Provident Hospital of Cook County, Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 643325
Speaker 1: And what was the neighborhood [Washington Park, Chicago, Illinois] like?
Speaker 2: Oh, we were just talking about that the other day, it was wonderful.  If you know Chicago's [Chicago, Illinois] history, you know that 60th [Street] to 63rd [Street], Cottage Grove [Avenue] to what was then South Park [South Parkway], now King Drive [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive], was considered, it was the place where Earl B. Dickerson did all the work on his house- housing covenant, did all of the legal work and open housing was a big product.  That was the area that was closed and as soon as it opened up, many people moved in.  The school, public school was A.O. Sexton [Austin O. Sexton Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].  The neighborhood was very established with professional and working, hard working class black folks.  Everybody knew everyone, everybody knew everybody's child.  Every mot- many mothers, including mine, knew half of the faculty at the public, at the elementary school and you rode your bikes everywhere, yeah.  It was, it was very, it was a wonderful neighborhood to grow up in.  And then you grow up and you go to college [Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois] and you find out that your husband [Lynn Small] grew up five blocks from you and your sister's husband grew up six blocks from you and at one point, my brother-in-law says that someone out in California said to him, "You know you're the tenth person I know--I've met who told me that they grew up in that neighborhood.  Boy that place produced a lot of successful black people," and, of course, we, "How did you all end up there," and we said, "We were forced to live in certain blocks" and by then it was 60--well I guess south of that was always, always black, from 63rd to 68th Street.
Speaker 1: So that was almost the South Shore [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No, no, 'cause we're talking east, I mean west of Cottage Grove.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) South Shore is east of, east.  We're talking Cottage Grove to King Drive.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, you know, you almost knew it by, and a little bit over, over to State Street, too, because Betsy Ross [Betsy Ross Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] was a black school, a black elementary school.  So Calumet [Avenue] and Prairie [Avenue] and Indiana [Avenue], Michigan [Avenue] and Wabash [Avenue], so there were, but it was a very strange little jogging, gerrymandering we called it but everybody, and if you, if you meet somebody now, oh, where'd you go to elementary school or where'd you go to high school, you almost invariably know the same people if you're in the same age group.
Speaker 1: Now was, was your mother [Ella Peters Flemings] and father [Amos Flemings] aware of the restrictive covenants in the area at that time?
Speaker 2: Very much so.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, very much so.
Speaker 1: Did they talk to you about that or your sisters [Eunita Flemings Johnson and Maxine Flemings Leftwich]?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, and he'd start, he would start off by saying, telling, telling me why he thought I was the only, the first black child born in that area and then he would talk about what Earl B. Dickerson had done in a little interesting by--sideline, side story.  Many years later, I was talking with my, with the head of the department where I worked at cultural affairs [City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs; City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events], Lois Weisberg, and we were talking about that whole open housing covenant and that whole lawsuit and I was saying to her, well, "Lois, you may not know who Earl B. Dickerson is," and she looked at me and she smiled and she said, "Joan [HistoryMaker Joan Small], not only did I know who Earl B. Dickerson is, was," and she's several years older than I am, she said, "but I also knew him."  She said, "My father [Mortimer Porges], my father gave him office space in the Loop [Chicago, Illinois] when no one would rent to him," and she said, and I remember on at least two occasions when they traveled by train to Springfield [Illinois] when Dickerson was working on this lawsuit and this legal approach, she said they checked into a, tried to check into a hotel and he, Earl B. Dickerson wasn't allowed to check in and she said, "My father stepped up and said, he has to be here tomorrow, he has to check in," and they said, "We're sorry, we don't allow blacks to stay in this, or Negroes to stay in this hotel."  So he, her father said, "Fine, fine," then she said, "That's okay, Earl, it's okay" and they walked outside and waited 'til everybody got to sleep and so he brought him up to his room and he stayed there a few times which was a really interesting story when you combine the old and the new.
Speaker 1: Now that was the Hansberry lawsuit [Hansberry v. Lee, 1940]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, 1941 [sic.].
Speaker 1: Nineteen forty-one [1941], yeah, and that went all the way up to the [U.S.] Supreme Court.
Speaker 2: It--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, um-hm.  Yeah, actually the Hansberrys were in the neighborhood, they were on 62nd [Street] and, if I'm not mistaken, Rhodes [Avenue], 'cause Lorraine Hansberry was, and Perry [Perry Hansberry, Jr.] were in my class.
Speaker 1: Oh, they were?
Speaker 2: One was in my class, was it Perry?  No, Lorraine was in my sister's class, Perry was in my class, um-hm.  This was their aunt [Lorraine Hansberry], I believe, or their, was it their parent, no I think it was their aunt, their father's [Perry Hansberry, Sr.] brother, I mean, sister.
Speaker 1: We know Lorraine Hansberry from 'Raisin in the Sun' ['A Raisin in the Sun'].
Speaker 2: Right, right, but this is her niece--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I'm talking about.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Lorraine Hansberry was not, was, this is her father's, this is Lorraine's brother's daughter--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --who was named after her aunt.
Story_ID: 643326
Speaker 1: What was the name of your elementary school?
Speaker 2: A.O. Sexton [Austin O. Sexton Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: And your high school was?
Speaker 2: I, we moved to Chatham [Chicago, Illinois] so my high school was--Park Manor [Chicago, Illinois] and Chatham, my high school was Hirsch [Hirsch High School; Emil G. Hirsch Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Hirsch, okay.  And what kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: A good one, pretty good one, pretty good.  I got a double promotion in elementary school and, which is, you know, everybody bragged about and as I got older, I said to everyone, "Yeah, it was wonderful, it was flattering, it was, meant that I was really a bright kid."  It also meant that I didn't learn percentages so thank goodness for calculators and I graduated from Hirsch, went downstate for three years and hated it, at the third year and transferred to Roosevelt [Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois] and--
Speaker 1: You went to the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I got down there, it was pretty bad.  You know it wasn't, it was all hidden but you--
Speaker 1: Covert?
Speaker 2: Exactly, very covert, so much so that I remember when I was a freshman or second semester freshman, I was popular in my dorm and I remember being selected to run for snowball queen and I called my mother [Ella Peters Flemings], all excited.  I was, it was, the snowball queen at the University of Illinois was the, was the queen of all the independent dorms.  So in other words, there was a sorority lifestyle and an independent lifestyle and I didn't want to pledge a sorority so I was living in a, in a dormitory and it was pretty much white, as you can imagine and I called home excited that I needed a dress for, to run for snowball queen and you're going to be crowned, I didn't know whether I was going to win.  I had to campaign and so forth and so on and you get crowned at this big formal dance so I needed a dress for this dance and so forth and my mother was excited and she said, "Oh, that's great.  We'll come down or you can come home and we'll pick something," so forth.  Two days later the phone rang and it was my father [Amos Flemings] who said, "Hold your, hold your horses," and I said, "What?"  He said, "Tell me what you have to do," and I said, "Oh, you have to campaign, you have to make all kinds of posters and put them all over the campus and, and you have to go around in different dorms and so forth and so on," and he said, "You're not going, you're not doing this," and I was crushed.  I said, "What?"  He said, "I'm not going to allow you to do this," and I said, in tears, "What's the matter," and he said, "No daughter of mine, no brown skinned daughter of mine is going to run for something called snowball queen in southern Illinois," and within two years I knew exactly what he was, he was saying, you know, he was very wise.  He was an extremely wise man and he said, "I know it hurts now but you'll understand one day."  Within two years I did, actually sooner than that, when I started seeing, he said, "Now just think about it, Joan [HistoryMaker Joan Small].  The posters will be marked up, this will happen, that will," and it did.  It started happening all over.  So, that was in the late '50s [1950s], by the way.
Speaker 1: What year did you start there?
Speaker 2: I started college in '59 [1959].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: January '59 [1959].
Speaker 1: How many black students were at U of I at that time?
Speaker 2: I don't know if I can give you a number.  I think it was probably, I would guess, 4 or 5 percent, very few, if that.  You know, there were, I lived in a, let me give you a ratio.  I lived in a dorm of about three hundred women and there were four, five of us.  There were sorority and fraternity houses.  The Deltas [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority] had a house.  AKAs [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority] were just opening a house.  Kappas [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity] did not have--the only fraternity actually was the Alphas [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity], I mean, the Kappas.  They had a house, Alphas didn't but lifestyles were very different.
Story_ID: 643327
Speaker 1: Want to step back to your high school for just a second.  Did you have any favorite teachers or teachers that really influenced you at that time?
Speaker 2: High school at Hirsch [Hirsch High School; Emil G. Hirsch Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois] was very difficult.  I went there when Hirsch was, when Chatham [Chicago, Illinois] and Park Manor [Chicago, Illinois] were going through racial changes.  We were the first blacks on our block and within maybe a three or four block radius so we had windows broken all the time and we had very nasty writings on our garage door and daddy [Amos Flemings] would go to work and my mother [Ella Peters Flemings], or would go off doing something on weekends working on his labor organizing, I'm sure, that or back in the early '50s [1950s] and we would get really, things scratched on the, on the, on the pavement in the alley, paint thrown on the garage door, just some defacing and vandalism and Hirsch also was very similar.  It was very covert, though.  You knew you couldn't join the senior choir.  The only thing blacks were allowed to do was to join the girls chor- girls chorus.  You couldn't even join the junior choir.  You couldn't be a cheerleader.  You could play basketball and football but nobody could cheer for you.  There were the Hirsch aquatic aces which was the swimming, synchronized swimming team, actually, and it was, they won all kinds of awards.  They were so busy with that that no one taught you how to swim, if you didn't know how to swim, and the guidance counselor, Mrs. Kestenbaum [ph.], I'll never forget her name, didn't have time for the black students.  You know, ma- many of us, of course, had educated parents so we didn't need her to guide us through college prep work or college applications but if we did, or if you did, you were lost.  So I had very few favorite teachers at Hirsch.  You sort of fought your way through and, but you learned good lessons.  I learned one lesson, one political lesson.  We weren't allowed to hold office in most of the extracurricular activities and I joined, you joined what organizations you could because, of course, you know, you needed to have that for your college application.  So you joined extracurricular organizations and I had no, never had any intention of being a teacher but I joined Future Teachers of America 'cause that's the one they let black kids in.  So I was there and one day they were looking for, we were electing officers and as I say, you join, there were obviously a number of black young women then in FTA, Future Teachers of America, so we had our own little political lesson.  We were trying to elect officers and all of a sudden I got nominated to be president of Future Teachers of America without anybody talking to me, so I was sort of shocked, and then another friend across the way was nominated to be vice president and then another black person, I quickly caught on by the way, another black person nominated a white classmate.  I nominated another white classmate so it was the old story of if you nominate enough people and you break up the vote and I got elected.  That was the political lessons you learned at age sixteen because of ugliness but they serve you well in years to come.
Speaker 1: Now were your sisters there also?
Speaker 2: No.  My younger sister [Maxine Flemings Leftwich], yes.  My younger sister actually entered, my older sister [Eunita Flemings Johnson] wasn't.  She was three, two years ahead of me in school and we had, she had already started high school when my parents moved so she stayed at Englewood [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois], much to my parents' chagrin, but she stayed there 'cause she only had a year and half left to go but my younger sister was exactly four years behind me in school so the day I graduated from Hirsch, she graduate, she entered, she entered Hirsch, graduated from elementary school and entered the next Monday.  So, yeah, and she had a totally different experience, totally different, because the neighborhood in those three, four years just turned over, completely turned over, racially.  So when she was, when I was at Hirsch, I think there, we were 15 percent, 10--by the time I graduated, we were 10, 15 percent of the class and by the time she graduated, it was almost 100 percent, maybe 90.
Speaker 1: So the neighborhood just went--
Speaker 2: Neighborhood turned over (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) almost overnight?
Speaker 2: --instantly, instantly.  That was the home of all of Chicago's fire department and police department.  It was a very good, strong Irish neighborhood.  People moved west and they moved south.  Park Manor and Chatham just turned, really, within three years.
Story_ID: 643328
Speaker 1: Now we were just talking about, you know, the neighborhood and Hirsch High School [Emil G. Hirsch Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois] and how the neighborhood [Chatham, Chicago, Illinois] had really started changing by the time that you graduated and you were saying that when your sister [Small's younger sister, Maxine Flemings Leftwich] got there, things had already almost turned over in the--
Speaker 2: Racially, um-hm, um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) area.  When you were there, were there any black teachers at all?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't think there was.  Somewhere along the line there might have been one but I'm hard pressed to really tell you that, tell you, answer that, yes.  I don't remember any and I remember struggling so much that when you asked me who was my favorite teacher in high school, I can't begin to tell you.  I can tell you very quickly who my favorite teacher was in elementary school, and she's very well known, it's Madeline Stratton [HistoryMaker Madeline Stratton Morris].
Speaker 1: What grade was that?
Speaker 2: She taught sixth grade, history, and she was, she's actually been recognized, nationally, but really, really recognized in the state, and the organization's named after her.  She taught African American history, she taught black history.  Back then, we had Negro History Week [Black History Month] and she made sure every one of her students knew their history and knew their background and she stretched it into a month program and everybody who had her at Sexton school [Austin O. Sexton Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] just got to know their own history.  She was really, and as I say, she's the, she, there are organizations named after her.  She's in history books and has gotten many, many statewide awards and honors.
Speaker 1: Now what grade did Sexton go up to?
Speaker 2: It was kindergarten through eighth.
Story_ID: 643329
Speaker 1: So when you knew you were going to Hirsch [Hirsch High School; Emil G. Hirsch Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois], did you know what the environment was going to be there?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't think so 'cause I don't think I knew that there was, that what the environment, I didn't know what the neighborhood was like.  I did know that, one, two, three of my very close friends who were in my graduating class at Hirsch, were also, I mean, at Sexton [Austin O. Sexton Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], were also going to Hirsch.  So it was fine.  You know, my very close friends, there were four of us who got double promotions together and we were all good students and we, and one boy and two girls.  And, so we actually all ended up going to Hirsch.
Speaker 1: What kind of grades did you get at Hirsch?
Speaker 2: Mainly Bs, solid Bs, a couple of A's here and there, C every now and then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were overcoming a lot just to get good grades.  Did you find that the teachers were giving you, were grading you differently (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I didn't find, I don't, I don't think I found the grading discriminatory.  I found the aca- the extracurricular, the atmosphere, very discriminatory.  I'm sure, looking back on it as an adult in a form of social worker, that, yes, of course that affects you.  Of course you have, you have a lot of difficulty but, yeah, no, I didn't feel that I had any, I didn't feel that I had to work harder to get the same grades, if that's what you're asking, yeah.  No, I didn't, 'cause I had good grades and I was considered one of the, you know, I was in National Honor [National Honor Society] and I was considered one of the students who was a su- a successful student but it, you, of course, in high school, you have to have good grades to get in extracurricular activities to participate in some things and they were never good enough, even though they were good, they were never good enough, so--
Speaker 1: So when you say that, you know, you couldn't get into certain extracurricular activities, was it, did they just tell you, you can't, you can't get into this organization?
Speaker 2: We're full, we're full, your grades aren't good enough, we have no openings until next September, we have no openings then and I must say, back then, you knew which ones you tried out for and you knew what your limits were and you didn't always push them.  We were pretty bold in that Future Teachers of America effort.  Let's face it.  We were really very bold.  Most sixteen year olds don't take those kinds of steps and we knew we were, we were risking things but by then, I think because there's strength in numbers in that particular organization, there were a number of blacks so we knew we could do that but if you went to the senior choir or some of the other, the science, what was it called?  Whatever the science activity was, you just knew that you didn't--
Speaker 1: There was kind of--
Speaker 2: --you didn't, you didn't approach it.  You just didn't go.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You didn't try, you didn't try to join.
Speaker 1: Now the Future Teachers--did you stay in that all year, all the years you were at Hirsch?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh, no, not all the years.  This happened in maybe in my, I actually think it was maybe my junior year.  Was it my junior year? But I stayed in it all the way till I graduated, and maybe not my last semester, but, yeah, I had stopped playing games by then.
Story_ID: 643330
Speaker 1: Now you knew you were going to go to college at that point (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did you have any sense of--I mean, you ended up at the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], was that the place you really wanted to go?
Speaker 2: It was a place I wanted to go.
Speaker 1: Not where your parents wanted you to go?
Speaker 2: You know, my mother [Ella Peters Flemings] kept talking about the Seven Sisters.  She wanted us to go out east.  My father [Amos Flemings] kept saying there are three girls to educate, that's, unless one of them gets a scholarship, that's a big chunk.  She then wanted, she wanted my older sister [Eunita Flemings Johnson] to go to Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], she didn't.  I think I was okay with going to the University of Illinois 'cause all of my buddies from Hirsch [Hirsch High School; Emil G. Hirsch Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois] were going and we all applied together and we all went and took the SATs together down at Navy Pier [Chicago, Illinois] and we all went, the three of us, three of us, four, no, three of us, went off to college together so, but you--these are friends who were, these were people who were friends from elementary school [Austin O. Sexton Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] and you clung together under those circumstances that I described at Hirsch.  So you were supporting, one of them I'm still very close to.  He's a professor at USC [University of Southern California] out in California [Los Angeles, California] and we talk all the time but, yeah, it's, there's a, there's a strong support, there was a strong support system.  So I was fine with going to the University of Illinois 'cause by then I, I do know that I told my parents, "I don't want to go to a black college."  I do know I said that and I think my mother was crushed, my father wasn't thrilled but my mother was crushed.  "What do you mean you don't want to go to Spelman but how about going east?  I thought I might send you out east," and I may have applied, I don't even remember.
Speaker 1: So why did you not want to go to a black college (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A black college?  You know, I graduated in 19--late 1950s so the black pride hadn't gotten full swing.  I was hearing fairly negative things about black colleges.  I didn't think I'd get the same education.  Even though my mother had told me how wrong I was, even though she said, "You can't get a better education than Spelman," and I, and I also wasn't sure it was true any longer.  I knew it was true when she was there.  I knew it was a fine school then, I wasn't hearing great things about it when I was ready to go off to college and back then, Illinois was a good school.
Speaker 1: Now this is, maybe a few years after the Montgomery Bus Boycott?  Were you influenced by that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, no, it wasn't, it was before the Montgomery Bus Boycott.
Speaker 1: I thought you said it was '59 [1959]?
Speaker 2: When was the boycott?
Speaker 1: Fifty-five [1955].
Speaker 2: Was it '55 [1955]?  I was thinking it was '61 [1961].  No, it was '55 [1955].
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Fifty-six [1956].
Speaker 2: Fifty-six [1956] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Fifty-six [1956].
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now I'm sorry, I lost your question.
Speaker 1: I was going to ask you, were you influenced by that in terms of your concern about going to school?
Speaker 2: No, it really, I really wasn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was really more the academics.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I really didn't, rightly or wrongly, I think I didn't consider it as good an education and I think I look back on it, and I think it was probably wrong but I think I'm not sure that that wasn't, that was the school for me.
Speaker 1: Did you talk to any of your, did any of your friends go to any HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities]?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, some relatives did but, you know, in the '50s [1950s], the move, the mode was breaking out, integrating.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, fighting your way through those systems to integrate.  That was what that was all about and as hard as that was, you know, I don't, and I can't tell you whether I think it was a good, right or a wrong decision, I really, mainly 'cause I really don't know what kind of school Spelman was then, in the late '50s [1950s].  One of our best friends later became president of Spelman and he just thinks it's always been wonderful but I tease him and tell him that's what you're supposed to say.
Speaker 1: Who was that?
Speaker 2: Don Stewart [Donald M. Stewart].
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't know that.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah, I said, you're supposed to say that, you were, you were their president for ten years.
Speaker 1: My wife actually worked for him--
Speaker 2: Did she?
Speaker 1: --at Chicago State [Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Oh, at Chicago State?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He's never been at Chicago State.  University of Illin- University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know she, I know she worked for him at, was associated with him at some point.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he left Chicago [Illinois] and just came back ten years ago.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 643331
Speaker 1: Now you talked about your experience at the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois].  Did any of your friends that you come there with your little, your little--
Speaker 2: My little clique?
Speaker 1: Your clique.  Did they leave also or did they stay there?
Speaker 2: The, both of them stayed.  One graduated, both of them graduated, both of them graduated.  One of the, the guy graduate, Joseph Pruitt [ph.] was his name, Joe graduated and ended up going to Case Western [Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio] for graduate school and a Ph.D. and the other one, Barbara [ph.], graduated and went on to get a master's in nursing from, I'm not sure where, it wasn't Illinois, but somewhere.
Speaker 1: Now was your major sociology at that point?
Speaker 2: My major was sociology and psychology, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And what made you decide to go to Roosevelt [Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois]?  I mean, why Roosevelt (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Why Roosevelt?  Because, it's funny, because I came home for the summer and I had decided that I really didn't want to take two science courses that were requirements for graduation and I understood that if I, that Roosevelt had a summer program that was a six week summer program and I realized I could go and take physical science one and two and I could get, take them both and each one of them was six weeks.  So I told my parents [Ella Peters Flemings and Amos Flemings], "I think I'll go there, spend my summer getting rid of those courses and I can do anything for six week, for two, for two six week sessions and then I can transfer those credits," and when I got there, the environment was so much better.  It was so free and so liberal and the one thing I wasn't sure about was living at home 'cause I'd been away at school all this time, so the one thing I wasn't sure about was going to school at home but I just stayed and I told them, I said, "I don't want to go back downstate, I really don't," and, of course, they hit the roof, "You're not going to get your degree after all this from the University of Illinois?  What do you mean you're going to get a degree from Roosevelt," and then I met my husband [Lynn Small] so everything was fine.  He was a graduate student.  He had left, he had gone to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] from age, I think from sixth grade all the way up through college and decided he wanted to do some graduate work at Roosevelt, so he was a Lab School [University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois] brat and high school brat and so forth but, yeah, it's a, and I met him there and maybe that was the, I didn't meet him though until after I enrolled permanently, until, until it was the fall, that's when I started noticing him.  So I didn't see him at all over that summer.  So I can't even say he's the reason that I decided to stay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, it's true.  I didn't even know he existed until after I decided to stay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when did you actually meet him?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  We met, I graduated '63 [1963], we met in '61 [1961], it must have been sixty--no, we got married in '62 [1962].  We met in '61 [1961], so I went to school in '58 [1958], I guess, and we met and we met because he was walking through the lunchroom and I was in the lunchroom between courses and I just did this and said, "Who was that," and someone said, "Oh, he's that really brilliant political science graduate student that everybody, that doesn't have much time for anybody else."  So we found time for each other.
Speaker 1: And you graduated from Roosevelt in, was it--
Speaker 2: You know, we got married my last, my last, '64 [1964], we got married in my last year, much to my parents' chagrin, so I didn't go that one year and my father was raising all kinds of--saying and he kept saying to my husband, "She's not going to finish school.  She's not going to finish school.  She's going to have children, you're going to be, that's going to be it.  All of this is going to be wasted, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah," and my husband looked at my father and said, "No, don't worry, she'll finish," and he said, "You'll make sure of it?"  He said, "I don't want an uneducated wife, she'll finish."  (Laughter) So I did.  I went back and finished and to make my father happy, I put my degree in my maiden name and handed it to him so that (laughter), 'cause he was so sure I was not going to finish, but I took a year off and that was when he started, just knew I wasn't going to finish.
Story_ID: 643332
Speaker 1: What kind of work did your husband do?  Did he, he finished his graduate work there?
Speaker 2: He finished his graduate work and then he, it was the war, it was the Vietnam War, and everybody was being drafted and the only way you could, one of the ways you could not be drafted is if you were a teacher.  So he stopped what he was going to do to, went into education and taught for two years.  He wasn't wild about it but he taught for two years and at the end of those two years, I think it was '65 [1965], maybe it was '64 [1964].  When did Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] die?  Sixty-four [1964]?
Speaker 1: Sixty-three [1963].
Speaker 2: Sixty-three [1963] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sixty-three [1963].
Speaker 2: Sixty-three [1963], before he died, he passed an executive order so it was in '63 [1963].  He passed an executive order that married men did not, could not be drafted.  They had to go to the bottom of the draft list and so then he was able to leave that and he started, I forget where he worked then, but his field is advertising.  He ended up going to Leo Burnett [Leo Burnett Company Inc.] in '67 [1967] and then stayed in advertising all the way up until he retired.
Speaker 1: Where did he teach?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy.  He taught at Betsy Ross [Betsy Ross Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].  You know, he was a substitute teacher.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: So he was just filling in and literally marking time so that he wasn't going to, he was, he was opposed to the war, didn't want to go to war, didn't believe in fighting that war but the process for conscientious objection was really not easy and not simple and he was really draft worthy and draft, and at the top of the list so, until Kennedy passed that order.  So the quickest way to not fight that war rather then was to start teaching.  You know, when I say he didn't like it, it wasn't, he liked it, it was fun but it was not a career for him.
Speaker 1: Right.  Did he, what was his graduate work in?
Speaker 2: Political science.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And he went from that to advertising?
Speaker 2: To advertising, um-hm, um-hm.  There's not much you can do with a graduate degree in adver- in political science.  He uses a name out of the past that you probably don't remember and probably too young to remember, Norm Spaulding [Norman W. Spaulding III].  Norm Spaulding was a, sort of iconic person in Chicago [Illinois].  He had a radio show, he was in radio sales, he was extremely well known, well respected, very, very smart and Norm was a friend of my husband's from years back, Norm and his wife, Claire [ph.], and they lived in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois] and at the time adverti- there'd been some pressure on advertising agencies to start in the, in the mid-'60s [1960s] to start looking at how you can include blacks in advertising and in order to do that you need to get some on your staff because, mainly on the creative side of the, of that industry, but then if you have them on the creative side, you've also got to have them on the account side to service those accounts or to service, service that end of the account.  Anyway, Norm pushed and was pushing J. Walter Thompson and Leo Burnett and I think Foote, Cone and Belding at the same time to do some, to get blacks on their staff and he tapped Lynn [Lynn Small] on the shoulder and he said, "You fit this perfectly."  He said, "You've got the mind for it, the personality for it and the brains for it, and it's very tricky."  So he ended up going into advertising and actually after a couple of years, taught a basic ad course at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] for other blacks to, that was a vehicle for, to introduce advertising to other blacks.
Speaker 1: Were there any blacks at Leo Burnett at that time?
Speaker 2: There were two.  There was Don Richards [HistoryMaker Donald C. Richards] and our very, still our very dear friend, [HistoryMaker] Stuart Rankin.  The three of them would, were there together.  There may have been one more.  There may have been one more but they all came individually.  They didn't all come at one time.  They came over a few years.
Speaker 1: Now was he an account exec [account executive] or was he on the creative side (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Account exec.  No, he was an account exec.
Speaker 1: He was an account exec.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, and at one point, for a year, each of these black guys rotated through the personnel department, which was a commitment that Leo Burnett had made that they wanted to recruit other blacks and the way to do it was to get, keep a black person in personnel to go out to black college, to, not black colleges [HBCUs] but to all colleges and to be on the lookout.  I mean, they did general, general recruiting as well but that was their, one of their charges.  So they each spent a year, a year and a half in personnel, a stint there to try and improve those statistics but then they went right back to the account work and he left there and went to United Airlines on a, you know how some, when you use the term account exec it sounds like you know that industry a little bit so they, clients always steal away their agent, their account folks, so he went to work for United.
Speaker 1: So he had U- United as an account?
Speaker 2: He worked on an account.  He really didn't have it as an account.  He had Speedy--no, Pillsbury [Pillsbury Company, LLC, Minneapolis, Minnesota], and Marlboro, as his accounts and, but he worked on a, there was some kind of a campaign that Leo Burnett was doing with United Airlines and he worked on that as part of, and when they, and it was such a successful campaign, I think that's when they came up with their, "Our little corner of the world."  I think that's where that came from, this little thing they were doing, and I'm not sure why they were doing it 'cause it wasn't just black, it was, maybe they were pitching the account, come to think of it, but I'm not sure, but shortly after that, they picked up that whole little group that worked on that campaign and brought them all to United.
Story_ID: 643333
Speaker 1: Now where are you at this point?
Speaker 2: Where am I working?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: That would have been in, let's see, I was working at Metro- well, it's now called Metropolitan Family Services, it was then United Charities of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  It's the second largest family service agency in the country.  No, I was, yes, I, no, I wasn't.  In '67 [1967], was I doing that?
Speaker 1: When were you at--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Robert Taylor Homes [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I was there from, no, I was there from '64 [1964], you're right.  From '64 [1964] to late '68 [1968], I started at Metropolitan Family Services, January '69 [1969].  So, no, I was at Robert Taylor Homes then.  I was a social worker.  That was a special unit by the way.  It was, Cook County Department of Aid [Cook County Department of Public Aid], public aid casework but they had a special unit of trained social workers or trained people in the social service field who worked, were assigned to Robert Taylor.  Robert Taylor's, the approach to public housing project then was a combined one, you worked with a housing program, you worked with medical personnel and you worked with social service to try and bring services into Robert Taylor.
Speaker 1: Now Robert Taylor, how old was it at this point?
Speaker 2: It was new.  When did it open?  In the late '50s [1950s], early, was it the late '50s [1950s] or early '50s [1950s]?  It might have been the early '50 [1950], the mid-'50s [sic.].  It was, it was not old, it was not rundown but it deteriorated so rapidly, just rapidly.
Speaker 1: Now when you first started there, what was, was the racial makeup, you know, 90 percent black?  Were any whites living in Robert Taylor Homes?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, it wasn't built for whites.
Speaker 1: Oh, I know it wasn't but I just--
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh.  I think if I, if I had a caseload of fifty, sixty clients, I can't tell you I had a white client in the four and a half years I was there.
Speaker 1: And what was your, as a caseworker, what kind of things did you have to do?
Speaker 2: You made home visits.  Robert Taylor was different from regular public aid casework in that you made sure services were brought into public housing.  I later went on record at United Charities saying that I thought that was a big mistake because you isolated people from the rest of the world and the rest of the city but the idea was to bring services to people and to improve their lives by providing them if they, if mothers couldn't keep house, you would bring in housekeepers.  We taught them budgeting.  They could go for classes within Robert Taylor.  There were, and some of these classes were set up by the, what were they called, they were, they were the agents who worked for public housing.  They worked for CHA, for Chicago Housing Authority, and they worked directly with the caseworkers and with the medical staff and we would staff cases all the time.  So there were all kinds of services for them but I would see, I think I had a caseload of about fifty.  I'd say probably 60, 70 percent of it, single, single women, single parents, single female parents, but there were a number of cases where you would, they had unemployed fathers and they would receive aid, it was limit- time limited but they would receive aid and most of those intact families, as they were called then, were large families.  They would be mothers and fathers with six, eight, ten children and there was a, there were only two to three apartments per floor that had space for that and sometimes you, but you'd visit homes and make sure that there were, it was adequate furniture, adequate food, children were in school, they were learning and provide whatever, you know, and trying to establish a relationship with them so they would really be able to call you and tell you what they--their needs were.  The whole idea of Robert Taylor was terrible, though.
Story_ID: 643334
Speaker 1: Why do you say it was terrible?
Speaker 2: It's--in retrospect, I look back and I think Robert Taylor was built, where it was built to divide the city and I think you must have heard this before.  I would guess you've heard this.  It's always been a theory that Robert Taylor was built along the Dan Ryan [Expressway] because those became two natural barriers to keep black people on this side of the, of the City of Chicago [Illinois] and not west of the Dan Ryan.  So you build these sixteen story high rise buildings for twenty blocks and they run up and down a very large freeway and so people don't venture beyond that and what beyond that is Bridgeport [Chicago, Illinois] and beyond that was, that was Chinatown [Chicago, Illinois] then and then the southwest side, Englewood [Chicago, Illinois], which was all pretty white back then.  It didn't work, did it?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And you also mentioned that, you know, people didn't really have to go outside of Robert Taylor Homes [Chicago, Illinois] to get services?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Now why do you think, how did that affect--
Speaker 2: Why I said I think that was a mistake?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause I think it isolated people.  You didn't, I would run into so many clients where I would ask them, eventually I would ask them, I would run into so many people who really couldn't even, hadn't even ventured downtown.  I mean, if your, if your horizons are your immediate environment and your immediate environment is Robert Taylor and it never was good.  I mean, in fact that's not true.  The first few years it was good.  The first few years they moved in people who, it was a trial and they moved in people who had smaller families, better housing standards and they were, the idea was to make it, make them upwardly mobile and that, but then you, it became, you know, you tear down everything else around it so you begin to move in, cram people into high rise buildings and so then you have very limited horizons.
Speaker 1: Now you say you were there for four and, four and a half years?
Speaker 2: Four and a half years.  I started there in maybe October, November of, is that right?  I graduated [from Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois]--yeah, I started there sometime in the fall of '64 [1964] and I left there end, at the end of '68 [1968].  Yeah, I started there in, I think, I think I started in August of '64 [1964], if I'm not mistaken, and I left there in December of '68 [1968], took two weeks off and started at United Charities [United Charities of Chicago; Metropolitan Family Services, Chicago, Illinois] 1st of January.
Speaker 1: In terms of Robert Taylor, how many caseworkers were there?
Speaker 2: Our office must have had, oh, I guess, oh, this is a guess.  Maybe there were nine units, each one had five, I'd say maybe forty, anywhere between forty-five and sixty but they also had specialty caseworkers.  They had housing consultants and they had homemaker services and financial management workers, caseworkers.  So we could really avail ourselves of all kinds of specialty groups.
Speaker 1: Was there a big effort to move people out of Robert Taylor Homes or was the--
Speaker 2: On paper.
Speaker 1: On paper (laughter)?
Speaker 2: On paper (laughter), and then that was the idea, that it was, it was a steppingstone but it never happened.  It never happened.  So ironic because Robert Taylor's two daughters [HistoryMaker Lauranita Dugas and HistoryMaker Barbara Bowman] are our best friends and it's just, and they both, and their granddaughter [HistoryMaker Valerie Jarrett], and I'm sorry, and one of them, and his granddaughter, one of his grandchildren says, you know, it's a mixed blessing to have that project named after your grandfather or father.
Story_ID: 643335
Speaker 1: We were talking about Robert, Robert Taylor Homes [Chicago, Illinois]. What was the Daley's [Richard J. Daley] administration's, I guess, how did they see Robert Taylor Homes and did they try to use that as a vehicle for, say, generating votes or anything?
Speaker 2: I think they did use it as a vehicle for generating votes.  I think, well, he built it.
Speaker 1: I didn't know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So of course he loved it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And I think he built it for various reasons.  Let me preface this by saying that I'm very close to his son [Richard M. Daley] and worked for his son and his son appointed me to the position [with the City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs; City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events], and I think they're extremely different people.  He was, he built Robert Taylor, and I told you why I thought Robert Taylor, one of the reasons, it's not the reason it was built by any stretch.  I would never say there was any one reason but I certainly think that was a driving force and that was the mentality at the time but I never, if you're asking me did they see it as a place for getting votes, yes.  I would go into the district sometimes and I would see people who would have extra groceries or extra hams or extra turkeys in their apartments and I'd inquire, 'cause I knew their budget, their food budgets couldn't do it and, so, you know, sometime, initially you think, oh, a good fam- nice family member, sometimes a boyfriend and I was not the kind of caseworker that begrudged women relationships at all.  I thought that was their personal business but, so I thought, maybe somebody had dropped something off and then, oh, no, Mr. So and So came.  So it was the precinct worker or the so forth, you know, they, yes, they would push for votes by buying groceries.  The other thing that was often said that I personally never saw, never experienced was that there, that the workers in the offices were campaign workers.  No, I never saw that.  I would see, on occasion, a couple of clerical workers during election time who would be off but they were work--paid to be judges at the polls.  They were not campaigning and soliciting votes, and I personally never experienced it and none of my friends did.  I would never say it didn't happen, I am just saying it did not happen in our office and maybe our office was unique.  I'm not naive.  I mean, I was in city government too long to be naive and things were worse back then but it was not a prerequisite for work and, for your job at all and I, you know, our casework just continued.
Speaker 1: Who was the alderman in that area when you were there?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  Who was it?  I'm trying to think what ward it was.  You know, I don't know.  I don't know.  I lived in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois] at the time.  Let's see, who was the alderman?  Dawson [William L. Dawson] was, wasn't Dawson the congressman then?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Yeah.
Speaker 2: And, but I can't remember who the alderman was.
Speaker 1: The whole complex was in one ward though, wasn't it?
Speaker 2: No, I think it was in two, wasn't it?  Yeah, Robert Taylor ran from 31st Street [sic. Pershing Road] to 54th [Street], it's the last building, was the last thing before you got to, what was the Schulze Baking Company [Chicago, Illinois] on 55th [Street].  Okay, so it ran all the way up to the north end of that.  So I think 5419, 5429 [Federal Street] may have been addresses of those last two buildings.  So that's a long, that's more than twenty blocks.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And wards that I think were going this way, and whoever was the alderman at one point may not have been by the time it was torn down because, you know, those wards got gerrymandered a lot.  That was the 2nd Ward, no, it wasn't the 2nd Ward, it's too far west for the 2nd Ward.  I'm not sure.
Story_ID: 643336
Speaker 1: What year did you leave--
Speaker 2: Robert Taylor [Robert Taylor Homes, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: December '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: And from there you went to--
Speaker 2: It's called, then it was called United Charities of Chicago [Metropolitan Family Services, Chicago, Illinois].  It was the oldest family service agenc- the oldest and second largest family service agency in the country.  A family, there's a consortium of family service agencies.  They're private, not, they're private and not-for-profit organizations.  They provide direct social service and in our case at United Charities, it provided direct social service and legal aid bureau and it was the first agency in the nation to start a geriatric service so it was called senior, a service for the aged.  So they had the three basic services.  The largest one was in New York [New York] and we were the second largest.
Speaker 1: And what was your job there?
Speaker 2: When I started I did, I was an intake social worker so I did intake application and brief treatment which meant, you know, people come in for various family issues and if they were minor or small and they just needed some short term, what we call then short term shoring up, I would do some brief treatment, six, eight weeks, otherwise I did extensive intake application for, and prepared cases for acceptance for, or accepted them, for caseworkers who would take on ongoing roles.  I actually was one of four employees in the agency who worked on the professional side of the agency without a master's degree.
Speaker 1: Did you see any of your Robert Taylor clients then?
Speaker 2: Did I see any of them?
Speaker 1: Yeah, did they come through there?
Speaker 2: Not initially.  It was geared much more toward middle class, middle class, higher level functioning, if I use that term professionally, and then I'm talking, not socially, clients who had the wherewithal to get to that kind of a private service.  Eventually, however, we had a very, very solid African American manager of our office which was at 61st [Street] and University [Avenue], called Woodlawn District Office and, Midway District Office [sic. Midway Center and Service for the Aged South], but it was in Woodlawn [Chicago, Illinois], and she made, she made that change.  She began to make that change to reach out to people and we shifted our clientele a lot, and we, actually we didn't shift our clientele, we increased our clientele.  We broadened the reach and the scope of the work.
Story_ID: 643337
Speaker 1: Now you say, initially you were a intake worker?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now what was your next position there?
Speaker 2: I was, the agency had always existed.  It was a private agency and extremely well funded and had, it always existed with private bequests and large donations from very wealthy families.  United Charities [United Charities of Chicago; Metropolitan Family Services, Chicago, Illinois] was the non-secular social service agency in the city.  You know, there were all kind of, there was Lutheran Family Services [Lutheran Child and Family Services of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois] and Jewish Family Services [Jewish Child and Family Services, Chicago, Illinois] and Catholic family services, Catholic Charities [Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Chicago], but United Charities was non-secular.  So it, and it was actually the most established and the oldest.  It was started back in 1870, 1871, I think, with the Chicago fire.  It was the agency the city designated to do all of the social work after the Chicago fire.  So they started in '74 [1974], '75 [1975], I think that's when I left and went, and started, they got a lot of competition because, of course, what was happening was other, because the Civil Rights Movement, and because of the pressure on foundations and private donors to create other kinds of services for poor black people and not so much Hispanic then but mainly poor black people and broaden the social service outreach, they began to see a decline in their donations.  So they started a development office and the head of the agency [John D. Purdy] came and asked me, he said, "You know, you'd be a really good development officer because you've worked in the field, you understand direct service and we need someone.  We have professional--a couple of professional development officers, one or two," they said, "but we need someone who can talk to our donors about delivery of service," and they asked me about it and I gave it some thought and decided I was, it was time for me to get out of direct service and I was okay getting out of direct service.  So I went to our downtown office and left the district office at Midway [Midway Center and Service for the Aged South, Chicago, Illinois] and went downtown and did that.  So I got into development fundraising that way.
Speaker 1: Now was the United Way [Community Fund of Chicago; United Way of Metropolitan Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] active during that--
Speaker 2: It was United Way, it was the largest recipient of United Way funds.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Actually, United Charities started the United Way but it was not a United Way.  It was not the United Way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: United Way is just a fundraising.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, no, it was, it--we provided services.  We operated Legal Aid Bureau [Chicago, Illinois].  You've heard of Legal Aid Bureau (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, used to work for them.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So we operated Legal Aid Bu- Legal Aid Bureau was un- under United Charities.
Story_ID: 643338
Speaker 1: Now when you went to the development office, did you have any concerns about the people you were going to be going to to ask for money?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure, how would, what kinds of concerns (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean, this was your first time doing this type of work.  Did you have a really good grasp of just exactly what they were asking you to do in terms of, you know, soliciting donat- donations and stuff?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, I did.  They were very clear about it and I was pretty clear about it by the time I started.  Did I know what I was doing?  Not really.  I went to a couple of seminars.  There was one that was given, really excellent one that was given at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], and I had, and the gentleman who asked me was not a professional development officer either.  We hired the one major development consultant in the, who was in the city then, his name was Charles Feldstein and Charlie had, was one of the first development consultants in the country who had a big agency [Charles R. Feldstein and Company, Inc., Chicago, Illinois].  He did development consulting for colleges and universities and large agencies like United Charities [United Charities of Chicago; Metropolitan Family Services, Chicago, Illinois] but the man who worked for United Charities, John Purdy [John D. Purdy], wasn't a professional development officer either.  He had a good feel for it.  He was personally very wealthy and had tons of friends who were.  He had stopped working at age fifty and decided that he was going to devote his life to doing good.  So he spent ten years with, oh, my goodness, it begins with a C [Community Renewal Society, Chicago, Illinois], I'll think of it in a minute, ten years with another agency and at the end of ten years, and he worked there for a dollar a year or something, at the end of those ten years, he left and decided he wanted to come to United Charities and he began to build a development department, very differently from the way many development departments were built but it was extremely successful.
Speaker 1: How was it different?
Speaker 2: He didn't go out and hire professional development people, he hired people that he, he had a vision for how he wanted to see money raised for this agency and he went out and tapped three of us to come in and help him do that.
Speaker 1: So he kind of felt the people who were on the ground could best tell the story?
Speaker 2: That was why he tapped me.
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Then he did it, got a grants writer who used to be an editor but all of us had a commitment to that agency and to the kind of work that agency did and to the people it served.  So he made sure that your heart was in the right place and that your value system was in the right place and you were doing it for the right reasons before he brought you into this and as a, and that was unique 'cause most agencies were beginning to go out and find professional development officers.  There weren't a lot of them out there but we became professional development officers and then United Charities had such good success and, you know, we could, he could afford to do that too because it could coast on its, almost hundred year old reputation.
Story_ID: 643339
Speaker 1: Who were some of the people that you were assigned to go to?
Speaker 2: One of the big things I did, well, you know, it depends on when we're talking about in my twenty year career, career there.
Speaker 1: When you first started.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went--let's see.  I was there as a social worker from sixty--beginning, early '69 [1969], January '69 [1969] and I think I went downtown.  I'm going to say '75 [1975], I'm not sure, to development.  So those first couple of years I was doing grant writing and I was coming to board meetings, getting to know some of the board members.  It was a very powerful board.  You know, the, back then, it was the chairman of Arthur Andersen [Arthur Andersen LLP], the chairman of the First National Bank [First National Bank of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], these were the names of the corp- major corporations in the city then.  And, so those were the people that I worked with and they would go out and ask for the money and I would go with them and then eventually I started something called the Friends of United Charities [ph.] so I just started in six suburbs with ground work getting people to support the agency [United Charities of Chicago; Metropolitan Family Services, Chicago, Illinois] that way.  Then I did, I started work, I developed a women's board and it's, various ways, but I worked, you know, by the way, you should know Charlie Feldstein [Charles Feldstein] was still the development consultant so he didn't work for the agency but we maintained him and kept him on retainer as a consultant.  So he was always helping to guide this process too, with John Purdy [John D. Purdy].  And it was Charlie who came to me and said, "I, they're going to kill me at this agency but I have a job offer for you" so (laughter), and that's how I left.
Story_ID: 643340
Speaker 1: Where did you go from there?
Speaker 2: To the City of Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was at United Charities [United Charities of Chicago; Metropolitan Family Services, Chicago, Illinois] until '88 [1988].  So from January '69 [1969] to, I think it was June of, May, June of '88 [1988], I was there just about twenty--a couple of months shy of, a few months shy of twe- twenty years.
Speaker 1: Were you always in development?
Speaker 2: No I was, started off as an intake social worker.
Speaker 1: No, I mean, once you started going to--
Speaker 2: Once there, I stayed there, I did.  I never moved again.  I never went back into direct service and then became a development consultant on a pro bono basis while I was still working for the agency.  I didn't get paid for it.  I worked with the United Way [United Way of Metropolitan Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] to provide volunteer development direction for small not-for-profit organizations.  In addition to giving money, the United Way offers professional services, board development, fundraising, all of that, so I volunteered a lot and helped establish some fundraising, consultant seminars and conferences for them and then I'd go out and help small agencies with that.
Speaker 1: So you were raising money, also teaching other people how to raise (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) People how to raise money, exactly.
Story_ID: 643341
Speaker 1: And you left there, in what year?
Speaker 2: Oh, let's see.  Charlie [Charles Feldstein] came into my office quietly and said, "Please, don't tell Jerry Erickson [A. Gerald Erickson]," that was the head of the agency at the time, "and John Purdy [John D. Purdy] that I'm going to do this" (coughs). He said, "But Joan Harris [Joan W. Harris]," who was Irving Harris' [Irving B. Harris] wife who was, had just been appointed commissioner of Department of Cultural Affairs [City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs; City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events] and she wanted a direct, she wanted to start a development office at city government which was unheard of.  It took her months to get that position into government but he said, "I told her when she gets the position I have the perfect person."  I looked at him, I said, "What would make you think I would want to do that?"  And he said, "'Cause I know where your volunteer work has been done," and it was true.  I had been doing a lot of volunteer work with [HistoryMaker] Margaret Burroughs at the DuSable Museum [DuSable Museum of African American History, Chicago, Illinois].  Part of my, and it was an outgrowth of social work, part of my belief was that I began to realize that the children I had seen at Robert Taylor [Robert Taylor Homes, Chicago, Illinois], children I had seen in Woodlawn [Chicago, Illinois] at United Charities [United Charities of Chicago; Metropolitan Family Services] and just through other contacts, we had nowhere to see ourselves reflected on the walls of museums and major institutions and iconic places and I thought that was sad that if kids would--could go to the Art Institute [Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] all the time, they could on really rare occasions see a black face, but one of the reasons I thought Margaret had done such a good job in starting up DuSable Museum was that children could just flock there and see their culture and themselves and their images reflected and, of themselves, reflected on the walls of institutions and quite, frankly, it, an eight year old doesn't really know the difference between the sophistication of an Art Institute and the DuSable Museum, I mean, you can take them to the DuSable Museum and if it's, works for them.  So that was where I was doing a lot of volunteer work for that reason and Charlie knew that.  So his comment was, "I know of your interest in culture and I think you need to try and look at this."  So I met with Joan and a couple of months later went to work, or maybe three months later, went to work for her and she did get through a development office position and within a year or a year and a half, or less, I, she pr- she promoted me to first deputy commissioner.
Speaker 1: Who was the mayor at that time?
Speaker 2: When I first started looking at the position, Harold Washington was the mayor.  And then, by the time, and it took a long time for her, I shouldn't say three months, it must have taken several months for her to get that through the budget process, by the time I took the job, and it was approved, I guess the position was approved in the fall but they wouldn't let her fill it, and then he died, and then there was a change, so it was Gene Sawyer [HistoryMaker Eugene Sawyer] to answer your question, but there were a number of things that happened in that process.  So Gene Sawyer was there and then after that it was Rich Daley [Richard M. Daley].
Story_ID: 643342
Speaker 1: Do you know why there was resistance to what she was trying to do in the--
Speaker 2: Because it was new in city government (laughter).  They had never heard of--at that time, I think city government, the phrase, public private partnership, was just new to everybody who worked there, everybody in the budget office, people who, "What does that mean?  What are you talking about?"  The idea of going out and raising private funds that were not tax based and using them for, in city, in government, which is of course a tax supported institution, was unheard of and she said, "Arts and culture are different.  People are not going to, nobody wants their taxes to go to arts and culture so if we're going to have to, if we're going to build an arts and culture program in the city and strengthen those organizations and institutions that exist, we're going to have to go outside for money."  And, so she managed to convince, at that time, the budget office [City of Chicago Office of Budget and Management], but Harold Washington was in favor of it but then he died in November so--
Speaker 1: Were there any other major cities that had something similar to this?
Speaker 2: I think, I think New York [New York] may have but on a much smaller scale, or did it.  It may have, New York may have.
Speaker 1: Okay, though Chicago [Illinois] was kind of at the forefront of this type of thing (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, very much at the store--forefront, um-hm, and it stayed at the forefront for everything else after that, for arts and culture, 'cause then after, let's see in October of '89 [1989], I only worked with Joan [Joan W. Harris] I'd say, maybe, I went there [City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs; City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events] in spring of '88 [1988].  The whole process by the way started in '87 [1987].  Harold died in--Washington died in November '87 [1987] and the process started maybe August.  So it took from then until I went there in the first of April of '88 [1988] and then she was, she left in October of '88 [1988], '89 [1989], I can't remember, one of the two and Lois Weisberg came.
Story_ID: 643343
Speaker 1: Tell us about Lois Weisberg.
Speaker 2: What do you want to know?  She's brilliant.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's what we hear.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We were very, very close, um-hm.  Before I retired, we were really close.
Speaker 1: What was her kind of vision for the office?
Speaker 2: I don't know that Lois had a vision for the office at all.  She didn't care about the off- I mean, I don't mean she didn't care about the office but Lois was an administrative person.  Lois had a vision for the arts in the city and she had a history for that.  She had, she had started the Shakespeare festival.  She had started, who's the author?  My brain's flat lined now.  She started Friends of the Parks [Chicago, Illinois].  She started, oh, the playwright, Irish playwright, what's his name?  Yeah, you do, everybody knows him.  Anyway, Shaw [George Bernard Shaw] (laughter), she started the Shaw Festival.  She would do standup part, have standup works of Shaw presented at small theaters.  She had done tons of work as a volunteer in arts and culture and she really wanted that job.  So she really went after it in all kinds of ways and the mayor appointed her to it and people didn't understand it because, of course, because Lois, it was very different from the job she had held under Harold Washington.  Lois had been head of the off- Mayor's Office of Special Events under Harold Washington for years.  She started the festivals.  She started the jazz [Chicago Jazz Festival], blues [Chicago Blues Festival], gospel festival [Chicago Gospel Music Festival].  She inherited Taste of Chicago but she turned it into a festival rather than just a taste, a tasting of foods, of food and restaurants and, so she added all the extra components to it.  So when she got appointed to this, people, it was very different.  People were not ex- they thought, oh, she's going to turn arts and culture into a party and they didn't know her background in serious arts and culture, as people called it, but what she believed in strongly was the people of the City of Chicago [Illinois] at all levels and, so how do you diversify the arts and culture, and she went about doing that.  She had a real commitment to that and she did do it, and it was just, actually as I said to my husband [Lynn Small], sixteen of the best years of my, sixteen of the best years of my life.
Speaker 1: What was the initial reaction of the arts community to--
Speaker 2: To Lois?
Speaker 1: No, to this department [City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs; City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events]?  I mean, did they include (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, the department existed before she got there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I mean, Joan--
Speaker 2: Joan Harris [Joan W. Harris] was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear).
Speaker 2: --Harris was there and before Joan, Fred Fine was there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Fred Fine was a professor from, he's kind of an old Harold Washington supporter, liberal, and he really was very big in the arts and was involved with Columbia College [Columbia College Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  So he had been the commissioner but it was kind of a fractured department.  It was, when it, everybody went in their own different ways, separate ways.  So the department was, by the time Lois got there, it was established because Joan had start- started establishing it.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And it had existed in the, in another name and another form and a smaller form since Mike Bilandic's wife, Heather Bilandic [Heather Morgan Bilandic] had started something called the Commission of Fine--on Fine Arts, I think, or Council on Fine Arts [Chicago Council on Fine Arts], Commission on Fine Arts [sic.].  Back in the '70s [1970s] there was a movement throughout the United States to start what was called local arts agencies, they were councils or commissions, many of them were private, some of them were connected to government, hers was a quasi-governmental agency.  It got a lot of support.  This is, but Heather Bilandic started that.  So it had been around, in the cultural center, in a very small form for years and then Fred Fine took it to the next step.  Joan took it to even the next step and Lois sort of blew it out of the water.
Speaker 1: But she did the cows, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, she did the cows.  She did the furniture.  She did, she's the one who brought summer dance to Grant Park [Chicago, Illinois].  She did all the outdoor sculpture of all kinds.  She did the Botero exhibit ['Botero in Chicago'] which was in Grant Park.  Yeah, she, if you brought Lois an idea and the cows came from another city, the mayor [Richard M. Daley] sent her, it actually came from him, nobody (laughter), he's amazing.  He read everything so he would, she and I would walk into the office with little, with little copies of newspaper clippings with his hand- big scrawling handwriting, "Check this out for me."  He would read, and he read about the cows in Switzerland and he said, "Lois, check this out," and she did and she turned it into what it is and turned it into a national, you know, it became national?  So, yeah, she, but her vision was just extraordinary.  I mean, it was, and it was her vision for the city that she had and the people of the city and she really strongly believed in that.
Story_ID: 643344
Speaker 1: So what were your kind of duties and responsibilities as first deputy [for the City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs; City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events]?
Speaker 2: Everything.  I worked hand in--side by side with her on many, many, many of the arts issues and many arts projects and if she'd have somebody in her office, I, "Joan [HistoryMaker Joan Small], come over and let's talk.  You've got to meet this person, they've got the best idea," and then we'd get staff to implement it if she liked it or if we thought it would work.  I also oversaw all the administrative parts of the, of the, of the office.  Lois [Lois Weisberg] didn't like to deal with budget.  She didn't like to deal with hiring and firing, she did if it got complicated and I said, "You know, no, you need do this yourself."  She did, but she didn't like it.  She really loved the creative end of that job and really spent much of her time on the creative end but it was, it was terrific, it was really special.  She also brought Sister Cities into the City of Chicago [Illinois] and we didn't even have a sister, well, we had a non-existent Sister Cities program but she expanded it the way it was and I had full responsibility for that which was terrific.
Story_ID: 643345
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We were talking about the, your position as deputy commissioner of the, and can you tell us a little bit more about, what other things the agen- the department did in terms of working with various organizations and who were your focus?  What kind of organizations were your focus?
Speaker 2: The citizens, the people of Chicago [Illinois], citizens of Chicago were our focus.  Secondarily, our focus was other not-for-profit, were not-for-profit private arts agencies and organizations.  We would fund them through a program called CityArts and that CityArts program funded four levels of organizations and we did four different, four levels of funding to four different sizes, size, groups of agencies, by, organized by size, CityArts I, II, III and IV, and I think CityArts I was organizations somewhere around a hundred, hundred fifty thousand dollars annual budget.  CityArts II was anywhere, I would think from, this is just a guess at this point, back then it may have been 150 to five or two hundred to five hundred thousand [dollars].  CityArts III was larger, anywhere from five hundred thousand to 1 or 2, 1 million and CityArts IV was a million dollar organization and, or larger, and that pretty much was what people refer to in the field as the majors, that's the Art Institute [Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], all the museums in the park, including DuSable [DuSable Museum of African American History, Chicago, Illinois] and Mexican Fine Arts Center and Museum [National Museum of Mexican Art, Chicago, Illinois], which has changed its name now and Field Museum [Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, Illinois] and then the symphony [Chicago Symphony Orchestra] and the Lyric [Lyric Opera of Chicago] and so forth.  And we were probably much more, and Lois [Lois Weisberg] and I both recognized that she would, really was a firm believer in this, that the smaller arts agencies could benefit much more from our help.  They, we were much more important to them.  If you're giving a small amount of money and our grants program, by the way, was only funded at its highest point during my tenure of sixteen years.  Its highest point, it was funded just under $2 million.  So if you have to divide that up among a few hundred agencies and you're only giving five, ten at the most at one time, I think we were giving twenty thousand to what we called the majors.  You know, twenty thousand dollars to the Art Institute, the Lyric and the symphony is not much of a percent, a large percentage of their budget compared to five thousand dollars of an agency whose budget is anywhere from seventy-five to a hundred thousand, you really have a much bigger impact.  The main thing that CityArts and the city, the Department of Cultural Affairs [City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs; City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events] through its CityArts grants program did was to help smaller agencies establish themselves and then they could use that as recognition that they existed and that they were worthwhile and they could leverage those dollars into, with other foundations, 'cause they got a nod.  They got a nod from an established existing organization or city government and, so they could apply to other foundations, they could go to private donors, they could go to the State of Illinois for the Illinois Arts, Ill- Illinois Arts Council grants or Illinois Humanities Council grants, either one.  So it helped them leverage, more importantly, helped them leverage other dollars.  The other thing we did through our CityArts program was to provide services.  Earlier on I told you I had done some consulting through the United Way to help organizations gain, raise money to teach them how to raise money.  We had a similar program with our, at the Department of Cultural Affairs.  We let, helped them, small arts organizations do board development, help them get in touch with agents, with potential board members, how to treat board members, how to raise money, just all of the various services that not-for-profit organizations need and many of them couldn't afford to go to the National Society of Fundraising Executives [sic. National Society for Fund Raising Executives; Association of Fundraising Professionals].  You know, they, those kinds of organizations exist but they charge a fee for those kinds of seminars and we provided this fee, free for them.

Speaker 1: And when you first started, what was the budget and how big was your staff?
Speaker 2: Oh, our staff was probably in the sixties, some sixty, seventy people.  Budget was under three, four million [dollars], somewhere around there.  By the time I left, at one, by the time I left it dropped a little bit.  At its highest point, it was just over twenty million and I think our staff had gotten up to, if you counted all the staff, not just city government staff, 'cause we had some people on private, on different payrolls.  We had the, office of tourism had, was part of our department [City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs; City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events] so they were paid through tourism funds and so forth but if you combined all the staff, I think we could get up to about 280, 285, 290, and then it began to whittle down.
Speaker 1: Was this for budget reasons?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, always for budget reasons.  We couldn't have had stronger support from the mayor [Richard M. Daley] and, of course, Mrs. Daley's [Maggie Daley] office was right next to mine.  She had an office in the cultural center [Chicago Cultural Center, Chicago, Illinois] and she ran something called the cultural center foundation [Chicago Cultural Center Foundation, Chicago, Illinois] which was an entity established solely to raise money for programs at the cultural center, which was really quite remarkable.  I was president of a national local arts agency organization, it was the arts, the organization that the directors and heads of the fifty large, the agencies of the fifty largest cities were part of this organization, it was called Urban Arts Federation, U.S. Urban Arts Federation [United States Urban Arts Federation], and we were the envy of everybody because we had that kind of direct access and Lois [Lois Weisberg] would go, would sometimes go to meetings.  She hated going to meetings, that's why I represented her on all those things but everyone wanted to know and they'd come to Chicago [Illinois], "How did you get this kind of inside track," and I said, "We got it but we mainly got it because we have a first lady who really is devoted to the arts and wants to bring the arts to every level of Chicago."  So that's how she started Arts Matter [Arts Matter Foundation, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 1: Now was (clears throat)--
Speaker 2: --and Gallery 37, um-hm.
Story_ID: 643347
Speaker 1: Was there much resistance in the city council [Chicago City Council]?  I assume that because Daley [Richard M. Daley] was in support of this at, you know, city council was never a problem or was it?
Speaker 2: For our department [City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs; City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events] you mean?
Speaker 1: For funding, yeah.
Speaker 2: Mixed answer.  Early on, when he appointed Lois [Lois Weisberg] to her position, we weren't in the cultural center [Chicago Cultural Center, Chicago, Illinois], we were at 179 West Randolph [Street], somewhere around there, 178 West Randolph it was.  So we were between Randolph and Wells Street in a building that was not as wide as this room and we were going to stay there but then the library, the new library [Harold Washington Library Center, Chicago, Illinois] was being built so it was just a ton of hoopla about what's going to happen to the old cultural center and he couldn't, in good conscience, get rid of it 'cause his mother [Eleanor "Sis" Daley] had saved it back in the '70s [1970s] and turned it into a cultural center with some help but he was going to do all, there were all kinds of rumors about what he was going to do with it.  So Lois quietly went over and said, "Give it to me and I'll turn it into a cultural center for all the people of the City of Chicago [Illinois]," and he kept saying, "We can't afford this, we can't afford this, the city's in trouble, we can't afford this," I mean it was his mantra, we can't afford it.  Don't ask me for any money.  So she finally went in and said to him, "Give it to me and I won't ask you for a dime.  I'll find the money someplace else" (laughter).
Speaker 1: That was a pretty bold statement.
Speaker 2: It was a bold statement, it was too bold, but he said, looked at her, he said, "Not that I truly believe you but you need to try and do this and it makes sense for the people in the City of Chicago."  So she did and from there you know the rest of it.  It was dramatically successful.  (Laughter) She did ask for more money and many times she got it.  City council didn't object too much, not, any aldermen, there wasn't one alderman of all fifty who would really come down on what we were doing because all of their constituents benefitted.  That's the thing that they liked and their constituents liked it.  It wasn't elite.  It wasn't restricted.  It was open.  One of the things that Lois did that all of their, the organizations and their wards loved was, we had a policy that any not-for-profit arts organization could use the cultural center for free for a benefit, to raise money for their programs and their mission, the only requirement was that they had to pay the ci- pay for all the money that would come out of our budget for set up, cleaning, whatever the overhead costs for producing an event would be.  We, what we did was waive the vary expensal rental fee, expensive rental fee and when you could have a benefit and not have to pay the cost, except paying for set up and your own equipment, at the cultural center, you really did tend to raise money 'cause people wanted to pay to come to that event, that venue.  And, so that was a real gift to many arts organizations.  Sometimes our staff who ran that part of the department would say, "Stop giving them away, please, 'cause we have to rent this," 'cause we supplemented our own budget with renting the cultural center.
Story_ID: 643348
Speaker 1: In terms of your staff, were there people who were like specialists in certain areas?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Who were some of those type of, types of positions?
Speaker 2: Well, back then, we didn't have the office of special events.  Now, it's currently under Michelle Boone, the current mayor [Rahm Emmanuel] has put the office of special events [Mayor's Office of Special Events] into that department [City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs; City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events] but we had the grants program, and they were all specialists in grants and in providing services to small not-for-profit or even midsize not-for-profit arts organizations.  We had four curators.  We had a, we had the public art department so that was a specialized department and actually we have one of the best public art departments in the City of Chicago [Illinois] throughout the nation, one of the best in the nation here in this city.  We had four terrific curators.  A friend used to say to me all the time, "You know, you're lucky that he doesn't, hasn't left you to go to a private agency 'cause they're always after him," the head of curatorial staff.  We had, let me think what else.  We had (laughter), we had some of the grants people I've talked about, we had sister cities and the sister cities staff was about twenty and our twenty would, in order to be a member of that staff, you had to speak, be fluent in a second language.  Most of them had master's degrees in some other culture and language in international studies, so that was specialized.  We had people who set, who did the sales for the department, I mean, for the venue for the cultural center [Chicago Cultural Center, Chicago, Illinois], and they came out of the sales and special events or, yeah, special events background.  We had finance people who were just strictly accountants.  So we had administrative specialists and art specialists.
Story_ID: 643349
Speaker 1: I think you said before the break that the sister cities program was something that you were heavily involved in.  How did that come about then?
Speaker 2: I oversaw it for years, um-hm.  How did sister cities come about?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Sister cities, the Chicago [Illinois] sister cities program is part of a national organization called the international association of sister cities [Sister Cities International], it's out of Washington, D.C. Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower] started the sister cities program back in the '50s [1950s] after he left, after he became president and after the war [World War II, WWII] because he felt that people to people, person to person, face to face contact would help remove some of the ugliness, some, among, that exists among people and he established the national organization which has the misnomer of being called the international sister cities program but it's the national office in D.C. and various large cities established local chapters.  Chicago had one that hardly existed during the Harold Washington administration, it began to pick up a little bit of steam and we, I think under Jane Byrne it also picked up a little steam.  She began to, those, those two mayors began to recognize the importance of international presence and international economic development and what that could do for your city in terms of tourism and economic development and what it could do for your own business, is it could go overseas.  When Lois [Lois Weisberg] took office, I mean, took office as a commissioner, I think we had twelve maybe, ten, twelve sister cities.  By the time I left in 2004, we were up to twenty-six.
Story_ID: 643350
Speaker 1: How did you decide which cities (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) City was next?
Speaker 1: --became sister cities?
Speaker 2: It's a complicated process.  There had to be a constituency that would support it here in the City of Chicago [Illinois].  Those that we inherited, those twelve were fairly obvious.  We had Warsaw [Poland] 'cause you got the largest Polish population.  Vilnius [Lithuania] 'cause you've got, no not, Vilnius I think we signed later.  Which one in Ireland?  There's one in Ireland that'll come to me in a second.  That one because you've got such a large Irish population and, so that's one of the reasons.  That was the first twelve.  The next group we began to look at business potential, cultural exchanges, what kinds of business exchanges would benefit our businessmen that they could take things to those sister cities and, as I said, whether or not there was a constituent base in Chicago that could support it.  Every sister city had a mini board, M-I-N-I, mini board.  You had a chair of the sister city committee and that person sat on a larger board which was called the Chicago Sister Cities International Program board of directors and they ran it and by the way, it was a not-for-profit.  We had seven not-for-profits in our department [City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs; City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events] but it was in partnership with the City of Chicago 'cause you couldn't, it couldn't exist as just a not-for-profit.  And each committee, each, I'm sorry, each sister city had a series of committees and there were activities.  There was culture, cultural exchanges, business exchanges, sports exchanges, educational exchanges, there were three or four more but you get the idea.  They, and each of those exchanges had a committee to work on that.  So you had to have enough people who were interested in Milan [Italy] to be able to sustain all those activities.  It's a huge undertaking, quite honestly.  We did in 1996, I believe, no, 1994, we did host the Chicago, the international sister cities convention here and it was really quite wonderful, only, only rivaled by the millennium party that we had.
Speaker 1: Now you said somebody from the staff had to be able to speak the language of the sister city?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, we had, we had five staff, five staff members and a director and each five staff members had, and we were depending on where we were in history, either two or three sister cities that they staffed and they had to be fluent in at least two of those languages.  So it, but it wasn't as hard.  If you were, if you spoke Italian, chances are, you know, Paris [France] is a sister city, chances are you know enough of the Romance languages to get by in French and as well as Italian and if you spoke, we had three African sister cities and if you spoke Spanish you could do, you know, a couple, you could do the one in South America, you could do Mexico City [Mexico], so it just, it kind of fell together.
Speaker 1: What were the African sister cities?
Speaker 2: We had, one in North Africa and that's going to come to me in a minute. We had Accra in Ghana (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Ghana.
Speaker 2: --and Durban in South Africa and let me just think about the one in North Africa, it'll come, I'll get it.
Speaker 1: And these probably came up during your tenure there.  I mean--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: All three of them, um-hm.  No, I'm sorry, Ghana existed beforehand.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It just wasn't active.  None of them were active when Lois [Lois Weisberg] arrived.  I mean they really, and they began to take up like 60 percent of my time at some point.
Story_ID: 643351
Speaker 1: How many of the cities did you actually get to go to?
Speaker 2: You know, she had a very, very hard fast rule and so did the mayor [Richard M. Daley] and so did I that we, the easiest thing to come, for sister cities' downfall is to, that it begins to look like a boondoggle.  So we didn't go to that many cities.  It was only after, maybe six, seven years that, oh, I know the North African city was Morocco, just (laughter), in Casablanca, I mean, Casablanca in Morocco.  He would not go until five or six years, he would say, "Nope, nope" because taxpayers start talking about it as a boondoggle, the press picks it up and, you know, they're quick to jump on anything and should.  I'm not saying they shouldn't, but they should.  So we finally convinced him, one of the rules of the sis- International Sister Cities program is that you have to have a signing, a formal signing of the mayor, with the mayor of each city in each city.  So when he signed the one for Lucerne [Switzerland], he had to, you know, the mayor of Lucerne, for example, would come to Chicago [Illinois] and he signed an agreement here.  It isn't fully established until Chicago's mayor goes to Lucerne.  So whenever he would find himself for some other reason in another part of the world, he would, we managed to convince him to go by and formalize this agreement.  Eventually he began, as the business contacts for Chicagoans began to increase, he began to say, "Okay, I can justify this."  It isn't that he didn't see the value in it, he had to justify the value because, and you never could justify the value of Lois [Lois Weisberg] and I traveling that much, so she never went.  I think she may have gone on one sister cities trip.  I went with Mrs. Daley [Maggie Daley] to Prague [Czech Republic].  I went to, where else did I go?  I went to Durban [South Africa] but that was not because of, I mean it was because of sister cities but it wasn't on a sister cities trip, it was because they wanted me to come and give a paper in Johannesburg [South Africa], Durban and Cape Town [South Africa] on cultural tourism at their request right after Mandela's [Nelson Mandela] administration took hold.  I had to go over an expert, as an expert and do that which was wonderful.  I went to, where else did I go?  I went to, didn't go to Asia.  I can't remember, maybe three, four, oh, Milan [Italy].  I went to Milan.
Speaker 1: How did you track the business flow in terms of what benefits Chicago or the sister city got out of the relationship?
Speaker 2: Import, export through the staff.  Our sister cities staff did it and the committees and the volunteers.  If you're a businessman who wants to do business in, and our two Chinese sister cities were Shanghai [China] and Shenyang [China], and let's say you had something you wanted to do import, ex- import or export to or from Shanghai then you got involved on that committee and we knew that.  I mean, it wasn't a negative, it was, you had to have access and you monitored it.  You made sure it wasn't abused but you, we could, we could track it because we knew who was involved and then we could track how many exports were done.  We could track how many new businesses were set up.  We could track how many new businesses would fail.
Story_ID: 643352
Speaker 1: Getting back to some of the organizations.  The, you called it level one or--
Speaker 2: CityArts I, II, III and IV (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  CityArts I, how did those organizations get to you or know about--
Speaker 2: It came.  Everybody in the arts knew about CityArts.  If there's money to be found, organizations find you.  We advertised.  We had various seminars.  We'd send out publication--flyers.  Most of those organizations belong--or the people in those organizations belonged to something else.  They might have belonged to the state, may have been getting money from the state or they may have worked with the park district or, so they, just, not just word of mouth but through professional circles.
Speaker 1: Was there, what was the level of participation, black organizations?  Were a lot of those at level I because they might have been smaller?
Speaker 2: I don't think we, they might have been smaller.
Speaker 1: They might have been smaller?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.  I think they're, they probably were levels II and III.  I'm not sure if we, did we have, yeah, I guess the DuSable Museum [DuSable Museum of African American History, Chicago, Illinois] might have been a level IV.  Mexican Fine Arts Center and Museum [National Museum of Mexican Art, Chicago, Illinois] might have been a level IV but there aren't, most of them were levels II and III.  eta [eta Creative Arts Foundation, Chicago, Illinois], let me think what else.  [HistoryMaker] Jackie Taylor's BET [Black Ensemble Theater, Chicago, Illinois], you know, a lot of those were IIs and IIIs.  Most of the, and I couldn't even tell you the race of most of the CityArts I because they were small organizations, mainly neighborhood community based organizations but they served a purpose for that small area and the director of the CityArts program was black so she made sure that, and everybody knew her, everybody knew Mary [ph.] so--
Speaker 1: What were the qualifications for the program?  I mean, did you have to, did people have to put in an application and review--
Speaker 2: Oh, definitely.  They had to, you mean to apply for a grant?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: There were no qualifications for the services we provided.  If you were trying to start an organization and you wanted to learn how to found a, start a board and how to service that board, anybody could come to those.  We'd hold those--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at the cultural, those kinds of things at the cultural center [Chicago Cultural Center, Chicago, Illinois] on an, maybe once every two months or so the staff would run those but for the grants, you just made an application like you do for any other government grant or a private grant.
Speaker 1: And did you have like a committee that reviewed those?
Speaker 2: We had a, we had exactly that.  We had a non-government volunteer committee of artists and arts administrators and arts leaders from around the country.  That's also the way we judged which exhibitions that was started early on and that was one of the big things that our department [City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs; City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events] was known for nationally.  A, there were two things.  The success of the CityArts program and it was an exemplary grants program for every major city in the United States.  I mean, they would just come and visit or we would go out and tell them or we'd send them materials.  It really, most of the city, of the, most of the major cities around the United States are patterned, grants programs are patterned after CityArts.  The other was the juried, the juried process we used for exhibitions.  The exhibitions, you know, it's tricky because you can get someone's cousin or mother-in-law or father-in-law who's related to an alderman's secretary who wants, has the best art work in the world and how do you get it into the cultural center and how do I get an exhibition somewhere and they've got to, and then you get the pressure to do that exhibition and we could always step back and say, "Sorry, we don't make these decisions, they're done by a juried art committee."
Story_ID: 643353
Speaker 1: Did you do Black Creativity?
Speaker 2: No, Black Creativity's done by the--
Speaker 1: Okay.  They did it all themselves.
Speaker 2: They did it all.  I personally was on that board for, that committee for many years but, no, had nothing to do with the city, city government.  I was on there before I went to work for the Department of Cultural Affairs [City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs; City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events].  I was on the benefit committee but, we did one little piece of it.  People talk about Black Creativity, most times they're talking about the benefit that was also the exhibition that you're probably aware of.  We would give, initially we gave a small grant to the exhibition but then the museum decided, and I don't know if rightly or wrongly, they decided that they thought that the benefit should fully fund the exhibition.  I professionally, personally don't agree with that but--
Speaker 1: Yeah, and just to clarify that, the Black Creativity was at the Museum of Science and Industry [Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --every year.
Speaker 2: Correct (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 643354
Speaker 1: As you look back upon your--how many years at the, as deputy commissioner?
Speaker 2: Sixteen.
Speaker 1: Sixteen.  What things would you say were the things that you were most proud of?
Speaker 2: Sister cities, it grew and was very effective.  The staff, I enjoyed the staff and I think the training and supervision that they received from me, they must, because they're still in touch with me.  I was very proud of that.  We had a really terrific development program eventually and I started the development program back in '88 [1988], '89 [1989], '89 [1989] I guess it was.  Let me just think.  The fact that our department [City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs; City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events] kept its value system up.  You know, I remember when I first went to work for city government and I had all these, sometimes illusions, sometimes real fears, about how you balance your integrity in government because of all the things we, you know, having grown up in the city and I remember saying to my husband [Lynn Small] when I left, "If you see my value shifting or my sense of integrity shifting, let me know 'cause I have to leave this job right away," and I actually never, ever felt that and maybe in or two times when it got a little close and I would just say, "I'm not going to do it," and it was made, it wasn't just me, it was really made easier because of Lois [Lois Weisberg].  As close as she was to that mayor [Richard M. Daley], I must say in all of my sixteen years, I may have gotten one phone call to hire someone and that is just unheard of and people don't believe it but it actually is true and she would say that.  She would say, "No, I'm not doing that.  No, we can't do that, that's not what we do in this department," and she'd say it, you know, city, she and I got very adept at how to handle aldermen--city council [Chicago City Council].  "Nope, can't do that."  "No, you really don't want to see that in the paper do you?"  "You don't really want that to come out?"  So maintaining that over sixteen years in that kind of political setting, and we were really, truly an apolitical department, I must say.  So that was one, another thing I was proud of.
Story_ID: 643355
Speaker 1: When did you leave the Department of Cultural Affairs [City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs; City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events]?
Speaker 2: Kicking and screaming?  In 2004 they offered a buyout and I came home and sort of flippantly threw this and said, "Oh, look, Lynn [Lynn Small], they've got a buyout," to my husband, "they've got a, they're offering a buyout," and he said, he said, "Why don't you read it and see what it says?"  I had no intention whatsoever of leaving the world's best job and I was much too young to retire.  Well, much is stretching it.  I was too young to retire, I was way below retirement age.  So I gave it to him and he read it and he said, "We can't afford for you not to take this retirement offer."  I said, "What?"  He said, "They're offering to give you five years," basically bottom line, I was going to come out close to full max retirement with sixteen years and they were offering a buyout with full medical benefits, insurance bene- including prescription and medical, secondary medical benefits and he said, "They will never offer this again."  The city, city government can't afford to continue to offer these kinds of buyouts and he said, "Believe me, they'll never offer it with the medical benefits.  We can't afford for you not to take it."  He said, "I don't care if you go back and ask Lois [Lois Weisberg] or the mayor [Richard M. Daley], 'Let's work someway--place else,' do whatever," he said, "you have to take this job, I mean, this buyout."  So I did, kicking and screaming along with about twenty other people from our department but, yeah, so I would still be there if not.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now it had to be a tremendous loss to the department, for twenty people to leave?
Speaker 2: Oh, I could flatter myself and, yeah, the twenty people, yes, and as someone said, "What's happening," and there were, I think five of us in, I was, of course, Lo- Lois didn't need to, didn't have to retire 'cause she really didn't have, she had not been there that long and she didn't have the same kind of pension plan and program, she had done something else and she'd been in and out of government but five of us, I was the highest level but three people right under me, deputy commissioners, I was the top deputy and there were three people under me left and then a couple of assistants left.  So we lost a, as someone said, "The institutional memory is walking out the door" (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: And it did, but Lois stayed.  She lost a lot of good administrative support but then she left and, so, but, you know, they are, they are fine.  I know the new commissioner [Michelle Boone], she's not new anymore, I know the commissioner.  She worked for us for years, she ran our Gallery 37 program for a long time, so I know her, and she's just wonderful.  So it was, it was a loss but it started, it's really come back and I'm glad to see that the current administration is really supporting it.
Story_ID: 643356
Speaker 1: Now this is kind of a little takeoff on what you were saying about the sister cities program.  As you look back upon your career there, what are the programs, other than the sister cities program, that you were most in love with?
Speaker 2: I loved our exhibition program.  We had a fabulous curatorial staff led by a really terrific curator, so I loved the exhibitions.  The grants program was good and I liked it because it provided service directly to small arts organizations and to people and it could spawn other arts groups.  You know, who didn't love the cows? You know, everybody loved the cows.  I kind of got tired of them after a while 'cause they just took over our lives but I did love the cows.  I thought our summer dance program was a really good social experiment in how to bring all kinds of people together in a public setting and it's still going strong and it's really, really very good.  The department [City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs; City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events] helped to host something called the Dame Myra Hess concerts [Dame Myra Hess Memorial Concerts] which were on WFMT [WFMT Radio, Chicago, Illinois] every Wednesday and that was done in conjunction with an outside organization, it was a partnership, it was a not-for-profit, small not-for-profit and they would hold classical concerts in Preston Bradley Hall every Wednesday that was broad- and they were broadcast over WFMT, live broadcast, and that brought all kinds of people to the cultural center [Chicago Cultural Center, Chicago, Illinois] and to classical music who couldn't afford to go to classical music.  So it was those kinds of things that I really sort of cherished and thought, and was proud, I was proud of those.
Story_ID: 643357
Speaker 1: One thing I didn't, I'm going to go back and ask you about, the corporate sponsors.  Who were some of the most, did you go to the most and who put, supported the organization the most?
Speaker 2: So after a year and a half or so when I was appointed first deputy, I moved away from development into, overall administration.  We still had a development department but also around that time, the Chicago Cultural Center Foundation [Chicago, Illinois] was started and they began to raise well over a million dollars for the department [City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs; City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events].  Some of our good corporate sponsors for some of our major programs, Gallery 37, for example, was, well United Airlines was really one, actually I start--I was the one who brought them in because I, Lynn [Lynn Small] was no long- my husband was no longer at United but he had been in advertising and marketing so I knew the people who were there and I approached them and sister cities was a terrific program for them to sponsor.  They also sponsored a couple of exhibitions, so they were big sponsors.  They also gave the department tickets, as well as finances, to bring artists and artwork in from other parts of the world and other parts of the country.  I'm trying to think of the big sponsor for, oh, Exelon [Exelon Corporation, Chicago, Illinois], was a big sponsor for Gallery 37.  First Chicago [First National Bank of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], Chicago Mercantile Exchange [Chicago, Illinois], and it depended on what branch of the department.  You know, we became pretty big and pretty broad under Lois [Lois Weisberg], you know, we did a lot of things, and I remember some of my old friends in fundraising at other organizations, non- not arts organizations but other not-for-profit organizations, some from social works saying to me at some point during Millennium Park days, "Millennium Park is drying up all the private money in the City of Chicago [Illinois].  No one can raise money," and I looked at this person and I said, "Then tell me how the Art Institute [Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the Lyric Opera [Lyric Opera of Chicago]," there was one other one, "MCA, Museum of Contemporary Art [Chicago, Illinois], are all having new construction, major expansion of their physical plant and facilities. How is it that they are all doing this and before they break ground they're almost fully funded?"  So I don't think that was true but major corporations gave different parts of our department, was easy for people to give to Mrs. Daley's [Maggie Daley] program.  First of all, it was Mrs. Daley, but secondly, and primarily, it was a children's arts program.  It was for after school, taking kids off the street into arts training programs, so that's an easy call, you know.  People would say that she, that she pressured.  She didn't have to pressure anybody.  (Laughter) You know, you'd go to somebody with that one and that's an easy one.  So, and they, that raised a lot of good funding.  I had a lot of good funding, rather.

Speaker 1: Now were there any particular organizations that started out at I and just exploded after that based upon your--
Speaker 2: You mean our CityArts I--
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and became CityArts III?  Oh, I know there were and now you're going to press me to figure one out.  I saw BET grow, Black Ensemble Theater [Chicago, Illinois], Jackie, [HistoryMaker] Jackie Taylor's program, Jackie grew.  Mexican fine arts museum [Mexican Fine Arts Center and Museum; National Museum of Mexican Art, Chicago, Illinois] was one of, started off as a CityArts I, I didn't see it as a CityArts I, I saw it as a II, and it exploded and it is, it is now, and has been for many years, the largest and most successful Mexican art and history museum in the nation.  Some of the music groups did.  What is it, the gay men's chorus, I'm trying to think of the profe- the proper name for it.  Was it the gay men's chorus [Chicago Gay Men's Chorus]?  It may be the name, that may not be the name and I really don't want to have the wrong name, but anyway, they grew into a major organization.  Chicago Children's Choir moved into the cultural center [Chicago Cultural Center, Chicago, Illinois] when they had nowhere else to go and I, they started as a small group long before I got to the department [City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs; City of Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events] but I watched them grow from, not from there but from here.  They grew very well.

Speaker 1: Looking back on your, your entire career, what would you--
Speaker 2: That's depressing (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) It sounds like it was very good.  What would you most like to be remembered for?  What would you like your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: That's a good question, I never thought of it.  I guess I would want to combine, and I hope I did combine, my interest in social service and people and bringing arts and cultural services to people.  I hope that some point they started like this (gesture) and they came back together.  I guess I've always viewed the arts and one of my operating theories in arts and culture was that the arts can bridge the similar- similarities and differences among people and that they can bring people closer together once they recognize and understand and appreciate differences in culture and once that happens, you begin to handle all, begin to look at ways that you can bring different races together, different classes of people and I'm hoping that that, that's what I mean when I say you bridge, that social service has bridged all of this and delivery of service to people, whether it's the arts or social services.
Speaker 1: What is your view of the arts (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Did that make sense by the way?
Speaker 1: Yeah.

Speaker 1: What is your view of the arts community today in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I think it's thriving.  I'm not sure they're getting, that it's thriving as much as it was before but I'm not sure that's not a function of the economy.  When, you know, it's the old, the old theory.  It's the same thing that happened with public schools.  You remove the arts and you remove sports when their budget crunches and, at the times when you should not be removing them but people who are less in the know decide that that's what you do.  So, and it was something that happened recently.  I remember saying to my husband [Lynn Small] just last week, oh, what was it?  I can't remember what it was.  I'll have to check but there was some issue that involved arts and culture and delivery of, delivery of a product.  I can't think of what it was but I remember saying to him, "You know, if you have to give people an exhibition or you give them bread and butter," I, no social worker, I've got to come down on bread and butter but I think that, I do think, to answer your question, I think it's thriving.  I think, I think it has diminished a little bit but that's really because of the economy, and donors are falling off.  You know, it's true with the, when people's portfol- personal portfolios begin to collapse or their endowment, their own endowments for arts organizations begin to fall, then they're on shaky ground.

Speaker 1: Is there anything we've talked about that we didn't cover that you want to include in?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  We talked a lot about family.  We just had a wonderful experience with our extended, with an extended family, my mother's [Ella Peters Flemings] nephew and that was wonderful.  We didn't talk about that but it's with someone that you interviewed just earlier and that was [HistoryMaker] Ann Smith, she was very close to this family.  We had a, my husband [Lynn Small] and I went to a dedication of a major high school in Columbia, Missouri and my first cousin, my mother's nephew, was, and his wife [Muriel Williams Battle] were honored.  It's the largest high school in the State of Missouri and the fifth largest high school in the United States and it was named for his wife.  It started off being named for the two of them but it's very hard to, for some people in Missouri to understand and especially in that part of Missouri that, to understand that you can name a high school of that mag- magnitude after a black woman so, I mean after a black couple, so there was a little, there were a few rumblings and some outspoken groups that said, "You can't name a," by the way, his wife is deceased, he was still alive at the time, this was back in June, that, "you can't name a school after a person who's still alive," and there was just, and it was an effort to try and get the name moved to someone else and he fixed them very quickly by saying, "That's fine, take my name off of it and name it after my wife, she's deceased."  So they did.  We went to the dedication.  It turns out to be a huge, huge, huge, huge, huge honor, sponsored by the University of Missouri [Columbia, Missouri] and it was really magnificent.  So that's what happens when you have a lot of, they moved there to Columbia over, almost sixty years ago and he quietly helped to integrate that town 'cause they moved there to, in segregated circumstances and she became associate superintendent of schools and he became head of the guidance and counseling program and an adjunct prof at Missouri and now they've got this huge $84 million, eighty-five acre facility named after them, which is really quite, quite extraordinary.  So going all the way back to family is what I was doing, sort of circling back to that.
Speaker 1: Give us the name of the high school.
Speaker 2: It's called the Muriel Williams Battle High School [Columbia, Missouri] and I do have a digital picture of it (laughter) 'cause the dedication was just, and his name was Elliot Battle.  The sad part of that story is that we were there on June 2nd for the dedication, we left on June 4th, 3rd was the day we left, after the dedication, and he died suddenly on June 10th.
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: So, but he did get to, they were all, he was senior, he was fine, it was, had a one car accident so we think he had a heart incident and had an accident, but he got to see one of the proudest days of his life as he said on television.  It was all over the news, from St. Louis [Missouri] to Kansas City [Missouri], it was such a big deal but I just looked at, looked at him and said, and we went back for his funeral and I just sort of looked and said, "It's too bad your mom [Leana Peters Battle] and my mom aren't here to see this, they would have been very proud of that," and so would have all of those other generations that we talked about earlier.
