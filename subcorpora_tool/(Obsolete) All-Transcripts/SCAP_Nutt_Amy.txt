SCHNEIDER: 	So this Hannah Schneider and I’m here with Amy Nutt, for the Alumnae Oral History Project and where are you from?

NUTT:	I was born in Staten Island.  Lived there till I was four, until my family moved to Central New Jersey — Scotch Plains, New Jersey and that’s where I grew up before I came to Smith [College].

SCHNEIDER: 	And how did you come to Smith?

NUTT:	I came to Smith — my older sister is 15 months older than I am and, Eva, and I went with her, then, on her college tour, when she was looking, where she was going to go.  And she came to Smith.  We went to Bennington and so it was basically the northeast.  And she fell in love with Smith.  She didn’t get in, so she went to Mount Holyoke and I remember taking her up to Mount Holyoke and dropping her off and I cried all the way home.  So I think I wanted to be near my sister and I think I also felt, well, she loved Smith, therefore I’m going to love Smith.  So it was fairly accidental, but I applied early decision and got in and never looked back.  It was the most wonderful, accidental, serendipitous decision I’ve ever made.

SCHNEIDER: 	And what did it mean to you that Smith was a women’s college?

NUTT:	So this was, you know, 1973, the fall of 1973 — it meant a lot.  We were riding the second wave of feminism and Our Bodies, Ourselves was the, you know, actually that was still a few, perhaps a few years to come.  No, no, I think it was around that same time.  It was a feminist time.  The ERA [Equal Rights Amendment] was in the news.  It was about to pass and then stalled, with a few states I think to go.  So —
I was a very shy, very intellectual kid who wanted to study poetry and philosophy, which was a perfect place to do that was here.  So I wasn’t particularly political and I wasn’t particularly identified as feminist, but the ideas of, the idea of going to a women’s college was meaningful and it seemed right.

SCHNEIDER: 	And what did you end up studying?

NUTT:	I was a double major in English and Philosophy.  Yeah.

SCHNEIDER: 	And so talking about the student body a little bit, what did the — did you find that there was an average Smith student?  And like maybe what were they like?

NUTT:	The only thing average about a Smith student I think is a sense of curiosity and intellectual rigor.  I didn’t meet any intellectually lazy people at Smith.  I met a few people who took more time off and slept later and maybe skipped more classes, but who had an intellectual curiosity about them.  Maybe they weren’t finding it in the right place or they were still looking for it, but there was a sharpness to the minds here.  That was what I was, I craved that.
I went to public high school.  It was a good public high school.  I didn’t — but I was reading Camus and you know, it, it didn’t nourish me.  And the minute I got to Smith I was at home.  It was a place of just intellectual wonders and — and it was much more than that.  But I felt at home here and I think I felt at home with all the women here because they were, they were here for the same reason.

SCHNEIDER: 	Academically, what was your relationship like with your professors?

NUTT:	I had — my favorite professor, my advisor was Patricia Carter, who just sadly passed away a year ago.  She was a brilliant professor of English; her specialty was Gerard Manley Hopkins and romantic and Victorian poetry, which I fell in love with.  I took the course from her my freshman year and I did my honor’s thesis with her.  I actually did it with both departments; it was a Phenomenal Logical Analysis of the Poetry of Keats and Shelley.  They didn’t quite know what to make of it, but she was very supportive.
I took my first philosophy course with John [M.] Connolly and [Katherine Pine Parsons?] who co-taught and this was the fall of 1973 when John, who’s now retired, he had long hair and he was wearing Earth Shoes.  That was where you had the inverted heel and they were — I just was so lucky to hit the perfect people to spark and nurse that sense of wonder that I had and my love of poetry and literature and so you know, I felt — I mean, they were the two strongest relationships probably, academic relationships that I had but — I’m not sure I had a bad class.

SCHNEIDER: 	Do you remember, there was some, while you were here there was some tension over tenure and professors receiving tenure.  Do you remember anything about that?

NUTT:	I do.  I don’t a lot.  Yes, it was the two female professors.  For me, it was a little bit of, it was kind of in the background and so, I’m an undergraduate and I’m not really following it.  But I know it was, I know it was an important and difficult time.  Especially for faculty and obviously for those women.

SCHNEIDER: 	Jill Ker Conway?

NUTT:	Yeah.  So the wonderful thing about being at Smith in the class of ’77 is you got to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the college and its first woman president, so that was huge.  It just was a very exciting time and we were making history and that was really cool.  And 100 years of women on top and I remember the contest for the — for who was going to come up with the slogan and it’s nice to see that the t-shirts are still being made.  So yeah, it was, it was a very heady time.  I loved her memoirs.
In retrospect, because I’ve been reading recently sort of the history of that time, she was a conservative, a traditional academician, so she didn’t really believe in women’s studies and studies department and, and obviously she was of the time and the times changed.  But she, I believe, did really important things here at this college and set us up on the right track.

SCHNEIDER: 	So going into a little bit more of your social life, were you part of any organized on campus or any sort of (unclear)?

NUTT:	(laughs) I would love to say that I was.  But I wasn’t.  I certainly played intramural sports.  I am, in fact, infamous in a soccer intramural game for scoring a goal for the other team, although I was doing it, I thought, an advanced expert play; I was trying to kick the ball back to our goalie, who missed the ball.  So that’s a — and actually I was, I was on crew.  It was a [nacent?] team where our shirts that we wore for competition, we didn’t get to keep.  We had to hand them down to the next team.  It was a wooden shell.  We started out by rowing on the Oxbow, until we got a boathouse on the Connecticut, so it was really very much the beginning of Smith.
I went out for it with a lark because my, I was 5’2” and my best friend was 5’9” and so she was perfect and I thought, well, I’ll just go along, too.  So my first year I basically carried the oars and the sneakers and second year I got to row at the Head of the Charles, so that was my main outside activity.

SCHNEIDER: 	What was dating like at Smith?

NUTT:	Well, so — for me, understanding my sexuality, it was a little bit of a confusing time.  I was also extremely shy my freshman year.  I was so shy that, it was dinner style in the dining rooms where we had serving dishes and I was too shy to ask for people to pass the food to me.  So I would only eat what was like directly in front of me.  So my freshman year I actually lost weight.  Very anomalous; it was very hard to do.  But I came out of my shell (laughs) my second year.
I just hit the right crowd and — so dating — I had had a boyfriend briefly in high school and that continued.  I did go to some mixers my freshman year, so the drinking age was 18; it was a very different time and I experimented like all kids at that age, which means I drank too much.  And then quickly got over that.  But we, the Davis Student Center was where the student center was and they had beer on tap, so that was where you went after studying at night, was you’d go and get a beer.
My social life was really around the women.  I lived four years in Haven House and — you know, it took me a long time, but by my junior year I realized that I was probably a lesbian more than I was (laughs) anything else and had, began to have relationships and it was the perfect place to discover that.

SCHNEIDER: 	Did you spend a lot of time in town?

NUTT:	Not a lot.  You know, but certainly — because the drinking age was 18, we would go to, I remember Beardsley’s was a restaurant.  I remember having my first — oh, now I can’t remember the name of the drink, but it was like a girl drink, a cocktail.  It was mostly for that.  My senior year there was a — the only gay bar was on Thursday nights, was called — The Gala.  (laughs) On Thursday nights it was under like the railroad trestle on Main Street, just a tiny little bar and in the front room was the bar with the, some of these games and in the back room there was dancing with a jukebox and that was kind of where this small group of us would go.
This was a time that things were still, they were being talked about.  There was tension on the campus, but it was underground.  You didn’t really — the people who came out were the sort of much more outspoken, confident, radical people, but there were dances at Davis and I think that was a time when women who were lesbians or who were — wanted to be just with other women were finding that that was a safe place to be.

SCHNEIDER: 	Do you remember the Sophia Sisters at all?

NUTT:	The Sophia Sisters?

SCHNEIDER: 	Yeah.  They were a lesbian group on campus.

NUTT:	No, no.  And I didn’t, I didn’t belong to any of those groups because I was, I was still — I was a slow learner.  Even about myself.  So — yeah.

SCHNEIDER: 	So, before we get into some of the more like local things that were going on at Smith, I was just wondering if like what were the rules, the Smith College rules?  And did you ever break them?  Did you get into trouble at all?

NUTT:	Well, I certainly got high.  I mean — (laughs) I mean we would smoke dope in the hallways.  I mean — how the hell we got away with that I don’t know.  But — there was still a lot of the ’60s vibe.  The Vietnam War was still going on, early in our lives here.  Again the drinking age was 18.  There weren’t — I’m trying to remember the rules.  There weren’t parietals.  I don’t believe.  If men were not allowed overnight, if that was a rule, no one ever heeded it.  And I don’t remember anyone ever thinking they had to hide that.  So we were passed that.  We were just passed that.
And in fact, this was a time when there were no requirements for graduation — we were the last competent class because we had to take competence exams in our major and there were requirements in our major, but there were no general requirements.  You didn’t have to take a math course, so I never did.  I took logic.  You didn’t have to take a language and the only language I took was Latin.  And you didn’t have to take science, but I took geology.  So — so there was much more freedom in that sense, academically.  We didn’t have nearly the kinds of courses you guys have today, but we did have more freedom in that.
I will say, excuse me, the one thing I didn’t do, but a couple of people in our house did — this is what you do not have today is fire ropes.  There were no — how do you get out of the, if there’s a fire, I don’t know what they teach you today, if there are fire escapes, but in Haven House and in many of the old houses there were fire ropes in each room and it was a rope that was looped up, (laughs) it was looped on a hook.  So if there had been a fire you could use the rope out the window and so when we arrived at Smith everybody had to, freshman year had to pass the fire rope test.
And so we went down to — that was when Alumnae Gym was still being used, not a whole lot, but they had an upper track and we had to, there were fire ropes that they extended down over the track to the gymnasium floor and you had to go down.  You had to be able to go down the fire rope in order — it seems insane now and it seems like wow, a huge liability, to have all of these women (laughs) taking a rope down.  So consequently, there were a few times when some women did a little repelling (laughs) down in states, various states of inebriation and were never caught, so.  In the tradition of someone like Julia Childs who I know was a rabble-rouser herself, I don’t know if she ever did the fire rope, but she probably did.

SCHNEIDER: 	Out of curiosity, what house were you in?

NUTT:	I was in Haven House for four years.  Loved it.  Yeah.

SCHNEIDER: 	What was your house community like?

NUTT:	You know, it was wonderful.  It was a time, obviously every house had their own, had their own dining room.  Actually, there was something that we did.  We did break into the kitchen once and the only thing we could find were potatoes.  So we actually ate some raw — it’s pathetic.  I mean it’s — (laughs) like we were starving.  It’s really pathetic.  But hey, we found potatoes, so we would eat them.
It was, you know, Haven House was like 40 people.  So it was big enough that there was variety and there were different people and it was also all years.  I remember one of the seniors when I was a freshman and her boyfriend basically lived in her suite the entire year and he would set up the volleyball net and we would play volleyball out front on the lawn and — I had good friends in the year behind me.  And — it was a perfect location, too.  It’s the prettiest part of the campus, I think and you’re right near Paradise Pond and of course, take, we would go traying.  You’d take the big trays, the serving trays and slide down and almost kill yourself on the, onto Paradise Pond.  It was a very ebullient time.
Everybody found their niche.  And it was a great combina— I met people from the South.  I had never met anyone from the South, several people and Linda Bolton was the first African American I remember really sharing stories with and her roommate was Diane Sylvia, who was part Portuguese and grew up in that part of Boston, outside of Boston in Dorchester, or not Dorchester — yeah, I can’t remember.  I was meeting people — from backgrounds that I wasn’t familiar with and all of it was eye-opening.

SCHNEIDER: 	So I guess your life after Smith has been, it seems, very storied.  How do you feel, well, first of all, what have you been doing since then?  And do you feel that Smith has been involved in your life after your graduation?

NUTT:	Smith without my — I think without my knowing it, was a very powerful influence on my life and I think everything that I’ve accomplished in life, the groundwork was absolutely laid here.  I have a strange career path because my life was interrupted by mental illness.  And I was in two graduate programs at the same time in Boston in Philosophy and Literature, although they didn’t know it.
I was discovering my first, having my first manic episode.  I was eventually diagnosed bipolar but for the really 10, 15, almost 20 years I was in and out of mental hospitals while I was trying to get my graduate degree in Boston and did not succeed in doing that.  And basically went back home to live with my parents in my thirties and through the great good graces of one of my sister’s best friends, a Mount Holyoke [College] grad who was the chief of reporters at Sports Illustrated gave me a job as a fact checker.  I loved sports.  But I didn’t know anything about journalism.  Nothing, zip.  I’d never worked on the college paper, the Sophian.  Never worked on a high school newspaper.
It took me three years before I wrote my first story and I realized, I think I want to be a journalist.  So I went to journalism school at Columbia [University] while I was at S.I. [Sports Illustrated] and in their part-time program and when I finished in two years I realized, I loved sports but I didn’t want to be a sports writer the rest of my life.  I wanted to write about everything else.
And so my real career really began at the Newark Star Ledger in 1997 and I’m in my early forties.  So I feel like God owes me about 20 years of my journalism career.  I don’t think I’m going to get it back.  But becoming a journalist was a little bit like arriving at Smith; it was all of these wonders and I have never been bored a day in my life.
I’ve worked on some stories that weren’t as interesting as others, but I’ve never been bored.  In the way that I was never bored, I think at Smith.  Really.  You know, when I was at anything that I wanted to be at and — I basically discovered that I was curious about everything and everything that I learned here, every philosophy course I took, every geology course I took, all of it informed me as a reporter.
It made — and even the painful things in my life, it made me better at understanding other people.  It made me better at putting things in context.  The philosophy I studied here made me better at processing stories in my mind.  The literature I learned here was key to my ability to make analogies.  As a science writer, I depend on the skills that I learned in poetry classes.
Things that you don’t expect, that you only realize later, all of it, everything that happened here, every person I met, every conversation I had, every course I took has made me a better reporter.  Winning the Pulitzer Prize in — for Feature Writing in 2011 was a dream that I never thought would happen and I still pinch myself.  But the storytelling that I won that award for began here because you learn how to tell stories in classes and it was a skill that I picked up along the way but what drives stories is a sense of mystery and a sense of curiosity and that was, that was the gift that Smith gave me.

SCHNEIDER: 	That sounds like a pretty good note to end it on.

NUTT:	Sounds good.

SCHNEIDER: 	Thank you so much for every–

NUTT:	That’s OK.  I know.  I was–
