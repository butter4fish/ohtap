Speaker 2: No, I don't think she did, I don't think she did.  I just, I don't know, I never thought about why I loved her.  I guess I loved her because my dad was, was more positive and--he didn't let me have much freedom, so she would--she had a great big yard and I could play around in it and so, that's what attracted me, I think.

Says, "Well if you keep up with her you've gotta go some."  And he told me that, and she was a scholar, she graduated from the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], she taught school at--during that time she couldn't get a job teaching in--so she went to St. Louis [Missouri], got a job teaching there, St. Louis, Missouri.  But she was a scholar.  And my dad was just a high school graduate.

Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, before he moved to Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.

He went back after he took the examination, he went back home and then when he found he passed he came and got his job.  He did that for the rest of his life.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what about the post office, there some observations that you had about the post office in an article that you wrote last year, can you tell us some of those?
Speaker 2: I don't know, can't remember.
Speaker 1: Well you--I read that, that, white people called it Uncle Tom's Cabin?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they called it Uncle Tom's Cabin because there were so many blacks down there.  That was the only good job that a black person could get in Chicago.  And, you know, when my friends would ask me, "What does your dad do?"  I was proud to say, "He works in the post office."  Because that was something, I mean then.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, do you know any other information about your father's side of the family?  Is there anything else?
Speaker 2: Let me see, (pause) I, I, I'm not sure about anything so I'm afraid to say.  I think he had a brother, whose name was John and, I think John Palmer [ph.]; I don't want to say because I'm not sure.  I can't, can't be sure.
Speaker 1: Well, you know, even if you're not sure it doesn't, you know, if you say you're not sure it's all right.
Speaker 2: Well I think he worked at the Palmer House [Chicago, Illinois] and I think there's some connection between the name, the Palmer House, and his name, I don't know what exactly it is, but his name is John Palmer Mays and I--I can't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you're related to Lu Palmer [HistoryMaker Lutrelle Fleming "Lu" Palmer, II] (simultaneous)--

Speaker 1: Anything else about your family, any stories that your family tell about--about life in the 19th century or do they remember what things were like before the Civil War or after--right after the Civil War or anything about politics in Ohio?
Speaker 2: My, my granddad [George Mays], my father's [Stewart Mays] father--my--my father's grandfather was a slave owner.  And he had this son, my father's father bride, a slave woman.  And when the Emancipation Proclamation was signed, that was in Virginia, the father said, "I know you're my son, stay here and part of this plantation is yours."  He said, he didn't want any bit of it, he got on his horse and crossed some river, I don't--I think it was Ohio River and went to Bellefontaine [Ohio] and stayed there the rest of his life.
Speaker 1: Okay, well that's a good story, I mean, is there more?
Speaker 2: He founded that church in Bellefontaine, Ohio, that African Methodist Episcopal [A.M.E.] church.  He founded that church, and not--well, a few years ago they wrote me a letter and asked me for some information about it.

Speaker 2: I don't know, about them?
Speaker 1: Yes, about your ancestors in Bellefontaine, or, or your, your family in Bellefontaine.
Speaker 2: I had my grandmother's half-sister, her name was Hathcock [ph.], Eliza Hathcock and she came to visit--I don't know whether this is important or not, but she was a peacemaker, and she would--whenever they had arguments in the family she'd go wherever they were and try to settle them.  And when I visited her, there in Bellefontaine, and I told--I told her that--to come and visit me.  And I told her that if I--I'd like to write a book about her, and I still would, 'cause she was, just a wonderful person.  She was always going here, there and yon as a peacemaker.
Speaker 1: Just in the family or otherwise?
Speaker 2: Mostly family, and every--even the white people in Bellefontaine called her Aunt Lou [ph.], she, she cleaned offices, doctor's offices in Bellefontaine, they all called her Aunt Lou, and she was wonderful.  And I loved her and I would like to have written a story about her if I had time I would.
Speaker 1: Okay, anything else?  'Cause every time I ask you there's something else that's good.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I don't know.

Story_ID: 220320

Speaker 1: Well that's--it's good to know because a lot of people think that that kind of seg (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Bellefontaine, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot of people think that that kind of segregation just occurred down South.  So, it's good to know, that that, you know, took place in Bellefontaine, which is 'bout fifty miles from Cleveland [Ohio], I guess, right?
Speaker 2: (Nodding head)
Speaker 1: It's not that far away from Cleveland.  What is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I loved my mother [Clara Whetsel Mays], and I remember I thought she was going to die because she had the flu and I got on my knees and prayed and I--I don't want to talk.

That's--I don't know.

Speaker 1: Well sure it is, if you want to tell, if you want to tell it you can if you don't it doesn't make any difference.
Speaker 2: No, I mean, I couldn't talk--when, when I was in his history--taught United States history and I couldn't talk in his class because I was in love with him.  And when came time to give me a mark he couldn't give me one 'cause he said--I went up to his desk and I said, "Mr. Fitzgerald you didn't give me any mark--you didn't send in a mark for me."  He says, "How can I? You don't say anything."  And so I don't know but, he says, "What do you think I should give you?"  I said, "You should give me an E."  He gave me an E, an excellent.  I says, "I just can't talk in your class."  But that isn't important, that's not important, but anyway I was in love with him and I wrote a poem about him.  You wanna hear the poem?  "Above you'll find the photograph," I cut his picture out of a--one of our books.  I, I, put a--paste it on a piece of paper and I said, "Above you'll find the photograph of one I love quite well.  How only to the photograph can I my story tell.  I'd rather have the picture here and gaze upon his face then tell my heart sick story to some lonely empty space.  'Tis life the things we cherish most are those we dare not touch.  The trifles that are granted us are those we don't want much.  Forget--forbidden fruits are sweetest for they offer us the charm of novelty and I don't think they (laughter) do us any harm so to the giver let me say, give me my heart's desire this photo represents, the one, he whom I admire (laughter)."  That was in high school, but I don't know if we ever, I don't think I showed it to him (laughter).  But that's not important (laughter).
Speaker 1: No, that's a--it inspired--
Speaker 2: But I know--just one--
Speaker 1: --a poem.
Speaker 2: -- of those things
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay, now--
Speaker 2: And he became a principal of a school.  And I had a chance to go there and teach but I didn't go because I said, "Uh-uh."

She was a friend, we were good friends and he said, after I explained it, he said, "Miss Rommel, would you let a colored girl beat you?"  Exactly, (pause) I wrote some of that in there.
Speaker 1: I know, but we need you to tell the stories--

Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --you don't have to tell us everything--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: --that, that you gave us, but--
Speaker 2: And then, I wrote a--we were assigned to write a paper on whatever we wanted to write I guess, and I wrote a paper about--I've forgotten the name, but anyway, I, I, spent a lot of time in the library looking up information and wrote a paper and handed it in because I thought I needed a good mark.  And when I, when I got the paper back it had, "not acceptable" on there--and I was, "Not acceptable?"  The teachers name was Cabal [ph.], Miss Cabal, and I looked at that and I said, "What?"  I worked hard on this, so I went up to there and I said, "Miss Cabal, what's wrong with this paper, what's wrong with it--with this article?"  She said, "You didn't write it."  I said, "I wrote every single word of it."  And she said, "Well you come in after school someday and I'll see if you wrote that paper."  She gave me a time to come and I went and she put three subjects on the board and the first one was, "The Problem of Races in Chicago," and when I saw that I said, "Races, I've never been to a horserace in my life."  You know, she couldn't forget that I am not white.  And then she put some other things on there, but it dawned on me that she talkin' about the bad times black folks were havin' or some--and I wrote on that and I could just--just came you know, words just came because we were faced with restrictive covenants and all that stuff, so I wrote and I handed the paper in and she said, afterwards, "You have proven to me that you have the power of expression, and that's all."  But she did not think that I was capable of doing anything above average.
Speaker 1: Now that's the--that's the very definition of prejudice isn't it?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Right.  She didn't think you could do it because you weren't white.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Story_ID: 220328
Speaker 1: One thing, I forgot to ask you about, the riot [Chicago Race Riot of 1919] of nineteen--now were you here in 1919 when the riot--you, you were a little kid but--
Speaker 2: I was, yeah, I remember the riot we, we were under the bed (laughter) thinking some white folks were gonna kill us.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: It started out in the lakefront I think.
Speaker 1: Well tell us what you know about it from your perspective because you were here then and a lot of people weren't so, even--
Speaker 2: I don't know much about it except that black folk were stayin' in the house.
Speaker 1: How did the word get to you about it, so that--there wasn't any radio then or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I guess newspaper, I don't know, word of mouth, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Do you remember your father [Stewart Mays] talkin' about it or your mother [Clara Whetsel Mays] tellin' you?
Speaker 2: My dad probably, he was a mail carrier and he was probably getting the information from some people on the street.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you all stayed indoors, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We were afraid.
Speaker 1: Did you actually see any violence?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: I don't remember any violence.
Speaker 1: So I don't know if it was--was it all the way on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] too, were they, were people doing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think it was on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] mostly.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what I read, but I didn't know, you know.  It's good to ask, because you were actually around then.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You, you might've heard stories since that time that we would never know about.
Speaker 2: I have had other experiences with racism, but I can't think of them right now.
Story_ID: 220329
Speaker 1: When you were in high school [McKinley High School, Chicago, Illinois] what was your--did you have a career goal in mind, of what you were gonna do afterwards?
Speaker 2: No, I never knew exactly what I wanted to do, never, and when I graduated the only thing--the best job black woman--I could do would be to teach school, go in somebody's kitchen, I didn't want that, you know.  So I took the examination and passed and--it was just--I really, I wasn't--I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do.  Still don't (laughter).  I don't know--a lot of things I--I feel like writin' a book, now.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, when you--well tell me about high school graduation, what was it like?
Speaker 2: I can't remember--just caps and gowns.  I wasn't an outstanding student, I was just average, I wasn't--I had friends who, had a good friend who graduated with an average of ninety-nine her name was Vernell Moore [ph.] and I could never make that, you know, I mean, but she--she and I were good friends an she taught school and, and I taught school.  We were friends until (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was--
Speaker 2: --she died.  Huh?
Speaker 1: Oh was she an African American girl?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She got the highest mark that--ninety-nine she had and when she graduated from high school.
Speaker 1: Was she the valedictorian of the class or--?
Speaker 2: I don't know if she was valedictorian or not, but, she should have been.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Were there mostly black students in--at, at McKinley or, or was it mixed or what?
Speaker 2: No, it was mostly whites when I was there.
Speaker 1: Okay, what do you think the percentage of black students would be if, you know, if you had to guess?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What percent of black students were there, do you know, do you know?
Speaker 2: I imagine 'bout 10 percent maybe.
Story_ID: 220330
Speaker 1: So after you graduated [from McKinley High School, Chicago, Illinois] what did you--what did you do?  You took the exam you said for--
Speaker 2: Took the exam to--
Speaker 1: --teachers exam?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  And then I went to Normal--Chicago Teachers College [Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois] they called it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a three-year course and--didn't have any trouble and, you know, just I knew I was gonna have to work all my life (laughter) and I loved teaching and the last fifteen years of my teaching was on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] at, at, [Charles S.] Deneen [School of Excellence, Chicago, Illinois] on the 73rd [Street] and Wabash [Avenue].  And I had charge of graduation and we always put on a program.  We--I would write it and--it was all about the black struggle and I remember doing one about when [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] was killed.  I wrote a--in chorale speech I wrote a poem and was going to have the graduates do it and the superin- not, the superintendent, he was a--some person who was--what do you call 'em--any way he told the principal that--"I don't want her to do that."  And he was black, his name was Drayton [ph.].  His father was a, was a druggist, he says, "She can't do that."  The poem went like this, let's see, it'll come to me, but anyway, he told me--he told--and the principal came to me and says, "[HistoryMaker] Miss [Ruth] Apilado, Drayton says you can't put that on for graduation."  I says, "What?"  Says, "You can't do it."  I said, "We'll see about that."  'Cause it was nothing offensive about it, we'll see about it.  So I walked out of his office, he had me in the office and I went back to my room and a day or so after that he told me, I--he said, "You can go to the newspapers, you can go wherever you want to but you can't do that."  This is a white principal and a black man tellin' him no, and so, so then a day or so after that he came to me and told me, somebody must have told him somethin' cause he says, "Yeah, you can do it Miss Apilado, you can put that program on."  Let me see if I can remember it (pause) I don't know, I can't remember, my minds not good.
Story_ID: 220331
Speaker 1: I wanna ask you 'bout when you first started teachin', you know, what it was like when you first started.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I was--when I practiced teaching I went to a--they sent me to an all-white school and I remember a little girl asked me, she looked up and said, "Are you colored or white?"  (Laughter) I remember that--that's not important.
Speaker 1: It is important.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) But she wasn't used to black people being teachers, I guess that's what she meant.  I told her, "I'm colored."  Let me see, what else (pause) think about.  When I first started to teach?
Speaker 1: Now you, you substituted for a long time right?
Speaker 2: Six years, you had to have political pull to get an appointment and I didn't have any.   And all those that didn't have any--and they waited six years and then they, they assigned you to a school.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now what kind of political pull did you--
Speaker 2: I had none.
Speaker 1: --well did you get any to, together to be assigned to a school?  Did you have to get some together?
Speaker 2: Didn't have any.  I never had any political pull.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they finally just got tired of not--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I substituted for six years.  They send you here there and all over for--
Speaker 1: Well how, how did you finally get assigned to a regular school?
Speaker 2: Well they--everybody got assigned eventually to a regular school.  But if you had political pull you got assigned right away.
Story_ID: 220332
Speaker 1: And you were assigned to Hayes [School, Chicago, Illinois] first right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Permanent (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But that was my first assignment, I stayed there, that was permanent.  I stayed there for thirty-five years.
Speaker 1: And that's the school that you went to, grade school at Hayes School--
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --how, did that make you feel going back to Hayes?
Speaker 2: I, I loved it.  I told--I don't know if I put that in the story or not, it was a white teacher there her name was Travis, Loretta Travis [ph.] at--she was interested in writing and she used to come to my room at noon, you know, we had time off she'd be writing something and I'd be writing too and we became very good friends, she lived in Oak Park [Illinois] and I lived on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] and she asked me one day--did I have that in the story?  Did I have that in the story?
Speaker 1: Yeah, go head.
Speaker 2: I--she asked me one day, she says, "[HistoryMaker] Ruth [Apilado], come go home with me some--sometimes", she says, "I want you to meet my mother."  So I did--I went home with her and she live--her mother was nice, we talked and--nice person and then the next day (laughter) at school she came to my room, she says, "Ruth, do you know what my mother said about you?"  I said, "What?"  "She can't believe you're colored."  (Laughter) I didn't know she thinks so--I don't know, (pause) "She can't believe you're colored."  I mean that's relatively recent people thought blacks couldn't talk.
Speaker 1: You mean hold a conversation with white people in essence?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah and talk well.  An she and I were friends until the day she says--she called me up one day an she said, I don't know all of the conversation, but she said, "Ruth you know white people are more moral than black."  I said, "Yeah, that's why they raped all those black slaves down there in, in, in the South.  They're more moral than black."  The telephone clicked, that's the end of that--everything.  I've never seen her since and I have--I visited her, she moved from Oak Park to someplace else and I visited her, but when she said that to me--"You know"--and she believed that.  "You know that white folks are more moral than black."
Speaker 1: Do you think she'd ever thought about that about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know, I can't know--
Speaker 1: --how--
Speaker 2: --I guess she, she must have been stupid (laughter).  She must have been crazy, and here we--I had a house in Ohio.  I bought a home in Ohio just to go there while--when my mother [Clara Whetsel Mays] was living.  I took her up there, you know, we were real good friends.  'Cause we were interested in writing we were interested in the same things.  So--but when she said that, I says you're full--you're full of bunk.
Story_ID: 220333
Speaker 1: Now you started to write as a teacher, you were writing, you know, as well as teaching, right.  You were--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) doing them both?
Speaker 2: --why I started to write, I just, I don't know (pause) I'd come home and just write.  I don't know what I had in my mind my story was about a, about a family living in the ghetto tryin' to get out, they had so many problems.  That's the one that got the honorable mention, Midwest--Midwestern Writers Conference.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's, that's the one, 'The Joneses' [ph.] right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you--let's back track a little bit, now, now what year did you graduate from [McKinley] High School [Chicago, Illinois]?  Which one--
Speaker 2: Twenty-seven [1927].
Speaker 1: Twenty-seven [1927].  And--
Speaker 2: I think.  I think twenty-seven [1927], yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Chicago Teachers College [Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois] was?

Speaker 1: Thirty-two [1932]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know exactly the date.
Speaker 1: All right, and you started teachin' in the public schools in?
Speaker 2: Six years later.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that'll be 1938?
Speaker 2: Probably.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay, an--so, so when did you, you write the, the novel, 'The Joneses'?
Speaker 2: That just (shrugs shoulders)--I entered it in 1950, the Midwestern Writers Conference.  I went to Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois] for a while and--to see what's wrong with my writing and I went to class one day and the person who was head of the journalism department was gonna read some of the excerpts of what--from his students that he thought were commendable and I was sitting there and he read mine.  And then he read--I was shocked, and, and he said, "And this writer has a great deal of feeling."  And he wrote a comment on it when he handed it back to me, "Talent undeniably present", keep--see--keep, somthin', keep, keep writing.
Speaker 1: Now is this, is this prior to the novel or afterwards?  Is this before you wrote, 'The Joneses'?
Speaker 2: This is the novel, prior to the novel, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this was after 1950 or around 1950?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-hm.  Yeah, after, I, I think I went there to try to see what was wrong with my writing.
Speaker 1: Did somebody say, some, say something was wrong with it?
Speaker 2: No, but the fact that it didn't get a, a--Gwendolyn Brooks' approval (laughter) I says, "Well, I got to see what's the matter with this what--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Gwendolyn Brooks didn't like it, she didn't like your writing?
Speaker 2: No, I mean the kind of approval.
Speaker 1: Oh, the kind of, okay reception (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that her writing got.  Were you, were you sending your work out to publishers at that point--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't send it to anybody.
Speaker 1: --were you tryin' to get, okay.
Speaker 2: I never did, but my nephew [Dr. William Chester Jordan] who's at Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey] now, I gave him--he asked me for the book, he says, "[HistoryMaker] Aunt Ruth [Apilado] do you still have that?"  I said, "I still have it, but you can't do anything with it."  So I gave it to him and he hasn't done anything with it.
Speaker 1: Is that your only copy of it?
Speaker 2: That's all I had (laughter).
Speaker 1: Never give your only copy, to anybody.
Speaker 2: I wasn't thinking about it--
Speaker 1: Yes, but--
Speaker 2: --after that.

Speaker 1: That's somethin' because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But that other magazine [AIM, America's Intercultural Magazine] that I started right afterwards, I thought if I put my name at the bottom of the staff I could get people to work 'cause they push 'em up, they think they were--had more to do with it, you know, an, and I--because I was interested in the--in succeeding, but it didn't work.  I just did one issue of that.  I had some good articles in there.
Speaker 1: Well did--do you think it was a circulation problems or what, what do you think was the problem?
Speaker 2: I--just--people were not bothered much, they just--I don't know.

Speaker 1: I, I used to--I worked for, for [HistoryMaker Lutrelle Fleming] "Lu" Palmer [II] for a while.  Did you know [HistoryMaker] Ellis Cose?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Ellis Cose, yeah, right.
Speaker 1: He's a writer.  And he's on television, I mean I see his--on television.  He was in the office when I was working with Lu.
Speaker 2: Okay, did you work with Lu Palmer on the Black Express?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: His paper?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: After he left the [Chicago] Daily News he founded his own paper.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Black Express (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Black Exp- is that what he called it?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But, I told him that I was going to start my own magazine and Lu said, "That's hard, you--you know you, you, it's almost impossible."  You know, he tried--he discouraged me and he said, "If I were you I wouldn't do it."  But, I did it and, I haven't made any money, but I at least I don't regret it.  I got a--its part of my life.
Speaker 2: Okay, you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I would like to have been more successful.  I would like for everybody in the world to read it and I don't think it's a perfect magazine in, in the issue now, they got the word balloon spelled wrong, but, you know, I look in big shot papers and see misspelled words (laughter) but I am gratified, I am glad, it makes me sleep easier.
Speaker 2: Okay, so what have been the highlights of being a publisher of a magazine like this?
Speaker 1: The highlights?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the highlights, what, what have been the best part?
Speaker 1: I think, I think, I think we all have the obligation to try to make this world a better place.  Everybody, I feel it's my job, what am I living for?  I mean it!  And I've spent a whole lot of money doing it, and that's why I live in this shack (laughter).  I have friends who live in big nice houses, but, I have no regrets, really.
Speaker 2: Okay, so, how many issues do you publish a year?
Speaker 1: It was a quarterly.
Speaker 2: Okay, so it comes out four times a year?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Okay.

Speaker 1: Tell us about the trip to visit Senator [Theodore G.] Bilbo and how you--
Speaker 2: I really don't know, I went down South, I wrote a book, I don't know--when I moved I had all my writings in a closet and when I moved I had some, I don't know, but anyway, I called it 'Journey South' [Ruth Apilado] and I went down there and I was asking people all kinds of questions.  I remember knocking on a door of one woman's house--my son [Dr. Myron Apilado] was with me; about five years old, and I said, "Myron, you stand on the street, if I don't come out of this house you call the police."  This was in Mississippi, I said, we'll call the police, do somethin', I was so naive I really didn't know that they'd lynch him too, you know.  So, I knocked on the woman's door and I was questioning a lot of people and I ask her if she thought there would be segregation in heaven, she looked at me, she says--I knocked on her front door, an blacks were supposed to go around the back and she told me that first, but I said, "I just wanna ask you some--couple a questions."  I says, "Do you think blacks will be segregated in heaven?"  She says, "You know I never thought about that."  (Laughter) And I don't know what else, but I asked, I went down there--I went into one place where there were--a fortune telling place and they had up there for blacks and for whites, signs, you know, rooms where you go in to have your fortune told.  I was--but anyway she, the woman, I said, "What are those signs, what are they?"  She said, (whispering) "They don't mean a thing (laughter)."  She told me that they think it, when they come in but they don't mean anything
Speaker 1: So they're just two different doors but they led to the same place?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know, maybe she was just telling me to satisfy me, but that's what she told me.  But I, I talked to a whole lot of people in the South and just did.
Speaker 1: And this was--what was the time period when you were there?
Speaker 2: This was at student summertime, vacation time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, what year though?
Speaker 2: I don't know, my son was about five, six years old, so it's about sixty years ago (laughter), over sixty years ago.
Speaker 1: So this was in 1940s?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were--now you weren't part of an organization or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no--
Speaker 1: --anything, you just decided--
Speaker 2: I really don't know why, I asked myself many times, "Why are you doing all this?"  It was almost as if you--I was moved, you know, I don't know, I--but just, just did it.  Wasn't for publicity, I just wondered, my son said, "Mother you went into a place where they were"--they had lynched a black boy, they were having a trial or something.  He--I forgot that's what he told me, I forgot about that, said you were talkin' to somebody--I don't know, but anyway, I did it.
Speaker 1: And you went into a trial where somebody was on--
Speaker 2: A trial.
Speaker 1: --trial for lynching a black boy?
Speaker 2: I don't know the details of it now, I've forgotten but he told me, "You went in that--when they were--had lynched that colored boy and you were talkin' to some people about it."  I don't know (shrugs shoulders) just, just did it, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Now, you wrote that you went to, you--you either wrote or phoned Senator Bilbo, Theodore Bilbo of Mississippi--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --one of the most rabid segregationist in the South and the one who advocated lynching (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, and I went--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --called him, called his office and had--told me to come in whoever answered the phone, come in and have an appointment with him.  I had written an article in the newspaper down there about segregation.  I can't remember the article but any way I know Bilbo was staunch segregationist and I wanted to talk to him and ask him why.  Why, you know, and they said, "Come in and talk to him, they gave me a time to talk to him and come in."  And I went alone and I got in there and there wasn't a soul in the place, but he had read the article that I wrote and he wrote to me--I told you this.  He wrote to me and I got the letter, told me to get myself a job as a chairwoman because I couldn't write and, you know, I don't remember what the letter said, and I sent the letter to the Chicago Tribune and they published it and I asked them to please return the letter, they never did.

Speaker 1: Well I'm asking you because I need (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: --for you to say it on tape, you know, so.
Speaker 2: I got him to go to--my son [Dr. Myron Apilado] wanted him--my son was dean of St. Mary's School [ph.] up there in, in the west somewhere and Jesse went out there because I ask him and, and spoke and said--he got--pardon me--a lot of applause and I used to support PUSH, I use to sell the magazines right at the door of PUSH.  When--as they came in.  I got many subscribers from PUSH.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think I bought a magazine like that once.
Speaker 2: From me?

Speaker 2: Oh probably, you knew Bl--Henry?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so.
Speaker 2: Henry was--I got a book over there and he wrote a--he's got a collection of poems and he gave it to me, a book and he, he autographed it and says, "To my best friend [HistoryMaker] Ruth [Apilado]."  He and I were--he was good friend of mine.  He was--had some other ideas that I wanted to help him with, but he never got 'em.
Story_ID: 220341
Speaker 1: Okay, now I didn't ask you this, but how did you meet your husband [Inocencio Apilado]?
Speaker 2: I want--I wanted to get out of this country so I went to Crane [Tech High School; Richard T. Crane Medical Preparatory High School, Chicago, Illinois] at night at the same time that I was going to Chicago Teachers College [Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois], I went at night just to learn Spanish because I said, "I'm gonna leave this country," because of the prejudice here.
Speaker 1: This is Crane High School right, had a night school?
Speaker 2: I just wanted to learn the language so I went to Crane.  Signed up for Spanish class and he was in it (laughter) he was in Spanish class.  That's how I met him, I never got to South America, I was goin' to South America, maybe to Brazil or someplace where I thought there was not as much prejudice.
Speaker 1: So the, the idea of racial prejudice and discrimination really bothered you when you were comin' along--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--it really did.
Speaker 1: --probably more so than other people I guess, right?
Speaker 2: I guess so.  I could tell you lot of things that--stupid things that I did, you know, I think, I think that's the reason I married a Filipino because I--it was so bad being black let's try to be somethin' else, so I married a Filipino and at least my son [Dr. Myron Apilado] won't have kinky hair.  Yeah, I mean this--I know--I don't know--everything goes through your mind you know?  No, you don't know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, I, I know some of it.
Speaker 2: And that's why I think I--
Speaker 1: So you feel like this is just a--I mean you really felt persecuted I guess, in a sense?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I really did, and, and I don't know why I felt it any more than anybody else 'cause they were all treated the same.  But maybe some people don't react as I did.  I don't know, but a lot of people that hate discrimination.  I should have been with [Reverend Dr.] Martin [Luther King, Jr.]; I could have been with him.  I should have been with him I should have gone down there and marched with him.
Speaker 1: What happened that you didn't?
Speaker 2: I don't know why I didn't, I just don't know, I should have gone.
Speaker 1: Now, did you ever meet (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Like, like alderwoman, what's her name, [HistoryMaker] Dorothy Tillman?  She was with Martin, I did an article on her too, she talked about--and I thought, I should have been with Martin.
Speaker 1: Now, were you involved in any demonstrations here in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I don't remember being--demonstrating, I--my nephew got in some difficulty with, with some kids, you know, an, and I think I put that in there, and he--they roughed up a white man and the man died and he had to go to prison.  He was a juvenile I think, anyway I went and talked to the judge about him and the judge told me, "That was a white man they killed!"  You know, just like that, as if it made a difference, and to him it did.
Speaker 1: So that, that sort of superseded the juvenile court, I mean the whole idea of havin' a juvenile court, they sent him to prison--
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't know exactly what his age was, but I know, I know that he was with some other--and they roughed up this man in an alley and I don't approve of that at all but I thought the sentence was too harsh to send these kids to, I don't know how long they got, but he went, spent his time, came out and didn't do any better.

I should have been there, I wish I had gone, I could have gone 'cause anything I want--made up my mind to do I did it, but I didn't go there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I'm not, I'm trying now to be what--where I think people should be as far as different races are concerned.  I go to the Chinese place--Chinese buffet and I did and--I gave them an ad and talked to the people and really enjoyed talkin' to the Chinese--and have all kinds of people there, I enjoyed talkin' to them and I feel like I'm one of them--I am.

Speaker 2: Although he's old, old, old too (laughter).  He's seventy-one.
Speaker 1: Okay.

I found it, he's an outstanding golfer and he's an artist, he can draw, he can paint and he's a violinist, he won first prize, he played the violin on WGN [WGN-TV, Chicago, Illinois] they had some kind of a--and he played it, played the violin, won second prize, he played with the [Chicago] Youth Symphony [Orchestras, Chicago, Illinois]  in Chicago and I think he's more of a--what am I, what would you call me?  He's more of what I want to be than I am.  He's interested in fair play for everybody.

Speaker 2: Well he's made enemies, not friends, I can't, I don't like him, I don't like him for the way he was elected, that--I wrote a, I wrote a--my cover story when that--when he won that election, I guess Al Gore, I think it was really a good piece and my son [Dr. Myron Apilado] said, "Mother I wish I could write like that."  The last sentence was, let me see, I don't know but I told him he ought to feel very uncomfortable in the president's chair.  That really angered me that Florida thing--

I hid the letter (laughter), I said, I'll put it here 'cause I'm gonna use this letter and I couldn't find it.  Oh, Dan Rather, Dan Rather.  See how it comes, that's when you get old that's what happens.  Dan Rather, he wrote to me and I bet, I bet if I write him again he would remember 'cause he said, "Thank you for saying all those nice things and sometimes perhaps in the near future I'll help you."  I sent [President William Jefferson "Bill"] Clinton five thousand dollars when he was runnin', but they returned it, did, did I send that to you?

I , I don't think--it's just I can't help it, I swear to God I can't help it.  I didn't--I have quite a few subscriptions from prisons.  I did an article on, on prisoner being in jail for thirty-three years, I wonder--he didn't tell me what he did, I know it was murder but, but, you know, but he--you can tell by the way he writes that he has some substance some good substance but then he calls me his--he calls [HistoryMaker] Margaret Burroughs a cowgirl and he calls me a cowgirl.

And I--that's all--but, they didn't have any money and all they faced was discrimination, they couldn't solve their problem.  I have to read it to find out what (laughter) what I did.  Her name--I call her Rabbit, her name was Rabbit because she had the clef-palate.  She lived in the ghetto but that's a book that's on the person at Northwestern University [Evanston, Illinois] was reading to the class.

I said, "Oh, you can't do anything with it."  He says, "You don't know what I can do."  Because he's printed, he's got, what do ya call 'em? People contact to get the books printed?

I remember I picked up a, a, piece of paper like a bill or something an I thought it was a dollar bill and it was just a advertising something, you know I was probably about eight and I couldn't read and I took it into a Chinese laundry place and I asked the man he would give me change for a dollar (laughter) I was dumb, he ran me out of there, he said, "Get out," (laughter).  And then I remember I did--there was a Jewish lady, I used to play in the vacant lot by her, she had a cleaning store, I used to play there and she told me to get out of there and don't be playin' I might break her window with some rocks or somethin'.  So I told her, "You, go to hell," and she went right over to my dad [Stewart Mays] and she said, "That little girl of yours told me to go to hell," he gave me the worse whippin' that I never did forget it.  He beat me, he says, "You don't talk to anybody like that, you never say that again."  I was just--I don't know why I did it.  I just-- you know, I had heard somebody else say it.

I went even after he married that woman, I went to him when he was sick, whenever he got in trouble she would call me and she, she, knocked him down the stairs once, broke his ankle, she called me to take him to the hospital.  I--he had glaucoma as I do and I used to go there every morning and put drops in his eyes, 'cause I thought it was difficult, it's not very difficult because I have to put them in my eyes.  And I thought, you know, when he had it was difficult so I would go every morning I went to put drops in his eyes and, and I tried to be his friend although I loved my mother [Clara Whetsel Mays] more.
