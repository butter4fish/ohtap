 Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Saturday, June 13, 2009. We   re in Stillwater,  Oklahoma at the Stillwater Public Library interviewing Walter E. Price.  This interview is being conducted as part of the Spotlighting Oklahoma  Life in the 1930s Oral History Project. Thank you for joining us today.  Let   s begin by learning a little more about you. Can you tell me a little  bit about your early life, where you grew up, your family?  I was born in Tulsa and lived in Tulsa until I was seven years old. The  Depression hit in    29, but the Depression was somewhat delayed in  Oklahoma as many people will tell you. It hit us about 1933 because my  dad was in the lumber business and the building industry just collapsed.  So we moved up to a farm that we owned up near Pryor because you  could survive on a farm. I was seven when we moved up there and  stayed up there till I was ten. My biggest remembrance of the  Depression was those farm years because not only did we have  Depression, we also had a serious drought. Not Dust Bowl, which was in  the panhandle, but our second year out there we had a very serious  drought.  Before we moved to the farm. I remember going to Lincoln School and I  remember going down to the lumber yard and the workers down there  would make me rubber guns and I could crawl all around the lumber  stacks   it was an old fashioned lumber yard. You don   t see many of  those anymore. But I also remember where we lived. We lived out on  south Quaker which was north of Maple Ride, north of Swan Lake, near  Woodward Park. A very happy life, the same neighbors for years and  years. My mother was from a huge family of thirteen children and my  dad was from a family of six children. So a lot of relatives, a lot of them  there in Tulsa. But I don   t remember hard times until 1933 and then my  folks explained to me that we had some financial problems, and that   s  when we moved to the farm. I remember sitting out at the end of our  5  walkway and watching the so-called Okies come by on their way to  California. I remember going to auctions with my parents and these  auctions would start in the morning and they   d go all day long and they  would sell canned goods, they would sell empty jars, canning jars, they  would sell the livestock, harness, furniture and generally it was cash and  they would keep this money and if they owned the land, they would  auction the land off as the last item. Lunch was generally put on by  church ladies. At the end of the day, these people were out of business if  they were tenant farmers and they would spend the night with friends  and the next morning off to the West. If they owned the land, it was a  little bit different, it took a little bit longer.  I remember going to an auction where a forty acre farm with a house and  all the out buildings sold for  1400. We got twelve cents a dozen for  eggs at the store, but we had our own garden and what not. I remember  people walking by; hobos or people out of work would come up to the  house and they   d see a pile of logs out in these wood piles   we had big  logs and you would go out there when you got time and you would saw  them up for wood to put in the fire place. We didn   t have running water.  We didn   t have electricity. But people would come up and see the wood  in the wood pile and they would volunteer to go over and cut wood up  for several hours just to be fed lunch. I remember the wages, you got a  dollar a day for shocking wheat, all day long. You got three dollars a day  if you were a stonemason. Think what you would pay a stonemason  now, if there are any left. I remember when we had some rain and we  got behind schedule on shocking wheat and my dad was very upset  because he had to take a stonemason who was building the cow barn and  take him down into the field so we could catch up on shocking wheat. So  he was paying him at three dollars a day, high wages, to shock wheat.  The thrashing crews in those days, you didn   t have combines and you  cut it, shocked it and later you picked up the shocks, took them to the  thrashing machines. That   s when you had the big straw piles and what  not. I worked as a young kid, I moved to the farm when I was seven, as I  said, and I would work as a water boy with my horse and two earthen  jugs wrapped in burlap. I would go to the well and I would fill them with  water and dip them in the water so that the evaporation of burlap would  keep the water cool and I would just ride my horse from shock to shock  wherever they would hold up their hand to give the workers water. The  way they thrashed wheat is generally they combined a group of farmers  and some would shock, some would drive bundle wagons, some would  drive grain wagons. Then they would hire a thrashing machine to come  in and he would do six or seven farms for these people that had grouped  together with a thrashing crew. Not nearly sophisticated as it is now, but  the wages, I don   t know what they paid the thrasher to come in with his  machine. I know what the laborers got a dollar to a dollar and a quarter a  6  day. The stonemasons and skilled laborers got three dollars a day.  I remember the people were proud but destitute. We were in a little bit  different situation because we still had some city money and our    cash  crop    was our home in Tulsa. We rented that for  75 a month and that  was a biggest cash crop because it was hard cash every month. And that  house now in Tulsa would rent for  900 to  1000 a month, easy.  Country school, that was interesting too. But I would ride my horse and  do this thrashing. Kids worked a lot on farms. They worked at jobs they  could do. The first thing I remember being able to do was drive a rake,  because it was a very simple one team operation to rake hay and then  dump it in the windrows. But getting back to the Depression part, it was  unbelievable, the amount of unemployed; the most prosperous man in  the county, I always thought, was a guy named Woody who was the  rural mail deliverer because Woody got paid a salary plus mileage. In  those days, a guaranteed income was just like gold. Very, very little cash  and everybody was looking for a job. The wages, a hundred dollars a  month for a man with a family was a good job.  You   d go into town sometimes on Saturday, that   s when everybody took  stuff in to sell and they bought stuff. People wore their clothes until they  were just shreds. Now we had such a big family on my mother   s side  that we had a    clothing chain    for outgrown stuff; I got my cousin Otto  Junior   s clothing. His dad was head of the FHA in the state of Oklahoma  or whatever it was called then. A big government job, so they had  money and lived in Nichols Hills in Oklahoma City, but I got Otto   s old  clothing. My cousin Clayton, who is now a millionaire in Tulsa, got  mine. My brother was odd leveled so my brother always got new  clothing.  I remember when the social security came in. My dad thought that social  security was socialistic and like a lot of businessmen, he sincerely  opposed it. He thought it was horrible. He thought all of the Roosevelt  programs, initially, were very, very dangerous. Businessmen were  scared to death of Roosevelt, but over time my dad became very, very  supportive of a couple of programs. One was a Civilian Conservation  Corps  CCC . That was these young boys, I think they got  25 a month,  they kept  5, they lived in a camp, they sent  20 of it home. Magnificent  program and that program combined with Soil Conservation, my dad  thought that was wonderful. They built ponds, they did terracing, they  sodded grass. It was a wonderful program and much different from  today. The Roosevelt approach was he would find the people that  needed jobs and they would get jobs and then they   d figure out  something for them to do. And oh there were a lot of jokes about people  that were raking leaves on courthouse lawns and whatnot, but there was  also things like the Soil Conservation and CCC that were wonderful  7  programs. They built armories, they built schools   Will Rogers High  School, Webster   s High School in Tulsa are WPA  Works Progress  Administration  projects. But social security came out in 1935 and it is  amazing the number of people today that have no understanding of what  the original purpose of social security  was . It   s been so changed over  the years. But it was basically to give you a first leg on your retirement.  All the other stuff has come along later, but it was never meant to be  total retirement. But the WPA started during that time.  The WPA, we saw that mainly in the form of buildings and dams and  schools, but there was a lot of bad publicity on the WPA and there was a  lot of politics in the administration of it, but it at least got people out  working. After we   d been on the farm about three years (we were going  to a school that had the first eight grades in one room). My folks were  concerned. I was about to enter the sixth grade, my brother was about to  enter the eighth grade, so they thought it was time to get back to Tulsa  and things in Tulsa had loosened up a little bit by that time. That was  1936 when we moved back. When we moved back to Tulsa, my dad  worked a couple of salary jobs at one time and he had some investments  that he worked on. He and my mother (primarily my mother) got  involved in real estate. And I   m not talking about real estate like today.  My mother would buy a house over in north Tulsa, a little two story  house, and she would go in and she would make one half of the house   26 a month and she would fix the other half of the house at  28 a  month and they would share the bath. Then upstairs was  35 a month,  but with the wages and level of income, that ended up being pretty good  money. And then she would buy another house and buy another house  and when she got too old to manage it many years later, I sold all of her  property for her and it was amazing the property that she had  accumulated.  Now people would say,    How could you buy property in the  Depression?    Well the banks had foreclosed on all of this property and it  was carried with them and other real estate, they weren   t getting a dime  for it. They would sell it immediately to someone that had a good credit  rating because then they would start getting return   payments. So my  mother bought this property. She could go down to the bank and borrow  anything she wanted to buy this property and she always paid it off. She  kept good track of it. Worked hard, worked very hard. I used to get a  kick out of my mother because she got tired of paying a paper hanger, so  she bought a set of paper hanging tools and taught herself to hang paper.  And I can remember I did lawns for her. I would get a dollar and a  quarter over on North Cheyenne doing three complete lawns and that  was with a push mower, not even electric. It was completely push  mower. The blade was run by the wheels. And edging it and trimming it,  I got a dollar and a quarter and lunch. But I did a lot of that for my  8  mother and did a lot of work for her on the property. My dad used to  joke about it because he was an old lumberman and he had everything,  just exact   certain distance between two by fours and what not. My  mother would cut corners. She would take Celotex and if she could  stretch it out to a yard instead of sixteen inches she would do it. But she  created a real empire of real estate that lasted for a long time.  I have seen my mother at four o   clock in the afternoon in a house dress  barefooted papering a wall of a house in north Tulsa and then three  hours later, she would have gone home, cleaned up and she would be all  dressed up and would be at some nice reception with all of her society  friends. How she kept up I   ll never know, but she never let down on all  of the clubs she was in, her sorority, UDC  United Daughters of the  Confederacy , DAR  Daughters of the American Revolution  and  everything. But when she was working, she just worked like a field  hand. I have a great, great respect for my mother. Later on my dad was  elected Police and Fire Commissioner of Tulsa and then he was elected  Mayor of Tulsa but all the time that she would be going to these various  functions, she was also doing all of this gut work on this property.  Now when we were back in Tulsa in    36 I was in high school. There was  an awful lot of people that were really still in very, very hard times;    36  to    39 were hard times. I   ll always remember a wealthy oil family, I  won   t mention their name, but I always liked them because they were  super rich. During the Depression, they acted like they didn   t have  money because they were embarrassed by the fact that they were rich  and drove big cars and all and everybody else was struggling. And  everybody was trying to get by. The jobs for young kids were pretty  much limited to paperboy which is what I did. I delivered the Tulsa  Tribune and the Tulsa World. I would deliver the Tulsa World seven  days a week at four o   clock in the morning. I would collect twenty cents  and I would collect it on Friday night and of that twenty cents with the  World, I got to keep seven; when I was doing the Tribune I got to keep  five and a half. But the paperboys were the guys that had pocket change  at Tulsa Central because making two or three dollars a week on a paper  route gave you great pocket change.  I can remember the struggles that people had and at one point in there,  around    38,    39, they came out with the peace time draft   military draft.  And that   s a whole other story, the build up to World War II. One of this  country   s greatest achievements was when we went from nothing to the  Army we had, but that   s another story. But those boys got drafted to go  away for a year. And they renewed it in Congress by one vote, I think it  was, some of those people that were in the one year peace time draft  didn   t come home for six years because the war happened. There were  people in    39 and    40, along in there, that thought we were going to be  9  able to avoid the war, but most people felt like we would eventually get  into the war.    41 we had, of course, Pearl Harbor and my folks thought I  needed to get some military training. I went to Oklahoma Military  Academy in Claremore. I graduated from high school there and stayed  there for one year of junior college and then I went on off to the service  and I stayed in the service. In    46 when I was about to be mustered out I  went to West Point and stayed on for a career and retired in the  seventies.  There   s so many stories on the Depression on seeing how people  operated. Now, I have one thing that I tell people   I can spot them a  mile off   there are not a lot of them anymore, but people with the  Depression syndrome. My dad had it and my father-in-law had it. The  Depression syndrome was that after things cleared up, if you   d been  through the Depression, one thing you did is you kept huge checking  accounts. You didn   t get in debt. You saved everything and you can spot  these people. I   ve gone down with my dad to make deposits and loan  payments, and I   ve see him make savings deposits at five percent, then  he   d go over and make payments on houses that were due and these  payments might be seven percent. And I   d say,    Why don   t you take  several thousand here out of your savings and pay off these?    His  answer was,    I like to keep them separate and you   ve always got to have  a little cash,    because during the Depression, cash was king. People  suffered horribly because they had no cash. And the old Depression  people, you can spot them a mile off, they   ll keep these great big  checking accounts.  I went one time, not too many years ago, going over to Tulsa to help my  mom mow lawns and keep things up even though I had retired and was  living in Stillwater, a grown man with grown children. But I   d go there  and help her with lawns and maintenance of some of her stuff and  finally, we sold it all off and she became just on a cash basis, but I went  into her bathroom and there was a hose that went up out of her bathtub  and out the window and she was draining her bathwater   siphoning     down into a flower bed that she had built below the window where she  had tomatoes and what not. That is because she had remembered in the  Depression when we would drive four miles in a wagon with three 55-  gallon drums to Seminole Creek to fill them up to water cattle after our  wells had both gone dry. Ponds dried up during the drought and we  would draw each well dry each day and then we would go haul this  water. My mother just remembers carrying buckets of water to wash and  she never forgot that. There are not an awful lot of those great older  generation people left now, but they had this thing, as I say I called it     the Depression syndrome.    That   s kind of an overview of my  remembrance of the Depression. You have any questions or anything  about it?  10  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Before you moved to the farm in Pryor, you primarily moved there  because of the Depression?  Of the Depression, sure. My dad had a lumberyard and just nobody was  building anything and he sold it to a larger company. I remember when  we went to the farm, we built a little house that we lived in   two  rooms   and the whole family lived there until the tenant farmer that was  on the place brought the crop in, that   s the way they did it. And then  when he brought the crop in, he moved on and we moved into the big  house and used that little house as a hired hand   s house.  And the big house you built, did it have electricity or no?  No, no.  And you had electricity in Tulsa?  Oh, of course.  So it was kind of a big change?  Oh, horrible change. A horrible change. Where we lived in Tulsa, now  are you familiar with Tulsa? Goodness gracious. Woodward Park, Maple  Ridge   very, very lovely area. We had just a modest little house, but it  was in an extremely good area. Oh yeah, it was a horrible transition.  Getting up in the middle of the night to go to bathroom, you walked two  hundred yards up to a privy. When you did your washing, you had a  gasoline engine driven washing machine. You hauled the water up by  hand and poured it into the machine. It was a tremendous transition.  Did you have brothers and sisters?  Sure. One brother and we loved the farm which is interesting. I   m sure  my folks   and they were good sports about it   but I am sure that this  was very tough on them, living on the farm. But my brother and I loved  it. But we saw destitute people all around us. A lot of tenant farmers.  There were also people that owned farms. But the combination of the  drought and the Depression was just deadly.  Did your family have a garden?  Oh, sure. We had two gardens. We had one garden that supplied us and  then we had a larger garden that was supposed to produce stuff to sell. It  was about an acre. Our farm was about two hundred acres. There was a  hill behind it and my brother and I spent a lot of time up there on the  hill. The day we moved into the big house after the tenant farmer left, all  11  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  the kids from the school (which was a rural school, eight grades in one  room) came up and helped us carry up our furniture down to the big  house. To reward them for this, my mother bought them all tops. I don   t  know if you remember tops, you wind them up and throw them and they  spin. This was a tremendous gift for them and they were a tremendous  help for us too.  On the farm, what type of meals do you remember?  Oh, an awful lot of chicken dinners, because if a chicken got run over on  the highway   Highway 20   and we saw it run over, we could go pick it  up and my mother would pluck it and we would eat it. If you found a  dead chicken, you couldn   t do that because you didn   t know what it died  from. But, oh no, we ate like kings. We butchered our own beef, we  butchered our own hogs and without refrigeration, the butchered meat  was put in a smokehouse, but it was salt cured. You cured it with salt  and then when you used that meat you had to soak the salt off because  there was no refrigeration. We occasionally had an ice box that we used  where we could buy ice in town. But we had gas for awhile and then the  gas line was not profitable for the gas company, so they plugged it. We  had gas lights for awhile, but not very long. Fireplace for heat, coal oil  stove to cook on.  So what would you do for fun?  Oh, for fun. The biggest thing we did was chase goats because there was  a guy that ran a rodeo and he had a bunch of goats that they used for  roping. When the rodeo went broke or something and he closed it, he  took all these goats and turned them loose on his land which was back  up behind us. It was a hill and kind of a plateau on top of the hill. There  was two or three generations of these goats and they became feral. We  chased them all of the time and we   d catch one every once in awhile and  then fix the wagon and hook it up. We   d chase snakes up there. We  hunted. My goodness, there were caves to crawl in. It was fun for a kid.  Pie suppers, you   d go to the school and take a pie and someone would  buy the pie and that   s the person you sat with for dinner. Now that was  the older folks. Christmas, you had a big Christmas tree down at the  school and everybody in the county got a gift. Somebody donated   one  year a man donated a bunch of rubber pistols, rubber gun pistols and that  created a furor because some of the people didn   t want their kids to have  guns. The country school was interesting.  Do you remember what it was called?  Osage. It   s still there. Not that building, but Osage School is still there.  Mrs. Pierce. And we would go once a year to Adair to kind of a field  12  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  day. I always went as a reader. I would enter the reading contest and  they would have a track meet and they would have spelling. But it was a  whole day of both academic and physical activities. I remember when  we got a basketball backboard at the school. Dirt court, pole and we had  a makeshift ring. And finally they got enough money together to buy a  ring and they built a backboard, a good backboard and they bought a  commercial ring. And you would have thought that we had just finished  Boone Pickens stadium. We had a basketball goal. That   s one of the  reasons we had such good basketball players in Oklahoma because it  only took limited ability to put together a basketball court.  The big house on the farm, were you still there when it received  electricity?  No, we left before we got electricity. It was a very common type. It was  a stone front, two great big rooms and then two rooms above that and  two level porches and then back behind was a dining room and kitchen.  Great big rooms. The two big bedrooms downstairs had fireplaces and  then there was a wood stove in what was the dining room and the family  room and then there was the kitchen.  Back in Tulsa, do you remember listening to the radio?  Yes.  And what were some of the things you listened to?  The Eddie Cantor Show, Jack Armstrong, the All-America Boy, Buck  Rogers, later on Superman, Amos    n Andy, two black comedians; later  on Bob Hope, Fred Allen   the radio was your sole little television. On  the farm, we had to have battery radio. And also our telephone was just  one line down Highway 20 and our ring was one long and two shorts so  whoever wanted to call us it was (makes ringing noise) and then we  would answer the phone and everybody in the county would be listening  to you. But you didn   t have your individual   you had your ring, but  everybody could listen in. I remember one time one of the Spencer boys  who was one of our hired hands was on the phone, he told everybody to  stand back because he was going to blow the dust out of the line.  (Laughter) You just can   t imagine how those people lived on how little  they had.  Well I   m sure being on a farm somewhat helped.  Oh, tremendous help. Yeah. But many of them couldn   t make it because  we had the drought, we had the Roosevelt programs, we started then  being paid to sell hogs that they killed to keep the price up, but oh no,  13  Nykolaiszyn  Price  our goal is twenty bushels to the acre on wheat and a dollar a bushel.  Think of that now. But we didn   t fertilize it and we didn   t   you know  you lost a lot of grain in the process of cutting it, shocking it, carrying it  to the thrashing machine. My dad never thought that combines would  work; he thought the grain would ripen and fall before you could get the  combine in. He was not an experienced farmer, but he was very  interested in conservation and very interested in farm products being  used commercially. He was kind of a thinker on the farm thing. He had a  lot of ideas like that.  My mother wanted implements to be painted. She would paint the  implements. And that   s the classic Oklahoma farm   finished drilling the  wheat in and park the drill, leave it there until the next year; when you   re  ready to go out and the feed the grain box was rotted and you had to  redo that and you had to redo the tubes that took it down to where it  dropped on the ground. We always took ours up and put it into the sheds  to protect it. I remember years later when I was in Germany and I  thought how they save every little thing and how wasteful we were. We  weren   t, but how wasteful the Oklahoma farmers were. And their places  were horrible. If they threw a can out, they just left the can there. It was  just horrible. We bought a manure spreader and they thought we were  crazy because this was a thing you hooked to the back of the wagon, you  took the manure out of the stalls of the barn and throw it in there and  leave it out on the field and this thing would churn up the manure and  throw it up. But there were times when you got zero crops during the  drought period. We had wind and dust storms, but we didn   t have  anything like they had up in the panhandle. But it was horrible. There  was no water.  Would your family often help people who came through as they were  heading to California?  Very much so. What we ran into was the walkers, people would walk  by. They would come up and say,    Lady,    (my dad would be out  working)    Lady I haven   t eaten all day yesterday. Could you give me  some food?    And my mother would say,    Well sure.    And that   s another  thing. She would take this stranger into the kitchen and feed him, sitting  right there at our table, feeding him. And my goodness you wouldn   t do  that now. You   d be scared to do that. However, we had a German police  dog named King and if he would even make a gesture towards my  mother, King would have torn him apart. But if she had work to do, she  would let him do it and sometimes she would tell the hobo,    No we  don   t have anything to do but I   ll feed you.    Or give him something to  carry with him. An awful lot of that went on among those people. A lot  of loaning of things.  14  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  What were holidays like?  Well holidays for us were generally going back into Tulsa for Christmas.  But at the farm, Christmas was the big deal down at the school. The pie  suppers, they had two of them, they would raise the money to provide  the big Christmas celebration. And we provided the tree a lot of times  for the Christmas celebration because we had a lot of cedars we were  clearing out.  Were your parents born in Oklahoma?  No, my mother was born in Mississippi. And she was, I think, the last of  the thirteen children born in Mississippi, the remainder, and she was  about seventh, but the remaining three of her thirteen brothers and sisters  were born in Tulsa. My dad was born at a railroad siding in Kansas on  his way to Tulsa in 1893, I think. My grandfather had come to Tulsa,  liked it, went back and a few years later brought his family. They  originally started in Tennessee, but they came to Tulsa via Missouri. As  a matter of fact, one of my aunts was named Tulsa. Not a nickname, but  she was named Tulsa and that was before they got here, but he liked the  sound of the name.  And how did the farm come into the family   s ownership?  Gentlemen farmers (it was kind of a joke in Oklahoma) but people  would buy farms, that was kind of a thing with people. And one day my  dad and my grandfather   I didn   t live to see my grandfather, I was two  years old when he died. But they were driving by and they saw the farm  for sale; they stopped and liked it and bought it. And then they made  every mistake that you could possibly make as a town owner of a farm.  They bought a small thrashing machine, they bought stuff. They wasted  a lot of money because they were providing stuff and they didn   t know  anything about it. But it came in good later on, because later on we were  using the farm, but for many years they just owned it. And when we  moved up there, my dad owned half the farm plus a child   s share of the  rest of it. And they had to have a little friendly lawsuit to get that all  squared away and my dad ended up owning the whole farm, but had to  reimburse his brothers and sisters.  Well that was smart thinking.  It was coincidental on the farm. The farm was bought when they had  money and were prosperous and they wanted to have a country place.  And it came in handy.  15  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Came in handy.  Do you remember when The Grapes of Wrath came out?  Absolutely and I detest it. It   s the worst thing that ever happened to  Oklahoma. And for libraries to have celebrations of The Grapes of  Wrath is just stupid. One, it   s inaccurate, because we didn   t have the  bulldozers bulldozing down the house. That was in a little bitty part of  the panhandle and Kansas and Colorado and Texas. We had drought  which was bad enough, bad, bad drought. But The Grapes of Wrath was  in Sallisaw. That was not part of the Dust Bowl. Now I saw the Sallisaw  people, just like the Joads, I saw them come driving by on Route 20,  Highway 20, with everything they owned on the car. I   ve never liked the  idea of The Grapes of Wrath. Never did. It set the state back. It took  them thirty years to overcome it.  What did your parents think?  I don   t really know. I never really talked to them much about that. My  folks    main goal during the Depression was to keep our lives as normal  as possible. And I have great admiration for them because I   m sure they  suffered a lot more than we realized. I can remember people at Tulsa  Central when we got back to Tulsa who had had money and they  continued to try and live like when they had had money. I knew one  couple that still had a chauffeur and they couldn   t anymore afford a  chauffeur than anything. Hit the people in Tulsa a lot of   I can  remember a housing addition in Tulsa that just closed down. It   s now  one of the best areas in Tulsa, but at that time they got the land bought  and they couldn   t finish it. Had the little bridges in the driveways and  everything, but they couldn   t finish the property.  Did your family get together and listen to Roosevelt on the radio?  Yes, he did his fireside chats when he would talk and in the newspaper,  there was an awful lot about Roosevelt. And Mrs. Roosevelt, I saw Mrs.  Roosevelt in two different situations. Once, I saw her during the war and  the Depression. She was very popular with some people, but she was  also very unpopular. She was very hard-nosed and she wanted to do  things her way and she was very much for the New Deal. Roosevelt  himself, when war came along, he made compromises. He had to turn  back a little bit to the old capitalistic system in order to build these  camps and all that he had to do for the war. But I also saw Mrs.  Roosevelt over the years when she ended up a great, great statesman.  And she was a wonderful person, but that was later in her life, in my  view. Oh, Roosevelt was   just like they do now about Obama, you had  people like Westbrook Pegler that detested him. They thought it was the  16  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  end of the world. And you had people that adored him. Go back in the  greatest generation, some of those kids, and find out how many of them  are named Roosevelt.  How was life after the Depression?  Well, after the Depression I guess it would be about the time I was at the  Oklahoma Military Academy finishing up high school. Things were  wonderful then. My folks had a little bit of carryover getting back in  financial shape, but then they built back up in real estate and ended up  not rich, but they ended up prosperous and very comfortable in their  later years which I was glad to see. They were able to travel. And then I  went into the service in    44 and in    46 when I was being mustered out, I  entered West Point. Then while I was on graduation leave, South Korea  was overrun, so I got to see a little bit of World War II   not in combat,  but then I got to see combat in both Korea and Vietnam and then I  retired. When I retired I came back to Stillwater because my wife had  gone to school here.  After the Depression, do you recall your parents talking much about it  through the years?  Oh, yes.  Still very much a part of them?  Well yes, and to them it was kind of a pride thing, they had survived it.  My dad made a trip to the Pacific Northwest one time and ran into a  family (looked them up) that we had seen have one of these auctions and  in their case, they had actually sold their farm   destitute. They headed  west and war came along and they worked in the war industries and built  up a dairy. And my dad came back from that and he was so proud of  these people because they had all gone out there and all worked and  survived and ended up very, very prosperous dairy farmers in  California   either California or Oregon. We had a hired hand too. The  hired hand got paid  25 a month for working six days a week. He got  paid  25 a month, was allowed to have his garden and have that little  house. But people stood in line to get that job.  That   s a pretty good deal.  Yeah, it   s interesting because what   s going on now, I just watch it and  pray that it works, but the handling of the Depression, it was just  different than what they   re doing now.  How so?  17  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Well now, to me, the stimulus is just a bunch of pork barrel. They   re just  spending money. The Roosevelt thing was jobs. Roosevelt looked at the  unemployed people and put them to work. And they weren   t all laborers.  They had people that did murals in courthouses. They had people that  took tax records in courthouses and put them on microfiche, they made  copies of them. They took wills that had been filed and typed copies of  them. They had actors that put on shows for people. They had all across  the board on industries   the Depression looked to people that were  unemployed.  What was the hardest part of the experience for you?  The hardest part of the experience for me was there were other kids that  had more spending money than I did. I knew that times were tough but it  never really bothered me. I had a paper route in Tulsa and sold Saturday  Evening Post. Everybody worked on the farm and then when we went  back, Tulsa was where I had the paper routes, sold Saturday Evening  Post and whatnot. I had a job for a while driving at a pony ring which is  now Utica Square shopping center. Kids would pay a nickel to ride a  Shetland pony around the ring. There were some kids that were too little  or too scared to ride the pony, so they had one pony cart and the kid  would ride in the cart and I got paid to drive the cart. Jobs for kids  though during the Depression were really scarce, you go to a movie for  example, and there   d be a 45 year old man with three kids who would be  the usher or the ticket taker. You didn   t have young kids in those jobs.  You had grown men that were trying to raise families. Now, if you go to  downtown Tulsa, you know the Coney Island place that   s still over  there?  Yes.  With a quarter, take a bus to town for a nickel. Eat a coney for a nickel.  Pay a dime to go to the Ritz Theater and pay a nickel to ride back home.  Or you could go to Dale   s Orange Juice and pay a nickel and you got a  big mug of orange juice and all the Mexican peanuts that you could eat.  Times have changed.  Times have changed.  What advice would you give to people today about the best way to make  it through hard times?  Well, I   ll tell you one thing that I   ve experienced. When you   re 83,  you   re wasting your breath if you try to give anybody advice, because  they   re not going to take it because everybody now knows everything.  18  Nykolaiszyn  Price  I   m a history buff and the best way to learn is to know what happened  before and pay attention to it because cycles tend to repeat themselves.  But giving advice that   s going to be taken, to me I have a coffee group  and I don   t even suggest things to them because they   re not going to pay  attention to me. They   re going to pay attention to the people that are  currently involved in things. But the advice I would give them is I still  have a bit of the Depression syndrome   I don   t waste anything. They   re  worried about the green and the environment. Well the best way to take  care of the environment is to do what we did during the Depression for  financial reasons   we saved bottles and turned them back in, we saved  cans and turned them back in. Milk jugs you turned back in. All of those  things could be done.  I think people should avoid wasteful spending. I think wasteful  spending, whether you   ve got the money or not, is kind of silly. I   m very  conservative on   well not really I guess, I   m conservative on wasting  money, but you know, if you could buy something that your family  could enjoy right now, go ahead and do it because life is short. But just  being careful. And a little bit of a religious thing to, I think people need  to thank the good Lord for their life and they should realize that they   ve  got an obligation to do certain things to take care of other people and to  help them. I   ll give advice when it   s clearly asked for, but I don   t  volunteer it.  How do you feel that now people are making so many comparisons with  the state of our economy today and the Great Depression?  That does bother me in that if you didn   t live during the Depression,  they don   t understand. How can you feel bad when they   re building  buildings all over the campus? When they   re building a hundred and  some million dollar stadium? And I know that part of this athletic thing  has been delayed, but to me, this isn   t Depression. They talk about the  economy. I guess it   s really bad if you live in Michigan or somewhere.  We   re always delayed in Oklahoma. Always a little bit of delay getting  to us. But the comparison is just not there. They   re two different  situations. One thing, some laws have changed. We had people during  the Depression that died and there was no money. Their life insurance  policy was no good because the money hadn   t been set aside. That   s  been corrected. You had people that had bought stock and the stock had  gone to zero or low and now they still owed for it, but the stock was  worthless. That can happen only up to a certain extent. Now there   s been  a lot of protective laws that have been written. But the comparison,  what   s going on now   I just kind of sit back and wonder. I was reading  my paper over there   I read a lot and I figure that they   ll work it out.  But anything else that you want to hear? This is very enjoyable. I   ve  enjoyed this.  19  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  Nykolaiszyn  Price  I   ve enjoyed it, too. Are there any other stories that you   d like to share  about your time in the 1930s?  The 1930s, oh golly. I know that when I was in Tulsa we used to go  down on Midland Valley tracks and we would catch little ring neck  snakes. When we went up to the farm, we went up to this hill behind us,  my brother and I were looking for snake nests. We caught a whole  bunch of snakes   little snakes. Took them down to the hired hand, he  looked at them and said,    My god, those are copperheads     Snakes to us  were the little ring necks that we caught down on Midland Valley tracks  and so he dumped them out and stepped on and squished them all. But  we picked up that and all kinds of things that were on the farm. Learning  to milk a cow, riding a horse bareback. We had all kinds of experiences  on the farm and it turned out I   m really glad, a lot of my life and a lot of  my philosophy goes back to the years on the farm.  Well it seems like it was a tough transition, but a great experience.  Yeah. It wasn   t a tough transition for me because I was a kid. To a kid,  every day is a new day. But for my folks, I   m sure it was a horrible  transition. But I   ve always kidded that my Mother had an awful lot of  Scarlett O   Hara in her because she could be the belle of the ball and two  hours before that, as I said, she could be paperhanging a house.  An amazing work ethic.  Yeah, my brother wanted to put a tool box on her gravestone. We never  did that. And she had one guy, Ben   a black man, great guy. Ben could  do anything. He would go with her and she would take him out to these  various places. In our house in Tulsa, I take people to show them this  every once in awhile when I   m over there. We don   t own it anymore, it   s  long gone, but she needed to have a gas line that was going to go so you  would need two turns. Instead of doing that, Ben took this gas line and  bent it and then he bent it back the other way. So you go down in our  basement and there   s that gas line and it violates every kind of code  because a galvanized pipe can crack. But it   s been there 50 years I guess  and it hasn   t cracked yet. But if anybody every inspected that they   d say,     What in the world is that? Where   d they get that pipe made?    Well Ben  bent it. (Laughter) But he could do anything, he could do plumbing,  carpenter work, lawns.  Good memories. Well is there anything else you   d like to add?  I can   t think of anything. The only thing I would say is I would think we  would have learned from that experience and the politics was a lot  different in the thirties. You had the parties and they were very strong  20  Nykolaiszyn  Price  parties, but people were also very close. My dad got along with  everybody from the other party and during those years, we were getting  the Grand River Dam, all these dams were being built in Oklahoma too,  so that hired some people. But the politicians, they weren   t as vicious as  they are now. And they didn   t make the kind of money they make now.  They were closer to the people and they didn   t have this selfishness that  our politicians have now. And there was certainly not the animosity  between parties. I   m a registered Independent, I couldn   t be in any party  now.  Well thank you for taking time out of your day to share your stories, Mr.  Price. We appreciate it so much.  Thank you very much.  -------  -------
