Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Sir, could you please state your name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: David Russell Duerson.  Duerson is D-U-E-R-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: All right, and what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: November 28th, 1960, Muncie, Indiana.
Speaker 1: And, sir, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I am currently president and CEO [chief executive officer] and majority partner in Duerson Foods, LLC [limited liability company], which is a sausage and ground meat manufacturer.  And we have forty percent of the Burger King [Corporation] system around the world, do Hyatt's [hotel chain] business, Olive Garden [restaurant chain] and school systems, prison systems and the military and throughout the European theater.
Speaker 1: All right, and, but you're too modest to say so, you're a retired National Football League player, right?
Speaker 2: Played eleven years in the National Football League, seven years in Chicago [Illinois] with the Bears [football team], drafted in 1983, third-round pick out of [University of] Notre Dame [South Bend, Indiana].  I was actually projected to go in the first round, but I talked about law school too much (laughs), and back in, in '83 [1983], ESPN [sports network] had just started doing the, the [NFL] draft live.  And it was the second year, in fact, that ESPN had done the draft.  And I was in New York [New York], and with, with ESPN.  And every year, there's always one kid who's supposed to go early in the draft and ends up being there 'til the third, fourth, fifth round.  And in 1983, I was that guy.  And the draft started at 8 [A.M.] o'clock, on that particular morning.  And I said, "Please, God, take me anywhere but Chicago or Detroit [Lions, football team]."  And as it turns out, it just shows the Lord has a sense of humor.  On the third round, eighth pick, I got drafted by the Bears, was fortunate enough to have played on the World Championship team, Super Bowl XX [20] in Chicago.  In 1990, I was released by the Bears after my fourth All-Pro year.  Went to the New York Giants [football team], devastated, you know, by the release--went to the Giants, six months later, won another World Championship [Super Bowl XXI--21--in 1986].  And then I finished my career with three years in Phoenix [Arizona Cardinals, football team].  So eleven years in the National Football League.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is August the 28th, 2003.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are in Chicago, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Okay, in the offices of the HistoryMakers.
Speaker 2: In the offices of the HistoryMakers.

Speaker 1: What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Well, favorite food would be catfish, but I, I pause because raw oysters is very close.  But here lately, I, I've got a great affinity for catfish.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color is red, with a close--with black being very close.
Speaker 1: I would have guessed that (laughs).  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Fall.  And the reason behind that is from the time I was in the seventh grade until I retired from the National Football League, fall for me was football.  So I was either complaining that it was too hot, it was too cold, it was too rainy.  But I never got to enjoy the colors in the season.  And so upon retiring from the National Football League, the very first thing I was asked is, "What are you looking forward to?"  And I said, "Autumn, just the opportunity to see and appreciate the colors."  And so, fall, without question is my favorite time of year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Yes, favorite vacation destination would be South Florida.  We actually have a condo in North Miami Beach, but I just simply love south Florida.  And for my wife [Alicia Cooper Duerson] and I, our favorite destination would be the big island of Hawaii.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last question is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Well, my personal motto is my corporate motto and mission statement is "Never be satisfied."  Success ends where satisfaction begins.  So never be satisfied.
Story_ID: 6648
Speaker 1: I'd like to ask you about your family history now.  And I'm gonna start with your--I'm gonna ask about your mother's side and your father's side.  I'm gonna start with your mother's side of the family.  Can you give us her full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Mother's name is Julia Mae Leavell Duerson, J-U-L-I-A, M-A-E, Leavell is L-E-A-V-E-L-L, and Duerson, D-U-E-R-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her place of birth and date of birth?
Speaker 2: Mom was born outside of Paint Lick, Kentucky in 1921.  And she is--she'll be eighty-two years old this year, December 26th.  And she's in, in fairly excellent health.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what do you know about her side of the family?  How far back can they be traced, can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Well, on, on her side, we go back to Efraim (ph.) Leavell, which dates back to, I believe it's in the, it's the late 1700s so it'd be in the 1790s.  But for me though, you know, information gets a little slim.  So--but her father, Jesse L. Leavell, was one of the very first black ministers to, to bring a church to Muncie, Indiana.  They moved from Kentucky when my mom was two years old to Muncie, Indiana.  So she has virtually no memory whatsoever of her first two years in, in Kentucky--was brought to, to Muncie, and there he established Antioch Baptist Church, which today is a, a thriving church in, in the community of Muncie, Indiana.
Speaker 1: Okay, are there any stories about that earlier part of the history of your family, the Leavells in the 1790s or any stories about them?
Speaker 2: That they were a very strong and, and certainly a very religious family.  I come from a very long line of, of Baptist preachers.  And, in particular, on the, on the Leavell side.  As I said, my grandfather, when--he passed away in 1953 so I didn't have the opportunity to meet him.  But he was a pretty, he was a very dynamic man.  And my understanding is that his brothers and sisters all--the entire family, they were community oriented.  And I guess you would, you would say community activists back at that time as well, always looking for the greater good.  They--during the Depression, helped to feed a number of families.  My grandfather loved to grow his own vegetables.  So across Muncie, he had various fields where he grew different vegetables, whether they were tomatoes or cucumbers or greens or what have you, string beans and what have you.  And they fed several families in the Muncie area.  And, and he was, not necessarily single-handedly responsible, but certainly one of those very responsible for the survival of African Americans during that time in Muncie, and, you know, of course, during the Depression when food was very scarce.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you come from a family of activists sort of and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, activists and, and athletes.  The Leavell's are, are incredible athletes.  And my grandfather was 6' 5", about 270 pounds.  And so when you're talking about a man who was born in, in the late 1890s at 6' 5" and well over 260, 270 pounds, that was a big man back in those days.  And all of my uncles would have--in fact, every cousin I have, every male cousin I have on the Leavell side, there's only one male child under six foot.  But an extremely athletic family, and to this day, you know, certainly strong academically, but athletic builds.  You can pretty much identify a Leavell in Muncie, Indiana.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Anything about the Leavell's in Muncie?
Speaker 2: You know, as, as I said, very strong within the community, certainly in terms of religious background.  One of my aunts, my, my Mom's younger sister, Mary Leavell Moore, is a professional gospel singer and has a tremendous voice.  One of my first cousins, Allen Leavell, was a point guard for the Houston [Texas] Rockets [basketball team] for ten years, played on their Western Championship team with Moses Malone and Calvin Murphy, all those great guys--a number of athletes.  And, in fact--including my brother, several of my cousins went to, to college on basketball scholarships and then, you know, were able to go ahead and, and pursue their life's dream.  But my cousin, Allen Leavell, was the first one to make it into the pros and then me second in football.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember Allen Leavell.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, he--.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was a guard.
Speaker 2: --great talent, great talent.  So, you know, an extremely athletic family, an extremely religious family and large.  And, you know, we have annual family reunions on the Leavell side and on the Faulkner side, which is my, my grandmother [Mary Faulkner Leavell], my mom's mother.  And so thing's for certain, when we get together, we can fill up a church--we can have church all by ourselves.
Story_ID: 6649
Speaker 1: Give me your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My dad's name is Arthur Duerson, Jr., A-R-T-H-U-R--no middle, no middle initial or middle name.  My dad was born in Kirksville, Kentucky, and again, just outside of Paint Lick--raised in Richmond, Kentucky, which is the county seat of Madison County, Kentucky, and came to Muncie, Indiana immediately after World War II.  And my father fought in World War II in the [U.S. Army] Signal Corps, 448, which was part of the Third Army, fighting directly under, under [General George S.] Patton.  Dad fought in the European theater, was involved in most of the major conflicts there--Battle of Normandy, 'D-Day', and decorated twice with the Bronze Star.  And my father's eighty years old, he's in incredible health--great health, and he's my hero.
Speaker 1: What do you know about his side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Well, on the, on the Duerson side, we can go back to 1743.  And there we go back to Harry Totten, who was sold to the Duersons--to Robert Duerson, when he was three years old, and the name, and his name, of course, was changed to Harry Duerson.  And he was an extremely tough man and, but, but highly respected though by his, by his slave master, Robert Duerson.  In fact, from everything that we've, that we've been told, one thing that was for certain, you did not raise a whip to Harry Duerson, nor to any of his kids.  So if his kids needed to be disciplined, the slave master would tell Harry that his kids needed to be disciplined.  He was a very, very tough man, but he, he did his job.  He, you know, understood the times in which he lived.  But one thing is for certain, he was a man and he was not gonna be--and he was not gonna allow anyone to treat him like an animal.  And, and I guess I have to thank Robert Duerson for purchasing my great-great-grandfather.  Otherwise, my last name would be Totten, and I would have taken a lot of, lot of ribbing from that in the National Football League.  So, the Duersons are a very, very proud family, and within the family of children that, that Harry raised, one was Wyatt.  And she was married to the Kennedy family--that being, 'Uncle Tom's Cabin,' [by Harriet Beecher Stowe] General Tom Kennedy of, of 'Uncle Tom's Cabin.'  And so, so it was (unclear)--,
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: --and the Duerson goes way back.  And--,
Speaker 1: Okay, I just wanted to be clear.  Now, this is the Kennedy's in the book 'Uncle Tom's Cabin?'
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. He, he's, Tom Kennedy.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, Tom Kennedy, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, that's--is who Uncle Tom is in 'Uncle Tom's Cabin.'
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, General Tom Kennedy.
Speaker 1: All right, so Tom in 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' is Tom Kennedy, that--okay, I, I haven't read that part of the book, and I've read it in bits and pieces, but--,
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 1: --just for those who are, you know, may not have read it and stuff.  Okay, those are, those fictional characters though in the book, but--,
Speaker 2: Several of them are.
Speaker 1: But they're based on history and real life--,
Speaker 2: Based on real life individuals, General Tom Kennedy.
Speaker 1: It's a mix of different people that Harriet Beecher Stowe based the characters of the book on.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Uncle Tom--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) 'Cause I understand that the reason he was--a more fictional-type characters is because, because names--no one was actually certain of who the, the individuals really were because the names changed as they got, you know, bought and sold, et cetera.
Speaker 1: So some, I mean, was it, Josiah Henson was the prototype for Uncle Tom, and he's, he's--he eventually moved to Canada, but he, you know, he was--that was--okay, so it's Kennedy in the book?
Speaker 2: Yeah, General Tom Kennedy.
Speaker 1: In real life, was the name Kennedy?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: It was, okay.  So it was based on them, okay, the real life Kennedy's, okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: But the Duersons are a, likewise, a very strong, strongly religious family, and a very--and extremely close to the Leavell family.  But, but extremely proud.  And the focus, in fact, with my, my dad [Arthur Duerson Jr.], which he was, he has six siblings.  He is, in fact, junior.  My grandfather, Grandpa [Arthur] Duerson [Sr.], was--only had an eighth-grade education.  And so with seven children, raised in, in the early years in Paint Lick, Kentucky and then moving into Richmond, my grandfather was, was approached though, but an extremely wise man--was approached by the, the white leaders in Madison County, and they said, now, "Arthur, although the black kids have to go, you know, the segregated school, we will allow your kids to go to school with our children."  And my grandfather simply--being wise enough to, to recognize the times, said, "Well, you know, as much as I appreciate the opportunity, if, if everyone cannot attend, then, then my children will stay where they are."  And, you know, that was extremely wise at that point.  Now, certainly, you know, it, it may have, in fact, provided somewhat of a, of an opportunity for, for my dad and, and my aunts and uncles, but they would have been ostracized by the entire black community.  And, and they would have had their, their challenges, likewise, within the white community.  So certainly, for that pocket, right there in Madison County, Kentucky, life would have been great.  But they would have suffered the consequences down the road.  Grand--Grandpa was wise enough to know that.  So he kept my dad and my aunts and uncles at the segregated black school.  They were tobacco farmers.  And so with the seven children, my dad and his brothers and sisters all vowed that, that they would work hard to send my youngest uncle, my--or the youngest brother, youngest child, my Uncle John Duerson, to college, which they did.  And then they all vowed that their children would at least graduate college.  And so, so every Duerson grandchild of, of Arthur Duerson, Sr. did in fact attend college.  And so, so we then, the grandchildren, have vowed that our kids will have to do better than us because that's, that's the expectation--onward and upward, but that we have a great support system.  We just had our forty-seventh annual family reunion, which we've adopted two other families.  So it's the Duerson-Bennett-Miller family reunion.  It was originally started in, in Detroit [Michigan], but we found our home in Mount Airy Park in Cincinnati [Ohio].  And we would--every year it's the fourth Sunday in July.  And you couldn't, you couldn't go and register or reserve, you know, a particular park or what have you--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Picnic (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: Right.  So you'd have to get there early.  So we'd have a family member who would get there like 3:00 o'clock in the morning and stake out the very same place.  So for the better part of some thirty or thirty-five years, it was always in the exact same place in Mount Airy Park.  And then, of course, the family started to expand and with opportunity, family members started moving around.  Aside from being in Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, you know, we, our wings had begun to, to spread across the country.  So the family reunion started to move as well.  But this year, in fact, we were back in Richmond, Kentucky, at our roots and just--we have a family scholarship.  So every year any child that graduates high school, we provide funds for them to go on and further their education.  So it's a, an extremely proud family, where education is important, God is at the head, and it's a family built on, on taking care of its fellow man.
Story_ID: 6650
Speaker 1: Do you know what happened after the [U.S.] Civil War in terms of your family?  How, if they got--if your ancestors received any land after the Civil War or what they had to do to acquire, you know, status (unclear)?
Speaker 2: You know, I, I don't know, in fact, you know, whether they ever got the forty acres and the mule or what have you.  But I can tell you that, that my Dad [Arthur Duerson, Jr.], in essence, grew up middle class.  You know, they, they, they were tobacco farmers.  And they had large plots of land.  Harry worked and was able to, in fact, buy his freedom.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the former Harry Totten became Harry Duerson--,
Speaker 2: Harry, yeah, the former Harry Totten became Harry Duerson, passed away as a free man.
Speaker 1: So he was a free man of color in Kentucky in the 1800s?
Speaker 2: That's correct, that's correct.  Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So they gave him a head start?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Beyond that, they were tobacco farmers and, and carpenters.  And one of my great-uncles built the very first wooden spiral staircase in Madison County, Kentucky, that being Oscar Duerson and--my grandfather's brother.  So, again, a very, very proud family, but I can't tell you for certain if they ever received anything, you know, in terms of reparations or what have you.  But always a very hard (unclear)--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Probably not, nobody did (laughs).
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I mean that's (unclear)--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) That's why it's an issue now.  No, nobody, hardly anyone.
Speaker 2: Not that, not that I--I've never heard of anyone (unclear)--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) A few received some land or were able to get some government grant land, but it's, you know, through the states that they were in, but--,
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --it's--there was no policy that, you know, really bore any fruit.
Story_ID: 6651
Speaker 1: You told me something about your father [Arthur Duerson, Jr.]--,
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --well you said, after the war [World War II], he moved to Muncie [Indiana].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: He was a hero during the war, and he moved to Muncie.
Speaker 2: Right, he, dad was decorated twice, and came--in the [U.S. Army] Signal Corps--so he came to Muncie, Indiana and, you know, of course, wanted to get on with the telephone company because that's what they did.  They laid communications lines behind-- or wire behind enemy lines.  And, of course, this being in the '40s [1940s], they would not hire an African American to do that job.  So my dad was fortunate enough to find work within the, within the factory.  And at the same time was studying to be--become a mortician.  One of my mom's cousins, Ed Faulkner, Sr., and my dad were actually cousins on, on the other side.  And so they were in mortician school together.  And so--I call him 'Uncle Ed', and he had told my dad, he said, "Man, I've got one of my cousins you need to meet," actually, it was on, on the Leavell side, the Faulkner side, which was my mom's [Julia Mae Leavell Duerson] side.  And as it turned out, of course, it was, it was my mom.  And the one thing my mother told my dad is that, she would not, as they dated, that she would not marry a, a mortician.  She was not interested in hanging out with dead bodies the rest of her life.  And so dad gave up on mortician school and spent thirty-eight years with General Motors [Corporation].  And I can remember in eighth--I was going into eighth grade.  So this would have been 1973.  And all of a sudden our lives changed.  We went from being a one-car family to a two-car family.  And then the next year, my brother, Mike [Michael Duerson], who was going to high school, we became a three-car family.  And so I had asked my parents, "What changed?"  And my dad said, "Son, after some, some thirty years, General Motors finally gave me the job I was qualified to do when I came out of the war."  So, you know, some twenty-eight, twenty-nine years later, you know, from an economics perspective, he finally got the job that he was qualified to do on the day, from the day he came to Muncie, Indiana.  And so, you know, so our economics changed.
Speaker 1: Yeah, people were retiring from General Motors after thirty years.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I know that.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So they finally gave him the job he deserved after thirty years?
Speaker 2: Right.  So, and that was true for, for all of the guys, the men in Muncie.
Story_ID: 6652
Speaker 1: Muncie [Indiana] is model town America, and certainly was throughout the, the early to mid-19--1900s--automotive heaven.  And so all of your transmissions for automobiles were--the vast majority were built in Muncie.  And during wartime, within a matter of a week, all of the transmission factories in Muncie, could transfer and switch and make transmissions for tanks and military vehicles.  So Muncie was a very important city from the standpoint of, of our U.S. economy, and it was particularly true with us having a wartime economy here in the United States.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Muncie is characterized in the movie--,
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'Close Encounters.'
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'--,[directed by Steven Speilberg]
Speaker 1: Right, 'of the Third Kind.'
Speaker 2: --typical American town, middle American town.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and, and I guess that's still true today because, you know, you know, you start talking about the tracks and all that kind of stuff, and Muncie being in Indiana, in the East Central part of Indiana, you know, there are not--even today, a lot of African Americans who live on the opposite side of the tracks--and the economics does change.  And here we are in 2003, and there's a debate going on in Muncie right now to change the name of one of the streets, Broadway, which separates the black community from McCulloch Park, which in the '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s], early '60s [1960s], black folks couldn't even go across the street into the park.  The debate is to get the name of Broadway changed to [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] Boulevard.  And there is--the city has, has divided along racial lines.  And I've been reading about it up here in my 'Chicago Tribune' [newspaper], in fact, twice they were on the front page.  Once, dealing with the National Day of Prayer where the--this old minister said, you know, he was willing to invite other religious faiths, but they couldn't hold the mic [microphone], there would only be one prayer.  But they could come, but they wouldn't, they wouldn't hold the mic.  And then with this whole thing of, of naming the street after Dr. King.  And so, I finally got fed up, I wrote a scathing letter to the, to the editor of the local newspaper [the Star Press']--challenged him to write it, as--in verbatim, cause it was--we sent a copy to the, the black newspaper, 'The Muncie Times.'  They printed it--of course, it caused a major controversy in Muncie, but right now, the [U.S.] Department of Justice, from here in Chicago [Illinois] actually, Ms. Anita Cochran, has been down mediating.  And it looks like some good's gonna come out of this whole thing.  And so out of what could be Muncie's darkest moment, may, may actually become their brightest future.
Speaker 2: Now, that's a good thing.  It's funny, the name of this street is now Broadway, which--,
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --another name that is typical in every black community in the United States or a lot of black communities--,
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --as attested to by Dyke and the Blazers in their '60s [1960s] hit, 'Funky Broadway' (laughs)--,
Speaker 1: --"Every town I go to"--,
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --"has got a street."  Dayton's [Ohio] got one, Muncie's got one, a lot of these towns have Broadway.
Speaker 2: That's absolutely right.
Speaker 1: But, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and we actually, just a couple of weeks ago, had a, a city-wide reunion that takes place every four years in Muncie.  It's called 'Back to Muncie,' and it's, it's the African American community within Muncie.  So African Americans from all over the country who were born and raised in Muncie come back to Muncie for a four-day reunion.  And so I was back this year, and actually kicked it off that first evening on Friday, with the kids.  And then on that Saturday, there was actually a unity demonstration on Broadway--black, white, Asian, you name it--just a silent demonstration, standing there holding hands along Broadway--covered about three, three and a half miles.  And I was honored to stand next to my eighty year-old father for those three and a half hours.  And it was a very proud moment for me.
Story_ID: 6653
Speaker 1: Well tell me about your mother.  What is her name again?
Speaker 2: Julia Mae Leavell Duerson.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how did she grow up and what is she like?
Speaker 2: Well, mom's a preacher's kid.  And so she grew up, a typical preacher's kid, one of twelve children.  There were, she's in the, in the middle of the pack, and, except there was two or three that actually passed away when she was, who did not reach adulthood.  But mom is the, she's the matriarch of the family on the Leavell side.  And growing up, she and, and her sister, Ellen, were like inseparable.  And my Aunt Ellen was the director of the choir and played the piano and, you know, again, had one of those powerful singing voices.  My mom, too, was a director with a powerful voice.  But she was the cook, and, in fact, had her own catering business for sixty years.  In fact, only, only sold it some three, three or four years ago.  And she was a caterer, catered to the [Indiana] state General Assembly, to various large churches within Muncie and around the state of Indiana, did a lot of work in Indianapolis.  And she also directed weddings.  You know, so just a dynamite lady with incredible organization, an athlete, who in high school was a softball player, and ran track, you know, but just a, just a very special lady who embodied everything that is leadership.  And so, so growing up, you know, within the family, although born within the middle of the pack, she was, was seen as big sis, you know, because she just--wherever she was, she took a leadership position.  It was just--I guess it was innate.  And, you know, not that she would, would seek it out, but I guess water seeks its own level.
Story_ID: 6654
Speaker 1: Tell me about growing up.  What's your first childhood memory?
Speaker 2: It would be going down to Kentucky.  That's the very first that I, I remember as a child.  We would load up the car.  We had a sky blue Lincoln.  This is, you know, for me, my, my youngest memory is probably about three years old.  It was my grandparents' fiftieth wedding anniversary.  They were married, in fact, we share the same, the same date, November the 28th.  And so my third birthday.  And we were driving down to, to Richmond, Kentucky.  And I would--my seat was the arm rest in the back seat.  And I'm one of four children.  My parents have been married--it will be fifty-nine years this October 24th.
Speaker 1: Okay, what are your brothers and sisters names?
Speaker 2: My, my sister is Viola Duerson Boyd.  My brother Arthur, Arthur Duerson III, my brother, Mike, and myself.
Speaker 1: Okay, and are you--.
Speaker 2: And I'm the youngest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I would sit on the arm rest.  And that way I could, I could see down the road while my dad was driving.  And so my, my first vivid memory actually is, that, you know, we'd stop somewhere, you know, I'm three.  So we probably had to stop maybe five, six, seven times before we could get to Richmond because I'd have to use the restroom.  And so whether it was Indiana or in Ohio, because we would have to go U.S. Highway to get to Cincinnati, to where we'd pick up the Interstate.  And, you know, we'd stop at, at a gas station or something and, you know, dad, of course, would, would ask where's the restroom?  And then they'd say, "Well, for you, it's--it's out back.  You know, our restroom, would--you can't use our facilities," or whatever.  And I always remember that, that dad would march us in the back, you know, with shoulders up, just extremely proud.  And we'd be out there, and, of course, I describe it today as we were simply "pissing in the wind".  And so, you know, so I remember that simply because we always had to load the car up with food, you know, and, you know, with major food.  And Igloo was filled with water and all that kind of stuff.  And it wasn't until some years later in life that, that I actually figured it all out.  In fact, I was probably a freshman in college, when it just started to dawn on me, when we began to reflect a little bit on the childhood, that, you know, wow, you know, we were, we weren't able to use their restrooms simply because we were black (unclear) (simultaneously) reasons--
Speaker 1: Now, this is in--.
Speaker 2: And the reasons that we had to, to pile in all this food was because we couldn't just stop anywhere and, and go to a restaurant.  So the road stop, the rest stop on the side of the road was our restaurant.  And we used the picnic table, and then we'd empty out the, the trunk, you know, and eat, you know, our sandwiches or chicken and salads and whatever mom [Julia Mae Leavell Duerson] had prepared.  But that was back in the early '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then, is this mostly in Indiana and Kentucky or in Ohio too?
Speaker 2: Well, in Ohio too.  You know, but, but mostly in Indiana because I don't recall it being all that, all--us being that challenged early on, even in Kentucky.  And I think the reason behind that is that the Duerson name in Kentucky is highly respected and, and was from the days of my grandfather.  As I said, you know, dating back to, to Harry Duerson.  And, you know, as I'd shared earlier about this last family reunion which was back in Richmond, my dad, you know, is in extremely great health, but he had, he's a cancer survivor from prostate surgery.  So every now and then he'll have some little short-term memory loss.  And so he had forgot to actually pack his medicines.  And so my son, Tregg (ph.) and I, my number two son, we had actually flown into Cincinnati [Ohio] and drove down to Richmond.  And no sooner than we got there, we found out that dad needed to go to the pharmacy to pick up his medicines.  And so, you know, so we'd gone the route of, of calling back to Muncie [Indiana], speaking with his, his doctors, physicians, who had phoned in his, his medicines to a pharmacy.  Well, we get to the pharmacy and the pharmacists was just in awe that he was meeting Arthur Duerson, my dad.  And, you know, cause, you know, my son's thinking, oh, he's in awe cause my dad's got two Super Bowl rings and this whole thing.  It had nothing to do with Dave Duerson.  It was Art Duerson.  And this pharmacist had met my father some forty-seven years before.  And he knew everything about the Duersons and the whole thing, and he was, he was just so honored to meet my dad.  And so dad was picking up like five different medicines.  And the pharmacist would not allow him to pay for anything.  He had four of the medicines.  The one he did not have, he called another pharmacist, worked out a barter trade where he gave me a, a bag of some, some other pills that I took to this pharmacist.  And he traded them out and gave dad the, the medicines he needed.  No cost, no charge simply because he was honored to, to meet my father after some forty-seven years.  And, but this, this pharmacist kept us captivated for about an hour sharing Duerson stories.  And I just kept watching my son's chest swell.  And I told him, I said, "You know, son, it just goes to show you, you know, everything that I continue to talk about that, all a man has is his name and, and that comes from his integrity."  But it just goes to show that, although dad's been gone from Richmond for the better part of, of fifty years, some sixty years, he is revered in Madison County and throughout the state of Kentucky.

Speaker 1: Tell me about growing up in Muncie [Indiana].  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up in Muncie?
Speaker 2: Well, Muncie was, you know, that's basketball heaven.  So, you know, some people think of cornfields and that whole thing, but, but Muncie is, is the center of the universe when it comes to high school basketball, Hoosier hysteria.  And Muncie Central [high school] in particular, which now has eight state championships, more than any other school in the state of, of Indiana.  And Muncie is the seat of basketball as far, as far as we're concerned.  So very first memories are, are of sitting there in the, in the arena and, and smell the popcorn and the roar of the crowd.  And right now, throughout the state of Indiana, and that's particularly true in Muncie, guys are sitting around in restaurants talking about a free throw they shot back in 1929 that, that won them the sectional that, that went on to the regional's and, and that kind of thing.  That's life in Muncie, even today.  And when, when a male child is born in Muncie, Indiana, there's a NERF basketball that's gonna be in his crib long before the bottle.  And if he ever gets a pacifier, it's gonna be a basketball.
Speaker 1: You know, this is--okay, this is 'Hoosiers' [motion picture] all the way.
Speaker 2: The Hoosiers.  And then, then I come along, you know, and I play football.  And so, you know, it's that--you know, that's an oddity in and of itself from Muncie, Indiana, but that would be my first memory.  Then it would be when, when Tuhey Pool was, was opened to allow blacks to be able to swim there.  And there was a man by the name of Roy C. Buley (ph.), which, there's, in, in my neighborhood, which is called Whitely, the Buley Center--the Roy C. Buley Center.  And he was an activist back in the '50s [1950s] and, and '60s [1960s] in Muncie, and extremely strong.  And, and he pushed and pushed until the, the public swimming pool in Muncie would allow African Americans, would allow blacks to, to use the facilities.  And so I remember that because my parents were adamant that my brother and I would, would learn how to swim.  And I think I was some three years old when I took my first swim lessons in, in Tuhey Pool.  And, and I can remember the stairs and what have you.  There weren't a number of black families who were actually going over to use the facilities.  But my mom and dad made certain that, that, given that opportunity, we were gonna be one of the first in that pool.
Story_ID: 6656
Speaker 1: What else, I mean, about your neighborhood?  I mean--
Speaker 2: That it was a village.  The Whitely community [in Muncie, Indiana] was just that.  If you did anything wrong, the phone would ring and Art and Julia Duerson knew long before you got home.  And I might get, I could get three spankings on the way home.  And I was, I was very good at throwing rocks.  A good friend of mine and I, Troy Bridges--Troy got drafted by the Atlanta Braves [baseball team] out of high school.  And I was actually drafted by the [Los Angeles] Dodgers [baseball team].  And we could, we could throw rocks, what was two Muncie city blocks, which was a pretty good distance.  And we had guys who would spot for us, and, you know, that we lived near the outskirts of town.  And so we only hit brand new cars and classics.  And so we had these spotters.  And so they would let us know when a, when a great car was coming.  And then Troy and I would get out and run around and kind of like throwing a javelin, and we'd just, just launch the rocks.  And then we'd just wait and listen.  And, you know, and then, of course, the car or truck would slam on its brakes and the whole shot.  And they'd--of course, they were looking around.  There's nobody there, and here he's looking down the street, some two blocks, so obviously these kids didn't do it.  And, and we were the, we were the culprits.  And my very last spanking, I was thirteen years old, and my dad [Arthur Duerson] caught my arm in mid throw.  And that was a tough day.  Dad invited all my friends to the house.  They sat in the living room.  I was in the bedroom, but they could hear me (laughs), as he was putting that belt to my butt.
Speaker 1: He invited all your friends over to hear--to hear it--,
Speaker 2: Yeah, all my buddies.  See, we were all out there throwing rocks.  So, you know, so, so the message to them too was that, you know, this was ridiculous.  And my dad swears that I hit his truck.  He had a camper, and it was a hole in the, in the camper.  And I tried to convince him, dad, I didn't do it.  We didn't do it.  And he was like, "Ah, I know you did, I know you did."  And actually, it's only been in the last five years that he actually believes and understands now that I did not hit his truck because his truck was not new, and it was not a classic.  And so, you know, for, for a guy who's had a vehicle some eight, ten years or nine years and, you know, and, and it gets hit, no big deal cause it's not the first ding.  But on a brand new vehicle and on a classic, you know, that individual's gonna be adamant and emotional.  They're gonna slam on the brakes, you know, everybody jumped out of their vehicle.  And that's what we were looking was the, was that great reaction.  And so it's only been in the last five years or so that I think my dad now understands that I did not hit his vehicle, although I deserved the whupping.  There was no question about that.
Speaker 1: Well, when kids do those kind of things--we were talking to Lee Allen Jones, who was in the "Our America" program that broadcasts on television.  (Unclear) (simultaneously) And he was from the, over by Ida B. Wells [Homes, housing project, Chicago, Illinois].  And he and his buddy used to get on top of the bridge at Oakwood and the Lake [Michigan] and throw big rocks down on cars, on Lake Shore Drive, (unclear) (simultaneously), and he never thought--,
Speaker 2: Right, you know, (unclear) (simultaneously) they could have killed someone.
Speaker 1: --he never thought about that.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: But did you all, how did you all rationalize--I mean he, he told his friend once, and as he, and they taped it for public radio.  They were throwing the rocks and they were taping themselves.  And his friend said, "Ah, you busted that woman's windshield".  He said, "Ah, they got insurance.  I ain't worried about them people."  (laughs)
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: But, well, did you ever think about the consequences in those days or?
Speaker 2: No, well, you know, throwing the rocks from two blocks away, you, you know, we're--you knew you weren't gonna get caught because, I mean, who in their right mind would think that some teenaged kids, you know, some adolescent-aged kids, twelve or thirteen years old, could throw rocks that far.  You know, I was only four foot ten [inches] and weighed about eighty three pounds.  And so it was just no way in the world you're gonna believe that, that some little guys like that, and furthermore, and you're looking way down the street, you know they didn't launch them.  So it must have been somebody closer.  And so we never worried about getting caught--
Speaker 1: And also--(unclear) (simultaneously)--
Speaker 2: --but the one thing, the one thing I, I failed to do was to look behind me.  And my dad caught me in, in mid throw.  And so to this very day, if I see rocks, I kick 'em, I kick them out of the way.  I never will pick them up and toss them to the side of the street.
Speaker 1: It's a strange phenomenon.  I guess it proves on some level that kids' brains aren't fully developed (laughs).
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Cause they do these things, they're not necessarily bad kids.  They just do them, you know.
Speaker 2: And, you know, it was, it was fun, you know.  And so, you're right.  I mean, you know, we did not think in terms of actually, you know, severely damaging someone's property or what have you.  Of course, there were times when we threw apples from close range.  And it was right after I got, I got that final spanking when I was thirteen that I thought, you know, as hard as I throw--because, you know, again, Trey Bridges and I were, we were pitchers and outfielders and, and we threw extremely hard.  In fact, when I got to the [Chicago] Bears [football team], the '[Chicago] Sun-Times' [newspaper] would do these profiles on professional athletes.  They would ask you, what's your favorite movie; your favorite food and all your very favorite things.  And one of the questions that he asked me was, what is something that nobody else knows?  And my statement was that, that I was the second fastest pitcher in Chicago, next to Lee Smith.  So I, I can hurl pretty good.  And so it wasn't until I got that, that last spanking and actually thought about it, said, you know, particularly, when we were throwing from close range, if, if I threw and the window was open, because again, we only did this like in the summer and the fall.  And so there was a strong likelihood the window was open because air conditioning in vehicles was, you know, was not common place.  I could have taken a driver out and, and done severe damage.  And so it was--I'll never forget we [the Chicago Bears] had just won the Super Bowl here in Chicago [1986].  And my brother, Mike, and I are driving to Muncie.  And I'm driving a Corvette, a ZR-1, it's the fastest thing on the road.  It's classic, it's beautiful, it's gorgeous.  And we, we had just gotten into Muncie.  And so I picked up pizza, you know, cause Muncie's got this incredible pizza chain called Pizza King.  And so that's like when you go to Muncie, you got to get Pizza King.  So that's the first thing we did.  And no sooner than, than we grabbed our pizza, and we were driving down Walnut Street, I mean we weren't back in the car thirty seconds, and a kid threw a major brick into my windshield on my brother's side.  And, you know, and fortunately, it, it didn't come all way through.  But, of course, I slammed on my brakes, and I just dropped my head.  And I said, "touché".  And then, I just drove, drove on and went straight to my parents' house.  You know, no more emotion than that.  It was like coming full circle, and it--what a, what a rude awakening.  And about every time I go home, and I drive a car, something happens.  Someone'll, you know, bump my car or something, something always happens.  But in this particular instance, when that rock went through my windshield, it was, it was a comical moment for me.  You know, it was--all those people I hit got payback in one moment.  It cost me twelve hundred bucks.
Story_ID: 6657
Speaker 1: Tell me about school, now.  Well, well not necessarily school yet cause you're, not only throwing rocks [a favorite childhood game], you played baseball you said.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you play football when you were little?
Speaker 2: Played football, basketball and baseball.
Speaker 1: Did they have a Little League football situation?
Speaker 2: We, we, we had flag football, but, but we played in the street.  We, we had--we played touch football.  And it was a neighborhood kind of thing.  So we would--I was born and raised at 1807 East Hines Street [Muncie, Indiana]--and we were the Hines Street Tigers.  And so then the street behind us was Butler.  They were the Butler, Butler Street Bulldogs.  And, you know, there were the Kirk Street Cougars.  So, you know, all up and down our neighborhood, whatever street you lived on, you know, you had your touch football team.  And, you know, whether, whether we were playing three or four-man ball or, you know, eight and nine-man touch football, there were the street teams.  And the Hines Street Tigers, we were, we were pretty awesome.  And, my brother and I--I didn't know until several years later that, that we had the rivalry thing going on between us.  My brother is, he's six [feet], six [inches].  I'm six [feet], two [inches]  but, you know, so, of course, he always towered over me.  And I was really short as a child.  And, in fact, my parents had, at one point, had my pelvis x-rayed because, because they thought I was gonna be a runt, you know, like, not necessarily a midget, but, you know, a little bit larger, but, but a runt.  And we just did the same thing with my youngest son, Brock, who's fourteen.  And he's like five, two (5'2"), about a hundred and five pounds.  And he's a freshman in high school.  And so, you know, of course, what the doctors have said is simply that, he's one year, physically, behind his peers, but that, you know, but that he'll, he will be fine.  And I'm fairly certain because I looked just like Brock at that age.  And so, but anyway, there's this--there was this rivalry going on between my brother and I that I wasn't aware of because when I was five, six, seven years old, with the Hines Street Tigers, I'd be a first-round draft pick by the big guys when they were selecting, you know--when we played pick-up games amongst ourselves, I'd be one of the first picks.  And I'd get picked before my brother who was two years older and a whole lot taller.  And so that was pretty much the way it was for us.  Playing baseball, little league, I was the batboy.  And my brother was a pitcher, and, you know, I'm like seven years old.  And on our, for our little league baseball team, I was the batboy, I believe I was seven.  And Mike was pitching and he was playing first base.  And so I would run and go pick up the balls and the bats and get everything together.  And so the coach had asked me to, you know, I'd picked up a ball and asked me to throw it into the catcher, you know, just because they were just trying to hit some more balls to the outfield.  And I fired it in.  And it, and it came down low and into the strike zone.  And so the, so the coach said, wow, throw him another ball.  So he threw me another one, and so I threw it back, and the catcher had to bend down again, and, you know, it was down in the strike zone.  So, so they took away my, my 'BB' uniform which meant batboy and gave me a uniform.  That's one of the, one of the, one of the pictures that, that you guys have.  And you'll see that I'm extremely small, yet I was starting on the baseball team.  And they put first at third base, and eventually, over to first base and before the season was over, I was in the pitching rotation with brother, Mike.  So football, basketball and baseball.  Baseball-basketball for me was the sport that kept me in shape between football season and baseball season.  Yet, I was a starting point guard for our varsity team for three years, of which my sophomore year, we were the number eight ranked team in the nation.  And, you know, and all the guys, including my brother, went to school with basketball scholarship.  But basketball for me was just a sport to keep me in shape between football and baseball.  Baseball is actually, even today, my first love.  I love watching both the [Chicago] Cubs and the [Chicago White] Sox, and, and will always be a [Los Angeles] Dodgers fan.
Speaker 1: Okay, is that because of Jackie Robinson [baseball player], the old Jackie Robinson (unclear) (simultaneously)--
Speaker 2: No, because they offered me a contract (laughs).
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: When I came out of high school.
Speaker 1: Now, the older brothers--
Speaker 2: Yeah, because of Jackie Robinson, sure.  No, actually, because they, they were prepared to change my life at eighteen.  But when my Dad asked them, "What about college?"  They said there was no time for college.  And so my Dad said, "Thanks very much".  And that was a very short conversation.  And, of course, I went on to, to play at Notre Dame [University, South Bend, Indiana],
Story_ID: 6658
Speaker 1: Went to elementary school at Longfellow, East Longfellow Elementary School [Muncie, Indiana] in our neighborhood and was, was a very good student.  And, in fact, going into fourth grade, I was placed in, in a gifted student program, where at that time, we went to school, the gifted students on, they had an extra day on Saturday.  It was called Saturday school.  But, but what happened on that, on that Saturday is that we would be introduced to museums and, you know, we might take a trip to Indianapolis [Indiana] to the state Assembly.  You'd meet with the governor and politicians, what have you.  In other words, we were being introduced, you know, our environment was being expanded.
Speaker 2: So this is, is this an integrated situation in (unclear) school?
Speaker 1: Yes, it was.  Yes, it was.  It was, it was integrated elementary school.  Those, because there were several white families, you know, in the area in which we--which we lived.  They were basically on the outskirts of, of Muncie.  But, you know, and not so there--in other words, you're talking about low to--low income to, to low-middle income families.  And so, so, yeah, even in elementary school, I went to, went to school in an integrated environment.  But then I was bussed across town to Storer Middle School [now an elementary school], which is where the affluent white kids were, and so we were--the black kids were ten percent of the school population.  And most of the kids I grew up with actually went to a rival middle school, McKinley.  So, in other words, you know, all the kids that I grew up with, right there in my neighborhood, our alley happened to be the dividing line.  And so those who were North of, of our alley, went to, were bussed to Storer.  And the other kids South of, of our alley went to McKinley.  So we were only ten percent of the school population at Storer.  And so, and, and of the total group of kids that I grew up with, we were, we, we probably were only some five percent of the, of the African American students in our, in our neighborhood.  So, to Storer Middle School.  And then to Northside High School, which was a public college prep high school.  It was around for, about ten years and now is, is the middle school there in Muncie or one of the major middle schools.
Speaker 2: Now, how many high schools does, did Muncie have?
Speaker 1: Muncie had four, four high schools.  Muncie North, Muncie Central, of course, which is, which is the basketball capital of the world, Muncie South and Burris Laboratory School, which is attached to Ball State University.  And so all of the, the teachers and instructors at Burris were actually college professors.  So it was a Lab School. [Burris is part of the Teachers College of Ball State University, Muncie, Indiana.]
Story_ID: 6659
Speaker 1: Any teachers in grade school that stand out as important to your development or?
Speaker 2: Actually, several, several teachers, but the first one I remember was, was Mrs. Heights (ph.).  And she was my second grade teacher.  And she would make a statement to us every day, "Learn to listen, listen to learn."  And it didn't make a whole bunch of sense at the time, you know, to, to us it was just, it was just a mere statement, and kind of like a poem that, that we had to, to learn.  But somewhere going into middle school, it all hit home, that for the--because I couldn't understand why the bulk of, of the people that I grew up with, once we got over to, to Storer Middle School [Muncie, Indiana], who were A students at East Longfellow [Elementary School], our A's were C's compared to the kids at Storer.  And so, you know, so a lot of our, our study materials and what have you, the books and what have you, I guess were, either they were inferior or our instructors.  And I will not believe for a moment that our instructors were inferior.  But yet, when we got to Storer we were behind the curve.  And so in closing that gap, I just made certain that I paid real particular attention to what, what the teachers were saying and, and what we--and the way in which they taught.  And then, it was then that it hit home what Mrs. Heights had shared, "Learn to listen, Listen to learn."  Other than that, we had been--when I was in high school, 'Mad Dog' Warner, is what we called him.  And he was my Economics teacher.  And, of course, I went on to get an undergraduate degree in Econ.  He was just this wild, crazy kind of guy, you know, the kind of guy you see [feature film and TV show] 'Paper Chase', with the long hair and the, and the mustache and the beard and, you know, a 'Welcome Back Kotter' [TV situation comedy] kind of guy; you know, probably fashioned himself as somewhat of a comedian.  But that was the way in which he got you to focus.  And he got incredible--he could pull it out of you as a student.  And, you know, great respect, but, but more importantly, you know, he could pour it into you.  So everyone of us, as students, we were dry sponges, every time we would walk into his classroom.  So he's the, the second one that I remember.  But beyond that, my Aunt Doris Faulkner, who was the, over the music at [Muncie] Northside High School, she, in fact, brought the, the Christmas program to Muncie, whereby all of the, the elementary schools, the junior highs and high schools would come together in the basketball arena for a, a Christmas singing and celebration.  And we'll always remember her for what she did for us.
Story_ID: 6660
Speaker 1: Tell me about high school.  Now, you went to Northside?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I went to Northside High School [now middle school, Muncie, Indiana].  It was a public, college-prep high school that we were bussed to, again, about 10 percent of the student body.  But a great place.  You know, we competed everyday academically.  We had first-class facilities.  I was fortunate, you know, from an academic perspective, I was an all-honor student.  So there were a group of us, ten guys, and I was the only black guy in our, in our group.  We nicknamed ourselves the 'Outcasts', 'cause we couldn't fit in anywhere.  We were a bunch of academics who were also quite athletic.  And so we didn't fit in with any particular group, whether it was black or white, whatever, we didn't fit in because, you know, we were athletic nerds or, or nerds who could run, whatever.  And so we didn't fit in with, with the group of guys who were just straight academics.  And we didn't fit in with just the straight jocks.  So we created our own little group, and we called ourselves the Outcasts.
Speaker 1: And needless to say (unclear) (simultaneously)--
Speaker 2: Nobody wanted us.
Speaker 1: Needless to say, you didn't fit in with the guys that were doing the street stuff.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, I know you had some in Muncie [Indiana] too, just who were doing stuff (simultaneously)--
Speaker 2: Well, with that, there was no question about.  And I rode the bus one time, my very first day going to Northside.  And there were some, some kids on the bus who were smoking some herb [marijuana], and had fired up their, their joint.  And so my brother, Mike, would have been a junior in high school.  The very, the very next day, my dad [Arthur Duerson Jr.] gave us, what was then the family vehicle, which was a Delmont Oldsmobile--88 Oldsmobile, which we named Betsey, and that was our transportation going to school.  So, in other words, Mom [Julia Mae Duerson] and Dad, didn't want us anywhere near that drug scene.  And, and we, we certainly appreciated that because, you know, those were kids who were getting in, in a lot of trouble and causing a lot of trouble.  And, and our parents didn't want us around, around that kind of environment.  So, so we got a car.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, but the deal was, of course, we had to keep our grades up.  Otherwise, we had to be back on that bus.
Speaker 1: Now, did your brother play basketball too?
Speaker 2: Mike did, ran track and cross country, and, and played basketball and actually went to college on a, on a basketball scholarship to IUPUI, which is Indiana University, Purdue University in Indianapolis [Indiana].
Story_ID: 6661
Speaker 1: Well, what are the highlights of your high school career?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, aside from, from the things I did in the classroom, I was a musician, played all the brass instruments and was fortunate in my sophomore year of high to tour thirty-eight countries in an All-American band, The American Musical Ambassadors.  I played the, the trumpet, the baritone and the tuba.  And so I took sousaphone which is a large tuba, to Europe in this All-American band.  And I can still hear some of the waltzes in my ear, as I sit here chatting with you.  But like anything, if you don't use it, you lose it.  So my lips are getting numb just talking about it here because it's been some years since I've, I've played my instrument.  I still have a flugelhorn that I pull out every now and then at home, but I love jazz, love, love jazz.  And so, you know, music, because of my family, as I'd, I'd mentioned earlier, my mom [Julia Mae Duerson], you know, directed the choir and, you know, and had a strong, powerful voice.  My sister [Viola Duerson Boyd] was a, was actually studying to be concert pianist, then fell in love.  You know, my aunts and uncles and what have you, and so music has always been a, a major part of my life.  So touring Europe as a, as a fifteen year old changed my, my whole perspective on things.  And, you know, so I, I--I guess I had a very unique childhood in that I got exposed to a lot of things early on.  But, but my parents did an excellent job of that too.  Every summer that I can recall, we would spend two or three weeks somewhere, traveling, being exposed to, to something other than, than the environment in which I grew up.  So whether it was traveling to California, along the southern route or, or up towards the Grand Tetons of Yellowstone National Park [Wyoming] or, you know, to the, the Grand Canyon [Arizona], you know, traveling south, whatever, our parents exposed us every year to something, just broadening our, our minds.  And so, so Europe was, was an additional thought to that.  And I got a greater appreciation for all that my dad [Arthur Duerson Jr.] had, had gone through as well, you know, traveling into--because we were able to travel behind the [Iron] Curtain [Soviet Union and its allied countries], back in '76 [1976], and because music's the international language or one of the international languages.  And so I saw a lot of the devastation and, you know, left from World War II, where things just as they were, bombed out, whatever.  And I saw the devastation.  So I had a much greater appreciation for, for what my dad had lived through and was decorated for his service and for all he had to deal with, you know, in coming back here to the U.S.

Speaker 1: My other experiences at Muncie [Indiana], from an athletic perspective, I was fortunate enough to start varsity all four years in baseball as a pitcher and outfielder.  I started on our football team from my sophomore year, and we were undefeated.  Our freshman class, freshman team, we were undefeated.  And then I played junior varsity ball as a freshman.  So then when I became a sophomore, I was a starting quarterback and played safety on our varsity, but kind of like some of the running quarterbacks today, I actually, it's--I had more rushing, you know, yards and touchdowns than, than our two running backs.  So the following year our coach made me a running back.  And so then, I played running back and, and safety my last two years in high school, and was their starting point guard on the varsity for three years.  But was blessed during my football career in Indiana that I was a high school All-American.  I was a state most valuable player, was recruited by major colleges all over, all around the country and signed a four-year scholarship to play at [University of] Notre Dame [South Bend, Indiana].  But I'll never forget my recruiting experience because as we were, were going through that process, we had taken a visit down to Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana.  And my parents were with me.  It was my official visit.  And Lee Corso [Indiana University football coach] was just selling my parents on, on IU.  And that you, you know, this is as good as it gets. And, you know, I was interested in undergraduate studying business with a pre-law concentration because I'd--my dream was to go into Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] and eventually own my own manufacturing business because, you know, as a young kid, I would always go, you know, with my dad [Arthur Duerson Jr.] to, to Chevrolet to, to the General Motors [Corporation] plant where he worked.  And the sound of all those six hundred and nine hundred ton presses, stamping out all those transmission parts and what have you, was just like music to me.  And so from as far back as I can remember, I'd always wanted to own my own manufacturing business.  So, at any rate, you know, going through that recruiting process, we were down at IU.  And Lee Corso is selling my, my mom and dad on, on Indiana University.  And so my dad pulled me to the side and said, "Son, I don't think you're gonna be able to do better than IU."  And I told him, "Dad, just stick around, and you'll hear that same, same speech and story 250 times." And so sure enough, we did.  And so, as we were leaving IU that day, the governor then was Otis [R.] Bowen.  His limousine pulls up next to us.  He rolls down his window, and he says, "Dave, you owe to the state to stay in Indiana."  I said, "Governor, I'm staying in the state."  He said, "That's great."  I said, "I'm going to Notre Dame."  So he just rolled his window up and they just drove on.  So, but, that was my experience in high school.  My high school football coach, Terry Hitchcock, was a great influence on me, particularly, when you start talking about those defining moments in your life. I'll never forget, it was during two-a-days, my final summer as a high school football player my senior year.  Coach calls me into his office before practice and he simply sits me down for a moment and says, "Now, Dave, understand this.  Everybody in the state is watching you, but more so than everybody in the state and around the country, you've got forty-four other guys--," you know, we we're a very small football team.  He said, "But you've got forty four other guys watching you.  And if you dog it on one play, that gives everybody else a license to dog it."  And so, so my challenge was to make certain that I led by example everyday.  And that was, that was one of those messages I got loud and clear and received.  And, to this very day, I try to live by example more so than by word of mouth.
Story_ID: 6663
Speaker 1: Tell us about [the University of] Notre Dame. Now, this is legendary Notre Dame, got the golden dome and all that--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, all of that, Notre Dame was--.
Speaker 1: South Bend, Indiana.
Speaker 2: You know, I, I go back to 1972 or '73 [1973].  It was '73 [1973], and I was doing a book report on Rocky Bleier.  And Rocky Bleier, of course, you know, great--everyone knows him as being the great fullback for Franco Harris blocking with the, 'Steel Curtain' [1970s Pittsburgh Steelers football team's defense].  But Rocky Bleier to me was a running back who played at [University of] Notre Dame [South Bend, Indiana], got drafted into the Vietnam War and took some shrapnel from a land mine.  And the doctor told him he'd never walk again.  And he said, "Not only will I walk again, I'm gonna play in the National Football League."  And so the, the story of Rocky Bleier, a lot of it is centered around his time at Notre Dame.  And, you know, the book does not spend a lot of time with his Vietnam experience.  It talks about his strong will and desire, his push to get up off of that bed, not only to walk, but to run and to, to play at a professional level, and that he--it kept alluding back to his Notre Dame experience.  At that time, I didn't know that Notre Dame was in Indiana--it couldn't be because this basketball country.  And Notre Dame, the great college football team in the world had to be like on the West Coast or, or the East Coast up near, near Harvard [Cambridge, Massachusetts], near Boston [Massachusetts] somewhere.  But it couldn't be in Indiana.  And it just didn't make sense, and certainly not in northern Indiana.  So that same year 'Brian's Song' [motion picture] came out, the story of [the friendship between] Gayle Sayers and Brian Piccolo [Chicago Bears football teammates].  And so here I am, about 4 foot 8 [inches], seventy-five or so pounds, you know, because I remember the next year I was 4 foot 10 [inches] and weighed eighty-three pounds.  I told my parents, "I'm gonna play football.  And, and I'm gonna go to Notre Dame."  Now, baseball's still my first love, but, but at that point, I'm gonna go play football.  So I'm, I'm making my decision that I'm gonna, I'm gonna travel both paths, but, but I intend to play football.  And so I remember just like my dad [Arthur Duerson Jr.]  just grabbing me by the top of the head and saying, "Son, just keep the grades up, and we'll do whatever we can."  So in other words, you know, they, they too, they thought I was gonna be a little runt.  So forget the football playing.  It's a great dream to have, but keep pushing on the academic side, and we'll, we'll do whatever we have to, to ensure that you get there.  Well, God fulfilled my dream.  And I'm here to tell you, you can cut deals.  I was a sophomore in high school, and from the time I was a sophomore, I would end every prayer with, with "Lord, if you will let me play football at Notre Dame, I will do whatever it is you want me to do."  And so, sure enough, you know, the offer came, a full scholarship.  I was recruited by Dan Devine who was then the head football coach.  And something he had told that I, of course, I didn't remember at the, at the time I took my visit to South Bend, was he said, "Be ready."  And so on the day that I showed up on campus for two-a-days he called into his office right away. And he said, "Do you remember what I said?"  And, of course, you know, well, "No, coach, what?"  He said, "I told you to be ready."  And I said, "Oh, yeah, absolutely."  But, of course, you know, you figure that's something he tells every kid.  Well, long story short, going into my second game, as a freshman, I became a starter in our secondary and started off four years in my, my career at Notre Dame.  Returned punts, actually I led the nation as a freshman.  I had a 17.9-yard average.  But every year, it would get lower and lower, but I was fortunate enough to be All-American twice at Notre Dame.  I was captain under Gerry Faust and team's most valuable player.  So I got everything you could get out of the Notre Dame experience, from a football prospective.  On the academic side, I got my degree in economics, was an honor student in economics.  And so in my mind, I got the best of the Notre Dame experience, period.  A great spiritual environment, some wonderful friends.
Story_ID: 6664
Speaker 1: Today I find myself a trustee [of the University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana].  I'm the president of our National Monogram Club, which is any athlete who's ever received a varsity award.  I'm president for the next two years.  So it'd be from 2000--June of 2003 through June of '05 [2005].  And Notre Dame is a special place to me, and I'm honored to have been a major part of the selection committee that hired our current head football coach, Tyrone Willingham.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  Now, he's the first black head coach at Notre Dame?
Speaker 1: First, first African American head coach, period.  And Notre Dame being the center of universe for college football--I'll, I'll never forget the day.  It was December 30th, 2001.  And my parents were with my and I at our condo in North Miami Beach [Florida], and I'm on a conference call.  And we are--the Notre Dame Selection Committee, we'd just an issue where we had hired a football coach from Georgia Tech [Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia], George O'Leary, and he had lied on resume.  And I felt like I'd personally taken a shot in the gut because I'd asked him one question which was, "George, what's your biggest pet peeve?"  And he said, "Dave, I demand of my staff and my players and with my coaches", and he pointed, and he said, "Don't lie to me, don't you ever lie to me."  And I felt good about that because there was nothing about him that sold me that he was our coach.  He didn't have a commanding presence.  There was nothing that, you know, that, from academic perspective, in terms of the graduate, the number of kids he graduated from Georgia Tech that stood out.  So there was nothing that I could hang my hat on.  And so when I asked him what his pet peeve was, and he spoke about integrity, well, that's a Duerson, that's a Duersonism.  And so he sold me on that.  Two days later, we get a call that he had lied about his resume.  And, and he voluntarily resigned from the university.  So we were back at the hunt.  But I'll never forget that day because several of the people on that call were lining up, to hire Rick Neuheisel who was the head football coach at the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington].  And when they got around to me on the call, and asked me what did I think, my comment was, "I don't know what to think.  I'm, I'm, I'm disappointed and I'm embarrassed.  We have four main criteria.  And you guys and I know that on our A List we had Jon Gruden, Steve Mariucci, Mike Belotti from [University of] Oregon [Eugene, Oregon] and Tyrone Willingham.  And yet, we've gotten to List K through T and on every one of those lists, Ty's name is the last one mentioned.  And you guys know and I know that he is the best man for the job.  It has nothing to do with him being African American.  I understand.  But at the end of the day, he is the best man for the job.  This is a paradigm shift.  I understand.  But Tyrone Willingham is the best man for the job."  So then I simply said, "So for my benefit, don't mention Tyrone Willingham's name again."  And, so then the call started breaking, so obviously, I'd, you know, had shaken some people up.  But I did it because I couldn't simply, sit there on that call and agree to hire a guy who, one, that we knew had a lot of NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] issues for recruiting infractions.  I couldn't, I couldn't do it.  And the other thing was my, my wife and, and our kids, my mom [Julia Mae Duerson] and my mother-in-law were out shopping.  So the only two people at the condo were my dad [Arthur Duerson Jr.] and I.  And my father's my hero, and, you know, and I'm thinking about all my dad's gone through, you know, and the sacrifices he's made, you know, for, for myself and my, my two brothers and my sister, for my mom and just, you know, just how much I honor and love him.  And so I couldn't simply, stand on that call and simply say, "Oh, yeah, great, yeah, let's go with Rick Neuheisel."  I couldn't do it.  So I went on my little tirade for like about four minutes.  And so when I got off the call, I turned to my dad, and I said, "Dad, they're probably gonna ask me to step down from the board of trustees," because when I graduated from Notre Dame, immediately after graduation, I spoke, when I got drafted by the [Chicago] Bears [football team], I spoke out about Gerry Faust.  It was a four-page article in the ['Chicago] Sun-Times' [newspaper].  And so I was excommunicated from the university for four years until everything I said came to fruition. And--.
Speaker 2: What did you say about him actually?
Speaker 1: Well, at the end of the day, my major statement was simply that, "I feel sorry for the young men who will play four years under Gerry Faust because they will never know what it's like to truly play Notre Dame football."  And I had, I was fortunate to have played two years for Dan Devine.  And nothing anything Gerry Faust, but there were some things, the way in which he coached his team, it was--Gerry came to Notre Dame from Cincinnati [Archbishop] Moeller High School [Cincinnati, Ohio], the greatest high school football team in the country.  And he was the greatest high school football coach in the country.  But he was a man in over his head at the great college football program in the country.  And it took a while for it to manifest.  But my senior year, I was a captain, and I was a spokesman for the, the other two captains.  We were tri-captains.  And I'll never forget, one day, where I had the assistant coaches come to me and ask me to speak with, with Coach Faust to ask him to let them do their jobs.  And my first, my, my first and only call was to my dad, just to simply say, "Dad, I'm only twenty-one."  And my dad understood exactly what I was saying, that, here I've grown men coming to me, asking me to voice their concerns to the head football coach.  So at any rate, I was excommunicated.  Then everything I said came true.  So I was brought back as Notre Dame Man of the Year, and, you know, I was placed on the, on the College of Business Advisory Board, and today, I find myself a trustee.  And since that time too, I've received Notre Dame's very highest honor, which is the Edward Sorin Award, who was, was a founder of Notre Dame.  So at any rate when I said that to my dad, said, "Dad, they'll probably ask me to step down from the board of trustees."  He said, "Son, if what they want is a yes man, you should step down anyway."  Then he said, "But I believe they have you on that board because they needed a man with integrity and you will say exactly what's on your mind and what's in the best interest of Notre Dame."
Story_ID: 6665
Speaker 1: Before we leave [University of] Notre Dame [South Bend, Indiana], who were some of your teammates on that Notre Dame, those Notre Dame teams?
Speaker 2: Well, under [head coach] Dan Devine, it would have been Vegas Ferguson, who was a tailback, Rusty Lisch was our quarterback, Dave Waymer was a great defensive back.  He was actually my big brother.  Hardy Rand (ph.).  Then under [Notre Dame football coach] Gerry Faust, my teammates, Phil Carter, was our tailback, and actually still holds the record for the most rushing yards in a single game, which was 253 rushing yards.  Tony Hunter, who was the first-round draft pick of the Buffalo [New York] Bills [professional football team] as a tight end, the twelfth pick of the first round in our year of '83 [1983].  Tom Thayer who played with me in Chicago with the Bears [football team]--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Rusty Lisch did too, didn't he?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Rusty did, as well.  Tom, in fact, Tom and I were actually roommates our sophomore year in college.  So Tom and I were, were there together.  Stacey Toran, who ended up going to the [Los Angeles] Raiders [football team], and unfortunately lost his life in an automobile accident, while during training camp in his, I believe it was his third season, third or fourth season with the Raiders.  So a number of, of great guys.  Then on the basketball side, it would have been Orlando Woolridge, John Paxson, Kelly Tripucka and Tracy Jackson, just some great guys [University of Notre Dame basketball players].
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was a great basketball team, yeah.
Speaker 2: We went to the Final Four [NCAA- National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball playoffs] and got beat by Brigham Young [University, Provo, Utah.]  We allowed Danny Ainge to dribble the length of the basketball court in about three seconds, and an uncontested lay-up took us out.
Story_ID: 6666
Speaker 1: Did you want to play basketball?
Speaker 2: No, in fact I certainly was not, not good enough to play at that level.  I was a floor general, a point guard, but I was not, certainly not a scoring threat.  But that was never my intent.  But I was actually on a double scholarship, football and baseball, while there.  That was a caveat for me, with no matter what school I signed with for my four years, I wanted the opportunity to play baseball.  But every year, something would happen during the spring, where I would have to leave baseball and go back and play spring football.  So after my spring football season, our strong safety, strong safety, Steve Sitchy (ph.), broke his neck, the very first day of spring training, of two-a-days.  And so [University of Notre Dame head football] coach [Dan] Devine came, and I was up on the indoor pitcher's mound, just loosening up my arm, and he said, "I've, I've got to have you on the field."  So I had to walk away from baseball to go learn to play the strong safety position because I was the second largest defensive back we had.  And I had started on the corner [cornerback, defensive football position], my freshman year, but they were gonna move me inside to play strong safety.  After my sophomore year, we played [University of] Georgia [Athens, Georgia] for the national championship in the Sugar Bowl, which was Herschel Walker's freshman year.  In fact, it was down there that I met my wife, Alicia.  And so that was coach Devine's last game.  Gerry Faust takes over.  So Gerry Faust, being the new coach, wants all football players out for spring ball.  So there went my second season.  And then my third season, they were gonna move me to free safety at the end of my--of our--my junior year.  So what would have been my third opportunity to play baseball.  So I needed to be out for spring ball to learn the position of playing free safety.  But then, of course, in my senior year, I was going to NFL [National Football League] combines and focusing was on playing in the NFL so didn't even bother to, to think in terms of baseball anymore.  So, every year something occurred, you know, that kept me focused on football.  And again, it just goes to show you, the Lord works in mysterious ways.
Speaker 1: You, like a lot of other people that play high school football, was an offense star in high school--,
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and yet, you had to make the transition to defense or somewhere down the line you become a defensive player.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How did that happen, you know?
Speaker 2: Well, coach Devine gave me my choice, but, but certainly, it was--if he had had his druthers, I would have moved to the, to play, to play defense.  There was a guy by the name of Luther Bradley, who also played at, at [University of] Notre Dame [South Bend, Indiana] who was from Muncie, Indiana, who went to Storer Middle School [Muncie, Indiana] where I went and Northside High School.  And I had broken all of Luther's records, going through Storer [Middle School] and Northside [High School, Muncie, Indiana].  And so, you know, of course, he can't take credit for me getting--or wanting to go to Notre Dame.  That was on, you know, [football player] Rocky Bleier and 'Brian's Song' [motion picture], but certainly, I had extra incentive.  But I sat and I talked with Luther about--because he had to make that same choice.  He was both a running back and a defensive back.  And he pointed to his knees.  And he said, "I like these."  And that was good enough for me.  And the other thing too was that, while at Notre Dame I was gonna return punts, which I did all four years, and, in fact, I hold the, the Notre Dame record for, for punt returns with 102.  And so, so I was still gonna have my opportunity to touch the football.  And then aside from that, you know, as long as I got interceptions or recovered fumbles, I could, I could do something with it after I got the ball.  So I, I hold Notre Dame's all-time record also for yards, for return yards after--with an interception.  So I hold two records that still hold today after some twenty years at Notre Dame.  And then too, the good book says it's better to give than receive.  So based upon all that, I decided to play defense.
Story_ID: 6667
Speaker 1: You were telling us when we started the tape about draft day, and so you were--you expected to go in the first round, but you didn't.
Speaker 2: Right, I talked about law school too much.  And, you know, as my dream was, to, to use my education to get to [University of] Notre Dame [South Bend, Indiana] and my, you know, athletic ability to get me to the school of my dreams.  But, you know, again, having played football in Indiana, which is basketball country, I never dreamt, or allowed myself to, to dream even for a moment that, that, that God had actually gifted me--that, that I was, my talent level was special enough to compete on a national scale.  So I was just fortunate, you know, felt completely blessed that I was at Notre Dame, never even thinking that I had the talent to, to play there, let alone start for four years.  So the dream was to go to Notre Dame and then into Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And I made that, that plain to everyone.  But low and behold, I start for four years, all-American, and what have you and going to the NFL [National Football League] combines, you know, they ask you all this stuff, you know, as you get--you're being interviewed.  You take an aptitude test, you know, and what have you.  They want to know what, what your aspirations are, you know, to be on the playing field.  And it's kind of a setup because actually, I guess, the real, the, the right response is, "Nothing, football is my life.  I'm gonna play for fifty years."  Instead, I said, "I'm gonna go to Harvard and get a law degree and then go and own my own manufacturing business."  In 1983, that was not very well received.  In fact, even today, in pro sports, the only thing they want to hear you say is that, this is good as it gets.  And so on draft day in New York, I was there with ESPN [sports TV network], and every year, there's one kid who, you know, who hangs out for a couple of extra rounds.  And that year, it was me.  And, you know, I had prayed before the draft, "Please, God, take me anywhere but Chicago [Illinois] or Detroit [Michigan]."  And so when the phone rang, and they said, Dave, you got drafted.  And I said, "Who was it?"  And they said, "Chicago," and I just bowed my head because the Bears and the, and the Detroit Lions [football team] were the two cheapest teams in the National Football League.  They weren't paying anyone.  And, and I wanted to leave the Midwest, having grown up here and played college ball here, you know, I was hoping for some place like San Diego [California].  So, anyway, get to the phone. It's [Chicago Bears head coach] Mike Ditka and before he said hello, he said, "Son, this will be the only time your education will hurt you."  And so, again, another of those defining moments where, you know, I got the wakeup call that this is a profession that does not appreciate an education.
Speaker 1: As a history, sort of an anti-intellectual history of NFL (laughs)--.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, but it's, but it runs greater than just Mike Ditka.  It's, it's the league itself.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not just Ditka.
Speaker 2: It's not just him.  However, the opposite is true when I got to New York, and, you know, Ditka had cut me after I had had my fourth All-Pro year, and I was a Pro Bowl alternate, which would have been my fifth year.  And I was called into his office and said, "We're moving in a different direction."  And so I had no idea what that meant, you know.  And, and I should have because of, with a business undergrad [degree], but didn't know exactly what that lingo meant.  So I said, "Okay, Mike, what, what does that mean?"  He says, "Well, I'm letting you go."  So I said, "Okay, well, where, where am I headed," you know, because you trade All-Pros.  And he said, "No--," and he had a little smile on his face.  He said, "I'm just gonna let you go," which means I'm cut.  And so my value drops.  In other words, I'm just like anybody else on the street trying to find a job.  I've got no marketability.  And so that day, it took a couple of hours to clean out my locker.  And when I got back home there were--I, I knew I was fired, as I, as I was driving up the street and my house came into view, there were fourteen live TV and radio vans at my home.  And that's when it hit me, that I had just been fired.  And that day, I got fired six times, WGN Radio, Channel 5--NBC Channel 5, Blue Cross/Blue Shield [insurance company], Chicagoland Chevy [Chevrolet].  They couldn't get to the house quick enough to pick up the Corvette [automobile].  It was a rough day.  You know, the [Chicago] Bears, rough day.  But a week later, I ended up in New York with the Giants [football team].
Story_ID: 6668
Speaker 1: Let's talk about the [Chicago] Bears [National Football League team] and when you got to the Bears.  This is, what, what did you know about [coach] Mike Ditka and the Chicago Bears. I think George Halas [owner of Chicago Bears] was still alive, wasn't he?  'Papa Bear' was still alive.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) George, 'Papa Bear', in fact, he was alive.  He passed away that year, my rookie season.  Chicago [Illinois] was a short sprint from South Bend.  So the four years I was at [University of] Notre Dame [South Bend, Indiana], we'd come over on some Sundays and, and watch the Bears plays.  And it was very easy to get tickets to Bear games back in those days because they were, were sorry.  They were quite sorry.  What I knew of Mike Ditka is that, is that he was a tough guy and that he had just drafted this, this small, middle linebacker, Mike Singletary, that nobody expected a whole lot from and that, you know, but it was a, it was a city that, on defensive side, always talked about its linebackers, but as far as I was concerned, it was a city of, of Gary Fencik and Doug Plank [Chicago Bears players].  And so--.
Speaker 1: Those are two hard-hittin' safeties.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Two very, very hard-hitting' safeties, and, you know, with an incredible reputation.  Growing up in Indiana, we got both the, the Bear games and the Cincinnati [Ohio] Bengals.  Those were the two teams we saw.  So my wife and I, as we were driving across the [Chicago] Skyway coming into Chicago, you know, I'm reporting to the city, and we're looking at the skyline, and I said, "Baby, you see that?  Some day we're gonna own this like, like Gary Fencik and Doug Plank."  And so I show up at training--at mini-camp.  And my very first day, you know, Ditka embraced me and, you know, I was one of his draft picks.  Well, I came to find out very quickly that I was [Bears coach] Mike Ditka and Jim Finks's pick.  But I was not [Chicago Bears Defensive Coordinator] Buddy Ryan's pick.
Story_ID: 6669
Speaker 1: Tell us about Buddy Ryan.
Speaker 2: Well, Buddy Ryan is a different kind of guy.
Speaker 1: He was the [Chicago Bears] defensive coordinator.
Speaker 2: He was the defensive coordinator, from Kentucky.  He's what the rest of the world would classify as, as truly a redneck.  And, and I, and I don't say with a, with a racial overtone.  But Buddy is just a different kind of guy.  And in that regard, either, either you were his guy or you weren't.  And so, and he made his self known to me very quickly.  In fact, on my very first day there, he says, "[University of Notre Dame] Golden Domer, you one of those doctors or lawyers?"  I said, "Yes sir."  He said, "Well, you won't be here too long."  And then his second comment was, "Because I don't like smart niggers."  So, that was my wakeup call, another one of those defining moments in my life.  And so I just, I just stood there, stone-faced, didn't say a word.
Speaker 1: Had you ever heard this kind of language before, in football?
Speaker 2: No, nobody, nobody had ever said anything like that to me before and certainly not, not a grown adult.  And if anyone else my age had said, then, you know, Dave would have dealt with it his way.  But, no, no one had ever come at me that way.  But, but in that moment, I, I froze.  I didn't say a word.  I just looked at him.  And so for the, the three years I worked for Buddy Ryan, there was this constant love/hate, where I mean, you know, I'd, I loved the idea that he couldn't break me.  And I loved the idea that, you know, every week we would have to take a test, you know, before the game, that he would give you test.  And I grade out of his test a hundred.  And then he'd grade you, over the course of the game and the lowest I ever got in a game with Buddy Ryan, I had one, one score of ninety-three.  But the rest of my scores were ninety-seven and above.  And you get graded out on every play.  And so, so that was the love portion.  The hate portion was that Buddy was always waiting for me to make a mistake.  And, in fact, our Super Bowl [National Football League championship game] year [1985], Todd Harr--Todd Harris--excuse me, Todd Bell and Al Harris held out, and I and Wilber Marshall got our chance to play.  And I have to thank Mike Ditka because what happened, while those guys were out trying to renegotiate their contracts, Mike Ditka had told [general manager] Jerry Vainisi, basically to hold off on the negotiations.  Not necessarily not to sign those guys, but to be hard in his, in negotiating with them because he wanted to, to give us an opportunity, Wilber and I, to show what we could do, at least during training camp in, in the preseason.  As it turned out, Al and Todd decided to hold out the entire season.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now, Todd Bell was a great safety and--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Todd was All-Pro in 1984.
Speaker 1: And Al Harris was a heck of a defensive player.
Speaker 2: Al Harris was on his way, but Todd had actually gone to his first and only Pro Bowl in 1984.  I was his, his backup.  So in replacing Todd in '85 [1985], Buddy would pull me into his office, in the very first game--we were getting ready to go play Tampa Bay [Buccaneers].  And he never called me Dave or Duerson or 'Double-D', which is my nickname, throughout the three years he coached.  He'd either make some snide comment like 'W-D', something like, you know, 'WD-40' or, or 'Golden Domer' or something like that or 'twenty-two.'  That was about as close as I could get.  But he would never call me by, by my name.  He said, "I'm just waiting for you to mess up one time, so I can get Todd back."  And so, you know so there was, you know, aside from the, the mental pressure of starting and all that other kind of stuff, I had to deal with my boss waiting for me to fail.  So again, I just, I would just sit stone-faced, and, you know, I had a little smirk on my face, I guess.
Speaker 1: How did he like Gary Fencik?  Fencik went to Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut].  How did--?
Speaker 2: Well, he didn't say he didn't like smart players.  He said didn't like smart niggers.  So (laughs), so that was the bottom line.  And, and maybe it was something about Notre Dame [University, South Bend, Indiana] too.  But, you know, Alan Page, who was a great, great, great defensive tackle and defensive end--,
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) And a very bright man too.
Speaker 2: --and a Notre Dame guy, who is now a supreme court justice in, in Minnesota, finished his career in Chicago [Illinois], played in Chicago for one or two years.  And he played under Buddy Ryan.  And I think, well, without question, Alan was above Buddy.  And I think that, that must have irked Buddy to no end.  And now, here comes another guy into, to the Bears who he didn't draft.  Now, Alan Page is a hall of famer, and he was just finishing out his career.  There was nothing Buddy Ryan can do to an Alan Page.  So I come in, and during training camp there was, one of our other tri-captains, Mark Zavagnin who was a linebacker, he was, was with, with us in training camp, he had a back injury, and his career was over.  And there was another linebacker, Mike Heimkreiter [sic, Steve Heimkreiter] who played just before me, had come over from the [Baltimore/Indianapolis] Colts [football team].  Buddy cut him.  And so he told me, "Two down, one to go."  But at any rate, we're sitting in 1985, he tells me that, he's just waiting for me to screw up one time, so he could bring Todd back.  And I played that entire season with that kind of pressure.  But by season's end, I had gone from the bench to the Pro Bowl.  And we were in New Orleans [Louisiana] at the Super Bowl and won a world championship.  And here we are at the Super Bowl party that night, and Buddy Ryan comes up to me and says, "I just want you to know, I'm still trying to get Todd back."  So, not congratulations, you did a great job.  And that was the first time that my wife understood, because she was standing beside me, just what I was dealing with.  And so my wife is actually trying to make a move for Buddy, so I block her.  And then I smiled at Buddy, and I, and I walked up to him and kissed him on the cheek.  But--.
Speaker 1: (Laughs) Similar to Bugs Bunny kissing Elmer Fudd.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Story_ID: 6670
Speaker 1: But part of the reason I was able to, to hang with [Chicago Bears Defensive Coordinator] Buddy [Ryan], is that my dad, again, because he, he fought directly under [General George S.] Patton in a, in a segregated military, believes that every male child should do two years in the armed services.  And so when I got drafted by the [Chicago] Bears [professional football team] and Buddy Ryan told me the very first day he didn't like smart niggers, my first call, of course, my only call was to my dad [Arthur Duerson Jr.] because, again, that's my hero.  So I called and told my dad, and I said, "Dad, I didn't graduate from college to go through this."  My dad said, "Well, it sounds to me like you're in the Army."  So I said, "Okay, I, I'll talk to you later."  So that was the, the shortest phone call that I've ever had.  And my father's a man of few words, but in those few words, he, he said a mouthful, that's it's about perseverance, it's about standing up, it's about character, and it's about getting through the tough times.  And so that's what I did.  So Buddy couldn't shake me simply because my dad made it very clear what my purpose was in a very short phone call.  But in '85 [1985], you know, I, I have to thank my wife because, you know, I tried to take it out on everybody I hit on Sundays, but I had a lot of bad days during the week, you know, and I'd go home.  And I wasn't the--I had a very bad attitude, you know.  I'd--I mean, I, I was a loving, loving husband and loving father as best I could be, but I was dealing with a lot of stress.  Buddy Ryan was giving me the serious blues.  And my wife was, she was a real support.  But that, that Super Bowl Sunday night when Buddy made that comment, it was at that point my wife understood exactly what I was dealing with.  And, but for the next four years, we went to the Pro Bowl [National Football League all-star game], and, you know, until we got fired by, by [Chicago Bears head coach] Mike Ditka.  But it, my group, I had great years in Chicago [Illinois] miss, my teammates.  When you play with great guys like a Walter Payton, you know, the only way you can describe Walter is passion.  He was a guy who embodied what the game was all about, gave it his all, was an incredible running back.  He was small and so nothing, or not much was expected of him.  And all he did was rewrite the record books.  And when he would make contact with the defender, he exploded into the defender.  As opposed to receiving punishment, he dished out his own, his own share of punishment.  But he was a guy who loved life and, and loved his teammates, loved the game.  And so I will miss Walter, there's no question about that.  And my fondest memory of Walter, in fact, was, the very next day after we won the Super Bowl, we had nine guys flying from New Orleans [Louisiana] to the Pro Bowl.  And so, you know, we're out there at Aloha Stadium [Honolulu, Hawaii] I the first day, and, you know, I'm a first-year Pro Bowl guy, and I'm looking good.  I got my Pro Bowl jersey on, and I'm prancing around.  I'm, I'm a world champion, you know, only twenty-four hours before.  And Walter has this thing that he does to rookie Pro Bowlers.  And, you know, I'm running around, and all of a sudden I start sweating, you know.  This is a beautiful day in, in Hawaii, probably, you know, seventy-five, maybe seventy-eight degrees.  But you got an ocean breeze and so you know, just a wonderful, it's a perfect day, blue sky.  But I'm just burning up.  And then the heat starts rising from my shorts, actually from jock.  That was because Walter had placed unscented liquid heat on my jock and he had done it also to all the other first-year Pro Bowl guys.  And so Walter the prankster.  And that's the kind of guy he was, loved life, and loved having a good time.  And he lived it to the fullest.  You know, God took him away early, but Walter lived a full life.  But aside from, from Wally, playing along side of Gary Fencik was, that was a dream come true.  Two brainiacs in the defensive backfield, Gary from Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] and myself from [University of] Notre Dame [South Bend, Indiana.]  We could communicate without speaking.  And I thoroughly enjoyed playing with him.  He was a great mentor, a great friend and continues to be.  My best friend on the team was Otis Wilson, and Mike Singletary and Richard Dent, Dennis McKinnon, guys who I'm still in great touch with.  But we were a unique group of characters.  You know, [William] 'Refrigerator' Perry, Steve McMichael--'Mongo,' 'Danimal' Dan Hampton, Wilber Marshall, we called 'Pit Bull', the most tenacious guy I've ever played with.
Speaker 2: Yeah Wilber Marshall was--.
Story_ID: 6671
Speaker 1: You know, on our [Chicago Bears'] defense, we had ten All-Pros and we count Leslie Frazier in that number because Leslie should have been All-Pro in '85 [1985], would have been '86 [1986], but on a freak play, which was a double reverse, punt return in our Super Bowl, because we were embarrassing the New England Patriots, our special team coach called for a little razzle dazzle.  Leslie took the handoff and planted and the astro turf had locked his knee up, and blew his knew out and virtually ended his career.  So we were a team loaded with talent on the defensive side of the ball, but more so than that we were a bunch of characters.  And, you know, that year, only had one loss, an eighteen and one season.  And the one loss came to the Miami Dolphins [Miami, Florida] on Monday night, which was never a good day for us.  But, but you have to, to understand that part of the, the history of the Bears, when 'Papa Bear' [George Halas, Chicago Bears owner] hired [coach] Mike Ditka, he had first hired Buddy Ryan as the defensive coordinator.  So Buddy Ryan was in place, and so was the defensive staff when Papa Bear then hired Mike Ditka, who could then go out and find his offensive staff.  And so in '85 [1985] Mike had actually peered into our meeting room one day, and Buddy threw an eraser at the door and said, "These are my guys, these are my guys."  And that was the first time in three years that I had played for Buddy that Mike had actually attempted to come into our meeting room.  So on that Monday night, Mike Ditka was gonna prove to Buddy Ryan, it was his team.  So while the game was going on, Mike was pulling starters off the field and putting in our reserves.  And so, all sorts of things were, were going helter-skelter, and timing was off, and, you know, a lot of fluke plays started happening.  Dan Marino [Miami Dolphins quarterback] was already picking us apart with the, with the quick three step drop, but he was having a field day because Mike was pulling our starters off the field and sticking reserves in.  He's the head coach.  He can do that.  And, and our reserves, you know, were not prepared to play, were not part of our defensive scheme in playing against the, the Dolphins.  And so at halftime, Mike and, and Buddy Ryan got into a fistfight which was more like a catfight, it was pretty weak.  But at any rate, it was, it was a distraction we did not need.  And, you know, we were still in the ballgame, but, you know, fighting against all those fluke things, we just fell apart in the second half, based upon the fight that Mike and Buddy were having.  Mike had no intentions of ever winning that game, and it was just--his message was to prove to Buddy, it was his football team.  And I can say that because--
Speaker 2: That's (unclear)--.
Speaker 1: --when we went through the playoffs that same year, and we shut out the New York Giants.  We shut out the Los Angeles Rams [Los Angeles, California], and we would have shut out the New England Patriots [Boston, Massachusetts] in the Super Bowl [National Football League championship game], but in the very first series, Walter fumbled on the twenty-three yard line, very--right after kick off.  And so the Patriots had already gotten the ball in, in scoring range.  We pushed them back to the, I believe it was the thirty-three, or maybe they got on the twenty-eight, and we pushed them back to, to the thirty-three.  But anyway, we pushed them back five yards, but they were still in field goal range.  So in, in essence, the Patriots had scored before our defense ever got on the field, and for all Bear fans, anybody who knows anything about pro football, you know, that Walter Payton did not score a touchdown in that forty-six to ten win over the Patriots.  That's because Mike Ditka punished Walter for the fumble.  Now, when the Patriots scored their touchdown, Kevin Butler was playing in the secondary, whose our kicker, Maury Buford, our punter was, was playing.  In other words, we had all the reserves on the field.  And we didn't care whether they scored because, well, they had already put up three points, so what, what's the difference if they get a total of ten.  But we would have played our starters and ensured a shut out because that will never, ever happen again in the history of the National Football League.  So it, it tells you, you know, the kind of guy that Mike Ditka is.  He's a guy that holds a grudge.  It's about him, and that was the unfortunate thing, because he dismantled our football team as quickly as we won the world championship.  We should have won three in Chicago.
Story_ID: 6672
Speaker 1: I often wondered, Dennis McKinnon [Chicago Bears wide receiver] was really a vocal critic of [Chicago Bears Head Coach Mike] Ditka--,
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and he, he was out of there so quickly that second year.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, that, that he was.  You know, the one thing about the game of football, it's best to keep your mouth shut and just do your job.  And Silky [ref. to Dennis McKinnon], he, he spoke up and got ran, run out on the rail pretty quick.  But what Dennis [McKinnon] was saying was true, and he spoke the truth, but, you know, when, when that's your employer, you, you got to be careful, unless you're prepared and ready to leave.
Speaker 1: Jim McMahon [Chicago Bears quarterback], you know, he, he often seemed to ignore the regular Bear offense, and whenever there was a big success, it seemed as though it was in spite of the (laughs)--.
Speaker 2: That's, that's a nice way of saying it--(laughs) (simultaneously)--
Speaker 1: Is that true (laughs), is that true?
Speaker 2: (Laughs)
Speaker 1: Is that basically true?
Speaker 2: That was absolutely true, that Mike would call a play and Jim would get in the huddle and, and he would--Jim was audible before he got to the line of scrimmage.  He would tell the guys in the huddle, "We're not doing that.  This is what we're doing."  And, and Jim was, was a linebacker who was playing quarterback.  And he, he had a defensive mentality, and I've got great respect for, for Jim McMahon.  Here was a guy who would give us his body for the good of the team and was willing to do anything to win, and understood his role.  And, you know, another example of that is when we were down in New Orleans [Louisiana], you know, in the, in the--there, there's a radio announcer down there who, of course, lies and said that Jim had something about calling all the women in New Orleans sluts and what have you and Jim hadn't said it.  But Jim goes out, out of his way.  He's mooning helicopters and he's doing all sorts of things from a crazy standpoint, antics, being Jim McMahon, the 'Punky QB', because he drew all the attention on himself, with the media, so with the rest of our, of our offensive guards, in particular, could ready to play a football game.  And that was the genius of a Jim McMahon, a very good guy, a great family man, has a reputation for being crazy.  But that's how he made his money, you know.  He'd go into character and become the 'Punky QB'.  But a very caring guy, who, who understood his leadership role and, and genius.  So, and he would question Mike Ditka all the time, challenge him, it drove Mike nuts because Mike would signal a play, and then as he's trying to watch his play unfold, and Jim's doing something else.  But more times than not, it worked, and the perfect example was that same year we won the Super Bowl, Jim had gotten injured, and we were playing the Minnesota Vikings up in Minnesota.  And we were behind two touchdowns, and halftime, Jim's bugging Mike, "Let me play, let me play".  So Mike finally puts him in really just to, to, to get Jim away from him.  And Jim's first four passes, three were for touchdowns.  And we went on to win that ballgame, and it sort of set the tone for that entire year.
Speaker 1: It was quite a lift for the defense.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 6673
Speaker 1: [Chicago Bears Defensive Coordinator Buddy] Ryan is, was quite a character as you've already said--,
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --but do you, would you consider him a defensive genius at some point?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I would.  I, I absolutely considered Buddy a defensive genius.  That's without question.  He designed and created the '46 Defense', which it was the 46 in that, that was the number that Doug Plank wore, because the defense was designed for the strong safety and, which, of course, was the position I played in the 46.  So done right, the strong safety is gonna be the centerpiece of that defense.  And certainly, you know, it was genius for Buddy to design the defense, but in order for it to be effective, because he had designed it when he was actually coaching under Weeb Eubanks, with the New York Jets.  But the defense was not effective because you had to have two things.  You had to have bright players who could understand the X's and O's and be able to, to make multiple shifts before the snap of a ball, and they had to be talented athletically.  And it just so happened that that combination came together in '83 [1983], '84 [1984], '85 [1985] with the Chicago Bears.  As I said before, I played with ten other, or nine other All-Pros.  So it was easy for Dave Duerson to go to the Pro Bowl [National Football League all-star game].  I just simply had to do my job, and if everybody else did their job, there were enough accolades to go around.  But then, of course, when Buddy left, Vince Tobin took over as defensive coordinator.  And I had even greater success in my career under Vince Tobin.  So, so we can't give Buddy too much credit because again, the talent was there with our ball club.  But when Buddy left, and after the end of the, of the '85 [1985] season and went to Philly [Philadelphia Eagles football team], we played the, the Eagles the next year in '86 [1986].  And from a defensive perspective, I beat Buddy Ryan by myself.  I did things that day that, to this day I cannot explain.  I freaked.  I did, I had interceptions, I forced fumbles.  I had two sacks.  And I'll never forget, the game went into overtime.  And I grabbed our special teams coach, Steve Kazor, and I told him, I'm, I'm going down on, on the kickoff team.  I wasn't even on the kickoff team.  And so Steve saw this crazy look in my eyes, he said, "Okay, great, go in at the five position."  And so, you know, so I went in and I took some guy out.  I don't remember who it was.  And on the kickoff, Kevin Butler kicks off, I went down; the return man grabs the ball.  I explode into him.  He went one way, and the ball went another.  We recover.  Immediately, Kevin Butler goes onto the field, kicks a field goal, game over.  And Buddy Ryan's crying, and that was my vindication.  So never had to say a word, beating, simply with work ethic.  And at the end of the day, I never had to say a word, and he was the one who broke down--not Dave Duerson.
Story_ID: 6674
Speaker 1: You played, you were All-Pro '85 [1985], '86 [1986], '87 [1987]--,
Speaker 2: '88 [1988].
Speaker 1: '88 [1988], right.  And so you, now what happened in '89 [1989]?
Speaker 2: Well, in, in '89 [1989], I got--injured my ankle.  We [Chicago Bears] were playing the Washington [D.C.] Redskins.  Shaun Gayle came in and exploded on my, on my ankle, making a play.  And so, so I missed a couple of ballgames.  And so, and so then when the Pro Bowl voting came down, I was, I had enough votes to be the alternate in the event a player couldn't make it, but I didn't have enough votes--I was not directly voted in.  Because of those games I missed, obviously, those guys were not gonna vote me as an All-Pro if, in fact, I didn't play, you know.  You're not gonna get those votes.  So that was my--the '89 [1989] season turned out to be my last in Chicago [Illinois].  In 1990, coming to training camp, and, you know, the very last practice of, of two-a--days, [Chicago Bears defensive coordinator] Vince Tobin, says, "[head coach] Mike [Ditka] wants to see you.  So I go in, and I think we're gonna talk about our union schedule.  And I was first vice president of the [NFL] Players Association.  And then he gives me the message, "We moving in a different direction."  And so I'm released.  And so I just stood up, and, of course, I was in shock, you know.  But he said, "I'm just gonna let you go."  So I just stood up and extended my hand across the table and said, "Thanks for the opportunity."
Speaker 1: Now, is that, was that a smart move for the Bears to do that?  I mean talent aside, I mean--.
Speaker 2: Well, they, they had actually drafted Mark Carrier that year who turned out to be one hell of a, of a free safety.  But--.
Speaker 1: But they got nothing for you, for an All-Pro player.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: That doesn't seem to make any sense.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) So, from a business perspective, no, it did not make good sense.  But, you know, it, it was Mike's way of, of--how he did things because he, he made a comment before I left.  He said, "This'll, this'll be the last time I allow a player to get this much power."  And so, you know, with everything I was doing--I had been NFL [National Football League] Man of the Year in 1987.  We were running substance abuse prevention networks from the State of Indiana and the State of Illinois, here in Illinois, flying around on then [Illinois] Governor [James] Thompson's plane on a regular basis with my teammates, influencing, you know, literally people all around the country. I had my own radio show on WGN [Chicago, Illinois], which is the largest radio network in the, in the world and doing stuff with NBC [National Broadcasting Company] Channel 5.  So I had a voice.  And, you know, that was not something that, that Mike particularly cared for.  So it wasn't just me, you know, Gary Fencik, same way.  He didn't particularly care for, for Gary in that regard.  So--,
Speaker 1: I remember, yeah.
Speaker 2: --I guess it was just my turn.  He had shipped out Otis [Wilson].  He had shipped out Wilber [Marshall].  Willie Gault was gone.  Dennis McKinnon was gone.  You know, the, the makeup of our, of our ball club had changed dramatically.
Story_ID: 6675
Speaker 1: You know, a week later [after getting released from the Chicago Bears], I end up in New York with the Giants [football team].  And six months later, we won the world championship, a bunch of old guys, over-the-hill who had all lost a step.  We were all, you know, thirty-plus years old, a bunch of has-beens.  And I got a phone call from [New York Giants Head Coach Bill] Parcells.  I was on my way to Kansas City [Missouri] to play for the Chiefs.  And on that Sunday morning, the phone rang, nine, at 9:30 [A.M.].  [Kansas City Chiefs Head Coach] Marty Schottenheimer from Kansas City says, "Dave, what are you doing?"  And I told him, I said, "I'm looking at an atlas trying to figure out how to get to Kansas City."  I had to be there at 5:00 P.M. that evening.  And my car was loaded up.  And he says, "Well, what are you driving?"  I said, "A Corvette."  He said, "Don't worry about it.  Get on the plane.  I'll have one meet you at the airport."  So I told him, I said, "Okay, I'll call you back in twenty minutes, you know, gonna call and, and get my flight arrangements."  He says, "Don't give me any bad news."  And I had no idea what he was talking about.  Well, it turns out, five minutes later the phone rings.  And it was Bill Parcells calling from the New York Giants.  And he had just lost his safety the night before, Adrian White.  And he, he said that he had a Super Bowl team.  He had just signed one of my very best friends, Everson Walls, from the Dallas Cowboys [football team], and that I was the one piece he was looking for.  He needed a third down linebacker, which, you know, in the '46 Defense', that's exactly what I was, a linebacker.  He needed me to play third down.  He said, "You're not gonna start, but, but you're my missing link, and I got a world championship team."  Now, if I go to Kansas City, I'm gonna start, and it's easier--it would have been easier to have been All-Pro in the AFC [American Football Conference] at that time because all the real talented safeties were in the, in the NFC [National Football Conference], Joey Browner, Ronnie Lott, myself.  That's where the, the real challenge was.  And yet in the AFC, a lot simpler.  So if I got to the AFC, All-Pro one or two more times, and I'm guaranteed Canton [Ohio]--guaranteed the NFL [National Football League] Hall of Fame [in Canton, Ohio].  But I've got a decision I need to make very quickly.  So I called Mom and Dad [Julia Mae Duerson and Arthur Duerson, Jr.].  We get the prayer warriors working.  I called Marty Schottenheimer back, tell him I just got an offer I couldn't refuse.  And I go to New York, which in essence means, I am now retiring.  I'm, I am, I've made the decision that I'm prepared to leave the game.  And so I go to New York.  I'd just been completely devastated the week before, fired six times in one day, and go to New York, had the time of my life.  And we win a world championship, beat the Buffalo [New York] Bills in Tampa Stadium [Tampa, Florida].  And that was the year of 'Desert Storm' [U.S.-Iraq war of 1991], and again, another one of those defining moments.  Bill Parcells, if he called today, I'd seriously have to think about going back and playing at [age] forty-two.  I'll never forget, we had just beat the San Francisco 49ers in a championship game.  We were on the plane flying to Tampa.  That was the--every ten years, there's no off week between the championship game and the Super Bowl.  Generally, there's, there's a two-week lag time between the championship game and the Super Bowl. So that year, we're flying directly from San Francisco [California], when [U.S.] President [George H. W.] Bush calls Parcells to, to ask, do you really want to play this game, knowing that Tampa Stadium would, would be [Iraqi President] Saddam Hussein's number one target.  And this was right at the beginning of Desert Storm.  And so Parcells calls up his board of directors, which was the over-the-hill gang, all of us guys over thirty, up to the front of the plane.  And so I was the first one up there.  And here's Bill, sitting next to his high school basketball coach, who was his mentor, being ripped apart about every coaching mistake he made during the course of the game.  Here's a man going to his second Super Bowl [championship game of the National Football League], being ripped apart by his high school basketball coach.  And the defining moment for me is that, wow, here's a man who's still learning, who's at the, at the peak of excellence yet, he's still learning.  And, and he's humble enough to accept it.  So a defining moment for me.
Speaker 2: That's something you never saw in Chicago [Illinois with the Bears], right?
Speaker 1: Never, never saw.  And, and you would not see.  So a defining moment for me.  A week later, we win the world championship.  The next morning, Bill calls me into his office, Parcells.  And he rips me apart for two hours, giving me the 'you can make a difference' speech, and made me promise him that I would take my LSAT's [law school admission test] and I would go to law school.  He said that he'd had only one other player, Kenny Hill, who was also a defensive back, Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] undergrad, who was supposed to, to have been a physician, go to medical school, and never went.  And instead had a great NFL career and who's now a real estate magnate in Manhattan [New York, New York].  And so Bill was giving me the 'you can make a difference' speech.  And so, made me promise him that, that I would pursue my law degree and get on with my, my life's work which was to get into the world of manufacturing.
