Speaker 1: Okay.  My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My name is Essex Eugene Finney, Jr., that's spelled E-S-S-E-X, middle initial--middle name Eugene, E-U-G-E-N-E, last name Finney, F-I-N-N-E-Y, Junior, J-R.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there a story behind the name Essex?
Speaker 2: I haven't been able to trace where that came about.  The earliest I have been able to identify that name is one of my generations, about five generations ago and the person who had that name was Essex Dixon and I believe he was a brother to one of my great, great grandparents.
Speaker 1: So it's a great, great uncle I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Something like that, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And sir, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born in May of 1937 and I was born in Michaux, Virginia.  Michaux is M-I-C-H-A-U-X, which is a community in Powhatan County in Virginia near the James River.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they call it Michaux (pronounced it mee-shocks), in--
Speaker 2: Michaux (pronounced it meh-shucks).
Speaker 1: --down there unless it would be me-show otherwise.
Speaker 2: I think so, yeah.  Of course I think it's a French origin.
Story_ID: 22448
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah we were talking about the Michaux, Virginia.  So yeah, so local pronunciation of that name is meh-shocks then?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And that's in Powhatan County.
Speaker 2: Powhatan.
Speaker 1: In Powhatan.
Speaker 2: P-O-W-H-A-T-A-N, Powhatan, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Powhatan, Virginia is between the Appomattox River and the James River, about thirty miles west of Richmond [Virginia].
Speaker 1: Now is Powhatan named for--I know it's named for the father of Pocahontas, the chief you know of the--?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The Indian chief, right?
Speaker 2: There was a confederation of Indians called the Powhatans and the chief in that area was Chief Powhatan.  So I think the county was named after him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And his daughter was Pocahontas.
Speaker 2: Pocahontas, that's right.
Speaker 1: She was Pocahontas of the stories.
Speaker 2: We're very well-known, Pocahontas.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And let's see, now you said you were born May the--
Speaker 2: I didn't give a date.
Speaker 1: I know.  I didn't--that's unusual, people don't.  But--
Speaker 2: Do I need to give the date?  You know sometimes I'm concerned about privacy issues when they call they want to know your date and the mother's name and her date of birth.  And I, so I think May of 1937 is pretty close.  Do you need it?  If you will, I'll--
Speaker 1: We don't necessarily have to have it.  Let's--
Speaker 2: I can--
Speaker 1: It's okay, all right.  Okay and sir what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: I'm retired now of course.  My occupation was a research engineer and my title when I retired was associate administrator of the agricultural research service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA].  And I retired from that position in 1995 after serving for about thirty-three years with the federal government.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, and what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is July the 13th, 2012, twenty thousand twelve.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are currently at the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center in Beltsville, Maryland.  This is the largest comprehensive research center of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  And most of my career was here at the Research Center at Beltsville.  I started here in 1965 and I retired in 1995.  The last three years of my service was downtown in Washington [District of Columbia] at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, but most of my career is here at Beltsville.
Story_ID: 22449
Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth there are five lightweight questions we ask as kind of a warm up.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: No, I don't. Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: No, not a favorite color either.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: A favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Well my favorite time of the year, I really have two: one is May of course the month I was born and the other one is October which is the month that my wife was born.  But both of them are very moderate temperatures and you can open your windows to your house, air it out.  Outdoors is very comfortable so those are my two favorite months of the year.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Not really.  Not really.  We do spend quite a bit of time in my home place in Virginia but it's not necessarily a vacation.  It's sort of a working time when we go down and do a little renovating and cleaning up at the family's home place.
Speaker 1: Okay, still--
Speaker 2: But I guess if I had to select one, I would say my favorite vacation place is Bermuda.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last question is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  No.
Story_ID: 22450
Speaker 1: So you all still retain a family place in, is it in Powhatan?
Speaker 2: In Powhatan.  Yes, it's in the community of Macon, Virginia which is on the Appomattox River.  As I mentioned earlier I was born in Michaux [Virginia] which is on the James River.  The, that will be the northern side of Powhatan County, but I grew up from infant on the southern part of Powhatan County near the Appomattox River.  So we still have the family home there.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now I'm going to ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side but we'll start with your mother's side and we'll keep them separate till we put your mother and father together.
Speaker 2: That's fine.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's maiden name was Etta, E-T-T-A, middle name Francis, F-R-A-N-C-I-S, last name was Burton, B-U-R-T-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in December of 1916 and she was born in Michaux, M-I-C-H-A-U-X, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace that side and what were they doing in history?
Speaker 2: The furthest I can trace her side back is around the time of the [American] Civil War at around the 18--, middle 1860s.  And I was told that the--let's see, this person would have been my mother's great grandfather.  His name was Richard Burton often referred to as Dick Burton who is said to have left Virginia to join the war during the Civil War and he was never heard from again.  So that was Richard Burton, Dick Burton who grew up in Powhatan on a place called the Bradley Plantation in Michaux, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did he--was he a slave on that plantation?
Speaker 2: He was a slave on the plantation, that's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did he run away to join the--?
Speaker 2: Run away to join the war and was never heard from again so we've lost track to him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Richard Burton had a son whose name was Robert Burton.  I don't have the exact year of his birth but Robert Burton was a Baptist preacher in Michaux, Virginia.  He also worked on a farm and grew up on a farm, raised his family on a farm there in Michaux, Virginia.  As I mentioned Robert Burton was a well-known minister in the Michaux area.  He was the pastor of Antioch Baptist Church on Route 522 in the Michaux community and he was also the pastor of Shiloh Baptist Church near the Michaux community in Powhatan, Virginia.  I believe he died about 1925 and at that time he preached every Sunday.  He preached at Antioch Baptist Church on the first and third Sunday and Shiloh Baptist Church on the second and fourth Sunday.  Of course those were African American churches--
Speaker 1: Most of the names--
Speaker 2: --and they're still very active today.
Speaker 1: Yes sir and those names resonate in every black community there's a Shiloh Baptist--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --Antioch Baptist, yeah.
Speaker 2: That's exactly right.
Speaker 1: So many communities have those.  Also is--I have to ask this question.  I don't know if this--because of the name, I just wonder if--well I don't know.  I shouldn't probably ask but were there any actually Michaux, I mean black people named Michaux down in Michaux?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of.  But there were other black families in Powhatan who had the name Michaux.  But I'm not aware of any who lived in that Michaux community.  They may have lived there earlier and migrated to other parts of the county but I cannot attest to that.
Speaker 1: You know the famous Reverend Lightfoot Michaux--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --of New York and--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: He had the book, big bookstore on 125th [Street] and Lennox Avenue.
Speaker 2: Oh is that right?
Speaker 1: Louis Michaux.
Speaker 2: I see.  Yeah I've heard that name periodically in other places.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So I just wondered you know if that was their origin or if they were from down there.
Speaker 2: I see. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well it wouldn't be unusual because many of the families who originated in Powhatan, other places in Virginia of course migrated north and many of them went to New York [City, New York] and Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and the larger cities.  So it wouldn't be unreasonable if that were to be true, there was a relationship.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, all right so we were at the Robert Burton, Reverend Robert Burton.  He would be your mother's--
Speaker 2: Grand--
Speaker 1: --grandfather.
Speaker 2: Grandfather, that's correct.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And my mother's father was also named Robert Burton but he was Robert Nicholas Burton.  That would be my grandfather on my mother's side.  And Robert Nicholas Burton who was well--popular and known as Nick was a deacon at Antioch Baptist Church where his father was a pastor.  And Robert Nicholas Burton had a brother, Reverend Clarence Burton.  His brother also followed his father as the pastor of Antioch Baptist Church, Reverend Clarence Burton.  So the Burtons have had a long association with the Antioch Baptist Church there in the Michaux community.
Speaker 1: And then they passed down the story about their ancestor who left for the war--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --and never came back.
Speaker 2: That's right.  That story came from Reverend Clarence Burton.  He told the story about his ancestor Dick Burton who left during the war and never was heard from again.
Speaker 1: Okay. So your mother's side of the family has a big history in the church life of the community there.
Speaker 2: That's correct.  Yes, very much so.
Story_ID: 22451
Speaker 1: What about the females on that side [Finney's mother's side of the family], any stories about them?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Let's start first with my mother's [Etta Burton] mother.  My mother's mother was Janie Maston, M-A-S-T-O-N from the Jefferson community in Powhatan [Virginia] which is not very far from the Michaux community [Virginia].  They're almost adjoining communities.
Speaker 1: Now how do you spell her last name again?
Speaker 2: Maston, M-A-S-T-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Janie Maston.  Janie Maston was born about 1890 and she died in 1975.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--
Speaker 2: Janie Maston's father was Henry Maston and I don't have any information on his date of birth or death.  And Janie's mother was an Ellis, Nancy Ellis, E-L-L-I-S, also from the Jefferson community.
Speaker 1: So the Jefferson community, that's a--
Speaker 2: Named after President Thomas Jefferson and that's in Powhatan County off of Route 522 in Powhatan.  And it's about--, Jefferson would be about three or four miles from the Michaux community.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there any reason why it's named for Jefferson other than the fact that--?
Speaker 2: Not that I know of.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Not that I know of.
Speaker 1: Jefferson's from Chancellorsville [Virginia] up in that area.  That's Monticello [President Thomas Jefferson's plantation in Charlottesville, Virginia] and all that.
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I think Thomas Jefferson had a brother named Peter Jefferson who lived in that community and it may very well have been named after him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now were the Mastons farmers or--?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.  The Mastons were born on the Fighting Creek plantation in Powhatan which is near Powhatan Court House.
Speaker 1: The Fighting Creek, huh?
Speaker 2: Fighting Creek Plantation near the court house in Powhatan and I assume that Henry Maston migrated to the Michaux community.  So I'm sure he was a laborer on the plantation which of course would be farming.
Speaker 1: Do you know the story behind Fighting Creek?
Speaker 2: Well the story was--there was an article in the 'Powhatan Today' which is a local newspaper in the county and it has a history of the Fighting Creek name.  And the--I recall it being that the Indians I guess fought many fights there in that particular area and the creek would run with blood.  And it got that name Fighting Creek, but how true that is I don't know.  But it, that was in the local paper.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Apparently in the early history there were conflicts between the Indian tribes as well as I'm sure conflicts between the white populations as they migrated into that area.  So that's the, that's all that I know about that, what might be related to the name of Fighting Creek.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So now in--
Speaker 2: I might say that the Fighting Creek Plantation was a very large plantation.  I believe it was about six or seven thousand acres or larger and was divided into four quarters by the descendants of the original owners and there's a long history behind that.  And my--the Finney family [Essex Finney's paternal side of the family] was very closely associated with the Fighting Creek Plantation and we'll discuss that probably a little later when I get into the ancestry of the Finney side of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I don't know if it's time to go into this or not but your mother's mother was a school teacher, right?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: My mother was a housekeeper.  My grandmother was a schoolteacher.
Speaker 1: Yeah, your mother's mother I was saying, yeah.
Speaker 2: No, my mother's mother was a housekeeper.
Speaker 1: Oh she was a housekeeper.
Speaker 2: Janie, she was a housekeeper too yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the--my mother was a housekeeper.  She was--kept house after she was married and Janie Burton, her mother was a housekeeper.  She took care of the family, they had a large family.  And they grew up, Janie and Nick Burton raised most of their family on the farm where they lived and they worked in Michaux and they did not build a house and move their family until around 1930 when the children were pretty much all grown.
Story_ID: 22452
Speaker 1: So did your mother [Etta Burton] talk about growing up or what--?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she often spoke about living on the plantation where she grew up and where I was born [Michaux, Virginia], about the nature of the relationship between I guess apparently there were a couple of families who lived on the farm as laborers and workers and farmers on that particular plantation.  And so she spoke often about the owners of the plantation and their relationship with the families who lived there, the African American families who grew up and raised their families there.  So it was quite interesting.  I don't know what I can add.
Speaker 1: Well can you share some of it with us?  What was it like?
Speaker 2: Well it seems to me as though it was a humorous living.  I mean she always talked about the good memories she had of growing up there and the relationship with a fellow named Claude Wilkinson who was one of the owners of the plantation.  Apparently he inter-related with the African American workers and families and that didn't seem to be any tension between the owners of the plantation and the people who worked there.  Apparently they were treated well and that's my impression of growing up there on the plantation in Michaux.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this is the--what was the name of the plantation?
Speaker 2: Well when I--
Speaker 1: Would it be the Wilkinson plant--or--?
Speaker 2: Well it had--when she was growing up there it was referred to as Lazy Oaks Farm.  And Lazy Oaks Farm was a part of the original Michaux grant.  There was a family lived in Michaux whose last name was Michaux and I don't remember the first names of them but Martin Michaux is one and the original grant of property was to the Michaux family, was granted to them by the King of England.  I guess this would be in the 1700s.  And subsequently the Michaux grant was subdivided into a number of different plantations.  The plantation where the Burtons grew up was referred to when my mother was growing up as Lazy Oaks Plantation and that's where they grew up and my mother had a quite a large number of siblings.  Janie and Nick Burton [Finney's maternal gradparents] had I think five girls.  My mother was the oldest girl and there was a Nanny, Abby, Cora and Catherine, five girls.  And then there were, the boys were Norman--, William Norman, Randolph, Julian and Nicholas.  So there would be four boys and five girls.  They all grew up on this particular farm or plantation in the 1930s and 40s [1940s] when they moved in 1930 to their own home about a mile from the plantation where they worked.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So the generations of ministers you know actually lived on a plantation until the 1930s.
Speaker 2: That's correct.  Yeah, the original Reverend Burton lived and worked on that plantation and his son Clarence who is a minister lived and worked on the plantation until he finally moved with his family to the Jefferson community [Virginia], got a home and moved there.  But they all were born, raised and became adults, started their families on this plantation before they were able to acquire land and build their own home.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, okay.  Now did--was there a--did your mother have stories of going to school and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: No, she never spoke too much about going to school.  She did go to school and I knew she went to the elementary school.  I'm not too sure she went to high school because I expect when she would have gone to high school there was not a high school in Powhatan for black students so I don't think she finished high school but she did complete elementary school and she could read and write and could function very well from an educational standpoint.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now the Virginia she grew up in was segregated of course.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: So she would have attended an all black school?
Speaker 2: All black schools yes, and as I did from elementary school to high school.  I finished high school in 1954 which was the year that the [U.S.] Supreme Court ruled that segregated schools was unconstitutional [Brown vs. Board of Education, 1954].  But when my parents, grandparents and their siblings grew up it was a segregated school system.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did your mother have an aspiration that she wanted to attain or a special talent or something that she--?
Speaker 2: No.  I don't think so.  I never heard her express it.  The main aspiration that she would like to have had was her own home.  She lived with my father and my grandparents in the Macon [Virginia] community.  And I know she always commented it would be nice to have her own home instead of living with grandparents.  But that was the only aspiration I had heard her express as far as when she was growing up.
Story_ID: 22453
Speaker 1: So let me go to your father's side.  Can you give us your father's--well he's named the same as you right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Same name, Essex Finney--
Speaker 2: Essex Eugene Finney--
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was--?
Speaker 2: --Senior.  Now he was, he never used the name Essex.  He was always known as Eugene so if anyone were speaking about my dad they would say, how is Eugene or where is he?  They never gave him the name Essex and I think that is because the name Essex occurred in the earlier generations and I think when he was growing up it probably would have been confusing if they had referred to him as Essex when there were two or three other Essexes in the community.  So he was referred to as Eugene.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born in July of 1912.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: And he died in February of 2003.
Speaker 1: So he was ninety-two or ninety-three when he passed?
Speaker 2: He would have been 93.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay--
Speaker 2: He would have been, let's see.  He was born 1912, died 2--he would have been ninety-one when he died if he had lived to July.
Speaker 1: And was he born in Michaux?
Speaker 2: He was born in Macon, Virginia.
Speaker 1: In Macon, Virginia.
Speaker 2: Macon, Virginia yes.  The Finney family grew up in the Macon community near the Appomattox River in Powhatan [Virginia].
Speaker 1: So what can you tell us about the ancestors on your father's side?  How far back can you trace them and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: I can trace them back to 1843.  I don't know if you want to go back from my father back to the earlier ones or start from the earlier time and move forward.  Which would be preferable?
Speaker 1: Well let's start with the earlier ones and move back?
Speaker 2: The early ones.  The earliest one that I have specific information with is my father's grandmother.  Her maiden name was Susan Epps, S-U-S-A-N E-P-P-S.  Susan Epps was born in 1845, died in 1921.  Susan Epps was born in Amelia County [Virginia].  Amelia County is adjacent to Powhatan County.  Powhatan is on the north side of the Appomattox River.  Amelia County is on the north side of the Appomattox River so she was born in Amelia County and moved to Powhatan in around 1870 or 1874 after she was married and had a family.  Susan Epps was a nurse during the slavery on the plantation in Amelia County called the Lodge, L-O-D-G-E.
Speaker 1: L-O-D-G-E.
Speaker 2: --D-G-E.  The Lodge Plantation is just south of the Appomattox River in Amelia County.
Story_ID: 22454
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, describe what she [Susan Epps, born in 1845, who was Finney's paternal great grandmother] did as a nurse on the--
Speaker 2: Well I believe as a nurse she was responsible for caring for the children of the owners of the plantation property at the Lodge [Plantation].  That was a traditional responsibility of some of the slaves who worked in the mansion or in the slave home was look after the children, be a nurse to the children.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Not I understand she also was a member of the Flower Hill Baptist Church in Amelia County [Virginia] which was very close to the large Lodge, the Lodge Plantation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Susan Epps married a man named Essex Finney.  Essex Finney was a slave on the Fighting Creek Plantation in Powhatan County [Virginia].  As I mentioned earlier, the Fighting Creek Plantation in Powhatan is located near the Powhatan Courthouse near, just off of the Appomattox River in Powhatan, and Essex Finney was a slave on that plantation.  I'm not quite sure how he met Susan Epps, but there was some indication that at some point in time Susan Epps also worked at the Fighting Creek Plantation.  The Fighting Creek Plantation was owned by a medical doctor, a physician who served both Powhatan County residents and Amelia County residents.  This physician was John Harvie, H-A-R-V-I-E, who lived and served in both Powhatan and Amelia.  He lived at the Fighting Creek Plantation but served both counties.  So I'm not sure whether or not Susan Epps had an occasion to meet Essex Finney in Amelia or in Powhatan but there is some indication that she did at one time also work at the Fighting Creek Plantation so that's maybe how they met each other.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Essex Finney's parents were John Finney who was said to be a Powhatan Indian and Mary Ann Dixon, D-I-X-O-N.  So there would be a generation then ahead of Essex and Susan Finney.  So since Essex and Susan Finney were born in the 1840s, it's very likely that John Finney, the Indian, and Mary Ann Dixon, his wife would probably be in the area, born around the 1820s in that period of time.  So--but I don't have any dates for them.  You asked me what was the origin of the name Essex and the newspaper article in the 'Powhatan Today' [local newspaper in Powhatan, Virginia] some years ago, they talked about the Fighting Creek Plantation [where Essex Finney's paternal ancestors lived and worked] and its history.  One of the things they mentioned in that article was there was a renowned gardener who looked after the conservatory, the plants and the flowers and the other things related to the landscaping and the care of the grounds at the Fighting Creek Plantation.  There was a renowned gardener whose name was Uncle Essex.  This is the first time I've come across the name Essex and any association with the Finney family.  In reviewing the national archives literature on the families that lived in Powhatan during the 1860s, 1870s, I came across a name of a person in that archives whose name was Essex Dixon and it had behind his name you know on the archives they tell what is the occupation of the person and that had gardener.  Now in looking at the archives it's very rare to see a African American or a black slave have any occupation other than laborer or maybe carpenter, so he was a gardener.  So I have concluded that Essex Dixon, the gardener, was probably related to Mary Ann Dixon [Finney's paternal great, great grandmother] who would have been Essex Finney's [Finney's paternal great grandfather] mother.  So he was named after his uncle.  I, that's what I assume.  I can't swear to it but--
Speaker 1: It makes a lot of sense.
Speaker 2: It makes some--
Speaker 1: Yeah, makes a lot of sense.
Speaker 2: --some sense, yes.  So that--you asked me some time ago what was the origin of the name Essex so this is the best I can do with that name Essex.  Now the name Finney, I don't know how that came about.  But very often you know slaves took the names of their slave owners but--and Finney I think that name originates in Scotland or Great Britain, somewhere over in that area of the country the name Finney is associated with it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I don't know (unclear).
Speaker 2: Now the interesting thing about this Essex Dixon, the gardener, the article in the newspaper did refer to him as a renowned gardener who claimed to be a descendant of an African king, now that's all that I know about Essex Dixon, the gardener.
Speaker 1: So he claimed to be descendant of an African king?
Speaker 2: Of an African King.
Speaker 1: Now this article was in the 'Powhatan Today'.  And--
Speaker 2: 'Powhatan Today' newspaper.
Speaker 1: So you have any idea what the source was for that, that the--the source for his claim you know and--
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: --some letters of some--?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.  I've been trying to trace that but the lady who was probably the best historian in Powhatan who might have been able to give me more information has died.  She was Ms. Palmer was a noted historian in Powhatan, Peggy Palmer.  But I wasn't able to get anymore information on that.
Speaker 1: And the article didn't have it--?
Speaker 2: The article did not have anymore information other than having that particular phrase in the paragraph about Essex, the gardener.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It's interesting you still got some work to do with this, it's so exciting you know.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: You've uncovered some really--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --interesting facts about your family.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 22455
Speaker 1: We talked about Essex Finney, the original Essex Finney who would be my great grandfather and we talked about Susan Epps, his wife.  Now his children, he had a large family.  I can't--he had four sons, my grandfather, John Edward Finney, and I mentioned earlier there was a John Finney who was, would have been John Edward Finney's grandfather who was married to Mary Ann Dixon.  So Essex Finney had John Finney, my grandfather, Spencer Finney, Robert Finney and Essex Finney.  So here is now the Essex.  Essex Finney was married to Susan Epps had a son that he named Essex so it would be Essex, Jr.  So there were four boys and there was oh gee a large number of girls; Julia, Mary Ann, Martha, Lillie, Daisy, I think there are at least five girls.  John Finney was born in 1870, that would have been my grandfather, and died in 1951.  Three of Essex Finney's brothers grew up in the Macon [Virginia] community.  The--Essex Finney purchased the first land owned by the Finney family after slavery in 1874.  Essex Finney had a brother named Willis Finney.  So Essex and Willis Finney, two brothers, purchased thirty acres of land in 1874 for $300.00 and they raised their family on this thirty acres of land in the Macon community of Powhatan.  Essex Finney was a carpenter by trade and a millwright.  A carpenter we all know what the carpenter does.  A millwright is a person who makes and repairs the wheels, the water wheels that operate grist mills.  So Essex Finney traveled quite a bit as a carpenter and millwright and his wife and children were left to operate the farm where they lived.  So they often told the story that he would leave on Sunday night to go to work at some location where he had work to do and he would come back Saturday afternoon, riding horses of course to wherever he went.  So it was a difficult time raising a family, making a living at that time.  As I mentioned, three of John's--three of Essex and Susan Finney's sons lived in the Macon community and were farmers.  My grandfather John Finney was a farmer.  Across the road from him was his brother Essex Finney, Jr., who was a farmer and on the other corner of the road was his brother Spencer Finney.  Now Uncle Spencer was quite a talented individual.  Spencer Finney and Essex Finney were both carpenters after their father.  So Spencer Finney did not travel much but he did carpentry work and farm work and he was a blacksmith and he raised his family primarily by farming with some carpentry work on the side.  Essex Finney was primarily a carpenter and did farm work on the side.  That is Essex Finney, Jr.  Let's see, what else can I tell you about them.  The fourth son Robert Finney, Robert Louis Finney, was born in 1875, was the first member of the family to go to college.  He went to what we now know as Virginia State College [University] in Petersburg [Virginia].  I think at the time he went it was called a [Virginia] Normal and Industrial Institute instead of a college.  Robert Finney went to school, went to college after he finished school to be a teacher so when he finished his college education he became a teacher and he married a young lady from Cumberland County [Virginia].  Cumberland County is the adjacent county west of Powhatan.  A--he married a young lady named Nannie Dungee, N-A-N-N-I-E Dungee, D-U-N-G-E-E.  And so Robert Finney moved to Cumberland County where he married Nannie Dungee and lived on property owned by the Dungee Family.  So Nannie Dungee was a teacher, Robert Finney was a teacher so they taught school and also operated a farm.  The interesting thing about the two of them is that they home schooled their children.  They had about ten children and all of them were home schooled because both of them were teachers so they taught their children themselves until their children were able to go away to school.  And they all, nearly all of his children went to college and got a college training.  So anyway, those are the four sons.  I can't go into all of the daughters but there was one daughter I missed that Essex and Susan Finney had and that was Hattie Hewett.  Hattie Hewett lived in the Mohemenco Community of Powhatan and was a school teacher so she had gone to school also to get training as a teacher.
Speaker 2: How do you spell Mohemenco?
Speaker 1: M-O-H-E-M-E-N-C-O.  And quite obviously it's an Indian name.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right, so these are your--?
Speaker 1: These are my great aunts and great uncles.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 22456
Speaker 1: Then your father [Essex Eugene Finney] comes along.
Speaker 2: My father--, John as I mentioned I--Essex and Susan Finney had a son named John Edward Finney and interesting enough this John Finney, that name appears two generations before associated with the Powhatan Indian Heritage.  So John Edward Finney was born in 1870, died in 1951.  John Edward Finney purchased a hundred acres of land adjacent to his father, Essex and Susan Finney property in the early 1900s.  John Edward Finney married Fannie Peyton, P-E-Y-T-O-N Johnson from Amelia County.  So Fannie Johnson grew up in the Amelia County [Virginia] area near Pleasant Grove Baptist church and was a member of that church all of her life.  John Finney was a farmer and Fannie Finney was a school teacher.  I never knew my grandfather John Finney to do any work other than farming.  When I knew him his health had begun to fail so he did not do much work but my father had farmed with his father, my father Eugene Finney farmed with John Finney.  So my father really did most of the farm work after my grandfather became--health began to fail.  My father was born as I mentioned earlier 1912 and died in 2003.  John and Fannie Finney had I believe twelve or thirteen children.  The children of John Finney, the boys were Clifford, Clifford Finney who grew up in Long Island, New York when he became an adult.  John, he had a son named John Finney also who we call Jack.  Jack also moved to Long Island and raised his family in Bridge Hampton, New York.  Albert Finney, Eugene Finney and Emery Finney were the sons of John and Fannie Finney.  And the daughters of John and Fannie Finney were Annie Juanita who was a Willis, Connie Hunter, Margaret Valentine, Jeanette Campbell, Novella Ambrose and Lillian Johnson.  So those were the daughters of John and Fannie Finney.  Most of the children who John and Fannie brought into this world moved to other places after they became adults.  My father was the only one of the family to stay on the farm, work the farm and raise his family on the farm in Powhatan in Macon [Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay.  I want to ask you like where did Fannie Finney go to school, your grandmother?
Speaker 2: She went to Ingleside Institute.  Now Ingleside Institute I know nothing about other than that it was a place that African American students could go for, to further their education.  Because when she grew up she did not--there were no high schools for African American students.  So they went to this Ingleside Institute where they got a high school education and enough education so that they could teach when they came out and finished their education.
Speaker 1: So it was like a normal school [for training teachers]?
Speaker 2: Something like that, um-hmm, yes.  And I'm not sure where Ingleside was located but I have the impression it was somewhere either in Virginia or North Carolina, very close to the Amelia County.
Speaker 1: Is that with an 'I' or an 'E', the Ingleside?  Is it spelled with an 'I'?
Speaker 2: 'I', it starts with an 'I'.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22457
Speaker 1: Alright, so, and now what did your father [Essex Eugene Finney] say about growing up?  Now he was the only one to stay on the farm?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, my father was the only one to stay on the farm and grow up on the farm, make his living on the farm.  My father did not read or write and I think that he had what we might call what, dysflexia or something like that?
Speaker 1: Dyslexia.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Dyslexia.
Speaker 2: He had great difficulty reading and writing so he did not finish school. But if you were to meet him, have a conversation with him, interact with him, you would never know that he could not read or write.  He did everything that anyone else would do.  He drove a car.  He traveled.  He handled his money so it's a very interesting background.  Now he was not a great conversationalist when you came to expressing his aspirations.  But he was a very caring person, would do anything for you and worked very hard throughout his life.
Story_ID: 22458
Speaker 1: So that's my father's [Essex Eugene Finney] background.  My father did, later in life as--after my grandfather [John Finney] died, he did take on other work.  I know he worked part-time at a saw mill to gain extra funds and in the last ten or fifteen years of his life he worked for the highway department and that--did farming on a part-time basis rather than full-time.  So I believe he retired from the [U.S.] Department of Highways about 19--, around 1970 and of course he died 2003 following a stroke that left him disabled.
Story_ID: 22459
Speaker 1: Now is there a story about how your parents [Etta Burton and Essex Eugene Finney] met?
Speaker 2: I don't know how they met.  I suspect that they probably met at a church because my grandmother was very--my grandmother Fannie Finney was very active in the church community and of course my mother, father was a deacon at the church and her grandfather was a minister who traveled around from church to churches.  So that's the only guess I have is that they probably met at some type of church function.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So is there any stories about their courtship or--?
Speaker 2: No, I don't have too much about that.  They were married in 1936 or 1937 and I was born in '37 [1937], May of '37 [1937] and I moved to, from Michaux [Virginia] to the Macon [Virginia] farm while I was an infant.  So I have no background information on that courtship or what happened before they got married and moved to Macon.
Story_ID: 22460
Speaker 1: So when you think about their--in fact, tell us something about their talents [Finney's parents, Etta Burton and Essex Eugene Finney], their personalities their looks.  And when you consider all that, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Gee, it's hard to say.  It's hard to say.  I admired both of them.  I loved both of them very much and they were both very nurturing and my mother and dad got along extremely well.  And they were very active with the church and of course my grandmother was active with the church.  My grandfather John Finney rarely went to church which I found very interesting with his wife was very active in the leadership roles with the church and the Baptist convention.  And about the only time I knew him going to church was when they had the homecomings in the summer he would put on his blue suit and go to church.  But I never knew him to go inside the church.  He would sit outside and visit with all of the people who would come home and have a great conversation with them.  But he was a member of the church so I expect earlier in his life he probably was more active.  But when I knew him, he was an old man and not very active with the church.  But his church was Liberty Baptist Church in Amelia [County, Virginia] and in fact they have his name on one of the benches so I guess one of the children donated a bench to the church in his honor.  But--and when I knew him, I never knew him to be active with the church.  But my mother and father went to church every Sunday and of course I was active with the church and with the Sunday school.  So those were the things that I guess I remember most about them and they were very hard workers on the farm and in the--my mother took care of the house and my dad worked the fields and brought in the income for the family.  Now my [paternal] grandmother taught school when I was a young person and so she had income that supplemented what came in from the farm.  My grandmother Fannie Finney taught me when I went to elementary school.  I went to Pine Hill Elementary School in the Macon community [Virginia].  She taught there the entire time until she suffered a stroke in 1947 and then my--one of her daughters then, Novella Ambrose, Novella Finney, Novella Ambrose [married name], came and took over the teaching position at the elementary school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's the background that I remember growing up on the farm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now tell us can you name your brothers and sisters for us and tell us where you fit in them?
Speaker 2: My brothers and sisters?
Speaker 1: If you have, do you have--?
Speaker 2: I don't have any brothers or sisters.
Speaker 1: You don't have any!
Speaker 2: I was the only child.
Speaker 1: Only child, okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's unusual because most of the families had ten or twelve children but my mother and dad only had one child so I guess after they gave birth to me they figured that was enough.
Speaker 1: Yeah, cause the farm, these farming families have usually a large--
Speaker 2: Large families that's right, yes.
Speaker 1: So when you were growing up then your household consisted of your--you lived with your grandparents right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My household consisted of John, Fannie Finney, my [paternal] grandparents, my mother and my father, Eugene and Etta and I had two cousins growing up with me when I was living at home.  One was Virgil Finney who was Albert's [Finney's paternal uncle, Albert Finney] son and Lonnie or Lawrence.  They lost their mother and so they, John and Fannie Finney assisted in raising them.  They also had other grandparents that they spent time with as well.  So those were the people in the household.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now when my grandmother suffered a stroke in '47 [1947], one of her daughters came home to nurse her, to help because my mother was taking care of the house.  So my Aunt Lillie who was living in New Jersey came home.  She had training in nursing to look after my grandmother after she suffered the stroke that left her disabled.  And of course her other, another one of her daughters Novella, came home and lived in the household because she taught school, the elementary school in the community, Pine Hill Elementary School.
Story_ID: 22461
Speaker 1: Now can you describe the house you grew up in [Macon, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: The house I grew up in was a typical farm house.  It had two floors.  On the bottom floor was a kitchen, dining room, living room and a bedroom.  And upstairs would have been three bedrooms and a bath.  Now I might mention that the bathroom was put in, in 1945 so when I--for about seven or eight years, 1937 to 1945 there was no bathroom.  You had outdoor facilities.  But the bathroom was put in, in '45 [1945].  Electricity was put in about the same time.  So that was a great convenience.  But anyway that's the house, a two-story frame house with four bedrooms, kitchen, dining room and living room.  And the house was built by John Finney's [Finney's paternal grandfather] father and his brothers.  They were carpenters so they built the house around 1910 or 1912.  My father [Essex Eugene Finney] was the first child born in that house.  Before they built the house that I grew up in there was another family home further back in the woods and my [paternal] grandmother [Fannie Finney] decided she wanted to be closer to the road so she could keep up with what was going on in the community so they built a new house out closer to the road.
Story_ID: 22462
Speaker 1: Yes, you had one correction to make, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  So when we were discussing my mother's [Etta Burton] side of the family I mentioned my grandmother Janie Burton whose mother was, I gave her name, her mother's name as Nancy Ellis.  Her name was Cora Ellis, C-O-R-A, Cora Ellis of the Jefferson community [Virginia].
Story_ID: 22463
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well growing up in the community on a farm, the sounds that I always found interesting were the owls at night who made their unique calls at night and of course the birds in the morning when you first wake up they're quite active.  And the, of course the roosters crowing in the morning telling you to get out of bed.  The smells, well the, the smells that I found most prevalent of course were the smells of the animals which weren't very good.  So, but you get accustomed to that when you work around horses and cows, chickens, pigs.  So those are the things that I remember on the farm growing up in Macon [Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Sights and--?
Speaker 2: Sights?  Sights are sunrise and sunsets.  The, particular on the, in the evenings when the sun go--you get a beautiful sunset to the west.  And of course at night the moon and the stars, those are the sights that I found quite enjoyable.
Story_ID: 22464
Speaker 1: I take it it's a pretty part of the country [Powhatan, Virginia] because a lot of the people that live there go back there you know a lot.
Speaker 2: Yeah it's very relaxing.  It's very relaxing, the big oak trees which are on the, in the yard.  Even when we go back and visit now if you leave the city and when you go and sit under the big oak tree it seems as though some of the things that you worry about are not that important.  I remember when I went back when President [Jimmy] Carter was president and they were having a discussion of the Panama Canal, whether or not the United States would relinquish the Panama Canal to Panama.  And the congressmen and the senators and the politicians they were raising all Cain and you would think they were going to impeach Carter if he gave the Panama Canal back.  When I went down to Powhatan and sat under the big oak tree with my uncles, that didn't seem to be important.  They were--what's the big problem in Washington [District of Columbia] and what is all this combat going on there?  So it's just a more relaxing environment when you get out into the countryside.
Story_ID: 22465
Speaker 1: Now what crops did your father [Essex Eugene Finney] raise on the farm [in Macon, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Well the major money crop was tobacco.  The other crops were wheat, corn, soy beans, hay those were the major crops that we raised.  I think those were the main ones.  Now the tobacco crop was one that I wasn't very enthusiastic about because it was a year round job from the time you sell your tobacco in December and then January or February you make up the plant bed for the new plants.  Then in the, May in the spring, you prepare the field and you plant each plant hand by hand, row by row and then after they become established you have to go out with a hoe and chop each plant for the weeds, break the tops out, break the suckers off, pick off bugs and then in the fall you have to go and cut each crop, hang it up on sticks, take it to the--it was just a year round labor intensive operation.  Now I always thought that--why are we messing with tobacco with all this labor involved?  You could plant wheat or corn, you plant it, you harvest it.  It's not a lot of labor involved.  But I think the, there are two reasons I guess that the farmers did tobacco.  It was a very lucrative crop to harvest and sell per acre that is, on a small acreage you could make a nice sum of money.  The second thing I think is tradition.  It had been a tradition to raise tobacco.  It was a long tradition in the South, particularly North Carolina and Virginia to raise tobacco.  But I never was enthusiastic about it because the intensive labor that it required year round.
Speaker 1: Now did most of the people in the area smoke?
Speaker 2: Not in my family.  We raised tobacco, sold tobacco but most of the people in the family did not smoke.  In fact my grandmother would raise Cain if you had a--she caught you with a cigarette.  So it was discouraged and neither my father or my grandfather or uncles did not smoke.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I just wondered if when you were growing up if people discussed hazards of smoking or--
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: --or the health hazards of--?
Speaker 2: That was not a big issue when I was growing up.  That became more public consciousness in the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s] when there were efforts made to make people more aware of the hazards of smoking as it relates to your health.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And future generations will probably look at this and wonder you know or have, or be unfamiliar with a time when most adults smoked.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's true.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  In an era I think you and I were raised in you know most adults were smokers.
Speaker 2: Yeah well I, I noticed that most of my family who, particularly the men after they left home to go to New York or away, they would sort of, some of them took up this idea that smoking was the thing to do but not too many of them.  But most of the members or most of my aunts who married, their husbands smoke, but very few from my family who grew up as a, as relatives smoked.
Speaker 1: That's interesting in tobacco country.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so your father had about 200 acres, I mean--?
Speaker 2: My grandfather [John Finney].  My grandfather had 200 acres.  One acre-one hundred acres where the home place was located and then there was another farm on the Appomattox River about a half a mile away, another hundred acres where, which he purchased later after he purchased the home place.  But most of the crops were grown on the property where the house, the home, the farm house was located.  On the river farm there were only two small acreages there that that we could grow crops.  It was mostly pasture land and timber land.
Story_ID: 22466
Speaker 1: Now you started school in Pine Hill [Elementary School, Macon, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Pine Hill.  The Macon community, there are two buildings that were sort of the central part of the community as far as the black community was concerned.  One was the elementary school, Pine Hill Elementary School, and right adjacent to the elementary school was a church, Pine Hill Baptist Church.  So that was sort of the focal point of the religious and social activities that, in the Pine Hill community for the African American community.  So yes, I started school at Pine Hill Elementary School where my grandfather was a teacher and I started at six years old and I was able to be promoted to two grades during my first year.  I completed the first year and the second grade requirements during the first year so I sort of got ahead one year.
Speaker 1: Now were you the beneficiary of home, some home schooling before you started?
Speaker 2: Well of course my mother [Etta Burton] and grandmother [Fannie Finney] would read to me and teach me alphabets and numbers and things like that so I was able to get a head start.  I think that's why I was able to do two grades the first year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how many students did Pine--was Pine Hill like a one-room?
Speaker 2: Pine Hill School was a one-room school and when I started it had first grade through the seventh grade. So you had students who were six years old and you had students who were teenagers.  And to a certain extent, some of the older students would help the first and second grade students with some of their work.  So the teacher did have unofficial assistance with the older students helping the younger students.  Now how many students were in that school, I would say that's probably about forty students from first grade to seventh grade and they came from surrounding communities, Macon community, the Bologna community, Ballsville community, those are other communities that are not far away, came by bus.  School bus would bring them in the morning and pick them up in the afternoon.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did, was your grandmother the only teacher?
Speaker 2: She was the only teacher, yes.
Speaker 1: So just thinking about that--
Speaker 2: That was quite a challenge.
Speaker 1: Yeah, forty students--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was quite a challenge.
Speaker 1: --at different levels.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You, sometimes you wonder how they did it but they did what they had to do.  And the school was a one-room school.  I remember very well on the front of the school was a picture of [President] George Washington hung on the front behind the teacher's desk.  Stand up in the morning and give your salute to the president, say your pledge of allegiance.  And then the, at lunch time there was a lady, lived near the school, who would bring in lunch for the students, Ms. Addie Green, A-D-D-I-E, Addie Green.  One student, one or two students would go up to her house and help her bring the lunches in for the students at lunch time. So that was a treat.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she--you didn't have to bring lunch from home?
Speaker 2: Didn't have to bring lunch from home, that's right.
Speaker 1: All right, so all right.  So did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: No I didn't have any particular favorites.  I enjoyed all of them um-hmm, and I did pretty well in all of them.  Reading, writing and arithmetic I guess were the three main things that you were taught in elementary school.
Speaker 1: So did you go to school nine months out of the year or did you--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you started in September and you finished up in May.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now later on in elementary school after the first through the fifth grade or sixth grade, they did open up a new, not a new but a different building for some of the middle school grades.  So later on when my grandmother was teaching the, sort of the sixth, seventh and eighth grades were not taught in this one-room school.  They went to a building down near the courthouse that was an old fair building for African Americans.  They had turned that building into a middle school for African American students.  So when I went to sixth and seventh grade I went to a different school down near the courthouse so that was a big help to my grandmother taking some of the grades away.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you, at age six you would have been what, I'm forgetting the year of your birth here.  So--
Speaker 2: I was born in '37 [1937].
Speaker 1: '37 [1937], so yeah.
Speaker 2: So that would have been 1943 I would have started elementary school.  So around 19--, probably around 1945 or '46 [1946] I then went to this new middle school for my, finish up my elementary grades.
Story_ID: 22467
Speaker 1: Now what did you like to do growing up?
Speaker 2: What did I like to do?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well I liked to farm.  I enjoyed farming.  I, in fact I had my own pigs that I would grow for myself.  My father [Essex Eugene Finney] would allow me to have pigs and feed them and bring them--I had to sell them and when I sold them I got the money for myself so I enjoyed farming.  I didn't have any other things that I did other than liking to ride a bicycle, playing softball on the weekends but I enjoyed the farming experience.  I thought it was a great experience.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The--farming I think teaches young people the work ethic because when you grow up on a farm or as soon as you are able to do certain things like go and bring wood into the house or feed the chickens or feed the pigs or do something, you were given a job to do and work to do and so you developed the habit of being responsible for something and so I enjoyed it.  One of the things that we did I thought that in the summer time there was an experience called threshing wheat.  I don't know if you're familiar with that but when I was growing up on the farm you would cut the wheat in June and stack it in the field in stacks.  And then in the first week of July, all of the farmers would get together and go from farm to farm to thresh the wheat.  That is the threshing machine would come into a farm and then there was a lot of different jobs that had to be done to thresh wheat.  First you had to bring the wheat in from the field, you had to feed it into the threshing machine, you had to gather it into the bags and you had to take it to the storage area.  So it's a job that no one farmer could do himself so four or five farmers would get together and they would go from farm to farm with their wagons and their horses and their tractors to do this operation.  So it was an opportunity to interact with other farmers and to socialize, get to know other farmers in the community so that was sort of an enjoyable thing to share that experience.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you have a dog?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had two or three dogs around the house and none of them was a particular favorite but they kept animals away and we'd go hunting with them in the hunting season of the year.  They would stay under the house.  These farm houses were up on rocks or pillars so there was an area under the house that dogs could stay under.
Speaker 1: So they would, yeah that--
Speaker 2: So they were important animals but they didn't do very much other than eat your biscuits and run around and keep wild animals away.  Well that was important.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Do you have any animal stories from those days or any agricultural stories?  I know a lot of times on a farm, sitting on the porch, people tell stories about strange things that happened on the farm and animals that did weird things or crops that, you know that came out differently.
Speaker 2: No, there wasn't anything unusual that I can recall on the farm other than just the work experience from day to day and things went pretty well.  I don't think we had any real disasters, no collapse of buildings.  No one was injured that I can recall so it was a fairly normal farm experience.
Speaker 1: Was there a job--well you said tobacco was your least favorite job.
Speaker 2: My least favorite job was raising tobacco, that's right.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite job?
Speaker 2: Well threshing wheat time I would say was my favorite job because a lot of people were involved and you'd meet a lot of different personalities.  And it's interesting the people that you meet, all of them had different personalities.  Some were very humorous story tellers, some were a little laid back, some were probably slackers so you get to know the various personalities on the--in the communities around you.  So I guess that would be probably my favorite time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You hear stories I guess.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  Yes, some of them were very colorful.
Story_ID: 22468
Speaker 1: Now did your family stay in touch with the news, what was going on?  Did you get newspapers and--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we got the newspaper from the local county [Powhatan County, Virginia].  Of course the newspaper that I get from the county now is not as newsworthy as it was twenty or thirty years ago.  The county has changed.  When I grew up in Powhatan County there were 5,000 residents, 50 percent were African American.  Now the county is--and everyone, nearly every household had a farming operation or had livestock or raised gardens or had an orchard.  Now Powhatan County is pretty much a suburban county of the city of Richmond [Virginia].  There are very few farms left.  I don't know if anyone raises tobacco.  I think there may be one or two dairy farmers left but now it's a suburban area.  The nature, the demographics has changed.  I would expect that probably the population of Powhatan now maybe 10, maybe 20 percent African American.  So the whole nature of the county has changed.  People who are moving in, many now I would not know so if there's an article in the paper I probably wouldn't recognize who the new people are.  There, sometimes there will be an article about someone that I would know so the whole county has changed, the demographics has changed, the nature of the occupations have changed so it's quite a different county.  But I do keep up with the news.  And my wife and I did purchase a farm house where the family owns and since I retired we've been renovating it and restoring some of the other buildings.  So we go down at least once a month to look after the place.  I have cousins who live there so they keep an eye on the property for me when I'm not there.  So--but anyway, we enjoy the experience.  We still have relatives.  My wife has relatives there because she and I went to the same high school so she still has family there so we have a reason to go and keep in touch with the community.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But things have really changed though.  The demographic was--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --50 percent black and now it's mostly suburban.
Speaker 2: That's right.  The community that I grew up in, the Macon [Virginia] community, there are--nearly all of the land was owned by African Americans.  There were only two white families on the road that I lived on, the Worshams and the Heaths.  Now on Worsham Road, it's completely changed.  There are probably only three or four African American families.  Now the entire community is pretty much white families.  They're all very fine families.  It was just the nature of the community has changed.
Story_ID: 22469
Speaker 1: Now in the outline here it says that race relations were very practical in terms of white and black cooperation around projects [in Powhatan County, Virginia].
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, everybody had to work together.  Everybody had to work together to get things done.  You remember how I mentioned to you when the wheat threshing time came, everybody had to get together and do the jobs and the chores necessary to bring the crop in for harvesting and threshing and black and white families worked together.  That just was the nature of what had to be done.  I didn't sense that there was any tension between the white and black families in the community.  They all understood each other and the traditions and no one really challenged it until the integration court came, decision came [Brown vs. Board of Education, 1954] along and then some of the tensions began to express themselves through the families deciding they weren't going to send their children to school with black families, that thing and a new school was established.  But the greatest resistance to integrating the schools occurred in the Prince Edward County [Virginia] which was a couple of counties up beyond us where the schools, the black schools actually were closed.  In Powhatan County the black schools were not closed.  They still operated and gradually the integration of these systems came together.
Speaker 1: Now I, from what I understand the black and white farmers would get together with their families at this threshing time and people would actually eat together.
Speaker 2: They ate together, not necessarily at the same table.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: That's interesting.  See, the gentleman who had the threshing machine was Mr. Whitlock.  Mr. Joe Whitlock was a white merchant who owned a store and a sawmill, mechanical shop, so he had a lot of facilities that the community needed.  So at threshing time Mr. Whitlock would bring his threshing machine around to the various farms and when it came time to eat Mr. Whitlock was given a separate table where he could sit, probably in the same room but a little table to himself and the others were, the African American farmers would eat at the big table.  So it was a sort of a, some separation as far as the time when the meal-time came at lunch time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you all never really ate together but in the same room but--?
Speaker 2: In the same room but not at the same table.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Isn't that interesting?  (Laughter)
Speaker 1: Okay.  So during this time period would whole families come together or just the workers?
Speaker 2: Just the workers.
Speaker 1: Just the workers.
Speaker 2: Just the workers, the people who were working in the field.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So--
Speaker 2: Yeah, not whole families.
Speaker 1: --not the family, all the whole family would come.  All right so now did you get like other newspapers, some of the black papers at home like the--?
Speaker 2: The 'Afro-American' newspaper was the primary paper we got in Powhatan where we kept up with the African American news.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Yeah I wondered--yeah, so--
Speaker 2: And magazines like 'Ebony', we would get the 'Ebony' magazine, 'African', 'Afro-American' newspaper which was published, I guess was published in Baltimore [Maryland] and Richmond [Virginia].
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 22470
Speaker 1: Okay, so okay now middle school you go to the, to a newer school I mean this new school downtown right in the, or in the town?
Speaker 2: In the courthouse area [Macon, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Court--
Speaker 2: The middle school at the county fair building.
Speaker 1: So this is--
Speaker 2: And at the middle school they did have separate teachers for each grade whereas my grandmother [Fannie Finney] taught at an elementary school where you had one through sixth grade in one room.  In the middle school you had a separate teacher for each grade so that was very helpful.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You--your grandmother had a stroke when you were ten I think?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she had a stroke in 1947.
Speaker 1: Is that when?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was ten years old.  My uncle, her son Emery, my uncle apparently drove by the school for some reason and he saw her standing at the window when he went by.  When he came back by the school she was still standing at the window and he sensed that something was wrong.  So apparently he went into the school and found out that she was suffering some kind of illness so he took her home and the doctor came and by that time she had had a stroke and she was unable to walk or talk after that stroke.
Speaker 1: So she never recovered?
Speaker 2: Never recovered.  She was bedridden from 1947 till she died, three years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I, as I mentioned earlier one of her daughters came to look after her so that was a big help.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So you had, you were taught by her, your aunt there towards the end, right?  I mean the end of elementary school I guess.
Speaker 2: I had--
Speaker 1: Or was that the end of--?
Speaker 2: I had finished my grades at the school before my aunt came to teach.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And so I had finished--I started in '43 [1943] so the year that she had a stroke I had gone to the other school down at the courthouse so I wasn't there when she had the stroke.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22471
Speaker 1: When did you get your first I guess science instruction or--?
Speaker 2: My first science instruction was in high school and that was in, when I went to the ninth grade.  When--in the eighth grade--in high school there were grades eight through twelve and eighth grade I only had one teacher.  She taught all of the courses for eighth grade.  We didn't go from room to room to different teachers.  And by the way my eighth grade teacher was also married to my cousin.  There are a lot of teachers in my education who were family members so--and I didn't get science classes until we went to the ninth grade where we had English in one class and then science in another room and then math in another room and you'd go from teacher to teacher for the different classes.  So that's the first time I had--ninth grade was the first time I got the science classes in high school.
Speaker 1: It would seem to me now and correct me if I'm wrong that you would have a--be fairly prepared for scientific work having been such a, you know, being so involved in farm work.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: It's so regulated and so precise.
Speaker 2: I think that was helpful.  I think that was helpful in terms of understanding nature, biology and some of the science activities that you later have exposure to in school.  Farming as you say is a very diverse type of occupation.  There's a lot of different things has to be done.  It's the biology of growing plants it's the animal care and their process of growing and developing.  It's the process of mechanical things working with equipment, mechanical devices, building things that you do on the farm as carpenter type of work.  So you have a variety of experiences that I think helps, is very helpful when you begin to get science classes.  Yes, I think that's right.
Story_ID: 22472
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was going to ask if your cousins helped on the farm [in Macon, Virginia] when you were growing up to--the ones that lived with you?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  Yes, they were very busy and active as I was.  They were older than I so they could do more advanced things than I could do.  Now when I grew up on the farm we had horses initially.  My dad [Essex Eugene Finney], we had two horses, sometimes three so all of the work that we did was labor intensive.  I--my dad, all day long he would walk behind a horse plowing a field or cultivating corn.  Whatever was done was done with horses so my father was very strong.  He was very, very physically active.  When I think about it now I say, "Gee, I don't know if I could do that."  One of the things, one of the great things that happened to me when I was growing up was that we got a tractor.  One of the first African American farmers in my community to get a tractor was a neighbor by the name of John Hicks, Johnny Hicks.  He got his first tractor which was a Ford, 8N Ford tractor that had rubber tires which means you can run it over the highway.  It had a hydraulic lift, you could lift things up and move it around.  Johnny Hicks got a tractor and he couldn't operate it so I was asked to operate his tractor.  So in the evenings after school I would go over to his place and I would plow his fields or disc his fields or do whatever needs to be done.  After I did his work, he would allow me to bring the tractor over to my, our farm and I could do work on our farm.  We ultimately got a tractor for ourselves but the great thing that I appreciated about growing up was the use of a tractor.  When you got a tractor that means you did not have to walk behind a horse all day long, you could ride.  Not only could you ride but with a tractor you could do four times as much work as you could do with a horse.  For example with a horse you had one plow put in, but a tractor you have a double plow.  With a horse you go down one side of the field with a cultivator and cultivate one side of the row and come back on the other side, you've cultivated one row.  With a tractor it has a, what they call a dual cultivator, two cultivators.  You could take one trip down the field and do two rows, come back on the other, you've done four rows.  With a horse you would have done one row.  Now to me that was impressive, riding and doing more work and that is one of the reasons that I decided to become an agricultural engineer, to study engineering because my goal was to improve the mechanical equipment that is used for farming to make it more labor efficient and quicker to get things done.  So that was one great achievement for me was when we were able to use a tractor instead of horses to do our farm work, plant corn, plant wheat, harvest.  I mentioned when we used to harvest wheat, you have a binder that you go down with the horses and you cut it and the binder would bind these wheat together and then you have to stack it up in the field.  When you got equipment like a tractor and mechanical equipment, you could do a combine.  A combine will go down the field, cut the wheat and thresh it.  One person could do as much work as I don't know how many people would it take with a threshing machine, four or five farmers with their helpers and the--so it's a great thing.  And so I guess that was the most, that was probably the greatest achievement that I experienced on the farm was when we made the transition from animal agriculture to farm equipment and tractors.
Speaker 1: About how old were you when that transition was made?
Speaker 2: Let's see, I was about twelve years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: By the way, I started driving a car when I was twelve and I didn't have a driver's license.  So things are quite different in those days out in the country.
Story_ID: 22473
Speaker 1: At Pocahontas High School [Powhatan, Virginia], now was there an emphasis on agriculture when you were in--?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, in high school as I mentioned nearly every family had a farm or did farming or was involved in farming.  So in high school one of the classes that all of the men, all of the boys were required to take was called vocational agriculture which gave you training in growing crops and caring for animals in terms of using equipment that you need to use on a farm like carpenter equipment, welding equipment for welding metal, electrical training in terms of repairing electrical wiring.  So vocational agriculture gave you training in all of those areas so yes that was a required course for all the young men who finished high school.  And I can add that my cousin Edward Finney was the vocational agricultural teacher.  So here again family--I felt a little embarrassed so many family members were teaching in the school system and I think some of the students said, "Well, you're getting favorite treatment," but I don't think that was true.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So now you were in school with--well I don't know if you met but two of our other HistoryMakers just recently.
Speaker 2: Yes, you--
Speaker 1: Demetrius Venable.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And was he in school with you or was--?
Speaker 2: He was younger than I and I had finished high school before he came into high school.  So I did not know him personally but I knew of him and of course Demetrius Venable's father, Mr. James Venable was the--was one of my teachers in high school and he taught me, he taught math, algebra and I think he also taught world history so he taught a number of different courses.  But yes, Mr. James Venable was a very highly regarded high school teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was married to one of my cousins.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I shouldn't mention these things.
Speaker 1: Did you know Lillian Lincoln Lambert?
Speaker 2: Lillian Lincoln Lambert, she was Lillian Hobson when she was in school.  Again, she was behind me in high school.  She came along later so she wasn't in high school when I was there.  But Lillian Hobson Lincoln Lambert had a very interesting history and I believe you have interviewed her or will interview her.
Speaker 1: We did, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but she's a fascinating individual and we greatly admire her.
Speaker 1: I think the first black woman to get an MBA [Master's in Business Administration] from Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Harvard University, yeah.
Speaker 1: And Demetrius Venable--
Speaker 2: And she's written a book about her experience.
Speaker 1: Right.  So I just thought I'd mention them.  Who were some of your other classmates and now were you considered a student leader when you were in high school?
Speaker 2: I was not the president of our class and I didn't hold an officer's position in our class.  Our president was Howard Cooper who is a minister and happened to be the pastor of Pine Hill Baptist Church now.  The only leadership position that I had in high school that I recall was I was the president of a national organization called the New Farmers of America.  New Farmers of America were students who had taken vocational agriculture in high school and there were various chapters of this organization in nearly every high school in the county.  So I was elected president of the New Farmers of America my senior year in high school for the New Farmers of America.  New Farmers of America was an organization for the African American students.  The comparable organization for the white students was the Future Farmers of America which are still active and of course the African American students and the white students now are members of both of the Future Farmers of America.  New Farmers of America doesn't exist anymore.
Speaker 1: Like the National Bar Association--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --was an association of black lawyers because they couldn't be admitted to the American Bar Association.
Speaker 2: That's exactly right, yes.
Speaker 1: So it's the same thing--
Speaker 2: Same thing.
Speaker 1: --a product of the same (unclear).
Speaker 2: The New Farmers of America I believe was founded by Carter G. Woodson, was the founder of the New Founders of America.
Speaker 1: I didn't know that.
Speaker 2: Carter G. Woodson was a--grew up in Buckingham County [Virginia] which was another county up the road from Powhatan.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's founded by the father of Negro history?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Father of black history, okay.  So now did you have much time for extracurricular activities when you were in school with the farm and the--?
Speaker 2: Primarily softball and football, basketball, those were the things.  I think I also may have participated in the drama club, plays that we'd have in school.  I also was the one who, I don't know once a month we would have a movie shown in the auditorium of the high school and the principal asked me to set up the movie projector and I would show the movies every month or whenever we had them.  So those were things I was involved in.
Story_ID: 22474
Speaker 1: Pocahontas High School [Powhatan, Virginia] and you graduated in 1954.  Now you knew you were going to college I guess at this point.
Speaker 2: Yes.  My cousin who was the vocational agricultural teacher, Edward Finney, Edward Finney was what you might call a mentor in addition to being a teacher and a cousin.  He sort of advised me.  He was a supporter and he would go the extra mile to encourage me to proceed to get a college education.  Edward Finney graduated from Virginia State College [University, Petersburg, Virginia], got a degree in agricultural education.  His sister was married to Reuben R. McDaniel who was the dean of arts and sciences at Virginia State [College] and so he had the contacts there to sort of help me get admitted, get enrolled and I also able to get a job working in the cafeteria to help pay my expenses there.  So Edward probably was the one who was most responsible for me going to college.  Now I expect that I probably would have gone even if he had not taken this role because my aunt, Novella [Finney/Ambrose] who taught school and I think, I know my mother wanted me to go to college.  But I think Edward was able to make it easier for me to make that transition from high school into college.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, and you chose Virginia State because of the connections I guess and that it's in the state--
Speaker 2: Well I chose Virginia State for two reasons; the connection but also Virginia State was the college that offered training in agriculture.  There were no other schools in the State of Virginia other than Virginia Tech, VPI [Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia], that offered training in agriculture and I was interested in pursuing a career in agriculture.  Now Virginia State did not have a program in agricultural engineering but it was my intent to go to Virginia State for a couple of years and to seek a transfer to a college that would offer training and a degree in agricultural engineering.  So I went to Virginia State primarily to get the basic training in science and math and whatever you would do normally in a two-year program and so I was able to do that.  And in the meantime I was able to get accepted into Virginia Polytechnic Institute or Virginia Tech.
Story_ID: 22475
Speaker 1: Now shortly after you I guess arrived at Virginia State [College, Petersburg, Virginia] your mother [Etta Burton] passed, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.  My--yeah, my mother passed.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, I imagine it was tough being in school when that happened.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother used to suffer from migraine headaches and apparently she had an aneurysm.  A blood vessel broke in her brain and she went to the hospital and it was too late to save her so she died in September [1954].  So that was a difficult time.
Speaker 1: Right, just at the beginning of school.
Story_ID: 22476
Speaker 1: So were there special teachers there at Virginia State [College, Petersburg, Virginia] that--?
Speaker 2: At Virginia State?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that were like mentors to you?
Speaker 2: I don't know if they were special but they were good teachers and I think that I did benefit quite a bit from Reuben McDaniel, Dr. McDaniel who was married to one of my cousins.  Nannie McDaniel was the sister to Edward Finney who had taught vocational agriculture [at Pocohontas High School, Powhatan, Virginia].  Dr. McDaniel was the dean of arts and sciences and his specialty was mathematics.  So if you're going to be an engineer you do have to have a strong background in mathematics.  So when I was having questions or difficulties with math, I would go over to his house in the evenings and he would tutor me in math.  And I think the course that I needed most help with was calculus.  And so he was very clear and very thorough in terms of explaining the background, the theory and interpreting what these formulas meant so that was probably the most important thing for me in terms of getting a degree in engineering.  In fact, when I went to Virginia Tech [Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia],  and we'll get into that later, they required me to repeat calculus and differential equations.  Well I had already had it at Virginia State and when the teacher was teaching it I knew what he was going to teach before he had taught it.  I made all As and I'm sure they wondered how in the world this student coming from a small school in Powhatan did so well in math, well it's because Dr. McDaniel had given me tutoring and instruction that prepared me for it.
Speaker 1: So they assumed that you would be remedial and--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that I would have to go through it and re-learn it again at Blacksburg.  You don't know, you probably don't know much about math so here, you'll repeat it here.  So anyway that worked well.  In fact a number of the courses that I took at Blacksburg I had already taken at Virginia State and they were easy.  In fact, I'm sure that's why I was able to be successful with finishing a lot of those courses.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22477
Speaker 1: So you were at Virginia State [College, Petersburg, Virginia] for two years right?
Speaker 2: At Virginia State from '54 [1954] to '56 [1956], that's right.
Speaker 1: Now did you--Virginia State's the black college in Petersburg right outside of Richmond [Virginia].
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Did you get involved much in the social life of the campus, did you join a fraternity or anything?
Speaker 2: Well yeah to the extent that I could.  Of course as I mentioned to you earlier I did work in the cafeteria so I had to go to work early in the cafeteria and then after the meals were over I had to stay and mop the floors and clean the tables so that cut into my time.  But I did find time to join the fraternity, the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity.  I believe I joined that the second year just before I left in 1955 or '56 [1956], but I did join that fraternity.  I also was a member of what they call the Persian Rifles which was sort of a military-oriented group that practiced rifle handling and I guess dexterity and I participated in the ROTC program, Reserve Officers' Training Program at Virginia State.  So I was able to participate in a number of things from a social standpoint as rather extracurricular.
Story_ID: 22478
Speaker 1: So now there is a drama here, now 1954 is when the [U.S.] Supreme Court renders its decision in Brown v. the Board of Education [ruling it unconstitutional for schools to be segregated].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, but also Virginia Polytechnic Institute which is now Virginia Tech [Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia]--
Speaker 2: Virginia Tech.
Speaker 1: --had attempted some sort of integration a couple of years before you graduated, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.  I'm not exactly sure what year it was.  It may have been '54 [1954] or '53 [1953], I'm not quite sure now what year it was but there was a student from Hampton, Virginia named Irving Peddrew [Irving Linwood Peddrew, III] was the first black student to be admitted to Virginia Tech.  Now Virginia Tech is referred to as Virginia Polytechnic Institute, sometimes VPI or Virginia Tech.  It's most commonly now referred to as Virginia Tech.  Peddrew was accepted to Virginia Tech for one reason primarily.  He wanted to pursue a degree in electrical engineering.  There were no African American colleges in Virginia that would offer a degree in engineering so on this basis Virginia Tech accepted him with the requirement that he life off camps and that he not participate in the social activities of the--of Virginia Tech at that time.  So he was the first, so at least Virginia Tech had made the first step toward accepting African American students.  Now Peddrew did not finish his program.  He stayed three years and his senior year, he left Virginia Tech.  And Peter Weinstein who wrote a history of the integration at Virginia Tech noticed that in his history he wrote that Irving Peddrew had had enough of Virginia Tech and dropped out.  So I'm not sure what having enough of Virginia Tech meant, but that was an interesting comment about him.
Speaker 1: Now what--now he was there before--he was there when you arrived, right?
Speaker 2: He was not there when I arrived.
Speaker 1: No--
Speaker 2: He had dropped out the fall--I arrived in the fall, he had dropped out after the spring of '56 [1956].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now when I went to Virginia Tech in '56 [1956] there were three other African American students there at that time.  One was Charlie Yates [Charlie Lee Yates] from Norfolk [Virginia], the other was Lindsay Cherry from Norfolk and Matthew Winston, all graduates of Booker T. Washington School in Norfolk.  So they were there and had been there two or three years before I arrived.  And they all lived off campus in the house where I stayed owned by Mrs. Janie Hogue at 306 E. Clay Street in Blacksburg.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And Ms. Hogue was--now you were the only three black students on campus?
Speaker 2: We were the only four--
Speaker 1: Oh four (unclear).
Speaker 2: --black students on campus in 1956 when I went there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 22479
Speaker 1: And so the university [Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia] set up an arrangement with Ms. [Janie] Hogue to house--?
Speaker 2: Had the arrangement with Ms. Hogue.  I received a letter when I was accepted from Virginia State [College, Petersburg, Virginia] into Blacksburg.  The letter basically said we have your grades and your report from Virginia State.  We have decided that we will be able to accept you at Virginia Tech to study agricultural engineering.  We have made arrangements for you to stay with Ms. Janie Hogue at 306 E. Clay Street.  She's a very fine lady and will give you the very best of care and you will be very happy there.  And she provides your housing, your meals and your laundry for sixty dollars a month.  So that's basically what the letter that I received from Virginia Tech accepting me into the program at Blacksburg.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Ms. Hogue was a very excellent person, very fine lady.  She was almost like a grandmother to the students.  She and her husband, her husband was William Hogue, Bill, they fed us well, they treated us well and provided a very comfortable home for the black students.
Story_ID: 22480
Speaker 1: Now how did, how was the campus [of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia] in terms of their welcome for you?
Speaker 2: I found the students and the faculty to be very welcoming.  As far as I could tell that there were no hostilities, I didn't sense any tension.  The students greeted you, interacted with you, did what they could to be helpful so there were no issues as far as I was concerned with regard to the students and the faculty.  I didn't find any of the faculty to be cold or uninterested or hostile so that was a big plus.
Speaker 1: That's almost amazing like I said now at the same time the Norfolk 17 were trying to integrate Norview High School and other high schools in Norfolk [Virginia] and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --were experiencing a horrible time.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well I think that the university faculty is probably a little more mature and they are probably a little more sensitive to the, what's going on in the world and the evolution of issues of a political nature.  So--and the students, I'm not sure why I didn't envision any hostility considering that many parents were very opposed to integrating but I didn't sense that among the students.  Now it could very well have been those students who had those views kept their distance but the students that I had interaction with, I didn't sense any hospitality or any tension of that nature.
Speaker 1: Did you ever hear any stories about what happened to [Irving] Peddrew or--?
Speaker 2: No, no, no I never heard.  I never heard Charlie, the students who were there Charlie Yates or Lindsay Cherry or--they never made any comments as to why he left.  I don't know if he was having some academic difficulties or just that he'd gotten tired of the issues or not, I'm not sure.  I never heard any comments about that. There were articles in the alumni magazine there, they interviewed him but I never heard him make any comments as to why he left.
Story_ID: 22481
Speaker 1: So were there any particular teachers at then, Virginia Polytechnic Institute [Virginia Tech; Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, Virginia] that were like mentors and guides?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was one in particular. Okay.
Speaker 1: There was a professor at Virginia Tech named J. Phillip Mason.  J. Phillip Mason was a professor of agricultural engineering who taught farm structures, that is how to design, build, operate, maintain all types of structures.  And I find him, I found him to be a real mentor.  You know you could always sense professors who are inviting or professors who are very professional and who's sort of distant.  And Phil Mason, Dr. Mason was probably one of the most supportive professors that I had at Virginia Tech and I have appreciated it and there is a scholarship in his name there which I contribute to every year.  Now the other surprise to me when I finished Virginia Tech [Virginia Polytechnic Institute/Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia] my senior year when I was getting ready to graduate, my intentions were to go into military service because I had finished ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] and had a commission.  I intended to go into military service, serve my two years and come out and work for a farm machinery company.  The last quarter that I was there, the chairman of the department of agricultural engineering, Professor Earl Swink, S-W-I-N-K, Earl Swink was the department chair.  I had never had much contact with him other than seeing him in the hall, saying hello.  He called me into his office and told me that he felt as though with my professional background and my success at Virginia Tech that I should go to graduate school and I told him well that would be a fine thing to do but I did not have the financial resources or money to go to graduate school.  He told me that he had made arrangements for me to go to Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania], that he had contacted the chairman of the department there and that they would accept me into the master's degree graduate program and that he had arranged with Professor Peikert, the chairman at Penn State for me to get a research assistanceship which would pay me $1,500, either $1,500 or $1,800 a year, $150 a month or something and that all of my tuition fees would be paid.  So all I had to do was enroll and attend classes.  So with that, I decided that I would go to graduate school.  I had no intentions of going to graduate school before that.  So this was an action by one of the professors that I had not anticipated and was surprise, a pleasant surprise.  So now there's a scholarship in his name at Virginia Tech now which I send money to each year for the Earl T. Swink Scholarship and the Phil Mason Scholarship.  So that's a, that was a great, that was a great thing.
Speaker 2: So Professor Swink was someone that you didn't even know was concerned about your--?
Speaker 1: Not at all, had no indication that he had any interest in what I was doing or what my future plans were.
Story_ID: 22482
Speaker 1: Now we'd be remiss if we didn't point out that your Aunt Novella helped pay for--
Speaker 2: Oh yes, Aunt Novella [Finney/Ambrose].  Aunt Novella who as I mentioned, she came home to teach after her mother [Finney's grandmother, Fannie Finney] had the stroke and continued to teach at Pine Hill [Elementary School, Macon, Virginia] until she got married.  And her, she married a preacher, Reverend George Ambrose who also taught over in Amelia [County, Virginia] for a year before he went into military service.  But Aunt Novella sent Mrs. Janie Hogue [Janie and William Hogue provided room and board for African American students who attended Virginia Polytechnic Institute/Virginia Tech soon after integration; 1950s] sixty dollars every month to pay my living expenses at Blacksburg [Virginia; Finney attended Virginia Polytechnic Institute/Virginia Tech].  So what else is there to say?  And she paid--if I needed money for tuition she sent that $160.00 for tuition every quarter.  So how more blessed can you be?  That was great and I greatly appreciate it.
Story_ID: 22483
Speaker 1: Now let me mention again with regard to mentors, I mentioned [J.] Phil [Phillip] Mason being a mentor at Virginia Tech [Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Blacksburg, Virginia] and Professor [Earl] Swink giving me a surprise by sending me to graduate school.  I do want to mention also Edward Finney [Finney's cousin and high school vocational teacher at Pocahontas High School, Powhatan, Virginia] again.  I mentioned that he was a mentor.  He was influential to me going to Virginia State.  When I received the letter from Virginia Tech to--I had been accepted, Edward was also the person who drove me up to Blacksburg to meet the dean, meet the department chairman, to tour the campus and to meet Ms. [Janie] Hogue [who provided room and board to Finney and other African American students at Virginia Tech] and make arrangements there so here again, Edward Finney, a mentor which was important in my life.  And I, when I got this notice from Professor Swink about going to Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania], here again Edward Finney took me up to Penn State to make the tour and meet the department chairman and make arrangements with housing there.  So again I want to acknowledge him and his outstanding role in helping me through my career.
Story_ID: 22484
Speaker 1: Now you got your bachelors of science [degree] from Virginia Tech [Blacksburg, Virginia] in 1959, right?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: and what was it called, a Bachelors in Science in Agricultural Engineering?
Speaker 2: A Bachelor of Science in Agricultural Engineering.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: With honors.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And I'm sure that with honors is because Dr. McDaniels helped me get my math course and some of my science courses done so that I could make As at VPI [Virginia Polytechnic Institute/Virginia Tech].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So all right, so start at Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania].  Now this is one of the odd things about you know this period of time that they, the state of Virginia actually paid your tuition to Penn State, right?
Speaker 2: Well I'm not sure, they very well may have.  I know they paid it when I went to Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan] but in my mind I don't remember now the Penn State experience.  But I know Virginia, the state of Virginia had a program to send graduate students who wanted to pursue a degree, they would pay the tuition for out of state students to go to these colleges.  That may have been true at Penn State too but I know it was true at Michigan State.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm sorry because I suppose Penn State, your financial situation as actually covered by--
Speaker 2: Yeah by the assistantship.
Speaker 1: Yeah, by the assistantship.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, so they may not have paid it for Penn State.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it got them off the hook but that sounds like one of the craziest practices I've ever heard of you know but--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --a lot of the southern states, Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina, they all did the same thing.
Speaker 2: Did the same thing?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I didn't know the other states, I know Virginia did, yes.
Speaker 1: And they'd rather pay you to--
Speaker 2: Pay you to leave their state to go to school and not to interact with their students in the historically white colleges.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 22485
Speaker 1: So what was Penn State [Pennsylvania State University] like?  Now you're up in State College, Pennsylvania.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and when I graduated from Virginia Tech [Virginia Polytechnic Institute (VPI), Blacksburg, Virginia], the first thing I did was get married.  I got married in June [1959] and we'll probably come back to that later.
Speaker 1: Now you met your wife in high school [Pocahontas High School, Powhatan, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: High school.  My wife is Rosa Ellen Bradley which she prefers to be called Ellen.  We were high school classmates and so we had struck up a relationship.  She went to school at Virginia Union University in Richmond, Virginia and got her bachelors degree in elementary education and became a teacher.  I went to Virginia State [College, Petersburg, Virginia] and then VPI and then when I finished VPI, we got married in June of '59 [1959].  So after we got married we packed up our meager belongings and drove up to State College, Pennsylvania where I enrolled at Penn State in the agricultural engineering master's degree program.  So my wife, initially my wife stayed in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] with her sister and then when I got housing she moved up to State College, Pennsylvania and she began working as a technician in the ionosphere research laboratory in the electrical engineering department which helped supplement our income.  So with my research assistantship and her work, we were able to get along fairly well financially.
Story_ID: 22486
Speaker 1: At Virginia--at Penn State [University, State College, Pennsylvania], I started my degree program [master's degree in agricultural engineering] and I worked in the area of drying cereal grains.  That was my research project when I was at Penn State, improving the efficiency of grain drying.  And I took the coursework there at Penn State and Professor [Frank] Peikert was the chairman of the department.  He gave me advice and direction and helped me with my setting up my program.  My major professor at Penn State was Joseph D. Hovenician (sp), I don't know how to--don't ask me how to spell the name, who was a professor there and he left in the first year.  And then I had another major professor, Nuri Mohsenin, M-O-H-S-E-N-I-N who's from Iran.  Dr. Mohsenin was an excellent major professor and guider.  So I was able to complete my degree there at Penn State in eighteen months.
Story_ID: 22487
Speaker 1: Now was it a possibility for you to complete your Ph.D. at Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania] too?
Speaker 2: That, Penn State did not over a Ph.D. degree in agricultural engineering at the time.  When I finished at Penn State, when I finished my coursework and my research program [master's degree in agricultural engineering], Dr. Peikert, Frank Peikert, P-E-I-K-E-R-T was the department chair.  Frank Peikert came to Penn State from Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan].  He had been a professor at Michigan State before he came to Penn State and he again encouraged me to go to get my Ph.D.  And so Frank Peikert had gotten in touch with Professor Ferrell who was the chairman of the ag-engineering [agricultural engineering] department at Michigan State and had made arrangements for me to be accepted there.  He also had made arrangements for me to have a research assistantship at Michigan State so everything was in place then for me to make the change and go ahead and pursue a Ph.D. degree.  I had no intention of getting a doctorate degree when I started school so I guess things just sort of happen sometimes.  The Lord is looking out for you, put things in place and blessed me to--cleared the path for me to go on and get a Ph.D. degree.  I went to Michigan State.  I started in the summer of 1961, I believe.  No, I, I started in February of '61 [1961] because I finished Penn State in December of 1960 because I had to go through the fall semester at Penn State.  So in the spring of '61 [1961] I went to Michigan State and started my Ph.D. program there and my major professor at Michigan State was a young, aggressive, growing, well respected professor whose name was Carl W. Hall, C-A-R-L W. Hall.  Professor Hall was probably one of the fastest professors to advance from assistant professor to full professor.  He was a progressive publisher, writing books and research articles and advising graduate students and he was the prize graduate advisor if you could get him to be your advisor, so I started under Carl Hall at Michigan State.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is East Lansing, Michigan.
Speaker 2: East Lansing, Michigan.
Story_ID: 22488
Speaker 1: Now your project for your Ph.D. [at Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] was on the viscoelastic behavior of the potato.
Speaker 2: Yes, and at that time mechanical harvesting of fruits and vegetables was a growing area and one of the problems with the mechanical harvesting of fruits and vegetables is that the mechanical devices tend to bruise, injure and damage products. It's not like handling with your hands which are very soft.  You get metal parts and hard objects that strike and do damage to products.  So one of the products--, one of the problems that I was asked to address was to evaluate the ability of potatoes and other products to resist mechanical damage so I had a project dealing with how do biological tissues behave, how do they compress, how do they become injured, how much force can they accept before they are damaged?  So this project that I was working on dealt with that.  It has a very sophisticated name, viscoelastic properties but I suppose when you do a Ph.D. degree, you're supposed to use highly technical terminology, not--so anyway that's the title of the project that I was working on.  So Professor Hall worked with me on developing ways of testing and evaluating and measuring the ability of projects to resist damage during handling.
Story_ID: 22489
Speaker 1: So was there any obstacles in your way to you know earning your Ph.D. [at Michigan State University's Department of Agricultural Engineering]?  Was there any time where you thought well maybe I'm not--?
Speaker 2: No, no things seemed to go on extremely well.  I was able to handle the graduate classes well.  My research program progressed the way that I had hoped it would.  I didn't run into any roadblocks or technical issues that I felt was going to discourage me from completing that program.  So no, I think it went very well.  I had very good professors and very good advisors and you have a graduate, research graduate committee.  The professors that served on that committee were very helpful to me when I had issues that I needed to get advice on.  So I was very pleased.  I had a great experience at Michigan State.
Story_ID: 22490
Speaker 1: So when you graduated you were going to the military, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I had my final exam for my thesis with the graduate committee [Ph.D. degree in agricultural engineering at Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] in August the 21st--, August 20th or August 21st of 1963 and in addition to completing my graduate degree, my wife [Rosa Ellen Bradley] gave birth to my first child on midnight of August the 21st, which is after I completed my graduate program.  So from there I went to military service and I had a military deferment from serving in the military while I was pursuing a graduate program.  So when I completed my degree I was obligated to enter into the military service and I was--had been promoted from second lieutenant to first lieutenant while I was at graduate school.  So I went into military service and I served in the Transportation Corp.  So my first two months of military service was at Fort Eustis, Virginia where I was also the chairman or the president of a class of students who were there at that time.  So I was there for two months and upon completing my basic training, I was assigned to Rocky Mountain Arsenal in Denver, Colorado and I was assigned to a special project there to be the chief of the administrative branch of this special project which was classified at the time.  So my wife and I and two month old baby boy packed up a U-Haul trailer and a Chevrolet and got on the road to drive out to Colorado which was a two-day trip.  So that went well.  We arrived and by the way, in November of 2000--November of 1963, while we were on our way to Colorado, President [John F.] Kennedy was assassinated.  And so as we made the trip we followed the assassination and the reports and also Levy Harvey--Lee Harvey Oswald was assassinated.  So during that trip there was a lot going on and of course we were concerned with what was going on in the country.  But we arrived at Rocky Mountain Arsenal and I began my two year tour in the military service in Denver, Colorado.
Speaker 1: Okay, now--
Speaker 2: While at Denver they--by the way, when I was at Denver the commanding officer at Rocky Mountain Arsenal was also a graduate of VPI [Virginia Polytechnic Institute], Virginia Tech [Blacksburg, Virginia], and so we were able to strike up an interesting relationship while I was there.  So, while I was in the military service I did not fire a shot, I didn't get shot at.  I was fortunate that I had an administrative position at an arsenal where we were working on some special projects.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have to do, did you get a chance to do anything related to agriculture at all or--?
Speaker 2: Yes.  The project, the special project that we were related to did in fact deal with agriculture.  And as you probably are aware, the military has programs to deal with biological agents for denying the enemy their food supply.  So the project at Rocky Mountain Arsenal was a classified project dealing with this type of issue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now there was a colonel there I think that you mentioned, Colonel William Tisdale?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Colonel William Tisdale was the director of the special project and I think the one thing I learned from Colonel Tisdale that has been very helpful to me in my career was management, the techniques, the process and the way that you handle multiple projects at one time.  And one of the things that he was very strong on was using what he called the PERT technique, performance, evaluation and review technique.  He'd have this big chart on the wall and he'd have all of the projects that we were involved in and he would have a time frame and you could charge and keep track of where each project was, who was responsible for it, is it on schedule or off schedule and coordinate the movement of equipment.  It's a very great technique which I found to be very useful throughout my career, particularly as I moved from research into management.  So Colonel Tisdale was--that was one thing that I learned from him that has been very helpful, managing multiple projects at one time.
Story_ID: 22491
Speaker 1: Now how did you I guess find out about the position or get, come to you know work for the U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA]?
Speaker 2: When I was in graduate school at Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan] and at Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania], there was a publication, a journal that came out each month called 'Agricultural Engineering'.  In that particular issue was a--each issue would have a, an article on advances in instrumentation and that was an area that I wanted to work in was instrumentation.  And so Carl Norris who was the research leader or the chief of the instrumentation research laboratory in Beltsville [Maryland] was the one who edited and published these articles each month.  So I had followed Carl Norris' career, his publications through that magazine and so when I finished at Michigan State, I knew I had to go into military service. While I was in the military service I had made contact with Carl Norris, sent him a letter and indicated I was interested in working in his lab if a position became available.  So the last year that I was there, Carl Norris wrote to me and said--sent me a letter inviting me to apply.  So I applied for a position in his laboratory and he accepted.  By the way, while I was at Rocky Mountain Arsenal [Denver, Colorado], we did have a couple of scientists from Beltsville who would come and consult and give us advice on some of our research projects so I had also made contact through the Beltsville research programs, through those scientists who had been at Beltsville.  So I was successful in getting a position at Beltsville working in the instrumentation research laboratory under Carl Norris.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So this, so now you were here, this is here, where we are today?
Speaker 2: Where we are today, yeah.
Speaker 1: In the same building or this is a--?
Speaker 2: I worked in the south building, the building adjacent to us.  On the far end of that first floor was the instrumentation research lab so I started work in the, Carl Norris' laboratory complex in the building right to the south of us.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you were basically on this site for twenty-five years, right?
Speaker 2: I started work at Beltsville in '65 [1965] and I retired from USDA in '95 [1995], thirty years and Beltsville has always been my home.  I was at Beltsville from '63 [1963] to '73 [1973] and I went away for one year when I was a mid-career fellow at Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey] for one year, came back to Beltsville.  And then in 1987, I was assigned to the North Atlantic area in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] so I went up to Philadelphia for two years then came back to Beltsville.  So basically I've been at Beltsville for thirty years.  My entire career had been here with a couple of exceptions.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now kind of walk us through what your initial assignment was and how you, you know--?
Speaker 2: At Beltsville?
Speaker 1: Yes, right.
Speaker 2: Okay, my initial assignment at Beltsville was in the instrumentation research laboratory as a research engineer.  And I was responsible for developing equipment for sorting and testing the market quality of agricultural products.  There was a division called the market quality research division, that was the division I was in and that division was concerned with once a product is developed on a farm, how do you transport it, how do you store it, how do you market it with optimum quality?  And one of the quality of products that they were concerned about was the texture.  That is, after products are harvested they tend to soften, it gets flabby and it ultimately will rot.  So I was asked to develop instrumentation for automatic sorting and testing the textural quality, the texture of products, the hardness, the firmness, the roughness.  How do these products behave in marketing channels?  So that was my project.  So I developed what they call sonic resonation, sonic resonance techniques for non-destructively measuring the texture or the hardness, the firmness of agricultural products so that was my first product that I was working on.  So that was what I involved in and I wrote a number of papers, one of which received an award from the American Society of Agricultural Engineers for the quality of the work that was done.  So that was my first responsibility at Beltsville.
Story_ID: 22492
Speaker 1: In 1970 you wrote--you published, this is an article I guess called 'Texture in Foodstuffs'.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes.  That was my--I have a whole series of articles that I had written on the testing, the instrumentation and the actual texture of food products.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Then in 1972, you want me to walk you through--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --each year or did you want me talk (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Well there's one thing here I wanted to ask about.  This is interesting.  The articled called, 'The Dynamic Elastic Properties and Sensory Quality of Apple Fruit'.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: It just seemed like something that you know we could discuss because I know about apples.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I don't know if that was--so what were you, what are you--?
Speaker 2: Well in apples, what you're interested in is the ripeness and the texture, how it eats.  That is when you first harvest a fruit from the tree it may not be fully ripe.  But when you put it in storage it will gradually soften and develop sugars and develop the best taste.  So you want to be able to measure that without cutting it because once you cut it, it's no longer marketable.  You want to be able to do it non-destructively.  So I developed a vibration technique where you can put the fruit on a vibrator and you can vibrate it and you can sense whether it's hard or soft or what it's textural characteristics is, so that's the background between, with apples.  But all fruits will do that.  All fruits have a degree of hardness and ultimately a degree of firm--peaches, pears, all of them have that.  So I did a lot of work with apples but then I also did some with some of the other fruit as well.
Speaker 1: So the change in texture indicates a change in ripeness I guess that's--?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.  Um-hmm, yeah it indicates a change in ripeness and a change in its quality it's market quality.  So it loses it's quality after you--it develops a little more after you harvest it but after a while it reaches a peak and then it will decline.  And ultimately you have to throw it away if it rots, so you want to be able to market it and consume it before it rots.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now you were saying in '72 [1972], what happened?
Speaker 2: In '72 [1972], the Agricultural Research Service [ARS]--, USDA [U.S. Department of Agriculture] has an agency called the Agricultural Research Service.  That's where I work for the Agricultural Research Service.  The Agricultural Research Service has about a hundred locations around the country and a few overseas where they conduct research on things related to agriculture.  The Agricultural Research Service in 1972 had a reorganization and they created a--Beltsville [Maryland, USDA research center] became a central center for research.  And in that center there were a number of institutes.  The institute that I was assigned to was the agricultural marketing research institute.  I think at Beltsville at the time they may have had eight or nine different institutes, plant science, animal science, market quality, entomology, all of those.  So I was appointed to be a institute director in '72 [1972] and so I was responsible for managing and directing the programs of five or six different laboratories which the instrumentation research laboratory was only one.  So this was my first step into the management arena as a scientist.  Up until that time I was involved in research and not managing any scientists or research programs.  So that's where I made a change in 1972.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I served there and manages--there was a transportational research laboratory, a food distribution research laboratory, horticultural crops laboratory, animal science laboratory and post-harvest physiology so different laboratories and you may have anywhere from five to ten research scientists in each laboratory.  So that was my responsibility in '72 [1972].
Story_ID: 22493
Speaker 1: I neglected to ask this in the beginning here but what was the racial make-up of the [U.S.] Department of Agriculture [USDA] you, I mean this research facility we got--?
Speaker 2: This research facility [USDA research center, Beltsville, Maryland]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Were you the first black person here or--?
Speaker 2: No.  No, I was not the first black person.  I know there were two or three other black scientists here before I came.  When I came here in '65 [1965]--let's talk about '72 [1972] because then it was one complex.  When I--in '72 [1972] there were 400 research scientists.  There are different grades of employees.  You have the research scientists who actually carry out the research.  You have the technicians who support the research scientists and then you have the administrative support like the secretaries, the administrators and places like that.  When I came here in '65 [1965] there were probably about 400 research scientists at Beltsville and in '72 [1972] when I 'came the director there were really about the same number.  The number of black scientists here when I came, I don't know exactly but I know there were two or three here because I got to meet them.  In '72 [1972], I believe there were about a dozen research scientists out of the 400 research scientists.  So that would be what percentage?
Speaker 1: That would be--?
Speaker 2: Well four--two or three percent, something like that.  Four hundred, one percent would be four so yeah about three, three percent would be black scientists, three or four percent.  Not near ten percent which you would normally expect it would be at least ten percent but it wasn't that number.
Speaker 1: Okay, so were there--all right, so did you--I know in the early '70s [1970s], the mid-70s [1970s], a lot of the black professional organizations formed black caucuses and black organizations within various professions to advocate for--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Black Teachers Forum, the black firefighters or--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the black police officers.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I guess from '68 [1968] through mid-70s [1970s] you had all those kind of formations.  But is there any sort of a formation here to--?
Speaker 2: There was no formal formation here at Beltsville but there was a formal formation within the [U.S.] Department of Agriculture with the headquarters downtown [Washington, District of Columbia] that advocated for improved working conditions, improved hiring, improved percentage of employees for the department but it wasn't one here at Beltsville, per se.
Story_ID: 22494
Speaker 1: Now in '73 [1973] you were a Princeton fellow [at Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --of public affairs in the Woodrow Wilson School [of Public and International Affairs, Princeton University].
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  When I became the director of the institute here in Beltsville in 1972, the director at Beltsville was Dr. Hansen, Gus Hansen, Angus Hansen.  Dr. Hansen had suggested that, I guess he felt as though I needed to improve my management skills so he arranged for me to go to Princeton to be a mid-career fellow.  There had been a couple of people from the Agricultural Research Service [ARS agency, U.S. Department of Agriculture] who had participated in this program in the past and so Dr. Hansen recommended me and I was accepted at Princeton to be a mid-career fellow in public affairs.  This is the, this is at the Woodrow Wilson School, what is called the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs.  So there, they have a program where federal employees are given training in public policy and in administrative management.  So I took courses in public policy, administrative management, the history of science and technology in the world, economics which I had not had much training in econ--microeconomics and macroeconomics.  So these are the types of things that I took while I was at Princeton and that was very beneficial.  So with my experience in management at--when I was in the military service and the training at Princeton I think gave me the qualifications that I needed to take on more responsibility.
Story_ID: 22495
Speaker 1: One of the scientists I wanted to comment about and I think is worth putting on the record is an African American scientist who was here when I came and had been here for a number of years.  His name was Malcolm Thompson.  Malcolm Thompson as far as I know is the only African American scientist who is a member of the Agricultural Research Services [ARS agency, U.S. Department of Agriculture] Hall of Fame.  The Agricultural Research Service has its hall of fame which is for the top one or two percent of the scientists in the agency.  Malcolm Thompson was trained in chemistry.  He got his early training from Xavier University [of Louisiana], in Louisiana [New Orleans, Louisiana].  He worked for a while for the National Institute of Health [NIH] and came to Beltsville [Maryland] as a research chemist working in the insect physiology laboratory which is a pioneering laboratory.  It does basic research.  And he probably is one of the top scientists, he is one of the top scientists in the agency.  He's passed away now but he did research on identifying the chemicals that are important in the life span of insects.
Speaker 2: Hmm.
Speaker 1: Now that might not sound important but it is extremely important if you want to control the insect and control the insect in a way that is not harmful to other live animals or is not harmful to plants.  So he had identified a number of chemicals that are extracted from the insect that can be used in developing insect control methods.  So I'm not going to say anymore about it but I just wanted to put him on the record as one of the top African American scientists and top scientists in the agency itself.  And he worked at Beltsville, very highly regarded.
Speaker 2: Okay yeah and this is Malcolm Thompson?
Speaker 1: Malcolm Thompson.
Story_ID: 22496
Speaker 1: Now in '77 [1977] you were appointed assistant director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Beltsville Research Center, this very center.
Speaker 2: Gus [Angus] Hansen who was the director of the research center, Gus Hansen was director from 1972 to 1979.  He was the one also influential in getting me to go to Princeton [University, Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, Princeton, New Jersey] to the mid-career program.  And so when I came back, he had a vacancy for the assistant director's position.  So I applied for it and I was accepted and so Dr. Hansen appointed me to that position in 1977.  And as the assistant director, I just assisted him in managing the programs, doing reviews or research laboratories on a periodic basis, evaluating the performance of scientists, determining priorities for new programs so that was my primary responsibility in working with him.  Dr. Hansen was a great, again a great leader and a great mentor in terms of my career.
Story_ID: 22497
Speaker 1: Now you had some interactions in the [President Jimmy] Carter administration right, with--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Or, or--?
Speaker 2: While, I guess yes while I was assistant director President Carter [James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, 39th President of the United States] was in the White House and I was asked to go down to the White House staff as a member of the science and technology staff.  It's the Office of Science and Technology Policy.  There is a science advisor to the president who provides information on technology issues, scientific issues.  And the science advisor to the president who heads the Office of Science and Technology policy has different members on his staff who bring certain expertise to the science and technology offices.  For example, there is a person who provides advice on medical issues, there is a person who provides advice on environmental quality issues and I was asked to provide advice on agricultural research and science technology issues.  So I went down to the White House in July of '79 [1979] I believe and provided the background information that they needed on agricultural research and science and technology policy.  One of the important issues that is involved in this particular responsibility is working with the office and management budget, office of management and budget on reviewing the budgets each year in terms of allocating funding for the diverse programs in science and technology, funding for National Institute of Health [NIH], funding for the National Science Foundation [NSF], funding for the Agricultural Research Agency.  So that was one of the major responsibilities I had while I was working for President Carter.  So I did this for twelve months so I worked for the last six years of President Carter and the first six years of President Reagan [Ronald Wilson Reagan, 40th President of the United States].  Now if you want to understand the difference in philosophy--
Speaker 1: You mean six months?
Speaker 2: Six months.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: What did I say?
Speaker 1: Six years.
Speaker 2: Six months.  The first six--the last six months of President Carter and the first six months of President Reagan and so there was quite a difference in the priorities and the policy and the issues that were of interest between these two presidents and you--quite naturally.  So that was an interesting learning experience for me as well as providing advice in two different areas of the administrations.
Story_ID: 22498
Speaker 1: And what was the difference in the way that the [President Jimmy] Carter administration and the [President Ronald] Reagan administration dealt with the agricultural policy?
Speaker 2: Well of course the Carter administration, Carter himself had an agricultural background.  He worked in Georgia, had a peanut farm so he was very much in tuned with agricultural programs and agricultural research.  So he was quite supportive of increased funding for agricultural research.  Of course President Reagan was not that familiar with agriculture and his science advisor was not that familiar with agriculture and so the--and of course President Reagan had campaigned on the progress of reducing the federal budget, reducing the deficit.  But in the meantime it came to be in the end that President Reagan increased the deficit more than had been for all of the other presidents combined, because President Reagan was very much oriented toward defense.  Remember, he had come forward with the idea of the--I don't remember the name of it now but--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah the Star Wars (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: Star Wars, yeah, Star Wars which required quite an investment in research and development.  So the--, President Reagan was not that strong in terms of providing funding for agricultural research.  So he had different priorities in terms of what he was interested in.  He was not interested of course too much in the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] program, was very strong on national defense and those issues whereas I don't think Carter administration was that strong on spending a lot of money on defense.
Story_ID: 22499
Speaker 1: In '88 [1988], you served as associate director of the Agricultural Research Service [ARS] and--
Speaker 2: Let's see now.  Let's follow that up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I was an assistant director at Beltsville [U.S. Department of Agriculture Research Center, Beltsville, Maryland] from '77 [1977] to 1987, I believe, 1987.  In 1987, the administrator of the agency decided to give me a new opportunity so he made--now this was the administrator of the agency overall decided to reassign a number of people to other locations.  So I was reassigned to the North Atlantic area and the area director's headquarters was in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], Pennsylvania.  So in the summer of 1987, I packed up my programs, in fact I was thinking about retiring because I wasn't interested in leaving Beltsville.  But my wife [Rosa Ellen Bradley] said, "You pack up and go on up to Philadelphia because I don't want you retiring right now."  So I went to Philadelphia and after two years in Philadelphia, I was reassigned back to Beltsville as the director of Beltsville.  But in Philadelphia, my responsibility was to assist the director for the North Atlantic area which would include all of the states from West Virginia up to, I guess we went on up to, where was we--well all of the states to the north, I was responsible for working with them.  So I worked with the director in terms of managing the programs.  It wasn't anything unusual for me and, while I was in Philadelphia but I just did what I had to do in that area.  I, I wasn't interested in going but I had to go.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But now what happened that--you became the director of the research center here in '89 [1989].
Speaker 2: In '89 [1989], so when I left Philadelphia, in 1989, Terry Kenney who was the administrator of ARS was--he resigned and under pressure.  A new director came in for the--to direct the agricultural research programs and I was then asked by the new director to come to Beltsville, to return to Beltsville as the director of Beltsville.  So I came back in '89 [1989] and at that time they were, we had a program to upgrade the research center in terms of renovating the buildings.  We had a program for renovating this building.  A lot of the research labs were renovated and I was responsible for working with the administrator in getting that done and managing the programs that were here at Beltsville.  So my career at Beltsville, I came in 1965 as a research scientist, '72 [1972] I became the director of one of the institutes, the agricultural marketing institute and '77 [1977] I became an assistant director at Beltsville and in '87 [1987] I went to Philadelphia as the associate director of the Philadelphia area and then in '89 [1989] I came to Beltsville as the director.  So that's pretty much the sequence of work that I've been involved with.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: Then the last thing I did was become the associate administrator of the agency which is the number two person responsible for all of the programs in Agricultural Research Service.  They had administrator and then associate administrator.  And I went downtown Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia] from 1989 to--no, 1991, '92 [1992] I went downtown to become the associate administrator.  I get my years mixed up here now.  But it was '80 [1980], '82 [1982] when I went downtown to Washington as the associate administrator for ARS and I retired I '95 [1995].
Speaker 1: You mean '92 [1992].
Speaker 2: '92 [1992], did I say '82 [1982]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: '92 [1992], '92 [1992] when I went downtown.
Speaker 1: Then retired in '95 [1995].  Well, I mean so did you miss doing as much I mean research I mean when you were a research director, when you were an administrator?
Speaker 2: I was fully--full time administrator.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So you didn't do any research?
Speaker 2: I wasn't doing any research.  I was managing the research programs, reviewing the programs, establishing priorities for funding programs, the normal things you would do as an administrator.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well did you enjoy administration as much as research or --?
Speaker 2: Equally.  I didn't have a preference for one or the other.  I enjoyed both of them.  I enjoyed being a researcher and I enjoyed being a manager.
Speaker 1: Okay.   I just wondered if they paid you as much to be a researcher would you rather do that and--?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.  The one thing that I think that I benefitted from, from being a manager and particularly being the assistant director and associate director was the learning experience.  When you are a research scientist, you work in sort of a limited area like when I was doing research I was working on market quality of products.  When I became the assistant director and the associate director, I went and visited research laboratories, talked to the scientists and that was a learning experience.  For example, I learned more about agricultural research when I became a manager than I did when I became a research scientist.  When I was a research scientist I was an expert in a certain area but when you become a manager and you view research you learn about entomology, you learn about plant production, you learn about animal science, you learn about human nutrition.  So it, to me being a manager was really a learning experience.  It was almost like going to school and learning information so I very much enjoyed the experience of being a manager.
Story_ID: 22500
Speaker 1: Now let me ask you this, what are some of the issues involved in agricultural research today that you've had to deal with over the last few years?  I know in Europe the mass demonstrations against cloning of foods and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And it's all, there's all these kinds of--you know people are now talking about organic food versus you know--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: I don't know.  What are some of the issues?
Speaker 2: Well there are a couple of issues as far as I'm concerned related to research science.  One of the big issues in research science is adequate funding for the scientists to do their work.  That's always an issue.  The other thing of course you just mentioned a couple of things about organic farming where the population is saying that we need less chemicals in our diet.  We need more natural products in our diet.  See, one of the things that has happened over the years as scientists develop new knowledge you know there was one time when most of our products were organic. But they have been able to develop new products that create chemicals in the diet.  You are able to get more products more efficiently and more effectively but you do use chemicals in the diet and there is great concern about how much chemistry we use in our diets.
Story_ID: 22501
Speaker 1: There is concern about citizens that some of these antibiotics that are used by cows and chickens and things, that they--, now if we eat them then we'll be to the point that we cannot retain our health because the antibiotics and that will be against our health.  So anyway, those are some of the things I think that are of concern to the scientists as well as the citizens who buy all of these products now.  So those are some of the things I guess that would be of concern by the people, all of our people now who buy this stuff.
Speaker 2: Do you have an opinion on the cloning of vegetables and that sort of thing, corn and that sort of thing?  I know they really are raising the roof in Europe but I don't know. When I look at I wonder if it's anything to be concerned about.
Speaker 1: Well, I can't say that there are reasons not to be concerned.  Sometimes these things take a long period of time before they express themselves as being of concern.  So I think we should try to the extent that we can, avoid some of these antibiotics and some of these activities.  But the scientific accomplishments that we have over the years, we have become dependent upon some of these chemicals in our production of food products and animal products and products that we eat.  So I think we have to be concerned about it and we have to be, do as much as we can to avoid trying to use these chemicals in our daily products.
Speaker 2: Is there any one substance you would want to get rid of that's used predominantly in agriculture today?  Is there any some--is there something that's really bad like DDT [dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, organochlorine insecticide] was back in the day?
Speaker 1: Well I think we have cut out using DDTs over the years and so we don't do that.  So they have other chemicals now that will, have been substitute for that, the more that we use it, the more we'll probably find out whether or not they are problems that we have and we need to do away with them as well.  But I'm not familiar with some of those now other than the DDT that they've done away with using.
Story_ID: 22502
Speaker 1: Well so you retired [from the U.S Department of Agriculture] in 1995 right?
Speaker 2: 1995, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and I have a note here that in 1999, you had a reunion with the other three black students who roomed with Ms. Janie Hogue [who provided room and board to Finney and other African American students attending Virginia Polytechnic Institute/Virginia Tech in the 1950s and early 1960s]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: In Blacksburg [Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, was she still alive then or she--?
Speaker 2: Oh no, Ms. Hogue died, she probably died during the 1960s because she had been having some health problems even when I finished in 1959.  So she died and the students then also were able to live on campus beginning in the late 1960s so there wasn't a need for living off campus.
Speaker 1: Right, I think that--yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 1999, forty years after I finished at Blacksburg, VPI [Virginia Polytechnic Institute], the black alumni had a program to bring alumni, black alums together and on that particular year we were able to have the presence of both the four black students grew up at Ms. Hogue's house, Charlie Yates and Winston, since--Winston and myself all celebrate the beating at Blacksburg.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: By the way, Charlie Yates passed away about two years ago.  He had suffered a, he had an illness and died away, died.  So Charlie Yates had a very import-, importance in Blacksburg and I think he also was a member of the staff at Blacksburg as a member of the mechanical engineering department.  And I think he had served also on the Board of Visitors at [Virginia Tech] Blacksburg at one time, one of the few blacks to be on the Board of Visitors at Blacksburg.
Story_ID: 22503
Speaker 1: Only seven percent of the research and development budget of the U.S. government was spent for agricultural research in '96 [1996]--
Speaker 2: '96 [1996].
Speaker 1: --according to this chart I have in front of me here.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Is that about right?
Speaker 2: That's about right.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: In the 1940s, about forty percent of the scientific budget was for agriculture and over--since 1940 up until the 1990s and the 1920s, the amount, the percentage of money for agricultural research has been a very small part of the research budget for agricultural research because most of the money that goes to agriculture--goes to research in science now is for the National Institute of Health [NIH] and the defense department.  The defense department has a tremendous budget for research and you can understand the importance of that for the federal government.  So agricultural research is a very small--you hardly hear anything about agricultural research when it comes to the budget it's so small.
Speaker 1: Is the--does that budget allow the department of agriculture to keep up with you know the researchers they have to keep up with, I mean to--
Speaker 2: Barely, very barely.
Speaker 1: --keep the public safe and--?
Speaker 2: I don't know if--well I can't say that it's not safe.  I would say the--it's very close and very tough for them to keep up with all of the technology that has developed over the years.  It's slowly been a problem for the [U.S.] Department of Agriculture and not only from that but also for the state Agricultural Experiment Stations along the many states, it's a real problem. Many of the ecologies of agriculture are fading in terms of agriculture.  I think the United States is very fortunate that it has such a strong agricultural research system and we are concerned that it's gradually losing the amount of funding that it needs to keep up with agriculture around the world and around the state.  But see the issue is that the United States is not suffering from food.  It has a plenty food. Nobody is suffering from food.  In fact a lot of our food is exported.  But there is a very strong shortage of food among the nations of the world, particularly in Africa and some of the Asian countries, people are starving.  But we are fortunate that we have the food and the resources for maintaining our food source and our safety of our food supply.  So I guess that's pretty much the way I see things.
Story_ID: 22504
Speaker 1: When you look back over everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well I think my legacy is that I have been blessed to have had a career where I have been a research scientist and a member of the administrative staff for the Agricultural Research Service [ARS] in the U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA].  I'm pleased that I also was able to get a Presidential Executive Reward for my research as a member of the senior executive service and USDA.  So I'm blessed and I think that I couldn't have had a better career in agriculture and agriculture research.
Story_ID: 22505
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well my first concern is the economic well-being of the African American community.  If you view and read about the African American community you read about the unemployment which is usually almost twice the unemployment rate of the white community or if you compare it with the Asian community or any other community, African community usually always short in terms of employment opportunities.  If you think about the salaries of the African American community, very short of the average for the other parts of the community in the United States.  And we just heard about the loss of the homes, the investment mortgages, how many African Americans are losing home--not only African Americans but more so probably than other demographic units so that's very sad.  And it's sad about the young people in getting an education.  The young people who are having clinical problems, it's very sad.  Just in Chicago [Illinois], how many African American young people are killing each other and it's a problem and you wonder what can be done to address that.  But it's very sad.
Story_ID: 22506
Speaker 1: When you look back over your life again, is there any major thing that you would do differently now if you could?
Speaker 2: You know fortunately I can't think of a thing that I would do differently.  I think I've been so blessed.  You know when you think about the people who have served as mentors, and how easy it was to go to college, to go to graduate school and a master's [degree], to get a Ph.D. degree, never thought I would be able to do that.  I've always admired those who have gone on and got Ph.D. degrees.  Never thought I would be able to do that.  And think about the people who stepped forward like Phil Mason and Earl Swink [at Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia] and Frank Peichart [Pennsylvania State University], all of those people and my cousins Edward Finney and Dr. McDaniels.  And I have to admit also my high school principal.  I hadn't mentioned him before, Mr. George Ransom.  You know he was a mentor and an encourager, a person who brought humor and encouragement.  So I really can't think of anything that I would have done differently.  I've been blessed.  I have a great wife, great kids so what else could I wish for?  What else can I say?
Story_ID: 22507
Speaker 1: Tell us something about your family.
Speaker 2: Well I've talked about my mother [Etta Burton] and my father [Essex Eugene Finney], my grandfather and all of those and I have a great wife.  I've told you that my wife is Rose Ellen Bradley, was a high school [at Pocahontas High School, Powhatan, Virginia] classmate.  She and I both finished high school together.  I was the, what--the number one and she was number two and we both participated in a--in one of these science question events when we went to Virginia State and students from all over the country came and answered questions that were asked.  And we, I think my wife and I came out number one and two, close to that.  So I've been blessed, my wife and I, we've had a great marriage together.  We have two great kids, my son who was born when I finished Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan], 1963, Essex Eugene Finney, III and my daughter Karen Renee Finney Shelton and grand, seven grandkids from two years old to twenty-two.  So I've been terribly blessed and they haven't gone to jail, they have good jobs and they have husband and wives who have been successful so I'm thankful to the good Lord for that.
Story_ID: 22508
Speaker 1: Well the last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh gee, how would I like to be remembered?  Well I guess I would like to be remembered as a person who was faithful to his family, that did the best that I could to be productive and helpful to the people that I've met and worked with through my life and to have a healthy life.  I've had a couple of issues that were threats to my life like I suffered from--I had treatment for colon cancer in 1999 and probably could have died and I had surgery for my--can't think of the name it now but I had surgery for my prostate in 2001 and I had a little problem there, suffering from that because my heart gave me issues.  So I've been thankful for that so I can't complain about anything.  I'm grateful to the good Lord for it.

Speaker 1: This is Pine Hill Elementary School in the Macon community [Virginia] where I grew up.  My grandmother [Fannie Finney] was the teacher.  I finished first, second, third and fourth grade here in the 1940s.  When I was in high school this is the picture of me when I was the president of the national organization known as the New Farmers of America.  I'm in my uniform there and the national meeting was in Atlanta, Georgia 1954.  This is a--four generations of Essex Eugene Finney.  From the right to the left, on the right is my dad, Essex Eugene Finney, Jr., I'm in the brown shirt, Essex E. Finney Jr., in the green shirt is my son, Essex E. Finney, III and he's holding his son Essex Eugene Finney, IV.  So this covers the period from 1912 to 2004.
Speaker 2: Right, all--almost a hundred years.
Speaker 1: This is Essex Eugene Finney, Jr. at an early age and I guess I was about four years old.  This picture was taken at the county fair.  This is Essex Finney with my mother, Etta B. Finney.  This picture also was taken at the county fair.  My mother was born 1916, died in 1954.  This is my grandmother and my grandfather on my mother's side of the family.  On the left is Janie Maston Burton and on the right is Robert Nicholas Burton a deacon at Antioch Baptist Church known as Nick Burton.  This is Robert Benjamin Burton who is the, who was a minister, a Baptist minister who grew up in the Michaux community and was the minister of Antioch Baptist Church and Shiloh Baptist Church in Powhatan County [Virginia].  This is Essex Finney with his cousin Edward [Finney].  Edward is the vocational agricultural teacher at Pocahontas High School [Powhatan, Virginia] and my mentor.  This is a picture of our class at Virginia State College in Petersburg, Virginia.  These are my classmates who studied agriculture.  I'm on the right hand side with the funny looking shirt on at the top.  This picture was taken in 1956 at Virginia State College.  This is a picture of Essex Finney at Virginia Tech.  I was a member of the Corps of Cadets and this is my year at Virginia Tech in 1956.  While I was at Virginia Tech I was required to live in a private home on--in Blacksburg, Virginia.  Ms. Janie Hogue standing on the right is the owner of the home and on the left is her husband Bill Hogue.  And I'm--this is the day I graduated from high--from Virginia Tech in my uniform.  In 1959, I married Rosa Ellen Bradley.  She prefers to be called Ellen.  So this is our graduation picture in 1959.  In 1985, I received an outstanding engineering award from the dean of engineering at Penn State.  So the dean is holding my plaque.  On the right is my wife Ellen and myself, Essex.  This is a photograph of Essex Finney when he was a Ph.D. student at Michigan State University [East Lansing, Michigan].  On the left is Professor Carl Hall who was my major professor and advisor and a former assistant director of the National Science Foundation [NSF].  This is a picture when I was in my fifth year at the Agricultural Research Service [ARS] of USDA [United States Department of Agriculture] and this picture I was given an award for one of my publications.  From left to right is Essex Finney, George Irving, the administrator of ARS [Agricultural Research Service], Carl Norris, the chief of my lab who hired me and Mr. Ed (unclear), the associate administrator of ARS.  I was also the associate administrator of ARS before I retired.  This is a picture of me when I was the associate director of the North Atlantic area of the Agricultural Research Service.  My headquarters was in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  I worked there from 1987 to 1989.  1980 to 1981, I worked for--as a member of the advisor to the science advisor to the president.  I'm shown here with President [Jimmy] Carter getting a greeting before he left office in January of 1991.
