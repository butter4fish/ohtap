Speaker 1: Let's begin talking about your mother Dr. Hicks.  Would you start with your mother's name and where your mother was born and where she grew up as a girl?
Speaker 2: My mother was Eleanor Victorine Frazier Hicks.
Speaker 1: And could you spell Frazier?
Speaker 2: F-R-A-Z-I-E-R.  She is a native also of Baton Rouge, Louisiana and grew up in the Louisiana Capital City.
Speaker 1: And did she ever share any stories with you about what life was like for her as a girl growing up in Louisiana?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sure that over a process of years my mother shared many stories about people and places in Louisiana.  And many of those stories of peoples and places I was surrounded by as a child.  Louisiana experience was a, was a rich one and one that I have not forgotten.
Story_ID: 8250
Speaker 1: Any stories that particularly come to mind? Any favorites that you have? Any stories about her [Eleanor V. Frazier Hicks] siblings, or just what life was like during that period?
Speaker 2: My mother was one of four children born to James Monroe Frazier.  James Monroe Frazier, and you must understand that this is in the late 1800s up to the middle 1900s, was by training an educator.  My grandfather actually held a doctorate in pedagogy from the University of Iowa [Iowa City, Iowa].
Speaker 1: Wow!
Speaker 2: And when I came to know my grandfather he was president of Leland College in a place called Baker, Louisiana.  Now Leland College was a, a church-related school.  It was actually funded and supported in some measure by the Old Northern Baptist Convention which today is now the American Baptist Convention.  My grandfather was president of Leland College when I was born, so my first memories of life had to do with Leland College and running about in the president's home on the college campus. The interesting thing about that is, that not only was my grandfather the president, but my mother was chairman of the English department and cashier at the cafeteria.  And my father was a dean at the chapel at, at the school.  And so I literally grew up barefoot in Louisiana and my, my fondest memories are walking through the fields that surrounded the school and being quite at liberty to go wherever I wanted to.  It was a rural area and everybody knew who I was and I could go anywhere I wanted to because I would be surrounded by surrogate parents everywhere that I went and so that's kind of the environment in which, which I grew up.
Speaker 1: How was it--did the family ever talk about or do you know how it was that your grandfather was able to go to the University of Iowa during that time?
Speaker 2: Now you've asked me a question I can't answer.  I, I have no idea.  The, the interesting thing about it is that both my, both sets of grandparents on both sides, my maternal grandparents and my paternal grandparents were all college graduates.  And when you consider the time that that occurred for them to have college degrees was absolutely unheard of.
Story_ID: 8251
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit now about your father starting with your father's name and where he grew up as a boy and where he was born?
Speaker 2: My father's name was Henry Beecher Hicks, Sr.  He was born in the state of Alabama in a little town called Uniontown, Alabama and that was in the year 1912 when he was born.  My father--you want an interesting story about my father.  Even though my father was born in Alabama, the family sort of migrated to a lot of different places because his father, William Hicks, was also a minister and he was sort of an itinerant minister who went from place to place in Alabama, Louisiana, Texas, this, that and the other.  One of the places to which he went to pastor was Shreveport, Louisiana.  And my father was a very aggressive kind of little boy and they tried to keep him at home.  And he sort of tended to wander off because he wanted to see what the world was about.  And so in order to keep him at home on one occasion his mother decided that the only way she could keep him home would be to put a dress on him, and so they put a dress on Little Henry.  He was about four or five years old.  And unfortunately there was a, a funeral in the neighborhood and as the cortege came down the street, much to my grandmother's horror, there was Henry on top of the hearse with a dress on.  So my father was always a, a rascally kind of guy and always into everything.  But as I say they made their away around various communities my, with my grandfather's pastoring.  My father as I say was dean of the chapel at Leland College and also was the pastor of a church in a place called Brulee, Louisiana.  And the, the claim to fame for Brulee was that it was the first place west of the Mississippi River where the gospel of Jesus Christ was preached.  And so my father was pastor of the church in Bruley and also principal of the high school.  In 19--around 1942, 1940--no that's incorrect.  It would have been in, around 1940, '39 [1939], '40 [1940] my father left Louisiana and went to the state of Ohio.  There he enrolled at Oberlin [College] School for Theology in Oberlin, Ohio.  And while my mother was still with my sister Sandra and with me in Louisiana, he was in school at Oberlin and sort of doing a commute.  Now you can imagine what kind of commute that was during that period of time when transportation was not exactly completely available for us, but that's what he did.  And then he also pastured the church while he was in seminary at Oberlin, a little church called the Second Baptist Church in a place called Medina, Ohio and Medina is near Cleveland if that helps to clarify it a little bit--near Cleveland, near Ashland, Ohio up in Northern Ohio.  In 1946 my father was called to become the pastor of the Mt. Olivet Baptist Church in Columbus, Ohio and he remained there as pastor of Mt. Olivet Church in Columbus, Ohio for thirty three years.  And of course we moved to Ohio when he received the call to that pastorate and from 1946 on.  And so I grew up in Columbus, going to public schools there and developing as a person in, in that city.
Story_ID: 8252
Speaker 1: How would you describe your mother [Eleanor V. Frazier Hicks]?
Speaker 2: How does anyone describe mother.  There was no one to compare with mother.  My mother was a very gentle woman and yet a very disciplined and forceful woman.  She was a woman of great character and a woman of great skill as a teacher.  She had many positions working with the city of Columbus [Ohio] but the thing for which she was remembered most is her ability to, to teach.  I suppose one of her most famous pupils was a man by the name of Les Brown.  And Les Brown will tell you today that one of the persons that shaped his life was my mother.  And so you know we called her 'Dear' and everybody, everybody loved 'Dear', and she left us too soon.
Story_ID: 8253
Speaker 1: Did you know your maternal grandmother?
Speaker 2: I did not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did not know my maternal grandmother.  However, my grandfather [James Monroe Frazier] did remarry and so I did have a grandmother on, on that side of the family.
Speaker 1: And her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Gladys Duncan Frazier and she was the only grandmother that I knew.  She, she was with him during the days of his presidency at Leland [College, Baker, Louisiana] and we called her Mama Gladys.  Interesting story about it, my grandfather, my maternal father's wife was named Gladys.  His eldest son, James Frazier, Jr. was married to Gladys and his youngest son whom we call Jake, his wife was named Gladys.
Speaker 1: So let's talk now about your paternal grandfather, your father's father.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Starting with his name.
Speaker 2: My paternal grandfather's name was William Hicks.  As far as I know he had no middle name.  He was a, a preacher.  He was not only a preacher and I told you he had graduated from college.  He was also a, an author.  He wrote a history of Louisiana Baptists that within the last ten years was rewritten and revised by a special project out of one of the universities in Louisiana to, to make sure that it would be preserved.  It was quite an interesting piece of historical work that he wrote and once again to know that he was writing at that time is really phenomenal on its face.
Speaker 1: Was it a historical representative, representation of the black church in Louisiana, black Baptists?
Speaker 2: The development of black churches in Louisiana, primarily concentrating on the Baptist faith.  My grandfather when I came to know him, we considered him to be an old man even though at the time when I look upon it now he wasn't as old as we thought he was.  But my grandfather was a character.  He--I never knew a day when my grandfather didn't wear long johns.
Speaker 1: Even during the summer?
Speaker 2: Even during summer.  You have to understand there's a theory behind wearing long johns in the summer.  I'm not sure you want to hear this.
Speaker 1: Please share, please.
Speaker 2: The reason why you wear long johns in the summer is because they cause you to perspire.  When they cause you to perspire if a breeze comes along they automatically cool you off.  But my grandfather was a very rigid kind of guy.  He had five children and his task was to spend time with all of them.  So he would go from house to house.  His wife had died.  He was no longer pastoring and so he would come to, to Bud's house and then he'd stay with Bud for three or four months and then he'd decide to go to Henry's house and stay there three or four months.  And his, his arrival was never anticipated.  We never knew when granddaddy was going to show up and his departures were always abrupt because he would always stand in the middle of the floor one morning and say well, "God tells me I need to go to Minnesota."  And the next thing you know he's off to Minnesota or some other place in, in the world, to California where his daughter may have been.  But he was just eclectic is probably a good word, a free spirit.  He, he went where he wanted to go.  He ate what he wanted to eat, drank what he wanted to drink.  He, he--now you got to understand his drinking was confined in the morning to hot water.  And he drank not coffee--.
Speaker 1: Just hot water?
Speaker 2: --mind you, not tea, hot water because hot water was good for your constitution and, at least that's what he said.
Speaker 1: (Laughs)
Story_ID: 8254
Speaker 1: How far back can you trace your ancestry?  Do you know if your people came from free people or slaves?  How far back can you trace your ancestry?
Speaker 2: Beyond William Hicks, who was the furthest back that I know of anyone what we do know is this, that my, my paternal grandfather's name was not Hicks, that the family--his father was named Square Hicks.  Square was a slave and Square's name was not Hicks, it was Curtis.  But after the Emancipation Proclamation he--because you understand the name Curtis was a slave name, it was the name of the owner.  And so they abandoned the name of Curtis and took on the name Hicks.  Now if you ask me why they took on the name Hicks, I'm lost again.  But I do--that's as far as, as I'm able to get into my ancestry.
Story_ID: 8255
Speaker 1: What is your earliest memory like what's the very first thing that you remember, like your earliest vivid memory?
Speaker 2: Oh my earliest vivid memory of life is clearly Leland College [Baker, Louisiana].  I remember the hanging moss on willow trees.  I remember the dirt road.  I can--my grandfather--you heard the story of your grandfather's Buick?  My grandfather had the Buick, and we loved that old Buick and it was, it was a car when it was really a car.  I mean if you take one of these cars today and smash into that, that car you'd have real trouble on your hands because it was made out of something.  And I could still smell the leather in that car.  I can still see the chickens that walked around the yard.  I can still taste the water because in Baton Rouge [Louisiana] now this could be the, the romanticism that comes from early childhood but I declare the water had a sweeter taste than anywhere else I know.  Now I also remember the smell of the oil refineries in Louisiana because when you came to, into Baton Rouge when we would drive back from Ohio to Baton Rouge by the time we got twenty miles outside of Baton Rouge you could smell the oil refineries and, and, and you would know where you were.  I, I remember the people.  I, I remember riding horseback with one of the students at, named Chris.  Chris was a--.
Speaker 1: At Leland College?
Speaker 2: Chris was a student at Leland College and he would pick us up and take us for horseback rides up and down the road.  I remember picking blackberries along the, the side of the road and, and getting lost and, and everybody wondering where in the world I was.  I, I remember the, the bathroom up on the second floor that had a space heater that was just this small and getting burned on my leg a scar I carry to this day.  So my memories of Louisiana and Leland are very, very vivid and very precious to me.
Speaker 1: You--another question that I'd like to ask and you've already answered a couple of them are what sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up?  So you gave us smell of the oil refineries.  What sights remind you of your childhood and of growing up?  Like when you see that it just really triggers memories of childhood?
Speaker 2: Oh, I suppose one of the things that reminds me of my childhood, how should I describe some of the houses that the people of that era lived in?  I don't know if you know what a shotgun house is?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: You can look through the front door and see all the way through to the backdoor from the front door to the back door.  And I remember going to my great grandmother's house and sitting on the back porch--not, not the back porch, didn't have a porch, it had steps and only two steps.  But we'd sit on the steps and spend our time jumping from the second step to the ground and thinking we were taking a great leap.  I, I remember the--I do have vivid memories of the smell of the houses and old folks liniment.  My grandfather's Absorbine Junior.  I don't know do they still make Absorbine Junior?  But it had an awful smell.  Oh, and by the way since we're having much fun here talking about sights and sounds, my grandfather didn't much trust indoor plumbing.  So, my grandfather always had a little pot down by the side of the bed and my task was to empty it from time to time.  Wonderful, wonderful memories of the things you did and you'd rather not do.
Speaker 1: (Laughs)

Speaker 1: Would you please give us your siblings' names in their birth order including yourself?
Speaker 2: My elder sister is Sandra Hicks Cox.  She lives in Pasadena, California and for many years was an attorney with Kaiser Permanente and is now retired from that position.  I am the second of three children.  My brother who is younger than I is Dr. William James Hicks, was named for our grandfather even though my grandfather didn't have a middle name, but is William James Hicks and he lives in Columbus, Ohio.  He is a professor of medicine at Ohio State University and is an oncologist/hematologist by training.
Story_ID: 8257
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about the community you grew up in.  Can you kind of describe it for us?  Like do you remember the name of the street that you lived on growing up?
Speaker 2: I remember every one.
Speaker 1: Which one like is the most vivid memory and can you kind of describe that street and that community, that block?
Speaker 2: My first memory of the street on which I lived was Mound Street.  The exact address was 603 East Mound Street in Columbus, Ohio.  We lived in the church parsonage.  My father was pastor as I say of the Mt. Olivet Church [Columbus, Ohio] and so we lived in the church parsonage.  And I remember the, the entry foyer, the living room off to the right, the dining room straight ahead.  My father had an office which was off to the right and then a kitchen behind, bedrooms upstairs of course.  And, and of course it had a basement with a chute for the coal to be dropped through in order that I would have something to do on winter days to put the coal in the furnace, had a large backyard and a garage in the back for my father's Dodge.  He didn't have a Buick, he had a Dodge until he got a little prosperous one day and actually bought a Packard.  But we thought we had all died and gone to heaven when he got that Packard.  It was the church parsonage on Main Street and we remembered--I remembered playing as a child on Main--on Mound Street.  There were about, well we were surrounded on either side by members of the congregation so you couldn't do anything wrong because Ms. Drubdyke (ph.) was on the right hand side and J.D. Hooper was on the other side and then there was a, a beer garden about two or three doors down the street.  The streets, the sidewalks were brick and then we had street lights and we played all kind of street games and yard games along the street with the kids in the neighborhood.  And of course in that day you had to be home by the time the street light went on.  If you didn't get home by the time the street light went on you were going to meet Jesus--and so we, we managed to do that.  It was a, it was a, it was a wonderful neighborhood in a way in, in that day and as I recall the late 40s [1940s], early 50s [1950s] strangely enough an integrated community in Columbus, Ohio, poor blacks and Jews primarily who lived in that area and some poor whites as well.  Everybody was poor.  The problem was we didn't know it and nobody ever told us that we were poor.  We were just, we were just there struggling.  The, the elementary school that I grew up in was down the street and around the corner. The, the elementary school that I grew up in was down the street and around the corner.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the school?
Speaker 2: Fulton Elementary School [Columbus, Ohio], absolutely.  And my, my first grade teacher was a woman named Ms. Roland.  And then we, we moved from that area from Mound Street from 1455 Eastwood Avenue.  We had moved then from the South side of Columbus to the east side of Columbus.  Generally it would take you all of ten minutes, but that's what we did.  And the interesting thing about that street was that it was something of a, a preacher's community.  There were several ministers who lived in the area and the interesting thing for me of course was that it was three doors away from East High School.  So I could literally roll out of bed and in ten minutes be in my homeroom because it was just three doors away.  So it was a, it was a good experience for us there on Eastwood Avenue.  It, it, it was the area I guess one could say for up and coming blacks in Columbus, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Was it still integrated or was it--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: No it was totally black.  And there I learned the value of industry.  My, one of my first jobs was as a delivery boy for the Tyler Drug Store and my job was to delivery prescriptions.  This is in a day when people could call in their prescription and then somebody would deliver it to their home.  Well I was the delivery boy and the--Tyler's Drug store gave me twenty cents for every prescription that I delivered in the neighborhood.  And I got on my trusty bicycle and made my deliveries.  That all worked until one day I was coming out of the driveway of the drug store and got smacked by a car, went sailing through the air and I, at that point my mother said she thought I'd had enough of the delivery business.
Speaker 1: Were you hurt badly?
Speaker 2: No I wasn't, strangely enough.
Story_ID: 8258
Speaker 1: You mentioned your elementary school.  Were there any other particular teachers who had an influence on you that you remember in particular from elementary school?
Speaker 2: Yes, my sixth grade teacher was a woman by the name of Ms. Palmer and that was at Fair Elementary School [Columbus, Ohio] because you remember we moved from Mound Street to Eastwood and when we moved there I had to leave my elementary school at Fulton and go over to, to Fair Elementary School, and my sixth grade teacher was Ms. Palmer.  Following my elementary time I moved to Franklin Junior High School [Columbus, Ohio]--(simultaneously).
Speaker 1: Well let's stay--I want to ask you a few more questions about elementary.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: What were some of your favorite subjects in elementary school?
Speaker 2: I don't know that I had a favorite subject in elementary school.  It was an interesting time.  As I recall I suppose the most phenomenal thing about my primary education is that it wasn't until I arrived in college that I actually had an African American teacher.
Speaker 1: That you had an African American teacher?
Speaker 2: All of my teachers were white from the time that I went to elementary school all the way through high school.  Now there, there were--that's because even though there were black teachers they, they were scattered about and not a whole lot.  Whites still had the majority of teaching slots within the school system.  And so as, as fate would have it I, I never experienced being taught by an African American until I went to college.
Speaker 1: And what kind of student were you in elementary school?
Speaker 2: Rambunctious, didn't pay much attention, had other things I wanted to do like basketball and that kind of thing so I was very typical.  It, it was--school was not a struggle for me so I went on and did what I wanted to do.
Story_ID: 8259
Speaker 1: When you were in elementary school did you have dreams and aspirations like what did you want to be when you grew up?
Speaker 2: Oh boy, I suppose I went through all of the kind of desires for growing up that all little kids had.  I was telling someone the other day that one of the things I used to do was to listen to baseball on the radio.  You--they didn't televise it so I listened to baseball on the radio.  And of course the closest thing to a baseball team that I could listen to was the Cleveland Indians and so I, I came to have great appreciation for all of the black baseball players that you could imagine, Larry Doby, Roy Campanella played for Brooklyn [Dodgers] and you, you just named a list of them.  We--those were, those were our heroes.  Those were our Michael Jordans.  They were the ones that we emulated you know.  Other kind of professional sports really didn't count.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite?  Who was your favorite?
Speaker 2: Favorite--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 1: Baseball player?
Speaker 2: Oh I, I suppose Larry Doby was one of my favorites, yeah.  He was an outfielder for the Cleveland Indians.  And, but any, anybody--Jackie Robinson of course was in that number as well and at the time you have to understand how important sports and baseball happen to be.  That's why it's important today.  I mean we've forgotten why it was important but it was important because sports is one of the few areas that blacks, once they could break into could find a way to gain respect in the world.  And so of course you wanted to be like Jackie Robinson.  You, you--my daddy preached about Jackie Robinson.  I don't know how many times he preached the story about Jackie Robinson stealing home.  Now for most folk, stealing home means nothing at all.  But for those of us who paid attention to baseball, for somebody to steal home that was really an achievement okay?  So I, I spent--I would go to sleep at night, I would fall asleep listening to the ball games.  So I did the typical things that kids of that age and era actually, actually did.
Speaker 1: Did you ever think when you were in elementary school during that time period in your life, did you ever think that you'd go out to be a minister like your, your father and grandfather?
Speaker 2: Oh no, it was the last thing I wanted to do, my God, be a preacher.  Please give me something else to do, oh lord.  But what I really--when I came to a point where I was trying to decide which way I was headed, I really decided I wanted to be an attorney and I was a high school debater and we haven't gotten to high school yet.  But I was a high school debater and I just knew that I was going to be a lawyer.  And of course my model, sad to say for, for being a lawyer was Perry Mason because you--he won all the cases. So of course, I was going to be a black Perry Mason and I, I knew that I wanted to be a criminal attorney.  And I've been far afield from that, but--.
Speaker 1: So let's talk a little bit about junior high school.  What was the name of the junior high school that you attended?
Speaker 2: Franklin Junior High School [Columbus, Ohio].
Speaker 1: And what were your experiences like in junior high school during those like tween and teen years?
Speaker 2: Well, this was the year when I came face to face with the reality that I was not going to be a sports star.
Speaker 1: What happened?
Speaker 2: Well you know that's when you begin to be a little more competitive than you are just out on the school yard at elementary school and you start trying to, to get on the, this team and then you realize you're not going to make the team, you don't make the cut.  And you know I, I came to find out that I was really not as coordinated as I needed to be in order to compete with the other folk.  And, and so I learned to do other things.  I, I discovered that I could talk and so in that talking I began to carve out a niche for myself in and among my fellow students.
Story_ID: 8260
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of your teachers from junior high school [Franklin Junior High School, Columbus, Ohio]?  Were there any who influenced you particularly?
Speaker 2: Yes, Agnes Merit was my math teacher.  Agnes Merit was about four feet tall and, and I was going to say mean, but I would say stern.  She had her own way of doing things and her favorite phrase was a 'word to the wise is sufficient' and so I remember Agnes Merit and I also remember some of her sayings.  She gave me some I've kept for the rest of my life.  It's a trilogy and I have to try to recall all of it but it was something to the effect that, 'He who knows and knows not that he knows is asleep.  Wake him.  He who knows not and knows not that he knows not is a fool.  Shun him.  He who knows and knows that he knows is wise.  Follow him." That's the kind of thing that Agnes Merit shard with us in junior high school along with, with math.  She was trying to teach us some things about life.  I, you know--it took a while before I realized what was happening to me though in that junior high school experience because I remember that one of the things we wound up in is a thing that they call shop where we had to learn how to use hammers and saws and screwdrivers and how to make tire racks and how to make napkin holders and all of that kind of thing and then mechanical arts where we had to learn how to draw straight lines and how to measure them and to gain dimensions and that kind of thing.  And I didn't realize that a part of the implication of that was that I was being shuttered into a narrow path because I wasn't supposed to do something intellectual, I was supposed to do something with my hands and not with my head.  And so as a consequence the school system was designed to make me a cripple before I'd ever had an opportunity to walk like a man.  And so I, I took--I, I'm a, I'm a frustrated carpenter today.  I, I, I think I know what to do with a hammer and a saw but you know if I tried to build anything I'd probably drown from the flood that would overtake it.  So you know, but that's, that's where we were, that's where we were put.  So that's what I remember from my junior high school experience.
Speaker 1: And who was influencing you as a young person, not necessarily at school but who was influencing you in general as a young man?
Speaker 2: Oh I, I would have to, to really give some thought to that.  You know one of the places where we got great influence was the local YMCA.  Now you have to understand in Columbus [Ohio] there, at the time we were kids there were, there were two YMCAs.  There was the YMCA that was Downtown and you know who that was for.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then there was the Spring Street YMCA and you know who that was for.  And of course the facilities and the equipment in the Downtown YMCA was far different from the faculties and the equipment in the Spring Street YMCA, but there were people in that YMCA who made a difference in our lives, who taught us things that we would not have learned otherwise.  And so I remember on Saturday mornings how many times my brother and I would get on the bus and make our way down to swim classes and one thing or another.  And I think that it was in the YMCA that I first learned a love for music, that I, I--I was in a, an all boys' choir and we learned how to sing negro spirituals and anthems and that kind of thing.  We didn't sing gospel music or that kind of thing but it was, it was--we were serious, seriously taught serious music and that made a difference in my life.  I, I know it sounds cruel but I remember Mr. Willis who was the athletic director of the YMCA.  My daddy [Henry Beecher Hicks Sr.] took me down there and told him I want him to learn how to swim.  And Mr. Willis said "Fine, come with me.  Son put on your swim suit," and, and I did and we walked back to the water.  He picked me up and threw me in the water, said swim.  Now that seems cruel doesn't it?  But I learned to swim.  I learned to survive.  I learned how to make my way to shore.  Now he taught me the skill later on, but immediately he wanted me to know something of self reliance and something of independence and not waiting on somebody to give you something, but that you had to go and earn it for yourself.

Speaker 1: Let's talk now a little bit about high school.  What was the name of the high school that you attended?
Speaker 2: Well there was only one high school in Columbus, no matter what other people tell you.  It was Columbus East High School, [Columbus, Ohio] the Mighty Tigers.
Speaker 1: What kinds of activities were you involved in, in high school?
Speaker 2: It was in high school that I, that I really began to develop my penchant toward public speech and so I was a part of, of the speech and drama club.  I, I did dramatic pieces.  You know that was in a day when they did the Rogers and Hammerstein operettas.  I was a thing to behold in the "Mikado" and I was the 'Lord High Executioner', (reciting lines from Mikado) "A personage of noble rank and title, a dignified and potent officer whose functions are particularly vital."  I was on the debate squad.  In my first year of high school, tenth grade, the Ohio Council of Churches had what they call at the time an oratorical contest and it really was a, I don't know how you would describe the competition.  They gave us a book of speeches and your task was to learn by rote one of the speeches and then you would compete with other students, some of whom would be getting the exact same speech, but who could deliver the speech in the best way.  And when I was in the tenth grade I actually won the state competition and--
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Do you remember your speech or what the speech was about or who it was written by?
Speaker 2: I don't remember who it was written by but it had to do with a candle that had been built and was placed in the United Nations.  And on one occasion something happened at the United Nations and this huge candle piece was melted to the ground.  And the speech went on to talk about how fragile world peace really is.  Well, I took all of my background, my grandfathers, my, my mothers who were teachers, my father who was a preacher, my grandfather who was a preacher, took all of my skills and resources that I have gained from others and put it in the presentation of that speech and as a result by the time I finished that speech I had, I had amassed seven scholarships to attend colleges in the state of Ohio.
Speaker 1: And this was your sophomore year?
Speaker 2: It was my sophomore year.  I hadn't finished high school and I had seven scholarships waiting for me.
Speaker 1: And do you remember how you felt when you gave that speech?  Did you feel like you know I am totally in my zone so to speak and this is what I'm destined to do?  How did you feel?  Was it like that for you or--?
Speaker 2: I don't know that I really had that kind of feeling.  I, I think I saw it as a challenge.  I saw it as an opportunity to, to express myself but I, I never thought of it as being in my zone.  I don't, I don't think my thought process had developed to that point where I would, I would begin to measure it in that kind of term.  But I just thought it was a tremendous opportunity and, and I got, I got a lot of juice from it and a lot of recognition and that fed my ego and so I kept on doing it.
Speaker 1: And so at this point in high school what are you thinking you want to do with your life when you grow up so to speak?
Speaker 2: I'm still a lawyer.  I'm still a lawyer I'm convinced of that.  And I'm, I'm using my skills--strangely enough one of the crazy things I did when I was in high school was I was the announcer for the band.  When the band went out to give their presentations at half time you know how they make their formations, I was the guy in the press box on the microphone, on the loud speaker and I'm telling everybody what the band is doing.  Everyone, nobody's paying a bit of attention to the band or to me.  Nevertheless that's, that's the kind of thing I did.
Speaker 1: And tell us a little bit about what type of young man were you in high school?  Were you shy, were you gregarious?  What type of young man were you?
Speaker 2: I don't think I ever had a shy bone in my body.  I was always gregarious, always around people.  One of the things I wanted to mention to you of that high school era but probably the most important thing that I did was my affiliation with a thing called the National Forensic League.  Now the National Forensic League still exists today in fact and it has to do with organizing young people in high school to do the kind of competition in terms of oratorical declamation, debate, original compositions that, that are given, that kind of thing.  I achieved the highest ranking that one could achieve in the National Forensic League.  Great disappointment of my life was that I never, I never qualified to go to the national competition so it was--but an interesting thing because it helped to develop me in, in many ways and not the least of which was some intellectual acuity that developed as a consequence of it.
Speaker 1: So you're still thinking you're going to be a lawyer.
Speaker 2: Still thinking I'm going to be a lawyer.
Story_ID: 8262
Speaker 1: What were some of your thoughts about college?  You wanted to be a lawyer so obviously you knew you were going to college.  Where were you thinking perhaps you'd like to go to college?
Speaker 2: Sad to say I don't think I really gave it that much thought.
Speaker 1: Not sad, I mean you know but you knew you were going to college, but couldn't--(simultaneously).
Speaker 2: I knew I would go to college but didn't give it a lot of thought.
Speaker 1: As to where you would go.
Speaker 2: And, and the, the reality of it you know young people today have such advantages.  We have advisors and counselors in school now.  We had no counselors, no one to tell us where to do or how to do it.  It was sort of on your own and, and so as a consequence it was sort of a hit and miss proposition.
Speaker 1: So how was the decision to attend the University of Arkansas [at Pine Bluff;  at that time the Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College, Pine Bluff, Arkansas], how was that decision--how did you come to that decision?
Speaker 2: Well that decision skips over a piece of my history that you won't find in my resume.
Speaker 1: Oh okay well let's, let's go to that.
Speaker 2: Remember I told you I had seven scholarships--.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --to go to college.  One of those scholarships was to a school named Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio.  So my freshman year was spent at Wittenberg University.
Speaker 1: And what year did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: In 1960.
Speaker 1: How do you spell Wittenberg?
Speaker 2: W-I-T-T-E-N-B-U-R-G (sic. Wittenberg).
Story_ID: 8263
Speaker 1: We didn't talk about your family's experiences in church and what it was like growing up as a 'PK' a preacher's kid.  What, what was that like and what were your family's experiences in church like?
Speaker 2: I think it's fair and accurate to say that the church life was our only life from early morning life until the close of the day we lived, breathed everything about the church.  It was not only my father's [Henry Beecher Hicks Sr.] profession it was the family's obsession.  My father didn't have an assistant pastor so the closest thing he had to an assistant was my mother who helped to do certain things.  And as I say we lived in a parsonage and from time to time we had to share the parsonage with members of the congregation who because they owned it thought that they could come by at any given time to enjoy the pleasures of our home.  So growing up in a parsonage and, and in a church was in many ways was a challenge but in many ways a, a blessing too because it, it really was an extended family.  I remember the people of that church in ways that I don't know that I remember much else.  I remember May Moore who had a tea room down the street.  I, I remember Sam and Mandy Shields.  Sam was about six foot six and, and Mandy was about four foot two and they were the original 'Mutt and Jeff'.  And just to see them coming to church they'd be dressed up to beat the band and we'd just stand on the outside of church and just laugh and, and see them coming.  I remember Wilson McCray who was my Sunday school teacher and, and Wilson McCray sat on the end of the row about six rows back in church and you could always count on Wilson McCray to get the feeling of the holy spirit somewhere in the service and the thing about it was he was a natty dresser.  And old Wilson McCray would wear loafers every Sunday.  He didn't wear lace up shoes he'd wear loafers because you see the, the shoes would get in the way because what he wanted to do was to take his shoes off and then run around the church and come back, put his shoes back on and then take his seat.  Wilson, Wilson McCray was a mess and I, you know I remember Gladys Watkins who was in charge of young people and always supervised the Easter morning breakfast that the young people's choir were in charge of and Bea Willis who was the, the, the piano player who, who was saved and converted from her job at the local honky tonk.  And she was a honky tonk piano player when nobody had a college degree in music.  No, nobody had been to a conservatory so you had to get somebody who simply knew how to bang out the notes and so she was a honky tonk piano player and she came to church and she played honky tonk.  It, it didn't matter I mean, it, it was the same people so you, you, you played the piano at the honky tonk and then you came to church and you played the honky tonk piano all over again.  But she taught us a little music, songs that I sing till this day because she did not have skills, she had love and she had time to give to us.  And so I remember time totally.
Speaker 1: What kind of--what was the congregation like at Mt. Olivet [Baptist Church, Columbus, Ohio]?  You've told us a little bit about some of the members.  But was it a big church, was it in terms of you know how we look at churches today you know we'll characterize a church as a big church.  What--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: It was a moderate church.  It was about five or six hundred people if you got them all in there at one time.  I think you know when you look--a, a child's perspective is different from the adult perspective of course.  So when I stood in the church as a child I thought it was huge.  As I look back upon it, it--with retrospect I recognize that probably if you had put four hundred people in that church the fire department would have come to put us all out, okay?  I mean the church was--and it literally was a fire trap.  I mean you know the, the floor rocked and rolled and the stairways were unstable and you know the kitchen would have never passed anybody's health department test.  But the folk struggled to keep it clean and, and I don't know how many chickens they killed and fried back there in that kitchen and, and they made life bearable because of so many things that we did not have but they knew how to make better.  I--Ethel Clark knew how to make a pudding out of eggs and cream and I don't know what all she did but she made, made it somehow that left an indelible impression upon our minds that here were people who not only loved us but they cared about us and, and they make, make a way for us and I will never forget it.
Speaker 1: And what kinds of activities were you involved in, in the church?  Were you an usher, a member of the choir?
Speaker 2: I was everything.  I was usher, choir member, Sunday school BYPU.  You know what BYPU is?
Speaker 1: What's BYPU?
Speaker 2: I thought you'd never ask.  If you had Sunday school in the morning then in the evening you had to do something else and that was called Baptist Young People's Union.  It subsequently was changed, the name was changed to BTU which was Baptist Training Union.  But you understand the whole day was consumed with church on Sunday.  We went to Sunday school in the morning.  There was morning service then there was dinner after church then there was an afternoon service where some other church would come over at 3:30 in the afternoon.  Then there was BYPU and, and evening Sunday school.  And then following that there would be an evening service and by the time that day was over you know you were all punch drunk and you would carry it home.  But, but you must understand that the way in which we lived was totally about the church and what it was, what it was trying to do and it made a difference in our lives.
Speaker 1: Did you enjoy it though?  I mean did you sometimes wish you could have a Sunday where you were playing baseball with your friends, that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Well the problem is I didn't know there was anything else to enjoy.  We couldn't go to the movie because the movie was segregated and, and so there were times when we could not do that.  We--it, it never occurred to me that I needed to play baseball on Sunday afternoon because I knew that I was going to be at church.
Story_ID: 8264
Speaker 1: Wittenberg University [Springfield, Ohio] your--that's where you attended college your freshman year.  What were your experiences like then and what was Wittenberg like?
Speaker 2: Well Wittenberg was one of the great challenges of my life in fact Wittenberg was one of the places where I first came to know and experience what failure was like.  Wittenberg was a campus of about 1600 students.  This is in the year 1960.  This is pre-Civil Rights era and the nation is still deeply divided.  So my choice out of those seven scholarships was to go to Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio which got me away from home but not too far away, forty five miles away, could always get home if I needed to but still I was away from the sheltering arm and watching eye of, of parents.  And so Wittenburg was sixteen hundred students, out of that population only nine of us were black.  And so my academic experience there was not a rich one at all.
Speaker 1: Why?  Why wasn't your academic experience a rich one?
Speaker 2: I wasn't supposed to be there.
Speaker 1: And they made it known that you weren't supposed to be there.
Speaker 2: The dean of the college told my father that this is really not a school designed for black people or as he may have said at the time, colored people.  And so my academic experience despite my best effort was not as productive as I would like for it to be.  Could we stop for a minute please?
Speaker 1: Yes we can.
Speaker 2: All right, the reason why I wanted--.
Speaker 1: Okay, tape is rolling with speed.
Speaker 2: So what ended up happening at Wittenberg?
Speaker 1: Well something strange and not so strange.  In fact at the end of my freshman year the college choir was about to take a trip to Europe and they discovered that I could sing.  Don't we all sing?  They discovered that I could sing and they had a problem.  They had a choir that had about sixty students in it and they had one black male in the choir.  Skip Hacker was the one black male in the choir.  Of course they had a problem--who is going to room with Skip Hacker?  So in order for Skip Hacker to have a room they decided that they would let me as a freshman, cause freshmen should not, were not permitted to be in the college choir.  So they decided that I could in fact become a part of the college choir because that would then give a roommate to Skip Hacker and we would get a chance to go to Europe for free and so we were going to do a concert tour in Europe.  They discovered that I had some skills and abilities through that method and even though my grades were average grades, I did not feel fulfilled at all and so it was my decision to leave Wittenburg.  Didn't punch out or anything of the sort, I just made the decision that I was going to leave because I knew it was not a place where I could grow and develop.  So my uncle, my father's older brother--(simultaneously).
Speaker 2: Did you go to Europe though?
Speaker 1: Oh, I went to Europe.
Speaker 2: And what was that like?
Speaker 1: Oh it was great.  It was great.  Can you imagine being seventeen years old and the first solo that you sing on a public stage is for the German National Broadcasting System?  And that's where, that's where I began.  So it was a good experience.  I mean we went to London [England], we went to Venice [Italy], we went to, to Rome [Italy], we went to Switzerland, we went to Austria, we went to Germany.  You know we were there, it was just absolutely a wonderful trip.  I was seventeen years old and what else can you ask for in life.  My, my first flight in the world was a flight from New York to, to London.  I mean you know I was seventeen years old.  What can, what can I say?  Sure it was a great trip. And when, when, when they discovered that I had something to offer they saw my grades and knew that I was you know not a happy camper so they offered to extend my scholarship and they offered to--wanted me to stay.  And I think life would have turned once they discovered that I had something that I could bring of value to them.  But I knew then that it was not the place for me.  My father's brother Charles, we called Uncle Budd, was in charge of secondary education for the state of Arkansas and was a graduate of what at the time was called Arkansas AM&N [Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College, Pine Bluff, Arkansas].  It was one of the original land grant colleges and located in Pine Bluff, Arkansas.  So it wasn't difficult for him to arrange for me to transfer from Wittenburg to, to Arkansas.
Speaker 2: So that was in 1962 or--?
Speaker 1: I graduate--I moved to Arkansas in, in 1961 actually the fall of 1961.
Speaker 2: And what were your experiences like there?
Speaker 1: Totally different.  Its, it was the difference between being a little fish in a big pond and being a big fish in a, in a--in a little pond.  And that, that was the difference.  I was immediately welcomed.  I immediately found my way, established friendships, began doing the things that I do best.  Interesting thing is I got a scholarship to be a part of the choir there and I went all the way through college on a music scholarship and I don't know what note from the next because they weren't asking me to learn the music, they just wanted me to sing it and that's what I did.  I wasn't a music major I just you know sang my way through school and, and that's literally what I did.  But by the time I got to my senior year I felt very affirmed and acknowledged by my classmates.  They elected me president of the student body and so by the time I, I got to my senior year I had at least come to the top of that heap and it was a, it was a good experience.
Story_ID: 8265
Speaker 1: So at this point are you still thinking you're going to be a lawyer?
Speaker 2: Ah-ha, now there was a shift somewhere around 1961.  I, I felt as though God was moving me in a different direction and so on Mother's Day of 1961 I preached a trial sermon and--(simultaneously).
Speaker 1: Where did you preach it?
Speaker 2: At Mt. Olivet Church in Columbus, Ohio [where his father was pastor]  I went home and preached my trial sermon there and I was licensed to preach in May, May 10th--no, May 14th of 1961 and, but I graduated from college in June or May of 1964.  Following that I went on to seminary in order to begin my theological training.
Speaker 1: Now the trial sermon that you preached like what happened, what led up to that, to that trial sermon?
Speaker 2: You know as I look back upon it, I'm not sure.  It was a whirlwind.  I know that one Friday evening I called my father and told him that I believe that God was leading me in this direction.  And a lot of, there's a lot of theological jargon that we use in order to describe such an event in one's life.  Whether or not that language is meaningful for everyone I'm not sure but I was confident that, that that was what was supposed to happen in my life and, and so on that Sunday afternoon the entire church gathered.  It was a mother's day afternoon and not a seat was to be had in the church.  It was, it was a phenomenal moment and I probably gave the worst sermon of my life.
Speaker 1: You think?
Speaker 2: Oh I think.  I think yeah.  I wouldn't want to do that again.
Speaker 1: And that didn't discourage you?
Speaker 2: Didn't discourage me.  I knew that--you know there was a lot of encouragement for me.  I mean there were Amens when they were not necessary.  There was affirmation when it was absolutely without cause. But nevertheless I, I would not be deterred and I moved forward from that point.
Speaker 1: So you decide to go to divinity school [Colgate Rochester Divinity School, Rochester, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: In Rochester?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what were your experiences like in Rochester?  And actually I'm sorry Dr. Hicks, had you met your wife at this point yet?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I met my wife in my senior year of college.
Speaker 1: Okay, and did, were you married when you went to divinity school?
Speaker 2: We were married after my first year of divinity school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  To understand my experience at the divinity school is to understand where I was psychologically at that point.  Even though I had done well at Arkansas [Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal College, Pine Bluff, Arkanas] I still had a sense of failure that--(simultaneously).
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: --I had gone to Wittenburg [University, Springfield, Ohio] and had not achieved in ways that I had expected to achieve.  I never will forget the, the closing senior class all school assembly in high school and that's the time when all of the awards and plaques and ribbons and everything else that you could possibly imagine were passed out to the senior class.  I got so many awards and so many accolades in that a school assembly that I had to take them all home in a suitcase, literally.  So when I had dealt with Wittenburg and I did not achieve at the same level you have to understand that that affected me greatly.  So Arkansas was a fresh breeze and it helped to put wind under my sail but it still did not satisfy me which is why I turned around and went back north to prove to myself that if given an opportunity that I could achieve at any level.
Speaker 1: And did you?
Speaker 2: And I did.  I did.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry Dr. Hicks, let me ask you this first before we move on.  What was your father's [Henry Beecher Hicks Sr.] reaction when you told him that you felt God was leading you in this direction to become a minister?
Speaker 2: I think he was pleased.  I don't think he was surprised but I think he was, he was, he was pleased by it.  I suppose my, my father enjoyed it and my mother believed it and so it was, it was very well received.
Story_ID: 8266
Speaker 1: After divinity school [Colgate Rochester Divinity School Rochester, New York] what do you do next?
Speaker 2: Well that's a quantum leap because from the time that I entered into divinity school at the end of my first year at divinity school I got married, I bought my first car, a Corvair that was white with red leather seats, four in the floor--don't pass by my Corvair (laughs).  But you must understand that I did that without a job.  I was, a couple of weeks later after I got the car, I was called to be the pastor of Second Baptist Church in Mumford, New York but at the time that I actually signed on the dotted line to buy a car, my first car, I had no job.  That was during a time when if somebody said in Rochester, New York, I'm a student at Colgate Rochester, it meant something in the business community.  It validated you and so I was able to go and buy a car and on my word alone, with no credit rating and no job they sold me a car, okay? It was a, a tremendous time in, in my growth and development.  So I graduated from college, went to seminary.  At the end of my first year of seminary, I was married, was called to be the pastor of the Second Baptist Church of Mumford, New York.  Now you must understand that the Second Baptist Church of Mumford, New York was a little-bitty church out in the country.  Mumford is a town that till this day has one flashing yellow light.
Speaker 1: Where is Mumford?
Speaker 2: Mumford, many people ask that question.  It's about twenty miles south of Rochester between Rochester and Buffalo, New York.  So it's upstate New York, it's in the snow belt and so that's where I was.  Now there are a couple of people who you know that also pastored Second Baptist church in Mumford, New York when they were students at Colgate Rochester.  One of them was a gentleman by the name of Mordecai Johnson.  So Second Baptist Church has had a distinguished history of being a training church for persons who have not only aspired to the ministry but who have gone on to do other significant things within the African American community.  Another person who was a graduate of Colgate Rochester believe it or not and whose doctorate is in New Testament I believe is Dr. James Cheek who is also a graduate of Colgate Rochester and became the president of Howard University.  So there's, there's a real linkage and a lot of history that flows through that particular church but it was there that I learned my first lesson of what it meant to be a pastor.  Up to that point I knew what it was to be a preacher's kid but from that point on I began to learn a different level of lesson about what it meant to actually try to lead a group of people from one place to the next.  Understand of course that the congregation was composed of about sixty or seventy people and when thirty five showed up on Sunday morning that was a banner crowd.  You had to get out the fan because there would be too many people in the house.  And so we didn't even lock the door of the church because nobody was going to come in.  Nobody knew Mumford was out there.  But that's where I first learned how to go from house to house and minister to people and establish relationships and that kind of thing.  So that's--(simultaneously).
Speaker 1: And was that a good experience--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: That was a good experience.  That was a good experience, yes.
Story_ID: 8267
Speaker 1: Let's jump a little bit and talk about when you went to work for the Urban League in 1968.  How did that opportunity come about?
Speaker 2: Well that opportunity came about in many ways I suppose because of industry.  I was pastoring Second Baptist Church of Mumford, New York which meant I was earning about seventy dollars a week at the church.  I had graduated from seminary.  By this time I'm married and I had one child.  My eldest son now is on the scene and I need a job,  I need a job that's going to help me survive a little bit better than that seventy dollars a week.  And so I got a job at the Rochester Urban League.  I was employed with what was called the on the job training program where I went around--while I worked with people who were unemployed, took them to their, their jobs and helped them to, to, to become gainfully employed.  I had a second job then that was also assigned to me.  I moved away from on the job training to a program called 'Operation Equality'.  And Operation Equality was a housing program in Rochester [New York].  And what we did, actually what we were doing was entrapment.  We would take white clientele and they would go to a home that said they had an apartment for rent and they would apply for the apartment and then tell the people that we'll call you tomorrow and let you know whether or not we want it.  And then we'd send a black couple in to try to get the same apartment and of course the apartment had been rented by then even though we watched the door, nobody else had gone there.  And so at that point there were, there were laws in the state of New York that prevented people from doing that kind of thing and so we took them to court and that kind of thing.  So Operation Equality, I sort of managed caseworkers who did that kind of thing.  Then there was a process through the National Urban League that I worked to, to organize and develop a program to train the outreach workers for many social agencies in the Rochester, New York area.  So I was doing a couple of things, I was first of all working with the church but I was also working within the Rochester community to try to make a difference in, in terms of, of life and the way in which people lived in that, in that era.  And of course now this is a time in history when the world is about to turn upside down.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Because it's in 1968 that [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] is assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: And what, what impact did that have on your work with the Urban League and just like the whole overall environment at the Urban League?  You know what was the mood there?
Speaker 2: Well I'm not sure that I can speak to the mood of the Urban League.  I can simply say that there was a, a lot of anger and hostility.  Rochester was set on fire.  I mean the, the community literally went up in smoke as a result of that, of that experience in [Dr.] Martin's [Luther King, Jr.] death. And you know for black people the, the world had taken a nose dive and it was never the same again.
Story_ID: 8268
Speaker 1: Were you starting to really emerge as a leader through your work in Roch--through your ministry and through your work with the Urban League?  Were you really starting to kind of stand out a little bit as a leader?
Speaker 2: I, I don't think so.  I, I think I mean I was pasturing a small, rural church and I was content to do that.  But I, I don't think that I had the, the presence within the, within the community in Rochester to actually save it if that was, was the case.  I subsequently, in 1968, I moved from Rochester [New York] to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and there I became the pastor of the Mt. Ararat  Baptist Church in Pittsburgh.
Speaker 1: Was that church a little bit bigger--(simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: It was much larger.  Yes, it was much larger.  On a, on a given Sunday morning the sanctuary would fill to about seven or eight hundred people so I went from sixty people to seven hundred people overnight and that was an interesting experience.  Understand Pittsburgh is an interesting place and it was in a section of town called East Liberty.  Biggest thing in East Liberty was of course the Mellon Church, the First Presbyterian Church [East Liberty Presbyterian Church, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] is there.  But understand East Liberty--at the time East Liberty was composed of several ethnic groups, blacks, Jews, Italians and it was all one huge ghetto.  And it was an interesting experience for me because I, I lived in the neighborhood, I lived around the corner from the church.  And two or three doors away from where I lived was the local house.
Speaker 1: The local what?
Speaker 2: House.  What shall I say?  It was a place where gentlemen were paying for certain exercises.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay (laughs).
Speaker 2: And yeah, and I used--(simultaneously).
Speaker 1: He's trying to make sure I'm awake.
Speaker 2: I'm trying to make sure that I'm appropriate in what I say.
Speaker 1: On tape.
Speaker 2: So all of this you know in, within the same community?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the, the police used my garage to catch people running drugs in the alley.  I mean, you know I was truly a part of the community and Mt. Ararat was and is, it remains a great church.  The people there are great people and I have nothing but the highest regard and affection for the people of, of the Mt. Ararat Church in the Pittsburgh community. I did begin to exercise a little strength of community activity.  Before I left Pittsburgh I, I had been elected as president of the local NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] so--(simultaneously).
Speaker 2: And what year was that?
Speaker 1: That was in 1973.  But almost shortly after I, I was elected president I really didn't have an opportunity to serve out my term because I was called Houston, Texas.
Speaker 2: And what did you do in Houston?
Speaker 1: I was pastor of the Antioch Missionary Baptist Church of Christ, incorporated in Houston, the oldest African American church in the city of Houston and it's right in downtown Houston so it was an old established congregation at the time.
Speaker 2: And how was this church different than the church of Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 1: The church in Pittsburgh had a hunger to change and to be radically involved in the community and to be the church.  The church in Houston had already achieved in many respects and was content to be the oldest church in Houston.  And I was a young radical at the time.
Speaker 2: How so, radical how so?
Speaker 1: Just in terms of wanting to make the church change and to be what I thought the gospel called it to become.  And, and so when you, it's, it was like mixing oil and water in a sense.  On the one hand those who saw the church as a stable, traditional, confined institution and my interest in trying to see to it that the church was integrated into its community and that it was adequately and responsibly and appropriately dealing with human needs.  And so that was where the, the ministry moved.  It was a good experience. I had some positive experiences in Houston but as I learned since, I thought God had other things for me to do.
Speaker 2: And did you kind of determine in Pittsburgh that you were like your ministry, your style was the type of ministry where you were going to be integrated in the community and that the church was going to be an integral part of the community and the community an integral part of the church?
Speaker 1: Oh absolutely, absolutely.  I, I wanted to do that critically for, for the church in, in Pittsburgh and, and we were moving in that direction.  We were moving in that direction.  And who knows why we get called to go in different directions but that happens.  I left feeling as though there was work yet to be done in, in Pennsylvania and yet feeling as though I was being urged and nudged to go in a different direction.

Speaker 1: You come to Washington, D.C. in 1977?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: And you're elected pastor of Metropolitan [Baptist Church, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: What does that mean exactly that you're elected pastor?
Speaker 2: That means that the church held a meeting, a formal meeting and I was voted by a majority of the congregation to take on the position of pastor of the congregation.
Speaker 1: So when you came to Metropolitan, right now you're about six thousand members strong?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: So when you came here in 1977, what was your congregation like?
Speaker 2: It was a membership of about two thousand and so it was--Metropolitan also was a church of great history.  This church, Metropolitan Church was born in a Civil War barracks that was operated by Quaker soldiers.  During the, during the civil war a prayer meeting was held in that barracks and as a consequence of that prayer meeting, Metropolitan was born.  At the time it was actually called Fourth Baptist Church and it, it was born in a section of town--if you know anything about Washington then you know that Georgetown is what's known as Foggy Bottom.  This area is known as Hell's Bottom.  So the church was literally born in the bottom of hell.  So its charge and its challenge was there before it.
Speaker 1: And it was founded by ten freed slaves?
Speaker 2: I'm not certain--.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --of the actual number of freed slaves that composed the original group.  The, the records are very scanty.  But we know that, that it was composed of those who were former slaves who, who started this church.
Story_ID: 8270
Speaker 1: When you arrived here at Metropolitan [Baptist Church, Washington, D.C.], what are some of like the most immediate needs you see here at this particular church?
Speaker 2: When I arrived at Metropolitan in 1977, it was as I say a church of its own substantial history.  Like the building itself the church had grown old, the membership had grown old and it needed to be refurbished from inside out if it were to remain both relevant and viable within its community.  But churches that had failed to make appropriate change could be found throughout the community.  And my task was then and my task is now to preserve the institution, to preserve not a place but to preserve a body of people who like those free slaves came together for the purpose of exalting Christ and for the purpose of making a substantial contribution to the community in which the church is set.  My, my first task was to establish myself within the community of faith so that people would know who I am, what I think, what I believe and to make that belief evident in terms of the way in which I operate with them.  And that's what I sought to do then.  It, it--and unfortunately sometimes the ministry of a church can be measured either by its numerical growth or measured as the church moves from place to place, or it can be measured by the various administrations that it has had.  Rarely when you hear people talking about churches do you hear them measuring the viability of a church based on the number of people it has fed, the number of marriages that have been saved the, the number of children that have been encouraged to go to college, the number of scholarships that have been given and on and on, the ways in which the church has really reached in and sought to embrace the lives of the membership.  It was my task to remind us that the church is not a place but the church is purpose and its purpose is in people.  Its purpose is in finding people where they are and then making a critical difference in those lives.  If I find anything in the gospels at all it is that message.  And so the task is to find a way to make the gospel dynamic and to make it actually live in the lives of people.
Speaker 1: And when you came to Metropolitan, you were a fairly young man.
Speaker 2: I beg your pardon, I'm still a fairly young man (laughs).
Speaker 1: You were a very young man.  You're a fairly young man now.  You were a very young man then.
Speaker 2: Thank you very much, yes (laughs).
Speaker 1: Was that someone challenging because you were coming into an environment where you know it was an older church, older congregation and also you were one of just a handful of ministers who had pastored at this church.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Of course whenever anyone new and particularly anyone new and young comes into an old and established anything there is a level of suspicion and mistrust and wonder about what that person is about, what that person is going to do and how effective that person's ministry is going to be.  And so those questions are never answered over night.  Those questions are answered through the living of years and through the extension of ones self over and over again until people are ready to, to ascend.  The pastorate is affirmed when one finds an intersection with the ministry with the great events, the watershed events in persons lives. Just to, to make it personal with you, you remember the person that baptized you, you remember the person that first led you to Christ.  You remember the person who buried someone that you love in your family and it is out of those experiences that you, you find a connection. That's a connection you don't have on day one.  But it is a connection that you have in year five, in year six and so forth and so on.
Speaker 1: Or you should have.
Speaker 2: Or you should have.  At least the opportunity is there that did not exist before.

Speaker 1: 'Ebony' magazine rated you, rated for lack of a better word as one of the top fifteen ministers in the country.  What is it about H. Beecher Hicks, Jr. that makes you one of the best?
Speaker 2: I have no idea what 'best' means.  Of course 'Ebony' magazine has great knowledge when it comes to understanding who's the best at most anything.  I mean they, they rate people all the time.  Whether that evaluation is valid is subject for someone else to, to debate.  It's nice to be acknowledged.  It's a wonderful thing to, to be acknowledged by the community in such a way, but once we begin to believe it and once we begin to read our own press clippings, then I think we've begun a slippery slope.  And so I'm, I'm thankful for it but I don't know what it means to be best.  I try, I'm simply trying to be best at what I do for the people whom I serve one Sunday at a time.  You know maybe on the day they were making evaluations I, I preached a good sermon some where and the right person heard it and the rest is history.
Speaker 1: I think it was a culmination.
Speaker 2: The, the next Sunday I probably preached the worst sermon you ever heard in your life.  So I, I'm, I'm really not affected by it, I'm really not.
Story_ID: 8272
Speaker 1: Are you ever surprised at all that you have accomplished in the ministry or, and even though I know you won't admit to this, or did you know once you decided you were going to become a minister that you would be a great minister?
Speaker 2: I still don't know it but I'm--what I'm surprised at is what's left to be done and the, the great number of things that I have yet to achieve.
Speaker 1: Such as?
Speaker 2: And that I'm running out of time.
Speaker 1: Such as?
Speaker 2: Oh I, I'd like to begin doing some things like building houses, really developing communities that can affect the way in which people live and relate to each other.  You know the bible talks about ways in which we're to be the true koinonia of God--the, the fellowship of God, the love of God that is reflected in this place and I keep trying to--it's, it's like Jeremiah who had clay in his hands.  He said the potter had clay in his hands and while he was working with it he got spoiled and so he had to start all over again.  And so I'm always in a position of starting all over again but believing in my heart and in my soul that there is something resident within the heart of man and within the heart of woman that is good and, and right and just and that can be shaped and molded into something that leads us to what Jesus called the kingdom of God, the place where God reigns, the place where his rule is preeminent.  And that's, that's the guiding force and impetus in my life.
Story_ID: 8273
Speaker 1: Metropolitan [Baptist Church, Washington, D.C.] is very well integrated within the community.  They have the school, adult literacy program, lots of ways in which you help the community.  But I'm wondering do you ever think about--or, or just what's your response to some people saying that the church is you know just becoming more and more like a business and what are some of your thoughts about that?  Do you think the church is too business like, not metropolitan but the black church in general?
Speaker 2: I think it's the same argument that people would use to say that the church should never be involved in politics and yet everything we do is touched politically even the water that we drink inside the church is controlled by a political force.  So if we fail to appreciate the forces that impinge upon the life of the church we only do detriment to ourselves.  So there is a level at which the church is a business.  The question is do we know how to handle our business?  And if we do then that will rebound to the benefit of the people and to the glory of God.  To ignore the fact that he church is a business I think is done at our own peril.  There are management issues for instance.  I, I suppose that right now there are about a hundred people employed by Metropolitan or its agencies okay?  Now I have a, I have a person on staff who is a human resource specialist.  That's business because when it comes down to figuring out how to pay your paycheck and how to make sure you get your benefits you want the church to be a business then because it will affect your livelihood and the way in which you're able to function in your world.  I have to keep the building in order.  The water has to run.  The electric lights have to be on.  All of that's business.  So if I don't operate it as a business unfortunately as my daddy would say, unfortunately we do not live on earth and board in heaven.  There's some reality beyond you know we got to get our head out of the clouds and understand that this life is real and yes it is a business.  It is also a spiritual gathering, a spiritual body.  It is the body of Christ.  It is a body of baptized believers but it is most definitely at the same time a business and I don't think we need to make a choice.
Story_ID: 8274
Speaker 1: I also want to ask you when you look at the community you know we, we have a lot of problems in the community, more particularly in the African American community.  Do you think that the church and I'm talking about the church in general is doing enough to address the needs of the community you know feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: It's easy to say no to that question.  I think however there are a lot of things that go on in the community that the average person never sees.  There are ways in which local churches and local pastors are reaching into their community and the 'Washington Post' will never put it on front page.  There are ways in which these houses of God have reached out into communities and save children's lives and have put people in college and gotten them out.  There, there are ways in which churches have, have just altered the whole complexity and complexion of neighborhoods in which they're sit, set but no one really no one--I mean can I call up the local radio station and say give me a half an hour to talk about what we're doing over here?  And so if we don't do that then unfortunately the value of what the church offers sometimes is lost.

Speaker 1: Like your grandfather [James Monroe Frazier], you too are an author and I wanted to just talk a little bit about some of your publications, more particularly your publication oh and the name just skipped me but I loved it cause it was a great not preaching--"My Soul's Been Anchored". You know when you talk about you know you give a lot of modern day examples of like biblical events and people and that kind of thing.  Who are some of your favorite not necessarily characters but some of the people that you mention in the book, who are some of your favorites?  And actually Dr. Hicks, can you tell us a little bit about what that book is about, "My Soul's Been Anchored"?
Speaker 2: "My Soul's Been Anchored" is really a follow on to the first book which was "Preaching Through a Storm."  Well it wasn't my first book but the first of a trilogy.  In "Preaching Through a Storm" I tried to talk about my experience in the church and the process of leading the congregation to understand the, the necessity for growth and change.  In "My Soul Has Been Anchored," I tried to say more about myself as a person so that people would not simply understand my experience in the institution but people would understand how my experiences have impacted upon me personally.  Just as in this interview we're talking about the, the stories of my life and the people who have impacted my life.  So "My Soul Has Been Anchored" does the same thing.  If you want to read the whole story of Wilson McCray for instance it's in "My Soul Has Been Anchored" and some of the other people in the Mt. Olivet Church and here who have meant much to me and who have shaped and molded my life.  They are the anchoring places, they are the anchoring source for my experience.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite story though from that book?
Speaker 2: Oh I think the Wilson McCray story is, is a good one, one of my favorites.  I suppose the better ones, not better but since you asked me for a favorite story is, is the story of the Easter Sunday when Pastor David Jones, who was my father's part time assistant, paid absolutely nothing, not even paid attention sometimes.  But he was up to pray on an Easter Sunday morning.  Now you got to understand that in the black community there is no Sunday like Easter Sunday.  Everybody goes to church that hadn't been to church.  They say Easter Sunday is the Sunday when you see all the, the 'CMEs'.  Those are the people who come on Christmas, Mother Day and Easter.  And so everybody was there, place was packed, everybody sweating you know children wearing shoes that hurt and ladies got hats on that are ridiculous and girls got on dresses that had too much starch in them.  And, and the place is just filled and David Jones was up to pray as the service begins. Well, Reverend Jones on Easter Sunday morning feels the spirit particularly and he's waxing forth when all of a sudden we see something floating out across the room and we don't know what it is.  And finally we discover that Reverend Jones has a set of false teeth that have left his mouth and he's, and the next thing we know he is on the floor trying to find these false teeth.  Well, by then Easter Sunday service is over cause ain't nothing anybody else can say except did you see Brother Jones on the floor trying to find his teeth.  Well those are the kinds of things that you know they're, they're the little funny stories that have, have marked my life and the people in them because even though h was on the floor looking for his teeth, the reality is he was a fine man and he was making a contribution.  And nobody will ever tell David Jones's story.  Nobody will ever find the name of Wilson McCray in anybody's book except mine.  And so I took the time to take some people who are unknown and unappreciated to simply give them their fifteen seconds worth of fame.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: That we retain an African American community, that in our pursuit, our--a homogenous society, in our pursuit of diversity at every level that we do not lose who we are, that we do not forget the struggle that we've come through and the value, the lessons which that struggle have provided for us.  I hope that we do not lose the value and the importance of the African American church.  Its contribution though sometimes flawed is also real.  It is our only institution, it is the only institution that black people own lock, stock and barrel.  And if we give it away I think we will have, I think we will have forsaken the faith of our fathers and our mothers.  I think we will make mockery of the graves of countless slaves that are known only to the depths of the Atlantic Ocean and for which there is no marker, there is no monument to the life of fait in which they lived and which was expressed in their, in their brows.  I, I hope we retain the sense of who we are and not be so interested in competing with other cultures that we fail to value our own and that's what I hope.

Speaker 1: When you look back at your life what stands out the most to you and why?
Speaker 2: There are so many things that stand out in my life, my family, my children, my parents, all of those individually, collectively have made me who I am.  They have provided for me the place of growth and the opportunity to become what God intended for me to become.  I've had a lot of wonderful experiences in this life.  I--God has seen to it that I've literally gone around the world.  And in so doing I hope that--and I've touched a lot of lives.  And so yeah, love of family, love of children all of those things are important personally but there are few things that come in your life that you know you'll never duplicate again.  A few years ago I had an opportunity to preach in Sydney, Australia for the Baptist World Alliance.  I'm not sure I preached a great sermon but I am sure that I stood in a great moment, a moment that it's, it's the World Series.  It's, it's the Super Bowl.  It's--after you do that you know professionally you, you've achieved a lot.  But the important thing is whether or not in that I've really been able to help somebody.  If one life has been changed if--even as you sit here today something speaks to your life and speaks to your experience and brings you closer to your history and closer to your faith and if I've been the instrument to do that, then my life is worth living.
Speaker 1: And do you ever have any regrets not pursuing a law, a career in law?
Speaker 2: Yeah I've thought about it.  I've thought about it.  I wonder whether or not I really could have done that.
Speaker 1: Do you really?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I really won--I, in fact I wonder whether or not I could not have merged the two professions where I really didn't have to make a choice.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.
Speaker 2: You know all that's hindsight but you know I think that just to talk about the business side of it for a minute there are a lot of churches that get into a lot of trouble that are legal, troubles that are legal.  And if I had been able to see that far enough in advance I probably could have had a career in both law and religion that you know would have been wonderful, a wonderful experience.  So maybe when I come back the second time I'll be able to do that you know (laughs).
Story_ID: 8278
Speaker 1: Why do you think history is important?  Why do you think preserving history is important particularly in the African American community?
Speaker 2: It's who we are.  The cliché is still true that if a people fail to learn from the events of the past they will be doomed to repeat them in the future.  And so I think that any people that neglects its history are people who are doomed for failure and for tragedy.  Why would we not?  Why would we not?  I'm just grateful that in some little way I managed to have a part of history and hopefully it was positive, it was productive, it was salvific  and it was redemptive.

Speaker 1: As we know you, you are a young man but how do you want to be remembered?  And I you know like I said you are a young man so that won't happen any time soon.  But what is it that you want people to say about H. Beecher Hicks Jr. when you are no longer here?  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: That's always the question of legacy and you know--.
Speaker 1: Well a little different in terms of--because I want to ask you that too, how would you like to be remembered and what do you think your legacy is?  So how would you love to be remembered?  What is it that you want people to say about you?
Speaker 2: I guess that he loved the church, loved the lord and loved his family and wanted to make a real difference in the world and did.  [Dr.] Martin [Luther] King [Jr.] said he wanted to be remembered as a drum major for justice.  Benjamin Franklin said that when he died he wanted them to put a tombstone that would say "Here lies Benjamin Franklin, printer, whose body lies fit for worms, but he shall reappear in a new edition revised and corrected by the author."  And I would hope that like Benjamin Franklin, one day I shall reappear revised and corrected by the author.
Speaker 1: And what do you think your legacy is?
Speaker 2: My legacy will be a people who are strong, who are determined, who are capable, who are competent and who are committed to the maintenance and the principles and of the teachings of Jesus Christ.
