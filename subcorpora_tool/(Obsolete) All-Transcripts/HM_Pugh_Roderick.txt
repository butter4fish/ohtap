Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Mr. Scott Stearns.  Sir could you please state your full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Roderick Wellington Pugh [HistoryMaker Roderick Pugh].  R-O-D-E-R-I-C-K, Wellington is W-E-L-L-I-N-G-T-O-N, last name is Pugh, P as in Paul, U-G-H, and I was named Roderick after my illiterate former slave grandfather, my father's [George Pugh] father.  Where did he get that name?  Well, you can just imagine that none of his own people gave him a fancy name like Roderick, but since you asked me (simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, yes sir. Can, can--
Speaker 2: I thought I would give you that little bit of information.  I have another thing that I can add to this and I will.  This grandfather of mine, my father's father, was totally illiterate and when he learned that [President] Abraham Lincoln had freed the slaves and that he was truly free, one of the first things that he did was to search for someone who could teach him how to sign his signature, because up to that particular time, whenever his signature was needed on a document or something, he just put an X mark.  Of course, that was a routine for uneducated slaves.  And I just wanted to give you that little background historically because it is really sort of common place among African Americans in many instances.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I'm gonna ask you about your ancestors once we get started but the first thing we do is try to establish who you are and, you know, where we are right now before we get started.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: So, sir what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: June 1st, 1919, Richmond, Kentucky, U.S.A.
Speaker 1: And what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Well at the present time I am a retired clinical psychologist and I am professor emeritus.  Emeritus means retired, of Loyola University here in Chicago [Illinois].  I was on the faculty there for a number of years in the psych department. Is that--?
Speaker 1: That'll suffice.  Now, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: What is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date?  It is December 15th.  Oh, today's date is the 16th, that's right.
Speaker 1: Two thousand--
Speaker 2: I'm still twenty-four hours behind.
Speaker 1: Yeah 2005, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, no we're in 2005, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We're in 2005, and we're in your apartment here in Hyde Park in Chicago.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, this is my home here in Hyde Park, Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay, now we--
Speaker 2: It's called Cornell Village.
Story_ID: 284060
Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask as kind of a warm-up.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And the first one, they only require a short answer, a very short answer.  The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: A favorite food?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Not really.  I do watch my diet very carefully.  I have a favorite diet and the favorite diet is to minimize fats, particularly, and to give my body the kind of nourishment that my body needs and the older I get, I told you I was eighty-six, the more attention I pay to that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which I think helps to account for at least the level of my functioning at the age that I am.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Color?  That's something I've never thought about, but I would say that the colors I'm wearing currently, right now, tend to be my favorite colors.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I prefer warm weather, and you know, I'm a June bug, I was born the first day of June, and I was told that it was a hot summer's day in Kentucky at the time that I was born.  So I, I prefer summertime to wintertime.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Not really.  By the way, I have traveled all over the world.  One of the places that I have traveled to, perhaps quite a number of times in the last ten, fifteen years or so and that Barbados, West Indies.
Speaker 1: Okay, now the last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: That comes as quite a surprise.  I can't think of one right off hand.  You know as we go along, I'm talking, some favorite phrase of mine may come to mind and I'll let you know then, but I can't think of anything particularly.
Story_ID: 284061
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you about your family history (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [George Pugh] side of the family, and we'll start with your mother's side, and then we'll get to your father's side, so I'm not gonna-
Speaker 2: Fine.
Speaker 1: I don't want to leave anything out on your mother's--
Speaker 2: Oh, very, absolutely okay--
Speaker 1: --side before we go to your father.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Lena, L-E-N-A, second name was Bernetta, B-E-R-N-E-T-T-A, and last name was White, W-H-I-T-E.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Well, her place of birth was Nashville, Tennessee.  Her, oh yes, okay, she was born August the 29th, 1895.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side of the family?
Speaker 2: Well, rather little, but the little I know is sort of interesting.  It so happens that I was mentioning just a minute or so ago something about my father's side of the family that my grandfather [Roderick Pugh] was an illiterate former slave.  Now, the interesting thing is that I have had the privilege of talking with my great-grandmother on my mother's side of the family, my mother's grandmother, and I remember when I was a small child, I must, I couldn't have been more than six, seven years old at the time I talked with her, and she was a very light skinned African American.  She was at least two or three shades lighter than I and as a matter of fact, we used to use this phrase, she could pass for white in a crowd.  But she happened to be that way because as a slave she had been owned by her own father, who also owned her mother.  And that was in Nashville, Tennessee.  Her name was Clara.  Her last name was Cheatham, C-H-E-A-T-H-A-M.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did she live a long time?  I guess she had to, I guess
Speaker 2: I think she lived into her eighties at least, but other than that I don't, I really don't remember.
Speaker 1: Are there any stories from that side of the family that have passed down and that you (unclear) tell us?
Speaker 2: Well, the, the, I think the one story that, you know, that was passed down was the fact that she was a slave owned by her father and she and her mother, of course, he also owned her mother, they were servants in the big house.  So they never had to live out in cabins and so on and so forth.  And of course, you know, we do have a phrase for servants who lived in the house.  They were called house Ns, you know.
Speaker 1: Yes, I know. Now is there a story (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And the thing about it is she told the story about again when [President] Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, you know, she said that when Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, quote, it caused me to have to move from my father's house, because her father let her know that once she was no longer a slave, she could not live in the big house, she had to move, and, of course, she was out in the world really, on her own for the first time.
Speaker 1: Is there a, do you have any idea how old she was at that point in her life?
Speaker 2: I'm not very sure about that.  She might possibly, you mean at the time that she had to move?
Speaker 1: Yes, right.
Speaker 2: Well, she was a young woman, relatively speaking at that time.  And I don't think that she was yet to marry for example.  But other than that, I really don't know.  By the way, the information I have given you just know about her, I got directly from her when I was a small child, and we happened to be together at my grandmother's place, which, of course, was, she was my grandmother's mother, and so we got involved in a conversation one afternoon and she told me all of this and I have remembered it ever since.
Story_ID: 284062
Speaker 1: There any other stories from your mother's [Lena White Pugh] side of the family?
Speaker 2: Not particularly.  My mother's side of the family was from Tennessee and particularly my mother's, my mother was from Nashville, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Did she talk about growing up in Nashville and what it was like when she--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: What did she tell you about growing up in Nashville?
Speaker 2: Primarily she talked about Pearl High School [Pearl-Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School, Nashville, Tennessee] which she attended in Nashville.  Pearl High School was, at the time that my mother was in Nashville, was the most prominent high school for African Americans at the time, and so as a result of the fact that she was from Nashville and Pearl High, she, of course, also knew about Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee], which was the undergraduate school that I attended.  And because she was in Nashville and that also allowed her to have a chance to meet my father [George Pugh] who was a student at Meharry Medical College [Meharry Medical Department of Central Tennessee College, Nashville, Tennessee] at the time.
Story_ID: 284063
Speaker 1: My dad had to work his way through his entire education.  He did not go to school at all until he was eleven years of age, and he managed to work his way through his undergraduate requirements and ended up at Meharry [Medical College; Meharry Medical Department of Central Tennessee College] in Nashville [Tennessee], and he did this primarily by barbering, and he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, before you go into that, can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 1: George is his name.  George Wilmer, W-I-L-M-E-R, is his middle name, last name Pugh.
Speaker 2: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 1: My dad was born, let me see, he was about fifteen years older than my mother [Lena White Pugh].  I have his, oh yeah, I'll think about his birthday.  Right now it's not coming to me too well.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  Well what do you know about your ancestors on your father's side?  You talked about your grandfather being born in slavery and the story about--
Speaker 1: Okay, my father was born in November of 1877.  November of 1877 and I think, let me see, I believe it was November the 15th or something like that.  I have sort of forgotten the date.  But, my dad was about seven or eight years older than my mother.  I remember that.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And his father was born into slavery and that Roderick Pugh.
Speaker 1: His father, my grandfather, was this illiterate former slave who was born in the backwoods of Alabama.  And my father, as a matter of fact, was born in Alabama.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now what's the name of the town in Alabama?  I think you all have, you have pictures of the town you were showing me.
Speaker 1: Well, my father was not born in the town, he was born in the backwoods of Alabama, and it was a backwoods near the vicinity of a, a place in the state called Whatley [Alabama], W-H-A-T-L-E-Y.  In 1937, when I returned from my freshman year at Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee], when I got off the train my dad said to me, "Son, when you get home, repack your bags because you and I are going to drive down to Alabama.  I have come to a point where I want you to see where it is that I came from."  And, of course, I was thrilled because I'd always heard about this place back in the woods of Alabama outside of Whatley.  And another thing is that I had just mastered the whole business of driving an automobile so I knew that if my father and I were gonna drive down that I would do most of the driving and I was very thrilled about this.  And, by the way, he had deliberately asked my mother not to come along because he wanted just a vacation trip between the two of us.  And it was one of the most delightful experiences I ever had.
Speaker 2: Now--
Speaker 1: That was the first time, by the way, that I ever met any relatives from his side of the family.
Speaker 2: Do you know the story of how your family got interested in pursuing education and how he decided to become a doctor?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know the story.  At least I know a part of it.  First of all, my father intellectually was a very bright guy. And he always, having been born in the very oppressive situation that African Americans were traditionally born into in Alabama, in that period of time, he always wanted to quote get out make something of himself, quote, unquote.  That's what he said.  And one day he saw a white man in the vicinity carrying a little black bag, and he said, he was maybe less than a teenager at this point, he said, "Who's that guy over there with this black bag?"  And somebody said, "Well that guy is a doctor.  He's a medical doctor.  He goes around and treat the sick," and this is where my father first developed the whole idea of becoming a medical doctor, and interestingly enough, he stuck to his goal and eventually graduated from Meharry Medical College [Meharry Medical Department of Central Tennessee College, Nashville, Tennessee] in 1917.
Story_ID: 284064
Speaker 1: Now the way that he [Pugh's father, George Pugh] and my mother [Lena White Pugh] met each other was he had learned to cut hair at a school in Selma, Alabama, when he was pre-college, and that's the way he worked his way through school, cutting hair as a barber.  And when he was at Meharry, he was constantly in debt to Meharry Medical College [Meharry Medical Department of Central Tennessee College, Nashville, Tennessee], in spite of the fact that he cut hair as much as he had time to do so, and one Saturday he was working at a barbershop in Nashville [Tennessee], cutting hair, and as he was working on a guy, a girl walked past the shop on the side walk outside.  He said to the shop owner, "Hey, who is that young lady that just walked past the shop?"  The shop owner said to my dad, "George Pugh, you might as well put that out of your mind.  That girl comes from one of the better families in Nashville."  That same girl became my mother.  He found somebody who knew my mother who could introduce him to my mother.  And it was a fantastic story.  And he and my mother were married here in Chicago [Illinois] in 1918 because by that time, my mother's family had been a part of the so-called Great Migration from the South to the North, and her parents and in 1918 were living in Chicago, and so the wedding between my father and mother took place right here in this city, and, you know, at the time the stockyards were really going then.  My grandfather who came up here, of course, with my grandmother, was in the city no longer than twenty-four hours or so and he had a job at the stock market, at the stockyards really.  And so, if one is able to go back two generations into one's family history, it can be a very interesting thing to do, and particularly if they happened to have been African Americans.
Speaker 2: Okay, now do you have any brothers and sisters?
Speaker 1: I'm the only child.
Story_ID: 284065
Speaker 1: Do you think you take after your mother [Lena White Pugh] or your father [George Pugh]?
Speaker 2: I take after both of them.  Undoubtedly after both of 'em.  My parents both were, loved me very much and they invested a great deal into me and I was a project for them and I think I satisfied their hopes and wants and so and so forth, but they were both very much oriented educationally, not only for themselves but particularly for me, and they gave me from the get-go every advantage and so I attribute much of my success in life to the inspiration I got from both of them in terms of this, and you know, I learned early on what a parent and so many African American kids don't catch onto today, and that is if you're gonna get ahead in life, you have to know something.  You have to get educated, and I took to it, you know, and  I ended up being a university professor, as a matter of fact I took to it so much (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, now--
Story_ID: 284066
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory, a first childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Oh, I have a number of them (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, no, an earliest one, the very first one.  If you don't it's all right, but if you as I said, if you do (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't have any one that I would label as, as an early childhood, as the earliest memory.  No, not really.
Speaker 1: What are some of the earliest?
Speaker 2: Well, I'll tell you.  One of the earliest recollections that I have of being with my mother [Lena White Pugh], we are sitting at a little table as a black boy on the table, lying flat on the table and she is teaching me the alphabet and the numbers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That is the earliest recollection I've had, I have of being in the company of my mother.  Can you imagine that?
Story_ID: 284067
Speaker 1: We always ask this question and, what were some of the sights--I know you grew up the first ten years in Richmond, Kentucky, and then you moved at age ten to Dayton, Ohio, but what was some of the sights and sounds and smells of Richmond, Kentucky first?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, being born in 1919, Richmond, Kentucky was very rural.  It was a small town, and the smells and so on and so forth had to do with horses, cows, pigs.  As a matter of fact, my father [George Pugh], coming from the Deep South, he just about raised all of our own food.  We had a garden in the back of the house and even the garden had not only vegetables, and so on, but we raised chickens and pigs.  And we had a little shack back there that was a smokehouse.  And when the, in the fall when the hogs were slaughtered and so on and so forth, the meat was hung in the smokehouse and preserved that way.  I don't remember how the smokehouse actually operated, but it was a very rural kind of setting in spite of the fact, of course, my father spent most of his time actually in his medical office, or in those days, as a matter of fact, he spent more time making house calls, I think, than he did treating people in his office, because many of my father's patients, when we lived in Richmond, Kentucky, was scattered all over the countryside, they were farmers.  And he had a car, and you know, the automobile was sort of invented around that time and he was one of the first African Americans in Richmond, Kentucky, to own an automobile and it was a necessity for him because it allowed him to have access to his patients who were scattered all over the surrounding farmland of Richmond, Kentucky.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what kind of car he had?
Speaker 2: Sure, a Model T Ford.
Speaker 1: That seemed to be the standard in those days, right?
Speaker 2: That was the standard.  If you had a car in those days, most people I knew had Model T Fords.
Speaker 1: Are there any stories associated with the car, or about him first getting the car, that you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, in a sense.  He never had an accident with the car, fortunately, none that I knew of.  But my dad was, both my parents were always very interested in educating me, and I have always been so grateful for that.  So one of the earliest recollections that I have about the car is that my father and then my mother [Lena White Pugh] and I were sitting and we were the only people in the car, sitting in the front seat.  I was in the middle initially, but when my father stopped the car to do something, go in and see a patient or something, when he got back in the car, he said, "Son come and sit in my lap, I want to show you how to steer the car."  And, of course, I was thrilled.  So I sat in his lap, he started the car up, and of course, at first he had his hands on the steering wheel and I had mine, and you know, for a few seconds or so he'd take his hands off and I, you know, I steered the car.  You have to remember this is in a small country town and there was not very much traffic, and so we didn't have to worry about that but on the other hand my mother was sitting there, very concerned about the fact that my dad was teaching me how to steer the car and I was no more than about four or five years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I grew up becoming, of course, very comfortable behind the steering wheel of an automobile, and I am very thankful for that (laughter).
Story_ID: 284068
Speaker 1: When you were growing up in Richmond [Kentucky], your household consisted of your mother [Lena White Pugh], your father [George Pugh]--
Speaker 2: And me.
Speaker 1: --you.  That, is that--
Speaker 2: That was it.
Speaker 1: No grandparents stayed with you or anything like that or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: We had, we had a lot of friends so my mother was a very sociable sort of person and, as a matter of fact, it was in a Richmond, Kentucky, that I first became interested in psychology, however, at that particular time, what I, what I did in my interest was not labeled psychology, I can label it psychology now because I know what it was, but at that particular time.  You wanna hear the story?
Speaker 1: Uh-hm.
Speaker 2: Very interesting.  You know in those days in the small town people tend to know each other and in the summertime when, and my mother was a housewife, and there were a lot of women who were essentially housewives and their husbands were out working and they would be at home, so my mother said to me one afternoon, "Get yourself ready because I'm going over to Mrs. So and So to visit her for a while, and she has a little girl and while she and I are talking, maybe you and the little girl can play together and so on and so forth."  So, this was nothing unusual whatsoever.  My mother would come up with something like this quite often.  So we got ready and went over to this lady's house and she took us into the living room and at first there was no sign of this little girl, but the lady started talking about the fact that her daughter was old enough to be walking independently, but although she was walking, she always had to hold on to something, and I sat there and listening.  Say I was only about seven years old.  I sat there and listening to this lady talking about this little girl and while she was talking the little girl appeared in the doorway doing exactly what her mother said.  She was holding on to things as she walked and she finally made her way over to where we were and so on and so forth and by the time that happened, there was a loud noise in the back of the house.  And the two mothers jumped up to run back to see what the noise was like, leaving the little girl and me in the living room by ourselves, but having heard the mother complain about the fact this child was not walking independently, I stood up and held my hands out like this, and suggested that she take hold of my hands, which she did.  And so I started backing up and, of course, she followed me, and when we got to the opposite wall of the room, I turned us around and started backing up across the room again, but then I let go of her hand.  But I kept my hands extended but not touching hers and kept backing up and she held her hands out like that, and she followed me, and interestingly while (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did she learn how to walk at this point?
Speaker 2: --and while she was following me like that, her mother came back into the room and turned to me and said, "What did you do?"
Story_ID: 284069
Speaker 1: With this happenstance, and that's what it was, I accidentally got this little girl walking free without holding on to anything and, at the time we were half way cross the room, the two mothers came back into the living room, and the mother turned to me, she says, "She's walking," she says, "What did you do?"  And, of course, I was seven years old.  I said I didn't do anything, you know.  But I did explain exactly what it was, exactly what had happened.  But when I, when I look back on that instance, that was my first successful psychotherapy case.  That was the first time I really became curious about human behavior.  And I can remember that.
Speaker 2: So, there's a picture you have, and we'll show it later on at the end of the interview of the football team, your father's [George Pugh] football team that he was coaching, and here you are, you're the little mascot at age four, you know.  Is there a story around that that you could tell us?
Speaker 1: Not particularly (Simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Just a--
Speaker 1: You know the point is that my father had a couple of gold teeth in the front and he would brag about the fact that he got his teeth kicked out playing football, you know, well, when my dad would brag about the fact that he got his teeth kicked out playing football, that did not encourage me to want to play football.  But the point is that I enjoyed being the mascot, as you can see.  I'll just show you the picture.  And so, when the Richmond High [School, Richmond, Kentucky] team played, you know, he often took me along or my mother [Lena White Pugh] came along and I was the mascot, and, of course, then when that picture was taken there I am sitting there in the front and center.  But, I myself, never played football.
Speaker 2: Did you like sports when you were a little kid?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I went into stuff like swimming and tennis.  Yeah, so I did a lot of swimming and I, at one particular point I played a lot of tennis.
Story_ID: 284070
Speaker 1: What were some of the other things you liked to do growing up and how would you describe your personality as a child at that stage in Richmond, Kentucky?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well one of the, one of the things that is so important to understand and think about in the African American kids growing up at the time that I did in a small southern town, that was very likely pretty much run by members of the Ku Klux Klan [KKK].  Now the reason I say possibly because at least a couple times a year the Klan had marches and generally speaking, when the Klan marched it was one of the more important and exciting events happening in Richmond, Kentucky, and hordes of people would turn out to see the Klan march down Main Street which, of course, was the principal street going through (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now would the black community turn out to see this?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  I was about to come to this.  Yeah, the blacks would come out to see the Klan marches, after all, a little excitement.  But the point is we would stand on the sidewalks rigid and almost not talking or moving because we were afraid that any movement that we made could be misinterpreted.  And, at that time, any one of the Klan members could have killed any one of us and probably not even have been arrested for it.  That's how the situation was that bad in the South when I was a child.  And the Klan--
Speaker 1: Why would the, would just the children come out and grown people too, to watch the Klan (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, grown--
Speaker 1: I mean the black people, the black community.
Speaker 2: Oh, grown man, grown people and children of black community, they would come out to watch the Klan because it was, at least exciting, and as long as they stood on the sidewalk, immobile, no saying anything, then they were as well protected as they possibly could be.
Speaker 1: Now did the Klansmen wear their full regalia?
Speaker 2: Oh, they wore full, total regalia.  There was no way of identifying anybody who was in the parade because they were all hooded.  Absolute, totally hooded and we always imagined that the chief judge in the court at Richmond was a Klan member.  We never had, at least I never had any proof of it.  We never knew exactly who the Klan members were, but we felt they were fairly important individuals and there was a lot of evidence that members of the Klan essentially ran the town.
Speaker 1: Now were there incidents of racial violence in Richmond, Kentucky when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, fortunately, no serious incidents of racial violence.  There were some minor things and so on.  Because all of the African Americans were afraid of white people.  No African American at the time I was a kid in Richmond would ever challenge a white person period because of the power of the Klan, Richmond, Kentucky, a small southern town, and I was born in 1919, and you know, and I was a kid during the early '20s [1920s] and so on and so forth.
Story_ID: 284071
Speaker 1: Actually my mother [Lena White Pugh] and I and I think my father [George Pugh] too, well, as a matter of fact I know that my father, we were all very relieved when my father's arrangement to move from Richmond [Kentucky] to the North came to fruition.  And one of the things that had stimulated that, and I remember this very carefully, I think I was about maybe four or five years old, one winter's day, we had a pot-bellied stove in this small house in Richmond where he lived, my mother and my father and I, it was in the wintertime, were sitting at the stove and both of my parents were crying, and, of course, I was very upset seeing both of my, so I would say, you know, "Mom, what are you crying about?" "Dad, why are you crying?" and so on and so forth.  And, of course, at that stage of the game I was small enough that whatever explanation they had given me I probably wouldn't have remembered, but some years later, I recalled the incident and said to my dad one time, I said, "By the way, you remember the time that you and mother was sitting at the pot-bellied stove and you were crying?" and because they were crying, I started crying.  I was only crying because they were crying, and he said, "Oh yeah, I remember that."  I said, "Well what were you and mother crying about?"  He said, "Well, I'll tell you, we went to Judge [William Rodes] Shackelford's court, I had to go to his court to give some medical testimony, and he asked me a question and I responded to the question with the simple answer yes.  And because I had not said yes, sir, he dressed me down before the court to such an extent that I became concerned about remaining in Richmond, Kentucky.  And then I came home and I told your mother about this incident.  She was equally upset and that's what we were crying about."
Speaker 2: This is life and death, right?
Speaker 1: Well, that's what the South was like at the time I was a small child in the South.  This is one of the reasons my father, you know, wanted to relocate and finally live above the Mason Dixon Line where, at least the law could be as much on his side as on anybody else's.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now why did he choose to move to Dayton, Ohio?
Speaker 1: Well, first of all, Dayton is not that far from Richmond, Kentucky.  And he had gone to do some exploration in states above the Mason Dixon Line, which is the Ohio River, and as a result of his little explorations in the North, the near north, he selected Dayton for whatever reason.  I'm very happy that he did.  I enjoyed growing up in Dayton (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now there's a, now, I-75, interstate 75, runs from Dayton right down to Lexington [Kentucky], and, you know, then there's Route 25 that branches off to Richmond.  Was that, is that, was that a natural route even in those days from (unclear)?
Speaker 1: I don't think I-75 as such existed, but I'll tell you--
Speaker 2: Not as such, but I said was there a route that really was duplicative?
Speaker 1: Oh yes.  And the thing about it is, you know, when we lived in Richmond going to Lexington for a day or so, was a big deal and, you know, that was when you were sort of, you know, letting your hair down, you'd drive over to Lexington, you know.  And by the way, I had an uncle in Lexington who was a physician.  His name was Wendell, Dr. [Thomas] Tyler Wendell, and he had a couple of daughters, one of whom went to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] also.
Story_ID: 284072
Speaker 1: So you all (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What was--?
Speaker 1: --did move to Dayton, moved to Dayton, Ohio, when you were ten years old, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was ten years old when--.
Speaker 1: So this is 1929.
Speaker 2: That was 1929.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah and, of course, you know something else was going on in 1929, the stock market crashed, and so, we were, we moved to Dayton to join my father [George Pugh] in Dayton.  My mother [Lena White Pugh] and I moved from Chicago [Illinois].  We had been staying with my grandmother up here while my dad was relocating his practice.  And then when he found a home and office and everything like that, then he sent for my mother and me to join him in Dayton, and so I'm very happy really that he selected Dayton because I enjoyed Dayton very, very much.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I guess in those days you lived on the west side of Dayton, right?  Do you remember your address in Dayton when you were (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, of course.  We finally lived at 614 West 5th Street, but our first address in Dayton was on the second floor of a building at 5th and Mound Streets which is right across from Cox's Drugstore.  You remember that?
Speaker 1: Right.  I was--
Speaker 2: You remember Dr. [Leroy] Cox?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir, I do.
Speaker 2: Well, let me tell you, I, of course, Dr. Cox and my father were very good friends because Dr. Cox was a pharmacist, my dad was a physician, but my dad's, my dad rented the whole second floor of a building that was caddy corner across from Cox's Drugstore there and he had a room or two set aside for his office and the rest was set aside for residents.  And, as a matter of fact, the first job I ever had was as a soda jerk in Cox's restaurant, Cox's Drugstore.  And I'm smiling when I talk about this because Cox was a very smart guy, you know.  So when I got to be around fifteen years of age, you know, Cox always had kids working at the soda counter, and so, you know, I'd never worked and so and so forth and I wanted to sort of test my independence.  My parents never pushed me to particularly work.  But I went over to Cox's and told him that I was interested in getting a job at the soda counter, and so he said okay, and when the next time he had a vacancy, he got in touch with me and I was, by the way I was a student at Steele High School [Dayton, Ohio] at the time.  I think I was fifteen years old or something like that.  And he was very smart because he told me, he says, now you're gonna be working at the soda counter.  He says now you can eat all the ice cream you want except don't eat it in front of the customers.  If you wanna, if you wanna a dish of ice cream while you have a break or something, give, make yourself a dish and take it in the back and, and eat it and then come back and tend to the business, and then while you're eating the ice cream, you have to keep your eye on what's going on at the counter.  Well, anyway, so the first week that I was a soda jerk, or at Cox's, I ate so much ice cream that I got sick and after that I hardly ate ice cream at all.  This is why I thought Cox was a smart guy, you know.  He says when these guys come on, I'm gone tell 'em to help themselves at ice cream and after a few days, they won't, they won't even want to touch it anymore.  So, that's essentially what happened.  So I, when I think about this, I always have to laugh.  But that was the first job I ever had.
Speaker 1: What was Dr. Cox's first name?
Speaker 2: You know I used to know his first name, Lloyd I believe, wasn't it?  I think it was Lloyd [sic.].  I'm not sure about that.
Speaker 1: He treated me when I was two or three years old for a sinus infection, and it's a procedure that required placing these sticks up your nose and it's something that my family still talks about now.   Because I didn't like--
Speaker 2: Well why is it they didn't take you to an M.D.?
Speaker 1: Well, Dr. [Lloyd] Cox is who they said they took me to.  I mean who they--
Speaker 2: He was a pharmacist [sic.].
Speaker 1: Well, they called him Dr. Cox and that was his--
Speaker 2: Well, everybody called him Dr. Cox.  I don't know whether he had an M.D. or not.  But it's, it's, I just always assumed that he had some sort of a pharmacy degree.
Speaker 1: They lived at 29 Mound Street, very close to 5th Street, you know, and that's where--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --that's where I was taken.
Speaker 2: I still can't get over the fact that you and I are from Dayton, Ohio, and I had never expected that.  That's interesting.
Story_ID: 284073
Speaker 1: Now the neighborhood that you lived in growing up was the heart of the black community in Dayton [Ohio] in those days.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: I know that.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: And it was breaking up by the time that I was born, but it was at that time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) By the way, after my father [George Pugh] got his, his feet on the ground, we then moved east on 5th Street to 614 West 5th Street.  I have pictures of that house.  And the house was big enough to form both a residence as well as to provide room for my, as a matter of fact, the house, the building that he bought, had been a, a three-apartment building.  There were two apartments on the ground floor and one big apartment on the second floor above, and so when he bought the place, he used the smaller apartment, he converted that into his office and other two apartments were converted into a residence.
Speaker 1: Now only a Dayton person would appreciate these kinds of questions, but was it near the Carnegie library [East 5th Street Branch, Dayton, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, no.  This was on the west side.  This was on the west side (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.  I'm talking about the west, yeah there's a library on 5th Street on the west side.
Speaker 2: Did you know where, do you remember where Shaw's Cleaners was?
Speaker 1: Not, not, no I can't say I, I'm thinking but I don't exactly remember.
Speaker 2: Well, I lived right next door to Shaw's Cleaners, and it was caddy cornered across the street from Wayman [Chapel] A.M.E. Church [Dayton, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Of course, you know that church has been decimated now.  Isn't that awful?  That is, and one of the reasons, you know that first of all it was a beautiful church, and it was the first church in Dayton to be built from the ground up by an African American congregation.
Speaker 1: That's generally true in most cities that the A.M.E church was the first one that was built by the black community.
Speaker 2: Well when we got word that Wayman had to be torn down, you know, naturally, by the way by that time I was living here in Chicago [Illinois], but I was so upset about that that I went to Dayton and I arranged for the beautiful stain-glass window depicting Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane, I arranged for that stained-glass window to be moved from that original Wayman Church to the current Wayman Church that we have.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there's a little plaque at the bottom of the window.
Story_ID: 284074
Speaker 1: You said, I think off camera, that you were a Baptist in Richmond, Kentucky, but when you moved to Dayton [Ohio] you became part of your mother's [Lena White Pugh] congregation at Wayman [Chapel A.M.E. Church, Dayton, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Well, I became a Baptist in Richmond, Kentucky, at the age of six.  There had been a revival.  You remember revivals?
Speaker 1: Tell people what they are, and what they were like in those days (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) On an annual basis, they would have a, a well-named evangelist, they were called, come to town and for about three or four nights, sometimes a whole week, he would, he or she would give service, have services primarily for the specific purpose of saving souls, guaranteeing people, you know, that they are not really set up to go down the slide, and believe it or not, there was, and every spring or whatever, at some time of the year, the evangelist who would come to Richmond and be at the Baptist church for a whole week and they worked on you at, in the evenings, and when I was six years old, quote, unquote I got religion during one of those evangelistic forays, and joined the First Baptist Church in Richmond, Kentucky, at the age of six, and was baptized and all that.  But by the time my dad [George Pugh] moved his practice to Dayton, at first I affiliated with Zion Baptist Church [Dayton, Ohio] which was the church he joined, but then I also went to my mother's church a couple of times and we had a Reverend A.E. Allen [ph.] and wife who were just fantastically charming people.  And Mrs. Allen was a pianist, and she organized something that was very innovative for Dayton at that time, which was called the Wayman string trio.  It consisted of three kids on a violin and a pianist.  And we finally developed such a reputation that eventually we performed over radio station WHIO [Dayton, Ohio].  Can you imagine that?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's one of the first radio stations, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Four black kids and this was back in, that was before I graduated.  I finished high school [Steele High School, Dayton, Ohio] in Dayton in 1938, so it was primarily during the last, the five or six years before I graduated high school.  That was a Wayman string trio, and--
Speaker 1: You played the violin?
Speaker 2: I played, yes, I seldom touch the violin right now, but talking about coming up at the right time.
Story_ID: 284075
Speaker 1: You know, when I went to Central Elementary School [Dayton, Ohio], there was a speech recital that the schools in Dayton [Ohio] participated in every year.  And they would award prizes and so on and so forth.  And when I entered Central Elementary School, my dad [George Pugh] got me permission to do that because it was integrated.  We lived in a neighbor where it was Garfield.  You remember Garfield Elementary School [Dayton, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: On 5th Street, right.
Speaker 1: Was not an integrated school racially.  It was all, it was all African American.  Teachers, all the students and you know, my father had inquired at the board of education before he moved to Dayton as to the situation with the school system and the board of education had told my dad that Dayton had an integrated school system.  But then when he moved to 5th and Mound Street, there was Garfield School, only about a block or so away and that's the school that I was supposed to go to and it was all black.  All faculty, all students, and so on.  And my father was so upset that, you know, that, you know, that was the situation after he was told that Dayton had integrated schools he went down to the board of education and complained about the fact that he was given incorrect information.  And because of this, they gave him permission to send me or to have me go to Central School which was down towards the town and was racially integrated.  So I never went to a segregated school in Dayton.  I went to Central School for grammar and then I went to Colonel White [High School; Thurgood Marshall High School, Dayton Ohio] for one year for the ninth grade, and then I went to Steele High School [Dayton, Ohio] for tenth, eleventh and twelfth grades.  You are sort of making a furrowed brown when I mentioned Colonel White?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I didn't know it existed as a high school then.
Speaker 1: Well, it was a junior high school.
Speaker 2: Junior high school.
Speaker 1: I did only ninth grade there, but you have heard of Colonel White and you know where it was located?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Colonel White was the rival school of Fairview [High School, Dayton, Ohio] where I went.
Speaker 1: That is correct.  It was way away from any African American neighborhood, but my father was so upset by all of this that he got permission for me to go to these integrated schools.  He said that was the main reason that he had left Kentucky to come to Ohio to begin with, was that I would have the advantage of good, of a good school education.
Speaker 2: Now there was a, seemed to be a rich tradition at [Paul Laurence] Dunbar High School [Paul Laurence Dunbar Early College High School, Dayton, Ohio] in Dayton.
Speaker 1: Oh, Dunbar was a very fine school actually and MacFarlane [Frederic C. MacFarlane] was the principal.  As a matter of fact, my father went out of his way to welcome Principal MacFarlane to Dayton when he came, but the point is that all of this planning for my education, had taken place before Dunbar was even built.
Speaker 2: No, you, so you started high school in Dayton, you came to, you started at Steele before Dunbar was opened, right?
Speaker 1: I started Steele High School the same year that Dunbar opened.
Speaker 2: And what year was that?
Speaker 1: Well I graduated from Steele in 1936 and I was at Steele for three years, so it had to be around 1933.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And from what I have read and heard from other people, Paul Laurence Dunbar's mother, Matilda [Murphy] Dunbar, was actually there.  She's still alive.
Speaker 1: Was what?  Was still alive?
Speaker 2: She was at the ceremony, yeah.  She was ninety-something years old (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That of course, I--
Speaker 2: --at the ceremony.
Speaker 1: That could be.  I couldn't dispute that.
Speaker 2: Other luminaries came to town to speak.  It was a really big deal.
Speaker 1: Oh yes, it certainly was, and MacFarlane, who was a very impressive principal, and the interesting thing is that my father went out of his way to welcome MacFarlane to Dayton, you know, when they had sort of receptions or whatever for this new principal.  And you know, he came from Gary, Indiana.  That's where MacFarlane came from to Dayton.  And so, the evening after the first day of school, MacFarlane called my father on the telephone, and said, "Well, what happened to [HistoryMaker] Roderick [Pugh]?"  Because of course, I didn't show up to go to Dunbar, and my father said, "Well, you know, he, he is going to Steele High" and MacFarlane is very, very disappointed.  And my father tried to give MacFarlane the background to all of this, and that I--not only that, but I also had my mind set on going to Steele High School, to an integrated school rather than to an, an all or segregated school.  And so finally, MacFarlane settled for this, but he was never happy about it.
Story_ID: 284076
Speaker 1: Now, sir, tell us this, now I, I think, you know, people my age have a view of what--who goes to high school and who doesn't, but in those days, did, were there numbers, substantial numbers of black youth in high school?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  As a matter of fact, now here again, I was essentially a kid.  My father [George Pugh] was a black professional, and many of his friends were black professionals, other M.D.s, pharmacists, business people and so on and so forth.  And all of my friends among these people, all of us, first of all we preferred integrated education because integrated education compared with what segregated education had been in the past.  Of course, it couldn't, there was no good comparison.  And so all of the, most the kids that I knew, not all of them, but most of the kids that I knew went to Steele [High School, Dayton, Ohio] or to Wilbur Wright [High School, Dayton, Ohio] or something.  There's another white high school there, rather than to Dunbar [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Early College High School, Dayton, Ohio], although I knew quite a number went to Dunbar too, and Dunbar turned out to be a very school, you know, it was segregated but it was a good school.
Speaker 1: Well, I just wondered when you were at Steele, for instance how many other black students were at Steele?
Speaker 2: Well, you could sort of count 'em on three hands, something like that.  There weren't that many black kids at Steele at the time, and one of the things I also can say is most of us who were at Steele were pretty good students.
Speaker 1: Now did they then, then where did the black students go before they had Dunbar High School?  Did they go to Wilbur Wright?  Where did they go?
Speaker 2: Well, I really don't know, but I think a lot of 'em came from Garfield [Elementary School, Dayton, Ohio] and other grammar schools which were in that general vicinity.
Speaker 1: I guess the question I'm asking is that we know there are a lot kids in grade school around there, but where did they go to high school if they didn't go to Steele or--
Speaker 2: I think most of them went to Dunbar, but if they were after--
Speaker 1: No, before Dunbar.
Speaker 2: Oh, before Dunbar?  They went to Roosevelt [High School, Dayton, Ohio]--
Speaker 1: Okay, we're gonna pause here.
Speaker 2: --on the 3rd--on 3rd Street.
Speaker 1: 3rd Street, yeah.
Story_ID: 284077
Speaker 1: So you attended Steele High School in Dayton [Ohio]?  Do you know, do you know who Steele High School was named for, 'cause I never knew?
Speaker 2: I have no idea who it was named for.
Speaker 1: It's spelled S-T-E-E-L-E, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.  I have no idea.
Speaker 1: And it was located in downtown Dayton.
Speaker 2: It was on Main [Street] and the [Miami] River.  Where was that?  Monument [Avenue], Main and Monument.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's right.  And there was a plaque in honor of Paul Laurence Dunbar in the main hallway of Steele High School when I was there.
Speaker 1: Now, that's interesting too then, to mention because I know all through my school days in Dayton and though there--Dayton was a very segregated city when I was growing up and race relations weren't that great (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well you're not older than I.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  The city lionized Paul Robeson, I mean, Paul Dunbar, Paul Laurence Dunbar.
Speaker 2: The city what?
Speaker 1: Lionized him.  They, he was a hero.
Speaker 2: Well he's one of the most famous citizens of Dayton.
Speaker 1: Right.  And I think--
Speaker 2: Even today.
Speaker 1: Right.  But--
Speaker 2: He and the Wright Brothers [Orville Wright and Wilbur Wright], you know, you think of the Wright Brothers and you think Paul Laurence Dunbar.
Speaker 1: I think the years have diminished the memory of Dunbar, you know, while people still know who the Wright Brothers are, but I think the average person now, a lot of people don't know who Dunbar is.
Speaker 2: Well, that is true.
Speaker 1: Though they know the name of the school [Paul Laurence Dunbar Early College High School, Dayton, Ohio] is Dunbar.
Speaker 2: But you know why that is though?
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Because, since Dunbar, so many African Americans have become fantastic writers, poets, musicians, you name it, and I think that is the principal reason.  If you really know Dunbar's work and so on and so forth, I can still appreciate what he accomplished and particularly, when he accomplished it, yeah, so, but Dunbar today just, the competition is just tremendous, and of course, in his very day the competition wasn't really that bad.  I mean he, he didn't have to compete with other African Americans writing poetry and so on and so forth.
Speaker 1: He was the poet in some ways of those days (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 284078
Speaker 1: You went to Central Elementary School [Dayton, Ohio], and then to Steele High School [Dayton, Ohio], and they were both in downtown--
Speaker 2: Well I went to, then I went to Colonel White [High School; Thurgood Marshall High School, Dayton, Ohio] for junior high school for one year, the ninth grade, and then I went to Steele for tenth, eleventh and twelfth.  Steele didn't have the ninth grade by that time.  It was the, what do they call it, the system.  It was the sixth, it was called the six, three, three system, but at the time that they enacted the system I had gone to as far as the eighth grade at Central School, and so I needed to get the ninth grade somewhere before I could get to Steele, and so I went to Colonel White which was way, sort of out of everybody's neighborhood, but since I needed the one class, the board of education let me go out there.
Speaker 1: Now Colonel White High School?
Speaker 2: It was a junior high school at the time.
Speaker 1: Even as a junior high school even.
Speaker 2: It's now a high school.
Speaker 1: Even when I'm growing up and it's over, it's a lot of years separating you and I, but, thirty years at least, but Colonel White High School is located in a neighborhood where the mothers and grandmothers and aunts and most black kids, would go do day work.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: And so there weren't many kids your age in that neighborhood.  How did that--
Speaker 2: There were no African Americans that I knew of who were living within that school district.  And I was able to get out there because I had permission to go.  I had only this one year to make up before going to Steele so they let me go into Colonel White to do the ninth grade.
Speaker 1: I'm just curious, how were you treated and what did you learn in an atmosphere like that that you may not of--
Speaker 2: First of all, let me tell you something.  My family and I were basically interested in the quality of the education, period.  And if I could go to the classes and do my homework and not speak to anybody, it didn't bother me that much.  I was interested in getting the best possible education that I could.  And the year that I spent at Colonel White, that's essentially what happened.  I went to classes, I did my work and I would nod and say hello to a few of the kids and so on and so forth, but I made no reasonably good friends the year I was at Colonel White at all.  I can't even remember a single fellow student by name from the year that I spent at Colonel White.  But, I must also say I was treated grade-wise, academically, I was treated very fairly, and so I had always been an interested student and my grades held at Colonel White just like they had always held, and, but I was very happy to get over that one year (laughter) because there were only about three or four black kids in the whole school.
Story_ID: 284079
Speaker 1: Tell us about, you know, at Steele High School [Dayton, Ohio] you were, you were saying--we were talking about this off camera, you made the National Honor Society.
Speaker 2: The first African American kid to do that.  And at the same time, I played in the Steele High School orchestra.  I played the violin.  And, in my senior year, I was also first chair violinist, and the first chair violin, of course, was always a very special seat in a symphony orchestra because the first chair violinist exercises a certain kind of leadership and, as a matter of fact, when I was at Steele and the first chair, whenever the faculty instructor was not there to direct a piece of music, I was the one who directed.  I was the assistant director as well in that situation.
Speaker 1: Now this is no mean feat because I've, I, having been raised in that part of the country, you know, Howard Cosell called that area the Rhineland of America.  Lots of German music teachers and a real strict music discipline in that area, Cleveland Symphony [Cleveland Orchestra] being the top in the country in those days.  How, I mean I'm just trying to set the stage for this.  This wasn't just a lightweight accomplishment.
Speaker 2: Well, that's right.  Well, the thing about it is I was in that position only my senior year.  And the reason, there was a very good reason by the way.  When I joined the, when I became a student at Steele, I was a sophomore and there was a young lady who was already in Steele High orchestra, golly, I used to know her name, but her name is not coming right now.  Anyway, she was fantastic.  She was an excellent violinist and she was a first chair violinist and she deserved it.  She was a year ahead of me and I did not become first chair until after she had graduated and it so happened that the violin section wasn't all that strong and, however, there was seemingly no hesitation on the part of the music director in appointing me as first chair violinist for that one year.  Well that was my senior year, so it was just one year that I was the first chair violinist and I was delighted because it was quite an honor, and, of course, I worked very, very hard to deserve the honor, and things went extremely well.  I think there was only one time when the faculty member was absent from a rehearsal and it fell upon me to direct the rehearsal.  I enjoyed that very much.
Speaker 1: Now did, how did people respond to you?  I mean did they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Very well, very well.  Oh, another thing, yes, let me tell you about Steele High and the orchestra.  When MacFarlane [Frederic C. MacFarlane] came from Gary [Indiana] to Dayton [Ohio]--
Speaker 1: --to become the principal of Dunbar [Paul Laurence Dunbar High School; Paul Laurence Dunbar Early College High School, Dayton, Ohio].
Speaker 2: --to become the principal of Dunbar, a guy, a young black guy who played the clarinet came from Gary with him.  Did you know that?  And the interesting thing is that this student from Gary, Indiana, who came with MacFarlane to Dayton did not go to Dunbar High School, he went to Steele High, and so the last couple of years that I was at Steele, or it could have been all three years, he and I were the two African American kids in the Steele High School orchestra.  He was, he was fantastic, fantastic musician.
Speaker 1: Do you remember his name and what he did later?
Speaker 2: You know, right at the moment, I can't think of his name, but if I think of it I'll let you, I'll let you know later, but let's see, what was his name?
Speaker 1: Well, just, you can get it later.
Story_ID: 284080
Speaker 1: When you were in high school, what was your social life like?  I know there was a--
Speaker 2: Oh well, my social life was totally different from my high school experience.  You know, education was one thing, the rest of my life was another.  The rest of my life was totally, was all on the west side with my African American friends.  I made one good friend while I was at Steele High School [Dayton, Ohio], white, that is.  And his mother and father were very sort of religious kinds of people and they were promoting racial acceptance and integration and so on and so forth, and he happened to have been in, I think in the Steele High School orchestra then, but he was the only white kid that I became very good friends of, and, you know, the rest, even though I was going to Steele High School, my good friends otherwise were all African Americans (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you remember the young white man's name, or white kid's name?
Speaker 2: It may come to me in a few minutes, but right now, it's--
Speaker 1: Well, who were your friends in the black community and what did you all do?  I know there was a Classic Theater, the Palace [Theater, Dayton, Ohio], I don't know, just tell me about what went on over there.
Speaker 2: We went to the Classic, we went to the Palace.
Speaker 1: The Classic, you know, was built by a black, couple of black men, Goodrich Giles and [Carl] Anderson.
Speaker 2: We had had a wonderful social circle.  And our social circle was totally supported by our parents, and people had birthday parties and primarily ran into your African American friends on weekends when school was out, and particularly when you went to church on Sunday.  And then, you know, the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church had a strong connection with Wilberforce University [Wilberforce, Ohio] and we used to have Sunday school conferences in the summer at Wilberforce.  And I'd go to Wilberforce every summer, and the kids who would come to those, at least A.M.E. summer meetings, were all African Americans and they were from various and sundry schools.
Speaker 1: Now did you participate and were they having the tennis camps in Wilberforce in those days?  I know they did have these tennis camps that were intended, maybe later (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was before, before stuff like that came out I think.  Now I played tennis in high school, but not in connection with anything like that--
Story_ID: 284081
Speaker 1: Also I learned to swim, guess where, at the Y [Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA)] on 5th Street in Dayton [Ohio]--
Speaker 2: That's right, the 5th Street Y (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's where I learned how to swim, that's right.
Speaker 2: That right down, it's a hop, skip and jump to the Palace [Theater, Dayton, Ohio], I mean the Classic [Theater, Dayton, Ohio] and the Palace, and--
Speaker 1: Listen, let me also tell you something else about the swimming.  You know I told you that when we first came to Dayton my father [George Pugh] rented space on the second floor of this building that was right across the street from Cox's Drugstore [Dayton, Ohio], and right next door to the Y.  My mother [Lena White Pugh] was the kind of person, she was always somewhat concerned about my being exposed to anything that potentially might be dangerous, and the, on the ground level, the windows aligned the swimming pool there, were fixed in such a way if you were walking on the ground you couldn't look into the swimming pools through the windows, but in the summertime when it was warm, they would lower the upper window panes and still if you were walking you couldn't look in.  My mother was so concerned about my safety, particularly when I was just learning how to swim, that she could look down into the damn swimming pool from our residence on the second floor of this building right next door to the Y and it's always made me chuckle, and when I go to Dayton now, and pass that neighborhood, I always think about the fact that my mother, particularly when I was just learning how to swim, would stand there at the window monitoring how well I was progressing.  And, another thing, you know, about the regulation of swimming in the pool in those days, you had to swim nude.
Speaker 2: I've heard about that, I've heard about that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right.  We were not allowed to even wear swim trunks.  Everybody in this pool was nude, and I'd never heard of a situation like that before, but that's the way it was, and finally people came to accept it, but that was one of the reasons that it was an embarrassment for me that my mother had to monitor what was going on because if I could look up and see her looking out of her window, so the other kids could do the same thing.  But, you know, we told her.  You ever hear of Mr. [A.W.] Payne?  He was a scoutmaster in those days.  Well anyway, he had a great deal to do with supervising what was going on at the Y, and so, you know, I called his attention to the fact that, you know, when you lower those windows my mother can look down into the swimming pool.  But there was nothing really done about it, so I finally accepted it and all the rest of the kids accepted it.
Speaker 2: I don't know if you knew a Mr. McGill [ph.] who taught swimming there.
Speaker 1: Who?
Speaker 2: McGill.
Speaker 1: McGill?  I don't remember that name.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was somebody who was there when I was coming along.  Did you remember the Linden Center [Linden Community and Recreation Center, Dayton, Ohio]?
Speaker 1: Oh, absolutely.  I learned how to play tennis over there.  That's the main thing I remember about the Linden Center.  They have tennis courts.
Speaker 2: I know there's a old YWCA, big Victorian kind of building.
Speaker 1: And my mother was related very much to the YW.  As a matter of fact, she was on the board of the YW, and at one time, I think was secretary of the board.
Story_ID: 284082
Speaker 1: In high school [Steele High School, Dayton, Ohio], so your social life was on the west side of Dayton [Ohio].
Speaker 2: Absolutely, exclusively.
Speaker 1: On the west side of the Miami River.  When you were, you're on a National Honor Society in high school, I mean, you did, did the school counsel you about where to go to college or anything?  Did they have anything to do with, ever say anything about it?
Speaker 2: They did not need to counsel me about where to go to college.  I think my parents [Lena White Pugh and George Pugh] would have been insulted had they even attempted to do that.  No, I think they realized that I didn't really need that kind of, after all my father is a physician, and so my goal had been set on Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee] from almost the time I came out of the womb, because my mother was from Nashville [Tennessee] and, you know, she admired Fisk, and I think had she been able to afford Fisk, she probably would have gone to Fisk.
Speaker 1: Just a couple of things before we leave high school.  Who were some of your favorite teachers?  Did you have any favorite teachers in high school and can you remember their names?
Speaker 2: I had, essentially, it's very difficult for me to remember the names right now.  One was [Mary] Alice Hunter.  She specialized in history and she was a pretty nice person.  At the present time, I can't even recall the name of the orchestra conductor who was pretty good.  He was, I think he was a very good orchestral conductor, and then I think it was a Mr. Hoffman [ph.], but I'm not sure, who was a faculty person who supported me in terms of my being elected to the National Honor Society.  But by this time, most of those names, at the same time, however, I can visually remember what these people look like.
Speaker 1: Now what about in the black community.  I know the community was close-knit and those things.  Who were some of the friends--?
Speaker 2: Prominent people in the black community?
Speaker 1: Yeah, friends of your father and the people that--
Speaker 2: Oh, well, first of all immediately next door to us after we moved to this one construction, structure, rather, where we can have the residents and the, my father's office together on the ground floor and then we had another space on the second floor.  But we, our residence was next to the Shaws who had the cleaning establishment, okay, they were good friends of ours.  And right further down the block, there was another black business and you know what that black business was?  Loritts Funeral Home [Loritts-Neilson Funeral Home, Dayton, Ohio].
Speaker 1: H.P. Loritts.
Speaker 2: That is correct.  And, so, Loritts and my parents were, as a matter of fact, you know, Loritts also belong to Wayman [Chapel] A.M.E. Church [Dayton, Ohio], which was my mother's church.  And also so did the Shaws.  The Shaws belonged to Wayman also.
Speaker 1: Did you know the McLins?
Speaker 2: Knew them, but didn't know them as well as I knew Loritts and Shaw.  And they opened up some years after both of the, both of these other businesses had opened.  There was another physician who was a very good friend of my dad.  I'm trying to think of his name now.  His name--then there was a Dr. Clark.  You remember Dr. Clark who had an office on, what is this other through street?
Speaker 1: 3rd Street, 5th Street.
Speaker 2: No, no, it was going the other way.
Speaker 1: Broadway and Western [Avenue; James H. McGee Boulevard], Broadway.
Speaker 2: Germantown.
Speaker 1: Germantown.
Speaker 2: Ah hah.  Dr. Clark, who had an office on Germantown, was a very good friend of my dad and the two families were very good friends.
Speaker 1: Oh, I know from my parents that Dr. [Washington] Rowan was a, he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Dr. Rowan and my father were very good friends, that's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  He was a Garveyite, I think, very much into [Marcus] Garvey.
Speaker 2: I didn't know Dr. Rowan that well myself, but he and my father were quite good friends, and, of course, Rowan, Rowan's office was on 5th Street also.  And Rowan had a couple of sons.  I knew his sons because they used to come over to the house and we'd play checkers and do stuff like that, you know, and his sons were both very philosophical and they would come with all kinds of far-fetched philosophical notions and so on and so forth.  That always seemed a bit strange to me at that particular point, but I enjoyed them.  And because, at least they were intellectual, and I tended to be a bit intellectual myself at that stage of the game (laughter).
Story_ID: 284083
Speaker 1: When you graduated from high school [Steele High School, Dayton, Ohio], you knew you were going to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] and so how was, had you been to Fisk before or was it your first time going to Nashville [Tennessee] (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I think maybe the first time I heard the word Fisk I was coming out of the womb (laughter).  There was just no other place that was ever mentioned, sort of as to where I should go to college.
Speaker 1: This is like, you graduated from high school in 19--.
Speaker 2: Thirty-six [1936].
Speaker 1: Thiryt-six [1936].  You started at Fisk that fall I take it?
Speaker 2: That is correct, and not only that, but, you know my father [George Pugh] talked about Fisk, you know, although he had never been to Fisk.  He went to Meharry [Meharry Medical Department of Central Tennessee College; Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] and Meharry is right across the street from Fisk.  You know Fisk has always had a fantastic reputation.  My mother [Lena White Pugh] talked about Fisk and the way she, she graduated from Pearl High [School; Pearl-Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School, Nashville, Tennessee], which is only a few blocks from Fisk, but my mother, you know there was not that kind of pressure on, particularly females, to go to college, but particularly if they could marry an M.D.  So my mother had no reason to really to want to go to Fisk because as soon as she got out of high school just about, she married my dad, who had just graduated from Meharry.  So why did she need to go to Fisk?  But both of my parents, from the time I was knee-high to adult, talked about Fisk.  And then I happened to meet some Fisk people, some graduates, and I was taken with it, and it was a fantastic experience.
Speaker 1: Now, when you were there, was Charles Spurgeon Johnson the president?
Speaker 2: That is correct.  I was there from 1936 to 1940.  Now Johnson, who later became president of Fisk, at the time I was there, he was chairman of the sociology department.
Speaker 1: So he wasn't even the president yet?
Speaker 2: Oh no, but he was the department chair, and he, Charles S. Johnson became president of Fisk a number of years after I graduated.  But, from all I can understand, his presidency was a reasonably successful one.  You know, the big challenge then, as well as now, for your historically black colleges [HBCUs], is what?  Money.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And you have to, you know, be a successful fundraiser.
Speaker 1: Now was, who else, was Arna Bontemps there then?  Was he the librarian at Fisk at the (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I believe he was, I think yeah, he was the librarian [sic.].  St. Elmo Brady was chairman of the chemistry department.
Speaker 1: St. Elmo Brady?
Speaker 2: St. Elmo Brady.
Story_ID: 284084
Speaker 1: You know my undergraduate major was chemistry.  And that's because, you see, I wanted to major in psychology, but they didn't have a psych major at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], and when we were standing there at the registrar's desk when we were, when I was first registering, my father [George Pugh] had gone down to Fisk with me, and, of course, my dad thought that I was crazy by thinking about becoming a psychologist when I could easily study medicine and go into psychiatry.  And so--
Speaker 2: What were you thinking then on that and how did you get interested in studying the mind in the first place?
Speaker 1: Well, I told you about this little experiment I did with this child.  That was the first that I, you see, understand psychology is the study of human behavior.  That's what it is.  And now, of course, we refer to psychology as the science, thank you, of human behavior.  And it is.  It's based upon scientific methodology today.  It's not sort of a fly-by-night, whatever.  I was never interested in studying medicine.  And I suppose that was something that my father couldn't understand in that he loved medicine.  He really loved medicine.  And, so I knew that Fisk did not have a major in psychology.  I knew that when I registered, but I heard so much about Fisk University that I just really wanted to go to Fisk, and I don't regret that I did that, so when Mary D. Shane who was a graduate of Pearl High [School; Pearl-Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School, Nashville, Tennessee].  She was the registrar, came up to my dad and me, we were standing at the desk, and she looks at me and she says, "Well, young man, what do you choose to major in?"  My father said, "Pre-med."
Speaker 2: She was talking to the young man, right, not--?
Speaker 1: Well, anyway, I said to Ms. Shane, I said, "Well, you know, I know that you do not have a major in psychology here.  I said that's what I'd really like to major in.  But my dad, he says if I'm interested in this, I should study medicine and go into psychiatry, and I don't feel that I need to spend four years of my life getting an M.D. degree so that then maybe I can begin to do what I'm really interested in, and that is working with people who have problems, you know, and adjustment and so on and so forth."  So she said something to the effect, oh yeah, when she said, "What are you going to major in?" my father said "Pre-med," and then she looked at me and I said, "Well I really want to major in psychology but you don't have a psych major here."  That was the thing that really saved the day, and I said so, okay, I'll take pre-med.  So what majors, what subjects do I have to finish?  She ran down a whole list of subjects, including chemistry and I said, "Make it chemistry."  And this is why my degree to this day from Fisk University reads B.A., chemistry, and I have to look at the diploma and laugh about it, but now, let me tell you how faith is with me.  Sometimes when I look back on my life, it is absolutely amazing some of the things that have happened.  So I took this chem major at Fisk, but I minored in psychology.  They did have a minor in psychology, okay?  And when I graduated from Fisk, I followed my path, not my father's.  He wanted me to go across the street to Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee].  And I said no, I am going to become a psychologist, and I've decided that since Fisk was a fairly expensive place that I will go to Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] which was a state school, and do a master's degree and that'll ease up the financial strain and you and my mom [Lena White Pugh].  But anyway when he found out that I was determined not to become an M.D. or psychiatrist, he went along with the program, so I went to Ohio State.  Now, interestingly, Ohio State required all entrants to do an entrance exam.  So I had a bachelors' degree so I was, you know, registering to do a master's degree, but I had to take the entrance exam.  And I'll tell you I have never run into such a coincidence in my life.  I never saw an entrance exam with so many chemistry questions in it.  I scored at the 100th percentile on Ohio State University's entrance exam, and, of course, here is this black kid from Fisk University, taking the entrance exam.  He's going to major in psychology and he scores at the 100th percentile in our entrance exam and that is only because I majored in chemistry at Fisk.  I never saw an entrance exam with so much chemistry in it.  And some of the kids were sitting there scratching their heads and so on.  I felt sorry for them because I knew what they were scratching their heads about.  But I had just gotten a degree in chemistry.
Story_ID: 284185
Speaker 1: Your mentor at [The] Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] was Carl Rogers, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Tell us a bit about him and then maybe we'll pick up, you know, B.F. Skinner's influence, but tell us about Carl Rogers.
Speaker 2: Well, Carl Rogers and B.F. Skinner both were innovators in their particular areas of emphasis.  Were you asking me about Carl Rogers?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  Well, Carl Rogers is primarily noted for his, what was an innovation at the time, known as non-directive psychotherapy.  And he emphasized the importance of relating to your clients if you're a psychotherapist and someone has come to you for psychological help.  He emphasized the importance of relating to your clients with unconditional positive regard for them as human beings.  And his theory, his idea was, that you were to essentially facilitate that person's quest in finally solving and resolving his or her own problems.  And it's called, excuse me, his approach is called, originally it was called non-directive psychotherapy.  Now I have a great deal of respect for Carl Rogers, as a psychologist, as a theoretician, and so on and so forth, but my own approach to doing psychotherapy is not totally Rogerian, and hasn't been for a long time.  Now, the whole business of unconditional privacy in regard for the client is absolutely fundamental, I think.  But, in terms of helping people resolve problems, you're also helping them to change their behavior and therefore I am very partial to the ideas of B.F. Skinner when it comes to that, because B.F. Skinner was primarily known as a behaviorist, and his theories are directly beamed at how do you help people change their behavior, and that's what psychotherapy really is all about.  It's behavior change process and the challenge is how do you relate to the individual who needs this kind of assistance, how do you relate to them in such a way as to best facilitate their achieving the behavior change that they want.
Story_ID: 284186
Speaker 1: You finished a master's degree in a year, one year, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now this must have been a really a packed year because before--
Speaker 2: Oh, that's all I did (laughter).
Speaker 1: --you had some psychology at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], but this is--
Speaker 2: Well, I took all the psychology they offered at Fisk, the only thing about it is that I got a psych minor at Fisk, but they didn't have psych major.  Oh, yeah, so once I went to [The] Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio], with all I was taking was psychology, of course, by that time.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, at the time, I mean one would just be tempted to think that you were, as you heard, the Rogerian theories and the study of B.F. Skinner that you were thinking about, how, you know, these theories can apply to the problems of the 20th century, of 20th century America.
Speaker 2: Let me tell you something else, and I'll be very frank with you about my being at Ohio State and what I did.  I wanted to get a master's degree in psychology at Ohio State and that's all that I really wanted to achieve that year at Ohio State.  I looked at the, at the outline of courses that one had to take in order to do that and I set my mind on doing exactly that.  I wanted to get a master's degree in psychology and I was not necessarily majoring in psychotherapy at that particular point, see.  And, as a matter of fact, at that stage of the game, I had practically no training in psychotherapy per se.  We would have some, maybe some sort of informal kinds of seminars where we'd meet with [Carl] Rogers and we'd talk about it and so on and so forth, but during my year at Ohio State, I think I might have had only about one, maybe no more than two courses that really focused on psychotherapy per se.  But the courses primarily focused on psychology as a discipline and so on and so forth.  So, it was not until I did my work at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] that the focus of my training at Chicago was psychotherapy.  And Carl Rogers by that time was on the faculty of Chicago and that's why I followed him to Chicago after I got out of the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 1: Okay, now the next, I guess our next chapter is, well, at Ohio State, let's pick up on a little bit of the social dynamics of being at Ohio State (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ohio State?
Speaker 1: Were you, did you stay on campus at Ohio State?
Speaker 2: No, because they didn't particularly encourage black folks to stay on campus.  I stayed on, I wish, it's been so long ago, there was a street very close to Ohio State's campus where a whole lot of black kids rented rooms, and there were obviously people who purchased these houses and so on just for that kind of income and I stayed in a house, I had a room in a house where all of us were African American students at Ohio State and each of us had his or her own room in the house.  I think it was all men at the time, at this particular stage of the game, but there was an owner of this house who came around every month to collect the rent from all of us.  So this is essentially how we lived.  There were very few African Americans living on campus because in those days in that regard, Ohio State wasn't all that liberal, and as a matter of fact, the restaurants around the campus tried to avoid serving African American students if they could.  For example, I went into a Chinese restaurant right off the campus of Ohio State while I was a student there.  I noticed this restaurant for a long time.  I'd never talked about, talked with anybody about going to the restaurant.  One day I was sort of in a hurry during lunch time and I said, I think I'll go into this Chinese restaurant just to see what happens.  And by the way, I had looked in the restaurant passing by from time to time. I had never seen a black person in the restaurant.  So I went into the restaurant, sat down at a table that was not occupied otherwise, and I sat there for a few minutes and finally a Chinese young man came up to me speaking in Chinese.  He talked to me.  I had no idea in the world what he was saying.  He could have been cursing me out as far as I'm concerned but he was talking in Chinese and I would, you know, respond in English.  I said I don't understand what you're saying, and so blah, blah, blah, blah.  He continued to talk to me in Chinese to the point that eventually I got the message and I said thank you, and I got up and walked out.  But that was right across the street from Ohio State University at the time, 1941.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I'm sure it's not like that now, but that's the way it was then.
Story_ID: 284187
Speaker 1: Okay, so at the end of that year, now did you go, did you go to University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] immediately or did the war [World War II, WWII]--?
Speaker 2: Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no I'll tell you what happened.  At the end of the year when I got my master's [degree] in psychology, I decided that I at long last wanted to become my own man and to relieve my parents [Lena White Pugh and George Pugh] of this financial strain that my parents never complained to me about the financial strain of my education, but I became increasingly aware of the fact, you know, kid, you're getting all these money from your parents and sending you Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] and [The] Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] and so on, it's about time you start standing on your own two feet.  So that's really what, what I wanted to do so after I got a master's, I decided I was going to liberate my parents, and I did.  And my parents have never had to give me a penny since, of course, otherwise in Christmas presents and stuff like that, but that was a good thing.  And so I went to the library and got a list of all of the historically black colleges [HBCUs] that were in existence at that time, and I sent a resume about my experience and background to every single one of them, except Fisk.  I didn't send one to Fisk.  And I got a positive response from only one.  Albany State College [Albany State University], Albany, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Now that's strange because you had your record, your academic record was pretty good.
Speaker 2: Yes, but the point is I had only a master's degree now, okay.  And by that time, your historically black colleges were moving up and they, very few of them were particularly full-fledged universities, like Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] and Fisk, maybe Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and such, they weren't interesting in hiring somebody on the faculty with only a master's degree.  So that's, I was not necessarily surprised about that.  Albany State College was a small sort of two by four educational institution and I'll tell you how two by four it was.  The president of Albany State at the time, his name was J.W. Holley and so, I'd gotten the name of the school out of some volume, index of institute of higher learning, African American, of course, and so he sent a telegram, "Come at once."  I think it was the school was about to open and so on and so forth, and I was jumping around that house, you know.  I was so happy that I had finally been asked to come and join the faculty of a college.  So I take the L&N [Railroad, Louisville and Nashville Railroad] south from Dayton [Ohio] and end up in Albany, Georgia, and go out to the school.  And asked to be shown to the president's office.  So I knock on the door.  He says, "Come in," and I open the door and I said, "My name is [HistoryMaker] Roderick Pugh" and Dr. Holley immediately says, "Oh, Professor Pugh, we are so delighted--" and I said to myself, "Professor?"  I couldn't believe this.  He was referring to me as Professor Pugh and I had never taught a day in my life at the college level, and then he offered me a seat and we started talking, and he says, "Now, I'm so happy you were able to come because we have a vacancy in our science department."  I said, "Your science department?" I said, "Dr. Holley I just got a master's degree in psychology from Ohio State."  He says, "Well, you have a bachelor's degree in chemistry from Fisk, don't you?  Your record says that."  And I said, "Well, yes, I have a bachelor's degree in chemistry from Fisk."  He said then, "Well go downstairs and teach the science then."  So when he said go downstairs, he meant to the basement.  The science department at Albany State was located in the basement of the building where his office was located.  So I go downstairs to meet the one guy, the other guy who was in the science department, and he had a master's degree in biology, but Holley had refused to appoint him as chairman of the science department.  He and Holley didn't get along well with each other.  So, okay, Holley sends me, he says go downstairs and teach that chemistry.  And I get downstairs and this guy who had been there for several years and had, had his falling out with J.W. Holley, hardly wants to speak to me (laughter), simply because of the fact that he didn't like what Holley was doing and so on and so forth--
Story_ID: 284188
Speaker 1: I spent two years at Albany State College [Albany State University, Albany, Georgia] and I think it was near the end of the first year, or something like that, that's when the Japanese dropped the bomb on Pearl Harbor [Naval Station Pearl Harbor, Hawaii], and so, at the end, by the end of my second year at Albany State College, I got a nice letter from Uncle Sam, who invited me to join the [U.S.] Armed Forces and so I left Albany State College and joined the United States Army for World War II [WWII].
Speaker 2: Okay, so this is 1942?
Speaker 1: Let me see what year was this.
Speaker 2: Pearl Harbor was '41 [1941] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That was '42 [1942] then, yeah, '42 [1942].
Speaker 2: In 1942.
Speaker 1: Yeah, because as a matter of fact I, I believe I was discharged from the service in '45 [1945].
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.  So you were a drafted, the man who's been drafted with no military training.  You came in as a private right?
Speaker 1: Absolutely.  Buck ass private, and this is really, really a new experience, you know.  And, I don't know how much of this you, how much more time do we have?
Speaker 2: Oh, we've got time (unclear).
Speaker 1: Well, I ran into a very strange situation when I was driving to the service.  You know, my hometown was Dayton, Ohio, so I was really drafted from Dayton, Ohio, and when we got to the, to the station where we were all supposed to report, there was a long line and there was a guy we were all approaching this particular guy, and he would point at you and say, Army, Navy, whatever, you know, and so that's where you supposed to go.  So I got up to him and he said, Navy, and I said, "Sir, please not the [U.S.] Navy.  I've heard too many bad things about the Navy as far as African Americans are concerned.  If there's any way possible, please let me go into the Army."  And he said, "Okay," and Army.  This is how I got into the Army.
Story_ID: 284189
Speaker 1: And I was sent out to Fort Lewis, Washington.  And, when I got out to Fort Lewis, Washington, and of course, you have to make, fill out papers indicating your education, where you got education, all your background employment and all that sort of business, so I got out in Fort Lewis, Washington, and for several days I didn't have any particular assignment other than to take the stick with the pinpoint on it and go around and clean up the yard and all that sort of business.  So, there I was with my pinpointed stick, a buck ass private, doing that kind of thing.  And after a couple of days, the guy came running up to me, he says, "Pugh [HistoryMaker Roderick Pugh], the adjutant wants to see you in headquarters."  I said, "What for?"  He says, "I don't know, but he wants you to come to headquarters right away."  And I said to myself, I said, "Oh God, what the hell is this all about?"  It so happened that the guy had had a chance to take a look at my army records and all that sort of business, educational records, and he decided he wanted me to be a clerk in headquarters of, of the outfit, and then he said, "I see you have a master's degree from [The] Ohio State University [Columbus, Ohio]?"  I said, "Yes I do."  He said, "What happened at commencement in 1941 when you got your master's degree at Ohio State?"  He says, at the commencement.  You know, that's a strange question, but I said, "Well, come to think of it, we were all lined up to march into the stadium for the commencement exercises and the heavens opened up and it started raining torrents, and somebody announced on the loud speaker that the commencement had been called off and they would mail our diplomas to us and we would receive our diplomas by mail."  And the guy was just looking with no expression on his face and after I said that tale, he says, "Well, that's interesting." He says, "I want you to know that I got my bachelor's degree that same day that you got your master's degree."  This is a white guy.  And he then assigned me to a clerk's position in his headquarters all through Sunday under him.  That was my introduction to the [U.S.] Army at Fort Lewis, Washington.
Speaker 2: How did it go, how did it go (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) His name was James Ike Wick [ph.].  Naturally, I will never forget that as long as I live.  And it was really pretty rough.  By the way, you know, this book of mine that I put out ['Psychology and the Black Experience,' Roderick W. Pugh], has a chapter six which is the entire history of my Army career, and you read that chapter six so you'll get the answers to the questions that you just asked.  But it was not easy.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: It was not easy.  You know I said, how in the heck could I find myself in a situation where this guy resents what I had accomplished at Ohio State at the same time that he was there as a student too, you know.  But in the long run, it all worked out.
Story_ID: 284190
Speaker 1: So you were shipped out of, out of Washington to England at first, I think, right?  Did you go to England first (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We, we were shipped out of Fort Lewis, Washington and, yeah, we went all over across the United States by rail to New York City [New York, New York], and in New York, we stayed there for two or three days, enough to take, have a pass for a night or two in New York, and that was the highpoint of my initiation into the [U.S.] Army.  But then, I think about the third night were there, we were ordered to report at the docks with all of our equipment at such and such time and blah, blah, blah, blah.  And when I arrived there, I looked up at the boat and it seemed endless.  It was the tallest boat I'd ever seen and certainly the longest boat I'd ever seen, and I, you know, all of us said, "What the hell is this that we're gonna have to get on?"  It was only the Queen Elizabeth which was the largest vessel in creation at that particular point that had been turned into a troop ship, and that's the ship that I crossed the Atlantic [Ocean] for, and of course, it took us to England.  And then after we got to England, then we were broken up into smaller groups, and I ended up in Northern Ireland.
Speaker 1: Now what was the name of your unit, I mean, your group?
Speaker 2: Well, it's in my book ['Psychology and the Black Experience,' Roderick W. Pugh].  Let me see if I can, it depends upon which unit you're talking about.
Speaker 1: I guess the major, the place where you spent the most time that you felt was your, you know--
Speaker 2: Well, I suppose it would be the 3511 Quartermaster Truck Company, but, if I just had a copy of my book here I could, I could tell you that.  But if you look into a copy of my book, chapter six, you'll find all that information.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So you went from England to Northern Ireland to--
Speaker 2: And then from Northern Ireland, now by the way, Southern Ireland was not involved in World War II [WWII].  They were Catholic and they opted out and fortunately, by the way, I was, I was in, you know, the United States Army was segregated, World War II.  So I was in an all-black outfit, other than the top officers.  Usually the top officers were white, but all the other young men in the outfit were African American, and fortunately, my outfit ended up in Northern Ireland and the northern Irish were some of the most hospitable and eager people to do the best that they could for us that I have ever run into.  There was one thing, however, whenever you met a northern Irish person, and, of course, we all were, they knew that we were soldiers, we were in the United States Army, we were in uniform and everything like that, so they knew that.  But they, one of the first things they would say is, "Are you Protestant?"  And, of course, I'm Protestant, and most of African Americans, at that time, the great bulk, were Protestant.  And once we said we were Protestants, they embraced us.  You know why that was?  Southern Ireland, which is Catholic, was not involved in World War II.  They opted out and, of course, there was a big friction between Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland.
Story_ID: 284191
Speaker 1: Were you a part of any organizing efforts to end segregation in the--
Speaker 2: In the [U.S.] Army?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: There was no such thing.  Now, I'll tell you how I fought it, and for myself, essentially, fought it successfully.  And that is, first of all, doing a jam-up job, anything I was assigned to do, and, of course, I had a master's degree at that time, all right.  And finally, we were in, black soldiers were in an outfit, and we were having a lot of problems with, but we were trying to do the best that we could, and we, we were in Europe now and, as a matter of fact, they were on the, we were in France I believe, at the time this happened, but this is all in that book of mine ['Psychology and the Black Experience,' Roderick W. Pugh].  It was announced that we were going to be visited by the I.G.  In the Army, I.G. stands for inspector general, and army regulations stipulate that whenever an inspector general visits an outfit, any many in that outfit has the privilege of requesting an interview with the I.G. to discuss any problems whatsoever that that member of the Army might feel it was worth reporting to him.  And, so, sure we ran into a lot of racial segregation and prejudice and so on and so forth.  But by the time we got to the, where were we, we were in, we were in Northern Ireland at the time this happened, and we were announced, it was announced that we were going have a visit by the I.G., and some of the guys, not, I wasn't in on the initiation of this, some of the guys wanted to organize a 100 percent request on the part of the African American kids to speak to the inspector general about the kinds of experiences that we were having.  And to try and make an impression, you know, to get something done, to have some alleviation of all of this.  And so at that time I was, I think a staff sergeant or something like that.  I had moved up the ranks rather nicely in the Army and I think I was the fourth ranking non-commissioned officer in the outfit.  So they came to me and they said, "Pugh [HistoryMaker Roderick Pugh], the I.G. is gonna come in and we're trying to organize a 100 percent request for interviews with the I.G. to see if we can maybe through that method, straighten out some of this mess, you know, that we had to put up with."  He says, "Are you gonna be with us?"  And I said, "Sure, I'm gonna be with you."
Story_ID: 284092
Speaker 1: They were trying to get you to sign on to this petition for this meeting with the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, the inspector general--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --was coming, yes okay.
Speaker 1: And you said that, did you say yes or no?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I had, I thought I had my copy of this book ['Psychology and the Black Experience,' Roderick W. Pugh] around here, but anyway--
Speaker 1: But you know what you said.
Speaker 2: (Background noise) The guys came to me and--everything set up?
Speaker 1: Yeah, everything's set up.  Keep going.
Speaker 2: And they said that the inspector general was coming and all the other noncoms [noncommissioned officers], above me in rank, and I was a staff sergeant at the time, so tech sergeant, master sergeant, the only two guys above me, that everyone had signed onto to request an interview with the inspector general, and they wanted to know if I was also gonna to sign on this.  Now I was under the impression at the time that the two top noncoms had signed on to this, but whether they had or not wouldn't really have made any difference about my decision, and I told him, well, you know, cut me in on it because definitely I will also be a person who requests an interview with the inspector general because that is supported by army regulations.  Any man in an outfit can request an interview with the inspector general whenever the inspector general visits that outfit.  So I said count me in, yes.  Well, so the inspector general arrived a couple of days after that and the adjutant called the whole battalion out into a formation, and I think the battalion consist of, I'm not exactly sure how many men, but maybe five hundred men or something like that.  Quite a sizable group.  Maybe not quite that many, but several hundred, let me put it that way.  And, he said the inspector general is here, he is ready to see any many who is interested in talking with him about any problem whatsoever having to do with the [U.S.] Army, and all men who are interested in having this opportunity, take one step forward, and for about two or three seconds, nobody moved, nobody.  And I'd been told he guys who outranked me had signed onto this.  But then I took one step forward and every man in that battalion took one step forward after I did, leaving the three sergeants who outranked me, standing back and, of course, the commissioned officers weren't even involved in this at that particular time.  So, I said, uh-huh, so I'm now the leader of this thing.
Story_ID: 284093
Speaker 1: I had my interview with the inspector general who was really a very nice guy.  And he was, of course, very impressed by the fact that all of the men but three of the top noncoms [noncommissioned officers] had requested an interview with him and he then, of course, asked me what the situation was about, what brought this on, and I began to explain.  And it had to do with the fact that we were dissatisfied with the management of the battalion by the officers who were in charge, and for various and sundry reasons, and he then looked at my record and he said, "By the way, did you apply for Officer Candidate School [OCS] before you left the [United] States?"  And I said, "Yes, I did.  I put in an application."  And he says, "Well, what happened?"  I said, "Once I put the application in, I never heard a word from 'em."  He says, "Well I'm going to write a note for your commanding officer to endorse and forward your application for Officer Candidate School tonight before I leave."  And he said, "You be sure and re-submit the candidate for officer, an application for Officer Candidate School."  Of course, that made me feel very good that he should bring this up, I didn't bring it up, he asked me about it.  And the thing about it is I knew that the adjutant, at least I assumed, that the adjutant of the battalion was hearing everything we were talking about because his office, we were in a Quonset hut, and the walls were paper thin, and his office was right next door to where we were so I was almost certain that he was sitting in his office listening to everything that we were saying.  And I was very happy that it turned out that way, that I had been given really, an order by this inspector general, to submit an application for OCS, so they couldn't blame me, but well, anyway, so I did that and then the officers above me in this battalion set up a situation to sabotage that plan and that order.  It is all spelled out in, in my book ['Psychology and the Black Experience,' Roderick W. Pugh].  I don't know whether it's necessary for me to go into details of it right here or not.  I, what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I just think it's, you know, the deliberate sabotage of some of you.
Speaker 1: Well, what happened, what happened was that I, I filled out an application for OCS, which would have meant that I had to come all the way back to the United States to go to OCS here in the United States to become commissioned and then maybe they'd send me back to Europe or something like that.  But I followed the inspector general's orders because he ordered me to make out an application for OCS, which I did.  But then, the next time I was on duty overnight in the battalion office and that's a regular sort of thing, it's called CQ, Charge of Quarters, I got a telephone call asking to see the battalion adjutant, and the battalion adjutant wasn't in the office and they'd come through to the office in his dress uniform and got into a command car that headed towards, what seemed to be the exit gate of the compound, as if he were going out of the compound for something that was important because he was in his dress uniform.  And so I told the person on the other end of the phone that he wasn't there, and that this is what had happened, and then he gave the person on the other end of the phone, gave me a message to hand, to take to another officer, which I wrote down, took to the other officer and proceeded to forget about it.  The next morning, the battalion adjutant, who was the guy that he had asked for, asked me, "Did you get a telephone call last night while you were charge of quarters?"  I said, "Oh yeah."  And then I explained to him.  He said, "Did you send a courier to my Bachelor's Officers Quarters to see if I might be there?"  I said, "Well, no sir, I didn't because I saw you get in the command car, the command car left here in the direction of the main gate, so everybody who saw you leave was assuming that you were going out of the compound, perhaps to the hospital to see the commanding officer," who happened to have been in the hospital at the time.  And he says, "Did, and you didn't send anybody to my quarters to see if I was there?"  I said, "No, I didn't."  And he reduced me from, I think I was a staff sergeant, to private, for inefficiency.  And then kicked me out of the battalion to another battalion.  And so that was one of the exciting aspects of my [U.S.] Army career.
Speaker 2: How'd you feel about that?
Speaker 1: This is the Army.  He was after me, had been after me, so he probably arranged the telephone call and the whole damn thing.
Story_ID: 284094
Speaker 1: Now, okay, I was kicked out of that particular battalion, transferred to another battalion.  About six months later, some guy comes, I was still in the front office, serving in the front office of the new battalion, and the guy comes in and he says, "Pugh [HistoryMaker Roderick Pugh], the battalion commander wants to see you."  I said, "Oh, God, not again."  I said, "What does he want to see me for?"  He said, "We don't know, but he wants you to come to his office."  So I go to the guy's office and I hadn't known him very well because we had had, I hadn't been in the command, in the outfit long enough to get to know him, and so on.  And he said, "By the way, I have received a message from General [George S.] Patton and he has decided that instead of sending back to the United States for recent graduates out of OCS [Officer Candidate School] who are officers but they've had no combat experience or anything like that, he's decided that he's gonna elevate some of his own men to officers status, because one they become officers, they also have had all the experience that we've had over here since the war's [World War II, WWII] been going on, and he has asked each battalion commander to recommend a person to go before the board and to, perhaps, if necessary, if it's successful, to become a second lieutenant by that means."  And he says, "I have selected you to represent this battalion."  I said well, then I said to him, "But sir, have you seen my service record?"  He says, "No I haven't taken a look at your service record.  He says why are you asking me?"  I said, "Because it's noted in my service record that I was reduced from staff sergeant to private before joining your outfit here for inefficiency."  He says, "What kind of crap are you handing me?"  That's what he said.  And I said, "Sir, it's true."  He says, "Well tell me what happened," and then I told him exactly what happened, you know, that the I.G. [inspector general] was there, I had requested an interview with the I.G., blah, blah, blah, happened to be the first guy who stepped forward and then as a result of that they tricked me and deprived me of my rank and then sent me to your outfit.  And after I told him what had happened, show what kind of a good guy, he says, "Well I'm going to send you to the board anyway." He says, "And if they take a look at your service record and they see those entries in there sir, you tell them exactly what you told me."  So he sent me to this board and by the way, I'll never forget the situation.  We were supposed to report at a particular point where they interview was going to be, and by the way, the interviews were in for--in front of a whole board of officers.  There must have been about six to eight officers who were sitting at a long table and there were twenty-six guys who had been recommended by various outfits to come to the get an interview to determine whether he or, well there were no women involved at that time, to determine whether George, George S. Patton, should elevate them to officer status.  And when we reported for duty for this interview, we had to reach in a bowl and pull out a number and that determined the number that you had in going in for the interview.  There were twenty-six of us, twenty-six candidates.  Guess what number I pulled out of the bowl? Number twenty-six.  I sat there all day long, seeing these guys go in for their interview and come out.  Finally, I went in for the interview.  And they questioned me very straight-forwardly about all this service entry.  I explained the whole situation to them and they were impressed by the fact, I could see that, that I already had a master's degree, but, when I was drafted and so on and so forth.  Well to make a long story short, there were five of us who were selected to be, have direct appointments, and I was one of the five.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So George S. Patton elevated from me from staff sergeant to second lieutenant, at the bat--at the bat of an eye, and that was a, that was very fine experience for me finally in the [U.S.] Army.
Story_ID: 284095
Speaker 1: As the war wore on, I was still in Europe and some message came through to the effect that guys who had put in so much time, I'd forgotten exactly how much time, in the United States Army, if they wished--now, the war is over with now.  We had won, but we still had army units in Europe and France and Germany and so on.  So the idea was that if you had had, put in so much time in Europe and you wished to come back to be discharged from the service, that if you made that known, they would send you back home.  So, so when my company commander came up to me and said, "Hey Pugh [HistoryMaker Roderick Pugh], they just ordered that you know, you can go back to the [United] States and get discharged from the service if you want to.  But you only a second lieutenant and I'm pretty sure you wouldn't want to be discharged from the Army as a second lieutenant, would you?"  I said, "Are you sure I can be discharged if say so?"  He said, "Well, yeah."  I said, "Bye."  So I came back to the United States as a second lieutenant and was discharged from the United States Army as a second lieutenant.  And that was the end of my Army career.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But you, now this is 1945, right?
Speaker 1: Forty-five [1945], early '45 [1945].
Speaker 2: Early part of '45 [1945].
Speaker 1: Because I got back here in time to enter the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] to start work on my doctorate by the fall of the '45 [1945] when school opened.  So this was the early part of '45 [1945].
Speaker 2: Now the war was still going on, right?
Speaker 1: The war had essentially sort of petered out, you know.  There wasn't much combat going on, but there was, there were arm, we had an army of occupation over there, sure.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 1: But combat situations had all been cleared up.
Speaker 2: Okay, even in the Pacific at that time?
Speaker 1: Well now I don't know about the Pacific.  I don't remember what was going on because I was in Europe.  I don't remember what was going on in the Pacific.
Speaker 2: Okay.  At any rate you came back and you, you went back to school.
Speaker 1: Immediately.  That was the main reason I was interested in coming back, because actually, because of, I was fortunate enough to go through World War II [WWII] in Europe and essentially come out unscathed, I think I scratched my leg a couple of times or something like that, but no serious injuries whatsoever.  I, it was a fascinating and unimaginable experience.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  It seems to be the cardinal experience of most men your age.
Speaker 1: Oh yes, I--
Speaker 2: They can remember every detail of it.  How did that affect, how does the war affect your thinking about psychology, if at all?  I mean did you, I mean we were talking about human behavior, the science of human behavior, you had a, the Army is a big laboratory for that.
Speaker 1: It didn't affect my thinking very much about psychology at all, although, of course, being in the Army at the time of combat, you are under a lot of pressure, emotional pressure yourself, and you are interacting with other people who are under emotional pressure, but the interesting thing is the whole time I was in Europe, I never even ran into an army individual who happened to have been a psychologist.  There were not very many guys who were requesting or seeing a need of psychological assistance per se.  And so, by the time I had become an officer at an administrative level and so on and so forth, I sort of forgot about being a psychologist in the Army, but of course, as soon as I got out of the Army with the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] under my belt, I came directly to the University of Chicago and the reason for that was that my faculty advisor from [The] Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio] had left Ohio State and had joined the faculty at U of C, and he and I had, had, you know, come off so well working together that when I wrote and told him that I was out of the service and raring to go to start work on my doctorate, he then said that he would like very much to have me come to the University of Chicago and do my doctorate, and he would continue to sponsor my work.  And that was all I needed from Carl R. Rogers.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Who by that time, by the way, had begun to make an international name for himself.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I was a very, very lucky guy.
Story_ID: 284096
Speaker 1: Now what was the experience like at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] working on your Ph.D. (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, fantastic.  Totally fantastic.  Yes and the interesting thing is that [The] Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio], I did not have a single class in which I was not the only African American in the course.  And interestingly, another thing, at the University of Chicago, believe it or not, I had only one course during my doctorate studies, in which there was one other African American in the class.  So throughout my entire graduate education in psychology, I found myself except in one instance, the only African American in the class.  And that only shows that there weren't that many African Americans seeking degrees in psychology because there were a lot of African Americans in graduate school, but they were in other departments and so on and so forth.  I don't know what that says about the interests of African Americans, but I think one of the things, of course, is most African Americans that I knew who were in graduate school, they were in graduate school because they wanted to make their lives more secure.  They wanted to have some kind of credential where they could go out and make a living.  And, of course, I think that, you know, psychologist, sure it's a credential and so on, but there were only a few ways of making a living as a psychologist and private practice at that particular time wasn't all that popular.  But with me, you know, if I have a strong interest like that, I'm going to pursue and I have never regretted it.  I have been a very, very fortunate individual and one of the early African Americans to so totally involve himself in psychology.
Speaker 1: Now what was your, what was the subject of your dissertation?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think of how I can put it so that it might be reasonably understandable.  You've heard of electric shock therapy perhaps, have you, ever heard of electric shock therapy?  It's a, it's a particular therapeutic intervention for persons who are depressed.  Well we didn't know too much about electroconvulsive therapy at that particular time, and here again, Carl Rogers was my supervisor, all right.  Carl Rogers' approach to psychotherapy was certainly far from anything having to do with electroconvulsive therapy, but I decided that it would be interesting to try to determine exactly what effects electrical, electroconvulsive therapy, ECT, could have on hospitalized psychiatric patients who were assigned to get ECT three times a week, Monday, Wednesday and Friday, you get your shock, electric currents passed through your brain.  And so I setup a dissertation to study systematically the psychological changes that took place as a result of an individual receiving a series of ECT treatments.  And so that was my doctorate dissertation under Carl Rogers who works were interesting because Carl Rogers would be one of the last psychologists in the world who would necessarily think about working with people who were receiving shock therapy.  But, he, nevertheless, supervised my research and then there was another, the chairman of the psych department at the University of Chicago at the time, was, he had an M.D. as well as a Ph.D.  He was on my dissertation committee, and he was really quite interested in my study because of the fact that he also had a medical background.
Story_ID: 284097
Speaker 1: What did you find out?  Is there anything that we would understand about, you know--?
Speaker 2: Well, electroconvulsive therapy is very effective in reducing evidences of depression in people, and that was essentially the finding of my study that primarily it reduced any symptomatology having to do with depressed, depression, but beyond that, in terms of the instruments, scales and so on and so forth, the methodology I used, there was not much of a significant difference in the behavior of people over a long haul.  Now, of course, as soon as you get a shock treatment, you are sort of dazed somewhat for a few minutes and so on and so forth, but I'm talking about long-range treatment.
Speaker 1: So you conclusion is that it was useful or not?
Speaker 2: Well, not really, because the subjects that I used for my dissertation all were selected on a particular kind of basis in terms of the problems and personality characterization and so on and so forth that they had.  So my research findings for my dissertation would apply only to that particular group of people.  So it wasn't necessarily that my findings could be totally generalized to every patient in a hospital, but it was good enough for me to get a doctorate and that was, and you know, what it really looked at, when you're doing a dissertation and that is the methodology of your study so that it complies with scientific expectations.  Comply, it complies with the expectation of scientific research.  That's the main thing that the university or your sponsors focus on.  And so, my research design was such that they could approve it and I got my degree.  And I'm very satisfied.
Speaker 1: Were there any other students?
Speaker 2: Doing the same kind of research at the same time?  I was the only one doing it on EST at that time.
Speaker 1: All right. ECT, rather.  Is that ECT?
Speaker 2: Yeah, electroconvulsive therapy, ECT.
Speaker 1: Did you, how did you like Chicago [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois]?  Well, you're still here, so we assume you liked Chicago fine, but--
Speaker 2: Chicago?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Oh, I love Chicago [Illinois].  Oh, yeah, I love Chicago, love it very much.  And, you know, I've known Chicago since I was around ten years old because my mother [Lena White Pugh] and I came up here and spent approximately two years while my father [George Pugh] was in the process of moving his practice from Kentucky to Dayton [Ohio].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then once he had gotten an office and residence and all that sort of stuff set up in Dayton, then he sent for my mother and I to join him in Dayton, and we did.
