Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Eighteen '80s [1880s] or 1890s?
Speaker 2: Why would you ask a question like that?  I have no idea.  I think, let me come back to that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And where was she born, do you know?
Speaker 2: She was born in Middlesex County, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 166735
Speaker 1: Now, now what do you know about her side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Well I go, go back to 'cause I used to stay at my Grandmother Kitty's--gave me the worst whipping I ever had in my life 'cause I sassed her.  And she lived in Middlesex County right near the County Road.  Got mad with her and decided I was going home.  She wouldn't call me back.  I kept looking for her to call me back 'cause she never did call me back and I went up the road a little while and then I came back and, and sat on the front porch and just acted ugly.  And didn't talk or anything and she gave me a whooping.
Speaker 1: So what did you do--what, what, what happened to make you wanna run away?
Speaker 2: 'Cause I was mad with her and she wanted me--such a little thing.  She wanted me to wash my feet and legs in that old octagon soap and I told her my mama [Etta Shelton Cauthorne] didn't use that, she used Ivory soap for me.  And she told me that--I told her I was gone tell my mama.  She said that's all right, I whipped her fore I whipped you.  So she whipped me good.  I sassed her real good.  I bet I didn't sass anymore.
Speaker 1: About how old were you then?
Speaker 2: I was just about nine years old, even nine years old.  But I was telling her what my mama didn't do, and what my mama did.  And that's when she told me she whipped her fore she ever whipped me.
Speaker 1: Now did your grandmother ever tell you stories about the family and about, about her mother or how she was raised or anything like that?
Speaker 2: Not too much, but they were very strict parents.  When they told you to do something, they expected you to do it and they didn't expect any sass or anything back.  You just went on and did what they were--what they told you to do.  And they were, were, they were lenient.  I had to, I had to feed the cats and I had certain things that I had to do that she demanded.  And then I had to live the way that she lived and I was about thirty miles from where my mother lived.  And I was there for the summer.
Speaker 1: Well did she ever talk to you about her--when she was a little girl or anything about--
Speaker 2: Yes, you know you, you didn't give your opinion.  You--she told you 'bout doing whatever you were told to do.  For eating, eat whatever was on that plate and you didn't complain about it.  You just learned to eat these different foods.  And, and to have a clean plate, eat all of it.  And it was for my health, not for hers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did she teach you how to do anything?
Speaker 2: My goodness.  Number one when you got through eating, if you didn't feed the cats, then you had a problem.  So we had little chores that we had to do.  She lived in--it was a very large house and looked like every day she had to go and pick up something or do something if it wasn't anymore than a feather on the floor.  She kept a spotless house.  And she expected me to do--this was when I was staying with her during the summer.  Otherwise she was real nice and--but she was very strict about keeping your body clean and, and not saying ugly words and all that kind of thing and you obeyed, you didn't sass anybody then.  That's why I got such a whooping, 'cause I sassed her.
Speaker 1: So that was about 1920, 1921 when you were about eight or nine years old I guess, right?
Speaker 2: That was--I was born in 1912.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So I guess it was around that time.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 166736
Speaker 1: Did she [maternal grandmother, Grandmother Kitty] ever talk about the family history?  About where--about, about slavery or about any of that type of stuff?
Speaker 2: Not a whole lot.  Now my--I would say we were more or less in one of the preferred families.  My grandfather that I didn't know too much about, they called him Captain Shelton.  And they lived in a very large updated house in Urbanna, Virginia, or Saluda I guess we would call it because they had these little post office and places in Saluda, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they lived on a big farm.
Speaker 1: Okay so they--it was their farm?
Speaker 2: It was their farm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did they ever talk about how they got it or how they got the farm, or--
Speaker 2: They worked and saved their money and bought it and it, it seemed to have been a, a family value for everybody to have something of their own.
Story_ID: 166737
Speaker 1: Well can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Robert Henry Cauthorne, R-O-B-E-R-T, Robert Henry Cauthorne.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is his date of birth, birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  It was in Dunnsville, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, he was Ozana O-Z-E-N-A, O-Z-E-N-A, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you--
Speaker 2: And he was a son of a, I would say a preferred slave because he was given the name Cauthorne from his family name, the white group.
Speaker 1: Okay, but he wasn't a slave himself, right?
Speaker 2: He wasn't a slave himself.  He was, was one of the preferred negroes I guess in there.
Speaker 1: But his, his father had been--
Speaker 2: A Slave.
Speaker 1: His parents had been slaves.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: All right, for the Cauthornes, okay, all right.  Now did, did they ever tell stories about those days?  Any, any family history about what happened back in those ti--times?
Speaker 2: Well they use--they, they valued the family very much.  And they had family secrets and things that they talked--well it, it wasn't any the business of the children, that's what we got, you know if you ask some questions.  They were a close knit group.  My mother [Etta Shelton Cauthorne] was from Middlesex County [Virginia] and he was from Essex County [Virginia].  And they lived on a farm I guess over 100 acres farm.  And they--I know they had hired help to maintain that.
Speaker 1: Okay, but they didn't talk about any history or anything about the family--about where--
Speaker 2: Not, not too much.  They, they--family was kind of close and just some things belonged in the family and didn't belong out in the community and they didn't talk too much.  At that time children didn't enter into conversations like they do now.  You heard and didn't hear.
Story_ID: 166738
Speaker 1: They never talked about the Civil War days or anything like that, or about what the family was doing then or, or they never told any stories about that time?
Speaker 2: Well I remember when some of them came--that must have been World War I when they came, I guess it was.  That World War I?  I guess so.
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifteen [1915] to 1918 [sic, 1914-1918].
Speaker 2: I remember when my uncle came home from service and had these khaki (?) things and those things you wrap around the legs and looking just like a soldier.  Now that was my uncle.  My brothers weren't old enough, you know to, to be in service at that time 'cause I was the second child in the family.  And so I heard 'em talking about the war and how sad it was and that by the time you'd be looking at a person (unclear) that person would be killed or something.  It was very brutal and many times you didn't even want to hear too much about it.  But they had to keep going.  And it, it was a sad situation around that time.
Speaker 1: Did he serve in--I guess he served in Europe during World War I?
Speaker 2: Far as I know it was Europe.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Because I, I have been to Europe since then and I had to think of how people walked and things that they had to do at that time.  I got tired of walking.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 166739
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about your mother [Etta Shelton Cauthorne].  What, what was your mother like and, and what did she do for a living?
Speaker 2: Took care of the house, took care of the family.  They did all the cooking, all the sewing.  I didn't have a bought coat until I went to college.  My mother made all our clothes.  And sometimes out of flour bags, sugar bags, put 'em together.  They could take the shirttail where they'd worn out around the neck and put it together with another color or something and made some little dresses and things for my children.  And she say she had done the same thing for me.  They, at that time they made practically all the clothes.  I didn't have a, a commercially bought coat until I got ready to go to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did your mother have a chance to go to school when she was growing up?
Speaker 2: She didn't have--I don't know about the chance, but she didn't go any further than elementary education.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Her elementary education.  I think she entered high school, but did not finish.  But she learned to read and write and take care of her business and take care of her family and did most of our--making of our clothes and the canning of food and cooking of food and so on.  They were family people.  Sunday mornings we had prayers and all of us had to pray.  And before breakfast, we were ready to eat sometimes; they going in there with prayer, but we had to go along with whatever they wanted to go along with.  And we were--they didn't tell us a lot of things.  Parents kept a lot of things from us.  I laugh right now because I came from under a cherry tree.  They didn't tell me how I got here.  Somehow they told me and I believed for a long time they found me in a cherry--under the cherry tree and the doctor brought me in a little black bag.  And I believed it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know I mean you didn't--pregnancy wasn't anything.  I heard a little girl say all day my mama got pregnant last night.  Well we didn't even talk that around children.  I told you I came--I--the doctor brought me in this little black bag.
Speaker 1: Okay, so very, very kind of formal--
Speaker 2: Very formal.  They, they just--certain words they didn't use and they didn't just talk.  Sex was unheard of, you know, to, to talk about.
Speaker 1: To talk about it.
Speaker 2: And we had family prayers and sometimes after we'd studied at night, we would maybe have a candy pull, make some molasses candy.  We raised, we raised molasses on the farm.  And then we'd have a little family get together and they'd tell us stories and we sometimes used to sing together.  And Mama would be sitting at the sewing machine because she made all of our clothes.  Sometimes out of sugar bags or a flour bag, bleached 'em and fixed 'em and we were just as important as anybody else.
Story_ID: 166740
Speaker 1: Now tell us something about your father [Robert Henry Cauthorne].  You know what was he like and what did he do?
Speaker 2: My father was a farmer.  Also when he found out he wasn't making it so well on the farm, he took a job as a Pullman porter.  And he was sometimes away from home and sometimes he would, you know, be at home for a while.  And that was to make ends meet along with the farming.  And then he, he arranged to have a tomato factory where they can tomatoes and some other food, but largely they were tomatoes and that--and they bought.  And he ran that factory and sold the products.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he, he ran his own tomato--
Speaker 2: Yes.  And that was during spare time.  Much of his time he spent working on the railroad as a--
Speaker 1: Pullman porter.
Speaker 2: Porter.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that, that's a tiring job too from what I've heard.  They spent a lot of time awake on those trains.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.  But in the meantime he had some hired help for operating the farm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay now did he get a chance to go to school much, or did, or did he go very far in school?
Speaker 2: No.  My--I think my parents just finished elementary school.  He may have entered, he may have entered the high school, they had a private high school.  But at that time, right there in that county, there wasn't an opportunity for us--for public education.
Story_ID: 166741
Speaker 1: We went to a--and that's what amazed me when all these academies came, because I went to an academy.
Speaker 2: Okay.  What was the name of it?
Speaker 1: Ran by the, by the Baptist Association.
Speaker 2: What was the name of your school?
Speaker 1: Rappahannock Industrial Academy, R-A-P-P-A-H-A-N-N-O-C-K Industrial, I-N-D-U-S-T-R-I-A-L Academy [Ozeana, Virginia].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now that was a privately owned by a Baptist Association.
Speaker 2: Okay, this is a black school right?
Speaker 1: Black school.  Yeah weren't no whites comin' there at that time.
Story_ID: 166742
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about growing up.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: We lived on a farm that they owned.  Most of the girls worked on the farm.  I didn't want to work on the farm.  I somehow would get an excuse.  And my excuse would be, even from a little girl, preparing dinner because we had hired help and we had to give them dinner too.  So I got away from doing a lot of the hard labor on the farm like planting corn and thinning it out and all that kind of thing and working with the hoe.  I got the job of getting home to help in the house, to help my mother [Etta Shelton Cauthorne] prepare meals for the hired help.
Speaker 1: Now how, how many siblings do you have?
Speaker 2: Do I have?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I just have the two girls.
Speaker 1: Just two sisters?
Speaker 2: Two sisters, Jean and Audrey.
Speaker 1: No, I'm talking 'bout how many--
Speaker 2: Growing up?
Speaker 1: Brothers and sisters did you--
Speaker 2: Did I have?
Speaker 1: That you have.
Speaker 2: I, there were two girls and three boys.
Speaker 1: Okay, and can you name 'em for us and, and place yourself in the order?
Speaker 2: Alfred Shelton Cauthorne [ph.], that's the oldest boy.  Then Pauline, Marian Pauline Cauthorne [ph.], then Henry Roselle Cauthorne [ph.], then Robert Stuart Cauthorne [ph.] and Izetta Francine Cauthorne [ph.].  Five of us, two girls and one boy.  I mean two--three boys and two girls.
Speaker 1: So you were number two.
Speaker 2: I was number two.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I--and I didn't want to work on the farm.  I would--I did all the helping in the house with the cooking and things because it was a large farm and we had hired help that you had to feed 'em in the middle of the day.
Speaker 1: How many people were hired?  Do you--
Speaker 2: I don't know.  Depend upon the season and what they had to do.  Sometimes it may be two, and sometime it might be three people working on the farm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So wasn't that many, but there were--
Speaker 2: I mean we had horses and stuff that they had to deal with and then later on we got a tractor.  I remember when my daddy [Robert Henry Cauthorne] got a tractor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 166743
Speaker 1: What was that like, when your daddy [Robert Henry Cauthorne] got the tractor?
Speaker 2: Well you didn't have all the stuff to do with the horses.  And we went with the horse and buggy, the buggy was when two people would go.  My daddy had a racehorse but we couldn't drive a racehorse, we had to drive the others and they were all named, Bessie and Sam and whatever, 'cause I remember going--Sam turned me right in the sand, cut me right down and I had to walk.  He just stopped--had to walk.  But we used to ride horse when we went with the family.  We went with the two seated buggy.  But if we went somewhere with the whole family, we went in what we call at that time a surrey.  That was a two seated thing to carry the whole family.
Speaker 1: It had two long seats on the side sort of?
Speaker 2: Had--they had--there was a front and a back.  And then sometimes there were the seats on the side also.  As far as I remember.
Story_ID: 166744
Speaker 1: So what were some of the other sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well even when we--when we couldn't have company, you know you weren't dating or something--boyfriend would come along to play with my brothers and we used to go horseback riding and it was just pleasure to ride along beside your boyfriend.  That was courting, riding along on the horseback, we used to go horseback riding.  And the cars weren't--hadn't started having cars then 'cause I--my family was one of the first to get a car.
Speaker 1: When did your family get a car, do you remember how old you were?
Speaker 2: I was probably, I was probably 'bout twelve years old, ten or twelve years old when they got a car.  But before then, we went, we went as a family because I told we had what they call the horse and buggy and then we had the surrey.  That was a two-seated vehicle.
Speaker 1: So did you go, did you go very far in the surrey?
Speaker 2: No, we--about twenty--we went from our house down to Middlesex [County, Virginia] where my mother [Etta Shelton Cauthorne]'s--and they used to be--and would stay all night from that, that was about twenty-eight or thirty miles from home and we rode the horse and buggy and I remember when there were two of us, my older brother and I, that we had to sit--he had to sit and hold me 'cause I was the second child and he was older.  And we would get in the buggy and go from our house down to our grandmother's house which was about twenty-eight or thirty miles.  But you had to stay all night so they put up the horse and the buggy, same thing when the preacher came to visit.  You not only took care of the preacher, but you had to take care of the horse and buggy too.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: It was a horse and buggy day.
Speaker 1: Well a lot of people now don't know anything about that, you know, 'cause--
Speaker 2: I'm sure they won't, they can't imagine.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  So I'm glad that you can tell us something about it.
Speaker 2: And, and on Sunday afternoon, that's when you got a little chance when the young man couldn't come to your house, you could ride along beside him on the horseback riding.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you just get on a horse and meet him somewhere and ride along?
Speaker 2: Well he may, yeah, that's right.  He would be coming from somewhere and you'd be coming from somewhere.  And then you had to be home by dark.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Going horseback riding.
Speaker 1: Okay, so if he didn't have permission to come see you, you could might--be able to see him just by riding.
Speaker 2: Or come to see my brother.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now how long did--does it take to go thirty miles in a buggy?
Speaker 2: Well I would say--I'm just guessing now.  I would say it was about a hour and a half because sometime you had to stop at a pond so that the horse could get some water.  And then you'd be off again.  And my mother used to go that distance with--sitting in the buggy, in the foot, and my brother would be on the seat with her, holding the second child.  And we'd go along like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we went that distance, you may have had to stop at a pond and get some--so the horse could get some water or something like that.  And then you tie the horse and that was a famous expression, tie the horse and come on in.
Speaker 1: Okay.  People used to say that?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 166745
Speaker 1: Now was church a big factor in growing up?
Speaker 2: Church, we went to church, but not like they do now.  You went there for Sunday School and church and then you came on back home.  They didn't have a lot of activities like they have now.  But church was a part of it and you had prepared for church because you had your little Bible study at home, you read Bible and prayed.  And so you knew about what you were doing and what you were doing when you went to the church.  The funniest little thing happened to me though when I went, went once.  And I saw people putting down money and taking up money and I did the same thing, on the table.
Speaker 1: You put, put some money down and took it up?
Speaker 2: Well the people were putting down money and that's what I thought they were doing.  So I took up me some money after I had put some money down.  Then my mama [Etta Shelton Cauthorne] explained to me about how this was way of making change when they would do that.  But you--we had to take that money back.  'Cause you had really--you had taken it but we didn't know any difference.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 166746
Speaker 1: I was saying that we had to--we used to say our prayers around our mother's [Etta Shelton Cauthorne] knees at night before we would go to bed.  And I remember one night my brother asking Lord bless everybody by name and he didn't call me by name.  And I said "Mama, he didn't say me, Mama, he didn't say me.  I want him pray for me too."  So he had to get back on his knees and ask the Lord to ask Pauline too.
Speaker 2: That's a sweet story.
Speaker 1: She often would tell that, that was so true.
Speaker 2: That's a sweet story.
Speaker 1: We would get around the bed and say our prayers around our mother and we'd go around the room.  And we didn't have fire or heat, heated by stove, would you know.  But that was in Mama's room.  Then we would go to our bed just as quick as could be and get in that bed and wrap up 'cause it would be cold in the bed.  'Cause it was warm in her room; we didn't have heat in each room.  And we heated by a wood stove.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you had a wood stove to heat the--
Speaker 1: Heat, yeah, but you didn't heat the whole house like we have now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You just heated certain rooms.  And we'd have on our night clothes and when we say our prayers around the bed in her room where it was warm, then we run to our room and get in the bed.  That old cold bed.
Speaker 2: So you had to get up under the covers and warm up.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right, that's right.  But it was a jolly time; that was the way of life.  And you had to carry wood and one of my worse punishments was carrying--couldn't carry but two little pieces of wood.  And I had done something and my punishment was carry the wood and put it on the front porch was where that wood would go upstairs for the bedroom.  And I couldn't carry but two little pieces and she said she felt so sorry for me, but she had to punish me.
Speaker 2: So you had to go outside and get it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you had to go out there after they had cut the wood at the woodpile.  You don't know 'bout woodpiles now.  But then you had to carry it in.  We didn't have stuff like we have now; turn a switch.
Story_ID: 166747
Speaker 1: Is there anything else about church you wanna tell us?
Speaker 2: Well we went to church.  We went to Sunday school and then we stayed for church.  And, and the preacher--we didn't have activities, as many activities as we have in church today.  The preacher preached and they prayed and then you--they try to teach us to pray.  And I remember my oldest brother praying and he would pray a little bit 'cause he didn't know what to say and my daddy [Robert Henry Cauthorne] said "Go on, son.  Pray on, son."  And he, he, he--taught him how to pray in the church.  And then we'd have family prayers at home and that's where they really--the start was with your family prayers at home.
Story_ID: 166748
Speaker 1: What kind of music did you listen to when you were coming up?
Speaker 2: We had the Victrola.  You ever heard of it?
Speaker 1: Yes, ma'am.
Speaker 2: Thing you wind up.
Speaker 1: Okay, it was the wind-up kind, you put the record on and wind it up?
Speaker 2: And you had records that it played, and sometime you sing along with it.  We had a piano and we had an organ.  But everybody couldn't play the piano and organ.  But we would gather 'round that sometimes at night after we had studied and sing songs and so on.  A lot of stuff was done in the house.
Speaker 1: What, what kind of songs would you sing in those days?
Speaker 2: We had the music book and we sang these traditional songs, like 'Nearer My God to Thee' and things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then later on they got some records where they got some kind that you dance with and another kind of music.  But you had to have a old Victrola, you wound it up with your hand and music came through it.  I don't know how that thing worked, but it worked.
Speaker 1: So your parents didn't mind if you danced or anything.
Speaker 2: No, they, they didn't mind that at all.
Story_ID: 166749
Speaker 1: And many times after study at night, we would--sometimes they would tell us some stories and sometimes we would make candy.  We grew molasses cane on the farm.
Speaker 2: Molasses cane?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's what they call it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that, that's a thing they had to grind and get the juice out of it and then they cooked molasses from that.
Speaker 2: Like sugarcane.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you made your own on the farm?
Speaker 1: Made your own on the--in fact they--my mother [Etta Shelton Cauthorne] would put up sometimes hundreds of quarts or pints of fruits and vegetables, string beans, peaches, pears, apples, applesauce--hog killing time.  We didn't have the conveniences we have now, so many times they cooked that meat, fried the meat and put it--and made sausage and put it in jars and then you would open it.  Some of the best I ever had was when went home one night and mama opened a jar of spare ribs and made some onion brown gravy and she already had--we carried the bread with us because we didn't have--they didn't make as much loaf bread as they do now.  And the--in case they didn't have cold--they had biscuits and something and we carried some bread with us.  But it was a family thing.  At our house we always set the table and everybody as at the table.  And we always had prayer.  And when the preacher come, sometime he'd want all of us to pray 'round the table; we wanted to eat (laugther).  But we had to listen and everybody would say a prayer.  So we grew up with that kind of family and many times the pastor had to come miles by horse and buggy.  And so we put the man's horse; had to provide for him, for the horse and buggy and also for him to stay.  Like we were having service on Sunday and he would come on Saturday and maybe stay overnight so he'll be there in time, especially during the bad weather.
Speaker 2: Where did he live?
Speaker 1: He lived about twenty-five or thirty miles from us, in King and Queen County [Virginia], and we lived in Essex County [Virginia].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I mean it was commonplace to drive the horse and buggy because we had the horse and buggy.  My mother I said had--she would go to Middlesex where her home was with a horse and buggy.  And I remember winters per my older brother and myself and then my third brother came in and somebody had to help to hold him you know, in the buggy to go that thirty miles to see my grandma.

Speaker 1: Now tell me about school.  You went to--you gave us the name, it was Rappahannock Industrial Academy [Ozeana, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I first went to the public school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and my aunt was teaching at the public school.
Speaker 1: What was the name of that school?
Speaker 2: And that, that school was Ozeana, O-Z-E-N-A, O-Z-E-N-A [sic, O-Z-E-A-N-A] [Ozeana Public School, Ozeana, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Virginia.  That, that was the--the school was named Ozeana also.  And then we transferred to Dunnsville [Dunnsville Public School, Dunsville, Virginia], it was the same thing.  But we went to public school and you walked to public school.  One of my worst whippings I got, we' stopped to go skating on the ice pond.  And we were late for school.  And the teacher told my parents and they'd whoop you for anything.  They would really whoop you.  I mean they would whoop you.  Get your legs good and then sometime make you go get your own switches to whip you with.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they used the switch.
Speaker 2: Yes they used a switch and then later on my daddy used to for the boys, he used to use the razor strap.
Speaker 1: That's a pretty thick strap.
Speaker 2: I know it is.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But most of our whoopings were--I never had many whoopings.  I got out of 'em some kind of way.
Speaker 1: Did, did everybody you know get--did, did everybody get whippings or most people?
Speaker 2: Well some people didn't bother with the children.  They would get away with anything.  But that's what they did for children that time for punishment, is give 'em a whipping.  And make you stay still for a certain length of time or something of that kind.  So you wouldn't be running out playing.
Speaker 1: Like stand in a corner.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Or sit in a corner or something.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was terrible punishment; making you stand in the corner and that was hard on the physical body, but we obeyed and tried not to do it.  But they believed in that.  And they believed in whipping.
Story_ID: 166751
Speaker 1: Now you were at Ozeana Public School [Ozeana, Virginia].
Speaker 2: Ozeana Public School, then later when my aunt started to teaching in Dunnsville, we transferred to Dunnsville Public School, D-U-N-N-S-V-I-L-L-E.  Dunnsville Public School [Dunnsville, Virginia].  And we went through to the seventh grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: And then there was no public education provided beyond that.  So the Baptist Association had a school, sponsored a school, the Rappahannock Industrial Academy [Ozeana, Virginia].  And that's where we learned and we learned something 'bout religion and learned our lessons and we learned entertainment, and finally the school was accredited with all of the science and activities that we need to have.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: To go to college.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: So I went through that.  And then I went to Virginia State College [Virginia State College for Negroes, later, Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Now wait a minute now, slow down.  I wanna get you--I wanna talk about school a little bit, about grade school and high school.  But--
Speaker 2: Well it was a two room school that I went to.
Speaker 1: Ozeana?
Speaker 2: Ozeana.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then later transferred to a like school in Dunnsville, and that's where my aunt was teaching in Dunnsville.
Speaker 1: How old were you when you transferred?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  Probably 'bout the ninth or tenth grade.  And we went to school--
Speaker 1: Ninth or tenth grade or nine or ten years old?
Speaker 2: We were--we started school at seven years old I believe I--not too sure.  But it was early age.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then when her--she transferred to another school, then we transferred from Ozeana, O-Z-E-N-A to Dunnsville School, and it was a public education.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Two room school.
Speaker 1: Were both of 'em two room schools?  Okay.  So you had all the grades in those two rooms?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: All right, now are there any teachers you really remember from your grade school days that stand out?
Speaker 2: Yes, I remember my first grade teacher was Ms. Elmore [ph.].  Then I remember my aunt as I told you, who taught in the upper grades.  And--
Speaker 1: What was your aunt's name?
Speaker 2: Ida Cauthorne.  Ida Cauthorne.  And then I remember having a teacher named Ms. Elmore.  I remember some of the teachers that we had during the grade school.  And then we went as far as to finish, but the science program was very weak.  So when I went to Virginia State, I had to take a lot of science courses.
Story_ID: 166752
Speaker 1: Now before I take you to Virginia State [Virginia State College for Negroes, later, University, Petersburg, Virginia], I just wanted to ask you about--
Speaker 2: High school.
Speaker 1: High school too.  But were you a good student in grade school-high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was, I was a good student all the way through.  Had to 'cause they worked with you as best they knew how and gave you time to study and we studied at night around the table.  And then we made, make candy or have some cookies or donuts or something after we had studied, but we all studied around the dining room table in our family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And our parents [Etta Shelton Cauthourne and Robert Henry Cauthorne] didn't--hadn't been but so far, so it wasn't but so much help that they could give us.  But they gave us help in school.
Speaker 1: Okay, and encouragement too.
Speaker 2: Yes, you're gonna get that lesson.  Yes indeed, that came, that came first.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now well tell me about high school now.  When you went to high school, did they have activities in high school?
Speaker 2: When I, I went to--it was a, a academy that was sponsored by the association.
Speaker 1: The Baptist Association.
Speaker 2: Local association.  And they had--when I first started, they were short on science courses because they didn't have the labs and that kind of thing.  So I went there three years.  Then I went to Virginia State High School and I had to take a lot of science courses there because I had missed them during my high school days in the religious sponsored church school.
Speaker 1: Okay, did, did you have high school activities?  Like did you have like sports teams and clubs and sort--
Speaker 2: Baseball, and then finally they had basketball.  But we didn't have the sports that we have now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you run for office or anything, class office or anything like that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was a class officer.  And when I was in the private academy, I was one of those persons that the principal used to call out to entertain if they had company until some of 'em came in to look after 'em.  Had to go to the office and entertain them or do something of that sort.  And I was president of my class and I've always held office of some kind in most of my organizations that I have been in.  For some reason they say I had leadership ability.  And I was elected from time to time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you play any instrument or anything?
Speaker 2: Well they tried to give me piano lessons.  I didn't do well at that.  I learned the keyboard and a little something, but I never learned to really--and I could pick some hymns.  But I never could play by ear say, say, but I--but I have a great appreciation for music.  But I never do very much in it.  And even after I had come out and when we had the choral group, I joined the choral group.  Well we had to do things.  You didn't sit around and not do anything.  So I, and I have a great appreciation for music now.  And then when we had a music group here, Vy Harrison [Violet Harrison] organized, I don't know whether you ever heard of her or not, but she was a music--
Speaker 1: Who was that?
Speaker 2: Vy Harrison.  She was a music major and she got us together and enjoyed music.  And then we were members of the church choir.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 166753
Speaker 1: Now in high school, were there any teachers that really stood out in high school that you remember?  That helped you or, or you admired?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Ms. Elsa Harris [ph.], Elsa, yeah Elsa Harris, I remember her.  And another one who was all around--I don't, I can't say that I wanted to emulate any of 'em, but I appreciated what they were doing and wanted to be a leader like, like they were.  That's my greatest--not that I want to teach like they did, but I fell right into teaching.  And I--when I taught--I don't think I ever worked on a job after graduating that I applied--the job came to me.  Somebody saw what I was doing and the job came to me.
Speaker 1: Now when you were on the verge of graduating from high school, did you know what you wanted to do as a career?  Did you know what you wanted to be?  No.
Speaker 2: Because I went on and enrolled in business.  Well we went for three years 'cause we did--our science courses were very short in the public, in the private schools that we had.  So when I went to Virginia State, I--high school, I finished the high, I finished high school at the Rappahannock Industrial Academy.  They liked the science courses and that kind of thing, so when I went to Virginia State, I had another year for high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's when I really had a, an awakening as to what was I--I thought I wanted nursing.  Ended up in home economics.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what year was it when you, when you graduated from--
Speaker 2: High school, I think it was 1928.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Before you were born.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Story_ID: 166754
Speaker 1: So what was Virginia State [Virginia State College for Negroes, later Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia] like?  That's a black school too, right?
Speaker 2: Well Virginia State, they had a high school course.  As I said now at my school was a private school [Rappahannock Industrial Academy, Ozeana, Virginia].  We lacked science courses.  We didn't have the labs and the facilities for it.  So I took several courses when I went to high school at Virginia State.  And I finished the high school there and went right on into the college program in home economics.
Speaker 1: Now, now was college different from high school?  I mean did, did they--did you--
Speaker 2: Well it--I found it very different.  I found that the demands were greater.  And I guess I must have been a preferred student to some extent because I got the job of checking children in, in my--there's so many children you had to check off who were present or who were absent at the activities that we had.
Speaker 1: So they had you doing the attend--attendance for--
Speaker 2: A group, yes.  And of course we had to meet and talk with her.  And I got kind of close to the teachers at the time by doing that.  And so I had several little jobs of--responsible jobs in college, including being a cafeteria manager while I was in college, which was offered to me afterward, but I did not want it 'cause you had to go back for feeding on Sunday evenings and all that kind of thing, so I went into teaching.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: With a home economics major.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Are there any teachers at, at Virginia State that you remember that, that really did a good job or made an, an impression on you?
Speaker 1: Well Ms. Lucille Lewis, who was a physical ed teacher.  Mrs.--my home ec [economics] teacher, one I didn't like at all.  I sassed her out one day.  And the others, I--
Speaker 2: What happened?  Why didn't you like her, and what did you, what you--how did you sass her out?
Speaker 1: She was so (unclear).  I don't know what, and I was working in the cafeteria, working on the steam table line and, and she was just hateful.  And she made me mad one time and I laid her right on out.  I had the backing of another teacher, though, that I was fond of and I helped her grade papers and helped her with grading papers and doing some of the little office work and that kind of thing.  And then during the college time, I worked in the cafeteria as a, as a--whatever they-(unclear) table girl, that's what I was.  And then I was offered the job in the summer and I stayed there and worked during the summer as cafeteria manager.  And then I was offered the job after I finished as cafeteria manager, but I didn't want that anymore.  'Cause you had to go three meals a day and on Sunday when everybody else was out, you had to go in and--just certain hours and things that I didn't like about it, so I went into teaching.
Story_ID: 166755
Speaker 1: So when you graduated from Virginia State [Virginia State College for Negroes, later Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia], did you graduate with honors or did you--
Speaker 2: I, I had, I had some honors 'cause I got the--got some awards.  I remember Mamie (unclear) Award.  I don't even know what that award was now, but I did, I did do good work while I was there.  And when I came out and got a job in the private academy, and then when we came to Franklin [Virginia]--.
Speaker 1: Now wait a minute now, don't get--don't take us too far ahead.  Now you, you--where, where was your first job?
Speaker 2: At the Rappahannock Industrial Academy [Ozeana, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which no longer is in existence.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was in Ozeana, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 166756
Speaker 1: Now, now when did you meet your husband?  Was he--
Speaker 2: He taught me in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he taught at the--
Speaker 2: Academy [Rappahannock Industrial Academy, Ozeana, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And we married and came here.  He took a job here as principal.
Speaker 1: So he taught you first and then you went to college, then you--
Speaker 2: No, this was--no this was after college.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he taught me in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then--
Speaker 1: And then when you got the job there--
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Speaker 2: And then when we came to Franklin [Virginia]--
Speaker 1: 'Cause he got a job in--because he got a job in Franklin.
Speaker 2: As principal.
Speaker 1: Now what school was he principal of?
Speaker 2: Hayden High School [Franklin, Virginia], which still exists.
Story_ID: 166757
Speaker 1: Okay, so you started working there too, at Hayden High School [Franklin, Virginia].
Speaker 2: And I must have been doing a good job because I was tapped for a supervisor at the State Department of Education in home economics.  And I accepted that job.  At the meantime I had been offered a job at Norfolk State [University, Norfolk, Virginia], but I preferred the job as a supervisor at the State Department of Education.  And I served there twenty-five years, twenty-six years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How long was it--how long did you teach before you got the supervisor's job?
Speaker 2: 'Bout four years.
Speaker 1: Four years?
Speaker 2: Three or four years.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were the supervisor for a long time.
Speaker 2: I was.  I, I was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I mean it was with the State Department of Education.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were with the State Department of Education from what time to what time?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it was--
Speaker 1: Okay, so you graduated from--let's, let's--
Speaker 2: Twenty-something years.
Speaker 1: Okay, well let's go back for a minute.  You graduated from Virginia State in what year?
Speaker 2: Thirty-three [1933].
Speaker 1: Thirty-three [1933], okay.  All right.  Okay.  Thirty-three [1933], so then you--then when you--and you weren't out long before you started working here, right?  Okay so would you say you were a supervisor for the state in, in the '30s [1930s], in the late '30s [1930s]?
Speaker 2: I think it was thirty, '35 [1935].  Either '35 [1935] or '36 [1936].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Cause I hadn't taught that long, but evidently I was doing good work, so the job came to me.  And I accepted.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you taught for another twenty-five years you said.  I mean you were the supervisor.
Speaker 2: Supervisor.
Speaker 1: For about twenty-five years.
Speaker 2: Between twenty-five and thirty years.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So that would take you until the--up through the '60s [1960s], right?  So--
Speaker 2: Sixties [1960s].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, do you remember the year that you retired from that job?  What, what year, what year was it?
Speaker 2: It's been so long now, I tell ya--sixty, '63 [1963], sixty--no wait a minute I came--I must have come up in the, into the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In that job because I worked--it's strange.  I can't remember.  I ought to be remembering that.  Going all over the state and other states too.  Let me see.  I think I retired, I've been retired about twenty-five or more years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So about '73 [1973], '74 [1974], something like that, '73 [1973]?  Seventy-two [1972], '73 [1973]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 166758
Speaker 1: So I wanted to ask you like what were some of your duties as supervisor of Home Economic Programs for the State of Virginia?
Speaker 2: Well we planned activities for the year as a group for the state.  Then we were--I think they--our, our title was area supervisor.  In other words, I didn't have the--we met at times as a whole state, but I had a certain area, southeastern area was my area that I supervised.  I went into schools where they--this was a home economics supervisor and school lunch part of the time.  And so I went into the schools to check to see what they were doing and if it was in keeping with what the State Department--'cause we had met prior to going into schools.  And then we visited and looked at the job that was being done and if--and we evaluated it with them.  We sat down and, and evaluated the job that they were doing, whether they were re--and at that time, you found the needs of children at the particular school, and then you worked on the needs.  So different from the way they teach now.  And way they work on things.  So this was what we did and the whole thing was trying to stay in line with what the [Virginia] State Department of Education had as their goal.  And then if we observed classes and had a little conference with them afterward with the principal and whomever else was involved and all.  And it was a matter of helping, not criticizing. If--now just if you'd go in and you find out that the teaching was contrary to what was recommended at the state, you found a nice way to not hurt the person, but get 'em back on line.  And then you had to go through the superintendent of schools and you had to go through the principal and might be a supervisor, whoever was--and the whole idea was to get the job on foot with what was recommended by the State Department of Education.
Story_ID: 166759
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now did you have responsibility for all the schools, or just the black schools or what?
Speaker 2: I first started out just black schools.  Then before I left, we were doing it--well integration had come about, so we were doing all schools.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you didn't lose your job.
Speaker 2: In that certain area.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you didn't use your--lose your area job at all.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And see we were--through the superintendent our procedures was to go through the superintendent.  Sometime we just write him, let him know that you're gonna be in the area and if you wanted to see him, you go by the office and talk with him and whatever his recommendations and you, you work with people.  I mean we didn't do a dictatorship thing, except when they were out of line.  Then you had to find a nice way to say something to get 'em back in line.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was pretty good at that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  For, for instance what would you say to somebody?  Say I was doing the wrong thing and I was teaching 'em how to butter the bread wrong or something wrong, some other--something wrong.  What would you tell me?
Speaker 2: Well I would--I'd go back and, and, and I had something--I had done things as simple as that, that you mention.  But we would just go and tell them 'bout what's in line now and what is recommend--same thing when I worked with school lunches--trying to get them--cause I, I remember the lady say "Well, when I give them carrots and I give them so-and-so-and-so".  I said are any of them protein, you know?  You got to go through all of these and learn all of these things.  I had a pretty good technique working with them.  I tried not to hurt people cause I--you look at people trying to do their best they can and they're as wrong is two left shoes.  So you find a little way of getting to them without hurting their feelings, and that was my way of supervision right now.  And I'm still held in high esteem, I pat my own self now, in the way that I worked with them.  After I've labored all I can and, and you come in here and tell me you're exactly wrong and you so, so-and-so, you got to find a little way to butter it up.  To make them not feel out and then get them to the feeling that I see what you're talking about.  And then we had meetings from time to time, we got across as a group.  And you had to use a certain technique.  I always put myself in a place how would I feel.  And there's a way of doing things.  And I, I believe in working with them as humans, not as--because I got a higher grade than you.  Not to dog you, you still a human being just the way you were doing it.  And right now I have good rapport with many of those persons that I worked with, white and black.  'Cause at first we were just working with blacks and then I had an opportunity to work with the white.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you see things improve along the way?
Speaker 2: Yes and no.  I saw things improving and many things, but a whole lot of stuff comes in here now that is contrary to what we were taught.  And I don't think generally people are as dedicated, and they don't have to be as dedicated.  I don't mean everybody.  Some of the--well that's the way you want it, fine, we'll go that way.  But I, I had a pretty good little technique in way of working with people 'cause I still see people as people.  We may not--we still humans.  And I'd like to give everybody credit for what they're doing when they're doing it.  I had a love for the work and believed that they're doing right.  I'm not one who wants to dog anybody.
Story_ID: 166760
Speaker 1: I know that you've been involved in civic activity for a long time.  Did you have an example of that kind of activity in your household when you were growing up?  Did, your mother [Etta Shelton Cauthorne] and father [Robert Henry Cauthorne] get involved in community stuff?
Speaker 2: No, no.  Now my daddy was, Lord he would talk his talk.  He would be in a lot--but at that time they didn't have a lot of opportunities, you know, to, to say things and to become involved in.  Now as far as Civil Rights concerned and I'm not (unclear), but I'm part of it.
Speaker 1: And did you all receive some of the black newspapers at home when you were coming up?
Speaker 2: No.  When (unclear) and Afro-American [Baltimore Afro-American], when they came, they were the only two black papers and you know that we, we would get.  And--but I've always liked to--I've never want to be out here.  I've always been in here, if you--I, I don't think I'm making sense what I'm saying.  I want to be where the action is.  Now that I'm older, there are many times I have to back off some things because I see differently from what I did at one time.  But I have never been who wanted to be just belong.  I wanted to be a part of something, where the action is.  And I--now I'm not able to get up and do that; it bothers me a little bit, but I don't let it get the best of me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But in terms of those days, what inspired you to get involved in civic activities?
Speaker 2: Well I saw the way people were treated.  I, I saw where that could be a better day.  I saw where I would do better if I knew better.  That somebody needed to help somebody.  And I just felt like they say I work pretty well with people and I'm a people's oriented person.  I can't dog you because you don't think like I do.  Let's work it out and see what we can do.  And I think that's the thing that drew me to people and people to me, in working in organizations.  And I always had a lot of respect for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and the programs that they had and that they were actually trying to help people when I know that people out here who have not had a half a chance to do anything.  I just won--announced at church today.  I won a trip to Los Angeles [California].  And it's--I mean it was surprise to me.  But if you get out and become involved and involvement has been my thing.  I like to be right in there, not out here 'cause I can't--
Speaker 1: In the center, not on the peripheral.
Speaker 2: That's right.  And I--unless I know something 'bout it, I can't talk about it.  So I have been involved in a lot of activities and I think that a lot of people who have respected my opinion about things and have come to me that pulls me into involvement.  And involvement is my middle name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 166761
Speaker 1: Now was your husband [S.P. Morton] involved in a lot of activities too?
Speaker 2: He was involved, not as much as I was.  He was a principal of a black school, that sometimes--well even now, you got to watch your Ps and Qs, you know.  You got to know when to hold and when to fold.  So he was not as outgoing and his job did not do the way mine did.  But he was very supportive.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was not one of those--well like I say, he was principal of the high school [Hayden High School, Franklin, Virginia] and you know and the elementary school.  And in his job, man say you don't get an education and don't use no sense, you gotta use some of it.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And he had a family to look after.
Speaker 1: Now what was your husband's full name?
Speaker 2: Samuel Percell Morton.  Known as S.P. Morton, and the school is named for him here in Franklin [Virginia], S.P. Morton Middle School.  And--but he's been deceased seven years.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now for you--
Speaker 2: But he was not as outgoing as I was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 166762
Speaker 1: So you joined the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  Did you join it when you were in your twenties, or did you wait for a while, or how did--
Speaker 2: That's been so long, I don't know when I was twenty (laughter).  After all you know you're speaking of a ninety-something year old one now, you know.  But yeah, I, I have always--since I've been grown enough to know what it's all about, I have held membership.  And I, I have, you know full membership in it.  I'm not active like I used to be.
Speaker 1: Well now, but I'm talking about then.  We're talking about then.  We, we know you're not gone be as active.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then, and I don't know how I got along in that, but I sure did, right on through the days that I was right here in Franklin [Virginia] working.  But I did not, you know, go out on a limb.
Speaker 1: Now did, did you get a chance when you were young, when you were at college or high school, college or in your young adult life, did you get a chance to hear any of the national spokesmen for the NAACP or any of the Civil Rights leaders speak?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I, I did.  Because I, I went to some of the meetings and, and then now you know, everything is available now so I know what they are.
Speaker 1: So who, who did you hear in those days speak?
Speaker 2: Well Bennie Mays [Benjamin Mays] is one of my special persons, and can't recall any names now, but I used to go to the NAACP meetings and went to the state meetings too.
Speaker 1: Did you ever hear James Weldon Johnson speak?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And Dr. [W.E.B.] DuBois--
Speaker 2: That's right.  And left the job one time.  I was a state supervisor of home economics and they were having something at E.C. Glass High School up there in Lynchburg [Virginia], and we left and went up, and attended a meeting there to hear--I'm a person who like to hear it for myself.  I've always been that way 'cause if you gone tell me about the very thing I'm interested in, you'll think that's what you gone miss telling me.  So I like to go.  I'm a meeting person.  I like to hear it for myself.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Who else, I mean did, did you hear in those days?  Can you, can, can you remember any of the other people?  Remember what they said and what--how it might have affected you.
Speaker 2: No, not now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I was with the Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 1: Walter White, did you ever meet him?
Speaker 2: Not, not, not to meet him, know their name.
Speaker 1: Or Mary White Ovington.  Okay, yeah, did you know any of them very well?  I mean--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Any of the state officials well?
Speaker 2: Well in later years I did.  I can't recall some of those names now around Richmond [Virginia] after--Johnson and, and now the younger one, what was those younger ones?  Brothers up there in Richmond.  But I'm not keeping up with it now like I used to.
Speaker 1: Well I know.  I, I'm talking about back then.  'Cause the ones now, we, we could probably know about too.  But I'm asking you about what happened way back and just, just to get some sense of what those people were like and, and, and how you were inspired to do what you did.
Story_ID: 166763
Speaker 1: I worked--I was offered a job at the state, with the [Virginia] State Department of Education.  When I first went there, we didn't use the same toilet facilities that some of the other folks used 'cause we were black.  So you had to suffer some things.  We suffered some things and we were told to dress up and look good when you go to the superintendent's office and we had our procedures.  And we went to school, we went to the superintendent's office, the principal, you know you're going to be in the area working and what you're trying to do and that kind of thing.  And sometimes we had to stay.  We didn't--many times we had to stay in homes because hotels were not available for black folks, even right there in Roanoke [Virginia].  I remember now we had--I was the only black supervisor there.  And that whites and they'd say one of the kind persons said, white person said they hated so bad that we all couldn't leave the meeting at 5:00 and go and have dinner together or to work.  Thank God it's different now.  But when I was--during that time, you didn't.  So in my car I kept nabs and some cans of drinks or something like that to have so when I roll up to a place and they say sorry, we can't serve you 'cause you're black, then I had something.  So I, I was driving the state, so I knew there were places that I couldn't go and I didn't try to go.
Speaker 2: So you had to carry your own food around with you.
Speaker 1: Well they--you know we had--there weren't many places that were decent for women to go and stay.  And yet you had to do the job.  So I had over the period of years that I had worked for and I knew if I were in Farmville [Virginia] where I'm gone stay, in Richmond where I'm gonna stay and that kind of thing.  And at that time we did not have a hotel.  That they wouldn't take--one there in Norfolk [Virginia] said no I don't even want to hear talk of you being in that hotel, it doesn't have a good rep.  So I had to be careful and largely I stayed in homes.
Speaker 2: So how would you make those connections with relatives or friends?
Speaker 1: No.  The superintendent--if I didn't want--one I didn't know, or the principal.  I'm going to be in the area working at so-and-so-and-so and, and I would need night accommodations 'cause we didn't have many hotels.  Right there in Richmond we didn't have for people to stay and to get in and out.  And so at times--now like when I went to Roanoke, I stayed at the hotel, I mean later on.  At first I was working with school lunch then and my supervisor said she hated so much she was white.  And she'd been here, sat down at the table and ate and just a human being.  But the law was the law.  So many times I had to stay in homes, which I felt like I was inconveniencing some people, you know, by having to stay, but I had no choice.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 166764
Speaker 1: Can you tell me what were some of the issues that the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] had to deal with here in--or that you had to deal with as a black citizen of Franklin [Virginia] and the State of Virginia?
Speaker 2: I hadn't deal with none of it 'cause I was a member of the black--I paid.  And I ain't bragging, but I have been a respected citizen, and still am.  And I had some sense of my own.  There were things I would like to do, I didn't do because I knew better.  And you don't cut your own head off.  So I, I been cautious and right now, I know I'm well respected by the whites and the blacks.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I guess it's the way I've carried myself and I don't mind expressing what I have in my mind.  I try not to hurt people in giving, you know I'm saying.  Just chop your head off.
Speaker 1: Did you ever have to speak out about something that was wrong?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I've had to, you know I say well let's see what she's gonna say about it.  What is your opinion?  And I, I try not to be overbearing.  I try to see the whole picture.
Speaker 1: No, I mean as a citizen involved in civic activities, have you ever had to speak out about something that was going on that was, was wrong in terms of the way black people were treated here in, here in the state?
Speaker 2: (Nods head yes).  But it's generally accepted.  I think it's the way, way you go to people and way you say things.  I was taught not to get mad and fly off and I used to fly off like good.  You can get most things that you want by the approach that you give.  And I found that out.  And there are things that you got to wait for; you can't do 'em when you want to.  You got to wait for the time to come.  It's not time for her to say that now.  But a time will come.  An elderly lady who has been dead now quite a few years, she said "Pauline, time will take care of everything if you just have patience and wait."  That has stuck with me.  There are things that I have said that would not have taken at that particular point, it wasn't the time to say it.  And I had to be cautious and come back and say the very thing that you got on your mind.  But you can't do it with--and the regard for other people.  And I've learned that.  And I guess if I'm ever gone learn it, you get ninety-two years old, you ought to have some sense.  So--
Story_ID: 166765
Speaker 1: Did you know any of the civil rights lawyers that worked on the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] lawsuits, such as [HM] Oliver Hill or, or [HM] Charles Duncan or--
Speaker 2: Well now--
Speaker 1: Any of the people out, out of Howard [University, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Oliver Hill was a spokesman.  He said what he was gone say, but I think Oliver Hill had precautions in getting over what--I learned from a lot of things you can get what you want, you might not get it today, but if you have patience and wait and take a certain approach, you can get many things that you want; people will listen to you.  And if you're wrong, let 'em show you where you're wrong, and accept it with grace and go 'head about it.  In my eyes, say I voted against my own vote.
Speaker 1: What, what do you mean?
Speaker 2: Now I mean I have proposed something and then when somebody else showed me what was happening and how this would affect and that kind of thing, I could easily back off.  I wanted so-and-so, but I see where you're coming from.  And it's nothing like a conversation to explain things to you.  And I don't know what's in mind, I don't know what's in back or what's happening.  And I found out you can't do it by yourself; you've got to converse with other folks to find out what's actually happening and not be so hasty in making the decision.  I guess it takes years.  But that's where I, I've come.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you ever meet Charlie Houston?
Speaker 2: No, I know the name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I--course I know all of us remember Oliver Hill, can't help but remember him.  And some of those others.
Story_ID: 166766
Speaker 1: Now can you tell us when you were president of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] here in--
Speaker 2: Boy, oh boy, oh boy.
Speaker 1: Was it in the '50s [1950s] or the '60s [1960s], or--
Speaker 2: I suspect that I was in the '60s [1960s] when all the hell was going on.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  What--
Speaker 2: And, and I was work--now the NAACP here has gone down, gone down.  We're not doing what we ought to do.  But I have always felt that you can get across what you want; not going at it with a mad and that kind of thing, but it's usually take me to get in what you want.  NAACP--I was teaching when I was president of the NAACP here.  But I was cautious 'cause I had a job at stake and my husband had a job.  And they would throw all that back at you.
Speaker 1: Now what, what were some of the issues around here when you were the president of the NAACP?
Speaker 2: Use of certain facilities because--even take the library.  I don't know how I got on that library board at that time.  I was very aggressive at that time in trying to get into things and so on, and, and to have read some of the minutes and things that they had, you wouldn't have believed that human beings would say and do things like that.  But then I learned that was a custom.  And so you work yourself into it and I think right here now, and I don't know how, but I think generally, and I may be thinking wrong, but I think generally there is a more of an understanding among the whites and the blacks.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean you can sit down like we're talking now.  I can sit down with them and, and talk with them, or they can come look up, wanting to talk with you about something.  And sometimes I might be a feeler for what is because of the respect that I have.  And I'm not patting myself on the back.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now were there some things you were able to change like that, that you can tell us about?
Speaker 2: No, I can't pinpoint anything right now. I worked with the library here for a long time.  I was the beginner, well the beginner with a college board.  I worked with a college board in a number of ways; I'm off now.  I'm off of everything practically--not off with everything either, but I mean I have worked with it.  I know my opinion has been respected to a--you know because I, I try to see the whole thing, not one little segment of something.  And sometimes as I told the person, I have voted against my own proposal.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Because somebody has shown me and I can see what I didn't see.  And that's why I say you've got to get the picture of the whole thing; you can't get one little segment of it.  And get an understanding of it.  And that's been one of my ways here of late of not jumping to conclusion before let's see what's happening and what's doing.
Story_ID: 166767
Speaker 1: --I went downtown to talk with him about voting.
Speaker 2: The, who?
Speaker 1: And about working at polls, the city manager.
Speaker 2: Okay here at, in Franklin [Virginia].
Speaker 1: At that time, there were one or two people and they were the white people who worked at the polls and who did things.  And so when I had my little speech to go down there to talk to Harold Atkinson, who's now dead.  But when I got down there, he had everything outlined and he knew the whole story and everything.  So we went on without any--this was working at the polls, tallying and taking names and all that kind of thing.  So then they started working and all just as one body.  'Course now everything is different; machinery is doing everything now.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you're saying at that time they didn't let black people work on the polls and so forth?
Speaker 1: I don't know why they didn't, but very few.  I was one of the first to ask to work on the polls 'cause my granddaddy over therein Essex County [Virignia] and all hadn't been doing things like that.  And so I felt that--and, and so now they all work right there together as one body, whites and blacks together and they seem to get along well.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 1: Which I'm, you know I'm happy to see the improvement.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 166768
Speaker 1: Now you held--didn't you hold a national position with the association for, what is it, vocational education [sic, American Vocational Association, later, Association for Career and Technical Education]?  Right, well what was that title?
Speaker 2: Well that--no, I, I'm not national.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was with a state.  I served as president for several years with the vocational education and then I was hired by the state as a worker in vocational education.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, all right and you retired from--
Speaker 2: And it broadened my whole perspective, really.  I mean white people do things.  Right now you can't afford to go out and say certain things and do things even though you want to, you got to wait until the time is right for you to do it.  Then there are other times gone--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think that precaution is, is where we are and where we find people.  I don't find people hard to work with.  And I don't know whether the technique I'm using or whether, look, I want to pick your mind about something.  And I don't know what it is, unless it's the way you carry yourself and the way that somebody respects you as trying to be fair.  I, I've made a motion with something and then voted against my own motion after you showed me where I was wrong.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 166769
Speaker 1: I got another question that's kind of off the beaten track here.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I thought I'd ask it anyway.  We're here in Southampton County, Virginia, and I just wanted to know if people ever talk about the Nat Turner uprising in Southampton County [Virginia].  And--I mean if black people talk about it at all.
Speaker 2: It's just an accepted thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And at that time, as to what they did and there are certain markings in the state now that they--I mean in the county that they remember that.  But I think--I guess it's education that has made people change and, and, and see the whole picture rather than just a portion of it.  And, and so I believe, now I'm not saying that it isn't, but I'm, our race relations in my opinion, has changed greatly in Southampton County.  They are on--both races are on practically everything.  They seem to work together.  They're not afraid to go in the homes and work together.  And I'm not--now we not there, don't think that isn't some little things that might be going on and so on, but generally, I think it has improved and they see people as people for the most part.  They are on every board or commission that you have.  They may be some night meetings and so on that you don't know anything about; that goes with the territory, we all do that.  But I think that the way I see it, it's--it has improved.  Now I'm not saying there isn't more, and I do know that sometimes there are little meetings at night and that little meeting before the meeting, but if you got your eyes wide open, you can see.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 166770
Speaker 1: Ma'am, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: What are some what?
Speaker 1: Some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today.
Speaker 2: You know I wish that we could get to the point that we didn't see black and white.  We eat the same food.  Some of us go to the same doctors.  Some of us go to the same meetings and so in there.  And yet we can't get together.  And I'm hoping that we see more--that we don't carry this prejudice with us; that we just see we got a big something here that we've got to deal with and everybody got two cents in it.  And it's not gonna be that, we still have these little caucus.  We gone put this on and I know it.  And sometimes we defeat the purpose that we have when we do things like that.  But I personally feel like we have come a long way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And now a lot of people don't feel that way.   I am able to talk to white people.  For some reason I've gained the respect of a number of people.  And I could stand here and say I can't agree with you.  Show me why or tell me, without any hard feelings.  Your experience were different and your thoughts were different, your company was different and all of that.  But after we talk, I might agree with you totally and be against something else because we explain.  And I think now we, we have a--more of a point of understanding although there are a lot of people who feel like folks just trying to get something on you, gotta watch 'em.  Well I always say you can't use both them eyes, you better keep one eye looking when you--for everything.  You can't close both of them and, and, and think everything is going on.  But I really feel like our race relations here has improved greatly.
Story_ID: 166771
Speaker 1: Ma'am, when you look back on the things that you've done over your life, what would you consider at this point to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I don't know.  I probably don't have any.  I probably have any, yet I know I'm respected, for what, I don't know.  As I say, I have tried to be fair.  I have had business proposal with different races.  I have had friendly relationships--a girl who was my nurse and made me, what is that kind of banana nut bread and brought me for Thanksgiving.  I mean little things like that--that race relationships that I can see.  She didn't have to do it.  I was a patient.  And that's been several years ago, but she doesn't forget me.  I think that's meaningful.  Now I'm not hard hearted, and I see people as humans.  And I think it's that kind of thing that, that you know need to, to bring people together.  I can't come in your house 'cause this you're, you're a black woman.  I can't do so-and-so.  And I think across the board--we, now we got a long way to go.  And you don't work with both eyes shut, I mean you, you got to work with one of them eyes and see what's going on.  But I think generally we have a different--well the younger people are a little different anyway.
Speaker 1: Okay now--
Speaker 2: I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well in what way do you think they're different?
Speaker 2: I think they see people as people more than what we used to.  You can't do so-and-so, she's black, she's white, they're humans.  They're both humans.  They have the same needs and wants.  And when you try to cut off one, now course I know that's a broad perspective as far as I'm concerned 'cause a lot of people just got that division right there between the white and black and 'twain they will not meet.  But you have the same needs to spend the same money for the same thing and all of that kind of thing, and yet we can't come together.  And I, I really--I might be wrong, but I really feel like we are moving upward as far as race relations concerned.
Story_ID: 166772
Speaker 1: Tell me is there anything in life that you would do differently if you could do it over again?
Speaker 2: I'm sure, I'm sure.  I'm sure like you go to something, why didn't I say so-and-so?  I should have said so-and-so, I should have done so-and-so.  But generally, generally, I, I believe people are getting more on the same wavelength.  Which means that I know I have been wrong in judging people at times because when you get to know people and work with them and all, you get a different feeling.  I mean I have worked with these--with white people that I forgot they were white, you know what I'm saying?  You, you just--you have the same needs, the same wants and so on in there, but here's this little segment over here and here's this a little segment here.  And they working against each other, wasn't working together, which I don't see the need for.  But I'm only one.  And I don't, I don't know.
Story_ID: 166773
Speaker 1: Ma'am, there's one last question.  And that is how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: When I die (laughter)?  I would say listen, I would want to be remembered as a fair person.  I would want to be remembered of seeing people as human beings with the same needs and the same goals.  You always want the money.  All of us want somewhere to live and we call our own.  All of us--none of us want to live by ourselves; we live in a world where this thing you can get here and this thing you can get here, and I want to be able to go there and forget color.  Just go and get what I need.  I don't--we'll ever come to that; that's always gonna be some prejudice.  But I would love to see us all on one wavelength, and that is to live and live the best that we can.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I, I don't have--you and I both got some white blood in us, you know that.  You do all that you want, I know where mine were.  But--and thank God for it that we, you know, you, you, you not in this world alone.  But I would hope to see that we wouldn't have to always make race an issue.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I really would like to see that.  We have the same needs and the same wants.  And we live in a world using the same facilities.  You might be able to get more of some of the things that you want than I can get.  But I might not need all of 'em either.  So I mean our opportunities are out there, but it's man and man's mind that keeps us apart.  And that's what I believe keeps down real progress.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause we're working against each other.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 166774
Speaker 1: Would you like to say something about your daughters before we--
Speaker 2: Well like what now?
Speaker 1: I don't know--
Speaker 2: I have two daughters.  Jean and Audrey.  One is northern Virginia, and the other one is in Los Angeles [California].  Neither one is as outgoing and working outside as much as I am 'cause sometime they say, "Well Mama, why don't you sit down and not worry 'bout, let so-and-so-and-so do."  They both went to college.  One finished Hampton Institute [sic, Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], and the other one finished down there in the south, I have two daughters, granddaughters in college now.  And they right with their mother.  They want--I mean I'm talking 'bout me.  They have a very concern as to what's happening with me and they don't--they encourage me to go on and live my life, being a part of the community and they don't worry 'bout nothing, but it's okay to become involved in these different activities and so.  Although neither one--one's on the east coast and the other one the west coast.  But they want me to live my life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right well thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Well you're welcome.  And I don't know what good I've been.  I've talked a whole lot.
Speaker 1: Well that's what it was about.
Speaker 2: And it's--and I, I you know I'm serious when I say I wish we could, could get to the point that we didn't have to make race an issue in so many things.  We have the same human wants and desires.
Story_ID: 166775
Speaker 1: (Sneezes) Listen hand it to me here.  Can't I see it?  It shocked me so when--where the devil all this came from?  The American Vocational Association (later, Association for Career and Technical Education (ACTE)].
Speaker 2: Convention, that's in 1956 in St. Louis.
Speaker 1: In St. Louis, Missouri.
Speaker 2: It's on the back.
Speaker 1: And, and these were delegates who went from--Some people were officers.  And I see about four of them dead now who at one time were--and we went as a group. There were two blacks and two whites in here that were judges for this particular affair.
Speaker 2: We had a little program and we were judges for they call it, I think the Chalk-In here in Franklin [Virginia], and I was a judge.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA CONVERSATION)
Speaker 2: I'd say this was in the early '60s [1960s]. That's so (unclear) I can hardly tell what that is.  They were--
Speaker 1: That's your daughter's wedding.
Speaker 2: They--that was my oldest daughter's wedding here in Franklin.
Speaker 1: Who are these people from left to right?  Tell us this one.
Speaker 2: If I got 'em closer, I'd see 'em, but I can't tell.  Can you let me have that.
Speaker 1: Hold on one second.  I've got another copy of it.  From left to right.
Speaker 2: This one right here is--this was at my daughter's wedding, and she's marrying this fella right here.  This is Jean and that's Roscoe [PH.]. And to her right--

Speaker 1: Pauline is you.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And this right here is Roscoe's father.
Speaker 1: Okay and mother?
Speaker 2: And mother.  No, that ain't his mother, I don't know who in the devil that is.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I hope you didn't record what said.
Speaker 1: We didn't.
Speaker 2: Okay, but that was Jean.
Speaker 1: do you remember what year your daughter got married?
Speaker 2: Must have been '40 [1940].
Speaker 1: It might be on the back. Okay, how 'bout this photo here ma'am, up on your chair.
