 Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Today is Monday, January 8, 2007, and I am in Tulsa at the home of  Peggy Daugherty, and my name is Jennifer Paustenbaugh. I   m from the  OSU Library, and Peggy is an OSU alum who has agreed to be  interviewed for our O-STATE Stories Project and, so, we   re really  grateful to you, Peggy, for your willingness to spend an hour or so  visiting with us about some of your experiences at OSU. When we  started this project, we started it during Homecoming so we had     Yes.     lots of alums that were coming back to campus and were sharing their  experiences with us about OSU   s Homecoming so could you tell us a  little bit about your memories of Homecoming, what the things were that  you were involved with and what campus was like and the town was  like?  Well, Homecoming was always exciting because there were always a lot  of people that you didn   t see any other time. Of course, whenever I was  on campus, we saw all of them   our friends were all among them, but  after we left campus, it was fun to go back to Homecoming.  One of my experiences about Homecoming, in 1940 I went from high  school   went down for Homecoming and to have a car up on campus  then was really a big thing. So I drove down and my sister was in school  there   she was a sophomore, and I   m from Ramona, and Ramona is not  a very big town and not very many people attended school and college.  But we loaded up a whole bunch of the kids that Betty  Peggy   s sister   knew and that I knew, and we all went to the pep rally and, of course, for  somebody from small-town Oklahoma, and not even a college student,  that was really exciting to be there. Among the people from Ramona that  ganged up with us whenever we went to the pep rally was a fella named  Lou Daugherty. Lou was a freshman. He was older than I was, and I had  5  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  known who he was in high school but, you know, in high school, the  juniors and seniors never even speak to the freshmen and sophomores.  But the next day we ran into him again when we went to the parade, and  so he said,    Would you like to go to the dance with me tonight?    So I  went to the Homecoming dance and gee that was really something. The  next day he stopped by on his way home from church and took me over  to Cordell Hall for lunch and, as I was leaving town he said to me,    You  know I don   t hear from people from Ramona very much. Why don   t you  write to me?    So I had a class with his brother just before lunch every  day and so I thought,    This will be great. Bob and I can write him some  notes,    and it ended up that I married him. (Laughter) Several years  later, we were married in 1949     That was a good pick-up line, wasn   t it? (Laughter)  Right. Yes, worked great.  Well, tell me about the dance. What was that like? Was it a formal dance  or     No, it wasn   t a formal dance. It was just   a lot of the people that were  there were still in the clothes that they   d worn to the ballgame, and at  that time there wasn   t as many shirts and clothes that had the logo of any  kind on them, but some of them had on orange. It was a fun dance and I  think they had a   I really can   t remember, but I think they had a dance  band for the dance. It was fun and exciting for a high school girl anyway  to get to go to that.  Oh, sure. Now you attended, actually it was Oklahoma A M College     Yes.     at that point and you attended when?  I started in the fall of 1941 and graduated in 1945. You know, because  of the war so many people left school, but it never occurred to me to  leave school and take a job some place. A lot of students left and then  went back after the war, but I was on scholarship and didn   t want to lose  the scholarship, so I stayed until I graduated. One year, after my  sophomore year, they tried a trimester and they were gonna have three  semesters instead of two, so I stayed down there that summer and went  to summer school. Actually I think I had about 140 hours when I  graduated, but I had a good time in college so I wasn   t in any hurry to  get away.  You mentioned that you had an older sister that also attended school.  6  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Did she graduate?  She graduated. Betty was in dietetics and she worked in a hospital as a  dietician. She had to take an internship and she went into the Army and  was out in Colorado and did the internship out there. She was in the  Army for a couple of years after that until the war was over and no  longer needed, and then she worked in hospitals as a dietician. But she  married a man from Colorado University that she met while she was in  Denver, and she never did live in Oklahoma again after that     Oh, okay.     but she was the one that was really interested in learning something at  college. I was interested in having a good time. (Laughter)  Did you have any other siblings that attended?  No, just Betty and me.  Now what about your parents? Were either of them college educated?  My mother was. I don   t think my father was. Mother was a  schoolteacher before she and Daddy got married, and Daddy worked for  the Barnsdall Oil Company, and Mother didn   t teach anymore after they  were married. My daddy had a stroke the year just before I started to  grade school. Way back then we didn   t have kindergarten and he was no  longer able to work. So, they bought a general store   I   ll tear up about  this   bought a general store at Oglesby. Oglesby was about   there are  about twenty-five houses, and they stayed there. Daddy passed away and  Mother stayed and ran the store until I got out of school, and I graduated  in May and she sold the store in September. (Laughs) She never did do  anything after that except run around and have a good time.  Well she deserved that.  Absolutely.  What a wonderful thing that they were willing to   well, and especially  her, through those years, to continue to operate that store so that you  and your sister had a chance to get an education.  An education. Just recently   Oglesby is in Washington County, and just  recently Washington County has put out a big history book and Mother  is written up in it, and you should read the story of her life after she was  in Oglesby and ran that store.  7  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Now is that a town that still exists?  It still exists. There   s still about twenty-five houses there. I think most of  the people work in Bartlesville and drive back and forth. It   s about, I  think, around fifteen miles into Bartlesville. Betty and I always thought  it was real great to live in Oglesby because Bartlesville is about fifteen  miles, Nowater was about fifteen miles, and Ramona was about eight,  and we could date fellas from all three. (Laughter)  It really expanded your horizons. (Laughter)  It did. You   re right. But we went to school at Ramona and rode a school  bus and always had a good time on the bus, too. (Laughs) It wasn   t like  it is today     That makes a big difference. Well, did you consider going to anyplace  else beside Oklahoma A M?  No. Back then, everybody from Oklahoma City north went to Oklahoma  A M, and everybody from Oklahoma City or Oklahoma City south  went to OU. One thing was logistics.  Sure.  You know, having transportation back and forth to the schools was kind  of a problem for a lot of people. If you were going to be a doctor or be in  the medical field, you went to OU     Sure.     but otherwise most everybody went to Oklahoma A M.  So now you said that your sister went to learn and you went to have fun,  and yet I know that you worked really hard while you were on campus,  but also had some fun doing it.  Right.  Tell me about your career with The Redskin. Was that     With The Redskin... Accidental. (Laughs) One day I was over in the  office taking something that   for one of the organizations that I  belonged to for The Redskin, and Gordon Kassad was the editor of The  Redskin, and Gordon said to me,    Peggy, why don   t you come and help  us out some?    And I said,    Yeah, okay, I could do that.    I had no idea or  ever intended to do anything in publications, have a career in  8  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  publications, but I started helping them and getting the pictures and  going with them when the photographer was gonna do the pictures and  getting everybody   s name and hoping we got them right     Right. (Laughs)     and Gordon   the war came and Gordon was called up to go to the  service, and the girl that worked downstairs in the publication office was  named Dorothy Drew, and Dorothy Drew and I worked on The Redskin  then and finished it for that year. Elmer Woodson was the publications  director, and he was a lot of help and gave us a lot of encouragement.  Everything was slow getting done with the people that were doing the  printing and turned out that Dorothy and I went to Iowa City, Iowa on a  train     Wow.     to read The Redskin and be sure that everything was all right, and of  course I   m sure we made some errors, but not many. (Laughter)  So that was where it was being printed     Yes.     and you got to look at the proof before they ran all the copies?  Yes. There was a man from here in town that was really in charge of  getting everything organized and together, but it was printed in Iowa  City. So at the end of the year I had fun doing it and thought that I would  enjoy working on it again the next year. I applied to be the editor in my  senior year, which was 1944 and 45, and probably nobody else asked if  they could or applied   anyway I was selected to be the editor of it that  year and     And you were the first woman to be the editor, right?  Yes, and there just weren   t very many men around on campus. There  were a lot of men, but they were   there were servicemen mostly. There  were some of the fellas that were still left, but not very many. In 1941,  we got involved in the war and just recently I   ve received something  from   on the computer about the memorial that they have put in  Washington and this is   I have a copy over there   you might like to  read it. The lady, older woman, that was reading it said,    Well, they   ve  left out    In God We Trust    on the bottom of it,    and she was really upset  about that. I remember when Roosevelt was gonna declare war and the  classes were all   you were excused from class and everybody was  9  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  encouraged to go to Gallagher Hall to hear over the radio the speech that  he made and the declaration of war, and it scares me that things like  that   I really hadn   t even thought about it in years, but then when that  came up or when I got that on the computer, it reminded me of it and I  thought that was interesting that we had gone on   just paraded to  Gallagher Hall to hear that.  So what was the reaction of the student body?  Well, I think that everybody anticipated that it was gonna happen and so  a lot of the fellas especially were in the ROTC  Reserve Officer Training  Corps  program and     Now was that still required at that time?  Yes, and so they knew that they would be called, and a lot of them were.  A lot of the units were called and eventually most everybody was   most  of the men that were there were off campus. But we had a lot of  servicemen in programs, and women too   the WAVES  Women  Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service  were     Right, I was going to ask you if you had any interaction with the women  that came here   because they came about 1943, I thought, to train.  They started   they came        or maybe    42?  They probably   yes, in 1942, and the men also, but we had very little  with the women, but a lot with the fellas and    (Laughs)  Were there like dances and ways that you could interact socially with  them?  Yeah.  Okay.  A lot of them you got acquainted with at that or just on campus it     because they   d have some free time and maybe end up at some of the  places where you work or you were hanging out between classes,  hopefully not cutting classes, but between classes.  Yeah. (Laughter) I thought it was really interesting that, you know, a  couple of years ago we commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of Henry  G. Bennett   s death, and I spent a lot of time reading about his  10  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  presidency, and it was very interesting to me how he had developed all  of these really wonderful connections in Washington so that when the  war was declared, the university was really ideally situated to react and  become a     Yes.     a training hub.  And the women were moved out of the dormitories and lived in the  fraternity houses     Okay.     because the fraternities were   and the men were moved out of  Cordell at first and they had to move to Hanner or Thatcher, which were  older and not as large, but then eventually they had to move from some  of those smaller dormitories, too   and out in town. All the time that I  was in college I lived in town. I didn   t ever live in the dormitories.  Now why was that?  Well, with my sister it was more economical really     Since she was already established then someplace?     and she was living in a house. This was a house that   there were  three bedrooms that six girls stayed in, and the woman that owned the  house sort of used the back part of the house. We shared the kitchen, and  really she never did use the living room and dining room very much  because her kids were grown and gone, and so we had access to it.  I had a scholarship by the college that I could have stayed in the dorm,  but I had a better scholarship from a banker in Washington County  (Laughter) and I could have taken both of them, but I felt like   one  thing, I wanted to be where Betty was and so I stayed in housing all the  time, but the year that we had   there were six of us that lived in the  house, and two of them   the girl that I roomed with, and I didn   t even  know whenever I moved there, was a second year and she was on some  kind of a secretarial program that just took two years     Okay.     and one of the other girls dropped out. She was a junior, and she     well she didn   t drop out of school, she stayed in school, but she didn   t  come back, and she got married and left, and so there were four of us  11  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  left. So we moved to another house, and we had been there about maybe  mid-October when the woman that owned the house said,    Girls, you   re  gonna have to move. I   m going to Guthrie to work in the tent factory.     Oh. (Laughter) And that was part of the war effort?  Yes, so we tried to find a place and at the same time that we were doing  this, the girls were moving into the fraternity houses and the fellas were  scrounging around trying to find someplace to live, either in one of the  smaller dorms or anyhow to vacate Cordell. So we found this apartment  that was a two-bedroom apartment and there was a single woman that  lived downstairs, and so Dean Stout agreed to make her our house  mother and we could live upstairs. There were two apartments upstairs  and two apartments down, and so the four of us moved into one   got  acquainted with the girls that were living in the other side and when the  year was over, two of the women that were in the apartment with me  graduated, my sister and another one, and two of the women across the  hall graduated, so the ones across the hall moved in with us.  Okay.  Still had four people in the two-bedroom apartment, and all of us knew  each other and   we didn   t know all of our idiosyncrasies, but we knew  each other. (Laughter)  You got to learn about those idiosyncrasies. (Laughter) So do you still  keep in touch with any of the people that you were in living  arrangements with during college?  Well, some of them have passed away. One of them lives in Broken  Arrow and is having her eightieth birthday in a couple of weeks, and  I   ve been invited to her birthday party.  How wonderful.  I see her occasionally, and I got acquainted with her husband before     while we lived in Oklahoma City, we got acquainted with him and  Tina   and so I still see and hear from her a lot. But really she   s the only  one. No there   s one in Bartlesville, Dorothy, that we kind of exchange  Christmas cards and birthday cards. If I   m in Bartlesville I drop by to  see her, but she   s a single woman, too. Her husband   s deceased     Okay.     and she   s two or three years older than I am and doesn   t get around  much anymore. (Laughs)  12  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Well, you mentioned that Dean Stout was the one who approved your  living arrangement, and she had a very long history with the university  and was highly regarded. Did you have any dealings with her at all?  A few encounters.  Okay. (Laughter)  Dean Stout   everybody was afraid of Dean Stout. She had that  appearance.  Well she looked like she could be pretty formidable. (Laughter)  Right, and if you were called into Dean Stout   s office you knew you  were in big trouble. When I was gonna be the editor of The Redskin, she  called me in and wanted to talk to me about it and hoped that I would be  a good representative for the women. (Laughter) Then one time when I  was already into the campus politics, and I was the secretary treasurer of  the student association and I was active in the home economics club, and  there was an organization for the women that lived off campus to have  meetings so that you kind of kept up with what was going on, on  campus, and I was active in that. Anyhow she called me in once and she  said,    Peggy, I just don   t think that you can handle all the activities that  you   re in and still be a good student, so I would really like for you to  consider not running for president of the YWCA  Young Women   s  Christian Association .    (Laughter)  So was that the off-campus student or     This was a group on campus, no.  So this wasn   t like the association that united off-campus women, this  was the regular YWCA organization.  Women.  Okay.  But she says,    I just really would like to ask you not to.       But you know  your name gets popular     Sure.     and so people start to vote and they look down the list, just like we do  today, and they say,    Oh, I   m familiar with that name. I   ll just vote for  her.    (Laughter)  13  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  So you mentioned the student association. Was that like the student  government association?  Yes.  And so   and you were the secretary of that?  I was the secretary treasurer of the association for, I think, two years. I  used to say that not only was I on scholarship, but I had the only two  paying jobs (Laughter) that you could get without having to do very  much.  Was that a paying job?  That was a paying job.  Oh, okay, how interesting. Now was that a position that typically had  been held by other women prior to you?  No, probably not, but usually the people that were elected to the offices  for all campus office that included everything on the campus, the men  were the ones that were elected and it was usually the fraternity men     Sure.     that were because they were better organized than the independents.  But our junior and senior year, there were more independents really that  were active on the organizations that held the whole campus offices.  I think we think of World War II as a time that really opened up a lot of  occupational fields to women, even if only temporarily, but sometimes  they don   t think about all the opportunities that were opened up on  campuses because of there not being so many male students, so you  really thrived in that environment.  Well, I was a home economics major and I was majoring in fashion  merchandising and so there wouldn   t have been much competition from  fellas anyway.  Right. (Laughter)  I want to tell you about my mother. You know, after your sophomore  year well you have to declare your major and whatever school you   re in,  and so when my sister came home and said she was going to be a  dietician   and we had this great big long living room, and I can  remember Mother walking from one   the windows on one side to the  14  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  windows on the other and saying,    I just don   t know what you   ll do with  a degree in dietetics. I can   t help you. I can   t do anything to help you  with a degree in dietetics. You   ll probably just have to go back to school  and get a degree in education.    (Laughter) And then when I came home  and said I was going to major in fashion merchandising, here we went  again back and forth.    I just don   t know what you   ll do with a degree in  fashion merchandising. I can   t help you. (Laughter) Looks like to me  you   ve served the public in merchandising all your life. It looks like to  me that you would have not wanted to get involved in that again.    Well,  of course Betty went into the service and got her internship and worked  as a hospital dietician     And I   m sure she never had a bit of trouble finding a job.  No, that   s right. And I was required to   for a six weeks course off  campus, why you had to get a job   this was my junior year     So what did you do?  Well, I went to work for Sears and I worked in their ladies    department.  This was a contract at that time. The Sears stores all were contract ladies  apparel, and so I took the job and I had been in Tulsa for about a week  on the job. The man who was in charge of it came in and said he wanted  to talk to me and he said,    We   re having some problems with thievery in  Kansas City, and we   re gonna send you to Kansas City to do the rest of  your internship.     Oh, wow.  So     I   ll bet that was a surprise. (Laughter)  Yes, and exciting.  Yeah.  This is my senior year really, and so anyhow I went to Kansas City and  stayed for six weeks and did the internship. Fortunately, it was close to  the end of school. The yearbook was already put to bed and in Iowa City  and I did the six-weeks internship there. So whenever I got   it was  getting near time for college   school to be out   there were people that  came on campus to interview you, and so Mr. Pride called me and said,     You   re not gonna interview for anybody, are you? You   re coming to  work for Sears?    And I said,    No, I   m gonna see what else is out there.     So the only other interview really that I had was with a man from down  15  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  in Texas that was looking for somebody to be on the radio   to do radio  work, and I thought,    Gee, that would be fun and exciting to do that.     And then Mother was saying to me,    I   ll send you, if you want to go to  New York and study further.     Well, I   d studied long enough and so anyhow I took the job with Sears,  and at that time they had this program that you   there were six stores  that he was over, and you spent three months at each store, Tulsa,  Oklahoma City, a couple of them in Texas, Kansas City and   I don   t  remember, but anyway he said,    Well, you come to Tulsa and we   ll start  and you   ll have three months there.    And so then it was time for school  to be out and I didn   t hear from him anymore, and I thought,    Gee, I  wonder what   s happened? I wonder if I   m really gonna get that job.     And I came home and there was a letter there, and they said that they  had fired the lady that was the manager of the department in Oklahoma  City and I   d go there as a manager.  Wow.  So I think I worked for them for about two years     So you never did get to rotate through all the stores?  No. I went to Oklahoma City as the manager of it, and I stayed there for  about two and a half years and then I went over and worked with the  buyer at old John A. Brown Company, which was   John A. Brown and  Brown Duncan were associated with each other, so   and by then we had  children and I didn   t work again until we were in Tulsa, and I got  involved in that gift shop. (Laughs)  So you worked for awhile after you were married then?  About five years.     which was a little bit unusual for that time period, wasn   t it?  Right, but so many of the fellas were coming home from the service and  this was   Lou, the man that I met, or that I got acquainted with, that I  had the first date with when I went to Stillwater, came home in  September and we were married in November. When he came home,  now he was an officer with the ROTC, and then when he came home, he  was on a sixty-day leave and was leaving Europe and going to the  Pacific. While on the way home, the war with Japan ended and so when  he got home, there was,    What are we gonna do with all these fellas?     So he had to go back to the east coast to get discharged, and then when  he came back, we got married.  16  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  So was he deployed from 1942 to 1945   overseas from    42 to    45?  Yes, he was overseas all that time and he was wounded. He was  wounded just before the Battle of the Bulge and so they moved him to a  field hospital and, I think, after the third one, they sent him to England  and he was in the hospital in England then for about six weeks, and so  then he was on his way back, and on the way back, he was on one of  these trains that   s      forty and eight,    they called them, forty men or  eight cows. (Laughter) And so he was   it was his turn to nap and  somebody hung their helmet up above him and it fell and hit him in the  nose and broke his nose, and so he was back in a field hospital for just a  few days and on to Germany then. And he was in Germany when the  war ended.  You all had already experienced so much of life by the time you got  married, not necessarily like people today that haven   t had those kinds  of experiences.  Right. Well, we had a lot of fun when we were on campus and  fortunately I got an education, too. (Laughter) That was the plus, but  when I was in Stillwater, the corner where Eskimo Joe   s is     Yes.     now was Swim   s     Right.     and there was a dance floor there that about eight couples could dance  and booths   not booths really, tables with benches around it. A lot of  times if you had a class   and between classes, you could go over to get  a Coke and dance awhile, and always after the football games everybody  piled in there. Then there was Miles Student Store up on the other corner  of the campus up by the fire station and it had a dance floor, too, and  really that was a fun place to go. But another place that was always  interesting was the Y Hut.  Yes.  The Y Hut was on campus. It was really right close to the Home  Economics Building, and a lot of times if you had some time off   like  you   d have an 8:00 class and then you wouldn   t have another one until  11:00 and you   d have a couple of hours to waste, you   d go over there for  a cup of coffee and there was always a bridge game going on, and as you  came in somebody was having to leave to go to class.  17  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  So you would just pick up their hand? (Laughter)  Sit down and start and you   d stay until you had to go to class and there  was always somebody coming in or hanging around waiting to get to  play, and maybe two or three of the booths would be full of people  playing cards and having a good time between classes. The couple that  ran that   I wish I could remember their names.  They were blind, weren   t they?  They were legally blind, yes, and he stayed in the back area and took the  money most of the time   and this was a man and wife, and she was the  one that kept our coffee cups filled and sold the Cokes and whatever     but that was a fun place and it was a good place to kill an hour if you  had an hour between classes.  It looks like you never had any trouble finding something fun to do.  Besides dances and bridge games, were there other things that you did  as entertainment?  Oh, went to a movie occasionally but there wasn   t a movie on campus or  anything. There was one up by Miles, the student store, but then you   d  have to go downtown to   fortunately this apartment house that I lived in  was about halfway to     The downtown?     to downtown. So it was convenient for your date to pick you up or the  girls that you were going with, whoever. We   d meet at the apartment  building and go on downtown to the movies and maybe get a burger.  One thing fun about that apartment house   everybody was popular,  everybody dated. A lot of times we   d be not all dating   somebody  would be dating a sailor and somebody would be dating somebody that  was in the ASTP program and     Now what   s the ASTP?  Army Specialized Training Program.  Okay.  This was a small group that were there and they lived in the fire station,  up in the fire house, and some of them had been on campus as students  and some of them hadn   t, but they were probably gonna be engineers in  the service and they were higher trained or taking higher training  programs, but everybody would end up   the movie was over and you  18  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  were back at the house and we didn   t have to close the apartment until  12:00, and so the fellas would all come up and hang out with us, too, and  you got acquainted with a lot of people that you wouldn   t have met  otherwise. Some of the servicemen were   a lot of them were college  men that had been called up just like the men from our campus had, so  we met a lot of people. But as you notice all this time I   m talking about  this, we never did have any interchange with the WAVES. They were   I  guess they were probably over playing and having a good time with     The fellas? (Laughs)     the sailors that we weren   t dating at the time. (Laughter)  You just mentioned the fact that you had to close your apartment at  midnight, so does that mean that the same rules that applied for on-campus  housing applied to off-campus housing?  Yes.  That   s very interesting. Was that the designated house mother   s  responsibility to enforce that or     I suppose it would   ve been.  The honor system     Yeah. Yeah, probably we were on the honor system, but she worked on  campus. She had a job and worked on campus and she probably was  thirty-five maybe. She wasn   t an older woman like the ones that we had  been in their homes before. But when we first went to school, or when I  did, there was a fella named   oh, Jimmy Baker     Oh, right.     that had a dance band and he played for a lot of our dances. Jimmy  was also the drum major at the football games. When the band marched  at the football games, they   d start at the west end and march all the way  down and then do some configuration in the center of the field, but as  they came on the field, Jimmy always wore one of those big Shako hats  and a plume on top of it, and as they marched down the field, he strutted  and bent back far enough that the feathers on that plume would hit the  ground. He was really a show, and everybody would always be excited  about Jimmy and the performance that he did. And then he played where  he had the dance band, and several years later I met and got well  acquainted with one of his sisters in Oklahoma City. Jimmy had gone to  Hollywood and worked as a producer out there, and that   s what he was  19  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  doing at that time, but that   s probably been several years ago. I don   t  know what happened to him after that.  He had a really long career in Hollywood, and I think he passed away a  couple of years ago, but you know I   ve heard lots of Jimmy Baker stories  over the years. He was a colorful character.  Yes. There was another fella named Jim Wilkerson that had a band, and  then later there   I can   t remember the other man   s name, but we  eventually got no band and at my house in Oglesby we had a big radio  with a record player on it and Mother let me have that record player  taken out and I took it to Stillwater and that   s what we used to play the  records for the dances and     Oh, okay.     for a couple of years probably. I don   t remember whether I got the  record player back whenever I was out of school or not, but it wasn   t  gonna be important to me anymore. (Laughter) But the dances that the  independents had were all over at the Armory and occasionally decorate  for them   most of the time not, but there were a lot of the fellas from  the service that would be there and you could get acquainted with them  and maybe even have some dates with them later after you met them  there.  Well, let me ask you a couple of questions about the buildings on the  campus.  Okay.  I know that when you were a student that the Student Union hadn   t been  built yet     No.     and the library   the new   the Edmon Low Library     That was the new library.  Right   had not been built yet, but there was obviously a library   but are  there any campus buildings that you hung out in or that you have a  particular memory of   like where was The Redskin put together?  Well, The Redskin   oh, where was it? There was a Publications  Building     20  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Okay.     it   s not there anymore, and I don   t really remember, or I don   t know  whether there was a name for those streets or not but it was on the corner  and across the street was where all the architects hung out     Okay.     and there was a cafeteria on campus then for the men that lived in the  dormitories that didn   t have food service in them, and Hanner and  Thatcher were the two that I recall that were that way. But the  Publication Building   there was an area then and then the Chemistry  Building was on the south of it, and I think all of those buildings have  been replaced. The Home Economics Building was north of it, but it  wasn   t on the corner.  You know, I think that   s the building that when I got to campus was  called Home Economics East and was taken down.  There     I mean, like it was taken down sometime in the early to mid-nineties.  Well, there   s been a new Home Economics Building     Right, over on the west side of campus.      a lot longer than that, and I think Stout Hall was pretty new and  Cordell Hall was pretty new, and they   re both still there.  Yes.  And I think Murray and North Murray are still there.  Yes, they are.  And Theta Pond is still there, where a lot of people got engaged.  Yes. (Laughter) Where they got thrown into Theta Pond at some other  point in their dating relationship with someone. I don   t know if you   ve  been there recently, but it   s really been cleaned up and the walkways  and bridges have been refurbished and it looks really nice.  Well, one of the things that you always knew about Oklahoma A M     when you began to smell the fertilizer, you knew spring was coming.  (Laughter)  21  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Well, there are still some days when you could probably say that.  (Laughter)  And I don   t think that the President   s Building, house, is there anymore  either. It was a white frame     Right, now that   s where the Bennett Memorial Chapel was built, on top  of that building.  You know, (Laughs) Dr. Bennett did a lot for OSU, for Oklahoma  A M. He was to the Oklahoma A M what Boren is to OU now. I think  that although he had not been in politics, he was a good politician, and  he was effective and really doing a lot to help Oklahoma A M at the  time that he was the president.  I think that   s a really good analogy, comparing us to them.  He, while I was editor of the Redskin I was in his office a time or two      (Laughter) But one time he said to me,    You know, Peggy, our  enrollment is not so great here, and you probably have a good idea about  how many we have on campus but I   d really rather that you didn   t  discuss that or publicize that any.    He was wanting to make it look like  it was better     Well, I think everybody was hurting at that time for students     Oh, yeah.     with so much of the population not, that was that age not there.  Yeah, they were in service.  You graduated in 1945, so the name change for the university happened  about twelve years after you graduated. How did you feel when it  changed from OAMC to OSU?  Well, I hoped it would make a difference in the college, that it would  bring it up to having more prestige than it did, and it really was not  anymore an agriculture college. What we have in the state isn   t as  effective as it was because there just aren   t as many people that are  interested in that career. When I was in school, a lot of the kids that were  there were 4H Club or FFA  Future Farmers of America  and they were  gonna go back and work in the same programs or do something about  either livestock or feed for them, things like that.  So their goal was to learn how to farm better and to go back and farm  22  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  their family farm pretty much.  And I don   t think that was beginning to not happen. I have a cousin who  went to OSU and then he went on out to Davis in California and finally  got his doctor   s, and he had majored in grasses and legumes, they called  it, and what he has done his whole career is try to improve grasses for  golf courses.  Well    (Laughter) yeah, turf management, that   s the money-making field  if you   re into grasses, I think.  Well, and I   m sure there are others that found careers in something  different from what they thought they were gonna do whenever they  started out.  Well, sure. And so when you graduated, have you been in Oklahoma  ever since?  Yes.  Okay.  I was in Oklahoma City working on that job that I had gotten. My  husband hadn   t finished college yet. So he   d come back to Oklahoma  City on the weekends, ride the bus back to Oklahoma City on the  weekends and go back to college then on Sunday night or early Monday  morning until he graduated. He had to go a semester in the summer to  graduate, and he was an accountant and he worked in Oklahoma City  and then he took a job in Cushing, and when he took the job as the office  manager of the drilling company in Cushing, I stopped working and I  didn   t work while we lived in Cushing. Then eventually we moved back  to Oklahoma City, and by then we had children and then he worked for  Amoco in production and they transferred us here, and then I got  involved in that gift shop accidentally.  So tell me about that gift shop because you showed me your wonderful  Christmas decorations earlier, and I don   t know if anything that   s in this  wonderful OSU room was part of your gift shop days or whether these  were other things that you   ve collected outside of that.  This was really mostly things that people have given to me     Okay.  About five years ago when we were having the inside of the house  painted, we were gonna have this room that we had been using for an  23  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  office and so I said,    I   m just gonna have them paint this orange and  have an OSU room,    and of course the painter says,    You   re painting  that orange?    (Laughter) So this is what we ended up with, but the  banner up here is from the Cotton Bowl that     I want to see if I can turn the camera so that it will   let   s see if we can  get some of it   oh okay, the one that   s right in the center of my frame     In the center of the frame   is from the Cotton Bowl and     And did you go to that?  Yes, my roommate, who I   m gonna go and visit for her eightieth  birthday, she and I and our mothers went to the Cotton Bowl and     Let me see if I can pan around here        we had dates with the fellas that we   d met from El Paso, Texas that  were in some kind of a   or San Antonio that were in some kind of an  Air Force program, so we had dates with them and went to the ballgame  and cheered, and we won. Bob Fenimore was the quarterback and Neill  Armstrong was the end who caught all of his passes     Oh, right.     did great with that. Interestingly, when we were staying at the Baker  Hotel and that was really the headquarters for the OSU   Oklahoma  A M team, and so we were in the lobby and my (Laughs)     my mother  had a cowbell and she was ringing the cowbell. A lot of other people  were, too   and one of the men that was   I don   t think he was a  policeman, but security anyway, came up to her and says,    Lady, I   m  sorry. You   ll have to quit ringing the cowbell in here.    And she just  turned around and rang it in his face, and he just escorted her right out  on the street and, of course, whenever that happened, here was this old  woman sixty years old that was being escorted out. All the kids got  behind her and oh they jeered and cheered and got out on the street, and  we practically had a pep rally out there. (Laughter) The security guard  ducked down and got out of it.  He had taken on more than he bargained for, hadn   t he? (Laughter)  By now, they   ve torn down the Baker Hotel so     Oh, gosh. What a great memory.  But then my husband came home and we were married in November of  24  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty     45, which was the next school year really, and OSU played in the Sugar  Bowl, and so we went to that. I   d just had about four days off from Sears  when we got married and so that was our honeymoon really. We went  to     New Orleans for that?     to New Orleans for the Sugar Bowl, and we won that one, too. And  so     That was a great two years of football.  You know, yes, and     And basketball, too.  Yes, Bob Kurland. Can I tell you about the first time I saw Bob  Kurland?  Sure. (Laughter)  I was coming out of the Publication Building and I saw this man coming  across the street. He had on a high school letterman   s jacket. Nobody  ever wore a high school letterman   s jacket on campus. You know, by the  time you got to college, you   d discarded those. He had on this high  school letterman   s jacket, trousers   a little short, this shock of red hair  out of control, and I thought,    What has Iba done now?    (Laughter) By  the time school started and Kurland was playing basketball, I thought,     Boy, Iba sure knows how to take        He   s a genius. (Laughter)  Right, and Bob got into the campus life, got a little something on his hair  to keep it down, discarded his letterman   s jacket and he was a really nice  fella in school and still is, I think. I was really sad to see   I believe it  was when they put the dome on the capitol, that they had all of these  people that had been important to the State of Oklahoma and they had     Bob Fenimore and Bob Kurland both were there and they had to walk up  some steps to get to where this podium   and then down some to the  front, and these are old men now. (Laughter)  I know, they are.  They   re as old as I am or maybe they   re a year or two younger, but  they   re pushing   or had pushed eighty already by then, but I was really  disappointed to see that they   d turned old just like I had. (Laughter)  25  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  They should stay young forever, shouldn   t they?  Absolutely. Right.  Well, it seems like you have really maintained your ties with the  university over the years. Is there any particular reason that it continues  to be so important to you?  (Laughs) Well, it was an exciting time to be there. I had a good time. I  learned enough to     just accidentally learned enough to have a career  that I enjoyed, and I didn   t tell you about this gift shop that we speak of.  The gift shop   s just   or it   s not there anymore, but it was a block and a  half away from our house here in Tulsa, and one day I was up there  shopping and bought a Christmas candy dish and I said to the lady,    You  really don   t need to gift wrap that. It   s for me.    And so she left the box  that it came in   a corrugated box and she was trying to fold over the  pieces and finally I said,    Here let me do that.    So I folded it and she  said,    Well, you   re pretty able to do things like that. Would you ever be  interested in working in a gift shop?    And I said,    Oh, I might be.    And  so she called me in a couple of months, and I worked for her two or  three days a week for five years. Then she was gonna sell the shop and  our youngest child was gonna be a senior in high school and I thought,     I   ll be looking for a career someplace else.     Right.  So we just bought the gift shop, (Laughs) and we kept it for twenty-three  years and it was a joy to have. During the time that we had the gift shop,  the economy got bad. The oil boom was bust (Laughter) and we still did  really well with the gift shop.  Great.  My husband retired, and he never did really work in the gift shop.  And maybe he liked it that way, right? (Laughter)  And he   d done his thing, but he did some of the book work. He was an  accountant and so he did some of the book work for us, and in the gift  shop we had a post office   a contract station, and oh at the busy, busy  times, Christmas and when they changed the price of stamps. But one  year he took vacation from his job and helped us in the post office. So  after Christmas, one of the women that was in there often was talking to  me and she said to me,    I   ll tell you, Peggy, that man that the post office  sent out here to help you all wasn   t really much help, was he?     (Laughter)  26  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  So did you ever tell him?  I said,    Well, we didn   t have to pay him.    (Laughs)  So, your husband did complete his degree from OAMC?  Yes.  And it was an accounting degree?  Yes.  And what year did he graduate?  Oh, he graduated in 1946     Okay.     in July of 1946. He just had to go   when he came back from the  service, he had a semester and a summer, and he finished then.  And you mentioned that you had three children. Did any of them     Two.  Two children. Did any of them attend, or either of them?  Yes, where you probably picked up the three   David went three times  before he graduated. (Laughter)  Some people   it just takes them multiple times. (Laughs)  David had a high IQ, really high IQ, but he really didn   t want to learn  more about arithmetic and English. He was interested in electronics and  he finally did get through school, and     And did he do that at OSU or somewhere else?  Yes, but he passed away a couple of years ago. He   s an example of one  of these young men that just couldn   t quit smoking. He had lung cancer  and died and at the time he died     Oh, how tragic.     he was the manager of the Cox Communication in McAlester.  27  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Okay.  He lived in McAlester, and so this was just right down his alley,  something that he learned a lot about and enjoyed doing and had a good  career after he grew up. Susan, our daughter, went to OSU for two years  and, at the time, she was   I could have been like my mother walking  from one end of the house to the other. (Laughter) She was going to  major in therapeutic recreation, and so she couldn   t get a degree in that  at OSU and so she went to OU and finished, but she says,    I   m still a  Poke at heart.    (Laughs) And she works for St. John   s     Okay.      and has worked   she worked in Oklahoma City for about three years  and then she was up here for Christmas one year and her daddy was  reading an ad in the paper and says,    Why don   t you go apply for that  job?    And she did and got it, and it was with St. John   s, and so she   s  been with them for   since then. She   s forty-seven.  Wonderful. And now OSU has a program in therapeutic recreation, so  she was just before her time (Laughter) because I have two friends that  are faculty members in that area, so that   s interesting to hear.  Well, there was a lady named Scout. Are you familiar with somebody  over there named Scout?  Scout Cloud Lee, yes.     She was one of Susan   s teachers.  She was like one of the last people on Survivor  a television show that  aired on CBS     Season 9  for one season of it.  Yes. Susan was excited about that, that she was on that   but Susan lives  here in town about six blocks from me, and we see each other quite  often.  That   s great.  She never did marry, and David married when he was thirty-six, and so I  have no grandchildren.  Oh, I   m sorry.  But if you don   t have them, you don   t miss them.  28  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Well, that   s true, too.  And I hear other people talk about their grandchildren and think,    Gee,  how lucky I am.    (Laughter) And then other things, times I think,    Gee,  I wish I had some.    (Laughter)  Well, this is, I guess, maybe the perfect finishing question for you   if you  had grandchildren, or if you were giving advice to someone that would  be starting college today at OSU, what advice would you give to them?  Well, I think what Garth Brooks says on that ad on TV is really apropos  and it pretty well fills my idea of OSU. You can get an education there  and you can have a good time, and both are necessary. (Laughs) I  remember reading in one of the Oklahoma State magazines, they had  interviewed somebody from out in the western part of the state, I think,  and he said that when   I think he had three sons, and he said that these  boys would all be talking about they were going to Yale and they were  going to UCLA and they were going someplace else to college, and said  that whenever it really came down to it, he said,    Well, I think that   s  great. You go on, but if you want me to pay for it, you   re going to  OSU.    (Laughter) And I think they took his suggestion and went to  OSU.  Well, money talks. (Laughter)  Right.  So is there anything that you wish that I had asked you about that I  didn   t?  I was gonna tell you about the cowbell.  Oh, yes.  The cowbell     The one that   s right up on the shelf here?  Yes.  Let me adjust the camera so that we can see that.  When   I think it was my sophomore year, we   d been to a football game  and there was a boy on campus named Gene Weden. I think Gene was  from Stillwater, and anyhow we were just all walking along and talking  and I said,    You know, I don   t have a cowbell.    And he said,    Well,  29  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  Daugherty  Paustenbaugh  here Peggy. Take this one.    And he gave me his cowbell, and I still have  it        have it? (Laughter)  And I still remember who gave it to me. That   s the unusual part.  (Laughs)  Well, that   s great. Well, thank you so much for spending this time with  me today. It   s been a lot of fun.  Well, I enjoyed visiting with you, and I hope that the interview is  successful.  Thank you.  -------  -------
