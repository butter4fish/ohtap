MARTIN: 	This is Patti Klein, class of 1961, interviewed by Grace Martin.  So how did you choose Smith?

KLEIN:	First let me say my real name is Phyllis.  My nickname is Patti and my name at Smith was Levine.  So and then I married Harvey Klein and I became Klein and in the days I got married you took your husband’s name.  Most people did, most women did anyhow.  So your question was?

MARTIN:	How did you choose Smith?

KLEIN:	I chose Smith because I wanted to go to one of the women’s Ivy colleges and in those days, as you may know, women didn't go to Harvard, Princeton, Yale, University of Pennsylvania, any of those.  I don’t think Penn.  But there were the women’s, the Seven Sister colleges.  And so I looked at, basically at all of them and I fell in love with Smith.  I remember the person who took us, you know, you came to Smith and I came with my mother, we stayed somewhere in town and I remember driving up Elm Street and I think it's Academy Music Theater is still there, it's a movie theater?  They were playing the Solid Gold Cadillac and I remember the night we came up we went to see that movie.  And I came for my interview and I was shown around by a young woman who was in Chapin House on the main campus which at that time had about half the number of buildings you have now.  And the women there were so warm and cordial it really made me feel comfortable, more comfortable than I’d felt when I went to Wellesley or to Radcliffe or some of the others and it just felt good.  I felt I would be welcome here and it would not be so hard for me to make friends.  And then we walked around the campus, which is absolutely beautiful, and it just seemed like such a warm and welcoming place that I hoped I would get in, which I did.  And that's how I got to Smith.

MARTIN:	So what was the campus atmosphere like when you were here?

KLEIN:	That's a very big question.  I came from a small town in New Jersey where, and a family where my father was a research scientist.  My mother had been a lawyer but wasn't working as one, hadn't worked as one for many years.  And I was not from a political background.  My family was really not political.  My mother was a little active in the community, my father was involved in his academic life.  My father loved music and the arts and I learned a little bit about that but didn't know very much.  So I was not politically active.  But I did go to a somewhat large high school.  Had a high school class of about, I don’t know, four or 500 people.  It was not a very intellectual background and when I came to Smith what I was looking for was education in all academic subjects and particularly culture.  And so I didn't really get involved in political life.  Actually in 1957 when I started here it was the rare young woman who really was politically active.  It was very quiet.  This was before the women’s revolution of the 60s and it was a time when in most families and sort of culturally you were expected to go to college, get a good education, get married, have children and do some community work and that was sort of what was expected of you and women who went into professional life were considered unusual and usually had people in their background who supported doing that, and I didn't particularly, although because my mother had been a lawyer but had never practiced I thought I might want to go to law school but my mother was not particularly encouraging.
She had stopped practicing when my next oldest, the next oldest child in the family, I was the oldest of four and the other three were all boys, and when my oldest brother was born my mother stopped working and then was involved in my father’s life.  He traveled a lot in his research work and so I just sort of didn't think about professional life.  When I got to Smith I was like a kid in a candy store.  Every course seemed to me so wonderful I could hardly decide one from the other and I ended up, first I took Art 11 which I believe is still a legendary course and it was such an eye opener.  It was just fantastic and the museum here was wonderful, in the old building that it was in, and I just loved all these courses.  So I decided to major in history and then I minored in English and the history of art.  So you can imagine, I was really spread out over a lot of different subjects, but I loved all the courses.  I just couldn't take enough of all of them.  I think as a result, not coming from a political background, the times being what they were, and choosing to have the sort of diversity of course work, I didn't focus say on history.  I had a major in history.  So I probably didn't have the close relationship with faculty members that honors students did.  And then there might have been people who might have encouraged me in a more professional direction but I did have this bug about law school.
However, in my senior year a tragic thing happened.  I had three younger brothers and the middle brother, who was then 17, was killed in an automobile accident about a week before Rally Day in 1961 and everything in my life changed.  I went home for about two weeks or so and then my mother was really pretty wonderful, she just insisted that we all go back to our normal lives because we had to.  And so I came back to Smith but I was pretty shaken and so I applied to Harvard for the Master of Arts in Teaching program which is a very traditional thing to have done.  I had decided when I was at Smith I didn't want to take any education courses because I couldn't give up the art and the history and the literature.
So I went to Harvard and I spent a year taking the education courses and then you took some wonderful graduate history courses.  And I got my MAT degree.  I had to practice teaching and so forth.  And then I thought, You know, I don’t really want to teach, I want to work in the literary world.  So I went to New York and like all of the other Ivy League graduates I came to New York and we were sort of a dime a dozen.  The pay was negligible but so many women college graduates wanted to do these jobs and I was really lucky to have gotten a job at Doubleday and Company at a time when they were starting a new imprint, a paperback imprint, and it was the very beginning of publishing books in paperback as textbooks.  So I was assigned three academic subjects.  I was assigned professors around the country to talk to and work with and read books and recommend books for publication.  But I also worked with an editor who was working in what they called the trade or hardcover division and so I worked on and edited books and some of them were really distinguished, well known people.  It was just the most exciting thing to be doing and I really loved the work, and then I met my husband who was a medical student, was at Harvard at the time and then came to New York and did his internship in New York.
And we got married in 1963.  I continued working in this division, Anchor Books, of Doubleday, and then in 1964 my husband was a resident at the Cornell Medical School and that was the beginning of the war in Vietnam and all doctors were drafted into a plan called the [Berry] Plan.  And he knew that he was going to be drafted and he said, “Look, I could go anywhere over the country, maybe even over the world, and you're working in publishing, I don’t know how you're going to get a job.”  And he said, “I think you should take a teaching job.”  And I thought, Oh, that's not really what I want to do, but you know, from a practical point of view I was earning more money than he was and in fact, we rented the furniture in our apartment.  We really had not much money at all.  And so very reluctantly I went and got myself a teaching job for September of 1965 I guess it was.  And over the summer the woman I worked for said, “Oh, you can't quit and teach.”  And I said, “I don’t want to but I don’t know what I'm going to do about this.”  She said, “I know what we're going to do.”  She said, “I have a house out on Long Island in Sag Harbor.”  And she was married to man who was an editor at Fortune Magazine and they knew all of the literary people in New York at that time, the real intelligentsia, so she invited us out for the weekend and we met all sorts of really interesting people and by the end of the weekend my husband said, “You can't quit that job.”  I said hooray.
And so I didn't take the teaching job, I stayed at Anchor Books for another year.  It was the best job possibly I've ever had and that was terrific.  But then I did have to leave in 1965 when we went into the Air Force.  My husband became a captain in the Air Force in Mina, North Dakota, where we lived for two years and I taught college out there.  I had the MAT degree which qualified as a Masters for their requirements for teaching in the local college.  I did that for almost two years and then had my first child, came back to New York.  You couldn't get part time, decent part time jobs in those days, which is what I would have liked to do, but I came back with a baby, she was six months old at the time, and my husband worked every other night, every other weekend, for years.  And so he basically wasn't able to take care of the family and I did, so I did a lot of volunteer work.  And I think Smith contributed to that.
So I've gotten way off of the atmosphere at Smith but what I was doing really related to how I related to the atmosphere at Smith.  I was not involved in politics.  I know I had a few friends who were downtown rallying out on the streets and one thing or another and that just completely passed me by.  I was just busy basically educating myself.  On the other hand, it was a very warm and welcoming place.  I had gone to a public high school.  A lot of the women who came to Smith had come from private schools where they knew each other.  They had a lot of friends.  I really didn't know anybody when I came to Smith.  And my first year at Smith I had to learn a lot of things that the young women who had gone to private schools had learned.  They had learned how to write, how to do research papers, and all those things.  I didn't have that learning.  So the first year at Smith was pretty tough for me, but of course after that I learned what I needed to learn and it was terrific.
I lived in a house I'm not sure still exists.  It was called Hopkins A, otherwise known as Little Hop, and it was a small house with ten women in it next to what was called Hopkins B.  I don’t know, is it Hopkins House now?  Whatever it is, up on Elm Street.  And there were just ten of us so of course we were a very small group but we ate our meals in Hopkins B.  But somehow it's good they don’t have that any more because you were really segregated as a small group of ten and it was hard to integrate into the rest of the house because when you went for dinner you sat with the people you knew which was basically the people in your house.  And during that first year I met a number of women who were living in Morris House down on Green Street and they invited me to come to Morris House.  So starting my sophomore year I lived in Morris House on Green Street and I loved it there.  We had a terrific time and I became a semi fanatical bridge player and every night after every dinner you always played bridge for a half hour or 45 minutes and that was only when you were really studying for exams did that break up.  Everybody played bridge and I was one of the regulars and I really loved bridge.  I haven't played it in years because my husband isn't a game player and so I've given it up and now it's sort of a whole new game, but when I think of Smith I think of bridge.
The other thing I think of is knitting.  I don’t know if that's still a tradition at Smith.  Yes, you're saying yes.  But I knitted a little bit before I came to Smith but everybody was a knitter and I don’t know how the professors tolerated looking at a classroom full of women all sitting there knitting but I learned how to knit and take notes.  I still can knit with a pen in my hand.  I can knit under just about any circumstances.  I knit in cars, I knit everywhere.  And I loved knitting but after Smith I was busy doing other things and until I had grandchildren I didn't take up knitting again.  And almost ten years ago we were very fortunate to have our first of now four grandchildren and I have been knitting again ever since.  And I found out about a knitting class, a group of women at Smith, not through the Smith Club but a different group, who knit and we have women in that group who range in age from their 30s up until their 80s and it is terrific.  So once a month we get together and talk to each other and that Smith connection opens up relationships.  And so the Smith knitting group has become a very good part of my life.  So I know they sound like trivial things, knitting and so forth, but they were kind of what the fabric of my life here at Smith.
And my freshman year I do remember first of all the fire drills.  Have you heard about the fire drills?

MARTIN:	No.

KLEIN:	The year before we came to Smith there was a terrible fire in one of the houses.  I think it was on Green Street and the house burned down in, I don’t know, it was something like five minutes, six minutes, whatever it was, so when we came, I came, to Smith the very first thing you were required to do was a fire test which meant climbing down a fire rope that was as high as the tallest of the houses that then existed at Smith.  And we went into the gym and we had to climb down, go down this fire rope.  That was a requirement but obviously it was sensible but let me tell you, it was scary and you really tore up your hands doing it, but you had to do it.  And the other thing at Smith were the notorious posture pictures which I won’t even talk about but in retrospect it's amazing that we didn't protest more about those pictures.  But then we had a gym requirement, and I was not very physically active.  I'm infinitely more physically active now than I was as a young college student, because it wasn't the thing to do.  Now young women exercise as just part of life but it wasn't, it seemed like you were coddling yourself by doing exercise and whatnot.  So I ended up as the crew member, I was at crew and I was the coxswain on the crew team which is the most outrageous thing to think about in connection with me.  (laughter)  But I really loved that because it was so beautiful out on Paradise Pond.  And I never really got anywhere.  I was never really a rower but it was sort of a fun thing to do.  So that's a very long answer to a very short question.

GEIS:	I'm just going to change our battery, one sec.  (overlapping dialogue; inaudible)  Hold that thought.

KLEIN:	I'll continue with that.  So you wanted to know about the person I've become since I left Smith.  Well, of course I had that horrible family situation hanging over my head when I left Smith.  So I really think it probably took a year or so for me to feel that I could make decisions about my future without thinking about all these things that had happened.  I think my mother handled the situation very well as far as the children in the family, my two brothers and myself, in getting us back into life but it really took a toll on my parents’ marriage.  And that was very stressful for everyone involved.  So I just went on with my life and, as I pointed out before, I went to graduate school at Harvard, then I went to New York to work, then we went into the Air Force, but in the back of my mind all the time was this idea of law school.  However, I then had a second child in 1970.  My husband continued in his training and continued to work enormously long hours.
He got the occupational disease of hepatitis when he was in training and he was really sick for about, he was in the hospital for about seven weeks and that occurred when I had a three week old baby.  So he was gone for seven weeks.  Then we didn't know about his future.  We didn't know whether he was going to recover and how and he really was sick.  We were going to move somewhere, he was going to go into practice as a gastroenterologist and then he was worried about having chronic liver disease, which is a hazard of hepatitis.  So we ended up staying in New York and we have been there ever since and he is now a professor on the faculty at Cornell Medical College.  He never left.  But meanwhile I had these children growing up, of all things, in New York City which I never thought I would manage to do.  But when you have children growing up in New York City it's a very parent intensive parenting because you really have to be much more involved and engaged in taking your children places and so forth and they really can't do much on their own when they're quite young.  So I was very involved in my children’s lives but I kept thinking about going to law school but the time wasn't right.
So I ended up going to graduate school, starting a Masters in history and I went to Hunter College which is in my neighborhood and I began taking one course at a time.  And then the city of New York went into a financial crisis and they could not afford to hire teachers to teach their basic history course in their evening school at Hunter.  Well, I had had that teaching experience when I was in the Air Force and I had the masters degree from Harvard and so I had qualifications to do that and as part of the course work I was doing at Hunter they had me teaching an evening American history course that I got credit for as part of my masters degree so they didn't have to pay anyone and I got credit for the course.  So it worked out perfectly.
So I taught for awhile and then I heard about a graduate archives program down at NYU that combined an MA in American history with a certificate in archival management and historical editing and I entered that program.  And before I’d been there a semester I was hired to become the assistant director of the archives program which at that time was being funded by a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities.  And the grant got renewed with room for an assistant director.  So while I was continuing my MA in history and archival administration I was teaching in the course and so I taught the practical course and I was responsible for the internships and putting the curriculum together and doing all sorts of other things while continuing taking my own.  First I finished the archive school training program and then I took the courses towards my Masters degree.
And then came the definitive moment when I finished all my courses which I got tuition free because I was a faculty member.  I got tuition free at NYU so I just kept taking courses, which I love to do, and then I had to make a decision whether to take the language courses and all the oral and written exams, written and oral exams for a Ph.D. in history or go to law school.  And I decided what I wanted to do was eventually go to law school so I developed my own archives business after I had finished the MA.  I did my MA in women and the law in the 1920s and I used the archives at NYU out of which I was teaching students and they had some wonderful archival records of suffragettes and other people and also NYU has a marvelous law school.  A law school that actually admitted, it was among the first to admit women to law and they had a substantial number of women law graduates and so my focus was women in the 20s and I did oral interviews of women who had gone to law school in the 20s and that has a story that relates to Smith.
Because as a result of that combined, my doing the archives, being in the archives program, there was an oral history component that I didn't teach but that I worked with people who were teaching it and when I left NYU I had my own archives business for about ten years.  I was an archival consultant and I was doing oral histories for Columbia University which has a major oral history program and I interviewed a woman who had been at NYU Law School in the 1920s and as I got to know her I realized she had been one of the first women judges in New York.  Her name was Hilda Schwartz.  And I persuaded her to leave her papers to the Sophia Smith Collection.  So I felt really good about bringing all these connections in my life together and those papers, I believe, are still here.
Anyhow I had my archives business and then my youngest child went off to college and I said OK, this is it, now or never, you've been talking about law school for 25 years, now’s the time.  So I went and I kept my archives business and I took the Kaplan course, studied for the LSATs, took the LSATs.  Almost killed myself taking the LSATs, which was nothing compared to what came in the future.  Got into Fordham Law School, stayed in the law school, kept my archives business the first year on hold but it all worked out and eventually I graduated from Fordham Law School.  I was very fortunate to get a federal clerkship for two years.  I then worked for a law firm in the city of New York.  I did health care law working on the side of providers and hospitals.  Worked in hospitals, as a hospital lawyer for awhile and then it just became too big a strain on our life for me to be working those sorts of hours and so I retired.  And at that point I decided I didn't want to give up the law and I wanted to do something that I really think came out of my Smith tradition which is learning that giving back to the community was an important thing for women to do.
And so I went to work for an organization called Legal Services for Children, which is now called Partnership for Children’s Rights, and for the last almost ten years I've represented very low income disabled students who need placements and services as special education students.  Our opponent is the New York City Department of Education and we represent, if these families meet our income qualifications, which to give you an idea is $53,000 is the most a family can earn and it's a sliding scale depending on the number of people in the family.  So even in New York City if you have a family of four or five children, which people do, and they can't earn more than $53,000 to be our clients and we represent them for free.  So that's what I do now.  I'm now on that board and I'm on the board of an environmental organization.  We have a home in the Berkshires which we've had for 36 years and I'm on a board there.  So now I'm retired but I'm still working as a lawyer.  I have a lot of obligations that I try to fit in time with my grandchildren in the midst of all of this, which I think is important because they're little and when they get bigger they're not going to have time for their grandma and their grandpa.  So we try to find time for that.  So I've never been busier and I attribute a lot of this, I guess I have a lot of energy but I attribute a lot of this to the approach to life that I learned at Smith.

MARTIN:	Wow.  (Laughter)

KLEIN:	 Is that it?

MARTIN:	This is wonderful.  Thank you very much.
