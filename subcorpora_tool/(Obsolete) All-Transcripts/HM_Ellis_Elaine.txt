Speaker 2: How long did you live in Panama?
Speaker 1: Until I was seven years of age.
Speaker 2: Do you remember anything about it?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember quite a bit.  I remember carnivals.  We lived on the second floor of this building.  And the carnival would come through the street and we would run--they had what they would call the veranda, and we were all so excited.  It was exciting to watch all the performers.  I remember that clearly.
Speaker 2: And do you remember anything else about living in Panama?
Speaker 1: My father moved to Costa Rica.  He played the violin, as I said before.  And he used to play with a group of men, and I remember dancing.  And they said I was going to be a shake dancer, because I was shaking that thing, you know (laughter).  I remember that.
Story_ID: 466428
Speaker 1: Do you know why your parents [Flossie Freeman McNeil and Clifford McNeil] decided to move to New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: For better living conditions.
Speaker 1: So, you moved to New York when you were seven?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the move?
Speaker 2: I remember that trip, yeah.  And when I got to New York, they stole all--all my bags were stolen with all my clothes in it.  My mother had to take me shopping right away as soon as we got off the boat.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: I remember that.
Speaker 1: And so you took a boat?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: I was going to ask how you traveled (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) By boat.
Speaker 1: And so you came around, all the way up to New York?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, right.
Speaker 1: How long did that take (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I don't remember that.
Speaker 1: You might not remember exactly.  But was it a long trip?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.
Speaker 1: So, when you came to New York, where did you live?
Speaker 2: I lived on St. Nicholas Avenue.
Speaker 1: And can you describe what your, what your building and your apartment was like?
Speaker 2: Yes, I even know the address.  It was 416 St. Nicholas Avenue.  I think Lionel Hampton took those buildings.  They put new buildings up, and they tore those buildings down.
Speaker 1: What was your cross street?
Speaker 2: I think 130th [Street].
Story_ID: 466429
Speaker 1: I started school at P.S. 57 [New York, New York], I remember that.  They started a bank account for me there.  I don't know what ever happened to it.
Speaker 2: At P.S. 57 (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I remember that clearly.
Speaker 2: But you had the bank account?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And do you remember going to P.S. 57?
Speaker 1: I certainly do.  I remember my aunt taking me and registering me.
Speaker 2: And did you like attending school there?
Speaker 1: Oh, I loved it.
Speaker 2: Do you remember any of the kinds of things that you did while you were in school?
Speaker 1: No.  Opening up a bank account was so exciting to me.  I thought I was going to end up rich.
Speaker 2: With lots of money.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And did you have--what were the other people in your school like?  Was everyone there black also?  Or was it a--
Speaker 1: Yes, they were.
Speaker 2: And were--
Speaker 1: Spanish were mixed in, you know.
Speaker 2: And were any of them from the islands?
Speaker 1: I think most of them were.
Speaker 2: Most of them, like you, had moved to New York [New York]?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, they migrated here.
Story_ID: 466430
Speaker 1: When you were a small child, did you have a sense that you wanted to be a dancer?  Or did you have any career plans (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I used to love getting on the corner with the other kids that were going to dance classes and trying to keep up with them.  And the first step I learned was the time step, which is the basic step that you need to know if you're ever going to dance.
Speaker 1: The time step?
Speaker 2: That was the first thing I learned.
Speaker 1: So, did you take any formal dance classes?
Speaker 2: No, I never did.
Speaker 1: So all of your dance learning was outside, by students of dance who showed you how to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And watching other people.
Speaker 1: --do it.  So, first you learned the time step.  And do you remember any of the other steps that you learned?
Speaker 2: No.  From that step, it led to any other step that I had to do.  When I went to the audition at the Cotton Club [New York, New York] that was the first thing they asked me, did I know how to do the time step?  I proudly told them yes.  I didn't tell them that was the only step I knew.
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: Okay--
Speaker 1: Okay, did you want to say something else?
Speaker 2: I was going to tell you about my experience starting in the Cotton Club.
Story_ID: 466431
Speaker 1: Let me ask you a few more questions about when you were young, and then we'll get to that next.  Where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: Jamaica High [Jamaica High School, Queens, New York].
Speaker 1: Jamaica High?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And that's on Long Island [New York]?
Speaker 2: Yes, it's in Jamaica [Queens, New York].
Speaker 1: So you're telling me that your family moved around a lot.
Speaker 2: Oh, they did.
Speaker 1: Do you--besides Jamaica--
Speaker 2: Corona [Queens, New York].
Speaker 1: Yes, Corona.  And anyplace else?
Speaker 2: The Bronx [New York].
Speaker 1: Wow.  And just earlier we were talking about you learning to dance.  And you had said that Henry LeTang was the dance teacher?
Speaker 2: No, the children, some of the children that I learned from went to them.  I never went to him.  I used to get the steps from the students, his students.
Speaker 1: I understand.  But I thought you said that Henry LeTang was, you know, quite a big dance teacher (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He's well-known, yeah.  At the time, yes, he was.
Speaker 1: So, you were getting premier instruction.
Speaker 2: Free (laughter).
Speaker 1: And when did you start dancing?  Did you do any public dancing when you were a kid (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not really.
Speaker 1: Like, before you started dancing, did you do any dancing?
Speaker 2: Not really.
Story_ID: 466432
Speaker 1: So when you graduated from high school [Jamaica High School, Queens, New York], did you get a job?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.  I don't think so right away.  But I got a job with the--oh, I'll wait.
Speaker 1: With the where?
Speaker 2: With the touch typing school.
Speaker 1: Yes.  And so can you describe that for me?  I know you told me about it earlier.
Speaker 2: They had a, they worked from the building on 57th Street.  And they had new machinery where they could teach touch typing, and that's where I worked as an instructor.  And then I later worked for them, traveling, to teach other people how to use the machines.
Speaker 1: And did you travel to schools, or did you travel to businesses?
Speaker 2: Businesses.
Speaker 1: And you said that the touch typing was a new form of typing.  What kind of typing--
Speaker 2: Well, see--
Speaker 1: --were people doing before that?
Speaker 2: They were looking at the keys and--they, they were like peck and find.  But this way you never looked at the keys, you knew them automatically.  You learned where they were positioned.
Speaker 1: And about how long did you travel and teach at the typing school?
Speaker 2: I worked quite a while with them.
Speaker 1: And what did you decide to do after you finished working with them?
Speaker 2: I didn't know what I wanted to do.  I think that's when I decided to open up the cleaning establishment, and I tried it.
Speaker 1: And this is was a dry cleaners?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was.
Speaker 1: And do you have any idea how you came to that?  Did you know someone else who was a dry cleaner?
Speaker 2: No.  I tried several things.  I tried going into the beauty culture field.  And I rented a booth and knocked myself out, trying to make a dollar.  The people with long hair wanted short hair, and the people with short hair wanted long hair.  And I gave up after a while.
Speaker 1: And so then you tried the dry cleaners?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any other industry that you tried?
Speaker 2: You know, I could always sell anything I tried to, so I tried salesmanship for a while.
Speaker 1: What kind of things did you sell?
Speaker 2: In the cosmetic department--a friend of mine opened--I bought into--on 125th Street, Kenwood Reiter Store [ph.].  And I went in with this person as a partnership, and I sold cosmetics.
Speaker 1: And is Kenwood Reiter, is that a cosmetic brand (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was the name of the company where we had the cosmetic department.  It was, it was a drugstore.  It was a department store, and we just rented the first floor and made us a part for cosmetics and drug items.
Speaker 1: And how did that work?
Speaker 2: It didn't work so well (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Not so good?
Speaker 2: They stole us out of it.  And I used to tell my partner, don't be so trusting.  You can't leave cosmetics and things that people can use every day out, without locking it up where you are.  And he didn't believe me until we went out of business.
Story_ID: 466433
Speaker 1: When did you decide to start auditioning for dance performances (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, when I saw the ad for Spanish girls in the newspapers, in one of the newspapers.  I don't know if it was the Amsterdam [New York Amsterdam News] or which one.  But there was an ad for colored, for Spanish girls.
Speaker 1: Now, when you were working these other businesses, were you still dancing?
Speaker 2: Whenever I went out, I would show off a little bit.
Speaker 1: What kind of places did you go to?
Speaker 2: Different nightclubs.
Speaker 1: I thought maybe you might mention some of them, maybe some of them that don't exist anymore.
Speaker 2: Any ones, I bet you it wouldn't be existing now.
Speaker 1: Excellent.
Speaker 2: I think one was--I wish I had known you were going to ask me this.  I know somebody that would have been able to tell me that.
Speaker 1: Who knows all the clubs?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, you know, I'm not going to press you if you don't remember exactly the name.  I just wondered if you could think of any.
Speaker 2: I worked at the Lenox Lounge [New York, New York] for a while.  And there was another place I worked on 7th Avenue [Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard].  I can't remember the name of it, where you went down the steps.  I worked there for quite a while dancing.  I remember the man that owned it.  His name was Boodlum [ph.].
Speaker 1: Boodlum?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, tell us about answering the advertisement for the Spanish chorus girls.  Where was that audition held (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was downtown at the Cotton Club [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I went down there, and it was a lineup of Spanish, beautiful Spanish women.  But they couldn't swing, not then anyhow.  The Cotton Club girls were all present.  They were all present, and they put us in a line.  And the first thing they asked for was the time step, which I knew.  And I worked it.  And then one of the girls--I saw one of the girls in the line that belonged--that worked there, motioned for me to come in the back, and I did.  And they said, "Do you want to work here?"  And I said, "Yeah."  And they said, "We'll teach you the routines."  And they did.  I remember all the girls that taught me, too.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of their names?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.
Speaker 1: Will you tell us a couple?
Speaker 2: There were two sisters, oh, I remembered them up until now.
Speaker 1: Up until I just asked you.
Speaker 2: McCormack.  Dolly McCormack and Pearl McCormack.
Speaker 1: And did they teach you--
Speaker 2: And Dot Dash [Dorothy Dash], she was married to Ed Smalls who owned Small's Paradise [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: She's the one that took me and really taught me the routines.
Speaker 1: And did they teach you the routines there at the Cotton Club?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How did that work?
Speaker 2: It worked fine.
Speaker 1: How much time did you spend learning?
Speaker 2: Every afternoon I'd go and work out with them; they took a lot of time with me.  They were very kind to me.
Speaker 1: And how long after you started training with them did you start performing with them?
Speaker 2: Not too long afterwards, because I was hired.
Speaker 1: That same day?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I remember the first time I danced I was in the lineup.  All the old Cotton Club girls, they knew I was just starting with them.  And they'd holler, "Smile, smile."  And I won't even tell you what else they would call me.  And they said, "You got to smile.  And turn."  They were telling me the steps while I was performing.  And while we were performing, all the showgirls--you know, they had ponies and they had showgirls.  The showgirls were the tall statuesque beautiful women.  They would be parading while we were dancing.  The ones who danced were called ponies.  And that's what I was, because I'm short.  But all the girls were so beautiful--tall and statuesque.  They would pose, walk, and perform.  That's all they did, they didn't dance at all.  I'll never forget that.
Speaker 1: And when you were performing at the Cotton Club, what street was it on?
Speaker 2: It was downtown, I think on 40-something Street [48th Street] and Broadway.
Speaker 1: Because now we're at the Cotton Club, but we're on 12th Avenue I think and 125th Street--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --just to make the distinction.
Speaker 2: Right, it was a big difference.
Speaker 1: And what kind of bands--do you remember any of the bands?
Speaker 2: Andy Kirk for one, and Don Redman.  Cab [Cab Calloway] didn't work--I never worked with Cab there.  But I remember Andy Kirk and Don Redman.
Speaker 1: What was your schedule like?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I, I had a son [William Monroe (ph.)], so I couldn't, I didn't hang out.  I used to just go to work, and after work I'd take a cab home because I knew he'd be up waiting for me.
Story_ID: 466434
Speaker 1: How old was your son [William Monroe (ph.)] at that point?
Speaker 2: He was, well, he's sixty-eight now.  So he had to be about five or six.  But he wouldn't go to sleep until I came in, and he'd be standing on the crib and jumping up and down on the crib waiting for me to come in.  And I used to have to break my neck to get home.  And it cost me quite a bit, taking the cab home.
Speaker 1: You were still living on St. Nicholas [Avenue] at 130th [Street]?
Speaker 2: No.  At the time I was living in the Bronx [New York].
Speaker 1: Wow.  How much was a cab at that time?
Speaker 2: Oh, about twelve or fifteen dollars.  But out of my small salary (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That is--
Speaker 2: --that was a lot.
Speaker 1: It's a lot.  It's still, it's twenty or twenty-five dollars now.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know.
Speaker 1: That's quite a bit of money.
Speaker 2: A big difference, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, I had not realized from our discussion beforehand that you--you told me that you met your husband at a dance party.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I thought that that happened after--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So, can you--
Speaker 2: I met him before--not at a dance party, in a bar.  He was a bartender, which I later became after I stopped dancing.
Speaker 1: And whose bar--you met him before you started dancing?
Speaker 2: No, I met him after.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: I quit dancing because of him (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, I see.
Speaker 2: Because he was in the [U.S.] Army, and he would come home on leave and I'd be busy dancing.  I wouldn't be able to be with him.  So, he made me quit so I could be free when he came home.
Speaker 1: I see.
Story_ID: 466435
Speaker 1: Okay, so let's talk a little bit more about your schedule.  You said that you had to leave immediately to go home to your son [William Monroe (ph.)] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: But how many shows would you dance?
Speaker 2: A couple a night.
Speaker 1: And what time would you get there, and what time would you leave?
Speaker 2: Between twelve and one o'clock in the morning.
Speaker 1: And what time did you get there?
Speaker 2: I got there about six or seven.
Speaker 1: So, two or three shows?
Speaker 2: I don't remember exactly what time.
Speaker 1: But two or three shows a night?
Speaker 2: Two shows a night at the Cotton Club [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: And how long did you work there?  I thought also that you said that you did some dancing in Atlantic City [New Jersey].
Speaker 2: I did.  I worked at Paradise [Paradise Club, Atlantic City, New Jersey] and at Club Harlem [Atlantic City, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: How did you come to travel to Atlantic City to dance?
Speaker 2: The person that was in charge of the Club Harlem saw the show at the Apollo [Apollo Theater, New York, New York], and they wanted the whole show there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, then you went to the Apollo?
Speaker 2: I may be putting the cart before the horse.
Speaker 1: That's quite all right.  I'm just going to try to follow you, just so we can learn about some of the places that you worked.  So, when you went to--
Speaker 2: When I worked at the Paradise Club and the Club Harlem in Atlantic City, they hired us to work the Apollo Theater.  That's when they kept me.  The whole lineup went; the whole show went.
Speaker 1: And were you pleased about that move from Atlantic City (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, I enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: --to the Apollo?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was closer to home.
Speaker 1: And when you were working in Atlantic City, were you able to come home every day or (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, no.
Speaker 1: You were staying out there for periods of time?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 466436
Speaker 1: When you started to work at the Apollo [Apollo Theater, New York, New York], what kind of bands did you dance with while you were there?
Speaker 2: All the good bands that came in.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of their names?
Speaker 2: I know Don Redman's band [Don Redman and his Orchestra] was there for a while.  Lunceford [Jimmie Lunceford], I worked with him for a little while.
Speaker 1: What about Duke Ellington or--
Speaker 2: Count Basie, not Duke.  I didn't work with Duke there.
Speaker 1: Count Basie at the Apollo?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And how long did you work at the Apollo?
Speaker 2: For about a year, a little over a year.
Speaker 1: Did you join a union?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Was it the American Guild of Variety Artists?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  AGVA, right.
Speaker 1: And did that benefit you?  Was that helpful when you joined the union?
Speaker 2: It made me assured of a job for a certain length of time.
Speaker 1: How long would the union association--
Speaker 2: It was just started.  After the strike that they had, they started.
Speaker 1: After the strike at the Apollo?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And were you there to experience the strike at the Apollo?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't.  I wasn't one of the ones on strike.
Speaker 1: So you started after or?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then there was the union?
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 466437
Speaker 1: So, you said you were at the Apollo [Apollo Theater, New York, New York] for about a year?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And then you met your husband?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Or you decided that you would stop dancing so that you could spend time with him?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: And you said he was a bartender?
Speaker 2: Right, he worked at Count Basie's.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: He worked at several bars.
Speaker 1: Where was Count Basie's located?  On 132nd [Street]?
Speaker 2: On 132nd and 7th Avenue [Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard] in Manhattan [New York].
Speaker 1: And you said that he worked with Dicky Wells?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Who's Dicky Wells?
Speaker 2: He was, he owned an after-hour spot, you know.  They would open up when the bars closed.  And he worked, he used to work there also.
Speaker 1: So he was doing both.
Speaker 2: And he worked, he also worked with Billy Daniels.  They had an after-hour spot together.  So, he was just a bartender.
Speaker 1: Did you learn to be a bartender from your husband?
Speaker 2: No.  While he was in the [U.S.] Army and I was dancing, they talked me into--one of his friends owned a bar called the Renny Bar [ph.] on 7th Avenue and 138th Street.  And he persuaded me to quit dancing and to work in the bar so that I could make more money, which I did.  So I did, and I started working in a bar called the Renny Bar.  I was the first female to work there.
Speaker 1: Do you remember where that was located?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Renny Bar was on 138th Street and 7th Avenue.
Speaker 1: And did you enjoy bartending?
Speaker 2: Oh, I did, because I made a lot of money, a lot of tips.  I was personable, and I got to know everybody, what they drank and how they liked it served.
Speaker 1: And then you said you had quite a style when you were a bartender?
Speaker 2: I did, I did.  Wherever I would work, they would follow me.  So, I was an asset to whoever owned a bar at that time.
Speaker 1: And you said you were fast?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I was really fast behind the bar.
Speaker 1: What was your favorite drink to make?  What was your favorite cocktail or martini?
Speaker 2: I don't remember offhand.  A martini, a Manhattan or a martini.  You know, at that time people didn't, they didn't ask for a lot of mixed drinks.  They wanted the whiskey and the chaser.  And if you got so that you would remember what each person liked, you became, that's how you became--you gained your popularity by remembering people's choices and how they liked it served.  And when they would walk in, you'd be so glad to see them.  They would feel very important, and you'd be their favorite barmaid for a while.  But there were so many barmaids around.
Story_ID: 466438
Speaker 1: You were telling us just now about being a bartender and having a following.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about some of the awards that you won?
Speaker 2: They gave away a trip, and I won that when I worked in Queens [New York].  I worked in bars all over.  I worked on 145th Street in Manhattan [New York] at a bar called the Club Harlem.  I worked all over.  I worked in Queens, and they had this contest.  The contest was you selling--whoever sold the most chances that's how they won, they were the most popular.  You'd win a trip; they had different prizes.  But I got the plaque for the most efficient and the most pleasant.  When I used to think about the big tips I was going to get, I'd smile for anybody then (laughter).  So, it was easy.  And I did that for twenty-five years.
Speaker 1: Bartending?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Story_ID: 466439
Speaker 1: When Geri [HistoryMaker Geraldine Rhodes Kennedy] started the group [Silver Belles], you know I wanted to be in it.  Because they--she had all the great dancers, people that I really always used to look up to as far as their ability.  So I was so proud to be invited.  And I danced as much for her, with her group, than I did before, because we made all the big spots.
Speaker 2: Which ones?
Speaker 1: We worked Atlantic City [New Jersey] on the boardwalk with the Sister Sledge, and we were the only black female group ever to work on that boardwalk at that time.  So we got a lot of, we were well-known; we became well-known.  And we did a lot of benefits.  When I say benefits, we used to work at a lot of senior citizen centers to try to keep the people, the elderly people, interested in doing something.  Geri said that people were just sitting around waiting to die, and if they saw that we had so much fun dancing and doing things, they might wake up and do something to keep themselves, you know, motivated.  That's how we got started.
Speaker 2: And do you think that that happened?
Speaker 1: Oh, it certainly did.  It certainly did.  I didn't know that I would become one of the ones waiting to die.  At the time that we joined, none of us even thought about it.  We were having so much fun just being with each other.  But I think we did a lot of good, because a lot of people said, "If they're that old and they're up there dancing, we can do it too, you know."  And I heard a couple of groups got started after seeing us.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Perhaps at one of the senior centers?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's excellent.  So you would agree with Geri that dancing prolongs a person's life?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Activity of any kind, but I just am focused on dancing.
Speaker 1: Well, it was fun because dancing is fun.  If you like it, it's fun, and you show it.  And if you show them all the energy that you have, then they'll want to do something, too.  At least they'll give up sitting around waiting, thinking they can't do anything.
Speaker 2: Why do you think that people reach a certain age and think that they can't do anything?
Speaker 1: Because there's nothing out there for elderly people to do.  There's nothing.  Now they're opening up a lot of rehab places, but at one time there was no place for them to go.  You can't, you can't hang out.  There's no--where are you going to go?  You need money for anything that you do.  And after they retire, they don't have that kind of money.  So, consequently, they just sit around and wait 'til they're taken.  That's about all--
Story_ID: 466440
Speaker 1: So you said you went to a number of benefits and that you danced in different places.  Did you do (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We [Silver Belles] used to dance at different senior citizen centers free, you know.  We wouldn't charge, we wouldn't charge them anything.  And we did a lot of entertaining.  We went to a lot of places; we worked a lot of places.
Speaker 1: Outside of New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: A lot of them in the Bronx [New York], and at one time in Queens [New York].
Speaker 1: Did you travel down south?
Speaker 2: No, we never went south.
Speaker 1: So just in the general area?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So let's talk a little bit more about when you started dancing at the Cotton Club [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Oh, that was fun.
Speaker 1: Can you describe what the atmosphere was like, and what the people were like?
Speaker 2: Well, it was busy, busy, busy, you know, running up and down the steps to change your costumes and getting back when the band was ready to hit.  And the different celebrities that you worked with, it was exciting.  And afterwards they would hang out, you know, go to different clubs and see other entertainers at the Lenox Lounge [New York, New York] or wherever, wherever there was entertainment.  They would go in a group, you know.  It was just a lot of fun.  There was always something to do.
Speaker 1: And did you do that once your son [William Monroe (ph.)] got older?  Did you do some of the hanging out?
Speaker 2: Well, his dad raised him.  I did used to hang out.  In fact, tending bar you have to get around so that you become known and people want to come to see you.  That's how you build up your clientele, you know, with people wanting to come to where you work because you've been to where they hang out or whatever.  More or less, they're still your customers.  But it worked out okay.
Speaker 1: How did you let people at one place know that you had moved to another?
Speaker 2: Word of mouth.  They would follow you if they liked you.
Speaker 1: And at that time, did people get dressed up to go out (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Was it a much more formal time?
Speaker 2: Well, well, they would mostly hang out.  They were working class people, so they would work all week.  So they would hang out on weekends, and they would naturally get dressed up.  They didn't wear jeans and stuff like that.  They would really dress up.  Times were just so different.
Speaker 1: Tell me--
Speaker 2: I think we're getting back to that era when people are beginning to dress up more when they go out now, I think.
Speaker 1: So, tell me some more of the differences between now and then.
Speaker 2: Oh, then if you worked behind the bar you made some money.  If you gave them good service, they would throw big bills at you.  You made a lot, a good living tending bar.  Now I don't know what's happening, because the drinks are so expensive now they can't afford to be throwing you all that money.  But at one time you could make a good living, especially if they liked you, you know.  But I've enjoyed everything I've done, really.
Story_ID: 466441
Speaker 1: When I started dancing for Geri [HistoryMaker Geraldine Rhodes Kennedy], I used to quit every week.  And she said, "Oh no, you don't," and she wouldn't let me.  I'm so glad she didn't.
Speaker 2: Why would you quit?
Speaker 1: Because I would get tired of it, and I would think maybe I wasn't catching on to the steps the way I should.  She said, "You're doing as good as anybody, or better."  She said, "No, you're not going anywhere."  She wouldn't let me quit, and I'm so glad she didn't.
Speaker 2: And you would be at that next engagement?
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: So you had a good manager (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I did.
Speaker 2: --who was able to keep the group together.
Speaker 1: She not only kept it together, she got us good jobs.  I don't think any of the chorus girls got the recognition that we got.  But then I was in the group that--the dancers were really terrific, you know.
Speaker 2: The Silver Belles?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And eventually you all had a documentary ['Been Rich All My Life'] made about you.
Speaker 1: Yes, we did.
Speaker 2: Can you tell me a little bit about having that done?
Speaker 1: Well, we did a performance here [Cotton Club, New York, New York], I believe.  And somebody from The Times [The New York Times], somebody from The Times was here and they wrote up about us.  And this, this--but she's not a photographer, she's a movie maker.
Speaker 2: Heather Lyn MacDonald?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  She saw this write-up, and she came and asked Geri if she could come and watch us when we performed, and Geri asked us if we would mind.  Whatever Geri did, she always came to us and asked us what we thought.  And if we didn't want it, she wouldn't have done it.  But we agreed to let her come, and she came and she filmed everything we did.  She took pictures of us going down the subway, going up the subway, taking buses.  She used to follow us home.  She was with us for years.
Speaker 2: How many years?
Speaker 1: (Speaking off camera) How many years, Geri?  I don't remember.  Two years.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: But anywhere you went, there she was with the camera.  She used to carry the cameras on her back, as little as she is.
Speaker 2: And so did she go around to each of you and get an opportunity to see how you lived (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, she did, she did.  She used to come--
Speaker 2: And get an idea about what's going on?
Speaker 1: In fact one time she followed me home.  I lived in Queens [New York] at the time.  And I have a grandson that's a seven-footer.  And I lived in a co-op in Queens, and she came and she said, "Let's go take some pictures outside."  And so I said okay.  So my grandson was there and he went with me.  So when we got downstairs and started walking, you can't help but see him, he's so big.  All the children in the neighborhood started following us.  They thought that the photographers were there to take his picture, he was a basketball player.  They would take his picture.  So when they found it was little old me, then they flew (laughter).  It was funny, it was really funny.  They had no idea it was for me.  They thought if he was a basketball player, it was for him.  We've had a lot of fun.
Speaker 2: Good, good.  And the film is played internationally and is a fantastic piece of work.
Speaker 1: Yeah, everybody likes it.
Speaker 2: So, are you still dancing with the Silver Belles?  Or are you taking a break?
Speaker 1: Well, I've had two strokes.  So I had to take a little vacation.
Speaker 2: Take a break?
Speaker 1: But she's still talking to us and making contracts and involving us in everything.  I don't know if she'll ever let us quit.
Speaker 2: Do you intend to quit?
Speaker 1: Oh yes, I do.
Speaker 2: Okay, well, I guess that's a bad question, because you probably will not be quitting.
Speaker 1: Not if she's got anything to do with it.
Speaker 2: You don't look like you're going to be quitting anytime soon (laughter).
Speaker 1: I feel pretty good.  But if I--you know, a stroke does so much damage to you, and it takes quite a while to recoup.  I'm taking all kinds of therapy, and I'm hoping--if it's not doing a show every week, it'll be--I'll be in show business some kind of way I guess until they take me away.
Speaker 2: What other, do you have any other types of show business interests, something that you would like to do (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Not really.  Certainly not acting.  I told you, I'll be ninety in a couple of weeks.
Speaker 2: I don't see what that has to do with--
Speaker 1: I'm going to hang everything up (laughter).
Speaker 2: --being an actor (laughter).  Age is not going to keep you from acting.
Speaker 1: You don't think so?
Speaker 2: I absolutely--
Speaker 1: If she goes into that field, I guess that's what I'll be doing.
Speaker 2: I bet it is.  And I don't think that your being ninety will--
Speaker 1: Well, it cuts down on a lot.
Speaker 2: --interfere with that.
Speaker 1: But she keeps you all primed up.  She won't let you give up on anything.
Speaker 2: Do you want to share some pictures with us that you brought?
Speaker 1: I would like to, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, fantastic.

Speaker 1: The man in the center of the picture is my oldest brother.  And the lady with the white hair is my mother [Flossie Freeman McNeil].  And the two young girls on the side are her first grandchildren.

Speaker 1: This is a picture of a group of dancers that I, it's a group that I once belonged to called The Time Steppers.  And on it are some of the best dancers in the world, too many to name.  But the one on the end is a favorite of Geri's [HistoryMaker Geraldine Rhodes Kennedy].  That's Bertye Lou [Bertye Lou Wood], who belonged to our group [Silver Belles].  She died at one hundred.  That's her picture before she joined this group.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Do you remember their names?
Speaker 1: No, I don't remember their names, I think.  No, I take it back.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: The first lady's name is Peggy Harper.  And the second one is Bea Cheatham, she was married to a musician called Doc Cheatham.  And the lady in the back, I don't remember her name, and I don't remember the next lady.  I don't remember the next lady.  Now, keep on going.  This is Bernice Johnson, she was, she worked at--the one next to me.  This one is Bernice Johnson.  They called her Black Beauty.  She used to work the Apollo [Apollo Theater, New York, New York], and she would never work next to a person her color.  It had to be a light person, so that it would make her look better.  That's what she used to say.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: She'd always work next to the lightest person there.  Then the next person's name is Billie Covan.  Her husband used to own two bars in Manhattan [New York], the Renny Bar [ph.]--
Speaker 2: Where are you?
Speaker 1: I'm here.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): And that's your dress?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): And those are your shoes?
Speaker 1: Yes.  I couldn't borrow anybody's things.  All of us were different sizes.
Speaker 2: And did you all do your own makeup?
Speaker 1: Yes, always.
Speaker 2: And hair?
Speaker 1: This lady's name is Billie Covan.  Her husband owned two bars in Harlem [New York, New York], Covan's and the Renny Bar.  And this lady's name is Hutchinson, Renetta Hutchinson [ph.], and this is her sister, Lillian Hutchinson [ph.].  And this is Bertye Lou.  She is a favorite person in Harlem.  Everybody knows her, loves her.  She passed away when she was one hundred.
Speaker 2: Oh, this is a picture of a group of dancers at a club formerly called the Zanzibar [Cafe Zanzibar, New York, New York].  It's not open anymore, but it was a favorite, a big time club, almost as big as the Cotton Club [New York, New York].  And these are the dancers all in a row.  The first one's name is Jackie [ph.], I can't remember her last name.  And the next girl is a girl named Ferrie Purnell [ph.].  The next one is Rusty, Rusty Faulkner [ph.].  And the next girl, she moved to Baltimore [Maryland] and married a dentist there.  And the next is one of the Brown twins.  They were famous, they were known all over, they were identical twins.  And the next person is Hycie Curtis, she was married to a dance director, Clarence Robinson.  And the last one on that line is me, [HistoryMaker] Elaine Ellis.
Speaker 1: And who is playing the piano?
Speaker 2: Maurice Rocco, he was famous for playing the piano while standing up.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Here he is kneeling, I think.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was standing up.
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: Next is a picture of my son.  His name is William Monroe [ph.].  He is a photographer, and he's now having a one-man show in Seattle, Washington, which I hope will be successful.
Speaker 1: I gave you the write-up about her, her nationality?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay, so who is this?
Speaker 2: Tell us again.
Speaker 1: This is my father's [Clifford McNeil] mother.  Her name was Sophie [ph.].  She was born in England, and she bore eight children, four boys and four girls.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Next is a picture of the group I danced with before Miss Kennedy started the Silver Belles.  We were called The Time Steppers.  Do I have to tell you the names?  Because the names are right under it.
Speaker 2: Where are you?
Speaker 1: I'm on the right-hand side, the top picture on the left.  (Long pause) I think that picture was taken about 1940.  Louis Armstrong's wife is on there.
Speaker 2: What is her name?
Speaker 1: Her name is Lucille Armstrong [Lucille Wilson Armstrong].
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: And Dizzy Gillespie's wife is on there.  Her name is Lorraine Gillespie [Lorraine Willis Gillespie].  I don't know if that--I think that was before they were married.  And Bill Robinson's [Bill "Bojangles" Robinson] wife is on there.  Her name is Elaine Plaines [Elaine Plaines Robinson].  That's her.
Speaker 2: Elaine Robinson?
Speaker 1: Elaine Robinson, right.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my only daughter when she graduated from law school.  You see her receiving her diploma, or whatever you call it.  Her name is Gale Davis [ph.].
Speaker 1: And this is a picture of my oldest brother, I had five of them, and his grandson.  See the similarity in the way they look?  We didn't know that they looked so much alike until we saw this picture, the two pictures together (long pause).  That's Corliss' son.
