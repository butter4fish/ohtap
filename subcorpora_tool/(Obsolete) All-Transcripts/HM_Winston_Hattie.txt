Speaker 1: Okay.  And where are we today?  You don't need to give the address--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --But the general location.
Speaker 2: Okay.  We are in Los Angeles [California].  In the suburbs of Los Angeles.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In my home.
Speaker 1: Wonderful, wonderful.  And a beautiful home it is, by the way.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: And now, the hard--this is a hard question.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Today's date?
Speaker 2: That is a hard question (laughter) 'cause I have no idea.
Speaker 1: Most people don't.
Speaker 2: What is today's date?
Speaker 1: Today's date (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Is October the 7th of 2005.  Oh, my Lord, where am I?
Speaker 1: The majority of people have a lot of trouble with that.
Speaker 2: Isn't that funny?
Speaker 1: It is.  It is.
Speaker 2: Hah!  Oh my goodness.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: We must be in present time.  I'm sorry, go ahead.
Story_ID: 314901
Speaker 1: I'm going to just ask you five very, very simple questions, and they tell us that it's to relax the person being interviewed, but it is also to relax the interviewer (laughter).  So, that's the--so, and they can be done with very simple answers.  First of all, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Hmm.  My favorite food is apple cobbler.
Speaker 1: That's mine, too.  Your favorite--what is your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Red.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Your favorite vacation spot?
Speaker 2: Ah!  Oh, my favorite vacation spot right now, it has changed over the years--is Cabo San Lucas [Mexico].
Speaker 1: Ah.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Right now.
Speaker 1: And Cab- where's that?
Speaker 2: That's in Baja California[KS1], which is really in Mexico.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: My next favorite place, if I may, (laughing) is the Bahamas.  I like going to the Ocean Club in Nassau, Bahamas.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What is your favorite season?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, that's kinda hard living in California.  (Laughing)
Speaker 1: Time of year.  Right.
Speaker 2: 'Cause it seems like we have only one season out here.  But, I like the fall.  I like the transition period.  Even though in California you think we only have one season.  We really do have seasons, and I like to call it fall even though the leaves don't change--don't change like they do on the East Coast, but I do like the fall.
Speaker 1: Well, I think California has four seasons.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know, fire, earthquakes.  (Laughter) Mudslides.
Speaker 2: No, Paul [HistoryMaker Paul Brock] (laughter)!
Speaker 1: Okay.  And finally, what is your favorite saying or phrase?
Speaker 2: Hmm.  I'll paraphrase it.  It was something that I believe Teddy Roosevelt [President Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.] said, and it, it says "It is not the critic that is important.  It is not the bearer of bad news.  It is the person who is in the arena.  It is the person who continues the fight no matter what.  Even with failures they get up.  They fall down and they get up."  And then there's a line in there that says, "I want to live my life spent.  I want to live my life to the fullest."  I've paraphrased it, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.  That's good.
Speaker 2: That's, that's one of my favorite things.
Speaker 1: All right.  Good, I think.  Now, I'm going to ask you about your date of birth.
Speaker 2: Umm.  This is going on camera, right?
Speaker 1: Yes, it is.  Yes, it is.
Speaker 2: You know you're not supposed to ask a lady her date of birth.  But anyway, it's March 3rd, 1945.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your place of birth?
Speaker 2: Lexington, Mississippi.
Story_ID: 314902
Speaker 1: Now, what I want to do is see how far back we can go into your mother's side of the family and relatives, and then how far back we can go on your father's [Roosevelt Winston] side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  First of all, on your mother's side, let's get your mother's name.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Full name first.
Speaker 2: Okay.  My mother's name is--was Selena, S-E-L-E-N-A, Thurmond, T-H-U-R-M-O-N-D, Winston.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Good.  And your mother's place of birth?  What was her--
Speaker 2: She was born, I believe, in Lexington, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your mother's date of birth?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't really know my mother, so I don't know her date of birth.  What I know is that she--I think she was born in 1924.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  And we'll hold that, and so to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, okay.  Okay.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, how far back can you take us from stories you've heard, or on your mother's family?
Speaker 2: On my mother's family, what I've heard is that my maternal grandmother's name was Cora [ph.].  That's really all that I know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Cora Thurmond.  I don't know her maiden name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then Cora Thurmond, your grandmother--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --Do you know who she was married to?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And we can't go back any further than that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.
Speaker 1: That's fine.  That's fine.
Story_ID: 314903
Speaker 1: Let's go to your father's side of the family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: His full name?
Speaker 2: Roosevelt, R-O-O-S-E-V-E-L-T, Winston.  Actually it's Roosevelt Love Winston.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the date of his birth?
Speaker 2: Eleven, fourteen, 1925 [November 14, 1925].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the place of his birth?
Speaker 2: I believe it was Morgan, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Now, how far back can you take us on your father's side, your fraternal [sic.] side?  How far back can you take us to his family?
Speaker 2: I think I can go back to his great-grandmother.  His mother's name was Ola, O-L-A.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, are you saying his great-grandmother, or you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  That's his mother's name.
Speaker 1: That--oh, that.  Right.
Speaker 2: Which one do you want me to do first, his mother or his--
Speaker 1: Let's go ahead.  We can do his mother.
Speaker 2: Or you want to do it the other way?
Speaker 1: Either way.  Okay, let's go back to his--can you go back as far as his great, great- wait?
Speaker 2: I can go back to his--
Speaker 1: --his great-grandmother--
Speaker 2: --Great.  I can go back to--let's see.  His mother, his grandmother, his great-grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And her name was Kizzie.
Speaker 1: K-I-S-S?
Speaker 2: K-I-Z-Z-I-E, Kizzie.  They called her Kizzi.  I don't know why, but they called her Kizzi Rancher, R-A-N-C-H-E-R.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And her daughter's name was--
Speaker 1: Date of birth?  Do you have any--?
Speaker 2: I, I don't know.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: You don't have any of that information?
Speaker 2: No.  No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that was his great-grandmother.
Speaker 1: Great-grandmother.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Then his grandmother's name was Lucy, L-U-C-Y, Hadden, H-A-D-D-E-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she was married to John Hadden, H-A-D-D-E-N.
Story_ID: 314904
Speaker 1: This was your father's [Roosevelt Winston] great-grandmother, Kizzie [Rancher].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --And your father's grandmother, Lucy [Hadden]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.  And your father's mom?
Speaker 2: Mother.  Her name was Ola, O-L-A, Rancher.  Now, it's interesting, because she went by the name of Ola Rancher because her grandmother raised her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --But her father's name was Peter Ward, W-A-R-D, but she went by the name of Ola Rancher because her grandmother raised her--.
Speaker 1: Raised.  Okay.
Speaker 2: --Whose name was Kizzie Rancher.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But her father was Peter Ward.
Speaker 2: Peter Ward, W-A-R-D.  And, as far as I know, she was born January 10th, 1894.
Speaker 1: Okay.  1894?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, in Sumner County, Alabama, and she died in 1944.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so, she lived--
Speaker 2: She was fifty.
Speaker 1: --Was fifty.  Fifty.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: And then she married my father's father--
Speaker 1: That was--that was your mother?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My father's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  Father's--your, your father's mother?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Ola--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --Rancher, and then she died in 1944.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  Now we're looking at your father's father.
Speaker 2: His name was William Love Winston, and he died in 1964.  Oh, I'm sorry.  He was born in Sumner County, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Sumner County.  Good.  And we don't have any information on the date of birth?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--okay.  Now, and that, of course, was your grandfather (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --On your father's side.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: William Love Winston.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 314905
Speaker 1: Any other details that seem to pop up on Kizzie Rancher or Lucy Hadden, John Hadden?  Any, any of the grandfathers, fathers (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Any--you mean, any information about them?
Speaker 1: Any information that you might have.  What they did.  Were they farmers or--
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, yes.  My [paternal] grandmother [Ola Rancher], she basically took care of the children.  There were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  Now your, your grandmother would have been Ola.
Speaker 2: Ola.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: She, she--of course, she died a year before I was born, but I'm told that she really took care of the children, and they were really farmers.  So they did sharecropping--no, that was actually my grandfather [William Love Winston] became a sharecropper, but they were farmers and then--and, and I think Kizzie [Rancher] was also a farmer.  So they all lived on the farm in Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All farmers.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And then my grandfather--
Speaker 1: William Love.
Speaker 2: William Love Winston.  It's interesting, because when they lived in Alabama, they got out of--they left Alabama and moved to Mississippi, and I'm told that they had to leave in a hurry.
Speaker 1: From Mis-, from Alabama?
Speaker 2: From Alabama.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Did we have a sense of what year?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm also--let's.  Yes, because the older children were born in Alabama, and then my father [Roosevelt Winston] was born in Mississippi, so I would imagine it was around like '20 [1920], 1925 or there--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --around that time because the two older children were born in Alabama, but then my father was born in Mississippi.
Speaker 1: In--okay.  Good to know.
Speaker 2: And then I'm told that my grandfather worked in the mines which I didn't understand.  I didn't know that there were mines in Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I didn't know that either.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but it had something to do with mines, and then I remember when I was a little girl, I actually remember my grandfather.  And, he was a sharecropper at the time, and he lived in Sunflower, Mississippi, and that was Fannie Lou Hamer (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --and all of that, and my grandfather was a sharecropper at the time.
Story_ID: 314906
Speaker 1: I can see just as clearly now the house that he [Winston's grandfather, William Love Winston] lived in, and it was a two--it was like a shack.  It was a two-room shack.  I remember an outhouse.  I remember newspaper on the walls to keep out the cold.
Speaker 2: Cold.
Speaker 1: Cold air.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: I remember a round stove.  I think they call it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Potbelly?
Speaker 1: --a potbelly stove.  I remember that in the middle of the front room and that's what kept the house warm.  I remember--I remember cotton fields.  I remember his working outside--
Speaker 2: Do you--can you see yourself as being, what, three or four?
Speaker 1: I think I was like four, maybe four or five.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --But then I also see--this is a very vivid memory.  It was like the end of the season or something and they were celebrating, and they--there was a big party and they were--there's like a pig or something that they were roasting outside.  And, my grandfather had made some very potent--
Speaker 2: Strong!
Speaker 1: Strong drinks (laughter).  And, and I remember being mesmerized by all of these people that were having so much fun because--and I remember it must've been like the end of the season or something, and they were cele-
Speaker 2: Hog killing time.
Speaker 1: Hog killing time.  And I--oh!  Now, see you made me think of something else.  I remember there was another building where it was the--I think they called it the curing house where the meat was cured.
Speaker 2: Smokehouse.
Speaker 1: Smokehouse.  That's it.  The smokehouse where the slabs as they called them.  The slabs of meat was hanging in there and there was a lot--I remember there was lots of salt on it.  I think that's how they cured it.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: So I remembered that, and I remember my grandfather behind a horse, and I remember him working very, very, very hard out there in the sun.  And I remember--
Speaker 2: Do you remember whether you're standing, or sometimes they used the young children to sit on the plow to keep it in the ground?
Speaker 1: I don't see that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I mean, I was--I remember going there to be with my grandfather, but I don't remember working.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I do remember being in the fields with him.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: When I was little.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I remember him as a tall, very dignified man; not educated, but hard worker.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I remember that.  I remember he loved me very much.  My grandfather (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's wonderful.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I really do remember that.
Speaker 2: Let's go back--and if we can, we may not be able to--but I want to just ask about the education level--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --Of Kizzie [Rancher] and then Lucy [Hadden] and John [Hadden].
Speaker 1: Okay.  My suspicion is that they were uneducated.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --And I say that for several reasons.  I remember my grandfather, I don't remember his being able to read and write.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I remember like a mark.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: For my grandfather.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: And then my aunt [Bertha Mae Winston Williams] who raised me, which we have not talked about, she was not well educated either.  So, my suspicion is that if by her generation if they weren't educated, my suspicion is that her parents weren't, nor were her grandparents.
Speaker 2: Right.  No one really made a great effort to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, and I think it's--I don't think it's that they didn't make a great effort because I actually found something of my aunt's school record--
Speaker 2: Actually, I meant the officials.
Speaker 1: Oh, oh.
Speaker 2: The white officials.
Speaker 1: The officials, exactly.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Because they did work on the farms, and I do remember also that there was no compulsory educational law in the State of Mississippi.  I remember that.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Even when I--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --was a little kid, there was no rule that said we had to go to school.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then the school terms were around the crops if, particularly, if you lived in the country--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --As my grandfather did.
Speaker 2: Planting and harvesting time--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Exactly.
Speaker 2: --were non-school times.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Story_ID: 314907
Speaker 1: Let's go now to your mother [Selena Thurmond Winston].  How many siblings did your mother have?
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: And, that part you did not know?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay.
Speaker 2: As far as I know, when she left, and it's my understanding that she left when I was either two or three years old, and then that's when I went to live with my aunt [Bertha Mae Winston Williams].  At that point, I was her only child, so I don't know if she had other children or what.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  Okay.  Good enough.  Let's take a look at it because I want to establish that family there--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --For your father [Roosevelt Winston].  How about your father's siblings?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  My father, his sister was Bertha Mae.
Speaker 1: Do you know if she was the oldest by the way?
Speaker 2: She was the eldest child, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Bertha Mae.
Speaker 2: Bertha Mae Love Winston, and then she became Bertha Mae Love Winston Pampley Williams.  (Laughter)
Speaker 1: Oh, my!  Give me those last two again.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  And, and those are wonderful stories by the way.
Speaker 1: Wonderful.
Speaker 2: Pampley, P-A-M-P-L-E-Y, and then another name, Williams.
Speaker 1: Williams, okay.
Speaker 2: And she was my father's sister.  She was the eldest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she was born January 15th, 1915.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she was born in, I believe, Sumner County--yes, Sumner County, Alabama, and she died November 18th, 1987, and she was, in fact, my mother as far as I'm concerned.
Speaker 1: Okay.  November 18th, 19--?
Speaker 2: Eighty-seven [1987].
Speaker 1: Eighty-seven [1987].
Speaker 2: And then the next child was William Love Winston, Jr.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he actually went by the name of William Love once he left Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: And he, too, was born in Sumner County, Alabama, and he died, oh, I actually have his birth date.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was born December 25th, 1917.
Speaker 1: On Christmas?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventeen [1917].  Okay.
Speaker 2: And I don't remember the date of his birth--I mean of his death, but he died in New York City [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uncle Love.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And then there were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  And, of course, he was probably born in Sumner County.
Speaker 2: Yes, he was.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: And he died in New York City [New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then there were two other children that died very young.  Sadie Lee Winston [ph.].
Speaker 1: Sadie Lee.
Speaker 2: --And I'm told that she was nine or ten years old when she died.  I don't know when she was born, and she died of tonsillitis.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, we know she was born after 1917 (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She was born after '17 [1917], yeah 'cause she was the third child.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then there was Lucy Belle Winston [ph.].
Speaker 1: Lucy--
Speaker 2: And so she was therefore born after Sadie.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she died as an infant they told me, and she died from whooping cough.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then my father [Roosevelt Winston] was the youngest of the children--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --And he was born November 14th, 1925.  I think I've told you that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  He was the youngest.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 314908
Speaker 1: Now, do you have any information on your father [Roosevelt Winston] growing up, how far he went in school or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All I--no, I don't.
Speaker 1: Well, what it was like.  I'm sure it was a farm life.
Speaker 2: Yes, and then I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I know he went into the [U.S.] Navy--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at a young age.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: He went into the U.S. Navy.  That's all I know because I didn't live with him, so I never really got any information on him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I know later on--I know he was like a long-distance truck driver, that kind of thing.  As far as education is concerned, I'm--I know he didn't go to college--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --And I'm not sure how far in high school he went.  My Aunt Bertha [Bertha Mae Winston Williams], mama, she--I believe she went no further than the eighth grade.  I want to say even--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I'm remembering eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Good enough.
Speaker 2: So then I became like the big hope (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: --of the family.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.  The--okay.  Now your mother [Selena Thurmond Winston], of course, we don't know.
Speaker 2: We're talking biological mother; is that what you're talking--? (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, biological, I'm sorry.
Story_ID: 314909
Speaker 1: What I wanted to do was take us through that period where your mother [Selena Thurmond Winston]--your biological mother and father [Roosevelt Winston] meet and they have the one child, you.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Let's go through that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --then they have--
Speaker 2: And I know it sounds strange talking about biological mother and biological father, but it's important because of--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --the family structure, and so my mother, Selena, was eighteen years old when I was born.  So, I would imagine she was seventeen or so, you know, of course when she got pregnant.  My father was twenty when I was born, so I imagine they were both teenagers when I was born.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So they went to--they got married, I was born.  They went to live with his older sister, Bertha [Bertha Mae Winston Williams].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Bertha--really even though they were there in her home, she was basically taking care of me.  And for whatever reasons, they never really told me the reasons, Selena left and as far as I know, she went to St. Louis, Missouri.  I actually tried to find her and there was no record of her in St. Louis.  But I'm told that she went to St. Louis and then soon thereafter, my father left and I believe he joined the [U.S.] Navy at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so from that--and I was--I was either two or three years old and at that time, then Bertha and Louis [Louis Pampley], whom we haven't talked about, Bertha and Louis raised me as their child.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I was raised by my aunt and uncle, Aunt Bertha and Uncle Louis, but to me they were mama [Bertha Mae Love Winston] and daddy [Louis Pampley], and for many years, I didn't know that they weren't my parents.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So--and I found that out from the neighborhood kids (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Who found it out from their parents.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But when I speak of my mother, most often I'm talking about Bertha.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --Because she's the one that really made me who I am.
Speaker 1: And from now on, for a point of clarification when you speak of your mother, we will be talking about Bertha.
Speaker 2: We were talking about Bertha, but then there's another--.  Oh, my life is really--it's full of drama (laughter)
Speaker 1: Let's--we won't get too far yet.
Speaker 2: Then I got another mother.
Speaker 1: --And then when we talk about dad, we'll be talking about--.
Speaker 2: Louis.
Speaker 1: Louis.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, because Louis was married to--
Speaker 2: Bertha.
Speaker 1: Bertha.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  I just wanted to make sure that we had it straight.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: For the record.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 314910
Speaker 1: You are growing up.  You're so very young, two or three years old, and Bertha [Bertha Mae Winston Williams] is your mother.  You are growing up in Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Yes, in Greenville, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: In Greenville, Mississippi.  And what is life like there, growing up in Greenville, Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Well, we were very poor.  Education was the primary concern of my mom and because of that, she--when I started school, she started me in the parochial school even though we weren't Catholics.  But the parochial school was the best school in town, so my mother decided that's where I was gonna go, which meant she had to pay for me to go to school.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And she was a maid, and I remember her making like fifteen dollars a week.  And I remember tuition was something--I don't remember the exact amount of the tuition, but it was a hardship for her, but she did it.  And so I remember things like--I was actually quite spoiled.  We were very poor, and so what?  Everybody else in the neighborhood was poor also.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: But I remember birthday parties.  I remember bicycles.  I remember getting A's in school and having everybody be so excited because I was getting A's, and it was always stressed that I was going to graduate from high school, and I was gonna go to college, and everybody--my mother, my father [Louis Pampley], the whole neighborhood--everybody was like, "Hattie Mae [HistoryMaker Hattie Winston]!  Hattie Mae!  Hattie Mae!"  And then I was the kind of kid that I always spoke my mind, and they encouraged that in me, and it got me in trouble a lot, but it really made me who I am today.  Mississippi was segregated at that time, and my mother always taught me to respect my elders, and I didn't understand it when some white person would come to our house and just walk in our house without knocking, or I was always taught that I had to call--put a handle on it, as they said--somebody's name.  I had to say, Miss so-and-so, and Mr. so-and-so if they were older than me, you know, and I didn't understand how young white people could come to my house and call my mother by her first name.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I just didn't understand that, and I would do things sometimes that would get me in trouble.  (Laughter) I would see them coming and I'd put the latch on the screen door and I wouldn't let 'em in.  And they caught--they'd say, "Is Bertha home?" and I'd said, "Who?"  And then they'd say, "Bertha!" and I'd say, "Well, do you mean Mrs. Pampley?"  And later on I'd say, "Do you mean Mrs. Williams?"  And they'd look at me like I was crazy, and I wouldn't let 'em in my house.  I'd talk to them through the screen door and until they would recognize my mother, I wouldn't let 'em in.  And my mother used to say to me, "Lord, Hattie Mae, you gonna get killed." (Laughter)
Speaker 1: (Laughter) She had something there.
Speaker 2: And so as a matter of fact, some of the kids that I went to gramm- elementary school with in Mississippi, in Greenville, they're still my friends today.
Speaker 1: Wonderful![KS1]
Speaker 2: Yes.  I still have friends in Greenville, Mississippi, and I still go back occasionally, and I call and I say, "I'm on my way," and there they are, and recently one of my friends called, and I had been not well, and they were--they're getting ready to drive up here from Mississippi to make sure I was okay.  So I still have friends in Greenville.
Story_ID: 314911
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about Uncle Louis [Louis Pampley].
Speaker 2: Oh, Uncle Louis [Pampley].  Uncle Louis was--Daddy was a quiet man.  I understand--he had a son by a first marriage and his son's name was M.C. [M.C. Pampley, Sr.] and M.C. was like my big brother, and he tells me or he used to--he's passed now--he used to tell me stories that Daddy was a big man, he was a boxer.  He was like two hundred pounds and he was a boxer, but when I--and M.C. was much older than me, but so when he and mama [Bertha Mae Winston Williams] were together, he apparently had changed his ways.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was very soft-spoken, a hard worker.  He worked--he worked at the lumber mill, and I found out that his father also worked at a lumber mill.  And then when Louis worked at the lumber mill, he was in a position that was not the kind of position that Negroes had in those days.  He was a foreman.
Speaker 1: Wow!
Speaker 2: And he was over the white workers and the black workers and that was unheard of, and he would always say--I remember him telling stories and then later on when, when he and mama separated because of his job and I would go visit him, the people would--some of the white workers would say something to him and he'd go, "I know you didn't mean to raise your voice."  And he'd go, "Oh, Louis!  I'm sorry."  (Laughter) So he was--he was very soft-spoken but when he spoke, people paid attention.  And I remember when I was a little girl my mother, Bertha, was the disciplinarian, and I'd never got whippings frequently, but when I did, mama, she had the memory of an elephant, and she'd tell me to go in there and take my clothes off and she'd pull up a chair, and she'd say, "You remember six months ago, Hattie Mae [HistoryMaker Hattie Winston], when I told you not to da-da-da."  I'd go, "Oh, Momma!"  I started screaming before she even touched me.  And then she'd say, "Do you remember three months ago, Hattie Mae, I told you and you did it anyway?"  "Oh, Mama, Mama!"  And so then she would hit me like two or three times, and then daddy would say, "Alright, Bertha.  I think that's enough."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, he was, you know--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --Very quiet and then I'd go screaming, "Oh, daddy, mama beat me up," and he said, "Did you do those things your mama said you did?"  "Yes, Daddy, but--"  "Well then, will you do them again?"  "No, daddy, I won't."  "Well then your mama was right."  You know, so he was--he was very quiet.  He had--he was very stern, set in his ways.  I remember also one time I wanted a bicycle and--no, no!  It wasn't a bicycle!  I wanted playing cards.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He wouldn't buy them for me, because to him that was like gambling, although he used to gamble.
Speaker 1: Okay.  "Used to" was the big word.
Speaker 2: Used to gamble.  But I--'cause all the kids had them and I wanted them and he said, "No."  And so being the little spoiled brat that I was, you know, shouted, "I want a bicycle!"  And he said, "We'll see about that," and he worked like for six months to save up the down payment for the bicycle, and he must have paid on that bicycle for the next five or ten years.  You understand what I'm saying?
Speaker 1: Just fifty cents a week or something.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Fifty cents a week, like that.  Because he--they didn't make a lot of money.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 314912
Speaker 1: Now there was a time when my mama [Bertha Mae Winston Williams] decided that she had to augment her income.  And she had learned certain things from her father [William Love Winston].  (Laughter) So, mama decided that she was gonna sell some corn liquor.  And she did.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This was her first attempt at selling corn liquor?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And so she did and--
Speaker 2: And Alabama was a dry state?
Speaker 1: No, Mississippi.
Speaker 2: I mean--I'm sorry.  Mississippi was a dry state?
Speaker 1: Yes, it was.  Yes, it was.  And so she taught me things like whenever--the door always had to be locked and if I didn't know somebody who came to the door, don't ever let them in, and I also learned stuff, like if the police should show up, I knew how to dispose of it, you know.  And one of my favorite stories is--I don't remember exactly how old I was, but I remember we were--it was almost time for school, and she was taking me to get polio shots, polio vaccination.  And so she'd always said to me, "When you go outside the door, let me know so I can hook the door, hook the screen door."  So I'm sitting on the back steps and I'm polishing my shoes because, you know, if you went someplace, you always had to look nice.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, your clothes had to be ironed, your shoes had to be shined, and so I was going to get a polio shot, but I had to get dressed up.  So, I'm sitting on the steps and in the back there were these tall hedges at our back door and I saw these feet.  I said, "Mama, mama!  It's the police!  It's the police!"  And she had not locked the door.  So she's in there trying to dispose of the liquor, and I grabbed the police by the feet and started biting.  (Laughter) I started biting them so she could--she could get rid of the stuff.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And they, of course, came in and they found like a little drop and they carted her off to jail and all that stuff, and I had been drilled, so I knew to go to my godmother's house and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --da-da-da, and they absolutely destroyed our house.  I mean, they just totally destroyed our house.  But I remember so many--so many things about growing up in Mississippi.
Story_ID: 314913
Speaker 1: There was a family that--a black family--that was rich, and we all just looked up to them, and they owned the local movie theater.  There were two theaters in town.  One was owned by the Bridges, and the other was the--I believe it was the Paramount [Paramount Theater, Greenville, Mississippi] downtown where we had to sit up in the balcony in the nosebleed section.  But we'd go to the Bridges' Theater [Greenville, Mississippi] and we'd stay there all day, and I'll never forget, the daughter's name was Betty Jean Bridges [ph.] and--oh!  What was the son's name?  I think his name was Billy [ph.], 'cause I had a crush on him.  But they were like--oh my God!  They were so rich.  They had cars and big houses.  It was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  They were real rich.
Speaker 1: They were real rich, you know.  We had to walk to school and walk along the highway, and I was thinking about that recently because it must've been at least two, maybe three--I don't know--it was a long way to school, but we had to walk it every day.  You know, walk to school and then walk back, even though we were in this little town, we weren't out in the country.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But we walked to school.
Speaker 2: Now let me ask you, did Louis [Louis Pampley] and Bertha [Bertha Mae Winston Williams], did they have any other children?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you were that only (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I was it.
Speaker 2: --child, spoiled.
Speaker 1: I was it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And--
Speaker 1: He did have an older son by a first marriage and that, as I said, that was M.C. [M.C. Pampley, Sr.], and so he was like my big brother.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And he, he died, was it 2000?  I think it was 2000 he died, and he was great (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.  So there were times you were kept out of school because you had to be there on the farm?
Speaker 1: No, no.  See, we lived--that was for my grandfather [William Love Winston], but they never kept me out of school.  My mother  worked as a maid and she worked as a--sometimes she would go and work in the farms, but she would never let me do it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: She was determined, determined that I would go to school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Determined!  Oh, no.  And I remember those trucks coming by at four o'clock in the morning sometimes to pick her up, you know, and pick up other people when she wasn't working as a housekeeper.
Speaker 2: Right.  So she was a hard worker.
Speaker 1: Oh, she was a very hard worker.  A very hard worker.  And, of course, I'd get into trouble because we would--sometimes I'd go down to her job and she worked for these very wealthy white people and, of course, I was supposed to go in the back door.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I did it, and then I got sick of it, 'cause I didn't understand it.  I mean, I understood it but I didn't want to do it.  So I would go and knock on the front door and I knew I wasn't supposed to do that, but I'm like why not?  And my mother would say, "Lord, Hattie Mae [HistoryMaker Hattie Winston], you gonna get killed."  (Laughter) But she never--actually I think she was kinda proud of the fact that I would (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That you had the courage.
Speaker 1: --that I would do things like that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And she was--she was always--I always tried to make her very proud, you know.  I always tried to make sure that I did well in school because I knew that that was very, very important to her.
Story_ID: 314914
Speaker 1: Now Mississippi, in the meantime, it's changing.  Things are getting wee bit better.  You didn't happen to see any lynchings or anything, so that was better (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  No, I didn't.  I didn't see any lynchings, but I did live up in--I did live in a time where once my mother [Bertha Mae Winston Williams] had saved money, for example, to buy me something for school--.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --And we would go downtown to the stores and we'd have to kind of guess if it would fit me or not, because we weren't allowed to try anything on--
Speaker 1: Oh, right.  Right.  Right.
Speaker 2: --And to me, that was insulting and that was degrading.  And so what would happen is my mother--I mean she'd worked so hard to save this money, she'd always buy the stuff big, and then she'd have to try to take it in so it could fit me.  Now, "Why should she have to do this," I would always say.  So, one of my earliest vows was I was getting out of there.  I was not--I knew early on that I was not going to stay in Mississippi because I knew I would get killed (laughter) as my mother said.  So, and it was indeed segregated, you know.  Blacks lived in one section of town, and the whites lived in another section of town, and you very rarely crossed those lines.  At the school, it was interesting though because, as I said, I went to Sacred Heart School [Greenville, Mississippi] which was the Catholic school, and the nuns were all white.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And the, the minis-, the pastor, the priest rather, was white, and there was one African American teacher there, Mrs. Coleman, and, but all the nuns were white.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So I never understood it because we--I had these white teachers, you know, in the '50s [1950s] in Mississippi that I was dealing with every day, and then I go downtown and then these other white people look at me like I'm dirt.  And then over here at school, I have these nuns that were really, really encouraging us to do and be the very best that we could be.  I remember when, the first time I went to school in New York [New York], and I went to a parochial school.  I was going to go to a parochial school in New York, St. Bernard's [St. Bernard's School, New York, New York], and they assumed that because I came from Mississippi that I would probably have to be tutored, or I would probably have to be put in a lower grade.  So they tested me and, of course, I tested higher than the eighth grade students that were in that school because the nuns had made sure--that was their--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --that was their, if you will, ministry, and they only dealt with--they only taught Negro children because that was a part of their order, to make sure that we were given the same opportunities as the white students were.  And there was one other school--black school, in my town.  The public school, and our education was far superior, and there was always a rivalry between Sacred Heart and Coleman High [Coleman High School, Greenville, Mississippi], and I remember getting beat up many a day (laughter) by the kids from Coleman.
Speaker 1: Going to the wrong school.
Speaker 2: Oh, I was--yeah, I remember they used to, you know, "Who do you think you are," you know.  (Laughter) And I used to go home crying because there was--these kids would beat me up every day, and one day my mother said to me, "Hattie Mae [HistoryMaker Hattie Winston], if you come home crying one more time, I'm gonna give you something to cry about," and I knew what that meant.  (Laughter) The next time I went, I was walking home from school and there was one sidewalk on one--the sidewalk was only on one side of the street--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --And this girl used to just--every day, she'd elbow me, or kick me, or knock me down or something, and my mother said, "Hattie Mae, you come--" (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  No more.
Speaker 2: --no more.  And I knew I had to either fight that girl or get a beating when I got home, and I chose her.  And them nuns had to come and get me (laughter).  Because I was like, "Oh, no!  You're not pushing me anymore!"  And so I went home and I was crying, and my mother said, "Hattie Mae."  I said, "Mom, but I won!  I won!  I won!"  And so then, of course, she sat me down and talked to me and said, "You know, fighting is not the answer."
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: "But sometimes you have to stand up for yourself.  You have to defend yourself.  You can't let people pick on you."
Speaker 1: You cannot.  You cannot.
Speaker 2: And that--those were her words.  "You can't let people pick on you," you know, but fighting is not the way.  So, I was like, "But I won, Mama!  I won!"
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So these were the lessons you were learning from grandma--
Speaker 2: Aunt Bertha.
Speaker 1: Aunt Bertha (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Mama Bertha, Aunt Bertha.
Speaker 1: --But, you were calling her mama, Bertha?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Mama.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 314915
Speaker 1: You also were learning very important lessons from daddy, Louie [Louis Pampley]?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  I remember when I was little--and so mama [Bertha Mae Winston Williams] went from selling liquor to becoming a minister, which is very interesting.  And daddy never went to church, but he was probably one of the most religious people I knew.  People used to come from all around just to sit and talk to him, and he would counsel people.  He was always trying to help people.  And there was a point when they actually separated, and so--and it was because of his work, 'cause the work moved to Memphis [Tennessee], and so he took it as an opportunity, and then he'd try to come home every weekend.  It was a long trip from Greenville [Mississippi] to Memphis every Friday night, and then turn around Sunday night and go back.  And so they kind of grew apart, which was really kind of sad, but I would always go to visit him in Memphis and he lived on the lumberyard where he worked.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He actually lived there.  And every night when he would go to bed, under his bed--and by this time he was walking with a cane--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --There would be his gun and his Bible.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: So he said he had everything covered (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, I'm sure he did!
Speaker 2: You know, because this was still the segregated South.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And then again, education was the key.  It's like he would always say--he called me Nunsey [ph.] and I was like, "What?"  They used to call me Tee Nunsey [ph.] 'cause I was a little skinny thing.  And he would say, as I said, that people would come and talk to him and sit on the porch and stuff and he'd say, "Nunsey, why don't you go get your report card," you know, and then I have to come and show everybody my report card, or I'd have to come and read some book or something like that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: --for everybody, so, it was--
Speaker 1: So you, you were a fairly good student in school--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, I was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Got good marks--
Speaker 2: I always liked school.
Speaker 1: --And the nuns were saying, "Oh well, she's gonna grow up to be something."
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And, and it's fair to say that--I would say a good 85 percent of the kids that I went to school with, they all are very successful.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  So the whole class--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --were over-achievers.
Speaker 2: It's like those friends that I was talking about, one of them now--she's a principal of a high school in Mississippi.  The other one is--my other girlfriend, Butch [ph.], she is a account--she's a therapist, a speech therapist.  So, you've got doctors, lawyers, dentists, speech therapists, educators.  They really did okay.  They did okay.  And then we--of course, we had our mortician, (laughter) one of the girls became a mortician.  So they really--the nuns were, they were very good to us.
Speaker 1: Now let me ask you.  The nuns (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --were they white and black or--
Speaker 2: No, they were all white.
Speaker 1: They were all--
Speaker 2: Sisters of Charity.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So no--there were no black nuns in the Sisters of Charity?
Speaker 2: No, no.  Not at my school.  There may have been someplace else, but they were not at my school, and we only had Mrs. Coleman [ph.], who was African American.  She was one of the teachers there, and I think there was another African American teacher that came in later, but all the nuns were white.
Story_ID: 316417
Speaker 1: Now you're growing up in Mississippi during the time of the Civil Rights Movement.  A lot of things are going on there, and you're beginning to see things and wondering and questioning it.  Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Well, I began to notice that--I mean, segregation became more and more apparent.  The, the economic conditions became more and more apparent.  And it wasn't just the disrespect, I mean, I would hear--now, you have to remember that I was--I mean, I was young, but I was, you know, like twelve and thirteen years old and I was hearing stuff, and I was hearing about people disappearing.  I'd never, of course, witnessed anyone being killed or anything, but I heard about people who disappeared.  The other thing about Greenville [Mississippi] was that we were a small town, and I remember seeing chain gangs in Mississippi, and what they would do is they would have people who were in prison, they would become the city workers, and I remember seeing prisoners in black and white striped clothing with chains on their ankles doing work around the courtyard, doing work around the town.  We were always being threatened with an institution in Mississippi which was called Parchman [Mississippi State Penitentiary, Parchman, Mississippi].  Parchman was a prison, and they've done many movies about it, and where the chain gangs really, really existed.  I don't remember the man's name, but I remember stories like a black man going to jail for life for stealing a loaf of bread.  And then you say, of course, stealing is wrong.  That's true, but you don't give a life sentence--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --for stealing a loaf of bread.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So these things were becoming more and more apparent.  When I would look at, when I would look at the newspapers, there was a great disparity to me between the white newspaper, and I believe it was Washington--no, it was Delta Democratic Times [sic. Delta Democrat Times], that's what it was, and then we had our black paper and I can't remember the name of the paper now, I'm so sorry.
Speaker 1: Jackson Advocate?
Speaker 2: The Advocate, I think, but it is like--and then of course we had Jet magazine, and we had all these things, and then I remember--I don't remember how old I was, but I remember very vividly when Emmett Till was killed.  I remember that.  And that had to be (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How did that impact you?  What, what did you--
Speaker 2: Because I saw that picture in Jet magazine and I realized that that could be me.  And I didn't understand why you had to mutilate someone to that degree because they whistled at a white woman.  When I saw things, for example, on the block where I lived, we lived on one end and there was another family at the other end of the block, and, of course, we all considered them very, very rich because their house looked far superior to ours.  They had two stories to their house.  We only had one.  We had like three rooms to our house--no, four rooms to our house.  And once a week I used to see this big shiny car that would pull up to this house, and these were people that I went to school with.  We were at the Catholic school [Sacred Heart School, Greenville, Mississippi] together.  And this man would get out of this car--this white man would get out of the car, the chauffeur would open the door and let him out, and he'd go inside and he'd stay there for hours and hours, and then he would leave.  Well, this was a white man--this was his black family on our side of town, and then he had his white family on the other side of town.  Now, these young people were catching hell because they didn't fit into any society and years later, of course, I found out that the young man did indeed commit suicide, because there was no place--he--and this is in Mississippi.  We're not talking New York or California.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.
Speaker 2: This is in the State of Mississippi and this was--these kids didn't fit in.  They were in the black community, but they had a white father.  They, they were--they had stuff that the other black kids didn't have, so the black kids were giving them a hard time, and I'm like "What's going on here."  And I remember saying to my mother [Winston's paternal aunt, Bertha Mae Winston Williams], "I'm getting out of here."  And she'd go "Lord, Hattie Mae [HistoryMaker Hattie Winston]," but all along I know she was glad because if--she was the one that was teaching me all of this stuff.  I saw how hard she worked and I didn't feel that--and that's not to say--my father [Winston's paternal uncle, Lewis Pampley] worked just as hard and I saw how hard the two of them worked, and they could never seem to get from under those bills, and they were never extravagant people.  They were just trying to make a living and take care of their child.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.
Speaker 2: And it didn't seem fair to me for them to have to go through all that.  And I certainly--I watched kids that were a year or two older than me, and I watched them having baby after baby after--and I said, "I'm not doing that."
Story_ID: 316418
Speaker 1: How old was Hattie Mae [HistoryMaker Hattie Winston] during this period, approximately (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was twelve or thirteen years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was like, No.  Unh-uh.  I'm not having no--I'm not having any babies.  (Laughter) No, no.  I am not gonna end up like that!
Speaker 1: So you were beginning to make personal decisions (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --as to how your life was going to go--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --and what you wanted to achieve--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --with your life.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was also at that time in school, I was singing in school, and, of course, I was singing in church and I was doing the children's programs and the Easter program, and I was reciting things at church and I was reciting things at school and being introduced (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So was there sort of an itch at that time that you wanted to be an actress or singer?
Speaker 2: I think it was--I think--well at that time, it was more the singing, and one of the girlfriends of mine, she tells the story--I don't remember it, but she tells the story that when we were younger, and I don't remember how old I was, 'Carmen Jones' came out in the movies, or at least they were running it at that time, and the nuns had told us we could not go see 'Carmen Jones.'  And so my girlfriend, Butch, Nola Ann [ph.] was her name and we called her Butch, she's was like "Oh, we can't go."  I said, "What do you mean we can't go?"  So, she says, "Well, Sister whatever her name is said we can't go," because, you know, Dorothy Dandridge is wearing all these low-cut clothes and she was wearing red.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  And so we couldn't go.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So I told them, I said, "I don't care.  I'm going!"
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So I did!  As long as my mother would let me go, my mother didn't see anything wrong with it--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and she said it was okay.  I said, "I don't care what these nuns say, and I'm not Catholic anyway.  I just go to a Catholic school."
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  I said, "I'm going!"
Speaker 1: You were going.
Speaker 2: I was going, and I did and I remember--I remember that red skirt from--that Dorothy Dandridge had on, and I was like, "Wow!"  To see a person of color who was not subservient, that looked good and carried herself in a certain way, and was proud of who she was, and was madly in love, and I knew my parents loved each other.  That was demonstrated all the time, but you didn't see that all the time in the theaters, in the movies.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: At that time they weren't--we called them the movies, you know, the movie house.  Of course, when we went to the Bridges' Theater [Greenville, Mississippi] we did see--you know, we could see the race--some of the race films and like that, but I was like, "Oh, my God!"
Speaker 1: Now some of the race films such as--
Speaker 2: So I imagine--I'm not certain, but I would imagine it would be stuff like that was done by Oscar Michaeux.  I remember seeing black cowboys when I was little, so I imagine that it was--oh, God!  What was his name?
Speaker 1: Herb Jeffries.
Speaker 2: Herb--I imagine it was Herb Jeffries.  I imagine--I don't remember the name, but I remember distinctly seeing things like Hopalong Cassidy in the movie theater, but I also saw black cowboys.  So, I would imagine that the Bridges were importing Herb Jeffries and all of those, those films as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I was like, "Mama, I want to go where those people are," you know.  "I want to see that."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: "I want to do that."  You know, and she always said, "Baby, you can do whatever you want.  You know, you just have to study."
Speaker 1: This is what Mama Bertha [Winston's paternal aunt, Bertha Mae Winston Williams] said (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Mama Bertha always said, "Baby, you can do whatever you want, you just have to study."
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: You just have to get your education.
Story_ID: 316419
Speaker 1: I didn't like what I was experiencing and seeing in Mississippi.  I remember, for example, my mother [Winston's paternal aunt, Bertha Mae Winston Williams] took me to a parade downtown [in Greenville, Mississippi], and I don't remember how old I was, but I do remember this white guy standing next to me putting his hand under my dress.  And I was telling my mother, and there was nothing she could do.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.  So you wanted to get away from that?
Speaker 1: Absolutely.  I had to because, you know, just like I bit that policeman, I wanted to hit this man, and my mother knew that if I did, I could be really hurt.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: She was very much aware of where we lived, and she was very much aware of the circumstances.  So, I really think that when I finally said to her that I wanted to leave, she was happy.
Speaker 2: And how old were you then when you--
Speaker 1: The first time I left, I was thirteen, and I went to live with a cousin in New York [New York].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I stayed for a year, and I went to Catholic school [St. Bernard's School] in New York, and they thought that I'd have to be put back because I was from Mississippi, and, of course, as it turned out they tested me.  As it turned out, I was smarter than the kids that were in the class.  So, I stayed for year, then I went back to Mississippi.  And when I went back, mama wasn't doing so well so I wanted to stay with her.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So I stayed for a year and I really couldn't take it then because I had been in New York where I had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously)  You'd had a taste of honey.
Speaker 1: I had a taste of what freedom could be.  I had a taste of what it meant to have a--go to a real library.  I had a taste of what it meant to go and see a live performance that wasn't in a juke joint.  I had a taste of walking freely down the street.  I had a taste of--I had friends of all races in New York.  I had a taste of--
Speaker 2: But you're still a sub-teen at this time?
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I had at this school--and it's interesting because just a year ago, my daughter [Samantha Wheeler]--two years ago, my daughter went to school in New Jersey, and somehow my name came up for something, and one of my classmates from that one year of elementary school in New York found me--
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: --in New Jersey.  And I actually met with her and we chatted, and she said that even then I was always reaching for something else.  So I went--
Speaker 2: And you're back in Mississippi now?
Speaker 1: No, this is when I went to the elementary school in New York.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: So, the--one of the white girls from that elementary school, she saw me--my name in New Jersey and she looked me up and we got together.  But, I left that school, I went back to Mississippi for a year to be with mama 'cause she wasn't doing so well, and then I couldn't--I couldn't stand it.  So, I asked her if I could leave, and she knew that I wasn't coming back.  I mean, she knew it.  And she finally agreed that I could go, but it was really a funny story because at this time, I was dating this guy, seeing this guy, and he was much older than I was, and in a way I think my mother saw that as an opportunity for me, and this young man said he wanted to marry me.  I said, "Are you out of your mind?  I can't get married--."
Story_ID: 316420
Speaker 1: So it was then that I wrote to my biological father [Roosevelt Love Winston] and asked him if he would send for me, and he did.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I left.
Speaker 2: And you were how old?
Speaker 1: I was fifteen.
Speaker 2: Fifteen, and back to New York [New York]?
Speaker 1: Back to New York, 'cause I remember celebrating my--no, I was sixteen.  My sixteenth birthday in New York.  So when I went to New York, he at that time was living on the Lower East Side [New York, New York] and that was really strange for me 'cause I had never seen Hasidic Jews.  I had never seen the men with the curls and--.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --black and all of that.  But it was exhilarating as well, and he was married and he had a daughter, my half-sister, Diane [ph.], and--let's see, how old was she?  I think I was ten years older than her.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And it was not a very good experience.  I ended up leaving my father's house.
Speaker 2: How long did you stay?
Speaker 1: I stayed for a year.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I ended up leaving my father's house, and under very terrible circumstances, and I ended up--the city was gonna put me into the system.  My mother [Winston's paternal aunt, Bertha Mae Winston Williams] said, "Come home," come back to Mississippi and I didn't want to do that.  So, in school, I had made friends with this incredible, incredible family.  This girl was my best friend, and we attended Washington Irving High School [New York, New York], and I went to live with my cousin for a while and that was horrible, and I ended up living with this family.  So at the age of sixteen, I got another family (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, you went to New York at sixteen.  You really were there, so you--between sixteen and seventeen, right?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Good to know.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Good to know, and you were attending Washington Irving--
Speaker 1: Washington Irving High School.
Speaker 2: --no longer at a parochial school.
Speaker 1: No, I was in a public school which was something because--and at that time, it was an all-girls high school, but it was so liberating, because it was one of the best high schools in New York, and you could have--you could be on an academic track which I was, but there were also young ladies who decided they wanted to go into business, so you could be in the commercial track.  So at that time, this was before computers of course--so at this time, they were doing typing and steno [stenography] and learning everything about business, and some of those girls were in fact attending school like in the mornings and in the afternoons, they had jobs.  And then, there were also kids that had decided that they wanted to go into medicine.  This is in high school!  So, they were being geared toward, or steered rather toward medical studies.  It was an incredible place, and I'd gotten very much involved in the music program, in the drama program, I was in the choir, my girlfriend who became my sister [Adrianne Baughns-Wallace], we formed a little jazz group, and I was the singer and she was the pianist, and my other girlfriend, Janice [ph.], she played bass and another girlfriend played drums, and then we were in the choir, we put on plays, we were in the all-city--I was in the all-city chorus in New York.  I was--I was in--I was in a group called Comedie de Autres [ph.], which we did all kinds of--like the classical plays.  This was from my high school.  I got to travel throughout the city--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, doing all these things, and it was just--it was just liberating.  It was liberating, and as I matter of fact, when I left my father's house, the only place I felt safe that I could go was to school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So when I left my father's house, I went to school and told my teachers what had happened to me, and it was my teachers who called the police and a whole lot of drama, but the teachers there--see, I have been so blessed because I've had this village all around me all my life, and my teachers listened to me and they believed me, and it was from that school that I was able to leapfrog into the next phase of my life--
Story_ID: 316421
Speaker 1: As a matter of fact, when I was at that school [Washington Irving High School, New York, New York] and then I went to live with--went to live with my girlfriend's family--
Speaker 2: What was the girlfriend's--?
Speaker 1: Her name?  Oh, God!  I'm glad you asked.  Her name was Adrianne, A-D-R-I-A-N-N-E, Thomas.  Adrianne Thomas, then she got married, but her name is Adrianne Thomas-Wray, W-R-A-Y, and now her name is--her married name is Baughns, B-A-U-G-H-N-S, dash, Wallace, W-A-L-L-A-C-E [Adrianne Baughns-Wallace].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And it's interesting 'cause my (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You went to live with her family?
Speaker 1: I went to live with her family, and it was a funny story actually.  It's dramatic and all that, but it's really funny, because I went to their home.  The courts put me with my cousin again, and so I went to their--my cousin at that time had a drinking problem, and he could get very violent, so I left the house and it's New Year's Eve and I run out, and I'm on the street and I get a cab and I go to their house and there's no one home.  And I'm like what to do?  So, I just sat there in the hallway and waited for them to come home.  And so when they came home, they had been to like a family party or something, and they came home, and Viola [Viola Wray], who was Adrianne's mother, Viola, said, "Are you hurt?"  I said, "No ma'am."  "You're sure you're all right?"  I said, "Yes, ma'am."  She said, "Well, tell me tomorrow.  Come on in."
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And she said, "Come on in.  Go to bed.  Tell me tomorrow."  "You're not hurt?"  "No, ma'am," and she was a nurse.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, I went in and I went to bed, and of course, I told Adrianne what happened and da, da, da.  And so the next day they had like a family meeting, and they said, "Okay, tell us exactly what happened," and I did.  And so the family said, "Do you want to go back?"  And I said, "No."  And they said, "Okay, that's it.  So, let's go get your clothes," and that was it.  And from that moment on, I became a member of their family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And they got my clothes, and they kind of knew the circumstances because Adrianne and I were best friends and if you ever hear me talk about my sister, that's who I'm talking about.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And if you hear my daughter [Samantha Wheeler] talk about her Auntie A, that's who she's talking about.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: If you hear my daughter talk about Grandpa George [George Wray], it's Adrianne's father that she's talking about, because that's the only grandpa that she's ever known.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So that--then I became a member of their family, and then I got a new mother and a new father, and a new grandma and a new grandpa, and a new sister and a new brother.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It was--it's quite something.
Speaker 2: And you were still going to--
Speaker 1: I was going to high school at the time.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 1: And so, they lived in the projects and--
Speaker 2: What projects, where?
Speaker 1: Chelsea [Chelsea Houses; Chelsea-Elliot Houses, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Chelsea.
Speaker 1: Chelsea projects, and they--she was a practical nurse and--Viola was a practical nurse, and George worked for the transit authority [Metropolitan Transportation Authority].  He had been a chef, but he worked for the transit authority.  And so they really did not have a lot of money, and so when I was in high school, I got a job and started working, and they said to me, "You can stay here, we will feed you, and we'll do the best that we can."  And so I got a job in a--like a five and dime.  I remember it was Green's Department Store or something in New York [New York], and I would go to school, then I'd go to work after school.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so I earned money to buy clothes.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And they took care of me until I graduated from high school.
Story_ID: 316422
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-three [1963].
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-three [1963].
Speaker 2: Washington Irving [Washington Irving High School, New York, New York], and those same teachers that I talked about at Washington Irving, they arranged for me to have an audition for Howard University [Washington, D.C.] in the music department.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Who did--at Washington Irving?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They actually came to Washington Irving--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I sang for them, and I got a full scholarship to Howard.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A drama scholarship?
Speaker 2: No, it was a vocal scholarship.
Speaker 1: Vocal?  (Cough)  Excuse me.
Speaker 2: Voice scholarship actually they called it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it--I went there on full scholarship, and again because Viola and George [Winston's foster parents, Viola Wray and George Wray] didn't have a lot of money--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --they said, "We will do the best that we can to help you."  And so one of my teachers--I'm getting full now.  One of my teachers went to the Children's Aid Society in New York [New York] and filled out an application on my behalf, and for the time that I was at Howard University, every month the Children's Aid Society sent me an allowance, and that's how I could live.
Speaker 1: All right.  All right.  Okay.  Now so, therefore you are starting in September of '63 [1963], you're starting Howard University?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  At Howard.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  What was it like there?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Oh, God!  It was a new world for me.  I had been--I was the girl from Mississippi, I went to New York, I was living in the proj-, lived on the Lower East Side [New York, New York], and I was living in the projects [Chelsea Houses; Chelsea-Elliot Houses, New York, New York], and I get to Howard University.  I had never seen so many rich black people in my life.  I mean, there's this one girl on my floor--I'll never forget this, and when I tell this story, people think I'm making it up, but I'm not.  She arrived at school, and, of course, I'm in a room with two other girls.  [HistoryMaker] Jessye Norman is across the hall from me.  We were at Howard at the same time, right.  Jessye came from Georgia and so she's poor and I'm poor, and down the hall from us was a single room, and this girl came--her mother came and she came with an interior designer (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And she came with her housekeeper.  And so they came in (laughter), they measured the room, and they went out and they got carpets and they're painting, and this child came in with like three trunks of shoes, and I was like, "Oh, my God!"
Speaker 1: You had roommates?
Speaker 2: I had two roommates.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Don't ask me their names.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I'll be embarrassed.  But it was--it was quite something, and it was exhilarating, because I saw young people who were--first of all, I had never been around that many successful black people with the professors, and even though in Greenville [Mississippi], I--there were doctors and lawyers and all that, but I mean, these are people my age and it was just exciting, and it was also around the Civil Rights Movement time also.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] was on campus and, of course, there I was, about to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The March on Washington was coming up.
Speaker 2: Yes, it was, and there I was about to get killed, as my mother [Winston's paternal aunt, Bertha Mae Winston Williams] said (laughter), 'cause I was protesting everything, and wearing my hair natural and, you know, I was the little rebel.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It was quite something.
Speaker 1: The Civil Rights Movement was in full bloom.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, Civil Rights Movement was in full bloom.  I was discovering another part of myself intellectually.  I was in the music school, but I was a rebel because at that time, we could only study classical music, and I didn't get that.  I didn't understand that.  I didn't understand why we couldn't study the blues and jazz.
Story_ID: 316423
Speaker 1: You're there at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You're getting involved in so many activities.
Speaker 2: (Laughter)  Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: How are you doing in your studies?
Speaker 2: I'm doing fine.  I was--because of the scholarship, I had to maintain a certain average.  So, I was doing okay although I must say that even though I was there on a voice scholarship, I didn't have the same kind of musical background that most of the students had, so that I felt--sometimes I felt terribly inadequate.  So, I was fighting that battle.  I was really fighting the battle of trying to catch up musically, because most of these students had had music all of their lives.  You know, they'd started taking piano when they were very young, which was not the case with me.  And I loved music and I was pretty good, and I at that time, I wanted to be Leontyne Price.  So, I did okay, but I did get involved with part of the Civil Rights Movement.  I was--you know, I was out there protesting.  I was doing all sorts of things, and I loved it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, you came the summer of the March on Washington.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did you partake in that march (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  I didn't.  I didn't.
Speaker 1: No, ma'am?
Speaker 2: I didn't.  But I was there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was there in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] and it was electric.  It was electric, and I think the only reason that I didn't partake is that I didn't have a way of getting downtown.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was the only reason--the only reason, and after that, a lot of the students came together and they talked about what happened, and it just really kind of mobilized people, and I remember--I forgot what exactly was happening.  It was something happening in Baltimore [Maryland] and a group of us got together, and we weren't supposed to, but we did and, you know, we marched and all of that stuff.  So, it was just--it was a time of discovery, it was a time of pride, it was a time of energy.  It was an incredible time to be black and in America.  It was--I really felt that I had come into my own at that time.  I was at Howard, and I was only at Howard for a, a year because the next summer, I went back to New York [New York] and I started working again--
Story_ID: 316424
Speaker 1: And I met [HistoryMaker] Robert Hooks, and he had formed a group called the Group Theater Workshop, and I really had decided that if I was gonna go for this, I wanted to go for it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I felt that New York [New York] was the place to do it.  So, I came back and I got a job--another job.  I remember I started working at a bank, and then I got another job, and then the Group Theater Workshop happened, and then I became (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This is the summer of '64 [1964] now, right?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so we did different things with the Group Theater Workshop.  As a matter of fact, we would do productions, and Robert Hooks who founded the theater--the company, the Group Theater Workshop, he in fact lived around the corner from the projects where I was living, and he saw a lot of the young people in my neighborhood that were getting involved with drugs, and he decided he wanted to do something about that.  And he actually knocked down the walls in his apartment and built a stage in his apartment so that we could come over and study.  And he brought in all of his friends, [HistoryMaker] Douglas Turner Ward, [HistoryMaker] Barbara Ann Teer, Lonne Elder [Lonne Elder III], Adolph Caesar, Hal DeWindt.  I even think--I don't know if Billy [Billy Dee Williams] was there.  I don't think Billy Dee was there at the time, but--
Speaker 2: Michael Schultz [HistoryMaker Michael A. Schultz]?
Speaker 1: Michael Sch-, but Michael was later.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Michael was later.  But all these people came--this was in the training period.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Louis Johnson--
Speaker 2: Louis?
Speaker 1: --came to teach us movement and all of this, and it was free.  And at that--
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: It was free and at this time, he of course was this big TV star and he was also working for Joseph Papp at the New York Shakespeare Festival [New York, New York], and we put on programs for our parents and this one time like a year--I think it was like a year later, we put on a program for our parents, and Jerry Tallmer, I'll never forget, from the New York Post, came and saw us and he reviewed us, and he said, "These kids were incredible," and Joseph Papp came and saw us, and Joseph Papp hired us to tour.
Speaker 2: Now, they were watching you in this busted out wall apartment (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Exactly, and then what happened is we did that--
Speaker 2: --of Robert Hooks?  Bobby Dean?
Speaker 1: --we did it--Bobby Dean Hooks.  We did it at the apartment, and then Bobby was also doing a play, LeRoi Jones [Amiri Baraka], at that time, 'The Dutchman,' and he was doing this play at the Cherry Lane Theatre [New York, New York], off-Broadway.  So they let us use the theater to do a production on a Monday night, 'cause that was the dark night in the theater--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --to put on a production for our parents, and Barbara Anne Teer took Gwendolyn Brooks' poem, 'We Real Cool,' and developed it into a theatrical piece with Adolph Caesar and Lonne Elder and all that, but it's really Barbara who took this poem.  And so Jerry Tallmer reviewed us and wrote us up in The Post, and Joe Papp came and see it--to see us, and then he hired us to tour with the New York Shakespeare Mobile Theater.  We toured all around New York City, and Maxine Griffith was in that group, Antonio Fargas was in that group, myself, my sister, Adrianne [Adrianne Baughns-Wallace].  Adrianne--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --was in that group.  A lot of incredible--oh, Daphne Maxwell--[HistoryMaker] Daphne Maxwell Reid now.  She was in that group.  Oh, what was Tina's last name?  Tina Nurse.  A young lady by the name of Tina Nurse who went on to become an international model--a star of modeling--a star model.  Oh, Bostic, Bostic Van Felton, he was in that group.  Clayton [ph.] was in that group.  It was phenomenal.  Tony Hudson, who was a young man who was incredible, incredible, and unfortunately he was one of the sons that we lost to the drugs.  Oh, and the part I left out is when we lived in those projects [Chelsea Houses; Chelsea-Elliot Houses, New York, New York] (laughter), there's this girl that lived in the projects--lived in the apartment above us and she used to come down all the time, and I used to talk to her and she reminded me of this later on.  It was Whoopi, [HistoryMaker] Whoopi Goldberg.  She lived in the same projects upstairs, and she reminded me years later when I did a movie with her that I always would talk to her.  And so when I did this film, 'Clara's Heart' with her, she made sure that I was taken care of and all of that and she was like, "I used to love to come to your apartment when you lived there, and I used to watch the fish," and I was like, "Gosh, you really was there," 'cause she remembers the fish, you know.  But it's a small world--small world.
Story_ID: 316425
Speaker 1: But we did--we did that production, and then of course years later, I worked again at the Shakespeare Festival [New York Shakespeare Festival, New York, New York], and as a result of doing that piece with the Shakespeare Festival, a casting agent saw me and then invited me to audition for this play ['The Prodigal Son'] by Mr. Langston Hughes, and I auditioned for that and I got it, and Vinnette Carroll [Vinnette Justine Carroll] was the director.  And from that play, I got my Equity [Actors' Equity Association] card.  So now, I was officially--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --I was officially an actor!
Speaker 2: You're really bad now!
Speaker 1: Oh, God!  You couldn't tell me anything.  Couldn't tell me anything.  And met incredible--I've had incredible mentors in this industry.
Speaker 2: And don't skip over that part (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I, I--
Speaker 2: --of trying to get NEC [Negro Ensemble Company] off the ground.
Speaker 1: Oh, no!  I didn't even get there yet.
Speaker 2: Trying to find the money.  Okay.
Speaker 1: This was all prior to NEC.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Then, I went to work at Lincoln Center [Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, New York, New York].  They had an educational department at Lincoln Center where they would tour plays into the schools.  So, I worked in the office, part of the booking division.  So they thought I was crazy because I went to them and I said--they hired me, right?  And I said, "I need this job, but I can't type."  (Laughter) And so they said, "Okay."  I said, "But I'll learn!"  They're like, "Okay."  So, I ended up getting the job and I--and then I'm there for a while and I said, "Now look.  I need this job.  I want this job, but you have to understand, I'm an actor.  So, there'll be times when I need to take off," and they're looking at this kid like she's crazy, right.  I said, "But I'll--some days I may have to have my lunch at three o'clock 'cause then I have to go to an audition."  And they're like, "We don't believe this lady is saying this," right.  So, they were very tolerant, and they did allow me to go on these auditions and things, and also during that time, I had met Diana Sands--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and Diana Sands became a mentor to me, and then I became like her assistant, and then when any--see, at that time, Bobby Dean Hooks [HistoryMaker Robert Hooks]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and [HistoryMaker] Douglas Turner Ward and Gerald Krone, they were trying--oh, what happened is they produced--Bobby produced a play of Douglas Turner Ward's called 'Day of Absence and Happy Ending,' ['Happy Ending/Day of Absence,' Douglas Turner Ward] and he was like one of the first black producers to produce anything in New York City [New York, New York], and he raised the money and he did that.  And then out of that, another article was written about these black people that are doing these fabulous things.  Now also at that time, 'The Blacks[: A Clown Show,' Jean Genet] was running off-Broadway, so we were really starting to have our presence felt in and around New York City.  And so they were trying to raise this money to, to, to get these plays mounted, and Bobby ended up making friends with all these people.  As a matter of fact, when we were doing the Group Theater Workshop, it was because of his friends that he was able to run the Group Theater Workshop, because his friends would actually give money to keep us alive, and he ended up moving out of Chelsea [New York, New York] into a loft.  I believe it was 18th Street--18th or 19th Street and 6th Avenue, so that we could have a bigger place.  He didn't move there for himself, he moved there for us.
Speaker 2: For the group.
Speaker 1: For the group.  The group was expanding, and then he would go off and do his movies and he would leave me in charge.  So, I was kind of running things, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 316426
Speaker 1: He [HistoryMaker Robert Hooks] was always trying to raise money for us, and then one thing after another, he did 'Day of Absence/Happy Ending' ['Happy Ending/Day of Absence,' Douglas Turner Ward] and then out of that, there was an article that was written in The New York Times about us--no, about black theater, and then Doug [HistoryMaker Douglas Turner Ward] wrote an article ['American Theater: For Whites Only?' Douglas Turner Ward], and then the Ford Foundation [New York, New York] gave a grant, and if I remember correctly, it was $489,000 because that was a lot of money in the '60s [1960s], $489,000, that was a lot of money (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absolutely.  A ton of money.
Speaker 1: So they gave him that money to start the Negro Ensemble Company [NEC], and they thought long and hard about it, and they named the group the Negro Ensemble Company, and we caught a lot of hell for that because we were in the middle of the Black Power movement, and they didn't want to leave out anybody.
Speaker 2: I hear you.
Speaker 1: You know, so we became the Negro Ensemble Company, and it was to this day still the most incredible, theatrical experience of my life.  To be young, they called me the baby although Judyann Elder [Judyann Johnson Elder] and I fight about this all the time.  I was known as the youngest member of the group.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I was the only member from the Group Theater Workshop who was put into the professional company, and Judy and I fight over it.  She says, "I'm younger than you, so I was the youngest member," but that's debatable.  But anyway, but to be with not only Bobby Dean Hooks or Robert Hooks, as he's now known, and Douglas Turner Ward and Gerald Krone, and Gerald is not to be left out of the equation because he was the one that came in with all the business acumen.  And so he trained, and that that was part of NEC, you were always training someone to take your place.  You were always training, and it was truly a repertory company because we would be rehearsing one play in the morning and doing another one at night.  We were doing our classes.  We had movement classes, voice classes, acting classes, speech classes, karate classes, so that we would learn how to control our bodies and control our minds.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It was, we were in university, you know.  It was phenomenal.  And then to be as young as I was and to be there with Frances Foster and Esther Rolle and Moses Gunn and Adolph Caesar and Arthur French [HistoryMaker Arthur Wellesley French] and Bill Jay, and Clarice Taylor, and David Downing and Allie Woods and--I mean, please God, don't let me forget anybody.  Who, who--did I forget anybody?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.
Speaker 1: I don't think I did.
Speaker 2: I think you got 'em all.
Speaker 1: I think so.  Denise!  Denise!  Denise!
Speaker 2: Oh, right, right.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Denise Nicholas.
Speaker 2: Denise Nicholas.  Right.
Speaker 1: I mean to--and Rosalind Cash!
Speaker 2: And Rosalind.
Speaker 1: Rosalind Cash.  To be there with all of these people.  You cannot imagine what that felt like, being this little girl from Mississippi.  You know, I was in a professional company, and then just prior to that, I'd had the experience of being in a play ['The Prodigal Son'] by Langston Hughes and then to meet Mr. Hughes.  I was like, "Oh, my God!  I've died and gone to heaven," and I had!
Speaker 2: Well, you had created your own heaven.
Speaker 1: I, well--
Speaker 2: You had done a lot of work.
Speaker 1: --with the help of a lot of people.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It was--it was--it was incredible.
Story_ID: 316427
Speaker 1: It was incredible, and then as a result of that experience, to meet other people.  To meet [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte, whom as a little girl in Mississippi, you know, I had seen in 'Carmen Jones,' you know, or to meet Sidney Poitier and have them come to the theater, or to meet Miles Davis and, and have them come to the theater, and then to have them know my name.  You know, or to have them come up and say that they admired my work, and then to--it was a very generous time as well.  I think that's missing today.  By that I mean it was nothing for me to be in the presence of greatness.  It was nothing for me to be in the presence of Mr. Paul Robeson or James Baldwin or Diana Sands or Mr. Duke Ellington or any of these people.  To be in the presence of absolute greatness, and Brock Peters--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Sidney Poitier, Al Freeman, Jr.  All of the--Roxie Roker--all of these people, and to have them share with me any knowledge that they had.  Lou Gossett [HistoryMaker Louis Cameron Gossett, Jr.].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I used to sit and just listen to them talk, and it was like being--it was far more than I ever could've learned at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], and that's nothing against Howard.  I don't want you to misunderstand me, but to be--
Speaker 2: You were right in the thick of the dialogue.
Speaker 1: I was in it.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I was in it.  And at the time, I didn't realize that I was also creating it.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I didn't realize that.  It was an incredible movement--theater movement that was happening in New York [New York] at the time.  And then to be a part of NEC [Negro Ensemble Company], to represent the United States of America at the World Theatre Festival [World Theatre Season] in London [England].  Oh, my God!  The only theater company in the entire country that was chosen to represent the United States.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: Not black company (simultaneous)!
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You were there?
Speaker 1: The only theater company that was chosen at that time--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --to represent the United States and then to go to London, and the so-called great democracy, and be on stage, and we were doing a play that was very controversial, which Michael Schultz [HistoryMaker Michael A. Schultz] had directed, called 'Song of the Lusitanian Bogey,' written by a German writer believe it or not called Peter Weiss, W-E-I-S-S, and it was about colonialism in Angola, in Mozambique, and we were actually--our lives were threatened on the stage.  They were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) On the stage?
Speaker 1: On the stage.  They were throwing things at us on stage, telling us to get out of the stage, calling us nigger, calling us all kinds of name--these are the very educated Brits.  Oh, it was such an exciting time, to be there, and then to go--excuse me--and do my first concert in Rome [Italy] in front of thousands of people.  I thought I had gone to heaven.  It was so exciting.
Speaker 2: Now we're up to where?
Speaker 1: Oh, God (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Is it 19--
Speaker 1: This is about--oh this is like '69 [1969] I think--
Story_ID: 316428
Speaker 1: And then I decided again that I was getting too comfortable at NEC [Negro Ensemble Company]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --because I had a job, and I knew that I was gonna be doing another play, then anoth- but I was getting comfortable, and I decided it was time to leave.  And then I went and I did a play at the New York Shakespeare Festival [New York, New York], and then after that, I think I did another play at the Truck and Warehouse Theater [New York, New York] called 'Billy Noname' [Johnny Brandon and William Wellington Mackey], called 'Billy Noname.'
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Then after that I did another play off-Broadway at the Orpheum Theatre [New York, New York] called 'The Me Nobody Knows,' and they took that play and that became my first Broadway show--
Speaker 2: Wow!
Speaker 1: --'cause they transferred it from the Orpheum Theatre to the Broadway stage.  So now, I was on Broadway.  Now, I was this little girl from Greenville, Mississippi starring in a Broadway show.  It was--it was something.  And then, it was also bittersweet because I had been running for a while and that was the year that daddy died.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Lewis [Winston's paternal uncle, Lewis Pampley].
Speaker 2: Lewis.  That's where--
Speaker 1: So, yeah.  So it was--.
Speaker 2: But mama, Aunt Bertha [Bertha Mae Winston Williams]--
Speaker 1: Mom was still--Mom was still alive.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So that was--it was bittersweet.  But he was very proud of me.
Speaker 2: Did he ever get up to see you?
Speaker 1: He never got a chance to see me.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But he got a chance to see all the Playbills and all the--and every time I--every time I would take a new picture, you know, I'd send him a picture and stuff, and so my pictures were everywhere and everybody that he came in contact with, they got to see the pictures and they got to see the shows I was doing--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and he'd be bragging and all of that.  So, that was good.
Story_ID: 316429
Speaker 1: After 'The Me Nobody Knows,' I think I did 'Hair' for a while, and then I started doing a TV show called 'The Electric Company' which was the--
Speaker 2: PBS [Public Broadcasting Service] show.
Speaker 1: Yes.  So I did that with Morgan Freeman, and actually replaced Lee Chamberlin on that show.  So it was Morgan Freeman, Skip Hinnant, Rita Moreno, Jim Boyd, Judy Graubart, Luis Avalos, and myself, and then there were four younger--four young kids, and I can't--except for one I can't remember their names right now.  June Angela, I think was her name.  But the other kid--oh!  Irene Cara.
Speaker 2: Wow!
Speaker 1: Irene Cara was in 'The Me Nobody Knows' with me, and then she was also in 'The Electric Company' with me.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, Morgan Freeman, and Morgan is still a friend of mine.  As a matter of fact, Harold [HistoryMaker Harold Wheeler] and I went down--you know, he's moved back to Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Right.  Yeah, I still keep in touch.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So we went down for his--this is two years now.  Went down for his sixty-fifth birthday celebration, and Harold just came back from Mississippi.
Speaker 2: Monday?
Speaker 1: Monday, and Morgan was there hosting this telethon down there.  So, it's been--and then, of course, other shows--and they've been very diverse.  I re- Oh, I did--then I met Harold again when I did another show on Broadway called 'Two Gentlemen of Verona.'  Again, I came in and I replaced Jonelle Allen in that piece, and Harold and I met again and then we started dating, and here we are twenty-seven years later.
Speaker 2: Well, this is just a small part of your career now.  I mean, you're doing very well on Broadway, some television parts (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 2: --some parts are beginning to be offered.
Speaker 1: And also, also at this time, I had started another career.  I had started doing commercials and I had started doing voiceover work.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And on-camera comm- work, and as a matter of fact, the very first commercial that I did, which reminded me so much of Mississippi was for Zest soap, and I actually received all kinds of hate mail, because I was wearing my hair natural at that time, and I'll never forget the copy said, "I'm going to take a shower and I bet I'll be cleaner than you are."  So I got all this hate mail from all these prejudice people in the South saying, "How dare you have this nigger come on camera saying on my TV telling me she's gonna be cleaner than me."  People are ignorant.
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: So, I had started doing on-camera work, and Adolph Caesar actually introduced me to his voiceover agency, and he suggested that I look into the possibility of doing voiceover work.  And as a matter of fact, he became my teacher in, you know, different character voices and just teaching me the business of that, and so I was doing really very, very well in voiceover areas.  Great story.  I used to do the voices for example of Jamaica tourism, and I used to do the voiceovers for the Bahamas and, you know, McDonald's and Burger King and all those--all those commercials, and there was (laughter)--there was an airline that was looking for a voice, and so they had--and you would send in your tape, and it was down to two people, myself and one other person.  So they flew in from Texas 'cause the ad agency was in Texas and they were gonna do what they called demos.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so knowing the business, I got all dressed up when normally I'd show up in my jeans or whatever.  I got all dressed up, I went in and the other lady was there first, and so she was finishing and it was my time and I went in and they say, "Yes, can we help you?"  And I said, "I believe I have a session."  And they said, "What?"  And I said, "My name is [HistoryMaker] Hattie Winston."  "Oh."  They didn't know that I was black.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And they found it very difficult to talk to me the whole session.  They wouldn't tell me what they wanted, they da-da, da-da, da-da.  And I had--I was doing a lot of voiceovers at the time and so I knew the engineer, and so while they were in there talking about me, he pushed the talkback button so I could hear what they were saying.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And they were saying things like, "Well, she's really good.  She really knows what she's doing."  And so I was just in there waiting and finally I said, "Is there anything else you'd like to say?"  And long story short, I ended up getting the job.
Speaker 2: All right!
Speaker 1: So, I became the voice for American Airlines.
Story_ID: 317684
Speaker 1: So, now you are running roughshod over everybody there in the ad agencies.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, it was--it was very interesting to me because if someone tells me I can't do something, that just motivates me to do it.  And as I said Adolph [Adolph Caesar] had told me that he thought that I could make a very good living doing voiceovers, and he was certainly one of the pioneers for African Americans doing trailers for films and doing--I mean, he was phenomenal.  And for him to have that kind of confidence in me, I felt I should at least try.  So, I did and I got different accounts.  Of course I did, you know, black accounts, but I wanted to do what they called generic accounts, and there were many times when people would not see me.  They would not listen to my tape, and so one of the things I did was I told my agent to take my picture off my tapes.  I put a lion on instead--I mean a tiger on instead--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know, and my name, 'cause I was going to be ferocious I felt in pursuing this.  And the way I think--the way I got the American Airlines account was because my picture was not on there.  And when I walked in, they really did expect me to be white.  And then as it turned out, once I got in there--which was all any of us ever want, I did--I've never wanted anybody to give me anything.  All I want you to do is give me the opportunity.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And it's just like I said, "I want to spend myself."  That's how I've lived my life, you know, "I want to spend myself," doing everything that I do so that it's okay if I fall down.  It's okay if I fail, but at least let me fail after I get a chance to try.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Don't let me (simultaneous) --
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Give me the opportunity to fail.
Speaker 2: Give me the opportunity.  I don't want you to give me anything but the opportunity.  So, you know, I went in there and I got the job.  I went to so many and I didn't get the job.  I went to so many ad agencies in New York [New York] and they wouldn't even see me.  But I wouldn't give up.
Speaker 1: Good.  Good for you.
Speaker 2: I wouldn't give up.
Speaker 1: Good for you.
Speaker 2: I would not give up.  And I, you know, it's interesting 'cause, my God, how long have I been doing this?  Ooh!
Speaker 1: Well, you're saying now we're in approximately 1972?  Have we?
Speaker 2: No, we've passed '72 [1972] now.
Speaker 1: Seventy-two [1972].  Okay.
Speaker 2: We've passed '72 [1972] 'cause I did 'Verona' ['Two Gentlemen of Verona']--I ended Verona in '72 [1972].  So, I was doing voiceovers back then.  Yeah, I was doing in '72 [1972] and this is what, 2005?  So what is that?  Three--that's like thirty--
Speaker 1: That's twenty-eight--thirty-three years.
Speaker 2: Thirty-three years, you know, and if you really think about as far as acting is, I've been doing this like forty years.  That's a long time.
Speaker 1: That's a long time.
Story_ID: 317685
Speaker 1: But you've had a few television hits in there.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: You want to talk about it?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes!  (Laughter) Well, I did, as I said, I did 'The Electric Company.'
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And then I did a series in New York [New York] called 'Nurse,' and I did that with Michael Learned and Robert Reed.  And we were only on for two seasons, but it was interesting and innovative because we shot it in New York, and that was a time when series were not being shot in New York.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So I did that and that was--Michael Learned, just an incredible actress and an incredible human being, and I still see her to this day.  And this was back in the '80s [1980s] when we did that.  Then I did--the reason I ended up in, in Los Angeles [California] was I came out here to do a series called 'Homefront,' and I did that with Dick Anthony Williams and Mimi Kennedy.  Oh, my Lord, Jesus!  I'm having a mental moment.  But anyway, incredible actors on that show.  Kyle Chandler, Wendy Phillips--it's coming back.  (Laughter) Great, great actors and the producers of that show, Lynn Latham [Lynn Marie Latham] and Bernie Lechowick [Bernard Lechowick], I can really say that they are my friends to this day.  They are my friends.  But I ended up--I came to California to do that series, and my family relocated to California as a result of that series.  Also, you know, I've had the opportunity to do--I just finished doing 'Becker' with Ted Danson, and we did that for six seasons.  So that's quite phenomenal, and right now it's in syndication which is really very lovely.  And then in between that, I've done other plays, I've done films.  I did 'Jackie Brown' with Samuel Jackson [Samuel L. Jackson] and Robert De Niro, Quentin Tarantino.  I did a movie called 'True Crime' with Clint Eastwood, Isaiah Washington, and--I'm having a moment here, but that was incredible, to work with Clint Eastwood.  It's just been--I did a thing called 'Project Greenlight' on HBO which Ben Affleck and Matt Damon produced.  The movie that came out of that was called 'Shaker Heights' ['The Battle of Shaker Heights'].  That was great.  I did a movie with [HistoryMaker] Whoopi Goldberg called 'Clara's Heart.'
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, Whoopi was in that and Beverly Todd was starring in that as well.
Story_ID: 317686
Speaker 1: I've recorded, I've done my nightclub acts.  I've actually done a nightclub act around the world.
Speaker 2: Have--are you still travelling?
Speaker 1: We've been doing it out here in Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We did it, and by we, I mean Harold [HistoryMaker Harold Wheeler] and me, and when I do the nightclub act, he plays piano and he does all the orchestrations for it, so I'm very lucky.
Speaker 2: Very comfortable.
Speaker 1: Very comfortable with that--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and very fortunate that he's--you know, that he's doing it.  So, we still do that.  I'm involved with my children's groups.
Speaker 2: How about as a civil--civic activist?
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.  Well, you know, I at one point--I'm not now, but at one point, I was actually for AFTRA [American Federation of Television and Radio Artists; Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA)].  I was the coast [West Coast] chair of the CEO committee at AFTRA.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I work with an organization now called Break the Cycle, and it's about young people and violence, and we do it teaching them the legal aspects of violence--kids that come out of violent households.  They may not know what their legal possibilities are, so we try to help them with that.  I'm involved with a--I was talking earlier about Hollywood Sisters, which is an organization that was founded by Beverly Todd and Judy Pace [HistoryMaker Judy Pace-Flood].  And what that's about is we try and train young--particularly young females, African American females, that are coming into the business, and we try to help them up with mentors so that they can learn what the business is all about.  You know, with various museums, I'm involved with a group that I founded called Onyx Village, and we teach African American children their history through cultural activities.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I started another group like that in New York [New York] called Heritage Kids which, with the same purpose.  I'm involved with a group out here now called Classic and Contemporary American Plays, CCAP, and what we do is we do readings of plays, some of which I've directed, and we take the so-called classics and we make them multicultural, and we put on these professional, professional plays.
Story_ID: 317687
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I recently did a play that I'm very proud of, it's called 'The Slave Narratives' ['The Slave Narratives: A Mighty, Mighty People'] based upon the slave narratives, and I spent like a year reading the narratives from the Smithsonian [Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.] and I took these narratives and put them in form where there was a through line, and I used the voices of the slaves and I put together a play with music.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I added (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, Alfre Woodard was--
Speaker 1: No, Alfre wasn't in that one.
Speaker 2: That was a different one.
Speaker 1: No, that's a different one.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's one that they did for TV, and these are totally different narratives, and we did it on stage.  And I did--
Speaker 2: Were you doing it for the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 1: Unh-uh.
Speaker 2: No, that was--okay.
Speaker 1: I just did it.  My first production of it was at the Denver Center for the Performing Arts in Denver, Colorado, and we're gonna to do it again out here in Los Angeles [California].  But in that piece, I had [HistoryMaker] James Avery, Michele Shay, Marlene Warfield.  Do you remember Marlene from 'The Great White Hope'?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes!  Yes!
Speaker 1: Marlene Warfield.  Lord have mercy!  Kim Staunton, Candy Brown, John Wesley, [HistoryMaker] Charles Weldon, and Terrence Raglan [ph.], myself, and I had twelve singers.  There's a group in Denver called the Spirituals Project out of Denver University [University of Denver, Denver, Colorado], and their intent is to preserve the culture of spirituals.  So, I hired them to be a part of my production and it was--it was really, really exciting, and it's called 'The Slave Narratives: A Mighty, Mighty People.'
Story_ID: 317688
Speaker 1: What would you like your legacy to be?  What would you like best to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as a woman who never gave up.  I would like to be remembered as a good mother, a good wife, and a good friend.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Is there anything that we may have left out of the interview?
Speaker 2: Oh, God!  We covered a lot.
Speaker 1: You've covered a lot.
Speaker 2: I'm looking forward to the rest of the journey.
Speaker 1: All right.  I like that.  I like that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I really am.  It's been an incredible ride and I'm looking forward to the rest of it.
Story_ID: 317689
Speaker 1: And, ready.
Speaker 2: Well, that's Hattie Mae Winston [HistoryMaker Hattie Winston] in her very TV series movie pose (laughter).
Speaker 1: And about when was that picture taken?
Speaker 2: Oh, that was taken 2000--what is this, '02 [2002]?  This is '05 [2005], so that was taken like 2003.
Speaker 1: Oh, my goodness!  This is the second Broadway show that Hattie Winston every--ever did.  This is from 'Two Gentlemen of Verona,' and this is very significant because this is where she reconnected with the man who was to become her future husband.
Speaker 2: All right!
Speaker 1: (Laughter)  [HistoryMaker] Harold Wheeler.  Okay.
Speaker 2: All right.  Okay.
Speaker 1: This is the TV series that I've just finished.  We did this show for six years.  The show's called 'Becker,' and it is now in syndication.  And we have Ted Danson--oh, I'll start with the left.  That's me, Hattie Winston, across the front next to me is Ted Danson, and that is Nancy Travis, and in the back on the left, that's Shawnee Smith, Saverio Guerra, and Alex Desert.  It was one of the best experiences of my life.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of Hattie Winston, that would be me, with [HistoryMaker] Whoopi Goldberg, a film that we did called 'Clara's Heart,' and this one is very significant to me because Whoopi and I grew up in the same projects [Chelsea Houses; Chelsea-Elliot Houses, New York, New York] together, and then when I went to do this film, she was starring in this film and she just was so gracious and took such good care of me.
Speaker 1: Ah, yes!  This is from the early days of NEC, the Negro Ensemble Company.  This is a show called 'Daddy Goodness,' and that is me on the right-hand side sitting down looking very young, which I was (laughter), and David Downing in the middle, and Bebe Drake-Hooks [Bebe Drake] on the left.  This is the show that actually brought me to California.
Speaker 2: This is a TV series called 'Homefront,' and that is me with my family, the Davises, on the ABC show.  That is my son in front, played by Sterling Macer, Jr. and my husband in back, played by Dick Anthony Williams.
Speaker 1: Ah, yes!  This is me when I was thirteen years old in Mississippi.
Speaker 2: And this is a recent shot of me in one of my contemplative moods.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Just for this one.
Speaker 2: And this is George [George Wray] and Viola Wray, that's W-R-A-Y, when I was sixteen years old.  This is the family that took me into their home and they became my parents.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That is mama, or Mama Bertha, or Aunt Bertha [Bertha Mae Winston Williams], or just plain mama, and me, and I believe I was about fi- I think I was four or five years old in that picture.
Speaker 2: That's you.
Speaker 1: But doesn't she look very regal and elegant?  And this is Hattie Winston when she decided that she was really gonna be a movie star, (laughter) and I'm very proud of this picture as a matter of fact because this is taken by Bert Andrews, and Bert Andrews was one of our premiere theatre photographers in New York [New York].
Speaker 2: Believe it or not, this is my high school [Washington Irving High School, New York, New York] graduation picture.  Oh, I was so excited!  That's my high school graduation picture.  I was eighteen years old, saying "Look out world, here I come."
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.  And that's mama.  Bertha.  Mama, and she was--I'm not exactly sure how old she was in this picture, but I'm guessing that she was about--what would you say--about five?  No?
Speaker 2: A little older maybe.
Speaker 1: Little old--Let's say seven.  She was about seven years old, and I just love this picture of her.
Speaker 2: Oh!  Now.  This is Hattie Winston in her [HistoryMaker] Eartha Kitt pose.  (Laughter) This is her come to me.  This is her singing character that she created.  This is her nightclub character.
Speaker 1: Aww!  That's my baby.  That is Samantha Diana Wheeler, and she is graduating from college in this photo, and education has been so important to this family and now she's working on her master's degree.
Speaker 2: And this is another part of my family.  I spoke earlier about my sister and my brother.  In this photo to the left you have my husband, Harold Wheeler, Hattie Winston in the red, and that is Clyde Ashland Wray to my left and Adrianne Baughns-Wallace to my right.  That is my sister and my brother.
