1:10:15    Cynthia (Cindy) Matthews was born in 1955 in Epps, Louisiana. Her father was a farmer and her mother was a schoolteacher. In Epps, she remembers that black and white people got along and worked together. Her family was Southern Baptist and she grew up in the church. She discusses her education growing up, including her mother teaching in a school where race riots broke out. Her family sent her to a Southern Baptist boarding school in south Louisiana for high school. Many of her classmates were the children of missionaries who lived all around the world. She attended Northeast Louisiana University in Monroe where she studied nursing and met her first husband. They moved to Henderson, Texas after graduating. They became youth directors at a small Baptist church, and eventually learned about Jerry Falwell and Liberty Bible College in Lynchburg, Va. from some friends. Her husband decided he wanted to attend seminary at Liberty Bible College, and they moved to Lynchburg, Virginia. She discusses the impact Jerry Falwell had on her and her husband. She tells about her own Christian identity and her personal beliefs. Social issues such as abortion access, homosexuality, and the removal of prayer from public schools helped shape their beliefs as well. After her husband graduated from Liberty, they left to go to Minneapolis, Minn. to start a church in the late 1970s. They were part of a movement that Falwell led to start churches all over the country and influence the culture. Two years after she moved to Minneapolis, her husband died in a car accident. She decided to move back to Lynchburg and reconnect with the community. She eventually meets and marries someone else, and they move to Richmond, Va. She worked as an executive assistant and marketer with her husband&#8217;s company in Richmond for a number of years. She discusses how she came to work at the Liberty University School of Law, where she assists Dean Matthew Staver. Finally, she discusses her views on feminism to close the interview.

She assists Dean Matt Staver in all matters of business related to the Law School. She was born in 1955 and was raised in a small farming community called Epps, Louisiana. She grew up in church, following the example of her parents. In high school she attended a Southern Baptist boarding school in south Louisiana. She attended Northeast Louisiana University, now known as the University of Louisiana at Monroe. She met her first husband in college, and after graduating they moved to Henderson, Texas for him to practice pharmacy.

70:13  START OF INTERVIEW
Evan Faulkenbury: Today is June 12, 2014. My name is Evan Faulkenbury and I&#8217;m here at the Liberty University School of Law in Lynchburg, Virginia where I&#8217;m interviewing Cindy Matthews about her life history. So, the first question I have to ask is to describe your birth and your childhood and growing up.
Cynthia Matthews: Okay. Well I was born July 6, 1955 &#8211; I was a Baby Boomer &#8211; in a little cotton patch town called Epps, Louisiana. It has one traffic light. [Laughs] It did in 1955 and still does today. My dad was a farmer, my mom was a schoolteacher, and I have two younger siblings. It was a little community where my dad grew up and where his grandparents grew up. I actually lived there through most&#8211;. Well, I&#8217;ll get to that in a moment, the change that happened. But it was the typical little small farm community in the Deep South.         My neighbors down the road from me were my elementary school teachers as well as the Sunday school teachers [Laughs] that I would have at church. So it was a small community. We did everything together: we went to school together, we went to church together, and we had little small-town celebrations and weddings and funerals, and it was the typical little small town. As well as, I&#8217;m sure will play into this, during the late [19]50s, early [19]60s, in farming in the small town, I grew up with a maid, and everyone around, all my friends, had maids. It is not perhaps what you might envision of a maid, but she was part of our family. Like I say, my mom taught school, my dad farmed, and Ethel was our caretaker when my mom was not there. My grandparents too had&#8211;. Actually that whole family lived on their property, on their large farm, so it was a way of life for us.         At the time when I was in elementary school the schools were segregated and it was not until I was in about the sixth or seventh grade that we walked through that segregation change in the schools and society. But for me, in the community that I lived in, that was actually not a real big deal because black and white were very well blended in that little town. We had to be. We had to support one another and help one another. So for me that piece of my growing up period was a very sweet time, and one that I now tell my children and my grandchildren about, which seems very foreign to them.          EF: I&#8217;m sure.
CM: They would see movies perhaps where there were different sections on a bus or different sections in a restaurant or something like that, and we did not have that there.
EF: Well tell me a bit more about &#8211; her name was Ethel?
CM: Yes.
EF: Tell me a bit more about her and the relationship that you and her had.
CM: Because I was the oldest I carried more responsibilities there at home, and of course during the summer when the garden season our produce would come in, and of course I grew up learning how to process the fruits and vegetables that came in. She taught me a lot. Of course my mother knew that as well, but she probably had as much influence on my training as far as learning how to process fruits and vegetables in the kitchen during the summertime as my own mom did. We would sit out in the yard, swing under the shade tree, and she would tell us stories. And we would drive to town and we would do shopping together. My dad had a couple of surgeries when I was still in elementary school so my mom would need to stay at the hospital with him, so Ethel stayed with us twenty-four-seven during those surgeries that he had. She did not drive so that was a little bit of an issue there where our relatives would have to come, but she would ride to school with us and make sure we were taken care of and got us back home.
EF: Okay. Well, tell me a bit more about your mother and your father and what their influences on you were like.
CM: Okay. Well&#8211;.
EF: Grandparents perhaps as well too.
CM: Well my dad&#8217;s father passed away when he was very young, but he continued to live with his mother and grandmother, and there were some other aunts and uncles that lived in this big house at different times.
EF: Right, a lot of extended family?
CM: Yes, on the large farm, and it was the same thing: cotton and soybeans, right on the bank of what was the [Bayou Macon] which was a tributary to the Mississippi River. So we&#8217;re all in that Mississippi Delta farmland. That was a part of our lives, right there close-knit family. My mom&#8217;s parents, however, lived about forty miles away in another smaller town. They too were farmers but my grandfather was a dairy farmer and then he leased out his farmland for cotton and soybeans and things like that.         Both sets of grandparents and extended families were very close. Holidays, Easter, Fourth of July, it was the typical thing that you would see in any movies, the large farms with the picnic tables and the red and white checkered tablecloths with watermelon and homemade ice cream and cousins running around. So that&#8217;s what I grew up with and it very much shaped who I am today as far as the close family unit that I&#8217;ve instilled in my own children. Actually on my mother&#8217;s side her grandparents lived on the connecting farm, which would have been my great-grandparents, and in that home was a great-great-grandmother.
EF: Oh, wow. [Laughs]
CM: So there are pictures of me, in my early years, of actually the five generations,&#8211;
EF: Wow.
CM: &#8211;which is very rare.
EF: That&#8217;s special.
CM: It is, and it&#8217;s on that side of the family that has the direct relationship to Robert E. Lee. My great-grandmother was a Lee, so they would sit around and have the different Civil War items sitting around that had actually been dug and hidden on the farms there during the Civil War&#8211;
EF: Oh, wow.
CM: &#8211;and they had unearthed them, and would tell stories that they had heard as children about when Robert came through &#8211; to them it was &#8220;Robert.&#8221;
EF: Right. Wow. [Laughs]
CM: Yep.
EF: So you&#8217;re also a descendant.
CM: Yeah, so I&#8217;m deep in Southern roots from there.
EF: That&#8217;s fascinating.
CM: Yeah.
EF: Well, tell me a bit about growing up in this small-town community, tell me a bit about the schools you went to and your education.
CM: Okay, I will, and I&#8217;ll also springboard into more of my mom and dad too. I got a little bit sidetracked there from the grandparents.
EF: Yeah, tell me more about them.
CM: Both sets of great-grandparents, grandparents, and then my parents were very strong believers. They then were Southern Baptists. It was Southern Baptists or the United Methodist Church. I think that was basically what was there in those small farming communities. So my faith in the Lord was grounded very young in my life and, like I say, they were all community-minded as far as church, school, and work.
EF: Right.
CM: So, with that said, my mom and dad were very much involved with the smaller Southern Baptist church there in my community. In fact my dad&#8217;s grandfather, which would be my great-grandfather, actually founded that little Southern Baptist church. He was a circuit-riding preacher and when my dad was young he can remember his grandfather getting on a horse with a saddlebag, and he would be gone for two or three weeks.
EF: Wow. So he was like a traveling evangelist.
CM: Yes.
EF: On a buggy.
CM: Yes, he was.
EF: Wow.
CM: So he was a circuit-riding preacher, his last name was Newton, and there is a little bit about him but not a whole lot in history archives. But he did found that little small community church, which is really what my dad grew up in.
EF: What was the name of the church?
CM: The church is Epps, E-p-p-s, Epps Baptist Church right there in that little community. It used to be called Floyd, F-l-o-y-d, and that&#8217;s what is really listed in more history books.
EF: Oh, I see.
CM: But Epps was the name of a man who came in with the railroad and established this little community so they changed the community name to Epps. But anyway, so that&#8217;s where that is, so naturally I grew up in that little church.
EF: Sure.
CM: From there, which will make a little interesting segue to this piece, is that I mentioned that along about the sixth or seventh grade for me is when the integration part within the schools started. My mom was a schoolteacher in a different school than I attended. It was in an adjoining community. However her community did not make that transition as smoothly as the school system I was in. There were riots and&#8211;.
EF: Was she at a high school?
CM: She was at&#8211;. Well there in the small communities it was elementary through high school.
EF: Oh, yeah. Sure.
CM: And it was in a different parish.
EF: I see.
CM: It was about twenty miles from my home, and honestly I don&#8217;t remember all the reasons for it but it was quite disruptive and our family car was shot at, the tires slit during school. It was a lot of unrest. Then my dad started receiving threatening phone calls about me. I was at the other school in that seventh, eighth, ninth grade timeframe. As a result of that they felt that it was best for me, because they were linking me at one school with my mom at another school, and felt like it was best for me to go to a boarding school.         It was a Southern Baptist boarding school in south Louisiana. It was called Acadia Baptist Academy, and that little school had been established in the early [19]40s by the Southern Baptist Convention for missionary children. For missionaries who did not have adequate education for their children, they would send them to this high school. It was a boarding school. But in the mid-[19]60s they had opened it up to other kids to come in as well. That fit the need for me. So I actually went to boarding school in high school there, which helped, again, shape who I am because not only was it a Christian base but there were kids there from all over the world, and I really enjoyed learning about different nationalities and different cultures. So when I would go home for holidays and stuff I was taking three or four different kids, missionary kids, and not only missionary kids. For instance, a missionary family in Honduras sent several children from their community to this good high school, so there was a blend. One of my closest, dearest friends was Mohammed from Yima, and he went on to medical school in London.
EF: Oh, wow.
CM: Yeah, things like that. We had some girls from Burma &#8211; which was old Burma &#8211; and Honduras, and a really nice blend.
EF: That&#8217;s fascinating.
CM: Yeah, so that was my high school.
EF: So at this high school, what was a typical day-in-the-life there, at a Southern Baptist boarding school in south Louisiana?
CM: Well, it was set in the middle of rice fields because south Louisiana, that particular area, grew &#8211; and still does to this day as far as I know &#8211; a lot of rice, and crawfish.
EF: Oh, right.
CM: But it was a typical day of getting up. Because I attended a Southern Baptist church I qualified for a work study. I was a hall monitor or a RA type of thing with that, the last three years I was there. My freshman year I didn&#8217;t but my sophomore through senior year was there. Yep, you would get up, you&#8217;d go to the cafeteria, eat breakfast, then you&#8217;d head on to class, which was across the street. I was a cheerleader for three years. For my junior and senior years I was vice president of the student government association. Then I also was involved with the music team. I played piano and I traveled with them. So it was typical small high school activities. Dinner was served. There was quiet time. Then we had quiet time which was for homework or you could go across the street to the school library, things like that. On weekends I was involved with a lot of school activities, whether it was SGA or with basketball. We only had basketball at that smaller school, so as a cheerleader we traveled to do that. Then the school itself, the SGA sponsored different functions and events, fun things to do on the weekends and stuff like that.
EF: That&#8217;s fascinating.
CM: Yeah, it was. Then, which would have been in the late [19]60s, early [19]70s, outside of perhaps your East Coast, Ivy League prep schools and things like that, there were not many boarding schools.
EF: I was going to say. I haven&#8217;t really heard of very many, or many experiences, so it&#8217;s unique.
CM: My home church helped to sponsor me and then I worked, as such, as a hall monitor and had responsibilities with that. I did room checks at night and had different leadership meetings and things like that. So, yeah, that&#8217;s what it was. I&#8217;d only go home on holidays or breaks and things like that.
EF: So if I remember right from reading your profile on the web page, you went to college at &#8211; was it Northeast Louisiana?
CM: Then it was called Northeast. Now it&#8217;s called University of Louisiana at Monroe.
EF: Oh, I see.
CM: They changed all of those. You&#8217;ve got different ones in Lafayette, Shreveport, things like that, but it was called Northeast Louisiana University. It was about an hour&#8217;s drive from my little community there in Epps and I went to the school of nursing there. That was actually where my mom went to school.
EF: Okay.
CM: It was nearby. I attended Northeast for different functions throughout the high school times as well, as far as different events or science fairs. I entered science fairs4-Hand stuff like that. So I was somewhat familiar with that campus, and I wanted to be a little bit closer to home.
EF: Sure.
CM: So that was my purpose of going there, and it was actually where I met my first husband, Joe Birdwell. He was in pharmacy school and we dated.
EF: And you were in nursing school?
CM: I was in nursing school, yeah. We did blood drives together. I mean, how romantic is that, you know?
EF: [Laughs] Sure.
CM: And did flip cards on studying pharmacology or something. But, yeah, we did that, we married, and moved to a little town. He was from Arkansas but he really wanted to practice pharmacy in Texas, so he was able to get a job right out of college in a little town called Henderson, Texas, northeast Texas, right between Longview and Tyler, Texas, in that little wedge there. So we married and moved off to Henderson, Texas to live happily ever after there, and really enjoyed that. He was there for about four years, worked as a pharmacist.
EF: What did you do during this time?
CM: Actually I continued on with some nursing schooling and then ended up&#8211;. He and I became youth directors at this small Baptist church.        EF: Oh, really?        CM: Mm hmm &#8211; there, and it was through that that we were introduced to Jerry Falwell.        EF: Oh, okay.        CM: This is now about 1975-1976. It was through this small church that we met a real precious couple, Bill and Janelle Sitton, and they were older. In fact they had children my age &#8211; a son my age who was away at college &#8211; and they became like mentors to Joe and I. We would go over to their home on Sunday evening and have dinner and would sit and watch Jerry Falwell.         EF: Okay.        CM: And it was through that, and a few other events that happened at our church along the way, that Joe felt the call to seminary, not knowing if that meant becoming a pastor or if it meant taking our medical training and going overseas as missionaries. We weren&#8217;t sure at that time but we knew that we had a special calling to go deeper with the Lord, to do something special for him. So he ended up applying to seminary, the seminary was new, and I should have had those dates for you. I don&#8217;t remember if it was two years old or three years old, but it was rather young. It was meeting downtown. Of course then it was Liberty Bible College and they had just started the seminary and Liberty classes were meeting at the old TRBC.        EF: Right, the old Thomas Road building.        CM: The old Thomas Road.        EF: The original building, I suppose.        CM: Yes, that is correct, but the seminary had a building all its own downtown, a couple blocks from the hotel where most of the students were housed at that time. So he was accepted to seminary.        EF: So you were living in Henderson and&#8211;        CM: Texas.        EF: &#8211;then he applied to come here to Lynchburg.        CM: Yep.        EF: So what did you think about the prospect of moving to Lynchburg, Virginia and all that would entail?        CM: Well, I was actually very excited about it. I guess it&#8217;s the way that God made me, the way I&#8217;m wired. I enjoy new adventures and new things to try, so I was very much in favor of it from the very beginning. So we literally rolled into Lynchburg with all of our earthly possession in a U-Haul trailer.         EF: Sure.         CM: So we moved here. At the time Liberty&#8217;s nursing program that they had was very small &#8211; in fact they were still working with Lynchburg General &#8211; and there wasn&#8217;t really any further education that I could do there. Also we actually needed the extra income, so I applied for a job here at the college. He went to school fulltime and worked as a relief pharmacist on the weekends. Joe could do that without actually getting a license here in the state. He was licensed in Texas but at that time &#8211; I don&#8217;t know what the rulings are now &#8211; he could work as a relief pharmacist, so that helped to cover our expenses. I actually, cold turkey, walked into the office, Dr. Falwell&#8217;s office because everything was housed in that one building, and said, &#8220;We&#8217;re new here.&#8221; We arrived about six weeks prior to classes starting to find housing and to get settled so I was a little bit ahead of the rush, and someone said, &#8220;Well, maybe Jimmy Thomas,&#8221; [who] was then the director of development, there outside of Dr. Falwell&#8217;s office, &#8220;I think I heard he may be looking for some help. Why don&#8217;t you go up there and ask them?&#8221; So, that is exactly what I did, walked in.        EF: And they had something.        CM: They had something.        EF: Wow.        CM: Interviewed me, and I honestly don&#8217;t remember the process, but I got the job.        EF: What was the job?        CM: It was an admin assistant job in Jimmy Thomas&#8217;s office, and he at the time was Dr. Falwell&#8217;s right-hand man for raising funds for this little tiny Lynchburg Baptist college.         EF: Right. So he was the main fundraiser.        CM: He was the main fundraiser, yeah. So the early buildings that were built here on campus, that were named from donors who actually funded the very early stages of the university. I actually worked with Jimmy Thomas and the field representatives in drawing up the legal documents, worked with the attorneys that were working and we drew up gift annuities and wills and legal documents for the actual foundation that really gave substance to the financial beginnings of Liberty University.        EF: That&#8217;s fascinating, and I definitely want to probe more about that, but if I can I want to go back briefly and ask about&#8211;. You mentioned that you watched Jerry Falwell on TV, and I wonder if you can explain a bit about your beliefs at that point in time and how Falwell influenced them and ultimately brought you and your husband to Lynchburg.        CM: Well we were in our early twenties. I had been a part of a church my entire life; however in growing up in church I think it&#8217;s kind of like, you know the analogy, when you&#8217;re around something you don&#8217;t always realize every&#8211;. You just morph into what you&#8217;re around, and that&#8217;s, unfortunately, I think what a lot of young people still do. I did that, did not realize really until I was away at boarding school &#8211; and really it grew stronger that first year of college &#8211; realizing that I&#8217;ve gone to church all my life but I really have not developed a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. That became real clear to me, that I needed to do that, my freshman year in college. I knew Bible stories, I knew scripture, I had memorized scripture; I had done all the right things, other than realizing the need, my personal need, for a savior, of why Jesus actually came. So when all of that started happening&#8211;. Plus, as a freshman in college, you&#8217;re seeing the world different too.        EF: Sure.        CM: Yeah, and that that was a real unique season in my life. I&#8217;d met Joe and we started going to this sweet little church there in Monroe and started growing in the word, reading the word, and God really touched my life in a real special way. Because of that Joe and I really bonded. I fell in love with him but we also fell in love with Jesus, about the same time, in a real special way. He was four years older than I and had already come to know the Lord and was a little bit further down the road spiritually than I was, but we were both very thirsty.         So when we arrived at Henderson, Texas, we were newly married, everything&#8217;s lovely, and I&#8217;m really grateful for that older couple that the Lord placed in our life to mentor us. They were real dear, real sweet, and real encouraging to us but it made us even more thirsty to know the Lord, to see what he had for our lives, something bigger and greater than living and working a nine-to-five job, and raising children and growing old, and that would be the end of it. So as we started going over to their home on Sunday evenings and listening to Dr. Falwell at the time, first of all it was to be a part of their lives, to be a part of, we called them &#8220;Brother Bill&#8221; and &#8220;Miss Janelle,&#8221; because that&#8217;s what you do in the deep South. They were pouring into our lives and telling us neat things of what the Lord had done for them, and we&#8217;d talk about different scriptures and things.         But then we would sit there and we would hear Jerry Falwell go through the music. Because their church service was on, on Sunday nights, and it naturally led into talking about what Jerry Falwell had just said and what he was doing, but at the time there were very few televangelists that were doing [that]. There was no one doing what he was doing. Not only was he sharing Christ but he wanted to be a world changer and to take the things that were beginning to happen in the United States. Roe v. Wade had just happened, the gay agenda had just started surfacing, and there were things there that seemed to be contrary to what we believed God&#8217;s word stated and what we felt like our nation was founded upon, the Christian principles. We had Madalyn Murray O&#8217;Hair trying to remove prayer from schools, so there was a major shift in the culture during that time. You had the Vietnam War so you had riots, and so there was a lot going on.         We grew hungry to be a part of not only what God was doing in our lives but to make a difference for our nation, and Dr. Falwell&#8217;s messages really moved and motivated us and we wanted to be a part of that. Joe knew he needed the training in order to do that and wanted to be a part of this new school. So that was really the real reason. We did look at other well-established seminaries that were years old, decades old, and felt led that this is where God wanted us to come, not to be a part of God&#8217;s kingdom and making a difference there but to be a part of our nation. So we came here, Joe graduated three years later, and we moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota to start a church.         EF: Okay.        CM: When we left here I was in the early stages of pregnancy with our first daughter, Krista, and I went up and started to work. We had a couple of seminary professors here that had connected us with people up there that were interested, because it was during that time, [19]79, [19]80, [19]81, [19]82, when Dr. Falwell was sending out.         EF: Right. The Moral Majority was happening at that time.        CM: All of that was happening. His goal was to start x amount of churches in this nation to make a difference, so we were part of that, so we left here to start a church and to make a difference. We went up, started that; our chartering service he and Robbie Hiner were there. We also timed it the same time that they were doing the &#8220;I Love America&#8221; rallies. In fact I have a picture album in there I&#8217;ll show you &#8211; I keep it on my desk &#8211; of that, &#8220;I Love America.&#8221; They were on the steps of St. Paul, the capital of Minnesota. They did the &#8220;I Love America&#8221; rally there. I don&#8217;t remember if that was the day before or the day after our chartering, but then Dr. Falwell and Robbie and that group came to the St. Paul Civic Center where we had basically the beginning of Twin Cities Baptist Church that he began. So, yeah. I don&#8217;t know if that answered your previous question.        EF: It absolutely does. I want to probe more. Before I ask more about Minnesota, can you describe what Liberty Bible College was like in the late [19]70s and the atmosphere here and what you recall most strikingly, I guess?        CM: The one thing that probably stands out in my mind the most is the air of excitement that was here. It was a new school but we had an incredible leader who loved life, loved the Lord, and loved his students. We all worked together as a team. Obviously it was a much smaller group of us. The classes were smaller. But everyone that arrived to Lynchburg arrived with an excitement and an enthusiasm and were ready to roll with whatever God had in store for us. That oozed in every classroom, in every hallway, church service. We would be on rickety old buses. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard about Treasure Island where the bus would go to the bridge. We would get off, that bus driver would faithfully drive that bus across that bridge, the students would then walk across the bridge, get back on the bus, and we&#8217;d drive back down into the other parts of Treasure Island.        EF: Sounds dangerous.        CM: Yes. But we didn&#8217;t care. We were here for a purpose. We felt like God had called us here, to come, to learn, to train, to allow Dr. Falwell to infuse us with his vision and his excitement, and to be a part of what God wanted us to do in our nation, and in the world, for that matter. We were sending out missionaries. We would have missions conferences. We would have different conferences throughout the school year and he would bring in the top of the line of pastors and speakers that would motivate us and teach us and train us.         So in the early days that was the atmosphere on campus, as well as when we&#8217;d have what we called Super Conference in the fall. That would be the big conference. All students were dismissed from classes. We would go and sit under these great teachers and speakers. He would also open it up. Remember, he was on national TV. People far and wide would roll in so we knew we&#8217;d get to meet other people who&#8217;d been watching on TV that wanted to be a part of Super Conference and be a part of what was happening here in little Lynchburg, Virginia, at Liberty.        EF: Right. So was it small enough during the time when you were here then to where you knew most of the other students in the seminary, or undergraduates? I mean how well-connected were students, I suppose?        CM: Well I can only personally speak for seminary, although [I&#8217;d be real confident in saying the same was true] for undergrad as well, but in seminary, yes. We knew about every student there, not perhaps as well as others, because you develop circles of friends.         EF: Of course.        CM: I can remember different professors inviting us over to their homes for cookouts. Dr. Diemer would love to play ping-pong so we always had ping-pong competitions any time we ever went over to his home. The professors&#8217; wives would have us over, as far as the students&#8217; wives or the female students, and have fun times together, things like that. So, yes; there was a very tight-knit relationship. With me working in Jimmy Thomas&#8217;s office and Dr. Falwell&#8217;s office we would quite frequently get to know a lot of the other undergrad students, either their spouses or things like that. Even for the ladies who opened the mail or for human resources or marketing: those were very small departments so, yes; I can honestly say we knew just about everyone.        EF: Right.        CM: And if we didn&#8217;t know them by name we most definitely recognized their faces, because we did everything together.         EF: Right. Working in that office, being around I guess the main engine for raising support, raising money, what were some of the ways that Liberty was raising money at that time, how successful was it?        CM: Well you had faith partners that Dr. Falwell mentioned. Hmm. Now you&#8217;re hitting me on my memory bank.        EF: That&#8217;s okay. Whatever you remember.        CM: Bricks campaigns, we had.         EF: Oh, sure.        CM: But it was clearly led with Dr. Falwell wanting to raise up a generation of champions to make a difference, so it really didn&#8217;t matter what the gift was. It was clear that there were different levels, and of course then when we ended up being able to purchase the first little piece of land over here and start building dorms and things like that, yes; obviously those amounts increased, whether it was bricks or being a part of the original donors and thing like that. Then you had also people who were &#8211; and even today &#8211; giving their estates to the university for a cause. Here at the law school Deryl Edwards, who was actually here as a student during that timeframe, is now our director of advancement here at the law school.        EF: I should interview him.        CM: Yeah.        EF: Deryl Edwards?        CM: Edwards, mm hmm. In fact he just walked to the door there. We sit around and tell old stories at different times to some of our younger staff and students here about the good old days. He actually lived in the hotel, which was two blocks down from the seminary, so we would all be on the same buses at different times. We were part of the brigade that boarded those buses and rode up the dirt road literally to where the first shovel of dirt was shoveled, with Dr. Falwell leading the pack and Robbie Hiner singing, &#8220;I Want That Mountain.&#8221; There&#8217;s a picture somewhere here on campus and in the archives of that huge group shot on that first mountaintop with nothing but grass and dirt and trees, and we&#8217;re part of that picture of that first moment where they actually dug that first shovel in. Yep.        EF: That&#8217;s fascinating.         CM: Yeah.         EF: So, he finishes seminary.        CM: Yep, he finishes seminary.        EF: And&#8211;        CM: We start the church.        EF: &#8211;you go to Minneapolis, and this was part of the wider initiative involved with not just Moral Majority but Liberty and putting people out into the world to raise churches.        CM: Right, being part of those champions for Christ, making a difference. Went there, and then this is where my personal testimony takes a little bit of a turn that you may not have been aware of. Obviously it&#8217;s not mentioned on that bio. Two years after we were there&#8211;. We had established a church. We were still meeting at a school; we did not have a building ourselves and everything. I had my daughter and I had just found out that I was six weeks pregnant with my son, that I had mentioned to you earlier that went to school here and stuff. Then Joe was killed in an accident. So, with that given situation I had really two choices, either to go back home to the little cotton patch community where my mom and dad were or to come back to Lynchburg.         When Joe and I were here in seminary we also helped to start Heritage Baptist Church with another seminary student, he and his wife. We had worked there with them. I played the piano and organ, Joe taught Sunday school, we were very much a part of that very early development of that church, which is now a very large church here in town. We wanted to be a part of that ground floor so that we would get that experience. When we left seminary they supported our work, even though they were a young church. At the time they were probably about a two hundred and fifty, three hundred congregation, and they supported us as a home missions. So two years into that now, when Joe died, that pastor and actually a couple of the deacons came and said, &#8220;We want to support you, and if you choose to come back here we want Heritage to be the New Testament church to support you as far as emotionally. We&#8217;ll help move you back here if you need assistance with that and be part of your extended family.&#8221;         So that&#8217;s what I chose, to come back here, at a real precious time in my life when I really needed that. But also I became community property. Everyone took very good care of me and Christa and walked me through that pregnancy. One of the couples in that church, her name is Sarah Tripp, she was a nurse at Virginia Baptist; so she walked me through the delivery at the time. It was real sweet, because I actually went into that labor to have Tim on a Wednesday afternoon, and of course at Wednesday night service that night Rod Kidd, the pastor, announced, &#8220;We need to pray for Cindy. She&#8217;s in labor,&#8221; and he said, &#8220;I should have just said, &#8216;Amen. You&#8217;re dismissed,&#8217;&#8221; because he said no one heard a single thing that night. Everybody was thinking about me, which was real sweet.         Then they had a switchboard at the hospital. I don&#8217;t know the system, but anyway the lady who actually ran the phone bank or the switchboard service at Virginia Hospital came to meet me because she said, &#8220;Whoever Cindy Birdwell is, I need to meet her because my switchboard has been lit up all night long with people checking on you.&#8221;         EF: Right.        CM: So it was a real special moment for me.        EF: What year was this?        CM: This was in [19]82.        EF: Okay.        CM: Yeah, November 4, 1982. Tim was born, and I was there, so I remained a part of Heritage Baptist Church during that time.        EF: Okay. So, let&#8217;s see. Okay, well, I guess what came next? Career-wise, life-wise?        CM: Okay. Well fortunately at that time, it was very, very tight, but I was able to stay at home with the children, which I&#8217;m very grateful for, being a single mom to them. Of course I did have the support of Heritage people and then people here as well. When Joe died Dr. Falwell called me and said, &#8220;I want you to know that we love you, we support you, and we will rally around you,&#8221; and when I did move back different professors at the seminary, different folks here at Liberty and stuff, came to see me and supported me and I felt like I was still part of that family, even though for both Liberty and for Heritage they had really grown quite a bit during those two years. But [they] became part of my extended family and I have no regrets whatsoever about making that decision to move back here. My children were very well-nurtured and established. They had a lot of extended aunts and uncles and cousins, and to this day even they still call certain people aunts or uncles or we celebrate different holidays and things. We feel like they&#8217;re still part of our extended family.         But to fast forward through the next six years, that&#8217;s basically what happened. Then I met a gentleman, actually at Word of Life. I went up to hear some speakers one summer up there. It&#8217;s a Christian camp up in the Adirondacks Mountains in upper New York State. I actually met a guy there from Richmond. His name was Don Matthews. Long story short, we met, came back, and ended up seeing each other for about a year and ended up marrying, got married about a year later, and thus we had my third child that I mentioned to you, Kara, in 1990. So he moved us to Richmond and actually that&#8217;s where really all three of my children had the bulk of their middle school and high school education, things like that.         EF: Okay.        CM: So from there then as the two older children finished up they came back to school here, and today my son &#8211; I mentioned to you earlier &#8211; he graduated from Liberty and is now a teacher at E. C. Glass and an adjunct professor at Randolph in history. My oldest daughter ended up marrying a young man from the Harrisburg, Pennsylvania area and she lives there with her children.        EF: Okay.        CM: My youngest daughter, Kara, actually was a volleyball player in high school. She ended up being recruited for Lynchburg College here, played for them, and in that process, prior to her finishing school, her dad had some things in his life that he did not handle real well, so he stepped out of our lives from that point. So with my son here &#8211; who ended up marrying and is now teaching, and his wife&#8217;s teaching &#8211; Kara here playing volleyball for Lynchburg College, I naturally wanted to come back.         EF: Of course.        CM: Plus I had raised my children at that time and I was working. I had ventured back into the work scene. Don had a marketing company in which I ended up working part time with him, and that&#8217;s where the marketing skills were honed. During that time period I learned those things and ended up working with a large company in Richmond. I was an executive assistant there but I also carried a fifty-fifty weight of marketing, and really enjoyed it, really did. I had not really experienced that much until I started working with Don and helping him with some things when the kids were in school, and saw that it was a gift and a skill set that I really enjoyed. So I pursued that, and took some classes and some other training and things like that, and moved on with that.         So back to then fast forward to Kara and being here her freshman year playing, and my son, so I was spending a lot of time on the weekends coming to Lynchburg.        EF: Right. Which year was that that she started at Lynchburg College?        CM: She started there. Okay, let me think about it.         EF: It doesn&#8217;t have to be precise.        CM: Let&#8217;s back up. Okay, she graduated in 2008, so 2008, 2009.        EF: Okay, I see. So she&#8217;s playing volleyball there&#8211;        CM: She&#8217;s playing volleyball there.        EF: &#8211;but you&#8217;re still in Richmond.        CM: I&#8217;m still in Richmond, splitting my time, and I&#8217;m thinking, hey; and I would love to work back at Liberty, perhaps. So the Lord opened up a door. One of the professors here went to church and was good friends with my son and his wife, and they had been praying for me and had been praying for about six or nine months for direction, and, &#8220;My mom would like to come back here. She&#8217;s really not sure if she should. There&#8217;s lots of opportunities for her. She&#8217;s doing well in the company she&#8217;s at, but she misses us as a family unit.&#8221; This professor of law said, [when] they were over&#8211;. I&#8217;ll never forget. It was 2010 during a major snowstorm and they were having dinner, getting ready to head home before the snow hit, [and] this professor said, &#8220;You know, the dean&#8217;s assistant is leaving and he needs a replacement. Would that be something that your mom would be interested in?&#8221; so the rest of the story is I&#8217;ve been here now for four years.        EF: Wow.        CM: Yeah, four and a half years actually.        EF: That&#8217;s great.        CM: Yeah, and as a result of that, my daughter finished Lynchburg, and me working here enabled her to obtain her grad degree in sports management.         EF: Okay.        CM: I knew very little about Dean Matt Staver before I came but I have really grown to love him and appreciate his vision and his mission here at the law school.          EF: Well tell me I guess a bit more about your time here at the law school and the work that you do, and that sort of thing.        CM: Well, I support the dean Matt Staver, in all administrative needs that he has. I also help to manage some other admin assists that are here as well as student workers that we have, and then work with the team that&#8217;s here. We have the admissions team, we have the registrar, we have the dean of internal affairs, director of student affairs, all the different branches, and work with that. I do scheduling for the dean; I do his travel. The next big event I have on my plate right now is planning for the dean&#8217;s reception for our incoming class, our students coming in. I also help during the school year when there are student issues. When they need to come in and meet with the dean I do scheduling with that, the professors that need to come in, a lot of hosting with special guests, special speakers, and then interfacing with the Liberty University leadership, with different matters and things like that. Just being that admin assistant, that executive assistant.        EF: Yeah, crucial.        CM: Yep, juggling a lot of plates in the air some days.         EF: It sounds like it. So obviously the Liberty Law School is in the news a good bit about multiple items, so I wondered if you could speak a bit about the school in general. What do you perceive as the mission or the mindset and the level of activism that the Liberty Law School is trying to instill in its students?        CM: Well first of all every student that comes to Liberty Law is a different law student than the norm. We teach everything based on a Christian worldview here. If a student is wanting a standard degree and is not interested in using the true foundation of law, which is based on scripture, and using that overall Christian worldview then perhaps they need to consider a different law school to attend. But our faculty from day one, even in that interview process, the focus is that Christian worldview, going back to the foundations of law and the importance of that. So once you establish that with the student base it trickles through everything that happens here at the law school.         Our dean, our faculty, our staff, everything that we do is based on that Christian worldview, and it really goes back to the original mission and calling that Dr. Falwell had on his life, that whole premise. I know our school, we&#8217;re now considered the largest Christian university around and it&#8217;s based on that Christian principle, on God&#8217;s word, on training champions for Christ. Our classes are started out with prayer, our day here for faculty and staff are started out. We ground everything we have in God&#8217;s word and the purpose of our law students, obviously some are coming here to practice law, family law, everyday business law, but they want that Christian foundation. Others are here because they want to make a difference in our nation, in our laws, and law is the only profession that actually touches every other aspect of all other professions out there, whether it&#8217;s in education, medical, business; it doesn&#8217;t matter. Law touches every other piece of our economic in our society, so it&#8217;s important to have that.         We have grads on Capitol Hill. We have a couple of graduates that have been elected in Congress. I believe we have one that was recently elected in the state of Tennessee as a judge. So it&#8217;s important to get as many out there as we can. We have seen recently how quickly either one Supreme Court judge can turn our nation upside down, as well as a president in a short period of time can change the whole dynamics of our society, so it&#8217;s important to have that Christian influence that our nation was founded upon.         EF: So what are some of the major &#8211; &#8220;goals&#8221; isn&#8217;t the right word, but what are some of the major, I guess political questions, or political issues that the law school here really tries to tackle and address through teaching the students as well as through litigation and bringing forth lawsuits and that sort of thing?        CM: Issues? Are you talking about maybe more like social issues or are you talking about direct laws?        EF: I suppose either. I&#8217;m trying to get at the root of what Liberty law students and professors are moving towards, like specific policies. I&#8217;ve seen in the news like healthcare, maybe separation between church and state issues, or anything like that. Do you see anything as being primary or major goals?  CM: Well all of the major social issues we&#8217;re focused on, whether it be, like you mentioned, the Obamacare issues that we are dealing with. Liberty University was the first university to file a lawsuit against that, where we feel that it is infringing upon our Christian rights to make us pay for something that we strongly stand against, for abortions, or the morning-after pill, things like that. So that&#8217;s one. You&#8217;ve got the same-sex marriage agenda that&#8217;s out there. All of the major social issues, yes, are front and center, what we&#8217;re training our students in. I&#8217;m not an attorney. I&#8217;m not an expert in that. I can give you a general idea, but other than that, I mean I&#8217;m not exactly sure what you&#8217;re asking for other than, yes; those current social issues are very important to us. It&#8217;s very important that we ground our law students with that Christian worldview because without that they&#8217;re going to be easily shaken.        EF: That&#8217;s all I was asking for. I was really interested in getting your own views of the major emphases here at the school, and that certainly answers it.         Most of my questions are really about finished. Part of this project is looking at different conservative voices, especially conservative women&#8217;s voices and looking at the ways in which they work towards goals, whether in the workforce, or at home, or politics, or church, or any other place. So I&#8217;m trying to add to a growing archive on voices of feminism and looking at the rise of feminism in its various forms since the 1960s, 1970s, so I&#8217;m interested to hear what your own thoughts are. What does feminism mean to you?        CM: [Laughs]        EF: I know it&#8217;s a broad question.        CM: It&#8217;s very broad. [Laughs]        EF: If it&#8217;s too broad then it&#8217;s okay, but I&#8217;m curious to ask what you think about it.        CM: Well, I&#8217;ll tell you the first thing. I mean this is such a random question, but the first thing actually that comes to my mind is that I feel I am very blessed as a woman living in the time period that I&#8217;m living in. I&#8217;m very grateful that I don&#8217;t have the hardships of women that lived centuries prior to me, so I&#8217;m very grateful for that. However, I do feel that as a whole women who are not appreciative of what God designed us to be, as far as our role and our position perhaps in the home, maybe is a little bit different than what some maybe appreciate. I feel like that God designed a family unit from the very beginning with Adam and Eve, one man and one woman, and I feel like that the woman&#8217;s role is to love and to nurture in that home. If a woman can do that, be home, and he designed our bodies to bring birth and to have the ability to birth that baby and to nurture and love that baby, then I feel like she needs to stay in the home and do so.         Now I know that you probably look at me as being from the Baby Boomer generation but I&#8217;ve actually experienced both, being able to stay at home and be a fulltime mom as well as be a career-minded fulltime professional. There&#8217;s value in both but I also think that you need to keep everything in the right perspective. My children mean more to me than a paycheck, and I realize that in today&#8217;s society, in our economic situation where most of us live, for a mom to be able to stay at home, that is not possible. They need that paycheck. But I would urge young professional women to not feel like they have to be a super mom, because it&#8217;s very hard to find that right balance. You can feel very fulfilled in loving your children and being the very best mom you can be and also working outside the home, but something has to give and you have to be very careful with that. With that balance is where the church needs to come in and to really love and support the working families that are out there and to recognize the challenges that we have on a daily basis. But I&#8217;m very happy that God allowed me to live in the era that I&#8217;m living in and I&#8217;m very happy that I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to both be a stay-at-home mom and to love and nurture my children as well as to continue to love and nurture them and yet be able to find a sweet balance in working fulltime as well. But it&#8217;s a job. It&#8217;s hard.         EF: Sure. Well thank you. That concludes all of my questions. Is there anything else you&#8217;d like to add?        CM: No. I can&#8217;t think of anything.        EF: Okay. Well thank you for your time.        CM: Okay.        EF: I appreciate it.
