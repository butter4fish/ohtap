Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe, I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.
Speaker 2: Hello Larry.
Speaker 1: Our videographer is Matthew Hickey. Sir, could you please give us your full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Sure. Michael [HistoryMaker Michael Jack], M-I-C-H-A-E-L, Jack, J-A-C-K.
Speaker 1: Okay. No middle name?
Speaker 2: No middle name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Every once in a while just for fun, I put an X between the two, (laughter) just to keep the conversation going.
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story behind the name Jack, the last name Jack?
Speaker 2: It's a story that--and a question I've asked my father [Huston Jack, Jr.] on more than one occasion, and he doesn't seem to know, but we probably, our history is such that we go back through Alabama, like so many of us who come from the South, probably were given the name by one of the slave owners and, as you know, many times we're weren't dignified to get a full last name, so, but there are enough Jacks floating around the country that we do have some associations, so, I've asked a couple of 'em and nobody's quite come up with it yet.
Speaker 1: Ok, I know I asked you before the interview if you're related to--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Hulan Jack the borough president of the Harlem [New York, New York], years ago (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: --but you don't know.
Speaker 2: Don't know, but, you know, if he's a good guy and has a lot of money, I probably should know him (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right. Now, sir--
Speaker 2: Or if he has a vacation home (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay. So, sir what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Six, six, fifty-one [June 6, 1951]. I was born in Berlin, Germany.
Speaker 1: Okay. And what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I am president and general manager of WRC-TV in Washington, D.C. A little caveat on that Berlin, Germany, my dad was in the [U.S.] Army, so I think I was born not in the military hospital, but he was, you know, in the [U.S.] military at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One of the other things we'll figure out at some point in time.
Speaker 1: Okay. And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is, that's a tough one, September 28th, 2007.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are in the conference room at WRC-TV in Washington, D.C.
Story_ID: 613007
Speaker 1: We start the interview with five lightweight questions as a warm up basically. Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Favorite color would be blue.
Speaker 1: Okay. A favorite food?
Speaker 2: Favorite food is anything that starts with a B and ends with Q, so generally, my favorite meal is barbeque ribs. Used to be potato salad, but I'm on this low carb thing, so barbecue ribs, greens and anything else I wanna put in, usually not coleslaw (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay. All right, now vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite?
Speaker 2: Vacation destinations. Since we have a ten year old [Truce Jack], life has changed and it's wherever we can find a place where she can have fun, family activities, so we've been going to the Dominican Republic to kind of these all inclusive kind of places. So I would say Jamaica, Mexico.
Speaker 1: Okay. Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Time of the year would be spring and fall. Time of the day is definitely morning.
Speaker 1: Okay. And the last question in this set is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Favorite phrase or saying. Probably not, but I'll think about it. It'll probably come to me before we're done.
Story_ID: 613008
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and your father's [Huston Jack, Jr.] side.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But we'll start with your mother's side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Her name is Johanna, J-O-H-A-N-N-A, Magreta, M-A-G-R-E-T-A, I believe. Kresse is her maiden name, K-R-E-S-S-E, and the married name is Jack [Johanna Kresse Jack].
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her birth was in Berlin, Germany, and I did the math earlier so I think it's 1930.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. Now what do you know about your mother's side of the family? How far back can you trace your mother's side?
Speaker 2: To my mother and my grandmother, and her sister. So my mother's mother, her name was Margaret [ph.], and my mother had a sister, whose name was Ursula [ph.]. My mother's mother, my grandmother, I knew past when I was probably twelve. She lived in Berlin on the, what we now, well what was then the east side of Berlin as opposed--so she really lived in the eastern sector for her entire life after the war [World War II, WWII]. And my mother's sister, Ursula, lived with her. She was ill. She probably died when I was fourteen. And that's really all I know. When I was--want me to elaborate?
Speaker 1: Sure, yeah.
Speaker 2: When I was younger, my dad was in the [U.S.] Army and we moved every couple of years from the U.S. back to Germany, and spent time with her, her being my grandmother and aunt, while we lived in Germany on different military bases, we would see them probably three, four times a year, and I remember going to East Berlin [Germany] going through, to the Communist bloc, you know, the Checkpoint Charlie, to go see them. That's really all I know. I, I, actually one more thing. My grandfather on my mother's side, who I never met, died during the war. There is a, the story is that he was arrested and don't really know who arrested him, but he, they were told that he fell off a truck and died, you know. I believe his occupation, he was a baker.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you say he was arrested by the Nazis I guess then.
Speaker 2: I don't know if he was arrested by the Nazis. I probably should have asked my mother before I spoke to you, but, yeah, I think you could probably assume that. It wasn't by anybody else 'cause this was still during the war (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This was during Nazi Germany, reign.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: That's fair to say.
Story_ID: 613009
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother [Johanna Kresse Jack] have any stories about the, did she tell any stories about the, about the war [World War II, WWII], or growing up during that era?
Speaker 2: I think, yeah, not many. She's been relatively quiet about that. The one that sticks out in my mind, in addition to the difficult times of not having enough food, being there I think during the bombings or maybe that's my recollection because in going back years afterwards to Berlin [Germany], my [maternal] grandmother lived in an area where there were still bombed out buildings and you could see the bullet holes, et cetera. But a story I remember the most was she and her girlfriend escaped or left Germany just as some of the Allied troops were coming to town. Don't know if it was Russian or U.S. or whatever the case may be, just because of all the craziness that was going on. I think she was a young woman at the time and she was concerned about physically being abused et cetera, so they took off, went someplace by train. I wanna say Holland [the Netherlands], but, again, not really clear. It's been many, many, many years since she's mentioned anything about it.
Speaker 1: Okay. So she, she got of there before--
Speaker 2: She got out of there, yep, yep. Must have made her way back to Berlin at some point in time after the war, met my father [Huston Jack, Jr.] in '50 [1950], I was born in '51 [1951], so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. Now she's a German woman?
Speaker 2: She's a German woman, um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right. Okay. Did she tell stories about what the, what her family did, you know?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: That's probably the extent of what I know about her family and what the family legacy is. One of the things I said to you earlier Larry [Larry Crowe], is that I'm bugging my dad about trying to put some of the family history on at least, forget about videotape, but at least a tape recorder.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Got to do the same thing with my mother, although my father interestingly says, "You wanna know about my family, ask, ask, ask your mother" (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, did she have a chance to finish high school or go to college or?
Speaker 2: No, no. She, I would suspect that she did finish high school. She's a smart lady. I remember her as being mostly a stay at home mom who worked in different factories, at different points in time, and also was a secretary for a period of time, but no.
Story_ID: 613010
Speaker 1: Well, can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure. My father's name was Huston, H-U-S-T-O-N, Jack, Jr. [Huston Jack, Jr.].
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born in Bessemer, Alabama in 1931. Again, 'cause I just did the math earlier today, and what was the other question?
Speaker 1: What date of birth and place of birth? You gave it, yeah.
Speaker 2: August 3rd, '31 [1931].
Speaker 1: Now it's, you know Bessemer is right outside of Birmingham [Alabama], right?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Is there, what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side? How far back can you trace them, or are there any stories about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. Not, not, not very far, kind of same scenario. That's why I'm bugging him to start putting all this on, on tape. My father's father, who died when he was young, also named Huston [Huston Jack, Sr.], he remembers little about him. He knows he was a miner, thinks he was a coal miner. Not sure how much coal mining there is in Alabama, but he died when he was young. My father had a brother named Alfred [Alfred Jack]. My grandmother, Fay [Fannette Rucker (ph.)], at some point in time left Bessemer and moved to New York City [New York, New York] where she married my, what I call my grandfather, James Rucker [ph.], so he was not my paternal grandfather, but he was the grandfather that I knew. And James Rucker basically was the man in the house for my father and his brother.
Speaker 1: And so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And they lived in Harlem [New York, New York] for a number of years and my grandfather worked in the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service] his entire life. I think it was on 135th Street, sounds right. And then had other relatives, all in around Harlem, don't stay much in touch with 'em. Grandfather retired and moved to Englewood, New Jersey, and that was probably when I was, I have pictures of my cousin and I, who also lives in Washington [D.C.], probably we were six or seven years old, around Christmas, so we'd go see them Christmas and Easter and, you know, all the holidays in Englewood, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Don't know a whole lot more about the family. I know that my Uncle Alfred passed away, let's see, he passed away when I was probably twenty-two, twenty-three. So I have some cousins who are, one of them lives in D.C. and another one also passed away a number of years ago. And I believe his wife has remarried since but don't know a whole lot about them. One of the, one of the cousins, as I think this through, is living in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] now, where my father and mother [Johanna Kresse Jack] lived, works for the L.A. port authority [Port of Los Angeles]. No, it's not port authority, the airport authority, was involved with security there. I think he's either head of security or got a very important job. He was in the [U.S.] military for a number of years.
Speaker 1: Do you have any stories about your father growing up in Harlem?
Speaker 2: Just the ones that he tells, you know so they're probably (laughter), the, the, I think every family has this story. My father would talk about one of his jobs was carrying ice, you know, on his back up the tenements to make money and I'm sure he did it, but he probably didn't work as hard or as fast, and he probably didn't make as little money as we would like to, or as he would like to tell the story. Then the little stories that he would talk about being a little knucklehead but really, I guess compared to things that are going on today, probably nothing. I think nothing much beyond that, you know. He, I think moving out of the city was a major step for him getting into the military.
Speaker 1: So did he go in right after high school?
Speaker 2: I don't think he finished high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think, I haven't challenged him on this but I, I think he went to, got into the military for, you know upward mobility. I think he finished high school in the military. I'm not sure if that was a requirement at that point in time, so I may be wrong on the facts, but I know he went in very, very young.
Story_ID: 613011
Speaker 1: He [Jack's father, Huston Jack, Jr.], it's an interesting story, he obviously met my mother [Johanna Kresse Jack], I was born, worked hard. He was retired from the [U.S. military] service after twenty years. He was master sergeant when he retired and one of the things that he prided himself for, on, I think, was the fact that he either never or rarely shot a rifle, or any other gun, after basic training, so he kind of got in the service post Second World War [World War II, WWII], got out pre, but wasn't involved with the Korean conflict [Korean War], but he managed to do things, I remember him with desk jobs, but also doing things like refereeing basketball. His job in the service for a number of years was to referee basketball, baseball and football games. Not a bad deal, not a bad deal at all. So, but, but he also always had a love for his education and learning, so when he left the service I was a senior in high school [John F. Kennedy High School, Willingboro, New Jersey]. I'm trying to remember how we got to Willingboro, New Jersey. So, he left the service, we moved from Heidelberg, Germany to Willingboro, New Jersey, one of the suburbs outside of New York [New York] and Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], and he went and finished his final year of college 'cause he had been going to college commuting, not commuting, what's it called when you do it not at the main campus? Anyways, he had three years of college and finished at Park College in Missouri [Park University, Parkville, Missouri]. Then he came back and he taught black history in the high school I graduated--the year after I graduated.
Speaker 2: That's interesting, so.
Speaker 1: Yeah. It's good that I got out (laughter). Then he became a guidance counselor the next year and then he became a assistant principal I believe.
Speaker 2: So he was teaching black history about 1970 I guess that, did you come out of high school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sounds right, sounds right, sounds right. Um-hm, 1970, 1971. Then was a guidance counselor, and then can't remember if he came out, no, he left then to go back to the military school system in Europe because he went back to Germany with my mother and younger brother [Clifford Jack] at the time, and that's when I believe he became the assistant principal and then became a principal. So he was the principal at a couple of different schools in Germany, all military bases and then left that and came to Los Angeles [California], both he and my mother and I want to say that was probably twenty, twenty something odd years ago. So they've been living in L.A. for the last twenty years.
Speaker 2: All right. So he basically retired then--
Speaker 1: Retired from a second career, yep. Then he took a, started teaching English as a second language to folks who spoke Spanish in the L.A. unified school system [Los Angeles Unified School District] and he has helped handicapped, handicapped kids in the L.A. unified school system. Then he got out of that, played around with being a--going to law school, which didn't last very long, so the last thing he's been serious about has been, being a dancer on cruise ships. So (laughter)--
Speaker 2: So he's a good dancer, huh?
Speaker 1: I told he wasn't--he's no dummy. What he does is he goes on a cruise ship. I think he pays taxes and might not even be that, and he is a good dancer and he will dance with women who are there, they have their multiple dance hosts, kind of like that movie a number of years ago, so that's what he's been doing.
Speaker 2: He's like a dance host on that ship.
Speaker 1: He's a dance host. He gets to travel the world and does a little dance thing, so there's a career for all of us (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's not bad. He's had some interesting jobs, refereeing basketball and stuff, he's a dance host (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 613012
Speaker 1: Now is there, is there a story that your parents tell about how they met or?
Speaker 2: I know my father [Huston Jack, Jr.] was in the honor guard. He, the honor guard is, the drill team, you know the rifle and the shiny helmets, et cetera, so that's what he was doing. I don't remember the exact moment. I remember most about their marriage or that time was the difficulty they had in getting married. Remember this was back in the '50s [1950s] and I remember him talking about how his lieutenant or major or colonel was opposed to him being a African American man marrying a white woman [Johanna Kresse Jack] and that they had difficulty getting somebody to marry them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's primarily the story. Then everything becomes the most important story 'cause it's all about me. No I'm just kidding (laughter). The story they tell really is about me being born and hospital visit and [maternal] grandmother being around, but that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I imagine it was a struggle. Are there any specific things that were said to 'em or, or done to block them from getting married.
Speaker 2: No, other than, I don't know the exact words, flat out saying you can't do it, it's, I know there was a bible passage that he referred to.
Speaker 1: The commanding officer--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --pulled out a bible passage?
Speaker 2: Again, this is distant memory and my recollection, but they clearly were opposed to it and they had difficulty finding somebody to marry them.
Speaker 1: It sounds likely. I'm just, I'm just saying, I'm just incredulous that he would quote a bible passage in the capacity as commander to discourage a marriage (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This is America (laughter), this is America. I wouldn't be surprised if it happens today.
Speaker 1: Now what about your mother? Did, were there, did her relative discourage her from marrying your father?
Speaker 2: I don't think so. First of all, the only person who was alive was my grandmother and her sister, and my grandmother was one of those people that if you had to pencil out what a grandmother does and says and one of those perfect kind of grandmothers. So I don't, I don't think so. I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There's also--a different tolerance has been historically of Europeans as it relates to being much more open to African Americans than, than certainly white America is or ever has been, and that's true. Germans in particular. And I just think of the mentality at the time, while the U.S. won the war [World War II, WWII], in many cases it was liberating German civilians from what could have been a much worse outcome. Those who at the time were, Germany was divided up among the Allies and better to have the Americans occupy your territory than Russians, for instance, bad reputation. And the other option I think was the British, but don't recall any of them talking about that, that's more historic context than anything. Want some water?
Speaker 1: No, no, I'm fine. So, okay. Was your mother, did she ever talk about her initial reaction to life in the United States and that--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --'cause we all know the United States in the 1950s was not, you know, Germany, so (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. Yeah, I don't think she's ever really talked about the prejudice that they obviously lived under. What she really talked about more was adjusting to life in America, being young and away from her family and friends, and difficulties of finding a job and keeping a job and then just kind of the adjustment within the family of getting along with certain parts of the family, not other parts of the family. For some reason I think my father was traveling for a period of time, excuse me, when we first got, got here. So she is certainly, those were not the easiest times, but over the years she (laughter), I think she probably considers herself more of an American than any of us in this room. She's one of those, she talks about the us and the thems. I have to correct her on occasion. And where'd you come from? You can't be talking about immigrants, you know. We all came to this country at one point in time, so.
Story_ID: 613013
Speaker 1: Now, when you, you think about your parents' personalities and talents and characteristics, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I, I probably, this is not ducking the question, but a little of both. I'm closer to my father [Huston Jack, Jr.], no question. But by way of characteristics, physically I look more like my mother [Johanna Kresse Jack]. Both are smart and stubborn, which I've been accused of being, at least the stubborn part. My mother has got a strong will and willpower. You know strong will can go either direction. A good kind of strong willness. As does my father, you know. In different ways. My father is much more extroverted than my mother, so I have to say a little of both.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: That's a cop out, isn't it (laughter)?
Speaker 1: No, a lot of people say that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: A lot of people say that.
Story_ID: 613014
Speaker 1: Well tell me, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: The earliest childhood memory. The earliest childhood memory I have is when--two, one we were in Massachusetts, I only know, Fort Devens military base [Massachusetts] and we went to a drive-in and it was, it was a movie and the giant took people and they put them in this big vat and they, he put them into the vat to make wine, so they would take people, they put 'em in the vat and you'd have to stomp on the wine (laughter), so that's one. Another one I remember was us, also at the same time, car breaking down on the road in the middle of the winter and being stuck out there. I mean everything turned out okay, but clearly I remember being awoken, my father [Huston Jack, Jr.] gave me some root beer and we got on the road and the car broke down. And that probably, if you ask him, probably all happened, there were eleven different days but in my mind it all kind of stuck as one event. So those are probably my first memories.
Story_ID: 613015
Speaker 1: Now you were born in Germany. How long did your parents live there before you moved back to the states?
Speaker 2: I think I was two, so I was born there, my dad [Huston Jack, Jr.] was in the [U.S.] military. I don't think we lived on a military base, I think we lived with my [maternal] grandma, I may be wrong, so I was two, two and a half, we moved to Massachusetts, Fort Devens. And then I'd spend most of my life every three years moving back and forth from military bases in Germany to military bases in the U.S. until my dad got out of the [U.S. military] service and then we moved to Willingboro, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: What year was that when he got out?
Speaker 2: He got out in '70 [1970].
Speaker 1: Okay. So always--up until the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Could have been '69 [1969], yeah.
Speaker 1: Up until you went to high school basically?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You were alternating between being here and then in Germany (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. Germany because my mother's family wanted to be close to my mother [Johanna Kresse Jack], and obviously my dad wanted to be close to his family here.
Story_ID: 613016
Speaker 1: Well, that's a, it's a unique upbringing--bringing, to be sure, and what are some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Of growing up?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, sticking in that theme, it was moving every couple years, which was, I say this to people now, I encourage them to move because what it does is give you, it's good (unclear), it gives you the ability to pick up and leave and not be traumatized by it. It's probably not the best thing in relationships over the years, because it's not such a traumatic event, but for people who are born and raised in one town, professionally, today, our challenge with I can't move my family, it's really not that difficult, but for me I do remember that I was in the third grade, it was a pretty difficult move because it was my first girlfriend and I also was in love with my teacher. I think we all been there and thinking back on it at this moment, how was I, did I have my first girlfriend and I was in love with my teacher all the same, so that precedent is set (laughter). So that time was traumatic. Other than that, you know, probably after a week it was pretty easy, so for me my childhood was happy, and moving different places--always involved with athletics, played baseball, basketball, football, so spending most of my free activity doing things like that. Good student, good friends. Parents [Johanna Kresse Jack and Huston Jack, Jr.], while they still live in the same city, they've been separated for, I don't know, over twenty-five years now, still in each other's lives, but part of the, part of the history is dealing with a relationship there that's not, wasn't always perfect. So that's kind of, you talk about the smell of it all, it always, there were great times and there were difficult times, but all in all it was a good, good childhood. We vacationed once a year. I remember one of the times when we were in Europe, we would get in the car, take a tent and go someplace. So one year we went to Belgium, the next year we went to Italy. We get there (laughter), I just thought of this now, when I say tent I don't mean a little pup tent. I don't know if you've ever seen these big massive tents, but in Europe at the time, I'm sure it exists now, people would do that and we would buy or we would have this tent that was a master section, then it had like a dining room section, then it had a sleeping section. I'll never forget when I was probably in seventh or eighth grade, my father and I had an argument because what he would want to do is take this tent before we got on the road and lay it out on the ground and it was massive and elaborate and he would have to build it, and then take it all down. So, when I say we were tenting and camping, it was, you get to the campground and it's got hot and cold running water but at the end of the day it was all fun. So that's kind of the life, but a good one.
Story_ID: 613017
Speaker 1: Now was, was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: No, not really. We occasionally, we'd go to church on Easter, whether we had to or not we'd always get dressed up on Easter. Christmas, if I were around the grandparents, we'd always go visit the grandparents, so I need to step back on that statement, we'd always go to church, but as an active part of our life, no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother [Johanna Kresse Jack] is Methodist. My father [Huston Jack, Jr.], I couldn't even tell you, probably, I think the family is Baptist, but I'm not sure that he's a practice- practicing Baptist, but it was not a big part of my upbringing.
Story_ID: 613018
Speaker 1: What about music? Did you play an instrument or anything?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh. Didn't play an instrument. Completely untalented. I think I'm passing it down to my daughter [Truce Jack], who's tried three and (laughter), no. (Unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now do you have any siblings or are you the only child?
Speaker 2: No, I got a brother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Brother. His name's Clifford [Clifford Jack]. He's twelve years younger than me. He was born in Heidel- I'll say Heidelberg, Germany, again on a military base. He lives in Denver [Colorado]. He's vice president of, I wanna say vice president of marketing, that's probably not the right title, for a large insurance company, and has a couple thousand people working for him all in the insurance investment side. He's got two beautiful daughters who are now seven, so I'm an uncle, and a son who is nine, so he's been married for about, not about, he's been married for ten years.
Speaker 1: So basically, you were raised by yourself, you know, as an only child, for the most of your childhood (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) For a while, for a while. He was twelve when I was born [sic.], so.
Speaker 1: You had a little tiny brother.
Speaker 2: Yep, yep, yep.
Speaker 1: It doesn't play a big life, a big part of life for most teenagers.
Speaker 2: No, no. It was one of those, I'm sitting in the car and they go, here's your brother (laughter). So, we're very close now, as close as you can be being this many miles away. He's a terrific person, wonderful father. Just a good man. He is my mother's [Johanna Kresse Jack] best friend, which I really respect him for, in addition to being, as I say, a terrific father, so, good person.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now did--
Speaker 2: But he's still my punk kid brother.

Speaker 1: Did the media play any, a big part of your growing up? Here, you're on a, you're being raised during the age of television, the early ages of television. I don't know what it was like in Europe in those days, but TV, movies, radio, what role did all that, those things play?
Speaker 2: While we were in Germany, remember every three years we moved, TV, the only TV that existed was a little Armed Forces TV [Armed Forces Radio and Television Service; American Forces Network] so you got an occasional hour here and there of U.S. television, reruns and whatever the show of the day was, 'The Lawrence Welk Show,' or this is way before 'Bonanza,' I think, so you get a little of that. And then you watched German TV and German TV was government run at the time so it was a lot of, you know, really stodgy, not a lot of entertainment value. I enjoy watching the Olympics and I try to tell my wife [Mary Jack], I know about skating. The reason I know about skating is 'cause in German television, in the, in the '60s [1960s], that's all you could see, a bunch of skating, and I did speak German, but I don't speak it as well anymore.
Speaker 1: So the winter sports were very popular I guess in Germany?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was government run TV and it was very high brow, but it was the only thing that existed at the time, so media really didn't play that much of a part, probably radio more than anything. Just like any other teenager, you knew what was going on and then again, there was one channel. You had armed, armed services, Armed Forces--
Speaker 1: Armed Forces radio [Armed Forces Radio and Television Service; American Forces Network].
Speaker 2: Armed Forces radio, that's what you got. And then when I moved back to, I went to junior high school in Jersey [New Jersey] it was, let's see what year was that, not doing the math in my head, but no different--it was never. The question is did I have a lifelong ambition to go into media? Absolutely not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I watched TV and it was an entertainment value but never a calling.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you didn't think about, well, you know, I'd like to be on television--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --or be a personality or announcer or anything like that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no. I knew nothing about this business until I got to New York [New York]. I went to college outside of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], a place called Haverford College [Haverford, Pennsylvania], and part of the, my junior and senior year was an exchange program to a school called Bryn Mawr [Bryn Mawr College, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania], which is an all-girls school. I went there for, I'm no dummy, it was an all-girls school, there were a couple of us on an exchange program there, and when I graduated in political science, I knew really only one thing, I wanted to go to New York. That's what I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: Okay, well I don't want to get you there too far.
Story_ID: 613020
Speaker 1: How many different grade schools did you go to, what do you think?
Speaker 2: Oh, probably three or four.
Speaker 1: Three or four, okay. All right. Did you, you just said you were a good student?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite subject in grade school?
Speaker 2: Math maybe, mostly liked math, history.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did you get involved, you said you played a lot of sports, did you play on teams and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: What did you play, pretty much?
Speaker 2: In baseball, I played mostly shortstop. In basketball, I was small forward. In footfall, I was split end, which is what it was called at the time, and I played defensive end. I played high school football and basketball and played college basketball my first year [at Haverford College, Haverford, Pennsylvania]. I had a bunch of knee operations and then essentially retired (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay. So what was the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: It was John F. Kennedy High School in Willingboro, New Jersey, and then I went, my freshman year it was Heidelberg High School [Heidelberg American High School] in Heidelberg, Germany.
Speaker 1: That was your freshman year?
Speaker 2: Freshman year.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now did you have, were there any particular teachers or mentors around that you remember, people that you looked up to and maybe helped you, you know, or were some guidance, that had something, delivered some guidance to you?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, not in--no, not in elementary school, other than my homeroom teacher that I told you I was in love with as we are with our homeroom teachers. I probably looked up to my coaches along the way, but not really.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: All right. So when you were in high school were you involved in clubs and things, or were there other African American students around, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. We, not really any clubs. The only thing I was involved with was athletics. I'm trying to think if I was involved in any student government. Probably, no I don't think so, not then. No is the answer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was there my junior, senior, yeah, sophomore, junior and senior year.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. So--
Speaker 2: This is not a club but, you didn't ask the question, but I spent my summers working in the municipal pools as a lifeguard because the money was pretty good so I then had a summer job doing that. And I had a pretty boring high school. Other than, you know, trying to get ready for the next season.
Story_ID: 613021
Speaker 1: You're in high school from what, '66 [1966] to '70 [1970], right?
Speaker 2: Sixty-nine [1969].
Speaker 1: Sixty-nine [1969], okay, '69 [1969] to--okay, '65 [1965] to '69 [1969] is that what it was?
Speaker 2: Sounds right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sixty-six [1966] to '69 [1969]. Yeah, I graduated in '69 [1969].
Speaker 1: Okay. Was it, was it, were you glad to be in New Jersey for that period of time? I guess so, rather than in Germany, or did it make any difference (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I don't think I knew enough about, I mean I didn't have any preference, it was, we were in Jersey, it was an interesting time because I probably didn't want to move, was--enjoyed doing what I was doing in Germany was doing well athletically and scholastically [at Heidelberg American High School, Heidelberg, Germany]. Jersey because my dad [Huston Jack, Jr.] wasn't around was, I think, a tough adjustment initially, and then the times were also interesting. The latter part of the '60s [1960s] was an interesting time in our nation's history and we got caught up right in the middle of it, both as an observer and also a participant. You went to a public high school [John F. Kennedy High School, Willingboro, New Jersey] and while, compared to other places and other times, it probably was pretty benign, but we had our own issues of, of, I even think about it as drawing sides. You basically had to declare what side of the fence you were on and, at the time and--
Speaker 1: In terms of what issue?
Speaker 2: Of race, of the way I look, you know, people can be, can look at me and say he's Italian or he's Polish or, depending upon what part of the world I travel in, but so it was, it was interesting because, to me I was always African American. None of us were African American in '66 [1966] to '69 [1969]. You were black or you were white, right, but because I was black and being aligned with black students at the time, there were always issues. It was, you know, your basic fight in the cafeteria or argument in the hallway. It was, it was an interesting time.
Speaker 1: Did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My--
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: I was going to say I managed to kind of stay, not above the fray, 'cause I certainly had my own individual situations, but because I was an athlete, you tended to be given, not preferential treatments, probably not the right way to do it, but people didn't mess with you necessarily, but it was definitely a time of picking sides in America.
Speaker 1: You had some notoriety as an athlete then in school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: You were like a, one of the stars of the team?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: But there was some notoriety since you were there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a little.
Speaker 1: Being on the team?
Speaker 2: Yeah, notoriety on the team. No, I was in the middle of the pack, better before my knees went out, but that was part of it.
Story_ID: 613022
Speaker 1: Now did your family discuss the Civil Rights Movement a lot at home or?
Speaker 2: Not really, not during that period of time because my dad [Huston Jack, Jr.] was out of the house, so.
Speaker 1: Now he was in, he was stationed someplace else?
Speaker 2: He was in Park College, Missouri [Park University, Parkville, Missouri], getting his, getting his, finishing his bachelor's degree, and then he came back and I would say that the issues and the conversations probably began more when I was in college [Haverford College, Haverford, Pennsylvania]. And they were probably, the conversations were more with my mother [Johanna Kresse Jack] than with my father about really not understanding what she would call my militancy (laughter). So, I think my father was much more understanding, but my mother would, just couldn't quite understand why, I think that she would say one day I was her little Mikey [HistoryMaker Michael Jack] and the next day I was a militant, but that's an exaggeration, but that's what she would say.
Speaker 1: Okay. You think she just didn't understand some of the racial issues of the United States?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm clear.
Speaker 1: 'Cause it's--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely. I think she, one, didn't understand the issues and two, I think she, at the time, was, despite some of her own issues, probably was much more of an optimist and unfortunately not a realist, and relative to her life, I think, at the time, she was reflecting her world, and I also think that it probably is natural for a mother with a teenager to wake up one morning and be surprised by how this, this person has changed. So whether it's white/black issues or whether it's on issues of, you know, style and taste, and she also didn't understand my long hair and also didn't understand my music, also didn't understand--and I guess I, I wasn't the best communicator either. We were, weren't one to sit around and have long conversations about really anything.
Speaker 1: Now, do you think you were militant then, whatever that means to different people but?
Speaker 2: No, I, I think I, I think I stood up for what I believed in. And I think it was a time when we were vocal about what our beliefs were and it clearly was, you were either black or you're white and there was so much going on in the world that you had to, there was, it seemed in recollection that there was dialogue about this. It was much more of an issue 'cause it was in the headlines. There were things that were going on that made it in the headlines, so did I consider myself a militant? No. I consider myself defending. That's what the term is, you know, people who didn't quite understand, and my mother was probably one of them. Thinking back now, she would say you're as much German as you are black. All right, I get it (laughter).
Speaker 1: What difference does that make in New Jersey, right?
Speaker 2: Right, right, right, right.
Speaker 1: She probably didn't get that part.
Speaker 2: Right. Made a difference in New Jersey, makes a difference every place, makes a big difference.
Story_ID: 613023
Speaker 1: Do you remember what happened in your family and school when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] died in '68 [1968]?
Speaker 2: No, I don't, one, I don't remember what happened in the family and I really don't remember what happened when he died. I don't remember what happened when Malcolm [Malcolm X] died.
Speaker 1: Well, that wasn't publicized as much, that's '65 [1965].
Speaker 2: That was '67 [1967] wasn't it?
Speaker 1: Sixty-five [1965].
Speaker 2: Sixty-five [1965].
Speaker 1: Sixty-five [1965], yeah, like February '65 [1965].
Speaker 2: Yeah, I thought it was '67 [1967], but anyway.
Speaker 1: Yeah, '65 [1965]. But, yeah, and Dr. King was killed in April of '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you would have been a junior in high school [John F. Kennedy High School, Willingboro, New Jersey] I guess. Did your high school have a memorial service or something or anything like that?
Speaker 2: Not that I remember, not that I remember. Did yours?
Speaker 1: I was in college, yeah, the whole school shut down.
Speaker 2: College, yeah.
Speaker 1: With testimonials and stuff, yeah. It was a big deal when it happened. But it's funny how it's different in different parts of the country depending on who's in charge and who's, you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, was your high school mostly white high school?
Speaker 2: You know, I would say, and this is just, I have no idea statistically whether this is correct or not, probably 80/20.
Speaker 1: Eighty percent white?
Speaker 2: Eighty percent white, yeah, 20 percent black. Don't really remember much else. I mean there might have been some Hispanic students, but probably don't recall.
Speaker 1: As far as you know there was no commemoration or anything at school. And your father [Huston Jack, Jr.] was out of town at the time?
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Yep (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. All right.
Story_ID: 613024
Speaker 1: When you were on the verge of graduating [from John F. Kennedy High School, Willingboro, New Jersey], did you know you were going to college at that point?
Speaker 2: Did I know that I was going to go to college?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you have one picked out already at that point?
Speaker 2: I think so. I don't remember there being a lapse.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think I was accepted in a couple of schools and I remember going to this one because it was close and because they gave me a full ride to go there.
Speaker 1: Now was it an academic scholarship or?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, academic scholarship.
Speaker 1: This is Haverford College [Haverford, Pennsylvania], right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: This is in Pennsylvania?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Is it close to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] or Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] or?
Speaker 2: Philadelphia. Yeah, it's about half hour from downtown Philly.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, what was Haverford like?
Speaker 2: Haverford was interesting because it was, it was and still is a very small school. When I was there there was six hundred of us. Now I think it's about a thousand. It is liberal arts school, but founded by Quakers, so it was interesting for me because the high school I went to, again, I guess the number, two thousand to go to this school, which was a small school of six hundred, was culture shock really. It was a good four years but again very different. It was a school that, clearly a liberal arts school, pass fail kind of situation. Wasn't something that I was that familiar with. I was one of, I want to say, twenty-three blacks who joined, joined, that's an army term, who were part of our freshman class, maybe six or eight of us got through it. That was an interesting attrition, but academically very good school and, in many respects a good place to be. In retrospect, it would have been interesting had I gone to a bigger school or different school, you know. I'm not second guessing it, but it clearly was a smaller environment and maybe that's why I was so anxious to get to New York City [New York, New York].
Story_ID: 613025
Speaker 1: So were you initially a political science major in college [Haverford College, Haverford, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: I think so, yeah, I think I probably became a political science major just because. You get there, you start taking classes that are of interest, interest to you and then you end up being a political science major. There was no, no calling, no particular love other than an interest, so.
Speaker 1: Did you have any sense that you might want to be a journalist or something at one, some point (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no. Completely off my radar screen. I thought maybe I might want to be--go into the [U.S.] Foreign Service or might want to be a politician or something like that, but that was, in a weak moment of thinking, what else am I gonna do. The reality was that I knew that I wanted to do something, make some money, and move to New York [New York], or some metropolitan area.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now did you speak pretty good German?
Speaker 2: Not really, I mean I spoke German when I was born and then, because I never used it, I got rusty, very rusty. I can read German, even now, and probably could with a little training be relatively fluent, but that wasn't part of my career plan, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. Now, okay, so were there any teachers or personalities on campus that, you know, are outstanding that you can think back, reflect on?
Speaker 2: Probably one. A professor, his name was Gangadean [Ashok Gangadean] and he taught philosophy.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that name?
Speaker 2: Oh, I couldn't even guess on that one.
Speaker 1: Gangadean?
Speaker 2: G-A--G-A-N-G-A-D-I-E-N [sic.], but--
Speaker 1: He, was--
Speaker 2: Philosophy, go ahead.
Speaker 1: What nationality was he?
Speaker 2: He was Indian, Pakistani, don't really know, but he was one of those really smart, fascinating kind of people who I took a class or two from and for a young man of that age, he was very impressionable. I had never been around anybody like him or seen anybody like him and the notion of philosophy was kind of interesting at the time, and I couldn't tell you what we read and what we did, but I found him to be interesting. I also ended up years later running into his then wife, who lived in New York City, so maybe that's why he had a more lasting impression on me. Other people being, coaches, I played basketball during that period of time. Coach had a not so favorable impression, but he, he had a lasting impression. Yeah, that's, that's pretty much it. It was a interesting time, interesting time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you say you played basketball your freshman year?
Speaker 2: Freshman year, yeah, yeah. Played basketball my freshman year and had my second knee operation, didn't play after that other than intermural basketball, and myself and a couple of other guys quit the team after that freshman year because we didn't like the coach. We ended up playing intermural ball. We would scrimmage with the team afterwards, occasionally, and we basically had a better squad than the, the folks who were remaining simply because of, you could take a year with this coach and that was about it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the other disaffected players, they had to get out of there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. There were two brothers who, great ball--one guy, Chico Ray. I can't remember where Chico came from, somewhere in the South and the other was a guy named John Wallace [ph.] from Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]. I'll never forget the nickname of his high school team, the West Philly Speedboys [West Philadelphia High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]. I always thought that was cool. So we all played intermural ball for a couple of years after that.
Story_ID: 613026
Speaker 1: Did you run for any offices or anything in--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --college, or did you, did the black students form a black student organization.
Speaker 2: (Nods head) I was part of the black student union [Black Student League]. Was, participated in that for the four years that I was there. And, you know, a lot of social activities amongst ourselves.
Speaker 1: Did you pledge a fraternity or anything?
Speaker 2: No. Haverford [Haverford College, Haverford, Pennsylvania] had no fraternities, sororities, nothing like that. Like I said, there were twenty-three of us. That might even be a big number. It might have been less than that when we first came in and then a few each year. A lot of people left. When I first got there, there was, there was a program called post-baccs [post-baccalaureate], where there were students from HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities] who graduated, would come to Haverford for a period of time, six months, a year, something like that, get some additional education, and then move on with a degree, so they were kind of part of that black student union as well. But we clearly were, won't say apart from the university, but certainly we did activities and things that were different. I'll never forget my, (laughter) the graduation night, we ended up meeting to find out who the best bid whist player was (laughter), so we spent our graduation night in a, in a dorm room playing bid whist, until one of the guys stood up on the table with a card, came down and broke the table. That ended the game (laughter).
Speaker 1: Wow, okay. That's graduation night?
Speaker 2: That's graduation night, small school.
Speaker 1: Did the black students there interact with the students at Temple [Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] or Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] or any of the other schools that were close by?
Speaker 2: Not much, not much. I mean they might have. We didn't, other than to go in, you know, we were half hour outside of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], maybe forty-five minutes by train, so I don't recall us getting involved with any kind of intra-university activities.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think sometimes--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know what you mean.
Speaker 1: --students from those schools they party together. The have some kind of interaction (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, no, no. Not, not, not that much. I mean, I knew there was some folks from Cheyney State [Cheyney State College; Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, Cheyney, Pennsylvania] end up at school every once in a while, but I don't ever remember myself jumping in a car and taking off and, and going anyplace, other than to go back home occasionally.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, when you finish school, now did you graduate with honors or anything like that, or?
Speaker 2: I graduated (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah. I don't know that they gave out honors. There wasn't a magna cum laude and all those, but--
Speaker 1: That's right, it was pass/fail.
Speaker 2: It was pass/fail. I clearly wouldn't have graduated with honors. I would have been right there in the middle of the pack.
Story_ID: 613027
Speaker 1: So did you have any plans for graduate school, or did you think about, what would you think you'd do next? What did you wanna do?
Speaker 2: Move to New York City (laughter). I ended up going to New York [New York] because, as I told you, I was at Bryn Mawr [Bryn Mawr College, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania] my junior and senior year--
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: --and--
Speaker 1: Is there anything about that experience that you wanna tell us?
Speaker 2: It was kind of a living arrangement as much as anything because the schools were connected by a bus and so half, I still, while I lived at Bryn Mawr, took half of my classes at both, at Bryn Mawr and half of them at Haverford [Haverford College, Haverford, Pennsylvania]. There was nothing extraordinary about that experience other than my vivid, vivid recollection--a couple of recollections. One was every night, because I had a part time job at the cafeteria, that was part of my work study thing for my, for my tuition, was getting popcorn and sitting in the middle of the, of the dorm with everybody eating popcorn. 'Cause, among other things, as a college student, you're hungry. So my job was to get the popcorn and liberate some butter for the popcorns. The other part was my roommate who, still a friend today, lives in Baltimore [Maryland], was, he managed to convince Bryn Mawr that they ought to create a major around--called ethnomusicology, so his name is Skip Keels. I'm sorry Skip to rat you out, but I've said this to him. And he convinced Bryn Mawr to have this major and he was the only student and it was what it implies, it was music from around the world. Skip was born and raised in Mount Vernon, New York, and we used to, we took our college dorm, let me think if I want my daughter [Truce Jack] to hear all of this, 'cause she's gonna hear this, took my college dorm and we decorated it with leopard bedspreads (laughter), you know, cheap little cotton bedspreads, so we had the things coming down from the ceilings and we had mattresses that we took and we made a couch, so it's one mattress, then another mattress, another, all with leopard bedspreads, and we had our music system in the middle and then we had a little balcony and one of the classes that I took, and maybe Gangadean [Ashok Gangadean] was the teacher, who was mathematical linguistics, which was the, the theory behind math and languages. And there were three of us in the class, and Skip was one of them. It was a different college experience, but it was a, he, he, he and a number of friends, Sherman Smith, who changed his name to Imani [ph.] after he left, but, so most of college was about friends and things we did, and things we can talk about and things we can't talk about. Skip, by the way, left and went to Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], and did a couple of years at Yale, and then he called me one day and said, "I'm going to divinity school." He got accepted to Yale Divinity School [New Haven, Connecticut], and, of all the people in the world that you would think, now I'm not questioning his faith, that, it's never been about his faith, but I was kind of surprised based on his history, that Skip would be going to divinity school. But went on, been a minister or pastor in a number of churches for a number of years and he's, he's a good man, good man.
Story_ID: 613028
Speaker 1: So, anyways, I, while I was at Bryn Mawr [Bryn Mawr College, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania], there was a career day and there was a school that came called Tobe Coburn School of Fashion Marketing [sic. Tobe Coburn School for Fashion Careers; Wood Tobe Coburn School, New York, New York], and they were offering free rides, fellowships, to go to school there and, it was in New York [New York], so I applied and got accepted. So I got there in September of probably 19--what year, must have been '73 [1973], and the school was fashion marketing at the time. If you got through the couple of years that were there, you would then essentially get jobs in the fashion marketing business. For me it was a way to get to New York and I was there for a couple of months. It was interesting (laughter), but it wasn't what I want to do and it wasn't like I was deceiving them, I just, literally I didn't know what I wanted to do. So, part of what they did was put you in different work programs if you wanted during the holiday, the in between semesters and mine was at Bloomingdale's. So I was a, worked in women's cosmetics for a couple of weeks, and my job was to work with the stockmen to make sure that the cosmetics department in Bloomingdale's in 59th Street in New York City, it was stocked. So I did that for a couple of months and then I said, you know, while I appreciate the school and the things that they offer, it's time to get a job. So, I became assistant buyer in women's hosiery.
Speaker 2: Now, this is the same year, in '73 [1973]?
Speaker 1: Sounds right. Could be '74 [1974], yeah, by this time it's probably '74 [1974] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now did you graduated--you had graduated from school [Haverford College, Haverford, Pennsylvania] in '73 [1973]?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right. Okay so, you're in a business now, you're basically--
Speaker 1: Got a job (laughter). Wasn't making any money but I had a job. I spent three years at Bloomingdale's. I started as, as I say, assistant buyer in hosiery. My job was to work with the buyer. I bought women's slippers, so everything from little terrycloth things to Dearborns [sic. Dearfoam] to et cetera. Did that for I think about a year and a half and I was promoted to be a branch department manager in women's shoes. So I did that for about a year, and then I left that, I went to a company called Celanese fiber company [Celanese Corporation] in a marketing job, and my job was to work with manufacturers who were clients of Celanese fiber company. We made polyester. So I would go to large mills and say if you buy more of Celanese fiber, we will give you dollars for your marketing campaigns, and you can take those dollars and you can go to J.C. Penney's [J.C. Penney Company] and you can buy more catalogue space and you can buy more television advertising time or whatever, whatever it was at the time.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right. So where are we now, about 1976, or?
Speaker 1: So, three years, '76 [1976] probably, yeah, probably yeah, '77 [1977].
Story_ID: 613029
Speaker 1: I started at ABC in '77 [1977]. Yep.
Speaker 2: Okay, now how that, how did, did that come about? How did you wind up at ABC?
Speaker 1: I was, during that four or five years after college [Haverford College, Haverford, Pennsylvania], I was in New York [New York]. I was single. I was, had no money, I was living wherever I could, different places, sometimes for free, occasionally, not occasionally, I had different apartments, et cetera. And a couple of the people that were in our social crowd, one was working at ABC at the time and the other one was working also in the business. We would get together once a week, and sometimes, again, playing bid whist, and sitting around one day, one of them says you ought to go for this job that's open in my company and it happened to be ABC. It was a training program and many interviews later, so the reoccurring theme in my life has been bid whist (laughter), opening up and closing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it does, here it is again.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, yeah, and I don't remember the exact moment but clearly that's when it came up and I remember saying, "Nah, I don't want to do that," and both of them encouraging me 'cause they both were in the business. There were precious few African Americans and they happen to be two African American females at a time when there was hardly any of us in the business, so.
Speaker 2: Okay. So you went right into, so what aspect of training, was it a management training or (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was a, it was a sales training program.
Speaker 2: Sales training program.
Speaker 1: It was to become a salesperson. It was to sell advertising time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So this was in '77 [1977], so I was a trainee for three to six months something like that. Then I became a salesperson. So, I called on ad agencies and clients in New York City for the ABC station in New York [WABC-TV, New York, New York] where I then sold them advertising time.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right. Now you have a nice resonate voice. I don't know if you had it then, but did you, was it ever any, were you ever tempted or drafted to do anything on air?
Speaker 1: Not really, no, no. I think it's resonating because of the story I told you earlier about getting in late from meetings from Chicago [Illinois]. No, never had the urge, never, certainly have done some things but they've all been related to a specific thing for work, do some things now, but no never anything like that.

Speaker 1: What did you learn about television sales? I mean what are we, you know we're talking about, I guess, big advertisers spend a lot of money--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --first of all.
Speaker 2: What did I learn about 'em?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, I learned that it's certainly a competitive business. It was then and even more so now. It's a different world. When I first joined, we had essentially five competitors. Worked for ABC, there was NBC, CBS, pre-FOX, so you could count your competitors in one hand. People were watching television. The one station in New York [WABC-TV, New York, New York], when I was there averaged twenty, twenty-two rating. Now all the TV stations in New York, you add them all up, probably average a ten, twelve rating. I'm talking about all of them, so a different world. It was, it's always been a numbers based kind of sale. It's also been selling audiences, how many people are watching TV. It's always been one where as a new person on the block, my job was to take all the accounts that nobody else wanted and to grow those accounts, so a lot of it was hustling, a lot of it was developing relationships, a lot of it was trying to outsmart the competition by being, don't want to use the word strategic, it had nothing to do with it. It was really just trying to show customers that we had the best programming.
Story_ID: 613031
Speaker 1: What was the most popular program in terms of sales, selling time on (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At that time?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I think this was the days of, I don't know the exact, 'Happy Days,' 'Love Boat' ['The Love Boat'], 'Mork and Mindy,' those kinds of shows.
Speaker 1: Situation comedies.
Speaker 2: Situation comedies.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: By far. This was, we had turmoil when 'Roots' came out, it was, I was--
Speaker 1: Seventy-seven [1977]. That was the year you started that you started out (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, that was the year that 'Roots' came out because I remember that was big. I was trying to remember what, how I was involved with sales. I know it was at ABC. There were a few of those things that were big at the time, those miniseries kind of events happened then, tough to, economies to scale don't work anymore for that on television, but those were popular. The Olympics, ABC was involved with the Olympics also.
Speaker 1: Last night [HistoryMaker] Quincy Jones mentioned 'Roots' and how the network had decided to run it for eight weeks at first and then decided to consolidate it into eight consecutive nights, the first time that had ever been done.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any discussions about that and the, in terms of sales and what that meant for--
Speaker 2: Not really. I remember being incredibly, just incredibly awed by it. I mean it was, it was so wonderfully positive and it was huge (laughter). It was a big kaleidoscopic television event and it was hard to get out of the way of that, you know. It was very, it was as we all know, very positive thing. I don't really remember the sales implications. I probably didn't have any accounts that could afford to be in it.
Speaker 1: Now these (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Then again I don't think anybody ever thought it would be as successful as it was.
Story_ID: 613032
Speaker 1: How diverse was WABC [WABC-TV, New York, New York] in those days in terms of the set. Here you come on as an intern, I know all the corporations and big companies were committed to some kind of internship program then that they responded to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right. Yeah, I was a token minority. It, it was myself and the woman, Darlene Johnson [ph.], who was my card playing buddy, who was the person who told me about this. God, I hadn't thought about her for years. Not diverse at all.
Speaker 1: Okay. So it's two of you out of a staff of how many people maybe?
Speaker 2: Probably ten, twelve.
Speaker 1: Okay. This is at WABC, the local affiliate at New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Did WABC produce any local, I mean other than the news, were there any local shows that you had to sell time, you know, are you selling time for?
Speaker 2: I'm sure there were, there were definitely some public affairs shows. How much we sold of that, I don't know. I think, just kind of, I think 'Tony Brown's Journal,' you mentioned that earlier, was done at WABC at the time, but that wasn't a local production. So, we may have done something, nothing that burns in my mind as something that was particularly significant.
Story_ID: 613033
Speaker 1: Well, how were treated at WABC [WABC-TV, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I was treated okay, you know. I was moderately successful, successful enough to get promoted. Went to, the next job was in Chicago [Illinois]. You were a local salesperson for a while, then you, then you were promoted, if you were promoted to the next job and et cetera. I guess I'll answer the question this way. Throughout any career working for most of Corporate America, and I don't mean to generalize, but I'm gonna do it, because we are in America. To answer the question about how I was treated, there are always people that when I walk through the door, will see an African American man first and everything else second. So I don't think there is such a thing as being colorblind in America, I think it's, it's a very real thing that is the first thing that comes through the door. So, were there individuals that didn't treat me as well as I thought I should be treated? Yes. Were there people that could have been more instrumental in moving me faster? Absolutely. Were there situations that may have happened that could have helped my career move faster? Absolutely. Some of them self-imposed (laughter). I've told the story so I'm not speaking out of (unclear). I'll never forget, for instance, the first time we had a client party in New York [New York]. They said there was this safari theme and everybody shows up in Dockers and polo shirts and khakis and I had a kaftan (laughter). And oh, I also brought a date. They said it was a party and it was safari theme, and not, not probably the smartest thing you wanna do in Corporate America if you're interested in accelerating quickly.
Speaker 1: So you were defiant as a, you wanted to--
Speaker 2: You know, I was just stupid, I was just stupid. It wasn't, this was not one of those in your face moments. This was just one of those naive, I didn't know. You talk about, you asked me earlier about having people in your life who are counselors and confidantes and I had none of that in my life.
Speaker 1: This is psychologically, you think of the psychology of this. They hold a safari theme party. They dress like big game hunters and such and people on safari. You come as an African.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Which you are though, and I mean, in terms of identity (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Thank you.
Speaker 1: --and what you're identifying with.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So I don't know. I mean I--
Speaker 2: Yeah, now, but, but it wasn't, there had been other times in my life I've made statements. This was not one of those statement moments. This was really one of those moments of naivety. Like I say, I shot myself in the foot in that particular situation. I would, I would, I talk to young men and women all the time about the things that you do and you don't do and it's never about assimilation. It's never about not being yourself. It's never about turning your back on who you are, but there're things that you need to be smart about. Their bat, their ball, et cetera, so.
Story_ID: 613034
Speaker 1: So I was telling you a couple of self-inflicted wounds (laughter), 'cause you were asking about how I felt people at ABC treated me and I really was talking just in general about some experience in Corporate America, but back to that period of time, I was, 'cause I was making very little money, was also selling suits at night at a store called Barneys [Barneys New York], so I, I, after saving Barneys discount, I bought a silk tan jacket. I was sharp and proud. It was the first time, other than a blue blazer that I bought at Bloomingdale's that I actually bought something and I rode down the elevator with the president of the division at that time. And I had on some dress sandals. I don't know if you recall the type that where, you had kind of slits in 'em but I was looking sharp.
Speaker 2: Huaraches they're called, I think, or something like that.
Speaker 1: Not huaraches, but a little more dressy than that and I was, I thought I was looking bad, so, up in the elevator with him. Riding down the elevator, he says, looks over at me and says something about the jacket. And I said, "You like it? Well come on down to Barney's, I'll hook you up. I'll give you a little discount," et cetera. The next day, the next day, there was a memo that came out that all account managers, salespeople who worked for ABC will wear suits or at the--in casual moments, blue blazers, so, so should I have been smarter? Probably. Had I been there longer, maybe the outcome would have been different. But it clearly was, we were on different pages. Had I worked at the time for a different company maybe the outlook would have been different.
Speaker 2: You were actually thinking that he wanted one of 'em.
Speaker 1: Oh, absolutely. I, and I was gonna hook him up. And he was looking at me as, who is this crazy fool riding down the elevator, thinking he's looking sharp, et cetera, et cetera. There haven't been many situations like this, but I remember distinctly one that I know, as I was doing it, it was not the smartest thing to do, but I wonder had the same conversation happened between two white males, if the outcome had been the same, so. Not a bad outcome 'cause I didn't get fired, but we were at a dinner, I can't remember if it was a client dinner or one of just ABC personnel at the time, and one of the guys who happens to have the job that I now have, was sitting at the table with me, along with, I think it was the president of the division, another guy at the time. This is a number of years later, and the conversation came up about country clubs, and we got into this debate about why he thought it appropriate that you could exclude African Americans from country clubs. And I, I just, his rationale was, well because it's private. And I remember distinctly saying, and it stopped the conversation. "So, let me understand this, so it's okay to discriminate in public--in private, but not in public? Is that what you're saying?" So, all in all this world is comprised of people who, despite seeing color as the first thing that walks in the door, is how we deal with each other. Some people never get past that initial reaction and some people do, so, to generalize, I've been successful. Could I have been more successful earlier if I had been evaluated only for the things that hopefully I am evaluating individuals for, competency and performance and those kinds of things, maybe, probably, but this is America.
Story_ID: 613035
Speaker 1: You went to Chicago [Illinois] in 1980, I guess, right, to--?
Speaker 2: Went to Chicago in '80 [1980].
Speaker 1: Was that to WLS [WLS-TV, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No, I went to the ABC rep firm. So sold locally and then sold in Chicago nationally for a rep firm that ABC owned at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And worked there for a year.
Speaker 1: Okay. So then what happened after that year?  Where did you (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Cough) Excuse me. Then I was promoted to San Francisco [California] as a, as a national sales manager for the ABC station in San Francisco, also owned by ABC. It was KGO [KGO-TV, San Francisco, California]. I was there for five years, one as national sales manager, four as local sales manager. (Laughter) I want to go back to Chicago for one second, just to kind of, another one of those shoot yourself in the foot kind of moments that turned out okay. The guy who hired me for the job said, "Shave your beard." I said, "What do you mean shave my beard?" "Shave your beard. I'm not gonna give you this job unless you shave your beard." True story. I said, "I'm not gonna shave my beard. Why should I shave my beard?" So I, I thought back about this but people have asked me, how long have you had your beard and I guess it goes back to whatever year that was, 1980, and he remembers the last rationale was, you know there's never been a sales manager at ABC that's had a beard, and I said, "Well I guess there may not ever be, 'cause I'm not shaving my beard." Anyways, it worked out okay. A year later I was the sales manager in San Francisco. So I was out there five years, local sales manager, which means--national, which means I was responsible for national sales for the, outside of San Francisco for that station at the time, and then moved to local where I was responsible for a team of salespeople, sold to ad agencies in San Francisco.
Story_ID: 613036
Speaker 1: Is there, there a particular philosophy of salesmanship that you learned that you can share with us?
Speaker 2: Yeah, get the order (laughter). But you asked me earlier about what phrases I use, there's a couple of phrases. I was working for a guy, I find myself repeating it a number of times. One is, "Get the cash." At the end of the day, no excuses, get the cash, get the order. Another one, he was a pretty smart guy, very eclectic, but very smart guy. Still in contact with him. He used to have a sign that he'd put up and the sign would say think it through. Just think it through. He would, salespeople have a tendency, I guess we all do, wanna take our problems and put it on somebody else. Well, he would have this sign, put it up, think it through. Not that it--shutting down conversations, just wants you to think through what the issue is. And ultimately come up with a plan. What's your plan is something else that I will say, even to this day, a lot. Here are the circumstances, what's your plan, trying to get input from different people, but that wasn't your question. So, about philosophy of sales, philosophy is, there was a philosophy, I don't think it varies, doesn't, it kind of works no matter what the industry. Work hard, know your product, like I say all the time. Product knowledge, you gotta have product knowledge, no matter what it is, whether you're a reporter or whether you're a salesperson or whether you're a, you got to know your product. Certainly outwork your completion. You gotta be smart, you gotta be smart enough to be analytical when necessary, and know your customers. So, a job that also doesn't lend itself, if you've got a, if you're thin skinned probably not a good place to be. You tend to, in many cases, fail more than you succeed, so you've got to be able to deal with that kind of, that kind of a challenge to your ego, but.
Speaker 1: Okay, but that's--all right. Now, so in terms of knowing the product, so you would have to be knowledgeable of the programs and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --who was in on what they were, you know--
Speaker 2: The good ones would be knowledgeable of who's in the programs. The ones, meaning salespeople, unfortunately, since we're dealing with audience numbers and we're dealing with ad agencies and a lot of our business has become commoditized, where it is based off of ratings that are done by Neilson rating services [Nielsen Media Research].
Speaker 1: Basic Neilson right?
Speaker 2: Yep. So whether you're selling stocks and bonds or whether you're selling insurance premiums, we've made, we've commoditized the business and you can do that as a salesperson, the good ones go beyond that to, you know you give life and personality (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, that's the bottom line that you're saying for most sales, is a--
Speaker 2: Yep. No question. Get the cash (laughter), get the money.
Speaker 1: --is the ratings of the show really. If the show is highly rated, content becomes less important--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely. The people who are buying media, it's, it's changed with the advent of things like the Internet, where people now are, are, know much more clearly what they're spending their advertising dollars on and what the return on their investment is, than they did thirty years ago when I was in business, but it's a broad spectrum of different types of sales, different types of things, but there's still far too much reliance on the statistical part of it as opposed to the substantive part of it. But the good salesperson is able to do both.
Story_ID: 613037
Speaker 1: In the days that you were selling, I think, correct me if I'm wrong, I think there were more, there was more black programming on the major networks than it is right now, I believe.
Speaker 2: It varies with the year. There was no UPN [United Paramount Network], UPN, niche programming appealed to African Americans, et cetera, et cetera and so, it, it--
Speaker 1: In those days it was no UPN, you had ABC, CBS, NBC.
Speaker 2: That's right, so there wasn't more black programming. There really has, because of diversity of channels, there, believe it or not, is more, it just isn't, doesn't seem to be more. But, having said that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The fact is, it wasn't a whole lot then, it wasn't a whole lot in the middle, meaning fifteen years ago, and it isn't a whole lot now.
Speaker 1: Okay. Do, did advertisers hardly, ever at all concern themselves with the content of a show regardless of its ratings, no?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there are exceptions. You get premiums for programs that reach a certain niche, however you define that niche. If you're, obviously if you're in the business of selling diapers, you're more interested in programs that happen to skew towards moms or families. If you're interested in selling Porsches, you're interested in programming that reaches upscale households that are disposed, so the research is there to allow you to do that. So there are certain programs that go to one side, one niche that you are able to get premium pricing for, but there are a vast majority of programs that are somewhere in the middle and it's really I, he who has the most eyeballs wins. And some are on the spectrum, they're also the favorites of, if a chairman of American Express [American Express Company] for instance, loves a program and there's an ad agency that represents American Express, I would venture to say that that program probably would be bought regardless of what the eyeballs are. But that's, you know that's an extreme example. I'm probably kidding more than I really know that that happens.
Story_ID: 613038
Speaker 1: As you were moving up in the ranks at, at ABC, did you ever think, well, you know, I mean, nowadays I guess you'd advise or people advise, those who want to rise like that to get an M.B.A. or some, or get some degree in some kind of business degree or something. And you're a political science man moving up (laughter) in sales, I mean, is there, is it better to have the experience or the--
Speaker 2: Or the degree?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I tell people this all the time, get the job. The only time anybody cares anything about where you went to school is your first job, or an alumni. If you run across somebody that happened to go to your school and they're hiring, they'll give you a little advantage there, but I don't think this is, this is not an industry that values M.B.A.'s or Ph.D.'s. It's what have you done, what can you do for me, and how quickly can you do it is really the most important thing, so. I always tell people if you're passionate about something, go for it. So you wanna have two Ph.D.'s do it if that's what you need to fulfill your dream. But it's not something that's gonna get you the next job.
Story_ID: 613039
Speaker 1: We had you in San Francisco [KGO-TV, San Francisco, California]. We're about 1985 now, 1984?
Speaker 2: Eighty-one [1981] through '86 [1986].
Speaker 1: Okay, '86 [1986] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: All right. Now anything from that experience you want to share with us?
Speaker 2: You know, a lot of traveling, a lot of, a lot of, a lot of good times, a couple of difficult times, other few examples I don't want to go into about the bad side of Corporate America that I experienced, and ended up in Los Angles [California], promoted to the next job, which was to run the national office for ABC in, in L.A., on the sales side, so.
Speaker 1: That's a, sounds like a, sounds like a big position. That sounds like a big deal, you know.
Speaker 2: It was probably, probably sounds like a bigger deal than it was. It was the next evolution if you will. So I had both kinds of sales manager experience for a local TV station. Now instead of selling one station, it was selling the ten stations that NBC owned, NBC, ABC owned at the time. I was in that job for ten years, which was probably five years too long, and it was really a result of, ABC was bought by a company called Cap Cities [Capital Cities Communications, Inc.; Disney ABC Television Group] and the movement that happened at ABC, they were moving people around based off of jobs and (unclear), just stopped, so I was in a job that I enjoyed. It was selling in Los Angeles and managing people, tough job for, as I say, five years too long because of the lack of movement. I had an opportunity to go to NBC to take the next job, but was talked out of it really by ABC with kind of a promise to get the job similar to that when that job came up. The job came up, I was gon- and didn't get it and I was gone within a month, so I left ABC to go to NBC as vice president in sales for KNBC [KNBC-TV, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Now what year is this?
Speaker 2: That, so let's go '86 [1986] to '96 [1996], sounds right, so I went to ABC in '96 [1996]--NBC in '96 [1996].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, interesting, interesting time. A tough decision to leave ABC where I'd been almost twenty years, felt that, while not given a written guarantee, that I was disappointed that I didn't get that job, but I was, well, should have been mine. Could cry a lot of fouls but at the end of the day, it's their bat, their ball, they chose somebody else to take the job. ABC, and this is true industrywide, there are few of us, ever have been, over thirty years both in the sales arena in management, it's been difficult to, on the sales side and really in the management ranks, the numbers have been bad and continue to be bad. End up at KNBC in Los Angeles, ran the sales department there, three years terrific opportunity, good run there, and then I left that to--was promoted to the general manager of WCMH [WCMH-TV] in Columbus [Ohio], which was at the time owned by NBC. So I was president and general manager of the station there for three years and then moved here [WRC-TV, Washington, D.C.] five years ago.
Story_ID: 613040
Speaker 1: Any stories from Columbus? Or how was that? You go from the West Coast where you've been for over a decade to--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --Columbus, Ohio (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Stories, yeah, stories in Columbus. The, the, Columbus was interesting because it was, if there was anything, you would ask me to think about a kind of why political science, I never quite knew why political science, I knew I wanted to move to New York [New York] (laughter). I said that a couple of times. I, I knew I wanted something bigger, but one of the things I really did know was that when I joined the industry I wanted to be a general manager of a TV station. That's what I knew. So, Columbus really was the final step for me and it was pretty exciting. Now, my wife is from Columbus.
Speaker 1: Now had you met her--were you already with her?
Speaker 2: I had met her, met her in L.A. [Los Angeles, California]. She had left Columbus to come to L.A. and we started dating so I thought this would be a great thing to come home and say we're moving back to Columbus. Well, unfortunately, for her it was a little been there, done that. So she was going back to a town she had left a number of years ago. And, you know, she adjusted. She found her way. That was wonderful being around her family. They're still in the Columbus area and just wonderful sisters and brothers and, so that part was terrific. I think we had a, a daughter at the time. Truce [Truce Jack] was born in L.A.
Speaker 1: Now that's an interesting name. I think I've--
Speaker 2: Truce.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Truce as a name for a baby. Now is there a story behind that name?
Speaker 2: It was a very brief story. We, we, we were talking about names and Mary [Mary Jack], my wife, said, "What about Truce?" I said, "Truce, where does that--?" She said there was somebody she knew in high school, and I said, "Let me see, Truce. If it's Truce and it's a boy, he could be a linebacker, okay, the Truce. And if it's a girl, Truce, I kind a like that." So, as an ambidextrous kind of name, so Truce it was, and we probably decided within two or three minutes. Now Truce, on the other hand, while today she, I'm sure, likes the name. As a ten year old, and I'm sure there're gonna be times in her life when people are teasing her, but she's gonna come back and say, "My parents, man, why'd they ever call me." But, before I even go into Columbus, L.A. was interesting for Truce, because of Truce. She was born at twenty-four weeks. So she was a pound eleven at birth so she was a super preemie, and spent three months in the hospital and six months on oxygen, so it was a really, really tough period. We, things were touch and go there, and I got, it's, it's a, if you've ever known anybody who's gone through that experience, it's no fun, but the good news at the time I was working for a woman who was my boss, who was the general manager of KNBC [KNBC-TV, Los Angeles, California] at the time, went on to be chairman of Lifetime [Lifetime Entertainment Services, LLC], a woman named Carole Black, and she, I'll never forget, I was in L.A., excuse me in New York on business, and flying back, found out, raced to the hospital and she was there before me, so to this day we're still close, and in touch and she's also my daughter's godmother. That was a very interesting and trying period of time. I know you asked me about Columbus, but just going back to my L.A. days, they were wonderful times outside of work. Nothing wrong with work by the way, it was just, like I said, I thought they probably could have moved faster and probably should have left the company a little earlier, but great group of friends, folks that we met and to this day some of our closest friends are in L.A. Mary had a, Mary had a fiftieth birthday in March of this year. We flew to Columbus, had a party in Columbus for all friends and family there and got on a plane and did the same thing in L.A. the next day so, so kind of a family. My folks are still there, mother [Johanna Kresse Jack] and father [Huston Jack, Jr.]. So it's still, I'd say we probably have our closest friends in Los Angeles.
Story_ID: 613041
Speaker 1: All right, now Columbus [Ohio].
Speaker 2: Um-hm, so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now you're general manager--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --of WCMH [WCMH-TV, Columbus, Ohio].
Speaker 2: CMH.
Speaker 1: That's the local NBC--
Speaker 2: Affiliate.
Speaker 1: --affiliate. Okay, all right. Now how is that different from what you've done before?
Speaker 2: Well, it's the first time I had full responsibility for a P and L [profit and loss] of an entire station. It was the first time I had direct responsibility for news, advertising promotion, community, et cetera, so I had the sales part down. And while I was involved with a bunch of community events throughout my career, always doing something, this was, yeah, the first time it all rolled up through me.
Speaker 1: Okay. At the time were there many community affairs programs at the station? I ask that 'cause (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) None that we produced.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, is the answer. We did a bunch of news. We do forty, over forty hours of news here in Washington [D.C.]. We were probably clocking about thirty-two hours a week in Columbus. We didn't do any public affairs program per se.
Speaker 1: Okay. You know, how do you feel about that in the sense of the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] kind of relaxing all of the mandates for public affairs programming or getting rid of 'em basically.
Speaker 2: The, public affairs programming is interesting and television in general is interesting. I think I'd feel differently if we were in television in 1977 versus television in the year 2007, five, seven choices, a thousand choices. Television has become niche programming. The audiences that we have today, we're the number one TV station in Washington [WRC-TV, Washington, D.C.], are significantly less than they were ten years ago and less than they were twenty years ago. So, specifically as it relates to public affairs, there are channels and networks for that venue and then there are broadcasters. You, you, you don't have to be everything to everybody. You need to service your community and to do long form public affairs programming is, while laudable, not necessarily necessary, I think, to be able to have, to give, you know, divergent opinions within the community of voice. I guess there are other ways to do that.
Story_ID: 613042
Speaker 1: We were talking off camera about the nature of what you're doing, you were saying that in terms of my concern about public affairs programming, that only 7 percent of the programming nowadays is on the air.
Speaker 2: Is over the air (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is over the air. That rest is cable, right?
Speaker 2: That people receive via the antenna, in this area, and there are some areas that are even less, the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California] for instance. Everybody's wired there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so then the presumption is that people would get, would have access to, well cable access channels who carry public affairs shows and then any other niche you kind of--programing would be carried on some other cable channel. Is that pretty much it?
Speaker 2: I mean, I think that's somewhat of a generalization but that's relatively fair. People, people unfortunately don't watch a lot of that programming either (laughter). We do some shows here, one called 'A Reporter's Notebook' [sic. 'Reporter's Notebook'] and another called 'Viewpoint' about a single topic with folks within the community talking about issues that are important here the Washington [D.C.] area, so we do give a voice to it. And the good news is we've locked it in between Sunday morning programming and what's happening in the world is people are waking up earlier and those now become very highly rated areas, but beyond that, you know, I think the domain of public affairs programming is no different than the domain of any other programming you know. People, there are so many different things that people are doing, so many distractions, so many multitask these days that finding audiences for programming is difficult in the broadcast business, but a lot of it's going online. We talk all the time. Our competition is not ABC and CBS and FOX, its Google [Google Inc.] and Yahoo and that's where the world is today. I spent a lot of time talking about how to grow our business on all the multiplatforms that exist. We're content providers but we've got to have the content where people want to watch it and we're, watch and use it. It's a different world than it was thirty years ago.
Speaker 1: We were discussing too that NBC 4 [WRC-TV, Washington, D.C.] here is not a superstation like WGN [WGN-TV, Chicago, Illinois] or WOR [WOR-TV; WWOR-TV, Secaucus, New Jersey] used to be or TBS [Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.], but what you do here, you do, you shoot programs for national distribution here like 'George Michael Sports Machine' ['The George Michael Sports Machine'] used to. Is that still being produced here?
Speaker 2: That was cancelled in March of this year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We took it off the air. It had been on for twenty-five years, but we do do here, of course, 'Matthews Show' ['The Chris Matthews Show'], 'Meet the Press,' a show called 'It's Academic' that has a regional place. It's a high school--kind of like 'Jeopardy' for high school competitions. We do--
Speaker 1: 'McLaughlin' ['The McLaughlin Group'] is here.
Speaker 2: 'McLaughlin' is done out of here, done out of our studios, yeah, downstairs.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, yeah this was like, you know, once we drove up here I mean, I, I been to a few stations, but I've never seen as many antennas, and (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, right. We also have a few MSNBC shows and CNBC down here. It's also the network news bureau, so Tim Russert is the managing editor of NBC News in Washington, so we share the same building.
Story_ID: 613043
Speaker 1: So what's the, is there, is there, any longer a challenge, I guess, any kind of a racial barrier, a challenge to being a general manager of a, of a station like this [WRC-TV, Washington, D.C.] in the United States today?
Speaker 2: Is there a racial barrier, meaning is it more difficult to do my job because I'm an African American then where I am--I hate to be so simplistic about it, but I'll go back to what I said, it's the first thing that people see when I walk through the door. Now, some may see an Italian or a Greek or whatever until they know that I'm African American, it's the first thing that people see. This is America. And, having said that though, I think we are in such a competitive business that ultimately people in this position will evaluate me for what I do versus who I am, meaning ethnically, meaning if I am more successful, if my ratings, if our ratings continue to grow, et cetera now will that, will there be a time if I move onto the next job that somebody won't go back to knowing when I walk through the door that they're evaluating me for this next job along with somebody else and not saying I'm evaluating African American male versus, will that influence that decision? I don't know. I'd, I'd like to think that people will say this is, this is what he and his teams have accomplished. But that might be naive. It doesn't--being an African American male in Washington, D.C. is not a unique proposition. Being a African American male in, in Wyoming, being a general manager, probably would be more difficult. Being a African American now being a general manager in the television business is still an anomaly. I used to, you remember the Richard Pryor routine about who's in jail, just us right. I used to--
Speaker 1: That's the justice we get.
Speaker 2: Thank you. And for years kept my just us list trying to track African American general managers in the business, and numbers go up, they go down, the last ten years have been ten, twelve, thirteen of us. Now you're talking 220 TV markets around the country times seven or ten stations in each of those markets. It's, the numbers are just appalling. The good news is NBC, when I first got the job, we owned fourteen stations at the time. This will sound like a commercial for NBC, it's probably meant to be. Of the fourteen stations, there were four African American general managers and six of our news directors were African American. Now, that's changed. Today it's just me because acquisition--well, we sold two of the stations and unfortunately lost two of us. My counterpart in Los Angeles [California] was promoted to the job of vice president of diversity, exclusively. Up until a couple of months ago, she was the present general manager of KNBC [KNBC-TV] in Los Angeles and vice president of diversity for NBC, which is a job that I had. We had talked about that earlier, you know, being vice president of diversity for NBC and general manager of the station for four years. As we've grown, with the acquisition of Telemundo, and Universal [NBCUniversal], and all the, you know, the theme parks and it, it just became a job that needed the unique and individual attention of one person as opposed to being, it was just too much for one person to handle, doing both jobs. So, not sure how I got off on that tangent, but--
Story_ID: 613044
Speaker 1: We didn't talk about that, we should have talked about being vice president of diversity [at NBC], you, there's some statements on the net [Internet] attributed to you about, you know, the diversity in the programming at NBC and, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh really, what did they say (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Well, there was one, it's a critique of 'Friends,' I think the show 'Friends,' you know successful show, but no black people on it whatsoever.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, that's a, that's a truism. It was certainly one of the challenges, there was a lot of challenges that exist in trying to change this battleship of having too little representation in front and behind the camera, but the, the unique challenge with 'Friends' was success. It was one thing to say you weren't doing well and you ought to do better because it's the right thing to do. It's another thing to say you ought to do something else because you can do better because you're not succeeding. 'Friends' unfortunately was a situation where it was a very successful show with an all-white cast that when asked the question, what do you think you should do, do you dump one of the characters and substitute it for a minority actor. Well, the reality is there probably were plenty of opportunities to broaden the group, but here was something that was working imminently well and plenty of other pastures that needed to be sown (laughter) than take on that challenge of, of 'Friends,' that actually was a pretty solid show well before I got there.
Story_ID: 613045
Speaker 1: Now you are an unlikely success story as somebody from political science, a political scientist would like at this and say here's a black graduate of Haverford [Haverford College, Haverford, Pennsylvania], which is, you know, and a political science major, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --it seems unlikely that you would be in the position you're in today. What do you attribute to the success you have?
Speaker 2: What do I attribute the success I've had to? I think, first and foremost, hard work, luck in some cases. I say this to people and I really do mean it, the difference between me and them, and I'm surrounded by some very talented people, is I just got there a little earlier, I'm a little older and had one or two people on the way, think that I was okay enough and doing an okay enough job, so I don't think it's anything that is unique. This whole notion--not particularly good on self-promotion, but I would say that if I do anything while I enjoy what I do, I enjoy people, I enjoy life (laughter), I enjoy my job and work hard to just constantly try to be, kind of sounds like a cliche, the best you can be without wearing that uniform, although at one point I thought I might thought I wanted to go to West Point [United States Military Academy, West Point, New York]. So it's just application you know. And a little luck along the way.
Story_ID: 613046
Speaker 1: Now we always ask this question. What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: The broader community or the community in broadcasting or?
Speaker 1: Well, the African American community (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well the concerns are the obvious ones, the impact of drugs in the community, poor broken educational systems, the plight of African American males in prison, this whole, you know, this whole culture of hopelessness that too many young men and women are engaged in. It's, the, this anvil of oppression and how to get out of that cycle, how, how can we succeed when so many of our youth are disenfranchised with no path, no vision, no direction to get out of it. That concerns me. Professionally, I'm always concerned, I've always been involved with trying to increase the representation of minorities, although I'm obviously biased (laughter), in Corporate America. We got to get more of us in and that, that concerns me. The notion of aspirations, what was it? I'm sorry, I forgot the--
Speaker 1: Ask you--
Speaker 2: The hopes?
Speaker 1: Yeah, your hopes and concerns for the black community.
Speaker 2: Yeah. My hopes is that we can figure it all out, that we find a way to make it truly a level playing field, that we can get to a point where we do, where we're the norm, not the exception.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'll take 13 percent (laughter). You know one of the, just going back a second about my own diversity as vice president [vice president of diversity for NBCUniversal], we, when I have conversations about quotas, I'd always say, metrics and people like to define things, since quotas is no longer appropriate, tell me about how, how do you then measure success. There are different ways of looking at that, so finally I just went, the end of the argument, okay, just give me 13 percent. Give me what we are in America. Give me equal proportion. I'll be happy with that as a start. Anyways.
Story_ID: 613047
Speaker 1: One thing I didn't ask you, I didn't ask you about the moment of transition from Columbus [Ohio] to D.C. [Washington, D.C.]. I mean how, how did you, you know, tell us about that transition from being general manager of the station in Columbus [WCMH-TV] to becoming general manager here [WRC-TV, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: In what respect?
Speaker 1: Well, how--
Speaker 2: What happened?
Speaker 1: Yeah, what happened?
Speaker 2: The job came up, my predecessor went to San Francisco [California]. I raised my hand, said I'm interested. I was working with the same guy. In a couple of weeks it happened, and in coming here, I also then became vice president of diversity [for NBCUniversal], which I was supposed to do for a year, end up doing for four years, so really wasn't much more to that story than that. It's just kind of the next, it was a bigger market.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I've always wanted to come to D.C. Just love living in the nation's capital.
Story_ID: 613048
Speaker 1: Now do you have a future aspiration, you know, maybe to go to New York [New York] or someplace, or even bigger market for you?
Speaker 2: This is not my last stop. I just don't know what my next stop is. I really don't, I don't want to, I don't want my boss' job, I can't see myself playing more a corporate role. I like being an operator. I like, you know, mixing it up. I like doing the things that I do. I love, I'm involved with many, many boards here in Washington [D.C.] and a lot of community activity, a bunch of things. You get into those corporate jobs and they become different animals there, while there's certainly scoping your range is bigger, a lot of them are finance driven and we, we're in a world today that is very, very challenged from the top to the bottom line. So I don't know what I want to do next. I can't imagine though that this will be my last stop. And it wouldn't be out of boredom, not a day that I wake up and ever say, oh, my goodness I got to come to work today. I enjoy it usually, walk in with ten things to do and walk out with ten more things to do.
Story_ID: 613049
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You mentioned some volunteer activities and boards that you serve on, I heard you talking earlier about 100 Black Men [100 Black Men of America, Inc.].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I mean what, what are some of the volunteer activities that you're in, engaged in?
Speaker 2: Well with the 100, I've been involved with the 100 since Columbus [Ohio]. Then the Urban League, Washington Urban League [Greater Washington Urban League, Washington, D.C.], sit on that board. The Boys and Girls Club [Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Washington, Washington, D.C.], the, a couple of trade organizations, one the D.C. Chamber of Commerce [District of Columbia Chamber of Commerce], the board of trade [Greater Washington Board of Trade], which is a trade organization that rather than just specifically D.C. [Washington, D.C.], it oversees, not oversees, it's a trade organization for the, the regents of Maryland, Virginia and D.C. Ad Week D.C. [Advertising Week D.C.], which is an annual event that kind of celebrates advertising in Washington. I'm on the steering committee there. There are eight of 'em. Want me to look at my calendar, I'll tell you, 'cause there's generally a couple of things I'm doing each week. I missing one or two.
Speaker 1: That's good. I mean it gives us an idea.
Speaker 2: Enough. It keeps you hopping between a ten year old [Truce Jack] and being a father is very, very important to me. I try to stay active and involved with her life and chasing her around from one activity to the next activity and staying involved with the different organizations that I'm involved with, and trying to be a good husband [to Mary Jack], it's a pretty full day.
Story_ID: 613050
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned earlier some things you wish you hadn't of done, but we always ask this question anyway.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Are there, when you look back at everything you've done, are there any major things you would do differently if you could do 'em again.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there are two things. I mentioned one. I would have left ABC earlier, and the other thing that I would have done was to have more children. I, I was married the second time, married once for five years, and actually married on paper for five years, lived together for a year in the same city, we were in different cities. It worked fine until we lived in the same city (laughter). But now, I'm happily married this time around and never really had any desire to be a father, and like my life, like living in New York [New York], L.A. [Los Angeles, California], Chicago [Illinois], just running hard all the time, just enjoying life. And then, as I got a little older, and Mary [Jack's second wife, Mary Jack] is a wonderful woman with a gazillion nieces and nephews who are dear to our hearts, while she never really made it an issue, it just became pretty apparent that she wouldn't have been fulfilled without a child, and so then we actively began and soon thereafter Truce [Truce Jack] was born, and, are you a father? Then you know. Nothing like it. So, unfortunately, because I told you about the whole issue of her being very, very premature and just getting older. So that would be my one regret that I didn't have more children earlier. Of course, that's one side of my brain, the other side of my brain says, things happen for a reason, and at the right time I probably wouldn't have been a good a father as I am today had I had a child earlier. There's always the option to adopt and plenty of things you could do but, so, I'll just be happy with what I have.
Story_ID: 613051
Speaker 1: Likewise when you look back at everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Other than family, you mean professionally, or just in general?
Speaker 1: In general, yeah.
Speaker 2: (Pause) That's an interesting question. I would say the work legacy is, you know you can say I've accomplished a few things along the way. The important legacy I think for me at work is that people will probably say that he always worked hard, always cared. Most would say, and he cared about me. He was a good guy, had to make some tough decisions, but was a good guy and good person to work for. And probably my proudest achievements at work are, when somebody who I've worked with gets promoted (laughter). Now you can, it is wonderful when you get it for yourself, but when somebody that you care about gets it, it's almost like having a kid. So, again, being trite, that phrase, leaving the woodpile a little higher than where you found it. It's probably, probably part of my legacy is that people would say that he's a good man, tried hard, helped me along the way, was honest, those kinds of things.
Story_ID: 613052
Speaker 1: Now, did your parents [Johanna Kresse Jack and Huston Jack, Jr.] get a chance to see you, have they got a chance to see you become successful in (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Do they, is this un- I mean--
Speaker 2: Unexpected (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Could they have predicted, "Oh yeah, we know you be, we knew you'd be good at sales or in management," or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they been around long enough to know. They certainly tell me enough how proud they are of me. So they, I probably would be surprised if they said that they thought my brother [Clifford Jack] or I would not be successful because we were--always been kind of high achievers. I think my father has said probably most often that he's proud of me as a father, and also my brother, because we are fathers unlike he was. You know my father was in the [U.S.] military, do as I say, not as I do, and not involved. We were--I was born in '51 [1951]. I blame it all on Oprah [Oprah Winfrey]. You know, we never realized how sensitive we needed to be, right, or could be until this Oprah generation, so it's not uncommon now for a father to change the diapers and take the kid to work, you know. Part of everyday for me is I race home so I can ask my daughter the question, "So, give me your high, give me your low today" (laughter). And get that one hug.
Story_ID: 613053
Speaker 1: Now is there anything I haven't asked that we need to discuss before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: The question is, is there anything in my life I want to share with you? Is that kind of what we're asking? Professionally, can't think of anything, if there is you know what, I'll videotape it and I'll send it to you, you can edit it and be your one post that you'd have to do to this. I'm sure there's something that I'll want to share, but no is the answer.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well the last question is similar to legacy, but a little different. Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I can't get particularly more creative than my answer already. I want to be remembered as a father, and I want to be remembered as a good man who did a good job and cared, and then helped a few people along the way. To me, getting another stripe is not that important. I heard conversations earlier about boats and that's not me. I live pretty modestly. I don't have a boat, never had a boat, don't have a vacation house, never, like to go on vacation, but, so accumulating things is not important to me. That phrase about a person with the most gadgets wins, that's not big to me. I also wanna be, and again I hate to spend all this time talking about kids and, I wanna be, I've said jokingly, one of the worst things you can do is to wake up one day and you're sitting across the table from your eighteen year old child and you look at them and you say to yourself, I don't like them (laughter). I don't like them. So I guess the other thing is it's important to me that the people that I have chosen to have in my life and they in turn chosen to have me in their life, whether they be friends or associates, think highly of me. I'm not that concerned about a lot of folks who I don't give a hoot what they think about me, but it is important to me that my friends and people who I respect, respect me. And it's not necessarily my boss or mayor or pope, it's the people that I think are most worthy of my respect and I have theirs.
Speaker 1: Okay. Thank you sir.
Speaker 2: Yeah, pleasure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
