Speaker 1: And I start out by asking five questions of everyone.  They're a little "People Magazine-ish", just short answers here.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'd like to know what your favorite food is?
Speaker 2: My favorite food.  Almost anything (laughter)..  I like food.  I guess lamb roast would have to be my favorite.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Spring, without question.
Speaker 1: Now, we're not having much of a Spring this year.
Speaker 2: Oh, it's the best time in the world.
Speaker 1: (Laughter)  Okay, favorite color?
Speaker 2: A primary one, certainly.  Maybe yellow.
Speaker 1: Favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Oh, all over the world.  There's no place that I've ever been that I wouldn't go back again, at least not very many places.  But given, given the past, certainly, the Middle East is among our favorite places to go.
Speaker 1: And favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: "So far, so good."
Story_ID: 60938
Speaker 1: That's nice.  Okay.  We're gonna get started, and I'd like to start out by asking you about your mother.  I'd like to have you state her name and tell us about what you know about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Okay, my mother's name was Dorothy Jennings.  She was born in Louisville, Kentucky, and her father worked for the government.  I'm not quite sure what he did, but it had something to do with the tax liquor and was sent to California.  And one of my favorite stories is my grandmother telling of going to California with three, young children, the youngest being my mother, who was maybe two years old, on the train for four days (laughter), with no disposable diapers (laughter) if you can imagine anything worse.  I can't (laughter).  But she went, they went to live in California until my grandfather died.  And then they went back to live with his mother in Louisville.  And that didn't work out too well.  She was very comfortably off, but also very clear about who was going to be boss in her house.  And my grandmother, interestingly enough, picked up, came to Chicago [Illinois] where she had an aunt and found a job with the Board of Education doing something around--she wasn't teaching.  She was taking care of the kids or doing something around the general support of children, got a job also in the evening sewing.  She was a beautiful seamstress, brought her mother up from Louisville [Kentucky] and she helped take care of the children.  And she raised these three children in Chicago [Illinois], by herself, with very little help from her mother-in-law.  And my aunt married soon after she finished high school.  My mother went to college, went to Normal College [Tuskegee Normal School for Teachers] and became a teacher.  She married.  She taught, I believe, for six months before she got pregnant (laughter).  My sister was born.  She taught another three or four months and got pregnant again with me, and so she never worked again.  But she was very active in civic affairs.  She was very much involved in the art center and Planned Parenthood.  She was always busy doing some kind of charitable, good works.
Speaker 1: Did she share any other stories about her--(simultaneous) [cough] (unclear)-
Speaker 2: She grew up down on 37th and Prairie.  They moved back to Chicago [Illinois]--they moved to Chicago when she was about ten, I guess.  So she had lots of stories growing up at 37th Street and Prairie and people that she knew, old Chicagoans who still were around, who would talk about what it was like to have lived then.  She went to Hyde Park High School [Chicago, Illinois].  That I know and seemed to have had, if not a very economically resourceful family life, a very full family.  People were very--neighbors, friends, everybody was pulling together, I guess, because they lived in a fairly nice house.  And my grandmother managed to keep this thing going with her mother as the support system at home.  And my mother seems to have had a very comfortable life.  She eventually made her debut and did all the things that middle-class black children did in those days and seriously, was involved in civic life.  My grandmother and my great grandmother were involved in Provident Hospital Women's Board [Chicago, Illinois] and all of the community ventures that were important then.  So she grew up with a commitment, I guess, to the community and to your neighbors, even though not a financial, not financially well off, but socially very committed to the improvement of people who were less fortunate.
Story_ID: 60939
Speaker 1: How--what would you describe your mother?  What was she like?  What kind of person was she like?
Speaker 2: You know, she was two different people.  When I was growing up, she was a very conventional young woman, typically middle-class black, community.  She did all the things that were expected and we certainly never went out of the house without our white gloves and our hats.  My father [Robert Taylor] died when she was about fifty, and she had never, had taken very much responsibility for financial affairs or any of that sort of thing.  Dad [Robert Taylor] did all of that.  And somehow or another, she made a shift.  The first, the first evidence of it was, I was living in Iran at the time.  And my mother and my father were planning to come and visit us.  And my father had some kind of a business deal going.  And he said he couldn't go and backed out at the last minute.  And my mother said, "I'm gonna go anyhow because my first--second grandchild is getting ready to be born, and I certainly have to go over there--my third grandchild," I guess it was.  And so she came to Iran all by herself, and that really surprised me.  I had no expectation she would take a trip by herself, half way around the world.  My father had his last illness while she was with us actually.  She went home, and six weeks later, he died [1957].  And from then on, she just took charge of her own life.  She was always a very social person, but she became even more social, and she loved young people.  She became a favorite, lots and lots of young people who invited her places and she traveled with a friend of hers and her sister.  She came over to see me two more times by herself, once going around the world by herself.  And she just became very competent.  She took over her own money and increased her (laughter) wealth considerably on her own efforts, buying stocks and bonds.  She always had enough money to do what she wanted to, but never discussed it with you.  Let me assure you, we were surprised when she died, how well off she had become through taking responsibility for herself.
Speaker 1: That's interesting, but she really had, but she probably had all those, the beginnings of that because of the-
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --heritage of your grandmother.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, and my father traveled a lot, so she was frequently home alone with the kids.  During the War [World War II], my father [Robert Taylor] was in Washington [D.C.] three weeks out of the month, and so he was only home a week.  And I remember once, we were in Washington [D.C.] for the summer, and he had something that he had to do.  He could only drive us a quarter of the way home.  And so he got on the train and went back to Washington [D.C.], and she drove the rest of the way home.  Well, that was unusual in that day and time for a woman to take little kids and drive home.  So she's always had the capacity to do.  It was just in those days, convention, fathers made the lead--were the lead persons in houses.  And wives were, their job was to follow up and take care of the kids.  And she did wonderfully well.  She was always there, and we could have as many kids sleep over as we wanted.  There were always gangs of kids in our house because mom was always very welcoming to other children.  She was very, she was a good mom, and then she became a wonderful person in her own right.  So I said, she had two separate lives.
Story_ID: 60940
Speaker 1: And your father, give his name and can you talk about his background?
Speaker 2: My father's Robert Taylor, Robert Rochon Taylor.  His father was Robert Robinson Taylor.  Dad was born in Tuskegee, Alabama in 1900--1899.  We're never quite sure.  And he was the second--no, he was the first of four children.  My, his mother was from St. Martinville, Louisiana.  They had, her sisters and she had all been to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], so they were college educated and very, very comfortably off family in St. Martinsville.  And she married my grandfather, and as I said, had these four children, my father being the eldest.  And, of course, in those days, there was no high school in Tuskegee [Alabama].  So the first escapade that I heard of my father's was when he was at Howard Academy [Howard University, Washington D.C.], and did a little hazing of some young man and got sent home (laughter).  And grandfather said to him, well, if you haven't got enough sense to do well in school, you can stay here and work.  My grandfather was an architect.  So he sent him to work in a saw mill.  And dad got interested in making--building houses that were using the saw mill as the center.  And he actually started constructing houses in the community.  And I guess grand-daddy decided by that time that he had learned his lesson, and he was sent off to the University of Illinois to complete his education.  And he got his Bachelor's degree at the University of Illinois and came here to work in Chicago [Illinois] and marry my mother.  And he started off [1928], I believe, at the Supreme Liberty Life [Insurance, Chicago], but in some insurance company and then began to manage the [1930] Rosenwald Building, Michigan Boulevard Garden Apartments [Chicago, Illinois] which is really where, anchored his career, which was the first large-scale housing project for middle-class African Americans.  And from there, got interested in building houses.  And he did some construction out in the South suburbs [Chicago, Illinois].  He also got interested in the fact that it was so difficult for African Americans to get mortgages, and so he and some of his friends began the first home loan bank for African Americans, the Illinois Savings [Illinois Service Federal Savings and Loan Association].  And it still exists here in the community today.  And during the War [World War II] years, he was asked to come to Washington [D.C.] to work as a "dollar-a-year" man in the government.  And he did that every--I told you, every three weeks out of the month, he was in Washington [D.C.], during the War.  And I guess in the early '40's [1940s] [1935] he went on the Chicago Housing Authority and became the chairman of the Housing Authority [1939], through the early, I think about 1950.  And in those days in Chicago [Illinois], there was a very strong segregation limit to where African Americans could live.  They were, restricted covenants were still in place.  In 1946 [1948], I believe the [U.S.] Supreme Court declared the restrictive covenants no longer legal [Shelley v. Kraemer].  And so the opportunity for African Americans to move in new neighborhoods existed.  And he tried very hard to create housing projects that were integrated.  And that was not a part of the city's plan at that point.  And so he finally resigned from housing authority about 1951, '50' [1950], somewhere along in there, '52' [1952], maybe [1950].  I don't, I think he was a little bitter that he had devoted so much of his life to trying to establish decent housing for people, and he was afraid that re-segregation was just going to perpetuate the limited opportunities for black people.  And so he became much more interested in other kinds of projects.  He worked, for instance, a feasibility study for the Lake Meadows complex [Lake Meadows Apartments, Chicago, Illinois].  He began building housing again, in the South suburbs and became much more interested in a variety of different ways to forward the causes of African Americans in Chicago [Illinois].  He thought that integration was the best answer.  And in a way, it was probably good that he died when he did because (laughter) that would have been a very unpopular perspective ten years later.  But he really did believe that the best bet for African Americans was to become integrated into the larger society.  And that meant education.  It meant financial resources, and that was how he spent his, the later years of his life.  He died when he was fifty-seven [1957].  So he didn't really live a long time from my perspective (laughter) anyhow.
Story_ID: 60941
Speaker 1: He was a very, in many ways, I guess he was kind of a rigid guy.  He was very clear about what he wanted you to do and how he wanted to do it, what he wanted mother and the kids to do.  He didn't interfere in child rearing in any way, but like the standards were very clearly set.  There was no question that you would do well in school and that you would go on and get advanced degrees.  And education was just really, really important to him.  He and I got along very well, so I don't--I mean I knew that he had high standards, and--for instance, if he went to a party and somebody told a dirty joke, he'd get up and leave.  He would never sit and listen to a dirty joke, particularly if my mother was there.  So things like that.  He was, I remember his coming in and taking records off of the record player because he thought they were inappropriate.  So in that way, he was a very strict father.  But he didn't interfere in child rearing, particularly with the girls.  He just, you know, whatever we did was okay, generally speaking.  Then when I was in college, he used to come to New York all the time.  And so whenever--I was in school in New York.  And so whenever he was in New York, we would have dinner together, or I'd stay downtown with him in a hotel.  I remember he took me to the World Series [1955], I think when Jackie Robinson was playing.  It was a very exciting time.  So we got to be friends as adults.  Then I remember, sort of my last coherent memories of my father were after I got married, the first summer I was married, the, we were living in the Rosenwald [Apartment] Building [Chicago, Illinois] on the fifth floor, right under the tar roof.  And I woke up one morning, and the temperature was one hundred-two in this apartment.  Of course, there wasn't any air conditioning in those days.  So I woke my new husband [James Bowman] up, and I said, "I'm going home to my mother.  If you'd like to, you can come with me (laughter), but I'm going home (laughter)."  They had air conditioning.  And, but nevertheless, my father and I would talk all night long.  We'd sit on the porch and rock and talk.  My husband kept saying, "What do you all do all night?" (Laughter) But it was very interesting that I think we got to be very good friends as adults, when I was an adult, in a way we hadn't been when I was a child.  When I was a child, he was father.  You just had to be a little bit careful.
Story_ID: 60942
Speaker 1: One thing, just to go back a generation, can you talk a little bit about your grandfather, you know, your father's father--you know-
Speaker 2: My father's father?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: My grandfather [Robert Robinson Taylor] was born in Tuskegee [Alabama]--in Wilmington, North Carolina.  And the story may be a little apocryphal, but it goes something like a Boston [Massachusetts], a lady from Boston recognized the talent of he and his brother and sent them to Boston to Boys Latin [Boys Latin Academy].  However he got there, we're not quite sure, but he did go to Boys Latin, he and his brother both went to Boys Latin [Academy, Massachusetts].  And then my grandfather went on to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology] and was the first African American to get a degree from MIT in architecture.  Needless to say, there weren't lots of opportunities for practice.  And so he and--by that time, had married my grandmother.  He was living in Cleveland [Ohio], married my grandmother.  And they went to North Africa and lived for two or three years.  And he did architecture there.  They finally came back to Cleveland [Ohio] where he knew Booker T. Washington who said he was getting ready to build this academy [Tuskegee Normal School for Teachers, 1881] down there in Tuskegee [Alabama], and wouldn't he come down and design it for him.  And when he got down there, he discovered, not only did he have to design it, he had to teach the boys how to make the bricks for it (laughter) because there were no--they didn't have the money to buy the bricks.  So he got very much involved in teaching these kids how to perform the manual skills necessary to build these buildings.  And after the buildings were built, he stayed on for about fifteen, twenty years as vice president [1925] and was very much interested in the educational component of the--then it was just a school [Tuskegee Normal School for Teachers].  It wasn't a university.  He retired in about 1938, something like that, '36' [1936] [1945] to, back to Wilmington [North Carolina].  And that was a point at which--I went down to Tuskegee [Alabama] maybe once or twice, but I knew him as an eight or nine year old.  Every summer, we would start going to Wilmington [North Carolina] to spend the summer with him and my step-grandmother in--they had a house on the beach.  And my father's sisters and brothers would all come with their children.  And we stayed in his beach house, piles of children and absolute--you know, you never saw your parents from one day's end to the next.  It was wonderful, running wild in the, down at the beach.  And I, my memory is my grandfather sitting on the hill watching his grandchildren off the pier.  We would crab and swim and do all kinds of things, had a wonderful time.  And granddaddy [Robert Robinson Taylor] used to come to Chicago [Illinois] maybe twice a year.  And he'd stay two or three days, a week maybe.  But he was, you know, it was adult kinds of things.  They had dinner parties and whatnot that we weren't included in.  So my memories of him are really most intimate from the beach.  And we would go up and he'd tell us stories and he was a completely hands-off grandfather.  He never interfered with anything that we did.  He might have told somebody else to do it (laughter), but he certainly never told us to do anything.  Good, good grandfather.
Speaker 1: Now, besides Tuskegee, what--were their other major developments?  You hear a lot about his, you know, your family and the building of Tuskegee [University, Alabama], which is one of our major institutions.  But were there other major developments after that, after Tuskegee?
Speaker 2: No, he retired from Tuskegee [University] [1935].  He spent most of his professional life in Tuskegee.  And I--he must have had businesses on the side because he was able to retire and not work for another twenty years.  So he must have had some way of earning money, and whether he--I don't know that he did very much work once he went back to Wilmington [North Carolina].  But he probably had some kind of business ventures.  He was certainly quite comfortably off.
Story_ID: 60943
Speaker 1: Now, Dr. Bowman, what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, I grew up in the Rosenwald Building [Rosenwald Apartments, Chicago, Illinois] (laughter).  We moved in, I guess, when I was about nine or ten months old.  So that's my entire childhood, was the Rosenwald [Apartments].  And as you know, it goes around a city block and the inside had playgrounds and flowerbeds and grass and benches.  And it was a community inside.  And everybody knew everybody else.  People were--I can still see it, of the summer evening, people sitting outside on the benches.  There was no air conditioning in those days so in the summertime, everybody came outside, and walking through the garden and everybody talking to one another.  It was a very, very close-knit community.  And so there were enough kids in the neighborhood or right in the building, so we never missed playmates or--and, you know, we still have, from time to time, have had get-together's for the Rosenwald Building people.  And we've had a wonderful time.  Almost anybody who was middle-class and black who lived in the Rosenwald [Apartments] or went to nursery school (laughter) in the Rosenwald.
Story_ID: 60944
Speaker 1: Did your father ever tell you the story about how the Rosenwald Building came to be?  I mean what was its genesis?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, Julius Rosenwald, evidently had been very much interested in African Americans, and had started some scholarships in the South for African Americans [Rosenwald Fund, Rosenwald Schools].  And I don't know that I ever knew quite how he and my father knew one another.  There is, you know, this program on the Rosenwald Building that was on Channel 11 [PBS, WTTW] last Spring ['From Sears to Eternity: The Julius Rosenwald Story', 2001].  Did you see that?  They had a program on the Rosenwald Building and what it meant to the people who lived there.  Unfortunately, I didn't see it either.  But--I've lost the question.
Speaker 1: No, you, I was asking did your-
Speaker 2: (Unclear) I don't-
Speaker 1: No, no, you're doing fine.  I was asking what you knew about its genesis, about the genesis of the -- (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --and how your father came to be involved?
Speaker 2: I knew that, I know that he knew Julius Rosenwald before he became the manager of the building and that--so somehow or another the connection must have been made through his work in real estate.  And he asked dad if he would come and take over this building.  And he did that the rest of his, his life, and became vice president of the corporation [Rosenwald Apartments] and was very much involved with, knew all the family members.  And this was a major effort on their part.  And I think dad [Robert Taylor] made it--if it didn't pay, (laughter) at least it didn't continue to run a deficit.  And so his business acumen, I think, was very much appreciated.  And the Rosenwald family kept the building until after dad died.  And then it was a major commitment, I think, and certainly didn't make the kind of interests that you might have gotten investing somewhere else.  But other than his, Julius Rosenwald's interests in the forwarding of education and housing in the African American community, no, I don't know any more about it than that.
Speaker 1: And you don't know how they met?
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 60945
Speaker 1: Your father--when you got to know your father--I don't know if we're gonna have time, but, I mean when you, later, when you said you became an adult-
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --and you would have these long conversations, what were some of the things that you learned about your father?
Speaker 2: How difficult it was.  I had had no idea, you know, he always seemed so competent and able.  I had no idea how hard it was for a black man to make it in the Chicago [Illinois] of 1920s.  I really began to have some appreciation of how difficult it must have been to have nothing or to have very little, and, of course, they had more than most.  But, nevertheless, he said, you know, it was just constant prejudice everywhere you looked.  It was always with you.  There was no way to get around it.  And even though we were living in the North, we were certainly very much aware of the South.  You know, some of my early memories are of listening to the news of lynchings in the South.  It was very much a part of the family, but it didn't have an--my daddy was gonna take care of us, and we didn't have to worry about that.  And so I really began to have an appreciation of how difficult it must have been for him to manage.  The second I think I got was his belief--really belief that you had to be a business person, that you just couldn't rely on the system to take care of you or anybody else.  And you really had to plan, you had to think carefully.  You had to have a certain entrepreneur quality if you were going to make it.  I had not realized, of course, and I thought he was, all he did was manage the building.  I didn't know the other things that he did and how he managed to keep us supplied in enough money to live comfortably.  It wasn't easy.  And so I really got a much closer appreciation, and a sense that it makes a difference that you take good care of what you have, that you don't waste your money, that you're reasonably frugal, that you think carefully about how you're spending as well as making sure that you have it invested in something that's gonna give you a nice return.  His interests in education.  We talked about books.  We talked about things that we had read.  I never knew he had read all the books that I read in college.  So we spent long times talking about Plato and Aristotle and things like that, and his concern about us and where we were going and how we would live our lives.
Story_ID: 60946
Speaker 1: Now, did you have a sense of your family and its role?  When did that sort of--did you ever, was that sort of inculcated in you -- (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was kind of with mother's milk, that you have a responsibility to the community, was absolutely unquestioned.  Mother [Dorothy Taylor] said it, daddy [Robert Taylor] said it, everybody said that we were lucky that we had more resources than most other people had and, therefore, we had a bigger obligation.  And that was without question, a part of daily life.  My mother also felt strongly about religion.  And dad was really, growing up, was not terribly involved.  After I went off to school, he got reinvested in the Catholic Church.  But as a child, he was not at all into religion.  But the social responsibility was very much a part of what he believed in.  So, no, it was never a time when I knew that you could sit back and relax and enjoy.  And I always had to get up and move and give back.
Story_ID: 60947
Speaker 1: Now, Dr. Bowman, the other question I have on your family, was there ever any instance of people passing [passing for white] at all, 'cause it seems like the family was squarely set within the African American community?
Speaker 2: Yes, my grandmother's, my mother's mother's--no, yes, my mother's mother's [paternal great-uncles] brothers.  As far as we know, she had two--my great grandmother's grandmother went to Oberlin [College, Minnesota], and was there when her father died, who was white.  And she was then brought back to Louisville [Kentucky].  She was free, and she married.  And her brothers and sisters mostly decided to be white.  She decided to be black, and she married a man who was as fair-skinned as she was.  But they decided to be black.  He died early, and so she lived most of her adult life with my grandmother.  My grandmother was very, very fair, but there's simply never any question that she would be a part of the African American community.  Her aunt lived, I think for a short time as white, and then she went back to being African American.  So there was no question that the opportunity was there.  As a matter of fact, I remember my great grandmother telling us about being on the, a train and going South and they wanted her to get out of the Jim Crowe car, and she wouldn't do it (laughter).  And they finally stopped the train and made a big fuss because she would not get out of the Jim Crowe car.  They could not conceive that she was black.  And certainly, you know, most of them would not be considered, would not look, did not look black.  But there was never any question that, you know, we were black.  It always surprises me still if people don't know I immediately because that's the way I see myself and everybody else in the family.  We range from white to brown, but I don't think anybody ever thinks about us as being anything but black.
Speaker 1: Was there, has there been any tracing of those who passed and how they did?  Do you know or-
Speaker 2: Well, it's back two generations now.
Speaker 1: Back, yes, I know.
Speaker 2: I remember visiting my uncle in Berkeley [California].  Maybe it wasn't in Berkeley.  We were in Los Angeles [California].  We went some place to visit him, and mother said that he was living as white.  But that was my grandmother's brother.  So even though he was living as white, he certainly knew who his black relatives were, and there was no problem about us visiting him.  But we didn't really have any contact with anyone, and I guess the generations lost track of one another.  Everybody we knew was black.
Story_ID: 60948
Speaker 1: Now, you're--you have one sister.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you give her name?
Speaker 2: [HM] Lauranita Dugas, D-U-G-A-S.
Speaker 1: Oh, my goodness.
Speaker 2: You didn't know [HM] Lauranita was my sister?
Speaker 1: I didn't know.  My God, it's like together (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  Somebody said to me once, "Is there anybody you all aren't related to?"
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That's what I'm saying.  Okay.  (Laughter) Is she older than you?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're the, you were-
Speaker 2: I'm the younger-
Speaker 1: --the youngest of--okay, the two.  Okay, now, can you just describe your--you've just done a lot of good description, but any other sort of favorite memories you have of growing up?  You said you were at 35th and-
Speaker 2: No, it was my mother was at 35th and Prairie.  We were at 47th and Michigan in the Rosenwald Building [Chicago, Illinois].  And my sister and I are only twenty-two months apart.  So we were pretty much in the same group as children and through our adolescence.  We had a very, I would say a very wonderful, early childhood.  The War [World War II] started, however, when I was twelve and she was fourteen, and certainly, during the War, it was a period that was pretty tense.  She went to college.  I went to prep school in 1944.  Chicago was, as usual, having its problem with the schools.  Tuskegee [Alabama] still didn't have a good high school for black kids, so my, the oldest cousin in the family was Helen, and she had gone to Northfield [Northfield Mount Hermon Prep School, Massachusetts] the year before.  And so my mother and father thought it would probably be a good idea for me to go too.  So the next year, I went to Northfield [Mount Hermon Prep School].  And I was fourteen at the time--fifteen.  And from then on, I was in the East, so I was only home in the vacation times until I came here to graduate school in the 1950s.  So my sister went to the University of Wisconsin [Madison].  I think, you know, she suffered terribly from a terrible education [Chicago Parker High School] which I was saved from by going to prep school and getting the two years up on it.  And I went to a very avant garde college [Sarah Lawrence College, New York] and she went to a very conventional college [University of Wisconsin-Madison].  She married in 1949.  I married in 1950.  She lived in Milwaukee [Wisconsin] until about 1952, '53' [1953].  She came back to Chicago [Illinois] two months before my husband and I went to Denver [Colorado] 'cause he was, had been drafted into the [U.S.] Army as a physician.  And then we went overseas from there and really didn't spend much time together until I came back from Iran and England.  And, of course, we lived, moved in a half a block away, and our kids, raised together.  There were, I don't know, (unclear) fifteen cousins within a three-block radius (laughter).  So we all took responsibility for each other's kids, and it was a wonderful way to raise kids.

Speaker 1: Now, I wanna take you back really to your early years again, and I would like you to tell me what sort of sights, smells and sounds, or sounds remind you, you know, reminded you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sometimes I think, you know, I wasn't a very aware child.  I was very much into myself.  I painted, and I really didn't--they say I didn't speak to anybody until I was full grown.  I don't know whether it's true or not.  But I really wasn't a very outgoing child.  So I don't have a lot of vivid memories.  If you say, you know, what do you, the sounds and smells, I remember I went to Mrs. Cockrell's Nursery School, a Michigan Boulevard, garden apartment nursery school [Rosenwald Apartments, Chicago, Illinois].  I have wonderful memories of that, the smell of macaroni and cheese still turns me on and playing with blocks.  And they used to give us cod liver oil every morning, and we had to drink a glass of water.  They combed your hair and brushed it after nap, I mean, you know, it was a wonderful experience.  I went to school way out South.  My father had gotten permission for us to go out of the neighborhood because the schools in, the schools were all terrible, but obviously, they were worse within the African American community.  So we went to school out at 62nd in Englewood [Chicago, Illinois], in that area.  So it was a long way from home.  My chief memory there is, I was in a, what was called a "fast-moving group", and I didn't, I didn't do anything the rest of the class did.  There were ten of us that sat over in the corner, and we educated ourselves as far as I can see.  And we just did our own, we had something that was, I guess a preliminary to some of these unit educational systems where kids go through at their own pace.  And that's what I did for, I don't know, two or three years.  And my other memory was that, at somewhere around seven, my mother had told my sister [HM Lauranita Dugas] that we only had one--or two other black kids in my class.  And my sister was two years ahead of me, but you had to hold hands to go into the school at the end of recess, first thing in the morning.  And there wasn't any black kid in my class to hold hands with, and none of the white kids would hold your hand, of course.  So my mother made my sister hold my hand (Laughter) Oh, she was furious with me.  Why can't you find somebody?  I--there aren't any others (laughter).  So she had to do that.  That was a lot of fun.  And what else do I remember?  We went to California.  She had a mastoiditis and eventually an operation and Faith thought she should get out of the weather in Chicago one winter.  So the winter when I was seven, I guess, we went to California and lived.  And my memory there was getting underneath the desk when you have an earthquake drill.  I thought that was so interesting that you had to go sit under your desk.  And they gave away oranges as you left school.  It was a period, of course, when--it was during the Depression.  And they had--the city would buy up all these oranges to try to keep the orange growers, I guess, in business.  And they handed them out free.  So, you know, every time you left school, from noon and in the afternoon, they gave you an orange.  And we had this huge bowl of oranges, that my (laughter) sister and I would bring home from school.  And then we came back to Chicago, and I continued to go to Lewis Chaplin School [Chicago, Illinois].  The War [World War II] started just after I finished or just before I finished grade school.  And so during the first two years that I was at, in high school, it was during the War years.  And my cousin and all the rest of the young men were going to junior college, waiting to be drafted.  And so it was period of some nervousness.  And then my mother's sister's son was drafted, and then they all began to leave soon after that.
Speaker 1: Now, how long were you in California?  You were there for-
Speaker 2: About a year--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: A year.
Speaker 2: --maybe six months.
Speaker 1: Did your father--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Just your mother?
Speaker 2: My mother took me and my sister out in, I don't know, maybe the fall and came back in the spring.
Speaker 1: You have relatives there.  No?
Speaker 2: No, not any more.  Kathryn Dickerson, I don't know--Earl [B.] Dickerson's wife, she and her daughter went out the same time.  And she was from California, her family were there.  And so we spent a lot of time with her family who lived a couple of blocks away from us.  And, but, Aunt Kathryn, Diane and my mother and my sister and I all went to California that winter.
Story_ID: 60950
Speaker 1: Now, what kind of child do you think you were?  You were shy, right?
Speaker 2: Very shy.
Speaker 1: Very shy.
Speaker 2: Very--you know, I don't know that I was shy.  It was just that I was primarily interested in what was going on in my own mind and not an outgoing kind of person.
Speaker 1: Can we talk about what was going on in your own mind?
Speaker 2: Very much interested in painting.  I went to the Art Institute [Chicago, Illinois] from the time I was maybe six or seven.  And, you know, my memories, every Saturday morning, I got on the bus by myself and went down to the Art Institute and took my classes, and then I got on the bus and went home.  And one day, I lost my bus money.  And I walked all the way from the Art Institute home, which was from, what?  Adams [St.] to 46th Street (laughter), and my mother was frantic by the time I got there.  And I just was very much interested in how things looked, and in visual representation.  I was good in school.  It wasn't particularly difficult for me.  I didn't have to think about it very hard.  So it wasn't very interesting to me.  Certainly, I was not a wonderful student, but obviously, I was good enough to be put off in the corner and (laughter) the teachers didn't bother to teach us anymore.  I had a couple of--eventually, as a matter of fact, I remember, there was a Greek girl who went to my school.  And she and I became friends.  And there was another African American girl came into the school--my class, and she and I became friends.  So I had friends.  It was just that I didn't have a lot of them.  And, in a way, we had two separate lives too.  We had our school lives and then we had our home lives.  And our home lives and I school lives did not overlap in any, at all.  We simply never saw anybody from school at home, and you never saw anybody from home at school until I got to be in high school.  So my mother drove us to school every morning and picked us up every afternoon until my sister was maybe thirteen.  And then we started--I started going on the streetcar.  My mother and father used to go to Cuba and other places in the Caribbean, I guess, in the wintertime.  And we had a woman, Mrs. Landers, who used to come and stay with us.  And that was always great fun.  She was, never interfered in anything you did.  You could do anything you wanted to do when she was there (laughter), so that was kind of nice.  My grandmother and my aunt lived first at 46th and Champlain, and I remember going over there one day and--with a friend, and sliding down the coal shut.  And, of course, obviously, what we must have looked like, they finally caught up with us.  And then my aunt and my grandmother moved out to West Chesterfield, which was the first sort of new African American neighborhood out at 93rd and Michigan [Chicago, Illinois].  And that was a very exciting venture where people were going and starting a new community.  And you had to hop over a white community in order to get there.  So, going to West Chesterfield was one of the things you did on a summer evening.  And there were lots of people Jim--do you know who Jimmy Jones is?  His grandfather, I remember they lived out there, and the Blanchards.  There were a lot of people who moved to West Chesterfield.  So there were now two--three African American communities, the Rosenwald [Apartments], Englewood or, it was mostly Englewood at that point and West Chesterfield [Chicago].
Speaker 1: West Chesterfield is where?
Speaker 2: It's 93rd and Michigan [Avenue], between State [Street] and maybe South Park [King Drive] between 92nd and 95th.  South of 95th was no man's land (laughter).  It was all white.  And then between say, 63rd and 92nd, it was mostly white.
Story_ID: 60951
Speaker 1: Now, let me just have the schools again.  You went to Mrs. [Oneida] Cockrell's-
Speaker 2: Nursery school.
Speaker 1: --nursery school.
Speaker 2: Then I went to Lewis Chaplin Grammar School which was at 62nd and about Normal [Chicago, Illinois], and then I went to Parker High School [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Before you went to Northfield [Mount Hermon Prep School, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Before I went to Northfield--not Francis [W.] Parker [High School], [Chicago] Parker [High School] here [South Side, Chicago].
Speaker 1: Okay, and then you went to Northfield?
Speaker 2: And then I went to Northfield [Mount Hermon Prep School].
Speaker 1: Cockrell is C-O-
Speaker 2: --C-K-R-E-L-L.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There's a, you know, there's a public school now named after Mrs. Cockrell.  She was a very important influence and--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: Can you talk about her?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was wonderful.  Actually, I think, to a large extent, she was the reason why I got an early childhood education.  I did have wonderful memories of Mrs. Cockrell's Nursery School, and, of course, it was a part of my life.  And we always saw the children in the nursery school going around.  During the morning, they would go out and play in the, in the yard.  So I never knew a time that I didn't know about the nursery school.  But I didn't have much contact with it, except when the younger siblings of my friends might have gone there.  And then I was getting ready to get married when I was in college, and I had taken child study, and I was so interested in these little kids.  But not, certainly wasn't gonna devote my life to them.  And I was trying to think of well, you know, how can I get a job because Jim [Bowman] was finishing his residency, and we didn't, we weren't gonna have a lot of money.  I needed to have a job.  And so I thought, well, I'll take the course and get a teaching certificate.  So, quickly doubled up in my senior year and took education and got my New York State teaching certificate and came to Chicago [Illinois] to get a job, and went down to the Board of Education and said, you know, "I'd really like to get a job teaching kindergarten."  And they suggested that I go visit a kindergarten.  So I went to visit--I don't even remember where it was.  But the woman told me she had fifty children in the morning and fifty children in the afternoon.  And the, she had a piano in her classroom, and she had a mirror mounted on the piano so that she could watch the children while she was playing the piano.  Well, I knew I have to watch my fingers when I play the piano (laughter).  I was never going to make that.  So I went back to school.  I was feeling very discouraged.  And my advisor said, well, why don't you go to graduate school?  I said, we don't have any money.  She said, you can get a job teaching in a nursery school.  I know that they have one there [University of Chicago], and they just--they have graduate students who work there.  So I was, called Mrs. [Oneida] Cockrell.  And I said to her, do you think that's a good idea?  And she said, "Absolutely".  This was, they had just invited her to come and teach in the summer session.  It was the first time they'd had a black teacher.  And she thought it was a wonderful idea, and she would call and tell them that she thought I should be the person they hired, and, indeed, they did hire me.  And I didn't know a lot about teaching nursery school.  So I went to call on Mrs. Cockrell again during the summer, and she said, "Well, we start after they start.  Why don't you come and work for me for a couple of weeks, and you can learn a little bit about how to be a nursery school teacher."  So, indeed, that was what I did.  And I got my, cut my eyeteeth at Mrs. Cockrell's Nursery School.  And she came and she helped me establish order and all the things that I didn't know a thing about how to do.  And so when I went to the University of Chicago, at least I didn't feel quite as, well, skill-less as I had thought I would be, and had a wonderful experience there and eventually became a head teacher, and discovered I loved working with young children.
Story_ID: 60952
Speaker 1: Now, why do you think she was such a special person?
Speaker 2: I think she was very smart.  I think she was also very outgoing at a time when it wasn't easy.  She became a member of the nursery school organization here.  It was called NANE [National Association for Nursery Education].  She was the only black person who was a member of that organization in Chicago [Illinois].  She had contact with the people out in Ravinia [Highland Park, Illinois], a nursery school.  My mother was chairman of the board (laughter), so she had lots of support from the families of the children who went there.  And there weren't any other options.  If you wanted to go to nursery school, you wanted your child to go to nursery school, that's where you had to go.  Interestingly enough, it lasted from nine in the morning or eight in the morning till three in the afternoon.  People often ask me, was it unusual in those days, 'cause they would have had either a half day or you went to daycare, which lasted until five.  Why did it (unclear), such a strange thing.  So many of the women in the African American community were school teachers.  And so they could drop their children there in the morning and pick them up there in the afternoon, and I guess, you had to pick 'em up by three-thirty.  But the teachers who were--and, you know, in those days, you had several choices as a career you could be in, a teacher or a social worker (laughter).  We--nursing wasn't even on--I don't know, didn't know anybody who was a nurse.  So, there weren't a lot of choices for African American women, and that's, I'm sure, why Mrs. [Oneida] Cockrell kept her--the hours that she did.  And certainly, certainly, my mother was a teacher, and I think many of her friends were teachers.  Most of them, however, did not work after they had children.  Some of 'em did.
Story_ID: 60953
Speaker 1: Now, excuse me for going back, but your mother must have recognized your artistic interests and put-
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --in the art--(unclear) (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: And she was really artistic herself.  Actually, after my father died, she went back to the Art Institute and she took classes for maybe three or four more years and painted--we have wonderful paintings that she did.  During my childhood, she made marionettes, and she made us a doll house, which we weren't interested in, but all our friends used to call and say, can we come and play with your dollhouse because it had furniture in it, and, it was a beautiful, beautiful doll.  So she was very talented.  She quilted until she died.  She'd knit.  Every child that got born got an afghan and when they away to college, she sent every one of the cousins off with an afghan.  She was very talents artistically.  So, yes, she early on recognized that that was a skill that I had, and she was very encouraging.  She made sure that I had all the opportunities, all the materials that I wanted.  Occasionally, she would, you know, come in and say, you know, you need to go outside and play.  You just shouldn't stay and paint all day.  But mostly, she didn't interfere.  She'd encourage me to be interested in art.
Speaker 1: Did you continue, did you continue to paint-
Speaker 2: I did until I went to college, and in my first year in college, it struck me that I was not as good as I needed to be.  And was I going to continue and the answer was, no (laughter).  And I thrashed around with what to do with my life.  I tried city planning, and I tried the labor movement.  I worked in the ILGWU, [International Ladies Garment Workers' Union].  I did social work and really, it wasn't until I was getting ready to get married that I hit on education and decided to quickly prepare myself to teach.
Story_ID: 60954
Speaker 1: Now, were there any other people besides your family and sort of extended family in this neighborhood that influenced you?  Were there any other teachers besides Ms.--you know, that influenced or other people in the community that you looked up to or whatever?
Speaker 2: Well, as I said, my mother's best friend was Kathryn Dickerson.  So our lives were always intertwined with the Dickerson's.  I remember addressing envelopes for one of Uncle Earl [B. Dickerson]'s forays in to politics when he was running for alderman.  He was always into something, and we were very often involved in some way in his campaigns; certainly spent a lot of time with my grandmother and my mother's sister.  We were very much involved with them.  My mother's sister was a very interesting woman.  Her, she finished high school and then got married.  And her husband was a dentist here.  And she lived a very conventional life until just after the War--in a way, it's a parallel to my mother's life except that her husband was still alive.  She decided she wanted to start a magazine.  And in about 1945, '46' [1946], she started a magazine.  And it ran for maybe, she ran it for maybe eight, ten years.  Eventually, of course, it died (laughter), but it was about the same time [HM] John [H.] Johnson [Ebony Magazine].  My sister [HM Lauranita Dugas] was the cover girl on the original Negro Digest (laughter), and my father did not approve of that, I mean (laughter).  But she was, (unclear) asked mother and mother was a dear, thought it was fine.  So she was on the first issue.  Mother [Dorothy Taylor] was very much involved in the Art Center.  We have a wonderful picture that [HM] Gordon Parks took of us when, one Christmas, mother and my sister and myself.  And she stayed involved in the Art Center really until she was quite old.  So all of those things--and it was a very small community.  When [HM] Marion Anderson came to town, everybody went to hear (laughter) her sing.  When Paul Robeson came to town, everybody went to hear him.  There weren't a lot of things that you did.  You went to the black baseball games in the summertime.  The, it wasn't a terribly rich cultural life.  On the other hand, every Sunday, some church or another had a tea at the Parkway Ballroom which was at 45th and King Drive.  And they served something called Frappe, I don't know where--I haven't had it since then, which was in a, some kind of ice with ginger ale poured over it and tea and cookies and what not and different groups of women would get together, and they would prepare these things.  And you left a little silver offering at each table that you visited, and that's where you met the boys and their friends.  And so Sunday afternoon was tea time.  It was very common, certainly before the War [World War II] to do that, and again, after the War.  My mother and father had a very busy social life.  I can remember watching my father pop his to hat.  That was very exciting.  So it was very social, but it was all confined to a large extent within the community and certainly within the African American community.
Speaker 1: Do we need to change tapes?
Story_ID: 60955
Speaker 1: But on the other hand, Tuskegee [Alabama] was very much a part of our lives because people kept coming up, and the shoemaker and all the people who were in the neighborhood who we supported were largely from Tuskegee.  If something happened to the furnace in the building, my father called up people from Tuskegee.  So everybody who came to Chicago [Illinois] called Mr. Robby [Robert Rochon Taylor] because his father was Mr. Taylor [Robert Robinson Taylor].  So he couldn't be Mr. Taylor (laughter).  He was Mr. Robby, and they would call him, and he would try to help them get settled in the black community, and I said, I never had my shoes fixed by anybody who wasn't from Tuskegee [Alabama], all my childhood.  So Tuskegee was very much a part of our lives.  Most people from Tuskegee would come and stay with us.  Mrs. Bethune [Mary McLeod Bethune] used to come and stay with us.  So, it was, it was a very narrow community that I knew these were all exceptional people.  I mean certainly was very much aware of that.  But I also knew that they were very, very strong limits on what we could and couldn't do and expected to be discriminated against, expected the kids not to hold my hand going into school.  It was not--I can get more upset about it now, as an adult than I ever did as a child.  It didn't bother me a bit as a kid.  I mean, just tell my mother to make my sister hold my hand.  No big deal (laughter).  So, although we were constrained, I don't know that it discomforted us.  One of the interesting stories told recently is, when Laura [Jarrett], my granddaughter, was about ten, they were driving down Michigan Avenue and showed her Pres[bysterian] St. Luke's Hospital [Chicago, Illinois], what was then St. Luke's Hospital and told her that her grandfather [HM James Bowman] had done his residency there, but that he couldn't live there because they wouldn't let African Americans live in the interns' quarters.  And he had to live on the South side and come down at six o'clock every morning on the bus, and that his colleagues at the hospital would take turns taking him to lunch as their guest because he couldn't eat in the interns' quarters unless one of them took him as a guest, and how both wonderful that wasn't them, but also how constraining it was.  She said, "Why did he do it?"  And such an interesting question.  It never occurred to us that it was anything but the most wonderful opportunity anybody ever had.  And her question, "Well, why would he put up with that kind of foolishness?"  It was so, it doesn't--it did sort of bring forth the fact the world has changed a bit and that her, just unconscious expectation that you wouldn't have to put up with that, really came to us as a kind of surprise to--it was a wonderful opportunity.  He was the first black man to ever get an opportunity to be trained at St. Luke's.  We didn't mind the fact he couldn't go in the front door, and he had to get a room in the community.  And my mother found him a room with a friend, and he went down there every morning and went home every night, never thought a thing about it.  Well, we did think about it, but it was an expected constriction of our lives, and therefore, we weren't terribly angry about it.  We were just delighted to have the opportunity.  So the world has changed, and I can get more upset now about not having somebody's hand to hold than I did when I was ten years old or eight years old, however old I was.
Story_ID: 60956
Speaker 1: Now, when--you said you went to Northfield [Mount Hermon Prep School, Massachusetts], it was in 19--was it forty--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-four [1944].
Speaker 1: Nineteen forty-four [1944].  Isn't that the same year--wasn't it around the '40's [1940s] [1939] that your father was head [chairman] of the CHA [Chicago Housing Authority]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay, do you remember him becoming head, and what a big deal that was?  Do you remember that being--'cause that was a big deal, wasn't it?
Speaker 2: It was a big deal, but he was, it was not unexpect--I mean that's what, big deals were what daddy [Robert Rochon Taylor] did (laughter).  He started a bank [Liberty Life Insurance Company] and he got a lot of discussion from that.  He sat on boards of directors of organizations.  It wasn't to us a big deal.  It was, the worse part of it from our perspective was every Sunday morning, he would put you in the car, drag you around to all the slum dwellings in Chicago and (laughter), really, I have very vivid memories of just how awful those were, the smells, and people stacked up together and the Depression, and he would haul us in and out of buildings that were getting ready to be demolished to show us.  And then he would--his favorite activity was to go down to the Ida B. Wells [Homes, Chicago, Illinois].  It was just a low rise, on a Sunday morning, and walk through there and talk to the, the people who were living there and point out to somebody that they needed to get their grass cut.  In those days, they were responsible for keeping the outside of their homes.  And he would just, "See how well they do.  All they need is a chance."  So he was really very involved in the day-to-day, sort of change in life for people.  And that we were very much involved in.  But that this was particularly an honor or something, I didn't, I certainly didn't have that sensation.  We knew--one of the interesting things is the number of people who I now know their kids and what not, primarily because their parents used to call--their fathers used to call my father on the phone.  And so the name stuck, and I'd (unclear), oh, I bet my father knew your father (laughter) because he knew most of the people in the housing business.  But they were not people that we were friends with every day.  They were names on the telephone to me.  He did have, you know, some of the people that we did know socially were white, the Reese's up in Ravinia, and I certainly knew the [Julius] Rosenwald kids when they were little, Alfred [Whital] Stern's kids.  But there wasn't a lot of socializing outside of the community.
Speaker 1: And when you had your discussions with him, was there any discussion about his role with public housing and-
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh, well (laughter), really--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: A lot?
Speaker 2: --how--and he'd just said, "Dag Barnum" (ph.).  I don't know where "dag Barnum" came from, but "Dag Barnum, they just don't want to give people anything."  And he would, he would rail and rant about how narrow-minded it was to try to keep African Americans confined within this community.  They were, this was the point at which they were buying the land on State Street in order to build the wall between Wentworth and the African American community, 'cause they still had hopes of holding the line there.  And he was so angry about it.  It was kind of (laughter) ironic that it ended up getting named after him.  But he was long dead by then, and I'm sure he didn't care.  But, no, he felt very strongly that the people who should have supported him didn't and that many people in the African American community should have been more supportive and weren't; that many of the people in the white community who hadn't been encouraging.  He felt (unclear) thinks that Elizabeth Wood [Executive Director of Chicago Housing Authority 1937-1954] was both his best asset and his worst (laughter)--they fought almost constantly about strategy.  And although he just loved her dearly, he felt that sometimes she, her abrasiveness got in the way of the compromises that they needed to forge.  But mostly, he just felt like he'd given everything he knew how to do, and they just weren't gonna--they were gonna segregate housing in Chicago.  And there was nothing he could do about it and that he didn't wanna be there when it happened.  And he had no political influence, and he couldn't seem to get any out of the African American community, and new opportunities were opening up.  And I think he just thought, well, can't do anymore here.  Let's move on.
Speaker 1: And what did he get involved with at that time, then after' cause--(unclear) (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: I know one of the, yes, one of the things he did was to help with feasibility study for Lake Meadows [Apartments, Chicago].
Speaker 1: That's right, but see--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Because people were breaking up--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: --he would have been excited about that then.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, he thought that was the way to go, and new opportunities were opening up in the private sector.  And they weren't in the public sector, and he just felt like, well, okay, let's shift gears and move more into the private sector.
Story_ID: 60957
Speaker 1: Now, when you went to Northfield [Mount Hermon Prep School, Massachusetts], how was that whole experience, 'cause this is your first time, you've had this very cloistered-
Speaker 2: Yes, it was very interesting for a little black kid from the Midwest (laughter).  But my cousin was there, and she was my roommate-- (simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: Which one, who's this?
Speaker 2: Helen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is the one who now is dead.  She was my roommate, and she and my sister were dearest friends.  So she immediately just took over the role of senior citizen--senior sister (laughter).  And she had a bunch of little sisters, Ann and Clarice.  So she was perfectly content to make me her little sister.  And so I went right into the same kind of relationship with somebody ordering me around, and I was comfortable with it.  One of the, when we were kids, when my father was in Washington [D.C.], we used to go down and spend the summer in Highland Beach in Maryland.  And one of the girls who used to be there with us was a Milton from Atlanta, Georgia.  And she was, Betty, was at Northfield at the time.  So there were maybe four or five black girls out of the five hundred at Northfield [Mount Hermon Prep School, Massachusetts].  And three of us lived together, Helen, Betty and me.  So I didn't feel like there was no one there to support me.  But I had been going to school with white kids all this time, so--and by this time, my Greek friend and I were friends at school.  So I was not uncomfortable about being in an integrated setting.  And the other thing, you were expected to get along.  That's one of the interesting differences, I think, between the '60's [1960s] and the '40's [1940s].  Life was supposed to be hard.  You weren't supposed to be happy (laughter).  That was not the "be all and end all" life that you were happy.  You were to learn something in school and be, get into a better college.  And if you were not happy, I mean my parents wouldn't have liked it if I had been bitterly unhappy.  But they knew I didn't like it, but they sent me happily back the second year.  No, I didn't like it at all.  I am couldn't--I remember sitting at the table the first day, and somebody said something about tomatoes [to-mah-toes], and I laughed uproariously (laughter).  Everybody turned to look at me (laughter).  And I said, well, don't you think it's funny?  She's saying to-mah-toes (laughter).  Everybody looked at me.  Well, what should she say?  I said, "Tomatoes" [to-may-toes].  And everybody looked at me like I was--I had no idea that anybody in seriousness called it a to-mah-toe (laughter).  So it was very different.  It was East Coast.  It was, it was a very different world for me.  And it was during the War [World War II].  I think I was a little afraid.  One of our family friends was killed, and that was always very distressing.  It was a tense time in the world.  And to be away from your family might have had something to do with it.  But as I said, I wasn't a very outgoing kid.  So it may just would have been that it was more, more was impinging on me than I was comfortable with.  But it was certainly a wonderful experience for me.  I had decided that--I had really wanted to go to Howard [University, Washington D.C.].  And my father said, absolutely not.  That's not one of the possible.  His experience at Howard [University] had been not too happy, as you'll remember.  He got kicked out of the academy.  But he really wanted me to stay upper East in school.  And, but I had been accepted at Oberlin [College, Minnesota] and Grinnell [College, Iowa], and Connecticut College for Women, which was where I wanted to go.  And he met the president of Sara Lawrence [College, New York] at a cocktail party.  And he got to talking to him, and they were then looking for African American girls, and so my father called me up and told me to apply.  And as they said, in those days, you did what your father told you to do.  I applied.  They accepted me.  That's where I went.  A wonderful experience for me, just wonderful and a progressive school after a really not very good Chicago [Illinois] education, and then a very rigid, very conventional prep school education.  It was wonderful.  And that was where I really began to be interested in intellectual activity.  I became a student, not because I had to, but because I wanted to be.  It was just a wonderful experience.
Story_ID: 60958
Speaker 1: Now, in those days, where there were, what?  How many black students in each class?  About two?
Speaker 2: At Sarah Lawrence [College, New York]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, one, two?
Speaker 2: There were two in my class.
Speaker 1: Okay, two.  What was it, I mean both--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: There was only one ahead of me though (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, right.  What was it like, those--I mean I know you were used to being just a few, but was it different than it is, you know, sort of now?  Were there--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Yes, we didn't certainly hang together.  I mean I knew the other black gal at Sarah Lawrence [College], but we didn't--she wasn't my best friend or anything like that.  My roommate was my best friend.  By that time, the world had loosened up considerably, beginning in my second year in college, I used to go out and stay with my roommate in Minneapolis [Minnesota], and go to parties with her friends, and she would come to Chicago [Illinois].  And the world changed a lot after the War [World War II].
Speaker 1: Did you find that people, you know, were--that you were, I mean the white were more of the liberal whites at that point?
Speaker 2: At Sarah Lawrence [College], certainly.
Speaker 1: At Sarah Lawrence [College], okay.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Sarah Lawrence [College] was known just more liberal to be--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I mean we had, was a very liberal school-
Speaker 1: Okay, and progressive.
Speaker 2: --and known for a school where the children of famous people went.  So they had less to lose by being friends with everybody.  And, no, I really felt very much at home and very comfortable there.  And the only untoward experience I remember is when, I guess, we were about sophomores.  Everybody was saying, you know, "We ought to go to Florida on Spring break."  And I was saying, "But I can't go."  And my friends were just appalled.  Why can't you go?  They really didn't know that blacks weren't allowed to stay in hotels.  And it sort of ended the conversation right there on that (laughter).  But by and large, my friends were pretty unsophisticated.  They were all from Minnesota.  They were (unclear), they weren't prejudiced.  They didn't have any, any attitudes at all about African Americans, and since I was the only one they knew, it was very comfortable.  My roommate and I went back to Sarah Lawrence [College] about, last year.  And we spent the weekend together in New York with other friends, and it was just wonderful.  No, it was a really--my husband [HM James Bowman] went to Howard [University, Washington D.C.], and it was a much more conventional experience.  And when we went to Iran, it was the first time, as he said, "We have not been, first of all, African Americans."  And I said, "You know, for me, it was the second time," (laugher) because in a way, that's the way Sarah Lawrence [College] was within the confines of the college.  On the other hand, Lead Belly [Huddie William Ledbetter] came up to give a concert and we took him down to the local tavern, and they didn't wanna serve us.  And I had some black friends who came down from Dartmouth [College, New Hampshire].  We went down to the local bar, and they said, no, you can't come in.  And then some of our friends came in, and then they decided that we could.  So, you know, there was still plenty of evidence of prejudice and discrimination.  I went into New York for another social life that was different from the college life.  But the college was really very comfortable and I had a wonderful time there.
Speaker 1: Was there any discussion in the black community then about, you know, going to, you know, historically black colleges [HBCUs], versus having an opportunity to go, be one of those to go to, you know, white, Northern schools?  Was there a-
Speaker 2: I don't know that there was any discussion about it.  I know that, you know, a majority of kids just did.  It was expected that you, Fisk [University, Tennessee] was, of course, the ideal.  But Howard [University, Washington D.C.], that's my--was my first choice.  Yeah, it was a social school.  And you meet lots of boys (laughter).  The--Talladega [College, Alabama] was certainly a school where a lot of my friends went, Spelman [College, Georgia].  You know, it was certainly one of the viable options, no question about it.  Why did I apply?  You know, my father wanted us to go to integrated schools.  He didn't want us to go to an African American school.  And my sister applied to the same kinds of schools that I applied to.
Speaker 1: Now, what did you major in and--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Everything you would care to name.  Sarah Lawrence [College] didn't require you to be a major.  So I leaped around, once I decided I wasn't gonna be an artist.  I tried a little bit of almost everything (laughter).  I did city planning in Yonkers [New York], and as I said, I worked in the union.  I got my teaching certificate, and I worked in a social service agency.
Speaker 1: Now, you are--let's see this is 19--let's see, you graduated-
Speaker 2: In '50' [1950].
Speaker 1: Fifty [1950].  So you were aware of sort of the activities around things being involved in the labor movement, you know-
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --looking at that in the work--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Um-hum, right.  This was primarily a Puerto Rican union.
Speaker 1: Oh, it was?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I learned to speak "Street Puerto Rican" there (laughter), and I used it in Mexico once, and a friend of mine said, "I wish you wouldn't talk anymore", (laughter).  I didn't realize it was quite so street (laughter).  But anyhow, no, I had a wonderful time.  But it was primarily a Puerto Rican union.
Story_ID: 60959
Speaker 1: Now, how did you meet your husband?
Speaker 2: Oh, he was in Chicago for an Alpha [Alpha Kappa Psi] convention and met my--I had a mutual friend of my--of ours, who had some pictures.  And one of the pictures she had was this picture of [HM] Lauranita [Dugas] on Negro Digest.  And he said, "Gee, that's a cute girl.  I'd like to meet her."  So my friend, Shirley, set it up, and I don't know, many things happened.  They didn't, they didn't go out.  But he--I don't know, long story.  She ended up inviting him to dinner.  And I met him at dinner.  And I was still in prep school at the time, and--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: You were at Northfield [Mount Hermon Prep School, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He came back two years later, I guess, or a year and a half later, and called [HM] Lauranita [Dugas].  And Lauranita was in summer school.  And so my mother said, she says the fatal words, "Would you like to speak to Barbara?"  (Laughter) And he said, yes, because he didn't know anybody else in Chicago [Illinois].  And so, we went out and that was the end of that.
Speaker 1: So you were how old at that point?
Speaker 2: I was eighteen by now.
Speaker 1: Oh, you were eighteen, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I met him when I was sixteen-
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --or seventeen, seventeen.  I was now eighteen, and, yeah, just a, a year later.
Speaker 1: Now, was he an undergraduate at that point?
Speaker 2: No, no, he was finished medical school (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, he was finished.  Oh, my goodness.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) He finished medical school when he was twenty-one (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, he was a young one, okay.
Speaker 2: Right, twenty-two maybe.  No, he was very young.  And, but he didn't know anybody in Chicago.  [HM] Lauranita [Dugas] was one of the few people he knew.  So when she's--he knew he'd met me.  And I was, I was maybe seventeen at the time, so I was around, I wasn't a child.  And so I was eighteen, almost nineteen when he came back. And-
Speaker 1: Did your parents like him?
Speaker 2: My father loved him to begin with because he used to come and play chess with him, and then he found out he was interested in me.  He didn't like him so much after that (laughter).  My mother, however, was wonderful to him.  She fed him 'cause as I said, he was going back and forth between the hospital and this room that he had on South Park [King Drive, Chicago, Illinois].  And, so she would have him to dinner all the time.  And she said, she courted him for me.  We were engaged about the end of a year, I guess, and--or clearly planning to get married after the year.  But I was by then sophomore in college, so that was the end of that, thinking about getting married.  And so we went another year, and we got engaged, and went another year and got married.
Speaker 1: So you actually got married right around the time of your graduation?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Three weeks later, maybe two and a half weeks later.  Yes, I got married immediately, and started at the University of Chicago in the nursery school (laughter).
Speaker 1: So he had finished, had he finished his residency at that time?
Speaker 2: Yes, he finished his residency that June too.  And he got a job at Provident Hospital as a pathologist, and didn't make too much money but enough to support us and for me to use my money to go back to school.
Story_ID: 60960
Speaker 1: So let's talk about--you said that, you know, Mrs. [Oneida] Cockrell, she had been helpful to you-
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and so by the time you started, U of C [University of Chicago] that was, you know, that, that experience helped--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you.  So what was this whole experience at U of C [University of Chicago] like, and why--how did that sort of relate--and I'm asking because I'm wondering what that experience laid the groundwork for, even the Erikson Institute [Chicago, Illinois] and the things that (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Yeah, and it certainly did.  At that time, Maria Piers was the first dean of Erikson Institute was the psychological consultant to the nursery school.  She was teaching at, and working at the hospital.  And she was psychologist, an anal--psychoanalytic, trained psychologist.  And she was a consultant to the nursery school, and that was where I met her.  And the other assistant teacher, graduate student with me, was Lorraine Wallach, who was the third person who started the Erikson Institute.  So it was very influential in that sense that we all met at the University of Chicago.  It was probably the preeminent pre-school, nursery school, in the city at that point.  I don't even think there was one--well, you know, there may have been one at Francis [W.] Parker [High School, Chicago], but certainly not at Latin [School of Chicago] or most of the other schools.  Mrs. Cockrell, as I said, involved in an AME which was a professional organization for nursery school, daycare people, and encouraged me to go and join, became very much involved, became the president of the successor organization.  She was, you know, she kept encouraging me to stay at the U of C [University of Chicago], finish up my Master's degree, start on my PhD, that we needed people in this field.  And there were opportunities there and it was going to expand, despite the fact that the daycare centers were closing as fast as they could in the 1950s.  But she really had a feel for the times, and she really felt that early childhood education was gonna come into its own and encouraged me to get involved.  And certainly, there wasn't a lot of evidence at that time.  I liked it, which was why I stayed there, not because I thought there were endless opportunities.  Then when I went to Iran, I worked in the nursing school.  And I did a little consulting for the childcare centers in town, but I worked a little bit in the orphanages.  But I really didn't do nursery school work.  When I came back--I went to England, and I couldn't work there at all.  And when I came back to the United States, I was looking for a job, and people at Chicago Childcare called me and said they had this opening for somebody in the preschool and would I be interested.  And that seemed like a good--I could work part time and [HM] Valerie [Jarrett] was just starting to school and it would give me a little flexibility.  And so I worked there for three years, I guess.  And by then, I was ready to move on.  And the question as, should I move into Child Life [Council] or should I move down to Erikson [Institute]?  And I decided on Erikson.
Story_ID: 60961
Speaker 1: I wanna go back just to the time when you were first getting started in the '50's [1950s], just a little bit.  And I want you to talk about the role of early childhood education--you know, 'cause before, I mean there wasn't even a thought maybe that gives you the educator, right?  (simultaneous)I don't-
Speaker 2: Well, certainly, it wasn't large numbers of people didn't.  Early childhood education is not new.  I mean certainly during the 19th Century there were schools that included children as young as four.  It wasn't a bit unusual, even in New England during the 19th Century for what were called Dame Schools, where children four or five years old were taught little bible quotations and how to embroidery and the alphabet and things like that.  So the notion of children as young as four being involved in some kind of school-like setting was not absolutely new.  Childcare, again, their--institutional childcare as opposed to taking of other people's children in your home, began actually in the South during the Civil War, where women were working in munitions factories, and they're taking care of the children in groups.  So neither nursery school nor childcare were brand new to the 20th century.  But there certainly were very, very minimal numbers of children involved.  It was probably in the--the mid 1920s, during the period where a large number of middle-class women began to have both time and money, that nursery schools really took off and in primarily upper-middle class communities, where the influence of psychoanalytic movement was very strong.  And the notion that children should get away from their mothers (laughter) sometime during the day was also a thought, that they needed to be socialized with other children, that families were getting smaller, and there weren't as many kids.  So they needed the opportunity to play with other kids, and they also--and then parents needed education.  And the nursery school as perceived of as a place to educate parents as much as a place to educate children.  Parents were encouraged to come in and to observe, many of them with cooperative schools.  Parents would come and work under the egis of a trained teacher and learn how to take care of children better.  So the whole notion of child rearing was on the ascendency in the 1920s, and upper middle-class people were the primary beneficiaries of it, if you think it's beneficiary (laughter).  But they were the ones who could take advantage of it.  Childcare was still, you know, primarily done in settlement houses for low-income kids, for kids whose parents couldn't, or wouldn't, take care of 'em and very small at that, mostly settlement houses were doing childcare.  And then during the Depression, childcare came to the fore, primarily--and the early childhood, primarily because they had an excess of teachers who didn't have jobs.  And so they were hired by WPA [Works Progress Administration] to run preschools.  And those folded right into the Lanamack (ph.) nurseries that were for War [World War II] workers.  So between 1933 and 1945, the government was probably the biggest purveyor of early childhood programs, but still, middle-class nursery schools got stronger and stronger.  And at the end of the War [World War II], they really again took off because many of the women were having multiple kids, and by the time the second kid came, they wanted to find something to do with the first kid.  Nursery school was the answer.  And so we found the rapid expansion of nursery schools, particularly in suburban communities.  Almost church had a nursery school, and many independent nursery schools.  But daycare fell off completely in the 1950s because the government closed all the daycare centers that they were supporting.  And that didn't take off again until the 1960s, late 1960s, early 1970s where the middle-class woman went to work, and then daycare just took off.  So there's been sort of, the two movements have come closer and closer together, to now, we find that they really are indistinguishable.  The nursery school movement became the preschool movement.  Daycare, childcare, called child care analysis, they're now using the same knowledge base.  Many children are in programs that are both educational and care-giving.  Everybody sees these two--what kids need is being quite close together and not two separate kinds of programs.  So the-
Story_ID: 60962
Speaker 1: You know, I wanna ask you about, you know, how Iran, how it happened?  How did your husband, how did that whole thing happen?
Speaker 2: My husband was practicing at Provident Hospital [Chicago, Illinois] and got a letter in the mail one day saying, Dr. [HM James] Bowman, please, Lieutenant Bowman, please come back to the [U.S.] Army.  He said, what do you mean come back to the [U.S.] Army?  And the letter said that he was in the [U.S.] Army of the United States.  Well, he had been in the [U.S.] Army during medical school.  And he was discharged the day he graduated from medical school, from his perspective anyhow.  And he thought he was through.  And evidently, he got discharged into something called the Army of the Republic (laughter).  And he was still in the [U.S.] Army, and they could call him up any time they wanted to.  And the Korean War started, and they called him up.  And they said, either you come volunteer or we will draft you as a private.  Well, obviously, that was not a good choice.  So there was an [U.S.] Army unit stationed here in Chicago [Illinois] called the Medical Nutrition Laboratory.  And he knew some of the people that were there, and so he called them up and said, "Wouldn't you like to have a volunteer, volunteer (laughter)?"  And they said, "Sure, we'd love to have you come down here and work with us."  So he went down to the Medical Nutrition Laboratory in the daytime and did his [U.S.] Army job, and at night he went to the Provident Hospital and did his evening job.  And our assumption was that that was the way his [U.S.] Army career would be spent for two years.  And I guess it was about four months later, five months later, they said they were gonna move the Medical Nutrition Laboratory to Denver [Colorado], Jimmy [HM Dr. James Bowman] with it (laughter).  And so all of a sudden, this wonderful plan is--making lots of money because he was getting his [U.S.] Army pay plus he was a pathologist for Provident [Hospital], was coming to an end.  So I was finishing my Master's [Degree] and starting my PhD.  And he got sent to Denver [Colorado], and so I finished up the last of my coursework.  He went out in October, and I went out in December and taught at Colorado Women's College.  And he did his [U.S.] Army stint.  And we were having a ball being away from responsibility and one thing or another, and I don't know what made us think that we should go abroad and live.  We had already been to Europe about two years into our marriage and had a wonderful time traveling.  So maybe we should do this.  We didn't have any children.  Why don't we do this for a living?  So he wrote to the Public Health Service, and they offered him a couple of positions in the Public Health Service.  And he was at a meeting in Washington [D.C.] and met a guy and said what are you gonna do?  Well, he'd been offered these positions in the Public Health Service and he was thinking about them.  He said, well, you know, somebody just offered me a job in Iran from Harvard [University, Massachusetts].  Why don't you call this so-and-so and find out about it?  So he called so-and-so and they said, yes, they were looking for pathologists to be in a hospital in Shiraz, Iran and that the consultants for this hospital were all Harvard [University] people he knew.  And come to New York and meet us, and see whether you'd like to do this.  And so we went to New York, and they said, oh, this is, well, nice fit--Jim [HM James Bowman] finished his boards by that time.  So he had boards, two boards, and we said, okay.  And so, absolutely, sight unseen, we jumped on an airplane and went to a little town in Southern Iran.  We arrived in Tehran.  Nobody was at the airport to meet us.  And we didn't speak a word of Farsi, of course, and they, nobody there spoke a word of English.  And people kept trying to move my luggage, and I remember running around frantically (laughter) trying to hold on to my luggage.  I'm sure they were just trying to be helpful, but what do I know.  And finally, this man walks up to us and said in English, "You look lost.  What's your trouble?"  And we said, well, we were supposed to be met, and they didn't come.  He said, "I'll drive you into Tehran."  So he drove us to Tehran to the place, one address that we had, and the people there, of course, were expecting us.  And we found somebody to take us in.  When we arrived in Shiraz, it was Mullah on the plane and they had a sheep, and they sacrificed the sheep as we got off the plane (laughter).  And I thought, what are nice people from the Midwestern part of Chicago doing in a place like this?  We had a ball.  We loved it.  It was interesting.  It was exciting.  Jim's work was interesting.  I had lots and lots of opportunities to do things that were at adjacent to what I did.  And we stayed six years.
Story_ID: 60963
Speaker 1: Did you find that, the culture very different and you operating as a woman who had been-
Speaker 2: Yeah, a little bit, but not, it wasn't--it was loosening up actually at the time.  And, for instance, I got the first driver's license of a woman in Southern Iran with a little subterfuge (laughter).  They didn't put my picture on it until the very end (laughter), and by that time they had decided they'd let me have it.  Until then you always had to drive with an international license because they didn't give driver's license to women.  When I, when they wrote me to tell me how to dress, they said, wear long sleeves and high necks, but I didn't have to wear a chador.  And when I got there, all those long sleeve dresses, eventually were found in the waste basket (laughter), and people dressed with short sleeves and much--of course, the Americans dressed much more conventionally and we were wore clothes down low, and we had a swimming pool on our compound, and--no, it was not terribly restricting.  You were a foreign woman, and, therefore, you were excused from a lot of things.  If you behaved in an inappropriate way, everybody excused you because you were a foreigner.  I learned to speak Farsi and that was, made it much easier.  And I lectured in the medical school and in the nursing school.  And they taught me Farsi, and I taught them English because I was supposed to be lecturing in English.  And they didn't know English very well, so between the two of us, we improved each other's vocabularies.
Speaker 1: Did you know you had a facility for language?
Speaker 2: No, I don't, I don't know that I really do, although once I was in a taxicab in Tehran, and I was just talking to the driver. And he says, oh, you're from Shiraz.  I thought, my goodness, isn't that wonderful?  I've got a Shiraz accent (laughter).  But mostly, I have an American accent when I speak Farsi.
Story_ID: 60964
Speaker 1: Did you--how do you think that experience changed you?  You're--now, [HM] Valerie [Jarrett], she was how old?
Speaker 2: She was born there [1956].
Speaker 1: She was born there.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we didn't have any children when we went-
Speaker 1: Oh, so you went, okay, that's what you were saying.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, when we got there-
Speaker 1: Well, was your family concerned, like your mother?
Speaker 2: Oh, my father [Robert Taylor] sent me a ticket regularly, two, one for me and one for Valerie (laughter).  I used to get calls all the time saying, Pan American Airlines, you've got a ticket deposited here (laughter) for Barbara Bowman and child, [HM] Valerie [Jarrett] (laughter).  He did not think it was funny.  He didn't object, I mean he didn't complain out loud, but he thought that Jim [HM James Bowman] would have done better to establish himself professionally in the United States.  And certainly, his daughter should not be hauled off to the country next to Russia where she could be cut off, and his granddaughter, much less.  And on the other hand, he was planning to come visit us the first time mom came, and my Aunt Helen and Uncle Gene came and visited us.  So, I mean--although he, whenever international situations got in turmoil, he would get anxious.  As a general rule, he was quite comfortable.  He knew I was adventuresome and it was a little hard to keep tabs on me too close.  And, yeah, certainly, Jim [HM James Bowman] didn't make a whole lot of money doing this.  But it was what he wanted to do, and it's what I wanted to do.  So the family were very supportive, really.  My mother came and spent a total of a year there.  She came and spent two or three months every time.  And she loved it too.  It was a wonderful experience.  We loved Iran.  We liked the people.  We still a lot of them.  Unfortunately, they're expatriates now.  Jim went back five years ago and discovered that the hospital laboratories are still named after him, all this time later, and they were still--the plaque is still on the wall.  So it, it's, it was, it's an interesting country.
Story_ID: 60965
Speaker 1: Now, how was that a growing experience because remember you said that this was the first time that you were not--you know, black--(unclear) (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Well, for Jim [HM James Bowman], it was for Jim the first time when he was primarily an American and not primarily black.  And he found it enormously liberating (laughter).  It, you didn't have to think about it, and it wasn't even a part of your imagination.  It was just day-in and day-out.  It simply wasn't a part of your thinking.  And the first time I remember sort of being aware of the fact I still was, was when [HM] Valerie [Jarrett] was about two, she hauled off and kicked her nurse.  And I swatted her on her behind, and the nurse said, "Why did you do that?  She should--she has a right to do that."  And it was the first time I realized what slave mentality was about, that this woman's notion was this two-year old had a right to kick her.  I just was brought up sharply by that, and I said to Jimmy, "You know, I might not be able to raise Valerie here."  We seriously--not seriously, but from time to time, considered, well, maybe, you know, we're not going home at the next two-year period.  And we're not going home in the next two-year period.  How many two-year periods would we extend?  And we really hadn't thought, you know, we're definitely going home this time.  But that was when it struck me that we probably wouldn't stay beyond her preschool years.  That, that wasn't--I didn't want her to grow up in a feudal country, and it was still a feudal country.
Speaker 1: You were a good mate for him to have-
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --'cause not many people, I mean he could have had a whole different--(unclear) (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah (laughter), he knows he was lucky (laughter).  He knows he was lucky (laughter).
Speaker 1: So did you, what about the--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: So was I too, then.  Not many men would have been willing to pick up and go half way around the world 'cause their-
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --wife thought it would be fun to go.
Story_ID: 60966
Speaker 1: That's right.  So what about the culture did you like?
Speaker 2: There's an exuberance among, I think it's probably true among many Middle Easterners.  I found the same thing in Nigeria.  I loved Nigeria the same way.  There's an exuberance about the people.  It's a little more subdued in Iran than there is in the--but people, they laugh when the world is falling apart around them.  There's a real joie-de-vivre that it's part--you know, you can down in the bizarre and people are laughing and talking and having a good time and enjoying the world, the resiliency.  You see the same thing in many under developed countries.  I don't know South America that well, but I've spent a lot of time in Nigeria, and hey, hate the corruption.  You hate lots of things about it, but there's something about the culture, resiliency and care for little kids and old people that you just don't find in Western Europe and the United States.  Personal relationships are so much more important.  When I first came home, I--somebody said, "Well, you know, how does it seem different?"  I said, "You know, personal relationships are like ping-pong balls here."  You sort of bounce off of each other.  There, you nest with one another.  There's a real sense of personal intimacy with friends that you just don't get here.  And I think that's still true.  There're some friends that we have that are Iranian that we still feel just extraordinarily close to because it's a personal relationship.  It's not based on who you are or institutional relationships.  You have it with friends, I'm sure, all over.  Everybody has friends, but it's a culture of friendship, I guess, is what I'm saying rather than just personal friendships.  And I think that to a large extent that's true in Nigeria.  There's a--in Nigeria, there's the exuberance too.  I mean it's colorful.  It's full of the beans.  It's got something going on every minute.  I like that.
Speaker 1: It's amazing 'cause lots of people talk about not liking Nigeria at all.
Speaker 2: I know.  It smells bad, and people are corrupt, and, you know, all of the above, but there's also the other side of it, and I like the other side of it.
Speaker 1: Now, when were you in Nigeria?
Speaker 2: Well, Jim [HM James Bowman] was an external examiner for the University of Lagos [Nigeria] for, I don't know, a long time.  (simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: Now, when did that happen as opposed, in-
Speaker 2: Well, the first time I went to Nigeria was in about 1966.  And then I went back, I guess, two more times in the '60's [1960s] and early '70's [1970s].
Speaker 1: But in between, you came back?  You went from Iran--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Iran to England.
Speaker 1: To England?
Speaker 2: We also lived in England for a year.
Speaker 1: You were gone for a long time.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 60967
Speaker 1: See, between [Northfield Mount Hermon] prep school, [Sarah Lawrence] college, Denver [Colorado], and Iran and England, I was gone from the time I was about fifteen until I was thirty-five in all.  I, you know, kept checking back in with family.  I really hadn't lived here continuously.  I was in graduate school when I was here, when I first got married.  And so I really--there's a whole period in there in which my knowledge of Chicago [Illinois] is pretty episodic (laughter).  When we came back in 1963, it was the first time that I've lived here continuously since I was a child.  And then for about fifteen years, twenty year maybe, almost every summer, we went abroad some place.  Jim's [HM James Bowman] research took him to Nigeria, to Uganda, to Ethiopia.  He used to go to Mexico.  By that time, Valerie was a teenager.  So I didn't go to (unclear) with him.  But we went some place almost every summer.  And Val [HM Valerie Jarrett] made her first trip to Africa alone when she was seventeen and met us in Beirut [Lebanon], a little nervously (laughter).  I was nervous, she was nervous (laughter), but a friend had invited her to come and spend some time in Nigeria.  And so she went to Nigeria for five weeks, and then we were going to Iran, and so she--they put her on the plane and we picked her up in Beirut.  So she was a pretty sophisticated little kid.  She'd been all over the world.
Speaker 2: So really, when you came back in 1963, it was good maybe that you were settled in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois] or your family was settled in Hyde Park because--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: Well, it was a natural place for us to settle.
Speaker 2: To settle.
Speaker 1: Jim had been offered a job in Colorado.  And we probably would have taken except that he went down to Mexico to a conference and met a whole bunch of University of Chicago people who said, you know, wait a minute.  Don't jump--we'd like to see if we could offer you something.  And so they waited maybe another month or so, and they made him an offer, and he decided the family was here.  The interesting, a good university.  So--and they were doing research on the line that he had been doing in Iran.  So it was a better fit.  And so we just stayed on.
Speaker 2: And at this point, you've been a mother about how many years, when you come back?
Speaker 1: [HM] Valerie [Jarrett] was six.
Speaker 2: Six years old.  Okay, that's what--'57' [1957].
Speaker 1: Six, almost seven.
Speaker 2: Right, and, you come back, and you say--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: Six or five?
Speaker 2: You said she was born in 1957, so-
Speaker 1: And we came in '62' [1962].
Speaker 2: Sixty-two [1962], okay.
Speaker 1: The reason I'm saying that is, she had started school in England, and when we came back here, we put her in second grade, and she was only, it seems to me five or six years old.  And I had some question about it, but the teacher was someone that I had known a long time.  And it actually worked out quite well.  But then, when she was about in fourth or fifth grade, she was just too far ahead of herself.  And I kept her, switched her to [University of Chicago] Lab School and kept her an extra year.  She did, I think fourth grade over again.
Speaker 2: So you're glad you did that?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, like I said, and then she skipped seventh grade too.  [cough]  Valerie kept skipping, and (laughter) I kept holding her back (laughter).  So, she was, she took her post-graduate year.  So she was seventeen by the time she finished, and ready to go to college.
Story_ID: 60968
Speaker 1: Now, you said when you came back to Chicago [Illinois], it was a different world, that you had, you had sort--well, you had--you ended up really sort of smack dab in a lot of turmoil, I would say--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --I mean the whole Civil Rights Movement, the sit-in's and on, I mean it was very exciting, but it, also quite different than what we had known.  And the sort of militancy of African Americans was really a shock.  But, obviously, this was something that any thoughtful African American had to be involved in, and we certainly--I was a consultant for early head-start programs in Mississippi and Alabama and those were all voting rights programs.  I remember driving in the, out of Selma [Alabama] with a whole bunch of young people.  Some were black and some were white, and we, we'd pass these little jails, and they'd say, "remember we spent the night there three weeks ago" (laughter).  And I'm saying, hey, you know, I don't wanna go to jail here in Alabama (laughter).  You all need to be a little more careful (laughter), an old lady like me.  Yet, the kids were wonderful.  And I drove all over rural Georgia, and then I was a consultant for Lee County and Auburn University in Alabama, and drove all over Alabama.  And most of the early-childhood programs were done in churches, along with the voting rights.
Speaker 1: Now, I thought Head Start started-
Speaker 2: Sixty-six [1966].
Speaker 1: In '66' [1966], but wasn't it, it started in the North, right, or you're saying-
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  It started all over.
Speaker 1: It started all over.  Okay.
Speaker 2: But the community action programs with which it was connected when it first started, in the South, were all voting rights programs.  And so the community organizations that got head start money also were doing voter registration.  And so head start was often seen in the South as a front for voter registration.
Story_ID: 60969
Speaker 1: Now, why did you think that Head Start was a good program?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, of course, early childhood education and its importance was--and I had no question--two things actually.  I think Mrs. [Oneida] Cockrell had been terribly influential in my mother's child rearing.  Mother would always say that Mrs. Cockrell was a person who had taught her more about child rearing in the twentieth century than if she had listened to my mother--or her mother.  It would have been a very different kind of child rearing.  I remember my mother saying that Sweet Ella used to always say to her, "Why do you always talk to the children?  Just tell them what you want them to do."  But Mrs. Cockrell said, "You should give them reasons."  And so my mother went around giving us reasons for everything and engaging us in conversation and doing the kinds of things that make kids feel important in the world.  And so I always knew that Mrs. Cockrell had given good advice to parents, and part of their nursery school movement was parent education.  So I felt like to help more parents, particularly in rural Alabama and Mississippi and in rural Chicago [Illinois], understand the difference between how we were raising our kids and what it would take for them to get ahead in the twenty-first century or the twentieth century it was then.  I think, I thought we needed to both have the programs for the children, but even more importantly, we needed to help parents understand why they needed to raise their kids in a different way.  And I still think that the African American community has not come to grips with the fact that many of the cultural patterns that we have that were very functional during the period right after slavery aren't as functional as they used to be, and that we do need to have and support other ways.  I think some of the things that we developed during the Civil Rights period aren't very functional.  The whole notion that the school is your enemy is not a functional way of thinking about it.  And, certainly, it is very pervasive in many African American communities, particularly low-income communities where the notion that the school isn't gonna do you any good is, I think, very counterproductive and certainly very different from the traditional patterns in African American society where education was the be all and end all.  And then if you can do anything else, you could get an education.  And even if you had to do it by lamplight in a shotgun cabin, you could be educated.  I think that's been lost to a large extent and to our detriment.  So I still think the early childhood problem, it's a time when parents are most vulnerable to information about child rearing and to their hopes and fears for their kids.  And I just think it's an ideal time to both provide the children with the education the parent can't give them, and provide the parent with the kind of information they need to be supportive of their children's education.  So I still see an enormous mission for early childhood in the African American community and in the low income communities, not just African American, probably more in the Hispanic community.  I don't know as much about their community.  And, but they certainly are struggling with very much the same kind of issues.  Some of the traditional, cultural patterns aren't conducive to being or getting ahead in a capitalistic society that's heavily dependent on education and how to help people make that transition in less than a generation or two, I think is a major challenge that we have in education today.
Story_ID: 60970
Speaker 1: Head start was really an attempt to popularize or bring early childhood education to the common person?
Speaker 2: No, it was really an attempt to prepare children for school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was an eight-week program designed in the summer to try to get children who came from low-income communities, who traditionally and all over the world, have been less educationally successful than middle-income children.  How could you get them ready for school?  And the notion was, hey, fifteen minutes in the summer will do it.  We had had a number of universities that had instituted experimental programs in pre-school education that had been quite successful in increasing the amount of information and knowledge that children have.  These were year-long programs, however, but the data was used to support the notion of an eight-week program.  And so it was begun by community action agencies being funded to provide an eight-week program.  Well, it soon became apparent that eight weeks wasn't gonna swing it.  But there's a few programs that had been converted ten years around programs that were doing much better.   So then they converted all of them to year-around programs.  My perception is that head start has been devoted primarily to building development support for poor children, making sure that they had adequate nutrition, that they had healthcare, that their--if the parents needed social services, they got them.  If they were psychological services, they were handicapping conditions.  All of these things were a part of the head quart format, and they're call comprehensive services.  It think we really believed that if you took care of all those things, the education would take care of itself.  And over the last 35 years, I think what we've found is that, yes, the kids are healthier, but there're still not more school successful.   And that there still are things in the low-income community and, in particularly, some minority communities, African American communities that mitigate against children being more successful in school, things like vocabulary.  There's a very strong correlation between children's vocabulary and reading comprehension.  Black people talk to each other enough to communicate (laughter).  They manage to say everything they wanna say.  They use a lot of facial expressions, a lot of intonation, a lot of auxiliary forms of communication.  And there's no problems telling somebody what you wanna tell them.  But they don't have very large vocabularies (laughter).  Well, school is dependent on a large vocabulary.  Sure, there's another way to say it with a more restricted vocabulary.  But that's not what school's about.  School's about being more and more precise.  African Americans are not very precise in their language.  They tend to like playing on words.  They--half the words that get used in every-day speech, the slang, comes out of the African American community, in which it's an analogous word.  It's not the--it's not the exact word.  If you're using word in the, an old word, in the new way.  I think "split" is a perfectly good example, meaning to leave.  Everybody gets a big bang out of the fact that it's close enough for its meaning to be clear, but it's not the right word.  And that's the kind of interests, playing the dozens, playing with words.  African American preachers, they may use a word incorrectly if it has the right meter, if it has the right onomatopoeia.  So our interest in vocabulary is fine, and it does, we can do great things with it.  But it isn't gonna make your school successful (laughter).  And so how to communicate to people that your culture is wonderful, it's fine, it works fine, but you need to add on something, is kind of the dilemma that we're in as talk to people who come from cultural backgrounds that aren't supportive of school achievement.  And you don't want 'em to lose the things that are good.  We don't wanna lose the ability to, to create rhythmics because that's been our heritage, and we're very good at it.  But because we focus so exclusively on the sounds of words, I think it does mean that we pay less attention to the exact meaning of words.  And so we need to add that on (laughter).  We need to add it--and the parents aren't gonna change how they talk.  So we need to add that on as a part of the school experience and get the parents just to understand what it is and give their support to it.  And the same is true of children speaking English instead of Spanish.  There's simply nothing wrong with speaking Spanish, but you're gonna go to school where all they speak is English, it's a great handicap (laughter).  How do we help Spanish-speaking families understand that it's good for kids to speak another language, when they know very well that if their children start speaking English, they may stop speaking Spanish.  And that's very painful.
Speaker 1: Okay, we're gonna change tapes.
Story_ID: 60971
Speaker 1: When you--let's go to the Erikson Institute.  In 1966, you come to be affiliated, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, Maria Piers called me and said, I'm--I don't remember, Maria [Piers] or Lorraine [Wallach], one of them called me, and said, "We're thinking about starting a training program for teachers and wondered whether you'd like to come join us."  And I said, "Well, what is it?"  She said, "Well, you know, they're starting this Head Start program.  And they are gonna need teachers, and we thought we would start a training program."  And a friend of Maria's, Irving [B.] Harris, knows Sargent Shriver, and he'll give us some money.  And we could then train teachers in pre-school education.  And so I just, I said, I was about ready to leave child care.  And I said, look--I'd been offered a job at the U-C Hospital and Clinics [University of Chicago Hospital and Clinics], and was trying to decide which way to go and decided I'm much more comfortable not working in the same hospital my husband's working in too.  And early childhood is really where I'm comfortable.  So I said, sure, I'll do that.  And so I quit my job and Sargent Shriver didn't come through (laughter).  And Irving [B.] Harris said, "Well, go on and start it.  And I'll make up any deficits you have."  And so we went ahead and we started the [Erikson] Institute, the three of us.  And Irving [B. Harris], indeed, did and has traditionally come through whenever we needed it.  But surprisingly enough, we have not been desperate many times in our institutional life.  And, but, you know, as Irving [B. Harris]--as time has gone on, Irving has been more and more supportive as has his family.  And part of why we're now an institution ready to grow and be even more influential is the Irving [B. Harris] contributions.  So I don't, don't want to in any way underplay that.  But Maria [Piers] was the person who thought this was such a wonderful idea because she had been down to Nashville [Tennessee] speaking to an AEYC [Association for the Education of Young Children] group which was the professional organization for pre-school teachers.  And she was just appalled at how little they knew about child development.  And so she had mentioned this to Irving [B. Harris] who had gotten interested, and so the notion of bringing child development to early childhood educators instead of bringing in elementary educators who really didn't know anything about little kids, we thought, far better to give them child development and early childhood education.  And so the program was started without any degree, without anything, just people who would like to go and work with little children could come here and get a certificate.  But it didn't take very long before we realized that we needed to give some kind of degree.  And so we started looking for an institution to affiliate with.  And we talked to, I think, all the major institutions.  And Loyola [Loyola University Chicago] turned out to be the best fit because they didn't have anybody in early childhood, and they were willing for us to be independent.  And the president said, we don't have any money and you don't have any money, so it's a great marriage.  And, indeed it was for thirty years.  We were independent.  We based all of our own money and Loyola [University Chicago] gave us support services and gave the degree.  And then about five years ago--well, no, more than that.  I guess it's been almost eight years ago now, they decided that it really was not working out as well for them.  They were having a period of retrenchment and so we decided to go independent.  And so we've been independent for four years.
Story_ID: 60972
Speaker 1: Now, you make it all seem so easy on hindsight, but, I mean it's not that easy always to build institutions and to sustain them.  And I'm just wondering if you could take yourself back to your early years, and what was the vision?  What was-
Speaker 2: Certainly no vision of a long-term institution that would give higher education degrees when we started.  It was going to be a simple training effort.  I often tell my graduate students, "You know, in my day, you didn't think about a career.  You thought about a job."  And the difference now is that women have the opportunity to think about careers.  And you need to think about where you're going and how does this fit in with where you wanna go.  That doesn't mean you don't take chances or you don't go off on a tangent, but you ought to at least think about these sorts of things.  I sure didn't (laughter).  It just seemed like a good plan.  I'd had enough of child care.  This was something new and different.  Why not?  It was also one of the, I think, benefits that women had in my generation where their husbands really freed them from the need to support themselves or to bring in the family support and left them free to do some interesting things they might not have done otherwise.  So in that sense, I have that kind of freedom.  I didn't have to make money.  I didn't have to be a--didn't have to have a retirement plan.  I didn't have to have any of the things that I would have had to have if I'd been a single mom or if I hadn't had a husband that was able to support me.  So we just started it, didn't make much money, didn't have a retirement plan.  Jim [HM James Bowman], I was on Jim's health plan (laughter).  It just was.
Speaker 1: Well, what was the (unclear)-
Story_ID: 60973
Speaker 1: Now, what--but when, I know that here are these, you know, three women deciding they're gonna do this.  What about the curriculum?  How are you thinking--I mean you're teaching, but how are you thinking about, you're gonna--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: We had very close contacts with Bank Street College of Education [New York] which is one of the premier institutions and certainly one of the only institutions in those days that focused directly on young children and had a semi-psychoanalytic perspective as we did.  And the, some of the people from Bank Street [College] came out and actually spent time with us talking about the curriculum.  I had certainly taught early childhood education quite a good deal.  Lorraine [Wallach] had worked with emotionally disturbed children, and Maria [Piers] was a psychologist.  So we kind divvyed up the responsibility for teaching among the three of us.  We hired a couple of people from the University of Chicago to help augment our classes.  And we designed a program that was very much like Sarah Lawrence [College]'s in which there was tutorial and every student had to do some kind of practice work in the community as well as academic classes.  And so kind of, we took the model from Sarah Lawrence [College], of having a Don, and a person--we call 'em an advisor, but having somebody responsible for overseeing your field experience and your education, small group seminars, large group lectures and field work.  And we've experimented with it.  The basic format has stayed pretty much the same.  We keep saying the comp questions are the same, the answers are different, however (laughter).
Speaker 1: Because things have changed?
Speaker 2: Yeah, things have changed.  We know a lot more now than we knew then.
Speaker 1: What were your theories based on then?
Speaker 2: We were very psycho-analytically oriented.  Most early childhood people were, probably a little more biologically oriented than many places because Maria had strong contacts with Jean Piaget, and so in our early days, we had really very outstanding people come and give us--Piaget being one of them, Erik Erikson, Konrad Lorenz, Rene Spitz.  These were people represented a much broader spectrum of thought in child development than just the psychoanalytic one.  As the years have passed, we probably have, we've use the psychoanalytic approach probably more to looking at infant behavior, infant-mother interactions and things like that, than we have the traditional analytic material, become, I think, in (unclear) more biologically oriented, particularly, with the newer biology coming to fore.  And we've made some progress in education.  We've had some very interesting early intervention studies that have made us much wiser about how children learn and how best to set up situations for them to learn in different ways and for different--with different backgrounds.  So we, we're making good progress in understanding better, but that doesn't mean we're not making mistakes now, probably just as big as the ones (laughter) we made in the past, different ones.  But the knowledge base has grown exponentially.  We spend most of our time thinking about what can we leave out rather than what to put in (laughter).  So it's changed.
Speaker 1: When you--how many students were you-
Story_ID: 60974
Speaker 1: So how many students?  What were-
Speaker 2: We started off with fifteen students.  And most of them were one-year students.  Over the years, our students, increasing numbers of them, were--and we started off with women who didn't work.  We now have almost nobody who comes who doesn't have a job.  Most of our students are two-year students.  Many of them are three-year students.  Most of our students are Masters-level students.  They, we have approximately one hundred-fifty of 'em.  We have approximately eighteen doctoral in conjunction with Loyola University [Chicago], and we have approximately ten social work students with Loyola School of Social Work, and we have about twenty undergraduate teachers in cooperation with Columbia College [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: So you started out--this is where I just wanna be clear.  You were a program within a school?
Speaker 2: No, we started off all by ourselves.
Speaker 1: Oh, totally by your--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: No cert--no degree, no anything, just a little meaningless certificate and fifteen students.  And then we affiliated with Loyola University, and we gradually-
Speaker 1: In what year?
Speaker 2: Call it, '70' [1970], '69' [1969] to '70' [1970].  And then we gradually increased our student body to twenty.  Then twenty, into thirty, and we stayed at thirty quite a long time.  And then we added on a second class of thirty, and as I said, people began to stay more than one year.  We have every year, maybe one or two students who do it in one year, but most of them are two and three-year students.  And so we have, you know, over a couple hundred students wandering around the [Erikson] Institute now.  It's a lot different than that fifteen (laughter).
Story_ID: 60975
Speaker 1: Were any of your approach to things viewed controversial in the, you know, or was it, you know, sort of a sign of the time, and you were consistent with the times?
Speaker 2: You know, there really wasn't the "times" (laugher).  I mean it was a very small, early childhood community.
Speaker 1: Was everyone doing pretty much the same--(unclear) (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Yeah, pretty much the same thing, but it was more so in pre-school than in childcare.  Childcare was kind of out of the loop.  They were taking care of kids.  That was about it.  But there was a gradual coming together beginning in the 1960s.  When I first started off, everybody was in nursery school education.  I didn't know anybody in--maybe two or three people, I knew in childcare, worked in settlement houses and they were social workers.  They weren't educators.  But we've grown slowly and steadily until I took over, what, ten years ago, nine years ago, and we doubled and made a real big increase then.  And we've spent this last eight years absorbing that (laughter) and building up our endowment.  So we're kind of on the threshold, probably of another expansion.  And it's, we'll have to figure out which way to go, but there's no question that concern about young children is not going to go away any time soon.  And how we will take care of them and educate their caregivers and teachers, we'll have to figure that out.  But it's gonna happen, and I think Erikson [Institute] is poised as one of the two or three institutions in the country that devotes itself wholly to young children.
Speaker 1: Now, who were the other people around the country that were doing things in this area?
Speaker 2: Bank Street [College of Education, New York] is the traditional place, and Sarah Lawrence [College, New York] has a strong, and had a--even when I was at Sarah Lawrence [College], a strong relationship with Bank Street.  Vassar [College, New York] used to be much more in the forefront than it is now, as was Syracuse [University, New York].  So, you know, there's been some shift.  [University of] North Carolina now probably has more of a leadership role than it used to.  UCLA [University of California Los Angeles].  There're little pockets now around that are focusing in on young children.  But Pacific Oaks [College] in California, and Erikson [Institute] in Chicago, Wheelock [College] in Boston [Massachusetts] and Bank Street [College of Education] are probably the four preeminent institutions in, focusing in on young children.

Speaker 1: And what are the--what things have changed during this time period, you know, that--in terms of either teaching styles or philosophy or approaches?
Speaker 2: I think we've had some shifts from paying more attention to social emotional to paying more attention to cognitive, to coming back to social emotional.  So it's not that what is under consideration has changed.  It is the priorities that are assigned in different times to whether you're focusing primarily on children's cognitive development or you're focusing primarily on children's social emotional development.  And even though we now know those two things work hand-in-hand, they're still kept separate.  And we talk about the social skills children need for school success.  And we talk about the cognitive skills children need for school success.  And the interests goes back and forth between those.  I think that one of the issues that we're resolving now is about readiness for experience.  And there's no question that age and maturation make a difference in what little kids can learn.  But probably less rigid than we used to believe.  So we do know now, for instances, that kids can get better if they do it enough, even though if they don't do it a lot, they won't naturally get better (laughter).  I don't know whether that's clear enough, but, for instance, we know that young children have difficulty taking the perspective of another person.  The standard example is if you give the child a piece of chocolate and a piece of cauliflower and you say, which one do you like the best, the child would obviously say the chocolate.  And then you take the cauliflower and the chocolate, and you say, oh, I love this cauliflower the best of all.  And then you say to the child, now, give me what I like best.  And what does the child give you?  Chocolate, because he can't even entertain the possibility that you would prefer something different from what he prefers.  And then it's somewhere between three and four that they begin to be able to take a perspective of another person.  Well, it turns out, if you show 'em 'Sesame Street' enough, they can begin to take the perspective of Big Bird (laughter).  So things that we would ordinarily say that they can't do, if they have enough time and experience with it, they can do a lot more than we used to think, which means that we shouldn't be quite so fast in saying the kid can't learn this or he can't learn that.  [Cough] Excuse me.  There's this role of experience versus maturation.  It used to be, we used to talk about environment versus heredity.  That's long gone.  Now, we're talking about the relationship of balance between age or maturation and experience in determining what children can and cannot do.  So that's kind of a new thing.  You know, you can't go endlessly.  You can't teach 'em higher mathematics when they're two years old.  But it does seem that you, if the task is going to be, if the task for school is a lot of emphasis on symbolic activities, that the more opportunities kids have at a younger age to engage in symbolic representation, the more likely they are when they get older to be good at it.  So it does make a difference in presenting children with some baseline information about school things, but not in the same way you present it to a four-year old or to a six-year old.  In other words, you can't just take the six-year old curriculum and give it to a two-year old.  But if you want them to be ready for the six-year old curriculum, then there's some things you should start doing when they're two.  I think that's a new idea.  We never thought about, you know, what, what is the learning on which subsequent learning rests.  And now we're doing a lot of thinking.  Well, if you want kids to read when they're seven, we have to pay attention to vocabulary when they're three.  That's kind of a change.  We just thought kids, if you exposed them to everything, they'll learn the vocabulary that they need, and you don't need to do anything else.  Well, it turns out that if you don't use a lot of vocabulary words around them, they won't learn them.  And so you've gotta build that into their life if you want them to be able to read well when they're six or seven years old.  So that's the kind of thinking we're doing now, not the six-year old curriculum at two, but what is--what is the underpinning for something that looks effortless when kids are six or seven, but really is resting on a foundation that we're establishing when they were much younger and simple systems, and vocabulary and the scientific perspective.  All of these things are things that kids begin building at a much younger age than we used to think.

Speaker 1: Now, you did some important studies, I mean, when I say "you" and also the Erikson Institute did some important studies that put you on the map.  Can you talk about some of those?
Speaker 2: Well, most of the work that I personally do is in popularizing or putting together the research in a way that makes sense to practitioners and can be used by practitioners.  And the latest thing that I've been involved with was a report from the National Research Council on Early Childhood Education, called "Eager to Learn" which is an attempt to bring together the child development information we have with the educational research we have, to make recommendations for public policy and practices in early childhood education.  That's the kind of thing I do.  We have another member of our faculty who does primarily social policy work, and he looks at the history of social policy and things like that.  Another one of our faculty members looks at the intervention measures, therapeutic interventions, and he's looking particularly at the relationship between the therapist and the child or the adult who's being treated and how they give the, in interaction between is framed partially by the client and partially by the worker, and how that works itself out.  That's particularly important as we look at early childhood because it seems as if the child's relationship with the mother predicts a lot about mental health and other relationships.  Similarly, the child's relationship with his pre-school teacher predicts the relationship with the kindergarten teacher, which in turn predicts the ease with which he learns to read.  So all of these things are interconnected, and as a faculty, although I think we ascribe to a more developmentalist perspective, each of us pursues our own interests and mine's in education.
Story_ID: 60978
Speaker 1: And, but out of that, you have sort of a consistent theory coming out of the Erikson Institute.  That's what--(unclear) (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'd say we're basically--I think everybody subscribes to a constructionist theory of development.  That means that kids have to struggle with things and make it their own.  It just doesn't pour in, that interactions between adults or older people and children help socialize them into a community's ways of thinking and acting, that relationships make a difference, that it is interaction between social emotional and cognitive that accounts for kids' learning.  Those are things I think we all accept.  You'll probably find some minor difference between them.  Probably, even more important than that is the role of culture in children's thinking and learning.  And that cuts across every component of development, and we even offer a single course.  I mean everybody cuts across it, and then we offer a course in culture because I don't really know Erik Erikson's work, but he was a psychologist who promoted the motion of stages in people's lives.  And everybody assumes that's why we named the institute after him, but it's not.  The reason we named the institute the Erikson Institute is he was one of the first psychologist who could talk about the interface between culture and development and that to think about development outside of culture is almost impossible.  And so that has been one of our distinctive features, I guess.  Everybody talks about culture, but we really do pay attention to the interface between and development.
Speaker 1: And when you talk about culture, you talk about it different from race or do they-at the same time--okay (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, race is just--race is a social definition of skin color.  It has it really doesn't have any of the biological or any social implications aside from what people attribute to it.  You know, we talk about the African American community, but it's certainly not a homogenous community as you've pointed out.  And the color of their skin is relatively unimportant in where they are placed in that community or--but you go to some places in South America, and the color of your skin is a very firm, social--has very firm social implications and defines culture.  It's much more generic here, and that probably social classes, and has been since the Civil War.  And more important, at first it was whether you were free or not.  And then it was, your social class is much more distinctive in terms of defining your culture than your, your race, I mean your color (laughter).
Story_ID: 60979
Speaker 1: Now, at one time--I just wanna go back to chronology a little bit.  At sixty--at sixty-six [1966], it started, '69' [1969], '70' [1970] is when you affiliated with Loyola [University Chicago].  When did you become accredited?  Was that around that time?
Speaker 2: No, we sub--we became accredited two years ago [2000].
Speaker 1: Two years, okay-
Speaker 2: --finally.
Speaker 1: Okay, I see.
Speaker 2: But we've been on the road, maybe three years ago.  Time goes fast when you're having fun.
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: I think it's been two or three years, and you have to be independent before you can get accredited, so-
Speaker 1: I see.  Okay.
Speaker 2: It's been about--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: So your accreditation, I mean the, the degree came through Loyola.
Speaker 2: It came from Loyola [University Chicago].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they gave us, I think two years in the intermediary stage where we were independent, but they kept on giving the degree.  And then we started giving it, our own degree--anybody that was in the system could choose until two years ago.  And now we give everybody the same degree.
Speaker 1: At one point in time, oh dear, okay--at what point in time did you--I just have a few more questions, but what point in time did you decide that this is, we definitely want to build an institution?  You know, that, I mean-
Speaker 2: Once I could say it happened, (unclear) (simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: And it never-
Speaker 2: Just, you know, and keep on plodding forward, keep on--I think, you know, maybe fifteen years ago we began to think about it as having an enduring life.  But even that was, you know, we never knew from one year to the next whether we would exists or not.  We didn't have any money in the bank.  It was all dependent on if we ran a deficit, would Irving [B. Harris] cover it?  So it was not a, it was not a well thought out business plan.  You wouldn't wanna put your money (laughter), put your money with us if you were trying to find a business plan.  It just limped forward by the "yes, and by golly", taking advantage of opportunities when they happened, being in the forefront.  I think, you know, my early interest in the professional organization, through Mrs. [Oneida] Cockrell, was an important thing because it brought me to the attention of the national community.  And so Erikson [Institute] was sitting at the table long before our size ought to have put us there.  There's just been a number of things like that.  Maria [Piers]'s not--because she went to school with Erick [Erikson] and [Jean Piaget] and all these people in Vienna [Austria], they were more than delighted to come over and be supportive of us when we first started.  So we had, you know, people who were legendary in their field coming to give lectures and be at Erikson [Institute].  So a lot of just happenstance, luck, and hard work, that you enjoyed.  I think we all loved it, and we picked people to come.  Almost everybody that's ever worked Erikson has stayed.  We (laughter) don't have, nobody leaves because of the opportunities to be creative and to do good work and it does not exist very often and not be involved in a whole bunch of academic falderal and backbiting and one thing or another.  It's a wonderful place to work.  It's a community.  Our challenge is to maintain that as we grow larger and more conservative and more conventional.  Can we maintain the same kind of interests of both students and faculty that we've been able to create so far.
Speaker 1: Okay, let's change tapes--
Story_ID: 60980
Speaker 1: Now, you assumed the presidency when, of the Erikson Institute?
Speaker 2: Well, the first time I was acting president was in, I don't know, '80-something', '80' [1980], '82' [1982], somewhere along in there.  Then we went out and did a search, and we got another president, Jim Garborino, and he came and stayed nine years.  And then I took over again [1994-2001].  And this time, we didn't go do another search.  I just kept it until about a year and a half ago, two years ago, we started a search, and we now have a new president, Sam Meisels.
Speaker 1: Now, what are you proud of that occurred under your presidency?
Speaker 2: I think we grew enormously, and we consolidated the growth.  It was harder than I had anticipated.  I thought, well, we'll just be the same institution with twice as many people.  And it didn't turn out to be that easy.  We had to expand the finance department, the fundraising, everything had to grow.  And we probably were not, didn't--I certainly had no idea of what we needed to do in order to accommodate that growth.  So we had to grow by guess and by golly.  Technology, huge investment in, and, you know, nothing that we had expected ten years ago.  I thought, well, you know, our first computer lab had three computers in it.  We now have a computer lab with an attended person, with I don't know fourteen computers, and it's filled all day long, every day.  So the investment in computer technology has been just enormous and continuous, and very difficult.  Our library wasn't big enough.  We used Loyola [University Chicago]'s library.  Now, we have a library of our own.  So we had to invest an enormous amount of money in a new library.  Just the support services for students.  I mean Loyola [University Chicago] covered a lot of that sort of stuff, the insurance, health insurance, all those sorts of things that one doesn't think specifically about until you have to provide them.  And then you have to go out and get bids, and you have to pick the best bid.  And it--there was a lot more work in the business office than we had ever anticipated.  We expanded the space.  So somebody had to spend almost full time with the build-out people, trying to get the space organized the way it needed to be organized.  It turned out to be far more than just take twice as many students (laughter), and it'll be all right.  And as I said, the students are straggling out over three years now instead of two, which means that we had many more at any one time.  So the finance, tuition payments, all these sort of things become much more complicated than they used to be.
Story_ID: 60981
Speaker 1: How much did you raise during that period of time?
Speaker 2: We raised, during the time I was president, eleven and a half million dollars.
Speaker 1: That's very impressive.
Speaker 2: Yes, it was, a small-
Speaker 1: So you proved to be an adept fundraiser and--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Well, our board proved to be an adept fundraising (laughter) institution, yes.  They've been very, very good.  And-
Speaker 1: Was that the board--had that board already been in place?
Speaker 2: No, we kind of developed the board as well.  We had a board that wasn't used to raising money.  And when we decided we needed to raise money, we obviously needed to have some new board members.  And I think we have a much--our board was always committed, but many of them were not in a position to help raise money.  I think we have a board now that is in a much better position to help us financially themselves, and to help us be in touch with others.  We have always had good luck with foundations, and, you know, we've continued to cultivate our foundation giving.  But you must have a more diverse funding base than we had.  And, you know, if I made a contribution, I think that's probably the one that they will appreciate longer than anything else I did, was I really decided early on, we had to expand, and we had to have a more diverse funding base.  And Irving [B. Harris] was wonderfully supportive of that as an effort.  He's been one of the best fundraisers we've had.  And the rest of the board, as I said, and "Heave-to," and we now have a board that raises money and knows how to raise money and is willing to raise money.  And that's a really big asset for an institution, particularly a small institution.  Getting large has been helpful.  People know us, more people know us.  And we've got more of a reputation so it's easier to raise money for somebody that's known than if you're not known (laughter).  And you've probably been through something similar (laughter).  You have to get to a certain stage in order to get people to fund you.
Speaker 1: You make it seem easy (unclear) it's nice (laughter).  No, because, you know, people who come up from academia don't necessarily know how to raise money (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: That's right.  Absolutely-
Speaker 1: --so that's what I'm saying.  That's a skill.
Speaker 2: --not.  We don't-
Speaker 1: You're very modest about that.
Speaker 2: Well, we don't even think about it.  You know, who cares how you get the money.  Just pay my salary.  And I think, I've also educated faculty as we've gone along.  And as they move into a more definitive status in the institution, and there's, you know, we've operated as a big family.  And faculty, the dean was head of the faculty.  The faculty didn't have any life, and didn't have any representation outside of the dean.  They're now getting, you know, much more formal and representatives and they have prerogatives and tenure and all the other things that go along with academic life.  I think they are wiser about what some of the issues are, simply because they're all friends of mine.  And, you know, I talked endlessly about what we needed to do and when we needed to do it.  And they do have an appreciation for the fact that you've gotta raise money if you wanna do some of these things and that a faculty have an obligation to get out there and help do it.
Story_ID: 60982
Speaker 1: The other thing that was also your hallmark was really moving into technology.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, and I mean that's, you--'cause a lot of times people, as they get older, they don't necessarily wanna move into another--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Well, interestingly enough, I started off doing a pilot project, God, twenty years ago, twenty-five years ago maybe.  When we got our first computer at home, my niece whose now, what, twenty-one, so she was two.  So it's nineteen years ago, we have our first computer.  And she came by and was so intrigued.   We could--the computer would play, I don't know, 'Three Blind Mice' or something if you hit the right keys.  And she just was intrigued with, and every time she came to the house, she wanted to play on the computer.  And I got to thinking that, here is this child playing on a computer.  And all the poor children in the world don't even know what a computer is.  And so I had a former student who was teaching out at Olive-Harvey [College, Chicago, Illinois], and I said to her, "Let's see what we can teach kids using technology."  And she said, "Oh, that was a good idea."  They had a technology lab out at the college, and she could get somebody to help her.  And we got somebody to donate a computer or two--I think we had two computers.  And in those days, we had a Logo program which was a--it doesn't matter.  It's a software program, much too difficult for little kids.  But we put it, loaded it up and see what the kids could learn.  Well, we found they couldn't learn Logo, but we found, number one, that their parents were absolutely enthralled with the fact that they were computer users.  And these were mostly low-income kids who were going to community colleges, and they were just so proud--my child uses a computer.  So the, the notion that the artifacts that people can use as a status symbol came through very early for us.  It didn't make any differences whether they--it's like a telephone.  Just having it in the house, you didn't have to--it worked.  Owning a telephone was a status thing and said something about you and your family (unclear).  So anyhow, that was one of the things that came out of it.  Secondly, even though the children couldn't master the software program, they did learn the vocabulary.  They did get the notion that something was happening that they didn't quite understand, but that they had some control over.  They learned the procedures, turn the computer on and to get it, loaded it up and do all those sorts of things, and they were faster than some of the adults were in learning some of the procedural things.  The Logo program, it's a graphics program, and one of the things that you can do is by--the longer, the higher the number that you enter in, the longer a line becomes, and the kids discovered that if you enter in enough numbers, the line got so long, it would go around the computer and come back on the other side.  And the notion that you could have a line that went into infinity, as we would tell them, and come back again, was very interesting to them.  Well, that's an idea that, you know, you don't expect sixth graders to get, but the kids were able to do it graphically and show that this line could get so long, it could come back again (laughter).  So the whole notion of going to the moon and coming back, all these things that seem terribly complex when it's, you know, seven billion, nine hundred-fifty billion miles away, you can go and come back.  Suddenly, even little four-year olds were able to get on the notion that some of these numbers (unclear) not, I mean it didn't go--infinity didn't have to be infinity.  It could--you could come back from large numbers.  Anyhow, so there were some things like that, that we were able to demonstrate that kids could learn.  So that was when it came across to me that their teachers ought to know something about it if they're going to be able to teach the kids something about it.  And so I began teaching technology in one of my classes, not--I had one lecture (laughter), and then gradually extended and extending it, and then convinced the then president, we needed to have a computer lab and raise some money for this three-computer lab (laughter).  And then we began to give courses to teachers on how to use technology themselves, and then we extended to thirteen computers, I think.  And then we began to give classes in how you can use technology or software programs with little kids, and we just expanded and expanded.
Speaker 1: And you've had also, pushed to--do a lot of teaching or learning--instruction.  Hasn't there been--'cause the young guy you sent to talk to me-
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --he had been instrumental-
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was the one who set up the original software or hardware network and then put us--our lab in and bought the equipment and he wasn't involved in the teaching part of this.  And the faculty did that, but he was the one who really kept us and informed us about what we could do and what we couldn't do and how we could do.  So he was a very important person, and he didn't start out--I mean we all learned from scratch.  He was--what I liked about Adam was that he was willing to take on these jobs and try to figure out how to do them.
Speaker 1: We had gone to the same university, (unclear) Williams [College, Massachusetts] and Brandeis [University, Massachusetts]-
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 60983
Speaker 1: --but, you know, the other--I have some questions to ask around the African American community.  And when you started working, you know, there was really, poverty was the main issue, surrounding the African American community.  There wasn't the prevalence of drugs.  And I'm just wondering, what is the, you know, what is--and there were common perceptions around race and learning.  What are, what do you, when--you know, as you look from now into the future, what do you see, what are the issues you see facing this community and what are the thoughts about how to handle those issues?
Speaker 2: Well, I think one of the issues is that it's gonna be increasing difficult to be in a community.  As, just as white people have had an increasing bifurcated sector community, the African American community is going to be increasing diverse.  There're going to be people who are making with money.  There're gonna be people who are doing good work socially.  There're gonna be people--and they're not all gonna live in the same neighborhood anymore.  And they're not gonna all share the same values in the same sense that we did before.  So, you know, when I was a kid growing up, it didn't make any difference whether your father was unemployed or your, was a banker.  You all lived in the same community, and you shared some values in common, maybe not all of 'em, but you sure shared a lot more than commonly you're, shared now in what is broadly called the African American community.  So I think it's gonna be increasingly difficult to maintain a sense of community as people feel themselves separated from other members of the community.  I was particularly aware of this a number of years ago and was talking to a young couple who lived in one of the suburban communities.  And I was saying that they had originally belonged to one of the black churches in town.  I said, "You need to come back and, you know, be involved.  And listen, we have all we can do.  We moved out of the city in order to be able to establish a different kind of life for ourselves and our children.  And now you want us to come back and bring our kids with us?"  And it suddenly struck me that what they were saying was, you know, we moved away from being poor (laughter).  We don't wanna be poor anymore.  We don't wanna live in that community.  We don't want our kids to grow up in that community anymore.  And I think this ghettoization is common in America today.  I mean it's represented by single-class suburbs, by gated communities.  Everybody seems to be trying to pull themselves into a smaller, smaller cohort of people just like them.  And I think that's gonna be very difficult to maintain a community as people feel themselves more encapsulated in smaller units.  I think it's inevitable that we're seeing more intermarriage.  Certainly, the Jewish community is trying to struggle with this now when more than half of the community is out marrying.  How do you raise your kids to be, feel inward, when they're now, you know, feeling Jewish and Japanese (laughter).  So I think that's another part of being different.  It used to be if you married out of the African American community, your kids were African American.  I have a cousin who's married to a--has a child by a white woman.  And we simply never had any question the boy was black.  And he is now, maybe twenty-five years old, and he says, you know, it's still hard for him to say he's only black.  And to me that seems absolutely incredible.  I mean how can he be anything but black?  But he still feels some sense of identity with his mother and I understand intellectually (laughter).  So his commitment is not as complete as it would have been in my generation.  In my generation, there'd been no question at all.  This is a black child.  I remember once being up in an Indian community in the far Northwest, Nez Perce, and the young man who met me at the airport was a young black man.  And he was driving me back to the reservation.  I said, well, how did you happen to get onto the reservation, thinking that he was a school teacher or something.  He says, "What do you mean?"  And I said, "Well, when did your family come to (laughter) reservation?"  He says, "My family is the reservation.  I live on the reservation."  I said, "What do you mean?"  He said, "I'm a member of the tribe."  And I said, "Oh, I'm sorry.  I thought you were African American."  He said, "No, I'm Indian."  And I thought to myself, God, you would never have heard that a generation ago.  You couldn't, you were African American, even if you were part Indian.  So, the point is that the world has changed, and we're more bifurcated than we used to be.  And I think it will be increasingly difficult to hold together as a community, as discrimination decreases--if it does, that people will be more willing to let go of the strength that comes from binding together as a community.  And their kids will feel like members of two and three different communities, not just one.  And the loyalty to one community will be diffused.  So I think that's a challenge.  How do you do that without cutting down people's options and without saying, you know, don't go out.  (Laughter) Stay here in your community, and stay with us.  I think that is a real dilemma.  I don't know the answer to it and certainly know that my grandchild is far more comfortable in multiple worlds than either her--and we had more experience than most people.  She doesn't have the same sort of identification that we had, and [HM] Valerie [Jarrett] probably doesn't have a stronger one as we had either.  So the world is changing, and we're gonna change with it, and that is inevitable.  And the question simply is, how do we maintain the commitment to people who are less fortunate.  And I guess that's the place where I see us needing to work with our children, and it doesn't make any difference who they are.  If they're less fortunate than you are, you've got a commitment, you've got a human commitment to them.  And everybody has a responsibility to give back if not to this particular community, to some community that needs you.
Story_ID: 60984
Speaker 1: So do you believe that the sense of identity plays more of a role or has--instilling in someone a sense of identity, you know, and the less fortunate, you know, when you look at the black community?
Speaker 2: No, I think your sense of identity arises out of the way you get treated, and so to the extent that people don't treat you badly, you have less reason to pull back on your home community, that if people find that they should get out of the ghetto easier and go into another ghetto, I must say (laughter), but into a larger community where you have more resources and more opportunities, they're gonna do it.  And I'm not sure I want to say to them, don't do it.  Remember your ties, remember your roots, remember your past.  You can remember your past so much, it constrains your future.  So there's a balance there between being proud of your past and feeling that your past gives you some strength and feeling like you can't get away from your past.  I think we sometimes have taken slavery and its lessons too much to heart (laughter).  We need to let go of some of those slavery lessons.  So the world is not gonna be like it was when I was a kid.  And that's both too bad, and too good.  Valerie sometimes says that even her generation, although they had the cousins that she says, they didn't have the larger community like we did where everybody went to three-generation parties, and, you know, you were a member of a community by birth right practically.  That kind of close-knit community is long gone.
Story_ID: 60985
Speaker 1: Now, what are your then hopes or concerns for the black community?  Do you have those?  I mean you talk-
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.
Speaker 1: --very cogently about the melting pot, and that sort of eventuality, but-
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it's a long way from here, and in the meantime, I think we do have a responsibility to help as many people as possible take advantage of whatever opportunities there are out there.  And at this point, young black children are not getting a chance.  They're being cut off at the knees before they get to first grade.  And I think there are some relatively simple things that, as a community, we could do.  I think the African American church isn't doing anywhere near what it could be doing.  We could be giving lectures on child development from the pulpit instead of on the afterlife.  Don't get me started on that one (laughter).  But I just think that there are community organizations that aren't doing as much as they could be doing to reinforce the positive things that could be happening in the community.  And, you know, I'm not big on process.  I know it has to happen, but I want it to happen while I can see it.  So I, let's short circuit the process and get it on the road (laughter).  We need to, we need to be moving people forward so that we don't end up twenty-five years from now as still the underrepresented group everywhere while the Hispanics have, you know, long sense passed us, and, you know, there's no question.  We have a disadvantage of being visible, but we can take that disadvantage and get it to work on our behalf or we can continue to feel that we can't do anything because we are black.  And I think we have to take what strength we can from one another, but also move as a community into a position of greater strength.  And the only way we're gonna have any strength is by voting, getting money (laughter), getting richer (laughter) and banding together.  And so I'm, I'm unambivolent in my message to African Americans.  It, so far, that's the vision for fifty years from now, but right now, you'd better try to help out your church down there in the black community because as [HM] John Johnson says, "you're still a nigger".

Speaker 1: Do you think your father would be turning over in his grave if he could see the community today?
Speaker 2: I think he would have probably turned over more in the '60's [1960s] than he (laughter) did in the, than he would now (laughter).  I think he would have, and particularly, the denigration of education.  He would have thought that was absolutely the most ridiculous thing he'd ever heard in his life or the fact that you would have housing projects with no rules about who could live there and let people run the property down.  He would have died if people--he could have seen the Rosenwald people, the Rosenwald [Apartments] building the way people had run the property down.  That would have just been absolutely appalling to him.  But on the other hand, he probably would have been on the cutting edge of the entrepreneurial movement was in the African American community.  He would have been, he'd probably gotten rich (laughter) if he'd had time enough.  He would have taken advantage of opportunities in private enterprise.  That would have interested him.
Speaker 1: He would have died to have seen Robert Taylor [Housing Projects] in its present shape.
Speaker 2: Died.  Well, he would have died to have seen it in its original state--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 1: Original state--(unclear) (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: He was a great believer in small projects where you taught people how to live in the city.  He said, you know, it doesn't come natural.  He came from the rural.  He said, "It isn't natural to live in the city.  You gotta learn to live in the city, what a dumbwaiter is for (laughter)."  He used to always, you know, the Rosenwald [Apartments] Building had dumbwaiters.  People used to just drop the garage down instead of pulling the dumbwaiter up and putting it in the can and sending it down.  It sent him crazy.  He said, "People have to learn."  He had people who went around to apartments and show people how to use the dumbwaiter system because he felt like people would not, wouldn't know that.  People who had been living in the rural South or people who had even been living in Chicago [Illinois], in houses, they didn't know anything about dumbwaiters, and how you live in an entranceway and how you keep the lobby clean and all these sorts of things weren't part of the experience of most African Americans.  So, no, he, he was a firm believer that you had to teach people how to do these things, and that they were worth doing.
Speaker 1: Now, what do you think your father would have thought had he been able to see the progress you have made?
Speaker 2: He would have been delighted, absolutely, delighted even more delighted with [HM] Valerie [Jarrett].  He really liked the notion of a woman--and since he only had girls, he had no choice (laughter).  But he liked the idea that we would be competent, that we would be able, that we would earn money, enough money to support ourselves.  He was, you know, one of--and insisted that I had to get a job when I got married, that I couldn't just go sit and do nothing because my husband could afford to support me.  I had to get a job and get back in school and be energetic and involved.  And his requirement for me to do that was just as strong as if I'd been a boy.  His sisters were all well-educated.  His mother's sisters were all educated.  His aunt was a, a pharmacist and had a degree in French from [Universite] Sorbonne [Paris, France] and then went and got a social work degree from Columbia [University, New York].  So, you know, it was, his notion of women and what they ought to do was that you ought to be educated and involved.
Speaker 1: Does that exist much in your family discussion about your legacy and it's, you know, from--why, you think?
Speaker 2: I think it's partly female.  One doesn't talk--women don't talk about their achievements.  That's a feminine perspective.  Men can talk about their achievements, but women don't talk about their achievements.  It's not quite nice.  Probably, I don't ever talk about it very much at home or socially.  That's not--I guess, I guess it's feminine, I don't know.  Certainly, I don't know any women who laud what they do and when you're at home, you're "Mrs." (laughter) in my generation.  I think it's changed a lot today.  More women, more women are not married and they have identities of their own, outside of their fathers and their husbands.  But, you know, I went from my father's house to my husband's house.  I've never been an independent woman.
Speaker 1: But you have your own identity.  So the-
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  I had that the day I was born (laughter), but I've never been not dependent in the traditional sense of the word.  And that was what women did.  And so, my mother was very much involved, but she didn't talk about what she did.  Maybe it was her influence.  Women's jobs were not important.  Men's jobs were important.

Speaker 1: What do you want to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: Realistically, having lived (laughter).  I don't think, you know, being remembered is not big on my list of things.  You're lucky if you are and if you're remembered for anything reasonably nice, you're really luck.  I think you, you know, you live on a little bit in your family for a year or two (laughter), not too long.  Sometimes you make a long-term contribution.  But there are many, many people who did wonderful things when they were alive, and nobody even knows their name today.
Speaker 1: That's the problem.
Speaker 2: The problem.
Speaker 1: That is the problem, but what about, then if you're gonna intend to be, because I usually ask a legacy question.  But I wanna ask that about your family and the legacy of your family and how you feel-
Speaker 2: I think that's probably much more alive and well.  I think all the kids in the family are very much aware of the fact that there is a family legacy that we hope that they will make it--they will extend it in some way and make us equally proud of their contribution to it.  I hope it isn't an albatross, but I do think that it is a responsibility.  I mean I certain felt it.  I think [HM] Valerie [Jarrett] has always felt it.  I hope Laura will.  I think she is proud of her family, but I don't know if she makes a lot--she doesn't venerate us in any (laughter) sense of the word, like I did my grandfather [Robert Robinson Taylor].  My grandfather was, was somebody.  She doesn't, Papa [Robert Rochon Taylor] and Mommy were just the family, and she orders Jimmy around like he's a chauffeur (laughter).  But I think appreciates the fact that we and other family members, older family members, take time with her.  Whenever there're family gatherings, everybody does get to know the kids in the family and that we have an investment in all of them.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's it.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
