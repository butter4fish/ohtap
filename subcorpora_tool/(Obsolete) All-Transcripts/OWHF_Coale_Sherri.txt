 Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Wednesday, August 29, 2007 and I   m in Norman,  Oklahoma, interviewing Sherri Coale. This interview is being conducted  as part of the Inductees of the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame Oral  History Project. Sherri Coale was inducted into the Oklahoma Women   s  Hall of Fame in 2007. She is entering her twelfth season as  Women   s  Basketball  Head Coach at the University of Oklahoma. Thank you for  joining us today, Coach Coale.  Let   s begin by learning more about you. Let   s begin with where you  grew up and a little background on your early life.  I grew up in Healdton, Oklahoma, a small oil field town that   s less  populated now than it was when I was there twenty-some odd years ago.  Great place to grow up, a typical small town. I was involved in  absolutely everything from our church, to our school, to our community.  I still have a lot of really, really important relationships there.  Now as you   re growing up, tell me about some of the schools you  attended.  Healdton was just Healdton. We had Sunset Elementary, and then I went  to Healdton High School. And after I graduated from high school I  received a full scholarship to play basketball at Oklahoma Christian  College, where I went from    83 to    87 and graduated with a degree in  English education and physical education.  Now when you   re younger, what were some of the subjects that you were  most interested in.  Oh, English. I loved to read so literature was big. Never was really a  5  Nykolaiszyn  Coale  Nykolaiszyn  Coale  Nykolaiszyn  Coale  Nykolaiszyn  Coale  Nykolaiszyn  Coale  math or science girl   I kind of had the other brain. Got into Nancy  Drew mysteries when I was about in the fifth grade, and read every  single one that was in our little library. At the middle school, it was a  converted closet   it really was a huge closet, just lined with books. And  then, I began to branch out from there. I bought books at garage sales     anywhere I could find them, I bought books. I just love to read.  Now outside of school what did you like to do for fun growing up?  Play ball, (Laughs) 24/7. Basketball, a little softball, more baseball than  softball. I had an older brother   a lot of football in the front yard, both  touch football and tackle with full pads, we did the whole deal     Wow.  Yeah. I was very much a tomboy and lots of basketball. I really got  serious into basketball about six or seventh grade, and spent almost  every spare moment either on the outdoor court on the driveway or at the  gym.  Now when you were growing up did you think that you were going to  become a basketball coach, is that what you wanted to be?  I wanted to be a teacher. As I got further into basketball in junior high  and high school, I decided that I would also like to be a coach, because  the most influential people in my life outside of my immediate family  were my coaches and teachers. So when I went to college, I said,    I want  to be a basketball coach and I think I want to teach English along with  that.    So it was teacher first, then it switched into basketball and then  there was a healthy marriage of the two.  Now when you were younger, who were some of your role models that  you looked up to?  Well my fifth grade basketball coach was really my first hero. She was  our English teacher and she was our basketball coach. She was married  and had two kids. She was a beautiful lady, and I just thought, you  know, she had it all. She was a woman, she was an athlete, she was a  coach, she was a teacher, she was a professional, she was a mother, and  she was really my first hero. Her name is Mary Patton, and she   s a  season ticket holder at the University of Oklahoma now, so how about  that.  Is she still coaching?  No, no she   s been retired for years and lives outside of Ada, and makes  6  Nykolaiszyn  Coale  Nykolaiszyn  Coale  Nykolaiszyn  Coale  all of our home games.  That   s awesome. Now tell me a little bit about your family.  Raised in Healdton, my parents were divorced when I was really young.  But both of them lived in Healdton, so I was able to go back and forth  and to have as normal of a divorce life as you could possibly have. I  didn   t know any different. Both of them were very, very involved with  my school activities as I was growing up. My grandparents   my  mother   s mom and dad were very influential. They lived there in  Healdton as well. My Granny actually now lives with me here in  Norman. She   s lived with me a little over ten years now, so that   s been  neat to kind of go full circle with that. And my children have had the  very extraordinary impact of getting to know their great-grandmother  extremely well.  So family plays a big role in your life, both then and now.  Oh sure, absolutely.  You said you went to college at Oklahoma Christian, can you describe  what it was like being there as a student?  Yeah, Oklahoma Christian was a great experience for me. It was really  the perfect place and the perfect time for me. It was a lot bigger than  Healdton, not nearly as big as the University of Oklahoma, obviously,  but it was a very challenging academic environment. It was a neat place  because all of the instructors knew your name. Everywhere you went on  campus   as a student athlete I suppose probably more so than a typical  student, but everybody knew you. The cafeteria workers knew you,  professors in colleges that you didn   t take any classes in still knew you  as a student athlete. And so, it was a very close, tight-knit group.  Every day at ten o   clock we went to chapel. No matter what, you  stopped what you were doing. You went to the auditorium and sang a  couple of hymns, said a prayer, listened to a short sermon and went on  about your day. And at the time, you know, when you   re in college you  think,    Oh I can   t believe I have to go to chapel. I could write this paper,  I could eat a cinnamon roll, I could do this, I could do that, I could take a  nap   ,    you know, sleep is a premium. But as you get a little bit older  you realize that that might have been the best part of every day. And I  wonder sometimes as in this job, would we all be just a little bit better if  we stopped at ten o   clock and thought about things that really mattered  for about twenty or thirty minutes and then went back to work. We   d  probably all be a little bit more efficient so they might be on to  something there. But I played basketball and I had a great career there.  7  Nykolaiszyn  Coale  Nykolaiszyn  Coale  Nykolaiszyn  Coale  Nykolaiszyn  Coale  We played in front of packed gyms on a consistent basis and just had a  wonderful experience.  What was it like making that transition from playing high school to  college for you?  Oh, it was incredibly difficult for me. I played six on six in high school.  Thank goodness, I was a forward   I got to shoot. So I wasn   t too much  behind the 8-ball. But I   ll never forget my first practice when we were  playing five on five, and they were setting all these screens on me and I  couldn   t keep up with my guy. I   m like,    I don   t even know how to  guard.    I played pick-up with the guys a ton, but nobody set screens in  pick-ups, you just go and play. And so they had a good laugh which they  were accustomed to doing for those of us who came out of Oklahoma  were all playing six on six at the time.  Now in college did you plan on becoming a teacher?  Yes, yes. I wanted to teach English and was really interested in writing  and teaching writing to young people and it was a passion that flourished  while I was at Oklahoma Christian as well.  Did you feel that there were opportunities waiting for you in  professional basketball at that time?  No, I didn   t even think about opportunities at the Division I level. I just  wanted to teach and coach kids. High school was all that I really knew,  and then obviously had the collegiate experience. But it didn   t even  really cross my mind to be coaching at the collegiate level. I wanted to  be a high school teacher and a coach.  Okay, so take me now from graduating to your first job.  Right out of college I got a job at Edmond Memorial High School. I was  an assistant basketball coach and assistant volleyball coach. I had never  watched a game of volleyball in my life. I was an assistant volleyball  coach and I used to say,    Bump, set, hit  Let   s go       That   s all I said,  over and over. Had to learn how to drive a bus, a stick shift   big yellow  bus. I taught five hours of senior English and was four years older than  all of my students. I had no planning period and I said,    Yes  I   ll take  that job     I just jumped right at it. I didn   t know any better. But it was a  wonderful experience, mainly because of the people at Edmond  Memorial High School at the time.  Edmond was only one school, and just had fabulous people, from the  superintendent, to the principal, to the guidance staff there at the high  8  Nykolaiszyn  Coale  Nykolaiszyn  Coale  Nykolaiszyn  Coale  Nykolaiszyn  Coale  school, to the coaches of various sports    just a great first opportunity  for me, because I had such an opportunity to learn from such amazing  people.  And you jumped from there to Norman High School.  Yes.  And what was that like for you?  That was the biggest jump because I   as you get out of college and you  go into an assistant coaching role   taking over my classroom was one  thing, but being an assistant coach, you follow along and you do the  things the head coach asks you to do or believes in, and you   re not  responsible for anything really. At the end of the day if the team loses or  a player develops or doesn   t develop, you may feel that personally, but  the buck doesn   t stop with you as an assistant coach.  When I took the job in Norman, it was completely different. It was  suddenly all up to me. And that was a huge adjustment, one I was ready  for and excited about and jumped in with both feet, but it was a big step.  I guess I was what, twenty-six years old? I think I was twenty-six. Wait I  might have been twenty-four, I think I was twenty-four. At the time I  was the youngest 6A coach in the state of Oklahoma, and not much  older than my students, obviously. But again, Norman, just the people,  from Nancy O   Brien who was our superintendent, to Dan Quinn and  David Gore and just, fabulous people   Tony Robinson was the boy   s  basketball coach   people who helped teach me how to do my job, and it  was just a blessing to be in the midst of those people.  During your time there in Norman, with Norman High School you led  the team to two championships?  Mm-hmm.  What was that like for you?  Gee, it   s hard to put into words what it   s like   one of the most  rewarding experiences ever. We went into my first season at Norman  High   we were eleven and twelve. We won eleven games and lost  twelve and everybody was really, really excited because they thought we  were good. I was like,    Okay, I haven   t lost eleven games in the last six  years combined   I know this is not good.    It was changing perception  and I think that   s probably the most rewarding part of it. By the time I  left Norman High seven years later, the coolest thing you could do was  play girls basketball. And the expectation level for the girl   s team every  9  Nykolaiszyn  Coale  Nykolaiszyn  year was to win the last game they played. To see that perception change  and that bar raise was just an incredibly rewarding experience.  Now, you made the jump and a few coaches have, from high school right  into D1 basketball. Was that overwhelming for you? Were you shocked?  Were you in awe? Were you ready for the challenge?  I was too busy to be in shock or awe. I think I was ready for the  challenge. I tell young coaches now,    I don   t necessarily recommend  that path because, boy   the learning curve is steep.    I was fortunate  because I was in place that was familiar. I think that made a big  difference. I didn   t have to sell a house, I didn   t have to buy a house, I  didn   t have to find childcare, my personal life was able to continue in a  steady form while my professional life changed dramatically. And I  don   t know if you move in from another place, I don   t know how you do  that, really. So I did at least have some foundation there that I was able  to operate from, but it was a huge jump.  Again, people   Marita Hines as the point person, just making sure I  knew everything I needed to know on a daily basis. But it was   I look  back at it. You do this a lot, the older you get. You look back on periods  in your life and go,    Now, how did I do that? What in the world     I had  a brand new baby and a son who was four   a brand new baby girl and  this job and I would just stay up all night and literally feed my baby girl  and she would sleep in the little basket next to me on the floor, and I  would work. I had big pieces of butcher paper on the living room floor  and I would create job descriptions and I   d try and figure out all the  tasks there were because there was nothing here. When I got the job,  there was literally nothing here.  I would ask, well the secretary stayed, and    Okay, where are the  assistant coach   s job descriptions?    Well, there weren   t any.    Excuse  me? How do you function? Where's the recruiting list?       We don   t have  one.    And there was nothing, so I really had to start from scratch. I  would just stay up all night and do that, and just kept going. I mean it  was   you look back on it and go,    What in the world?    But I was  driven, and I was excited about, and passionate about it, and you have  that adrenaline and I was, again, surrounded with really good people. I  hired Jan Ross immediately and she was there by my side through the  whole thing helping figure out how to get this thing off the ground.  Can you describe for me   some of learn the skills we need for our  professions in the classroom or through on the job training. Where are  some of the places where you learned the skills you need to do your job  today?  10  Coale  Nykolaiszyn  Coale  Most often simply from paying attention. Watching people who are good  at what they do, it may not even be this business, but watching people  who get it and are good at what they do and learning from them. I   ve  had to learn on the fly a lot in this position, particularly about the  business side of things, because that   s not been my background at all. I  tell people the basketball stuff   s by far the easiest thing that I do.  Basketball   s basketball, you can go down there and teach and that   s  exactly like the court I taught at Norman High. The ceilings may be a  little bit taller and the lights are brighter but otherwise its ninety-four  feet, its basketball.  Everything changed in here  at OU  and it really changed in here  dramatically in 2002. It was a big jump in    96 when I got the job, but  then in 2001 to 2002, the year we went to the national championship  game, it went from being a typical Division 1 program to really being an  elite level program that had a lot more involvement, and it was just   it  exploded, if you will. That was another severe learning curve. So a lot of  learning on the fly, learning from people, reading, paying attention.  Now in women   s basketball, there are a fair amount of men and women  coaches, are you closer with any women   s basketball coaches? Do you  get together and form a support group, or is it just all competition all the  time?  That   s an interesting question, I think by and large, I think coaches of  men   s basketball probably do a better job, men   s sports in general of  sharing than women   s coaches do. I think we   re getting better about it,  but my best friends in the business coach men   s basketball, by far. My  closest friends, the guys that I call when I can   t figure out why we can   t  score, or I can   t figure out why we   re turning the ball over so much,  can   t figure out how to guard Tennessee, or whatever the deal is   the  guys I call are on the men side. And I just have some tremendous friends  who have been an unbelievable help to me, from the word go.  An example of that is, when I first got this job, I called Roy Williams  who was at the University of Kansas. I never met him before in my life,  had no interaction with him whatsoever. And so I just got this job and I  need to figure out   I don   t want to know about your offense and  defense, I mean that   d be great if you want tell me about that too, but I  need to know how to run my office. I need to know what you expect  your staff to do and what   s important and how you organize recruiting.  He didn   t have any time, but he said in the summer, I go visit every one  of my gyms. I think he had fourteen gyms in Lawrence that he used for  his camps, and he made an appearance in every gym every day. He said,     If you want to come to Lawrence and just go with me from gym to gym  and ask me questions, I   d be happy to visit with you about it.    And I  11  Nykolaiszyn  Coale  Nykolaiszyn  Coale  think he probably thought I wouldn   t take him up on it and I said,    I   ll  be there.    So I drove to Lawrence, Kansas and followed him, rode in the  car with him from gym to gym, and went to Wendy   s drive thru, had a  cheeseburger, and asked him four million questions   filled up a legal  pad full. He just told me everything, I mean he would tell me exactly  how they did things, and I really sort of designed my office and built my  staff approach based on what we he did at KU. As a result of those two  days I spent in Lawrence, he   s one of my dearest friends in the business.  You mentioned earlier the    01-   02 season. As a coach, what was it like  playing in the championship game.  It was a little bit surreal, and I know that   s a really vogue word right  now, and overused probably. I remember standing on the floor in the  Alamo Dome after we beat Duke in the semi-final game, and  Connecticut and Tennessee were about to play in the next game. We  were going to find out who our opponent would be and ESPN stopped to  interview Stacey Dales and I. I have a picture   Stacey has her arm  around me, it   s right there in the corner. We   re being interviewed by  ESPN and this side of Alamo Dome starts,    Boomer,    and this side of  the Alamo Dome answers,    Sooner,    and we   re doing an interview on  ESPN live, and it was just one of those out of body experiences where  you go,    Is this really happening?    It was such an emotionally packed  Final Four because it was the anniversary of when this university had  dropped the program. There were lots of individuals who wore red  ribbons   people who had no affiliation with the University whatsoever,  who wore red ribbons in support of our playing in the championship  game, and how quickly a thing can turn, if people are committed to  making it happen. It was just a   it was really an experience filled with  sentiment on a number of levels.  Overall, throughout your career, can you tell me about any stumbling  blocks or adversity that you   ve faced along the way?  Oh, there are stumbling blocks and hurdles every day, every single day.  There are those times I think at every level, you can look back and  there's that defining moment when your program had a chance to go one  direction or the other and typically when you go back to those, it has to  do with young people making really brave courageous choices. I can  remember a practice here at the University of Oklahoma when we had  qualified for the WNIT which was the first time we had made any post  season appearances, and our guys were tired and we had an individual  work out day, and they didn   t really wanna do it. I remember Stacey  Dales saying,    We   re tired and we   re sore and we need a break.    The  conversation we had with the team that about, pushing through that  obstacle, and making your way through that thing that   s keeping you  12  Nykolaiszyn  Coale  from what you want to be. And those kids   that group of kids always  looks back to that.  The biggest hurdle at both positions, Norman High school and the  University of Oklahoma, was changing perception. That was by far the  most difficult thing we had to do, internally and externally. The only  way I know to do that is continuous acts of sincerity, just doing what  you say you   re going to do over and over and over again. Then  eventually people buy in. I think when you do it that way   it   s difficult  if there   s been a very poor perception. It   s difficult to turn it, but then  when you do turn it, the loyalty of the group of people who support you  is so deep and so strong that it   s unwavering. And I think that   s one of  the reasons people say,    You know you guys play Arkansas Pine Bluff,  and you have nine-thousand people at the game, why is that?    Because  it   s not about who we play, it   s about the product that we put on the  floor.  Your student athletes, they   re involved in the community, they have high  GPA   s in the classroom, and they do well on the court. How are you  able to balance   have them balance all of these things going on?  It   s difficult, especially difficult right now. We   re doing this interview  end of August, first of September. The most difficult period of time for  our student athletes is the first five weeks of school. The NCAA does  not allow us to practice, and only in groups of four, the current rule   no  more than four. It changes every year, so I have to throw that in there,  the current rule, who knows what it will be next year. But they have  lifting in the morning and they go to class, then they come back and they  have individual workouts, and then they have team conditioning, and  then they go to tutor appointments, and then they have some night  classes, and then   oh by the way, we want you to go deliver Meals on  Wheels for the weekend, and then we have a Special Olympics event  coming in here on Wednesday morning, and so their calendars are just  absolutely full. It   s a great lesson to learn, because they have to figure  out, in order to be successful here, you have to figure out that your  personal wants and needs and desires might have to move down the  ladder just a little bit, in order to fulfill what you need to do for all the  people who are counting on you.  It really teaches kids immediately to think outside of themselves, to be  about a purpose greater than them. That   s a hard lesson for young people  to learn sometimes, but a very valuable one. So at the end, hopefully  kids graduate from here and they want to go be involved in Meals on  Wheels in Lubbock, Texas, or wherever they go from this point. But if  not, at least they   ve impacted Norman and Oklahoma while they   ve been  here in school for four years. What we find out is increasingly, kids are  13  Nykolaiszyn  Coale  involved in their community because of the experience they had while  they were here.  And you   re also pretty involved in the basketball world. Recently you  just started a two-year term as President of the Women   s Basketball  Coaches Association. Is that a big deal?  Yeah, it   s a big deal in terms of workload. I don   t know if it   s a big deal  in any other frame. I said one time jokingly,    I   m not sure what I did to  get the position, behaved badly perhaps, I   m not sure.    Because it really  is   it   s another job, but it   s an important one. I began to pay attention  three or four years ago really to who was making decisions and why  decisions were being made. When Marsha Sharp was president of the  organization   she was in our conference, and she would come to our  conference meetings, and would talk about,    Guys you have got to fill  out this survey, or you got to talk to your president about this or you   ve  got to talk to your athletic director   ,    this is the first I ever thought  about that I played any role whatsoever. You know, it   s like having the  right to vote and not exercising the privilege. It had never dawned on me  that I needed to be involved on the national level, not so much I needed  to say grace over right here, get somebody else to do it   that kind of  thing. Well when Marsha did it, she really brought home the why and  how of it to those of us in this conference.  When Marsha finished her tenure as the WBCA president, she really  encouraged me to take a position on the board. She said,    They   re going  to come ask you about it and would you be involved in the board?    And  I   m not going to tell Marsha,    No.    She was such a great mentor and  friend, and remains that to me. She could ask me just about anything and  I   d probably do it. So, I took a position on the board. Then, when Beth  Bass the current CEO came and asked me about running for president, I  didn   t want to do it. I said,    Beth, get somebody without children, I have  two little kids and my schedule is packed and I just don   t think I can take  anything else on.     I was finishing the USA Basketball commitment, there's a bit of overlap  there   I   m still involved with USA Basketball but only one more year.  Eventually it came down to the best way for evil to prevail was for good  people to do nothing. I   ve been taught that since I was a little bitty kid,  and so you   we sit in this position, not that the whole basketball world  was evil, and I   ve got to solve it   I don   t mean that at all. It   s just that  sometimes we sit in this position, all of us behind our desks and say,     Somebody needs to do something about this,    and we   re all too busy,  or too tired, or too otherwise engaged to do it. I thought it was important  to be involved and to follow the example that Marsha and others had set.  So, I agreed to do it and I have enjoyed it so far. I   ve learned so much     14  Nykolaiszyn  Coale  Nykolaiszyn  Coale  Nykolaiszyn  Coale  I   ve learned so much and I   ve met some really neat people through the  process, too. While it is a lot of work I think it also will be a lot of fun  and will be very rewarding.  Can you go into a key moment in your career that you consider one of  your biggest highlights?  Wow. That one may take some thought. They come in all forms. This  summer, I was at a recruiting event in Augusta, Georgia, doing what we  all do   going to the Nike tournament and watching the next great  players play. I called Caton Hill, who   s a former player of mine. She  was on the 2002 national runner up team and is in medical school. She  was doing her pre-residency there at the military hospital. Phylesha  Whaley who was my very first signee here is now a nurse in the Army.  She is stationed in Augusta, Georgia. We got Caton and Phylesha  together at the hotel and had dinner. You know, Phylesha   s in her full  uniform. She   s a military nurse and talking about when she goes to Iraq,  it will be upcoming probably within the next year. And Caton, in her  medical business, she   d been making rounds that morning, and just to  see those two guys and to know how accomplished they are as a result of  their education and experience here, and to hear them talk about what it  means.  Just this week one of my former players got her stockbrokers license and  passed a test that only 18  of the people in the country pass. Stacey  Dales, and what she   s doing on ESPN   the most defining moments  come after they stop playing, when they go out into the world and they  become these really, really neat people, and make such a difference  where they are. That   s the best part, that   s the most defining part.  When you were notified that you were going to be inducted into the  Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame, tell me what was going through your  mind at the time.  I   m not possibly old enough. (Laughter) It   s one of those things where, I  think about the female pioneers in the state and there are women who are  legendary. I think of Christy Gaylord Everest and Mary Jane Noble, and  people who I have followed from afar for years and years and years and  the impact that they   ve had on literally millions of people is astounding.  And so to be mentioned in their company is, kind of a thing that   s a  stretch for me.  Do you remember who presented you at the ceremony?  I did not go to the ceremony, I had a game   a competition and so Kim  Henry accepted on behalf of me.  15  Nykolaiszyn  Coale  Nykolaiszyn  Coale  Nykolaiszyn  Coale  How do you feel that now, you have these players who are out doing  great things, and even young girls looking to become coaches in the  future, how do you feel that now, they look at you as a role-model?  Well, I think that I have a close relationship, and would consider myself  a close friend with the majority of my former players. And the fact that  they come by, and they come back, and we exchange Christmas cards,  and they let me know where they are   that piece of it   that   s the best  part of this job. Occasionally, you get the letter of the kid who is a high  school coach, or a high school teacher and a coach, because of the way  you mentored them, and they want to do that for other students.  I keep a letter up there from Tina Taylor. She was a senior that I  inherited here at the University of Oklahoma. She was the only senior  when I took over the program in    96 that stayed and she went on to be a  high school teacher and is a head high school coach now. She sent me a  beautiful letter that I keep   I   m not ever going to put it in a drawer. It   s  right up there on the bulletin board   just of thanks for the mentorship  that I provided, and that she hoped she could do that for another.  How important is it for you to be able to coach in your home-state of  Oklahoma?  Oh, I think it adds. I mean this is an incredible profession and to be able  to coach at a university of this magnitude is a special thing, but to be  born and raised in this state   I was growing up in a household where, all  the OU football games were not on TV, but they were on the radio. So  you just   whatever you doing, the rough-housing and the playing and  the screaming, you stopped on Saturday afternoon    cause the game was  on. I mean you knew it, and that   s just what we did. The radio was on in  every room in the house so in case you walked from room to room, you  didn   t miss a play, so it was a big deal. I stood in line for Tinker Owens     autograph. I always tell Steve,    It wasn   t your autograph I wanted, it was  your brother   s.    I was all about Tinker. But just like every little fan  growing up in Oklahoma, waiting for them to come out of the tunnel  after games, and get autographs. This was the state   s institution, I mean  this was the best place you could go, and so to ultimately work here is     it   s just sometimes incomprehensible to me.  What would be your advice to women who plan to follow in your  footsteps?  I could probably write a book on that, but probably the boldest piece of  advice would be don   t lose who you are. I think, sometimes, women get  into a profession that is typically male-dominated, and they feel like they  have to be a guy to do that   you don   t. Don   t trade those in, or leave  16  Nykolaiszyn  Coale  Nykolaiszyn  Coale  Nykolaiszyn  Coale  Nykolaiszyn  Coale  those at the door when you walk in, because those things help you do  your job in a very unique way. And when you do move into that  profession, you don   t have to do it like the person to your right or to  your left or the one that came before. You have to put your own stamp  on it. Whatever you do, do it in your way.  When history is written about you, what would you like for it to say?  That I made a difference. That I enjoyed what I did on a daily basis and  let people see my passion for people, for basketball, and most  importantly for life. And that I made them think about what their passion  is. That I made a difference.  And if you could tell your fellow Oklahomans anything, what would you  tell them?  Thank you for making this such an extraordinary place to live. Honestly,  I grew up here and thought this is how it was, and I began to recruit and  visit different states, and different types of people, and began to figure  out that this place is extraordinary, and the more we bring outside people  in and expose them to our way, for lack of a better term, they   re drawn  into it too. Very rarely do I ever bring somebody here that   s never been  to Oklahoma before, that they don   t leave and go,    Wow, what a unique  place.    So thank you for being real and for making this a place where  people feel special.  Who do you credit your success to?  There are so many people who   ve been influential, who I would not be  where I am today without. It begins with my family, obviously my mom  and my dad, and my granny and my papa, who is diseased. My brother,  who lives in Edmond and is my biggest fan. It goes right through my  high school coach, and into college where Dan Hayes and Stephanie  Finley helped teach me the game of basketball, where Dr. Darryl Tippins  taught me how to teach Shakespeare, where Lynn McMillan taught me  how to make the scripture real in my daily life. Right into the people that  I work with now here at the University of Oklahoma. I   ve just been very,  very blessed.  Outside of having another successful season, what do you see yourself  doing in the future? Do you think you   ll continue coaching? Do you  think you   ll just retire somewhere and hide away? Or write a book?  Oh gosh, there are lots of things I want to do, lots of things I want to do.  Writing a book is one of them, that   s a project that takes an inordinate  amount of time, and I don   t know that I   ll ever be able to squeeze it in  17  Nykolaiszyn  Coale  Nykolaiszyn  Coale  Nykolaiszyn  while I   m doing this job, but that   s something I want to do one day. I  love to work in my garden, love flowers and trees and landscaping and  would love to be involved with that in some way. But I really love to  write, that   s one of my passions. At some point, I want to hole-away in a  cottage on the beach and write a book.  Well is there anything else you   d like to add today?  Gosh, I don   t think so. I   ll give you my blood type if you want.  (Laughter)  Well, we appreciate you taking time out of your schedule to meet with  us.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  -------  -------
