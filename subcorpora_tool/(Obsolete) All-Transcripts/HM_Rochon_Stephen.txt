Speaker 2: Yes, I do.  My favorite food, honestly, is shrimp po-boy.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, what is that?  I have, you know, is it a sandwich?

Speaker 2: It's so good.
Speaker 1: All right, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: It used to be green, the color of money.  But, you know, I, my zodiac sign is Pisces, the fish in the ocean, so, and being attracted to, you know, the [U.S.] Coast Guard, blue.  My favorite color is blue.

Speaker 1: All right, and the last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I do have a favorite phrase that I borrowed from my mentor, Alex Haley, the author of the book 'Roots', and on his tombstone and on my coins, it says, "Find the good and praise it."
Story_ID: 626518
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask you about your family history.  I'm gonna ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but we'll keep 'em separate, and then we'll put 'em together.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Ursula, U-R-S-U-L-A, Bernice, B-E-R-N-I-C-E, maiden, Carrere, C-A-R-R-E-R-E, and current last name Jupiter, J-U-P-I-T-E-R.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She was a Rochon.
Speaker 1: All right, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Date of birth is March 2, 1924, New Orleans, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what can you--how far back can you trace your mother's side of the family?
Speaker 2: My mother's side goes back--we did a much better job on my father's family.  But my mother's family, we can trace back to Canada, somewhere around the mid-1700s.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what's the story?  What were they doing in Canada?
Speaker 2: We don't know the date of my mother's side, but they originated in Northern France, and then came over to Canada and then migrated from Canada to, I believe it was St. James Parish, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay, and when did the family migrate to St. James Parish?
Speaker 2: It would have been in the early 1700s.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: And that's on my mother's father's side.  My mother's mother's side, I believe, came through Martinique.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then great grandmother came from Tampico, Mexico.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, and I'm guessing now, but is the side from Canada, like, you know, straight up French side, no African American?
Speaker 2: No, the first indication of, my great, great, great grandfather, Theodile Picou was a free man of color.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he has some African heritage--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --as well as French heritage, so?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he's a man of color.  And he was, I know at one time there was slavery in Canada when, and some of the U.S. territories, there was no slavery.  And then vise-versa, you know, sort of like flipped back and forth a couple of times.
Speaker 2: And that's probably why he was a free man of color 'cause they, I think they ended slavery earlier in Canada.
Speaker 1: Right, I think about 1830, it was over with.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But I think it's, it varies even between, you know, from one part to the next, one province to--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: But, okay, so he came--his name is Theodor--
Speaker 2: Theodile, T-H-E-O-D-I-L-E, Picou, P-I-C-O-U.
Story_ID: 626519
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and so he [Theodile Picou; Rochon's ancestor] migrates down to Louisiana, and on your maternal side of your mother's family, they're from Martinique?
Speaker 2: My grandmother was from--well, naturally, I have grandmothers.  One was from Martinique, and I can't remember the full name there.  And one was from Tampico, Mexico.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Josephine Sublay (ph.).  Now, Sublay is a French name, but her father as a French soldier who lost the battle in Mexico.  But he stayed and married a Mexican lady.
Speaker 1: Now, this is back in the 1800s.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were--
Speaker 1: Napoleon was trying to take Mexico at one point.
Speaker 2: That's exactly right.  And the soldiers, because they lost, were afraid to go back to France because Napoleon probably wouldn't have been too happy with them.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) move [unmic'd].
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: I see.  So this is a, okay, this is an unusual kind of grouping of people.
Speaker 2: They're actually also hidden in there somewhere is a Native American.  And I'd have to look at some notes, Henriette, and I believe that was on my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, where did your--is there a place where the family basically settled in, well, they settled in New Orleans [Louisiana] itself?  Or did they--
Speaker 2: On my mother's [Ursula Bernice Carrere] side, we're referring to--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --was in St. James Parish [Louisiana]--
Speaker 1: Okay, that's right--
Speaker 2: --which is outside of New Orleans--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --and then later came to the city.
Speaker 1: So what are the stories about your family on that side, the historical stories?  What were they doing, and--
Speaker 2: If I recall, the original Theodile Picou was a fur trapper in Canada before he came down to Louisiana.  And then he owned a plantation.  What I don't know yet--we have not been able to track down if whether or not on that plantation, being a free man of color, did he own slaves himself.
Speaker 1: That's a possibility in those days.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my grandfather on my mother's side was a Buffalo soldier back in 1898.
Speaker 1: What is his name?
Speaker 2: His name is Albert DeSalle, D-E-S-A-L-L-E.  And he fought with Teddy [Theodore] Roosevelt in Cuba.
Speaker 1: Okay, during the Spanish-American War.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there a military, is there lineage on your mother's side?  Is he the only one or are there other people who served in various branches?
Speaker 2: There are others.  My, her father, my grandfather, served in World War I in the [U.S.] Army.  He had another, one of her brothers, my uncle served in World War II in the Army.  And another one of her brothers served in the [U.S.] Air Force in the Korean War.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so did your mother's parents, like move into, move to New Orleans at a certain point from St. James Parish or did the city kind of--
Speaker 2: Well, before them--
Speaker 1: --expand out to--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --before my mother's parents, they were in St. James Parish, but my grandfather, Emile Carrere and his wife, Hildred DeSalle Carrere, were in New Orleans.  My grandfather was born in New Orleans.  I have not been able to track down where my grand, my grandmother on my mother's side was born.
Story_ID: 626520
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now what did they [Rochon's maternal grandparents, Emile Carrere and Hildred DeSalle Carrere] do for a living in New Orleans [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: My grandfather was a, one of the original Pullmans, he was a Pullman porter.  As you know, the folks that took care of the cabins or sleeping cars on the trains were, they were known as Georges, named after George Pullman.  So and back then, they really didn't have an identity.  So it was sort of, I think, derogatory in a sense, these days, but everyone of 'em were called "George," after George Pullman that created the Pullman cars.  But he proudly served.  I think he was a Pullman for, I believe, forty-two years.
Speaker 1: Now, this is a job that is, requires a lot of travel.  And it's tougher than people think because of the sleep deprivation.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Sleep deprivation.  I think he traveled, the way he used to say, to every state but the two Dakotas.  So he covered basically the whole country.  But the other thing I think that was difficult about that job during that period was, you know, he wasn't treated, you know, the best.  Some people did, you know.  Some people appreciated, and I can recall picking him up with my mother [Ursula Bernice Carrere] from the train station and getting these hefty tips in his hands.  One guy even gave him a gold watch.  But then there were others that did not treat him so well.
Speaker 1: Okay, so every trip was a new adventure in a lot of ways?
Speaker 2: Right.  I think that was, during that time was the birth of the [Brotherhood of the] Sleeping Car Porters, a union that he was very involved in.
Speaker 1: Okay, so was he one of the original members of the--
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yes, he was.
Speaker 1: All right.  Did he know A. Philip Randolph?
Speaker 2: You know, I'd have to ask my brothers.  They tend to be a little bit closer on that.  But I recall that being mentioned, that he actually met him.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Did your grandmother work?
Speaker 2: She, unfortunately, died at childbirth at thirty-one years old.  So I didn't get a chance to meet her, and she left six children for my grandfather to take care of.  So she was definitely, you know, a stay-at-home mom.  But she died at an early age, when my mom was only six [years old].
Story_ID: 626521
Speaker 1: What did your mother [Ursula Bernice Carrere] say about growing up?  Or what did you get, I mean from your mother about growing up in New Orleans [Louisiana] in those days?
Speaker 2: From what I understand, you know, my father--my grandfather [Emile Carrere] was just very loving, giving man.  And, but six children for a man in those days and being on the train [as a Pullman porter] was difficult.  And so she recalls them being split up and going to different relatives.  In fact, she and her younger sister, my aunt, were sent to the convent up here in Baltimore [Maryland], which is an all-African American Order of Nuns.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the--
Speaker 2: Oblate.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The Oblate Sisters of Providence.
Speaker 1: Sisters of Providence.
Speaker 2: And it worked out well because my great aunt, his sister, was a nun.  And she, I think died at ninety-four years old.  So they went to boarding school up here in Baltimore.
Speaker 1: What was your aunt, who was the nun's name?
Speaker 2: Well, her religious name was Sister Eucharia, E-U-C-H-A-R-I-A, Sister Eucharia Carrere, C-A-R-R-E-R-E.  But her given name was Camille.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Okay, so your mother was raised in, at the--
Speaker 2: Pretty much at the convent.
Speaker 1: --at the convent, right.
Speaker 2: Mainly for school periods, I think.  In the summer, she came home with my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Now, we've been to the space they currently occupy about three years ago, but have they, was that the space back then--
Speaker 2: Yes, on Gunn Road in Catonsville.  They're still there, sort of a, the vocations are not there.  So the nuns are getting older, and no one's coming into the nunnery, so to speak, the convent.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so this is a very different life than a lot of little girls raised up during the [Great] Depression.  She's in this convent.  Did she have any stories about being raised there or--
Speaker 2: I think she recalls some very fond memories.  It escapes me the name of the school in Baltimore that still exists.  It may be Sacred Heart, but I'm not sure.  But she did have some fond memories.  In fact, even to this day, she, you know, she goes back to long-term memory, with the Alzheimer's.  And that seems to be very fresh, fond memory on her mind.  She'll talk as if my great aunt is still alive.  But then she'll talk about how, you know, the, she took her in, and they had a great life because her daddy couldn't, you know, raise all six children by himself.
Speaker 1: Right, and the nature of his work, he was out of town.
Speaker 2: Out of town, trying to pay for their room and board.
Speaker 1: So your mother went to school at the convent too, I guess, or on their school?
Speaker 2: In their school, yes.
Speaker 1: Right, in the City of Baltimore?
Speaker 2: No, after--well, in the City of Baltimore, yes, and then after leaving that school, then she came back to New Orleans [Louisiana] to attend high school.  So that was grade school in Baltimore.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, who did she stay with back in New Orleans when she went back?
Speaker 2: Well, by that time, you know, they were teenagers and were able to do pretty well on their own.  My grandfather remarried, and so they were back with him again.  And she went through high school, and then I believe shortly after high school, married my father [Gilbert Leonard Rochon].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 626522
Speaker 1: Let me go to your father's side of the family now, and then we'll put 'em together.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Gilbert, G-I-L-B-E-R-T, Leonard, L-E-O-N-A-R-D, Rochon, Jr.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: That was a little, I probably have that in some notes, but I believe it was September, 1925 in Lake Charles, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, tell us about your father's side of the family?  How far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: 1601 in Northern France.  And at that time, the family's name was Rocheron, R-O-C-H-E-R-O-N.  And from what I understand, King Louie XIV sent the three Rocheron brothers to colonize Canada.  And after they were in Canada for a while, the name was shortened to Rochon.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was somewhere around 1930, maybe 1970--I'm sorry, not 19--1673, that they decided to move South.  And it was Charles Rochon who first went to Louisiana, and then shortly after that, went to Mobile, Alabama.  And, in fact, I believe he was responsible for colonizing or building up Mobile.  There may even be a plaque with his name somewhere in Mobile.  And then the family--he died in Mobile.  But the family went back to Louisiana, St. Martinville, Louisiana is where my grandfather on my father's side was born.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then from St. Martinville to Lake Charles is where my father was born, and then my father moved to New Orleans [Louisiana] and met my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did your father grow up in Lake Charles?
Speaker 2: Yes, he did.
Speaker 1: Okay, did he have any stories of growing up in Lake Charles?
Speaker 2: My father left when I was three years old, so we didn't get much of the, you know, the memories, other than they had a pretty nice household.  My grandfather married a second time.  So Isabelle Campbell was my grandmother.  She was my father's mother.  And there's some background on that side of the family, the Campbell family.  But she had my father, Gilbert, his sister, Madeline, and his sister, Denise.  And, of course, there were other siblings from the first family.  But I understand they had a very nice life.  My grandfather was a master carpenter, and so he was able to take great care of his family.
Story_ID: 626523
Speaker 1: All right, so he [Rochon's father, Gilbert Leonard Rochon] leaves your life when you're three years old?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And did, so he never really interacted with you after that or--
Speaker 2: Some time after that, we became very close as an adult before he died, extremely close.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He enjoyed my military life, and he showed up at, you know, a lot of events 'cause he lived in California, but he would fly to Cleveland [Ohio] or he'd fly to New Orleans [Louisiana], and he'd fly somewhere just to be involved in my career.  My mother [Ursula Bernice Carrere] never--it was a sore thing for her, but she never talked to us about hating him or whatever.  It was just the opposite.  He's not here, but, you know, love your dad.  So, but I do remember stories of them meeting.  They went to Xavier Prep High School, which is the same school I went to.  And then he went on to pharmacy school at Xavier University and became a pharmacist.  And it was shortly after that the family moved to St. Louis, Missouri, my mother, my father and the three sons.  And my youngest--actually, it was my mother and father and two sons 'cause my youngest brother was actually born in St. Louis.  My father then became a very successful businessman, and owned a couple of drugstores.  And when he moved back to--I think they split in St. Louis.  So when we came back to live with my grandfather [Emile Carrere] in New Orleans, I was three years old.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they had enough of a difference where they split.  So your mother brought you all back to New Orleans and--
Speaker 2: And my father, my grandfather took us in.  He bought a house uptown, a very comfortable house.  It was just wonderful, wonderful memories.  He was the, he was really the father figure in my life.
Speaker 1: Okay, and this is your grandfather--which one is it, the--
Speaker 2: Grandfather on my mother's side, Emile Carrere.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we stayed in regular contact with my father's father.  Some of those fond memories were making trips to Lake Charles, Louisiana every summer, every summer and spending time with grandpa and my grandmother.  So although he wasn't in our lives, our young lives, they were.
Story_ID: 626524
Speaker 1: Okay, so then, so your mother [Ursula Bernice Carrere] and father [Gilbert Leonard Rochon] split up.  Now, and you say your grandfather [Emile Carrere], your maternal grandfather, is basically the father figure when you're growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so, did you live at your grandfather's place [in New Orleans, Louisiana] the whole time, I mean, you know, when you were--
Speaker 2: All the way to the time I went in the [U.S.] Coast Guard--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at twenty years old.
Speaker 1: All right, so when you think about your parents, and even your grandfather, at this juncture, and, you know, their talents and dispositions and how they approach things, what they look like even, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I can answer that pretty quickly, my mother.  Every night when I tuck her in and put in her eye drops before turning out the lights, she says, you remind me more of Daddy Emile than any, anybody.  You act like him, and you look just like him (laughter).  So I favor my grandfather a lot, but my wife says I'm a spitting image of my mother.  My oldest brother really is the spitting image of my father, tall, fair complected, red freckles.  He looks just like my dad.  And my youngest brother favors more of my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, your older brother, now, he's the president of Tuskegee [University] as we speak?
Speaker 2: He's the president of Tuskegee University, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what's his name again?
Speaker 2: Gilbert Leonard Rochon III.  My father was a junior 'cause he didn't know it was gonna be a Gilbert after him, so (laughter).  So he's not the second, but Gilbert is the third.
Speaker 1: And your younger brother?
Speaker 2: Gregory Paul Rochon.  Gregory is supervisor at Amtrak here in [Washington] D.C. [District of Columbia]. He moved from New Orleans because of [Hurricane] Katrina [2005].  And Amtrak provided him an opportunity here.
Speaker 1: Okay, you have any other siblings?
Speaker 2: I have a half brother and half sister from my father's third family in California.  Unfortunately, my little half brother and half sister from his second marriage are deceased, various illnesses, diabetes and whatever.  But they died in their thirties.  And my mother remarried many, many years later to Ulysses Jupiter.  So I have nine step brothers and sisters.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I saw that name on the outline, Ulysses Jupiter, and I was thinking, I said, what is--there's gotta be a story behind this--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --name.
Speaker 2: I don't know where the Jupiter family came from.  I have to ask my step brothers and sisters.  I'm certain they've done a little search.  But it's a, they were not--well, he wasn't born in New Orleans.  He was born on the outskirts of the river in Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know it was a tradition way back in the slavery days of naming slaves of particular household people after Greek deities and other biblical figures, you know.
Speaker 2: Interesting.  I have to ask them if they've done, you know, their genealogy.  That's, I mean that's likely that could have happened that way.
Speaker 1: A lot of Princes and Jupiters, and there's a famous Jupiter Hammond who was a black leader in the early part of the nineteenth century, yeah.  So, that's just, you know, I was wondering--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know--(unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Nah, it's very interesting.
Speaker 1: --and that was a given name that became the last name, you know--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --going forward.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous) [unmic'd] after the slavery of people's first name, they'd taken their family name after the--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: So, it's interesting.  Ulysses Jupiter.
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Story_ID: 626525
Speaker 1: Okay, so do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I have so many, Larry [Crowe; interviewer with The HistoryMakers].  We had a wonderful, loving home.  My mother [Ursula Bernice Carrere] has the capacity that is huge for--not just caring for her own family, but she's even to this day, at eighty-nine years old, she thinks she can still do everything for everybody else.  But, you know, the thing that I can think of that was really quite fond memories, there's just so many.  But if I can just pick one out is, my mother liked to take trips with us in a car.  And she had her old paneled-side station wagon that she would load her three sons in.  And we would take trips, either to Bay St. Louis, Mississippi to go crabbing and swimming.  Another one that was actually a lot of fun was, my mother used to go around the city in New Orleans [Louisiana] from relatives and friends and collect decent or new clothing, shoes, school books and non-perishable foods.  And then we would pile into her station wagon and drive to Church Pointe, Louisiana to the cotton fields.  And she would have her station wagon loaded with all these clothing and food for the less fortunate kids in Church Pointe.  And it would always be one of the convents that we would take it to.  So, you know, it gave us an early sense of giving.  It was a good feeling and really great memories.  But one of those trips, I recall was probably the most memorable, was to Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia], here in the D.C. area.  I believe I was eight years old, and she put us in the car and drove us through various towns on the way to D.C.  One town stood out.  And that was Memphis [Tennessee].  Mom was really tired.  We were cranky, and she needed, she wanted to find a hotel.  And we stopped at a gas station and the gentleman very rudely--in fact, I was ten, very rudely said, you can't find any hotels for you people on this side of the track.  So you're gonna have to go on the other side.  And stayed in a hotel, which was a lot of fun actually.  We couldn't afford to order food to the room.  So we got excited by ordering a glass of water.  That hotel was called the Lorraine Hotel.  Eight years later, that's where Dr. [Martin Luther] King was assassinated.  And so we went further, went to St. Louis [Missouri], visited friends and family there 'cause we used to live there--not that I recall, but we were there.  But then we ended up in D.C., and that was a whole new world, the Washington Monument, Air and Space Museum, Smithsonian, Lincoln Memorial, and our last trip--that was ten, ten years old, I remember the White House and going through those rooms and little did I know that all these years later that I would be running that House.  But--
Speaker 1: So that was in--you were there in the Kennedy [President John F. Kennedy] years, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: John Kennedy was just--had he taken office?
Speaker 2: Let's see, he was in '62 [1962], he was running.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was running, and he didn't take office till '61 [1961], the beginning of '61 [1961].
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: That would have been the [President Dwight] Eisenhower White House that you were in?
Speaker 2: It probably was, yes.  And isn't that interesting that the butler at the time is the one that they're writing about now because he started with Eisenhower.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's Eugene Allen.
Speaker 2: Eugene Allen.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, the other part of that trip was, the fun part is mom is probably, my mother was the best cook in New Orleans, by far, not just from her kids, but everyone said she could take a baloney sandwich and make it taste like filet mignon.  And so she would pile up fried chicken and potato salad and bread and drinks and so it was a pleasurable long trip to D.C. and back.  That was some of my fondest memories.
Story_ID: 626526
Speaker 1: Okay, that's quite a, this is a big milestone, you know, for the family to make that long trip--
Speaker 2: Alone, a woman alone.
Speaker 1: Through the South, you know, in those days.
Speaker 2: And particularly, when we did stop to take little freshen-up breaks, you know, we clearly remember the "Colored" water fountains, and the "White-Only" water fountain in Woolworths [store].  And we do, I can, I can remember driving up to a gas station, and there was a sign on the door.  And mom wanted to stop and get some drinks for us.  And it says, "No dogs, no niggers."  It was like yesterday and just drove off to the next place.
Speaker 1: Now, this is something that, now, you didn't experience this kind of thing in New Orleans [Louisiana], I take it?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Did you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that--you know, my mother [Ursula Bernice Carrere] tried her best to shield us and to protect us.  We went to, you know, fine schools, private schools.  How she did it, I don't know, off of a miniscule salary from Xavier University as a chemistry lab supervisor, stockroom supervisor.  But she did.  She tried her best to protect us, but when you're walking to a Boy Scout meeting on Magazine Street, and this red '57 [1957] Chev drives down with a car full of white gentlemen, and they're yelling everything out of the window and throwing cokes bottles at your head, you were reminded that racism was clearly alive.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) remind you, coke bottles at your head?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah.  You had to duck and be really good.  I remember getting on the public bus, public transportation, riding from Audubon Park, actually from home to Audubon Park to the school.  And this was both grammar school and high school.  And the buses were segregated, so you had to sit behind a sign, a movable sign that said, wooden sign, it said, "For colored patrons only."  And you had to sit behind that sign.  And if a white person got on the bus, they can take that sign and move it behind you, and you had to get up and give up your seat and sit behind that sign.  So, yes, I did.  It wasn't just Memphis, Tennessee.  It was clearly New Orleans.
Speaker 1: On that trip to Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia], did, was Washington, D.C. segregated similarly with signs and--
Speaker 2: We didn't, I--we didn't see it at all.  You know, and when I talk to my wife these days, she's from up here.  I married a Yankee, and she, she says she did not grow up in what she recalls blatant segregation or racism.  Washington, D.C., I think was a bit different.  People moved from the South and North Carolina, coming across the 14th Street Bridge during Dr. [Martin Luther] King's time to escape that sort of thing.  And D.C. was sort of like a haven.  So she didn't grow up in the same environment that I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So there was a breaking down--I mean in D.C., at one point, there were remnants of that.  One president actually had signs in the White House like that.  But I can't--
Speaker 2: I'm certain it was.
Speaker 1: By [President Dwight] Eisenhower's time, well, certainly [President Harry S.] Truman and Eisenhower didn't have that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It was probably, you know, further back, but--
Speaker 2: We just didn't see it on that trip.  And she said that she may have not seen it because--now, she was raised in a family of ten children.  One was her, the only son, her brother was killed in Vietnam.  But they were raised in Southern Maryland, and the grandfather had them on a tobacco farm.  And so they were kind of shielded from maybe some of that was going on in D.C.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think you're right, so that Washington, D.C., itself, by the time your wife was being raised, it was probably not that blatant--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --with the signs, but--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --surrounded by Virginia and Maryland--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, cross that line.  Oh, yeah.
Story_ID: 626527
Speaker 1: So, now, where did you start school?
Speaker 2: My grade school was at Blessed Sacrament School in New Orleans [Louisiana].  It was run by the Blessed Sacrament nuns, founded by St. Katharine Drexel, who dedicated her wealth and time to raising African American and Native American children across the country.
Speaker 1: Now, she's a white woman who inherited a lot of money from what I understand?
Speaker 2: From the famous Drexel family in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], yep.
Speaker 1: And, they have a univer--Drexel University [Philadelphia] is named after that family, named for that family.
Speaker 2: I, maybe in Pennsylvania.  New Orleans, which I also attended, was Xavier Prep [High School] and then Xavier University.  And it's interesting you mention that because now Xavier Prep that I went through high school for four years, the nuns can no longer support it.  So the alumni has rescued it, and now it's called St. Katharine Drexel Prep because the nuns can't keep it any longer.  As I mentioned, you know, the priests and nuns are not getting the vocations.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I went to Blessed Sacrament for eight years.
Story_ID: 626528
Speaker 1: Okay, now, let's just pause on that for a minute.  When you were in grade school, did you have a--did you know what you wanted to be when you grew up?  Did you have a, like I'm gonna grow up to be an admiral, or did you--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I definitely didn't say I was gonna grow up to be admiral.  I don't know if I knew what an admiral was back then.
Speaker 1: I'm kind of kidding you, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but--
Speaker 1: What were your thoughts then?
Speaker 2: In grade school, I was a little, going back and forth.  At one point, I, from a distance, from afar, I admired my father's [Gilbert Leonard Rochon] business acumen.  So, and being a pharmacist.  And I says, I wanna be like dad.  And I didn't, never lived with him.  And I think my grandfather [Emile Carrere] says, you know, Ursula, your crazy kids.  I don't know why they love this man (laughter), and we didn't even know him.  But that's the way she [Rochon's mother, Ursula Bernice Carrere] was.  She wanted us to not hate, but love.
Speaker 1: She provided this positive image of your father--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and was your father, did he come down and visit periodically, or did he--
Speaker 2: Not while we were growing up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Did you know if he sent money to--
Speaker 2: I know he didn't.  There may have been occasions, but mom carried the load completely.  But I wanted, I says, wow, you know, I think I wanna be a pharmacist.  And then I knew he owned a number of drugstores in California.  So I says, I wanna be a businessman.  And then I had this weird idea toward the end of my grade school that I had, I wanted to become a priest, believe it or not.  And my mother said, I don't know if you have the vocation.  She says, you're being influenced by too many religious in the family.  Your oldest brother is in the seminary, which he was, Gilbert [Rochon III].  And he spent, I think like eight years in the seminary.  Your cousin, Olivier from Lake Charles [Louisiana] is a priest, and now he's a retired bishop.  Your great aunt [Sister Eucharia Carrere] is a nun, and you have all of these nuns and priests that are close friends of the family.  She says, try one year at the prep [Xavier Prep High School], and if you wanna go to the seminary after that year, I'll let you go.  Ma was right.  I didn't have the vocation.  I don't know whether it was the skirts or (laughter) what it was, but I dropped the whole idea of wanting to be a priest.  But I didn't drop the idea of wanting to be a pharmacist.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I went to Xavier University--
Speaker 1: Now, I don't wanna get you that far yet, but--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --but growing up, like what were you--what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up when you were like a kid, you know, in grade school?
Speaker 2: Before I say that, there was one other profession that I considered in grade school.  And I was influenced by my grandfather in Lake Charles, although I don't believe--he may have served, but I thought about the military, as you mentioned admiral and whatever.  I didn't know ranks, but I certainly considered, I said, I think I wanna be in the military because when I went to Lake Charles [Louisiana] one summer to visit him, he made a wooden rifle since he was a carpenter.  And I can recall, not that anyone told me this, but I can recall at that young age in grammar school, I think early grammar school, he had this huge backyard in Lake Charles, Louisiana, and I would take that wooden rifle and they said, constantly, I would march up and down that yard, saying, "Hup 2, 3, 4, hup," and so I wanted to be in the military back then.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It changed later, but we'll talk about that.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Story_ID: 626529
Speaker 1: So as far as smells, sights--
Speaker 2: Sights, sounds and smells, right.
Speaker 1: Sights, sounds and smells.  Sights, clearly remember fondly the French Quarters, St. Louis Cathedral, (unclear) Mall Restaurant, Bourbon Street [New Orleans, Louisiana] as a kid.  You used to be able to drive down Bourbon Street at night.  Mom [Ursula Bernice Carrere] just wanted us to, I guess either see the sights or see the crazies in the centers.  And so we'd drive Bourbon Street, and we thought that was pretty wild and pretty interesting.  And Audubon Park and the zoo, and the 200-year old live oak trees.  All those were fine, really fond memories of sights growing up.  Smells, I think that dominated everything.  You think being raised in a city that's known for its cuisine and a mother that just cooked some unbelievable meals daily.  I remember jambalaya.  I remember smelling shrimp creole and crawfish etouffee and shrimp po-boys and Camellia trees, the wonderful scent of that red flower.  Sounds, St. Charles streetcar bell, whenever it came to the cross street.  And I think most, a lot of people do relate New Orleans with that, you know, ding, ding, ding sound, almost like a San Francisco [California] trolley car-type.  So I remember the sounds.  I remember I used to go on the ferryboat ride often, across the Mississippi River.  And so clearly, I remember the whistle being sounded when they leave the dock.  Fond sounds like that, yeah, probably a few more out there.
Story_ID: 626530
Speaker 1: Now, where did your family live in New Orleans [Louisiana]?  Did you live in the Ninth Ward or did you live--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: We lived in Uptown--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Carrollton Avenue area, right at the river bend, where St. Charles Avenue becomes Carrollton Avenue at the river, the bend of the river.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what about the music and Mardi Gras?  Is that--
Speaker 2: Well, no, you know, I'm glad you said that because, of course, Mardi Gras was, that was the fun period of the year.  And it wasn't just one day, you know.  It led up to that.  They would almost start, parades would start a month before Mardi Gras Day.  So the revelry, the parades, the music, the beads, the trinkets being thrown, that was our, I think one of our--other than Christmas, Mardi Gras was a very favorite time because we would, my mother [Ursula Bernice Carrere] would dress us up in costumes, cowboys one year with little pistols on the side, Indian headdress the next year, clowns another year.  Every year, there was a theme.  She loved dressing us up, and we would join other family members and other friends in the median strip that you all from New Orleans don't know the real name down in New Orleans is called the "neutral ground."  We don't have median strips in New Orleans.  We have neutral grounds.  In other words, it's a neutral piece of land strip that cars don't roll on (laughter).  It's a different language down there.  My wife says you need a passport to get in New Orleans 'cause it's like a foreign country in the United States with their own language.  So I do remember Mardi Gras very fondly.  But we, I--that also triggered another sound and sight that I recall as part of my life growing up, was the brass bands parading through the streets for funerals, which you see nowhere else in the country.  But when someone dies--not everyone, but it could be a well-known figure or someone from--Catholics normally didn't do it, but the Baptist faith and the graveyard was right down the street from my house.  And so you have the brass band in front.  Behind that is the hearse.  And then it's the family marching behind the hearse.  And then it's everybody in the neighborhood behind that.  And that's what they call the "second line"
Speaker 1: Now, I've never heard that, what you just said about the Catholics don't do it.  I didn't know really, I never thought about who really does it in New Orleans, but that's (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I, from what I recall, it was mainly the Baptist faith.  They had, for I recall, I think a very nice way of looking at death, that they were actually celebrating the person going to heaven, and the way they celebrate is to give them a party, slow walk, with "Closer Walk with Thee," to the gravesite, and then after that, it was, they let loose, umbrellas and dancing and they're going to a better place.  I thought that was a neat thing.  But my mother, being a staunch Catholic, we enjoyed getting into the second line, and she says, that's not proper.  You know, we don't do that.  And I think we got spankings a couple of times.  But we kept going back.
Story_ID: 626531
Speaker 1: Okay, did any of your neighbors [in New Orleans, Louisiana] participate in Mardi Gras in the Indian tribes and the other groups like the Zulus and--
Speaker 2: Later on, not when I was growing up.  There were--everyone was in a social club, so to speak.  But back when I was growing up, the only club that I can remember, people of color could be a part of was the Zulus because you couldn't march in the parade in New Orleans in the '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s], unless you were part of the Zulus.  And the Zulus were formed as a mockery to the whites.  And so they would paint their faces white with big lips and cigars and it was like putting it in your face, you know.  People grew to--and this is white folks in the city, looked forward to seeing the Zulus, not knowing that it was, you know, mocking them for stereotyping us.  And so, but we couldn't participate.  I didn't have any neighbors that I knew of that were part of the Zulu until I grew up later.  And, of course, a lot of friends, even whites, became members of the Zulu, to this day.
Story_ID: 626532
Speaker 1: So, okay, so when you were growing up [in New Orleans, Louisiana], you were, you participated by having a costume and primarily, being a spectator to this kind of--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Mardi Gras, and--
Speaker 2: Active spectator.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I caught my share of Mardi Gras beads and coconuts (laughter).
Speaker 1: And (unclear) where the coconuts are hollow, right.  They're like hollow--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Replicas of coconuts (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: They're real coconut shells?
Speaker 2: Actually, in recent times they became hollow, and some were plastic.  Back then, they were coconuts with milk inside, decorated, and they got so dangerous because the Zulu members were throwing 'em off the floats, and people were actually getting injured.
Speaker 1: Now, this is what the lawsuit, we were talking off-camera about did Desiree Rodgers' father, who was an attorney named Glapion who defended the Zulus for hitting people in the head with the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It was alleged that they would spot somebody they didn't like or some enemy of the community and--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --deck him with a coconut.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That wouldn't surprise me (laughter).  Or if you call 'em a name while you're passing by, you know, "What're doing with that face painted up like that?" yeah, you could get a coconut knot in your hands (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's a dangerous--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, I do believe in recent times they either made 'em drain them or they ensure that they handed them to someone.  But you could no longer throw a coconut.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Unless it made out of plastic, hollow plastic (laughter).
Story_ID: 626533
Speaker 1: Okay, so, all right, so this is--so did you have a favorite subject in grade school?
Speaker 2: Favorite subject.  Recess.  No, I wasn't fond of, ironically, history, back then.  And now I'm a passionate student of history.
Speaker 1: Why is that?  Why do you think that's true?  Was it because of the way they taught it?
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly.  I didn't see much in the history books that related to me, other than being, of course, an American, you wanna learn about George Washington [President George Washington] and Abraham Lincoln [President Abraham Lincoln] and folks like that.  But I didn't see anyone that looked like me in the books, except maybe Crispus Attucks, and that was really it.  And the way it was taught, it was, to me, it was just--they were trying to get through it.  It was painful.  There was a lot of memorization, but not a whole lot of depth of what did that really mean?  And like, again, like I said, you know, wow, is there anyone in that did something famous that, you know, a person of color?  And I didn't see it.
Speaker 1: Now, when we were kids, I think the one thing I did notice about New Orleans [Louisiana], even though I lived in Ohio, was there was one year, they made a movie about the Battle of New Orleans with Charlton Heston.  Do you remember that?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do, yes, I do remember that.  I don't know, was it called the "Battle of New Orleans"?
Speaker 1: I'm not sure what the name was, but--(simultaneous)--["The Buccaneer"]
Speaker 2: But I do remember Charlton Heston playing in that.
Speaker 1: Yul Brynner played Jean Lafitte.
Speaker 2: And he played Andrew Jackson.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, it was a big blockbuster movie.
Speaker 2: Yeah, ah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And they advertised it in our 'Weekly Reader', remember those?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, I do remember 'Weekly Reader'.
Speaker 1: 'Weekly Reader', and we're about the same age.  So, yeah, that was a big--and one of these pop musicians had a, had the song, "The Battle of New Orleans" on the radio on pop radio, in the top 40.  I don't know if you remember--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I do, yeah.
Speaker 1: So--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, math wasn't exactly my favorite subject, which is why maybe I didn't become an engineer.  But I did, I was intrigued by some of my science courses.  I was particularly interested in chemistry back then, the experiments and whatever.  And that later on carried--
Speaker 1: Did you get a chemistry set at home?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I had a chemistry set in a little metal box, and my little test tubes with little aluminum racks.  I remember it very well, with little food coloring and, if I remember, one of 'em was a little bottle, which we probably shouldn't have back then, but they didn't know it.  It was a bottle of phenolphthalein which was clear and one drop would turn the water in the test tube to red.  It was a testing chemical.  So, yeah, I remember it very well.
Speaker 1: Okay, and this is, this almost put you a step closer to being a pharmacist--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, that was part of it.  I was intrigued with chemistry, although I didn't go into that field either.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I also enjoyed writing way back when.
Story_ID: 626534
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you went on to Xavier Prep [High School, New Orleans, Louisiana], right?
Speaker 2: Xavier Prep, Xavier Prepare--Xavier University Preparatory was the long title, but better known as Xavier Prep.
Speaker 1: And, you know, I know from, you know, our interview with Norman Francis that Xavier is famous for pharmacy.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, I mean the university is--
Speaker 2: It's probably the premier pharmacy school anywhere South.
Speaker 1: Okay, I would assume that the chemistry department of the high school would be good.  I don't know, but--
Speaker 2: Well, it was.  Xavier Prep had some superb teachers.  The one I remember being most attracted to, and the one I hated the most, to be honest with you, was history.  It was taught by the football coach.  And it was so dry.  It was just excruciating to sit in a classroom.  And the girls, for some reason or other, always were smarter than the guys.  And they aced history tests, and we tended to flunk 'em, and we would flunk 'em the way he taught us history through osmosis.  He would take us down to the coach's office and give us the battle for failing a test.  And so we felt history on our tails.  So, you know, history wasn't a favorite until I went in the [U.S.] Coast Guard.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: Now, were there any--well, go ahead.
Speaker 2: One of the, my favorite subjects was mechanical drawing.  I loved the shop, but I loved mechanical drawing in particular.  And so as I got into high school, I also considered being an architect at one time.  And it actually is an adult hobby of mine right now, is designing houses and I get joy--I can spend hours with, you know, a ruler and a pencil and drafting paper and sometimes I surprise my wife.  She says, you should have been an architect with trying to be precise, which is maybe to her, a fault of mine.  So, yeah, high school, mechanical drawing class.  I spent a lot of time in the band.  I was four years in the band.
Speaker 1: What did you play?
Speaker 2: Percussion, tympanis, snares, bass, cymbals, didn't do the xylophone, but, in fact, I was the president of the high school band in my senior year.  And, as a spin-off, we got so excited that I, we started a combo and won a second-place talent show with our little band.
Story_ID: 626535
Speaker 1: There are so many, so many kinds of good music in New Orleans [Louisiana].  What kind of music were you--now, this would have been in late '60s [1960s], right, '68 [1968], '69 [1969]?
Speaker 2: It would have been '68 [1968], it--'64 [1964] to '68 [1968] is when I at the Prep.  Some of the popular songs at that time, like "Knock on Wood."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, of course, jazz was always a part of me 'cause my cousin who lived with us, and he was, he was like an uncle.  He was much older than us, but he came to live with us, and he was a jazz musician.  He played the drums, and that's the way I started falling in love with drums, is because of, who we called, "Cuzie," Bergeron.
Speaker 1: What's his name?
Speaker 2: Edwin Bergeron, B-E-R-G-E-R-O-N.  In fact, his name, my Uncle Sidney, who was a jazz saxophone player, and my great Uncle George, who was a violinist, all have their names on a historic plaque on the family home in New Orleans.  So I did come from a--
Speaker 1: Sidney, isn't that--well, you know, I'm scared to ask.  It's not Sidney Boucher, is it?
Speaker 2: He's not Boucher, but they all played with Boucher.
Speaker 1: Did they?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  My cousin, you know, Edwin Bergeron, played the drums with Sidney Boucher, and Uncle Sidney Bergeron, played with Louis Armstrong and Boucher and a few other great, Jazz greats.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this, you had a lot of musical influence?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Did you know the Marsalis family?
Speaker 2: Ellis Marsalis, the father, taught me music in the [Xavier] University.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, what an incredible man, incredible man.  I didn't know Wynton at that time 'cause he, I don't think he was old enough to be in college then.  He was a little bit younger than I was, but very impressed with Ellis Marsalis.
Speaker 1: Did you know Harold Battiste?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's a man that we interviewed?
Speaker 2: Oh, did you?  I went to school with his son, Harold, Jr., yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, we can probably just take all--to another stream here--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No--
Speaker 1: --just about music (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah--.
Story_ID: 626536
Speaker 1: High school [Xavier University Preparatory High School] was an enjoyable period for me.  The nuns not only were great teachers, but it was just a fine school.  And one of my fondest memories was running for student body president in my senior year.  My wife laughs about it now because one day we, not that long ago, were sitting with one of my classmates.  And he said, he said, let me tell you about your husband.  And he starts relaying what happened during that campaign.  And I hadn't heard the story before, but he says, you know, we were rooting for another guy, not Steve.  We were rooting for Michael Kiffer (ph.).  And Mike got up there, and, you know, Steve, it was kind of frightening 'cause my mother [Ursula Bernice Carrere], who always liked to be involved like Mardi Gras costumes and anything else, she had lollipops.  Instead of cigar, she made lollipops with a little tag, "Vote for Steve Rochon."  And so I was passing out lollipops throughout the campaign for weeks.  She made posters, Larry [Crowe; interviewer for The HistoryMakers], big posters with my face (laughter), "Vote for Steve Rochon."  And they were all over the school.  I had my banner on the rooftop with pep rallies, you know, playing.  So it was pretty wild, but he says, but your husband came in this blue blazer with his embroidered patch on the pocket, and white shirt and tie, and Michael Kiffer shows up with his shirt hanging out of his pants.  And he said, I remember asking him, I said, Mike, you know, where's your speech.  And he said, Mike said, Ah, ah, I can't find it.  So his speech wasn't quite prepared.  But I got up there, he said, looking all sharp, and one of the punch lines in my speech that my brainy president of Tuskegee University brother, put in there was the "lollipop days are over."  Now, we're here for business.  And I thought it was a serious line, and the whole auditorium of kids just cracked up, "the lollipop days are over."  He says I knew at that point, we had lost the race (laughter).  And just two days ago, Michael Kiffer called me out of the blue and said, Steve, we gotta get together.  He ended up being my vice president.  That was the consolation.  He was a--
Speaker 2: So you won the--
Speaker 1: I, yeah, I won, and he was right there by my side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Just great memories of that four years.  I was the second to the last class of boys before Prep went to all girls 'cause the nuns couldn't afford sports and keeping the boys there any longer.
Speaker 2: Now, was that--did you play any sports while you were there?
Speaker 1: I ran track, and I threw shot put--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --for a couple years.  But most of my extracurricular was the band, marching and concert band.
Story_ID: 626537
Speaker 1: Now, did you consider music as a career?
Speaker 2: I did.  I really loved the drums.  And later, in my little band that won that--while I was in high school [Xavier University Preparatory High School], we won second place in a talent show at the university [Xavier University].  I says, wow, this might be my calling.  And we end up going to a gig on, right off Bourbon Street on Iberville, the club burned down the next day, and that was the end of my career (laughter).  I signed up for the [U.S.] Coast Guard 'cause Vietnam was there.  And I donated my drums to the church.
Speaker 1: Now, you started, you had already started college though, right?
Speaker 2: I did.  I started college.  I was starting my first semester as a junior, and I was in pharmacy.
Speaker 1: All right, so you had a famous pharmacy department at Xavier--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and, so how were you doing in school?
Speaker 2: I, very honestly, I had two friends that are still my closest friends.  And we believed in 2.0 because we were enjoying Xavier too much.  And one of my friends, we called him "Wizard" because he was the brightest out of the three of us, to be honest with you, a whiz in math.  And he's the only one that didn't finish college.  The rest of us went on, the second time around.  But while I was there, we just, we just enjoyed the school too much.  And so as Vietnam came around, you know, those that were average students and just holding on were prime targets for the draft.
Story_ID: 626538
Speaker 1: Okay, now, this is--let me go back to '68 [1968] for a second 'cause it's a tie-in to your trip in 1960.  And Dr. [Martin Luther] King was assassinated in '68 [1968]--
Speaker 2: In '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: --did you, I'm sure your family probably discussed the Lorraine [Hotel], and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, we did.  In fact, and I regret to this day that I knew we stayed on the second floor, and he [Dr. King] stayed on the second floor.  But I regret not retaining or my mom [Ursula Bernice Carrere] having receipts on where, which room we stayed in.  I would have loved to have known, had it been the same room.  And I always wanted to go back to the Lorraine.  I passed by it once, but I always--and now, it's a historic site, to see if I could recall--'cause I recall going up these, I think it was fire escape, metal stairs to the second floor.  I remember the room, but I don't remember which room it was.  And I think one day I might do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was there violence in New Orleans [Louisiana] after Dr. King was killed?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it was, unfortunately, it was in some of the areas that, where we lived, you know, even here in [Washington] D.C. [District of Columbia].  You know, those areas, we knew if you went to--and I wasn't a part of it 'cause my mother would not allow me to participate in that.
Speaker 1: You would have been a senior in high school [Xavier University Preparatory High School] then, right?
Speaker 2: Right, right, I mean, of course, it was grieving and tears, but we were not--she was a strict disciplinarian.  I mean I still feel the belt on my backside, and we wouldn't be caught dead being involved, back then.  Later I did, but in '68 [1968], we were not a part of what was in the streets.  We just ached and grieved, you know, inside our home.

Speaker 1: Okay, so, now Xavier University [New Orleans, Louisiana], is it--are the campuses continuous, the prep school [Xavier University Preparatory High School]?
Speaker 2: Totally different--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --areas.  It's maybe five miles apart in the city.  [Xavier] Prep is clearly uptown, close to the river, walking distance from the river.  And Xavier is off of Carrollton Avenue in a different area.  It's not even walking distance.
Speaker 1: Okay, five miles (unclear) [unmic'd].
Speaker 2: It may even have been more than that.  I think it's probably a little more than that and not an easy bus route between the two schools.
Speaker 1: I think I mentioned this once before, but did you have any, in terms of Xavier University, did you have any mentors or any special teachers there that you remember?
Speaker 2: In the university?  Yes, one individual that I thought so highly of, and I think he is still there.  He was Dr. Carmichael, chemistry.  And a Caucasian gentleman, who was dedicated to those students, a great, great guy.  And he took me in, tutored me in chemistry often.  If I remember, mom [Ursula Bernice Carrere] even had him to the house.  Anybody came to her house 'cause they knew they were gonna get a great meal.  He stood out.  There were a couple of nuns that are no longer there.  I think Sister Grace Mary is still there.  She was biology, and she was wonderful.  The one that I think I was more attached to than anyone was Sister Mary Kleinhaus (ph.) who taught math.  And that's when I started liking math, was because of her.  And Dr. Francis, you know, was, has always been close to the family.  He started the same year I became a freshman.  And as you know, he's the longest serving university president in the country, black or white, and still going strong.  You know, you don't think that that guy is in his eighties.  He's just still vibrant and active.  And I got in trouble because I, my mother was so well known at Xavier, and so well known with the nuns.  And I was a sophomore at that time, and one of my buddies who's still a dear friend was really--he was one of the guys that loved to protest, and we got on this kick 'cause Xavier didn't have any African American history studies at that time.  And so to make a long story short, we sat in outside Dr. Francis' office.  And we locked arms and chanted.  And someone, and I should have known better that this would happen, but they called her at the chemistry lab.  And they said, you should see what your son is doing right now.  And my mother, she marched over to that administration building, right outside President Francis' office, and I saw her coming down the hallway.  And I said, guys, I'm a have to get up.  My mother's coming, and I need to go meet her.  So I met her halfway.  Oh, did she give me an earful.  She says, you are embarrassing me so much, after all these years I've put in this school.  And you're gonna come here and ruin it, and the nuns are calling me, and they're ashamed of you.  And I said, but Mom, we're here for a cause, you know.  We're trying to get black studies here, and, of course, she gave me some choice words about black studies.  And she says, and guess what, you're walking home today (laughter).  So she left me behind.  That was my last protest 'cause it didn't end there.  But Dr. Francis has always been just a wonderful man and a great influence in my life, as well as the nuns there.  Another really great guy was Dr. Vincent Price in chemistry, just a jewel of a person.  So I had a lot of people there, and I had a lot of uncles and aunts that weren't relatives.  It was hard to go wrong there because people knew my mother.
Story_ID: 626540
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you join a fraternity or--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.  I thought it, about one time in pledging in a pharmacy fraternity.  I can't even remember the Greek letters.  Right now, I can't remember the pharmacy Greek letters.  They didn't have fun like the other guys, the Kappas, the Deltas and all that.  They didn't have fun like those, so that wasn't, you know, like I'd mentioned before, I was a 2.0 student in chemistry.  But we had one guy that was another instructor, Dr. Peter Paytash, who was most difficult.  He loved dishing out Fs [grade].  In fact, he was the part inventor of Dial soap at little old Xavier University.
Speaker 1: How do you spell his last name?
Speaker 2: P-A-Y-T-A-S-H, Paytash.
Speaker 1: Okay, he was a partial inventor of Dial soap?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.  Now, that's the story we've always been told.  He was an eccentric little guy with a lot of blonde hair all over the place.  He looked like [Albert] Einstein, and he was just tough.  He didn't explain things well, but he sure liked to dish out Fs.  So it didn't help my GPA [grade point average] at all.  And that was the time that it was in the heat of Vietnam, 1970.
Speaker 1: So was your grade point average in trouble when you--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.  I was, honestly, borderline 1.920.  My mom [Ursula Bernice Carrere] said I should have dropped them friends of mine, you know, because they were not the best influence.  But they were my buds, and--
Story_ID: 626541
Speaker 1: Well, who told you about the [U.S.] Coast Guard?
Speaker 2: Well, I wasn't looking--at that point, my grade school thoughts of being in the military had changed.  And this was, I wasn't an active protester of the war [Vietnam War], but I have to admit, either because of company or press or whatever was going on, I felt a part of the protest, quietly.  So I wasn't going in the military.  I said, oop, I want no parts of it.  So I got this little letter that said, "Greetings, report to your Selective Service Board for your physical."  And that was at the time that they'd just started the lottery system.  And I can recall that flashing across the TV, of all the numbers that were being called.  And I was--111, was my lottery number, and it went past 111.  And I said, oophs, something's gonna happen here.  And someone that always wanted to make my own decisions, I decided not to just go down to the Selective Service and be drafted.  I wanted to have my own choices.  And so I started thinking, okay, where do I wanna go, what do I wanna do?  If I have to do this, and have to go in there and serve my country for a couple of years, what's the best service?  I had a first cousin that was in the Coast Guard at the time, and he says, Steve--no, he didn't call me Steve.  I had a nickname back then that I don't mention too much, but--well, I'll mention it.  What's the heck, I was called "Poncho."
Speaker 1: Called Poncho?
Speaker 2: My, my father [Gilbert Leonard Rochon], when he was around, and I was a little tyke, a toddler, you know, a hotel in St. Louis [Missouri], he had these kids, and there was not enough beds, so he pulled out a drawer, and put a pillow in it.  And that's where I slept.  And he picked me up one day, and my mother [Ursula Bernice Carrere] said, and I had this curly hair all over my head, big curls.  And he says, he said, I'll be darned if I don't have a little Mexican.  I'm gonna call you Poncho.  That stuck with me until I left for the Service.  And I don't allow anyone to call me that now (laughter).  But at any rate, I, he says, go check out the Coast Guard.  He says, it's a great outfit.  I'm enjoying it.  Before you go talk to anyone else.  And I did.  I went on Canal Street [New Orleans, Louisiana] in a custom house.  And I was impressed immediately by this tall, 6'2" [height], black gentleman in these bell bottoms.
Story_ID: 626542
Speaker 1: Okay, so [U.S.] Coast Guard, you met a brother in bell bottoms (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, 6'2" [height].  I'll never forget him, SK-1, Henry Dillsworth, D-I-L-L-S-W-O-R-T-H.  And he was the first one when I walked in that office.  And I said, God, that's an impressive man, tall guy in these bell bottoms, and got this flack tie, kerchief around his neck and white piping, you know, coming down here, and I said, man, that looks pretty sharp.  And so we started talking, and I said, my cousin told me I should check this out, you know.  And he said, Ah, Rochon, you know, it's a good outfit.  And I says, well, tell me what those stripes mean on your arm.  He had an arm full of stripes we call hash marks, and each stripe means four years of service.  But the rank was up here, and I said, what is that?  He said, I'm a second-class petty officer.  And I said, oh, okay, that sounds impressive.  I says, what's the next step from there.  He says, you become a first class.  So I said, well, how long does it take to become a first class?  And he says, well, you won't have to worry about that Rochon because you have you--you have to wait till your second term, your second hitch.  He said, I've been in, you know, a good fifteen years, and I'm second class.  So I says, well, how quickly can you make first class?  And he says, well, there're some people that make it in under four years, and we call 'em "slick arm first."  In other words, they have nothing on this arm 'cause they don't have enough years to have even one stripe representing four years.  So sometimes people make it in less than four years.  He said, but don't worry about that.  That doesn't happen.  I said, but is it possible?  And he says, yeah.  And I said, okay, great, not realizing he gave me my first big goal in the service.  So to make a, to make it short, I signed up.  Two weeks later, I told my mother [Ursula Bernice Carrere] good-bye, and my buds, gave my drums away to the church and went off to Alameda, California.
Speaker 1: Now, how did your mother feel about you joining the Coast Guard?
Speaker 2: Well, she knew it was either that or the [U.S.] Army.  And she says, the lesser of two evils in her mind.  And she said, my son might come back alive, if he's on a patrol boat.  Now, there was a waiting list in the Coast Guard to get to Vietnam 'cause we had these patrol boats, and they, we had some significant casualties over there.  But there were so many people that wanted that duty on the river that I thought my chances of going over there were kind of slim.  And I was right.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so this is 1970?
Speaker 2: 1970--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: November 21st.
Story_ID: 626543
Speaker 1: And I don't, I think if I'm--correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think the end of the war [Vietnam War] was in sight at that point?
Speaker 2: No, no, I think that was even before the TET offensive, if I recall, yeah, I think it was before the TET offensive.  Things were really heating up then.  So I went in, went to boot camp, went to my first [U.S.] Coast Guard cutter, first ship in Oregon.  And I kept thinking about [Henry] Dillsworth [whom he met at the Coast Guard office in New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: And now, boot camp, now, we don't wanna skip past that too fast, but like what is that like in the Coast Guard because--
Speaker 2: It was pretty rough.  It was, it was no different than the other services.  It was the push-ups and the marching and, you know, if one person messes up, the whole, you know, company suffers.  I really admired my boot pusher, the company commander, white gentleman, just--I liked his style.  He wasn't one that always yelled at you, particularly, if you were doing things right.  Some didn't discriminate.  If you were a boot, you were gonna get yelled at.  But I liked his style, and what I remember about him, 'cause Dillsworth was a storekeeper.  So he had the crossed keys, which means he keeps the stores and the money and whatever.  But this guy had an anchor over his stripes, and he had three stripes, three chevrons which meant he was a first class.  And I says, that's interesting.  And the thing that motivated me 'cause I was, my first wife was in school with me--
Speaker 1: This is--
Speaker 2: --we weren't married then.  But I says, you know, if I choose a rate--oh, and by the way, I scored on the test high enough to select any rate I wanted, whether it be a technical rate or storekeeper or yeoman or whatever.  And, but I knew that those other rates, I found out that the other rates meant that soon as I got out of boot camp, I would go to another school.  And I wanted to go home and get married.  Well Boatswain mate, you didn't have to go to school.  Boatswain mate was on-the-job.  They called it striking.  It was on-the-job training.  So I said, okay, that's great.  At least I can go back after I'm finished boot camp in Alameda [California].  And it was, it was tough.  I remember one guy, he was a chronic bed wetter, and a couple of commanders got so upset that he made us all take our mattresses and march around the compound with the mattresses above our heads, pushing up on the mattress like that.  And I thought I was gonna die.  My little arms was not used to that (laughter) from New Orleans.  And so it was, it was rough, but yet that team, that camaraderie.  We all started clicking, and I got my bell bottoms, just like Dillsworth and went off to a ship, Coast Guard cutter, and took my test.  I--before I was finished with one test, I was ordering another.  And before I knew it, I was a second class, Boatswain's mate in two years.  And then I went back to New Orleans and became a recruiter in the same office that Dillsworth recruited me.  And he had since moved on, but I couldn't wait to get a hold of him because in three years, three and a half years, I made first class--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: I became a slick-arm first.
Speaker 1: Okay, so after two years, you were back in the same recruiting office, recruiting--
Speaker 2: Two and a half years, almost--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Two and a half years, okay.
Speaker 2: Back in the same recruiting office.  (Simultaneous)
Story_ID: 626544
Speaker 1: Let me just ask this before we move further, what does the Boatswain's mate do [U.S. Coast Guard]?
Speaker 2: They're boat drivers.  They take care of the ship.  They're, they tend to be the helmsman on the larger cutters, which is one of the jobs that I really enjoyed.  They sometimes act as navigators on the smaller ships.  They're the super deck guys, you know.  They take care of the painting and the scraping and everything in tip-top shape.  But mainly, they're, in the title, Boatswain's mate, they handle boat driving.  They're the coxswains normally, in small boats.  And I thought that was pretty exciting too.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay, but you make like first class in three years?
Speaker 2: In three and a half years, yes.
Speaker 1: So is that the equivalent of, say in the [U.S.] Army, a sergeant or something.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was E6.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, and [Henry] Dillsworth [whom he had met at the Coast Guard recruiting office in New Orleans, Louisiana] told me don't worry about 'cause it was next to impossible.  But he, he's the one that made me wanna beat the odds.
Speaker 1: So slick-on first?
Speaker 2: Slick-arm first, and because of that, a lieutenant in the, in that building, in a district office who was in charge of all the recruiters--and that was a fun job.  I had most of Southern Louisiana, even my hometown, my grandfather's hometown, my father's [Gilbert Leonad Rochon] hometown in Lake Charles to recruit and did pretty well in bringing folks into the Coast Guard.  But this lieutenant sort of noticed me, and he says, he said, Rochon, you've got some potential.  He said, had you ever considered going to Officer Candidate School?  I said, nah, I'm gonna get out.  You know, I wasn't gonna be in past four years anyway.  But to accept that recruiting job, I had to extend a year, so it would have been five years before I could get out of uniform 'cause I really wanted to go back to school.  I wanted to get back to Xavier [University].  And so I, I thought about it, and I talked to my spouse at the time.  And I said, wow, this is an opportunity.  If someone saw something in me that I can become an officer, maybe I should consider it.  And so I talked to a number of people, and I decided to take the test.  And I took the exam and, and the score was pretty decent.  And they say, okay, it's up to you.  And talking with the family and my mom [Ursula Bernice Carrere] and whatever, I says, I, you know, I'm starting to really like this outfit.  And I think that's what I wanna do.  And so, the rest was history.  After that I went to Yorktown, Virginia for Officer Candidate School and became an ensign.
Story_ID: 626545
Speaker 1: While I was in school, in OCS [U.S. Coast Guard Officer Candidate School, Yorktown, Virginia], Week 11, out of 17 weeks, my former wife called me and said, I'm not, I don't wanna be married any longer.  And I wanna see the world.  And that phone booth, that phone booth became so small 'cause it caught me completely off guard.  And I had a son, three-year old son.  You go figure.  My father [Gilbert Leonard Rochon] left when I was three [years old], and she wanted to see the world.  And so I went immediately to my barracks, and I packed my seabag, and I says, I can't take this.  I'm leaving.  And I called my mother [Ursula Bernice Carrere], and, of course, crying on the phone, I said, Mom, I can't handle this.  I don't know what to do.  I've gotta come back and try to do something to save my marriage, and she says, you've got a son to take care of.  And you stay there, and you stick it out.  There's a future for you.  There's nothing back here.  And I listened to her.  And I did, I hung in there for six more weeks.  And my father, that's when I started a relationship with him.  I called him, and I talked to him.  And he says, son, hey, look, you know, we don't have an officer in the family.  All of us were enlisted.  He was in the [U.S.] Army only for a short while.  And he says, why don't you stay in and then try to get orders to California 'cause I want to spend some time with you.  And luckily, I got L.A. [Los Angeles] and that was the beginning of my relationship with my father.  We did everything together out there.  We, maybe did too much.  You know, he was very successful.  He lived in Beverly Hills.  He had a Rolls Royce, you know.  I thought that was kind of exciting stuff, you know.  He knew all the big private clubs and everybody knew Gil Rochon, and I said, you know, dad lives a fun life here, you know.  He had already moved on from his second wife (laughter), to the third and so I was a free bird.  And dad helped me forget about that let down.  And my wife at the time said, well, I have no room for a child either for what I'm planning on doing.  She met this guy in Sweden, and she wanted to go to Europe.  So I said, I want my son.  I says, you bring him out here in California, and I'm gonna take custody, and I did.  And I raised him since he was three years old.  So, and pretty nice years.  It was just the two of us.  I had to sneak him on duty sometimes because I couldn't find a babysitter.
Story_ID: 626546
Speaker 1: Some other people we've interviewed had a similar situation where they, I think it was actually as an officer in the [U.S.] Air Force.  It was, they couldn't have their son with 'em without being married.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: And they were--this was back in the '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they had a rule that, he was raising a son, you know, in his quarters by himself, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --because his wife had left, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But it was against Air Force regulations, but was there any regulation like that in the [U.S.] Coast Guard?
Speaker 2: No, none at all.  It was just, I mean you weren't supposed to have 'em on duty with you.  But, you know, we had, sometimes I had to do what I had to do.
Speaker 1: Okay, so where, I mean so did he [Rochon's son] live with you actually in the--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --in California?
Speaker 2: He lived with me in California.  When I first went out, I went out really, by myself 'cause they were still in New Orleans [Louisiana], and she [Rochon's first wife] was trying to make arrangements to move to California, and shortly after she got there, we went through the divorce proceedings and, and she was in agreement to give me full custody.  And so, yeah, he lived with me the whole time I was out there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so all right, so everything is coming together.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Except, except after serving three years in California as an officer, my father [Gilbert Leonard Rochon] was still becoming a big influence.  And I have to admit to you, his lifestyle really appealed to me.  You know, I saw dollar signs.  He owned a chain of drugstores, and then he owned a bakery.  He bought this big bakery, Bowie Pies, that made pies for Dolly Madison and all these other big names.  And he says, son, I'm a need some help.  And I saw the dollar signs, Larry [Crowe; interviewer, The HistoryMakers], I saw--I said, hey, this is my chance to really make it, to hit it big.  Well, I made a mistake 'cause I resigned my active-duty commission, and went into the reserve program to join my father's company.  And shortly after that, the company went bankrupt.  Dad's partner ran off with the whole payroll, wiped him out clean.  And I had already, you know, gotten off active duty.
Story_ID: 626547
Speaker 1: So I went to a community college.  I said, okay, what are you gonna do now?  You've got a son you've gotta feed.  I went into real estate, still doing my weekend drills.  I was with Century 21, actually doing pretty well, with my little gold coat and selling a lot of real estate and making some decent money.  But it kept bothering me that I didn't have my, I didn't finish my degree.
Speaker 2: So this is in the late '70s [1970s] or where are we now?
Speaker 1: I was in the late, '78 [1978], '79 [1979].
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, because I was commissioned in '75 [1975], and I spent, I left OCS [Officer Candidate School], yeah, in '75 [1975].  Yeah, so it was '78 [1978] when I got out and went to the [U.S. Coast Guard] reserve program, which was, you know, fun being a weekend warrior and then full time, you know, trying to make it big on my own.  But real estate started taking a major hit around that time.  That was in the early '80s [1980s].  So it was around '82 [1982] when I was really feeling the pain.  And so I start taking on other jobs while I was selling real estate, became an Amway distributor (laughter) and a real estate agent and a bartender, all because, you know, this kid, my son, needed, you know, a father that was making money.  I had already bought a house, and so, but my education bothered me, and community college was taking too long for me, part time.  And I says, you know, this is not working.  The real estate is not gonna, it's not cutting it.  I need to do better.  And so I called my mom [Ursula Bernice Carrere], and I says, mom, I says, I'd like to go back to Xavier [University, New Orleans, Louisiana].  You think there's a way that I can get back in.  I've got my VA [veterans] benefits.  And it's amazing.  They created a scholarship (laughter), St. Katharine Drexel Scholarship, for me to come back to Xavier, including my VA benefits.  So I moved, I packed my bags, sold my house, picked up my son, and we moved back into my mother's home in '82 [1982], and I did some part-time work with her, I mean not with her, but while I lived with her.  And two years, I switched to business.  So I went from pharmacy, and my father [Gilbert Leonard Rochon] was no longer in pharmacy, so it wasn't appealing to me anymore and switched to business and finished in business.  And I was going, still going to California every month for my Reserve Drill time 'cause I loved my unit, my Coast Guard unit.  And the way I financed it was I bought shrimp in New Orleans, 150 pounds of shrimp at $1.50 a pound, packed it on ice, put it on the plane with me, and sold it for $6.50 a pound in California.  And it paid for my rental car, my officer's quarters and my food.  And that sustained me for the two years until I went, my last, just before I graduated, I was being interviewed by Procter and Gamble [Cincinnati, Ohio]--there were a number of companies that were interviewing me.  One rifle company, I can't remember.  It wasn't Winchester, someone else.  Anyway, they were decent incomes, but, you know, it wasn't exciting.  And one day I went back to my Reserve Drill, and I was going through the active-duty pay chart.  I says, you know, I love the Coast Guard.  And I love the uniform.  Why not, why not see if I can go back on in active duty?  So I did.  They took me back on, and I stayed on active duty ever since.
Speaker 2: Okay, so this is after you got your degree.  So this would be '84 [1984].
Speaker 1: '84 [1984].
Speaker 2: Okay, so now is this when you're sent to Cleveland [Ohio]?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 626548
Speaker 1: So, you're the Chief of Reserve--
Speaker 2: Training.
Speaker 1: --of the Reserve Training Branch [U.S. Coast Guard]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in Cleveland [Ohio].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I had my little son with me.  We found a nice little place out in North Ridgeville, Ohio.  And things were going pretty well.  Cleveland wasn't the mistake on the lake that I heard about.  It happened to be one of, professionally, one of my best tours, getting exposed to different things.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there's a Coast Guard facility there on Lake Erie, probably a few, I would guess?
Speaker 2: There're a few, but the district office for the whole Great Lakes was right there, a block from Lake Erie.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I was in the district office at the time.
Speaker 1: All right, so you were responsible for states around the, recruiting around the lake?
Speaker 2: Every single state around the lake, mainly training, particularly, at that time, the Coast Guard wanted to specialize a group in what they called a port security unit.  And these were the first combat-trained troops, not the patrol boats during Vietnam, but these were port security specialists that would actually go out and probably do, not just offloading of ships overseas and protecting the [U.S.] Army and [U.S.] Navy as they were offloading explosives, which we've always done, even since World War I, but this was the first time we were in camouflage uniforms.  And that was my job to train those guys.  So I took 'em to the [U.S.] Marine base in Quantico [Virginia], and it was just really a great three years in Cleveland.  There was a lot of growth.  I started really feeling, as they say, your grove and your niche in the service, and then moved to Washington [District of Columbia] to headquarters for the first time.
Story_ID: 626549
Speaker 1: Okay, now, this is in 1987, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were chief of the Port Security Branch [in Washington, District of Columbia]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And what were your duties?
Speaker 2: I was a lieutenant then, and I was now, rather than training and taking the Great Lakes reservists to Quantico [Virginia] and doing the hands-on training, I was in charge of the Port Security Program.  So it was involving a lot of coordination with the other services in that field.  I did that for a couple of years.  And it included, including other things like the special interest vessels in dealing with Russian ships.  And so it was a great job.  And two years in that job, then I moved to another job in headquarters.
Speaker 1: Just a little bit about this though, so in this particular position, you have to make sure that ships entering the United States, their protocols are correct, right, in terms of their--
Speaker 2: Exactly, particularly like--'cause I had that job when I was in L.A. [Los Angeles], but on the ground, boots on the ground level, but to make sure that what we call SIVs, special interest vessels, did not come over late with nuclear material.  And so you had to develop a regimen for inspections of these vessels.  And so I was heavily involved with that program.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so you were there until 1990, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 626550
Speaker 1: Okay, then you served as a Chief of the Officer Programs Branch in 1990, still in [Washington] D.C. [District of Columbia], in--
Speaker 2: In headquarters.
Speaker 1: In headquarters.
Speaker 2: Actually, that--before that was officer recruiting.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was in charge of, the Chief of Officer Recruiting.  And that was still in headquarters, so everyone now that wanted to become an officer and go through OCS, and that's not including the academy.  That was as different animal all together, but those, like myself, that had a college degree and wanted to come in as an officer, came through my program.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're still a lieutenant at this point?
Speaker 2: I was still a lieutenant, and I think just before I left that job to go over to Reserve Program management, I became a lieutenant commander.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So this is 1992 when you're lieutenant commander?
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 626551
Speaker 1: Now, what are some of the issues in the [U.S.] Coast Guard?  I know there's some notes here that--and I had forgotten some of this stuff myself, that, where you were stationed, it may not have been so much of an issue, but the Coast Guard had to do with, I think, refugees from Haiti and Cuba during the early '90s [1990s].  There was a huge influx of, what they call "boat people"--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --from Cuba and from Haiti.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, quite a bit, and, yeah, you're right.  I didn't, that was a different program--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --that I didn't have to deal with.  That was more on what they call the operations side of the house that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --dispatched cutters go to Haiti, and there was a lot of boat lift issues and, but, no, I didn't have to deal with that.
Speaker 1: Okay, I just thought I'd raise that (laughter), just to confuse matters.
Speaker 2: Oh (laughter), that's okay.
Speaker 1: No, no, I just, but (laughter), yeah, but that was like in the news.  If you read about the Coast Guard in those days, it had to with that issue (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --pretty much.
Story_ID: 626552
Speaker 1: Take us back to 1987, your first day in the United States Coast Guard headquarters?
Speaker 2: My first day in headquarters, that was sort of, you didn't know what to expect.  You were no longer, you know, hands on, dealing with issues in the field.  Now, you're gonna be a big desk jockey in the big puzzle palace.  And so I didn't know what to expect and particularly didn't know that when I pulled into the parking lot of headquarters, this very attractive woman pulls right next to me.  And I started chitchatting with her, and we walked all the way to the, across the street to the headquarters building.  She says I gave her my whole oral history (laughter), which is typical of folks from New Orleans [Louisiana], just to talk on.  It was so much that I frightened her.  And she hadn't given me the time of day for two years.  It took Alex Haley to get her to talk to me again because I was doing a special program for, a documentary and a big ball for this big name keynote speaker, the author of 'Roots'.
Speaker 1: Now, are you familiar with Alex Haley?  I mean, I guess the whole country was on some level in those days?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, oh, yeah, I had his book, you know, before then.  And I had, I hadn't met him until that point when he was gonna be my keynote speaker.
Speaker 1: So just give those watching, like a context on why Alex Haley's important to the Coast Guard.
Speaker 2: Alex Haley was, he was the first person that the Coast Guard created the journalism rate for.  We didn't have a rate like that before, and they were so impressed with his writing skills that the Coast Guard found a need--and back then, that was significant to have an African American be the first of anything.  And, but he had risen to the high enlisted ranks.  And so he became the first chief journalist.  He actually created that rating.  They created that rating for him.  Part of his reputation of his writing is he used to be on the Coast Guard cutter, and he wrote love letters for his shipmates to their wives and girlfriends.  So he became very popular, and then he started writing these wonderful articles about all the great things that the Coast Guard did around the country, around the world.  And so he was noticed, and he says, you know, we need a special rating like the [U.S.] Navy that is able to write these stories.  We need to have our image out there and let the country know the great things that this small, little Naval service does.  And that's why they created the journalism rate--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --for Mr. Haley.
Speaker 1: Now, just--I don't wanna hold the story up too long, but Alex Haley's rank in the Coast Guard was what?
Speaker 2: Chief Petty Officer, E7.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Same as, I can't remember the equivalent in the [U.S.] Army, but it's a step above staff sergeant.
Speaker 1: It's like master sergeant or--
Speaker 2: It may not be master sergeant.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It may be tech sarge, I'm not sure, but it's the E6 level, so it's the senior rank before you get into that, you know, chief or senior NCO [non-commissioned officer] position.
Speaker 1: So, E6, okay.  And--
Speaker 2: Well, he actually became E7, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: E-7.
Speaker 1: E-7.
Story_ID: 626553
Speaker 1: What was the percentage, I guess, of--or were there many blacks and black officers in the [U.S.] Coast Guard when you got involved?
Speaker 2: No, not at all.  My cousin was the first black officer that I'd met in the Coast Guard.  At that time, I think I could count on less than two hands how many black officers there were.
Speaker 1: This was in the entire Coast Guard as far as you knew?
Speaker 2: Entire Coast Guard.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I was an ensign, I knew of Merle Smith.  In fact, I met Merle Smith who was the first African American to attend the [U.S.] Coast Guard Academy.
Speaker 1: So this is in the '70s [1970s]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --the first is going to the academy?
Speaker 2: Right, right, the first to go to the academy.  He may have actually gone in the late '60s [1960s], but I'm not quite sure.  But it was somewhere around late '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s].  It had to have been '70s [1970s] when he went to the Coast Guard Academy.  But I would have to verify that.
Speaker 1: Now, this is trailing even the [U.S.] Marine Corps.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.  The Coast Guard was very much behind.  I'm trying to think if there was one--no, I don't know of any officer that went to OCS [U.S. Coast Guard Officer Candidate School] before Merle Smith became a student at the academy.  I used to know a lot of that history, but I would have to think back.  I know there were some--let me back up.  There were a couple in, during World War II who took the enlisted route and went enlisted chief to warrant officer.  And then from warrant, became a lieutenant.  So I believe we did have one in OCS.  I believe his name was Samuels.  He may have become the first officer that I can recall.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But when I became an officer, I mean it was far and few.  You didn't see us around.  And there was no one of the culture background that you could call a real mentor because there wasn't anybody much senior than I was at the time.  So you did reach out to the white officers, and there were some really fantastic officers that wanted to see you get ahead.  One I remember clearly was Lieutenant--Admiral Danielson in Cleveland [Ohio].  He was my district commander, and he was just a tremendous boss.  He probably gave me more incentive to hang in there and to continue my career 'cause he was just really a, just a decent man, a decent person.  I think he's still around or still alive.  So, yeah, you're right.  When I became an officer, there weren't too many people that I could rely on.  There were about a, maybe about eight or nine at the time.
Story_ID: 626554
Speaker 1: Okay, so I'm just--so Alex Haley, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --is coming, and he's just, his importance to the [U.S.] Coast Guard and to African Americans in the Coast Guard.  So he's visiting to lecture or talk about--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, I was asked back in '87 [1987], 1988, to speak at the Coast Guard Black History Month ball.  They wanted me to speak on the history of African Americans and the contributions to the Coast Guard.  And I said to myself, but I hate history (laughter), you know.  The way I was taught in high school, I remember Coach McKey (ph.) very well.  But I never turn down a challenge.  And I said, well, let's, I'll do it.  This could be interesting.  And so my first stop was at the Coast Guard Historian's office and pulled out this little file, labeled "Blacks."  That was the only thing I could find in the entire office and poured out this photo.  And here comes Alex Haley pouring out on the table.  And the [U.S. Coast Guard Station] Pea Island lifesavers and Black Maria who was a teamstress, a black teamstress who single-handedly beat off six highway men who were trying to steal the cannons off the first revenue cutter, the "Scammell," and she whipped the heck out of all of 'em.  And the Scammell was able to get its cannons and sail on time because of this black woman.  So I got fascinated.  I said, wow, man, this is some interesting stuff.  These are people that are doing tremendous stuff and, guess what?  They look like me, you know.  Alex Haley, Chief Petty Officer, author of the famous book 'Roots', and these lifesavers that did hundreds of rescues, and I couldn't wait to get to the Black History Month dinner.  I was loaded.  I said, I'm so pumped up and excited to share with folks that we have given something to this organization too.  And so I did a little, quick little spiel.  The second year I did one with a little 35 millimeter slide show, excuse me, slide show.  And then he says, look, we want you to be the chairman of the next ball.  And I says, look, guys, I'm not gonna do this little 150 person thing.  I says, anything I touch I gotta do it big time, and I want a thousand people at the biggest hotel in Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia], and I want a big name speaker.  And that's the only way I'm gonna get involved, and I want it black tie 'cause they were just doing this little business suit and uniform thing.  And so, and I said, I'm gonna handpick my committee.  And so I did, and we, it was an exciting time.  But I kept thinking about this lady that I'd met two years earlier in the parking lot who wouldn't talk to me.  And I says, this is another angle I could use.  So I went to her office.  She felt very intimidated.  I said, I--you know, I can't shake this guy.  He's gonna come in my space now.  And I says, hey, look, alls I need, I says, I need your expertise.  I need you to be on the Black History Month Committee, and I want you to be the one to introduce Alex Haley to the audience 'cause I was able to get him to commit to come up.  And, and I said, I need you on the committee to do that.  Well, she says, how can I turn this down now, (laughter) famous author and all this?  And so she came on the came on the committee, but she kept her eye on me because she says, he's up to something.  And I remember the week before the ball, we secured the Sheraton on Woodley, and a thousand people signed up, black tie, Alex Haley, ready to go.  And I says, who you going to the ball with?  And she said, oh, I hadn't thought about it.  I've been so busy on this committee and getting my speech together.  I said, oh, by the way, I need to look at your speech 'cause I proofread everybody's stuff.  She says, you're not touching my speech.  You'll hear about it at the ball (laughter).  And so we decided to date and that was the end of it.  I finally nabbed her, and that's the lady that came downstairs.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I got my wife, and thanks to Alex Haley, by using him.  That's a shame.  He didn't know that.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Actually, I let her be the escort the whole night with him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She took good care of him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I learned from him 'cause watching him and getting him through the airport and the hotel in a timely manner was next to impossible 'cause that man stopped and talked to everybody, kids--and I kind of mentioned that little motto or theme in the beginning, which was his motto.  He really lived that, even the guy in the hotel cleaning cigarette butts out of the sand container, he would go up to you--go up to the man and says, you know, you're really doing a wonderful job.  And you just don't know how important that is, that this hotel looks clean all the time, and it's all because of you.  And this guy's chest would raise up and say, hah, you know, this man is really something else.  And we, we kept an association, you know, until he died, just a great experience to be in his presence.  So I moved on, and I don't know if you're gonna go through every stage of my Coast Guard career--
Speaker 1: Well, I'm glad you went back to that one 'cause I was gonna ask you about Alex Haley at some point because I read that he was like a mentor, someone you learned--
Speaker 2: Yes, he was.
Speaker 1: --from.  So--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he, you learn not only from his words, but you learned from the way he treated other people.  And that's, like I said, that's been on my, all my coins that I created in that coin table display there, says, "Find the good and praise it," Alex Haley.
Speaker 1: Okay, "find the good and praise it."
Story_ID: 626555
Speaker 1: So, and so you were in [Washington] D.C. [District of Columbia] through '93 [1993], right?
Speaker 2: (No audible response).
Speaker 1: And what rank are you by then?
Speaker 2: '93 [1993], oh, that's a tough one.  Let's see, I have to back up.
Speaker 1: Oh, maybe not '93 [1993], I'm sorry--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: '95 [1995], I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was at headquarters until '95 [1995] and became an O-5, full commander, first time I was able to get the scrambled eggs on my cap and went to Activities, Baltimore or actually, Marine Safety Office, Baltimore [Maryland] at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what did you do in Baltimore?
Speaker 2: I was the executive officer [XO], the number two in command.  So I'd finally got to a point where I was in command cadre, and that name changed six months later to Activities Baltimore where I became the deputy with simply just changing terms, but the same number two in command.  And at that point, you know, I was what you, what we call a reserve program administrator, RPA.  It's active duty, but I'm not on the active duty promotion list.  It's on a reserve program list, and so I only compete against other fellow RPAs.  But at that time I, being in command cadre as a number two, it was the XO and the deputy, I says, you know, I would sure like to stay in, but I'd like to stay in and get my own command.  I thought I was ready for it then.  And I knew that it was next to impossible doing it as an RPA 'cause those command jobs were reserved for people that might possibly have a shot at a star.  And although I knew I didn't have a prayer to make flag officer because, one, in my mind, I was a RPA.  I was a drilling reservist at one point, and I was enlisted.  And as far as I knew, there were only two other people in the entire Coast Guard that made admiral coming from the enlisted ranks.  So it was strictly academy grad type deal.  So I says, I just want a command.  I wanna be able to get out there and run, you know, my own show, and do something great for the Coast Guard.  And so I knew the only way to do that would be to request to shift from RPA, Reserve Program Administrator, to the active duty promotion list.  And I was told many times, there's just no way.  No one that senior--and I was already selected for captain for 06, had ever transitioned to the active duty promotion list.  But by the grace of God, and a few great senior people, they allowed me to do it.  It was approved.  And I got accepted to National Defense University which is another stepping stone to get my masters degree, which was a national resource strategy.  And right after--
Speaker 1: So is this--what year is this, '96 [1996]?
Speaker 2: That was in '98 [1998].
Speaker 1: '98 [1998].
Speaker 2: And I graduated in '99 [1999].  I spent just, almost a year at Fort McNair [Washington, District of Columbia] in the Industrial College of the Armed Forces which is part of the National Defense University.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Story_ID: 626556
Speaker 1: And so I was really, I said, wow, this is really something to have this kind of opportunity.  I said, so how do I get my command.  And someone says, again, that's an uphill battle to get a major command as a brand new 06, just recently came from the Reserve Program Administration [RPA].  And so I says, but I want my command, and I want New Orleans [Louisiana] because that is the most active challenging job, probably in the [U.S.] Coast Guard with, you know, the Mississippi River and everything else.  And so I went shopping, and I talked with the assignment officer, and he says, you know, this is gonna be very difficult to recommend you for that position.  So I went to the top guy over Marine safety, two-star admiral, Admiral Bob North.  And I says, Admiral, I just wanna chat with you.  I says, I'm about to graduate.  I want a command at a Marine Safety Office really bad.  I said, I proved myself in Baltimore [Maryland].  And I think I could really--I'm the man for this job, but folks are telling me that I'm too junior.  And he says, Rochon, I don't think so.  I was junior too when I got my first major command.  Then he says, I'm gonna endorse you.  And the board met with Admiral North's endorsement, and a couple of other folks, Admiral Roger Ruth, which was another great mentor of mine.  And he wrote a recommendation letter, and they sent me down to New Orleans as captain of Port, which was an experience of a lifetime.  I didn't see my hometown because I was just too busy trying to keep ships safe in the river.  And so I thought that was the--this was the pinnacle.  There was no chance of going any further than that.  But this was the job that everybody, you know, would die for, is to have that kind of experience.  And I was ready to retire after that.  I even put the word out that I was running for the job of president of the Port of New Orleans, which was a civilian position, retiring, go to the Port.  And Admiral Paul Pluta, another great mentor who's--he became upset because I did so well on a major oil spill, 500,000 gallons of spill--of oil spilled in the river, light crude--
Speaker 2: Who spilled it?
Speaker 1: A Li--I believe it was a Liberian--
Speaker 2: tanker.
Speaker 1: --merchant vessel.  And, you know, we, it was a great team effort, but it was probably, in fact, it was, set the record for the most recovered oil from any major body of water.  It was something like 58 percent of oil recovered.  And it was just great teamwork, getting industry and my staff and everyone else together.  And I guess, you know, folks looked at that, and Paul Pluta, Admiral Pluta was, his staff was trying to get him to take over that spill.  And he called me up one day, and he said, Steve, my staff thinks that this is too big for the captain of the Port and that I should take it here, to the district.  What do you feel about that?  I said, Admiral, I've got this covered.  I have control of this spill, and with all due respect, I need to keep it down here.  And he says, go ahead and run with it.  And it turned out to be a great success.  And I said, but, sir, I'm gonna run for the Port of--president of the Port of New Orleans.  He says, Rochon, if you do that, you're gonna really tick me off 'cause I had high plans for you.  And I said, what do you mean, sir?  And he said, well, you know, you need to stick around and see what's gonna happen.  And I said, well, sir, there's no chance of being a flag officer, not with my background.  He said, how do you know that?  And shortly after that (laughter), I get a phone call from the commandant of the Coast Guard saying, "Welcome to the Flag Corps, you've just been selected for a one-star."  And I, it was just, I couldn't believe it.
Story_ID: 626557
Speaker 1: So this is rear admiral [U.S. Coast Guard].
Speaker 2: Yeah, rear admiral lower half (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is not--you're the, from what I understand, you were the second African American rear admiral in the entire history of the [U.S.] Coast Guard?
Speaker 2: Right, the first one was Erroll Brown, and I'd been so involved with minority recruiting and mentoring in a big organization, that when he made flag, I had, I had to attend that ceremony 'cause I didn't think it would ever happen in my history to see an African American become an admiral in the Coast Guard.  And I have to admit, it was some pretty heavy-duty tears watching Erroll Brown get his shoulder boards pinned on at that ceremony, never thinking that I'd even come close to that.
Speaker 1: So when did Admiral Brown get his commission?
Speaker 2: I believe that was 1997.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're like roughly three years later in 2000?
Speaker 2: Well, maybe it wasn't '97 [1997], no, it wasn't '97 [1997].  It was a little bit later than that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because I received the call in 2001.  So it had to been maybe 1999, 2000.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 626558
Speaker 1: So what was your assignment as rear admiral?
Speaker 2: My first assignment was outside of the [U.S.] Coast Guard.  It was with the Department of Transportation [DOT], which was our parent agency at the time.  We weren't, there was no DHS [Department of Homeland Security] 'cause there was no 9/11 [September 11, 2001; terrorist attacks] at the time.  Actually, 9/11 did happen, but it was still the Department of Transportation.  So I was asked to go over there because of my--I've had, you know, touring in intelligence and I also had quite a bit of port security background.  So I became Secretary Norm Mineta's [former U.S. Secretary of Transportation] senior advisor, and also director of security and intelligence for DOT [Department of Transportation].  And that lasted for one year.  It's traditional that flag officers don't stay in a job more than a year or two at a time.  Commandant warned me, says, Steve, get used to moving 'cause you guys, I gotta move you every year.  And so the next job, I was able--while I was there, I was instrumental for standing up TSA [Transportation Security Administration].
Story_ID: 626559
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause it, 9/11 [September 11, 2001; terrorist attacks] occurs while you're there [Department of Transportation (DOT)], right?
Speaker 2: It was, it occurred while I was there.
Speaker 1: That's September 11th, 2001.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And can you kind of just tell us about where you--what you were doing that day and, do you have any--
Speaker 2: Well, actually--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --it was before I became flag [officer] when 9/11 happened.  I was still the captain of Port in New Orleans [Louisiana], and I had just started a promotion board duty.  I was on a board in headquarters so I had to fly to headquarters, which was great because my wife was still living in Washington [District of Columbia].  And she was still working.  She's also a retired Coast Guard civilian.  And so I flew up to sit on this promotion board for, I believe it was commanders, a commander promotion board.  And it was the day of the board that was gonna convene that morning, and I was inside the headquarters building when someone yelled and says I need to turn on the TV.  You need to see what's happening.  And that's when we saw the first plane, after it had crashed in the World Trade Center.  And the board, obviously, started kind of late because then the next plane hit, and then the Pentagon was hit.  And I said, oh, my God, I've gotta get back to New Orleans 'cause we don't know what's gonna happen.  But I was there, and he says, no, you gotta finish this board.  You're XO [executive officer] and New Orleans can handle it until you get home.  And so it was, it was an unbelievable experience to see that that could possibly happen here.  And I did go back just a few days later and we had to secure the Port of New Orleans.  And to--we didn't know what was gonna happen beyond that.  So we had to protect the shipping and the port itself.  And so that was a major evolution, planning for the worst, the Superdome, you know, everything else that we thought were targets.
Story_ID: 626560
Speaker 1: Okay, so we were talking about, so you helped to develop a portion of what became--
Speaker 2: The Transportation--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --Homeland Security, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Transportation Security Agency [TSA].  You know, DOT (Department of Transportation) was then trying to get, to assist the president with establishing DHS, [Department of] Homeland Security, but DOT, transportation, owned FAA (Federal Aviation Administration).  That was one of the agencies under DOT.  So it was likely that this was the right agency to help develop protocols and create this new separate agency called TSA under DHS.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That job lasted a year, but before I left that job--and this is probably an important piece to mention, before I left that job, and I'm trying to think of the name of the vessel.  It escapes me, but there was a vessel that came into New York Harbor that was suspected of carrying nuclear material.  And that was in 2002, if I recall.  Oh, I'm surprised it's hitting my mind.  It was called the Palermo Senator.  I don't know if that rings a bell.  But it was a foreign vessel, pulling into the port, and it was some intelligence that said that it had nuclear material aboard.  The [U.S.] Coast Guard got involved, and seized the vessel.  And it was a lot of press coverage on it, a lot of excitement.  It found that it did not have the nuclear material, that it had, but it got so much press.  And right after that, I was one of the speakers in New York City--of course, now, this is following 9/11 [September 11, 2001; terrorist attacks], and everybody's still worked up, at a big international security conference, not too far from the destroyed World Trade Center.  And so I was speaking on this, but this reporter was stuck on, and he was from an independent paper, stuck on the Palermo Senator, and he kept asking questions.  And so I kept trying to, you know, answer in a general, saying that, hey look, we've got, you know, control of this now.  And we don't believe there's any concerns, but even after my speech, and he came up with other folks, 'cause they had microphones in my face.  And he kept badgering 'cause he wanted to sort of make a point that maybe the country wasn't doing enough to make sure we were safe.  And I told him, I said, this is in its infancy stage, but there is national dialogue on this amongst many different agencies.  Well, to cut it short, he went back and printed--because I left the conference.  But there were a lot of speakers that followed me, that apparently started talking about this.  I didn't address it in my speech.  But he attributed his whole article, which was totally twisted to me.  And I was shocked when I read the article.  And Secretary [Norman] Mineta [former U.S. Secretary of Transportation] called me, and he said, Steve, did you say all these things?  And I said, Mr. Secretary, none of that's true.  I told the Secretary exactly what I said, that there was a national dialogue with many different agencies to be able, to try to, you know, resolve this issue.  And he says, I know you better than that.  And he says, don't worry about it.  Well, the Coast Guard didn't know.  And I still, although I worked for Secretary Mineta, I was a Coast Guard officer.  So Admiral Tom Barrett, Vice Admiral Barrett called me.  He said, Steve, we're a little bit trouble, you know.  What is this all about?  I explained it to him also.  And he says, great.  He says, I know you better than that, you know, don't worry about it.  But we've got a captain of the port up in New York that has believed the newspaper, and he thinks that you're derailing his efforts up there.  And I said, you talk to Captain so and so and let him know, don't believe everything he reads, sir.  And so he liked the way that was handled, and I related that because right after that, I became director of Intelligence--not director of Intelligence, but acting assistant commandant for Intelligence for the Coast Guard.  And that was a year, one-year assignment.
Story_ID: 626561
Speaker 1: And then I left there [U.S. Coast Guard headquarters] and got a major command, became a, got a major command as an admiral in Norfolk [Virginia], which was great.  I was able to travel to Bahrain and Iraqi waters and check on [U.S.] Coast Guard patrol craft.  But the significance of what happened and how that incident was handled without getting worked up, I guess stuck with Vice Admiral Tom Barrett.  And I was retiring in ninety days from the [U.S.] Coast Guard--
Speaker 2: Now, this is in 2006 or seven [2007]?
Speaker 1: That was in two thousand--
Speaker 2: Seven.
Speaker 1: --seven [2007].
Speaker 2: Yeah, seven, 2007.
Speaker 1: I had 90 days left on active duty.  And that's when I received this phone call from the White House.
Speaker 2: Okay, so I don't wanna gallop past--
Speaker 1: Oh, did we miss--
Speaker 2: --you know, all the, just wanna revisit a little bit of this.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  I was trying not to bore you with all this--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And I don't know how much you can talk about, I don't know how much you can talk about in terms of being the acting assistant commander for Intelligence in the U.S. Coast Guard.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't know what you can tell us about that, but--
Speaker 1: Well, the Coast Guard had not been actively involved with the intelligence community, better known as the IC which contains most of the three-lettered agencies, CIA [Central Intelligence Agency], DIA [Defense Intelligence Agency], NSA [National Security Agency], and on and on and on.  But those are the--it's roughly nine, maybe now ten members of the intelligence community, FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation], all those three-lettered agencies.  But the [U.S.] Coast Guard, being as small as we were, was sort of like on the sideline.  Most of the time, we weren't even invited to some of these meetings.  But I wanted to get us more involved because we were dealing with a lot of alien migration issues and, down South, and quite a few drug interdiction issues.  And we needed some of the information that NRO [National Reconnaissance Office], NSA, Naval Intelligence, all these folks, we needed to know what they knew.  And you can't know if you're not at the table, if you don't have a seat.  So I started, you know, getting more, getting the Coast Guard more involved in having meetings at CIA headquarters, and it became where we, they didn't leave us out.  It was like automatic.  Well, is the Coast Guard here?  My predecessor, my successor, Mr. Jim Sloan, had come from the Treasury Department to take over, and he was pretty well known in the intelligence community.  And so I became his deputy.  So, and my predecessor was Fran Townsend, who is the big commentator on security on CNN, and you see her quite often on TV.  So I relieved her.  She was the first intelligence officer at that senior level, senior executive service.  I became the first Flag intelligence officer, which is sort of term of art among, within the military.  But Jim Sloan came after me when I got my command, when I received the command at Norfolk.  And he ran away with that ball, and now the Coast Guard is considered sort of one of the three-lettered IC, Intelligence Community, members.  So I felt pretty proud to be at the cutting edge--
Speaker 2: Cutting edge of the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --of getting us involved.
Story_ID: 626562
Speaker 1: One thing that baffled me and maybe baffled other people was that these agencies had not been working that closely together before 9/11 [September 11, 2001; terrorist attacks].
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: It just seems like it would just make sense that they would.
Speaker 2: It was so stove-piped, Larry [Crowe; interviewer, The HistoryMakers].  Everyone wanted their own little piece of what they knew and didn't wanna share it with anyone.  I think there's probably still some remnants of that.  I doubt if certain agencies still don't share everything they know with agencies that need to know.
Speaker 1: And then like another aspect that was scary too was the lack of modern technology being used amongst some of the big intelligence agencies.
Speaker 2: And now people are starting that it's too much modern technology (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, but in those days like there were kids that were hacking, they could--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --were outperforming the security agencies.
Speaker 2: Yeah, as we know, it's happening still today with the gentleman in Russia.  So, that was a good year.  It normally would have lasted longer, but I was anointed with a command, and no one turns down a command, particularly as a Flag officer.  And that was just a wonderful job down in Norfolk.
Story_ID: 626563
Speaker 1: Okay, so in Norfolk [Virginia], you were responsible for--
Speaker 2: Three quarters of the United States, forty states, for all the maintenance and logistics, legal, personnel, health, medical, engineering, although I didn't have an engineering background, engineers worked for me, a good 3,000 of them.  And that was supporting all the cutters and personnel and infrastructure in not only forty states in the United States, the Caribbean, Africa and Southwest Asia.
Speaker 1: And--well, before we leave the Coast Guard, tell us about your involvement in New Orleans [Louisiana] after Katrina [Hurricane Katrina; 2005].
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  You know, thanks, but you reminded me of a job in between Intel [Intelligence; acting assistant commandant for Intelligence in the U.S. Coast Guard] and getting command 'cause I did leave Intelligence and became Director of Personnel Management at headquarters [Washington, District of Columbia], which was a great job.  It was like being back home again 'cause I, I love the field of dealing with people and not just classified documents.  And so trying to make some changes in the programs to support not only Coast Guard people, but also their families, and then Katrina happened.  It devastated my hometown, and although there wasn't a perfect fit necessarily for me to get hands-on involvement, I started thinking through what were the crews going through personally, professionally and what were their families going through.  And I don't know if anyone really paid a lot of attention to that, but I realized that it was huge when I flew down within a couple of weeks after Katrina to visit 9 units that were heavily involved with the operation down there, including New Orleans, a unit in Texas, Mobile [Alabama] and a couple other places.  I was able to get a Coast Guard auxiliary aircraft and flew from city to city.  Hearing the issues that the people were going through, while they were out saving lives and cleaning up spills, what was happening to their families?  And there were some issues going on, and I was able to document all that I heard from these different major places that were having issues, and brought that back to the leadership at Coast Guard headquarters to let 'em know that we needed to pay attention to the people that had to skip town and had no way of connecting with their families.  Or there may have been financial issues, and so some things were resolved.  Some people were transferred out that did as much a job that they could do to go back and join their own families that were displaced by Katrina.  So that was a great feeling to be a part of that on that level.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, then you go to Norfolk [Virginia; a command assignment] after that?
Speaker 2: And then I went to Norfolk from there.
Speaker 1: All right, and we just talked about that, but--.
Story_ID: 626564
Speaker 1: Now, the phone call (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Now, the phone call.
Speaker 1: I guess it's time for the phone call.  This is 2007.  You're getting ready to retire [from the U.S Coast Guard], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, getting ready to retire.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Thinking about going back to New Orleans [Louisiana] to write my book that I had been researching for twenty-plus years, and on some famous African American lifesavers in North Carolina.  And--
Speaker 1: Is this the Pea Island--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: This is the [U.S. Coast Guard] Station, Pea Island--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which was in the 1800s, which was unheard of for an all-black crew that was post-slavery to run a station.  And that's another little story there.  But I was contemplating on trying to finish that book, move back to New Orleans, and the phone rings from The White House.  My secretary said, Admiral, The White House is on the phone to talk with you.  And I says, gheez, I've got ninety days left in uniform.  What did I do now to get a call from The White House?  Where did I go wrong?  And so I took the phone call, and the gentleman said that we'd like you to interview for Chief Usher of The White House.  And I, I kind of thought.  I had never heard of the title before.  But I says, I said, what the hell is a chief usher?  That doesn't sound too exciting to me (laughter), you know.  You reach Admiral and the someone's gonna call you an "usher."  Is that something where you have your little brown cap on the top of your head with a little short jacket and tight pants with a flashlight, showing people to their seats in the theater, you know (laughter).  And the guy chuckled a little bit, and he says, no, Admiral, it's much more involved than that.  And President [George W.] Bush is breaking tradition of fleeting up the deputy chief usher to become chief usher because he wanted to see, he wanted some leadership from the military community from the senior ranks.  And I said, well, I've never heard anything about this.  And he said, well, we weren't reaching out to Flag officers until Admiral Tom Barrett who you used to work for dropped your name 'cause he's now a civilian in the administration.  And he says, call this guy.  He's the man for the job.  That could have gone very different had I not had that nice conversation with him with the Palermo Senator and handled that reporter's situation a lot differently.  And so he kind of remembered, I think, and we had some history in some other things.  And so he's the one that dropped the name and said, call Rochon.  So this guy explained the job.  I would have ninety-five staff members, answering only to the President of the United States, taking care of the mansion that George Washington built, you know, executing all the state dinners and entertainers and he says, you also are preserving the most historic house in the country.  And that was the piece that sort of grabbed my attention 'cause although I started off in grammar school not liking history, in high school, maybe hating it because of my coach, and then being converted because of Pea Island, to hear that I would have, be a part of history, was intriguing.  So I says--and he says, Admiral, you haven't asked this, but here's what we're thinking for your annual salary.  And I says, hum, sounds like more than my retirement.  Now, you know, offer me a job where I could probably make a difference, but you're gonna pay me to do it too.  I says, yeah, I'll come interview.
Story_ID: 626565
Speaker 1: So I drove back and forth from Norfolk [Virginia] to D.C. [Washington, District of Columbia], nine trips, nine interviews, everyone up the chain.  The eighth interview was with the First Lady, Laura Bush, Mrs. Bush.  It lasted for about forty-five minutes and very comfortable but probing and wanted to know, you know, my background and how would I handle a staff and things like that.  And in my last interview, I standing outside the gate, the front gate on Pennsylvania Avenue, ready to go into the Oval Office to meet the president, and I says, you know, this is interesting.  This is the last interview, and I'm gonna meet the most powerful man in the world.  And so I started getting just a little bit, just a little bit nervous.  You know, you do your homework, but how do you handle, what do you do?  And so I called one of my mentors, Michael Jackson.  But he wasn't the entertainer (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He was the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security.  And I said, Michael, I'm about ready to go into the Oval Office to meet the President of the United States.  I said, you got any last minute advice for me?  And he said, he said, Steve, you've done probably your homework.  You know what the job's about.  He says, it wouldn't serve you well for me to just give you a lecture right now.  The only thing I can offer you is be yourself.  And I says, I think I can do that.  And so I enter the gates, and from the photos, you can see the president giving me a warm handshake as I walked into the Oval Office.  Of course, my first time in that office, so I was already in awe, and thinking, and you look at the Kennedy [President John F. Kennedy] desk, which I knew about.  And we sat down, and it was a very--he closed the door.  It was just the two of us, very comfortable, casual conversation.  And he, he didn't throw any--well, he did throw a couple little trick questions in there.  He says, Admiral, what do you think about this chief usher business?  And, apparently, he had thought about here's a rear admiral, and we're gonna call him chief usher.  And I says, well, sir, you know, what's in a title?  I'm just thrilled of the possibility that I might be working directly for the President of the United States.  So the title doesn't matter.  So he shook his head, like this [nodding], approving, I guess, of the answer.  And then the next question was a real ringer.  He says, Admiral, how is your marriage?  Now, all the years I spent in personnel, that's a question you normally don't ask.  But when you're the President of the United States, and you're in the Oval Office and the doors are closed, you can ask anything you want.  And I says, well, Mr. President, I think I have the best marriage in the world, second to yours.  And I guess he liked that answer.  And the next day, they called me and says, Admiral, you have the job.  And we want you to change the title for the first time in history since 1866.  And so it took me a day, and I came up with agreement from personnel to change it to Director of the Executive Residence.  And the historians wanted to add "and chief usher."  So I couldn't get rid of that one, and it's a pretty long title for a business card.  But it set me well.  It's a little bit, it's, it's better, I think, than Buckingham Palace [England].  They, my counterpart is called "Master of the Household."  Now, it sounds fancy, but can you imagine, here I am African American, going to work with maybe 40 percent African American staff.  And they're gonna call me "master."  I said, sounds like we're going backwards with that.  So I was very pleased to keep the title of chief usher and director of executive residence.
Story_ID: 626566
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, give us some little history on the origin of that position [Chief Usher of The White House] and what it entails?
Speaker 2: Well, it, the way it started, it was not a job titled "chief usher."  There were ushers, and they actually, during the time of [President] Thomas Jefferson and other presidents, they--and [President] John Adams, people would be able to come knock on the front door of The White House and say I'd like to have an audience with the president.  And so the person that answered the door would usher them in to the sitting room, and they would wait their turn to speak with the president.  Now, there would be a few million people knocking on the front door, but that's the origin of that job.  And then over time, it grew as the requirements of the house grew.  It needed someone to run the staff, the chefs and the butlers and the housekeepers, and then the physical plant.  And it was around 1886 that that title "chief usher" was given.  I'm trying to think of the, I know J.B. West was one of them.  The one just before me was Gary Walters, behind him was Rex Skalton (ph.), J.B. West, Dens Moore, you know, there were a couple other ones.  But as years progressed, and after the Truman [President Harry S. Truman] renovation, and after the executive residence became an official ceremonial place, not just the home of the president, but where you would entertain heads of state, with state dinners, and entertainers, the staff had to grow to keep up with that.  So that position now is the director.  It's like the general manager of a five-star hotel, except you have some pretty important guests.  And it does require a full team of engineers and carpenters and painters and butlers and chefs and florists and housekeepers and curators to preserve that house for hopefully, two--400 years from now.  So it was a major responsibility, and it was a 12-14 hour days often, average, 11, 11-hour days for eight hours pay, by the way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But the house was riddled with loyalty and you just stayed.  Not everybody got overtime, certainly not the ushers or the chief usher never got overtime.  But you had a job to do, and it was putting a face on America that, when you have a foreign minister or foreign head of state, you wanna make sure the president and this country--that head of state leaves this country realizing that everything ran perfectly.  And it was a great visit, and it facilitated maybe some major decisions in the Oval Office because of the whole experience of being there.  So we took the job very seriously.
Story_ID: 626567
Speaker 1: All right, now, just, before we get into what you actually did.  Historically, are you the first African American to take this position, the chief usher job [Chief Usher of the White House]?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, I am--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the first African American.
Speaker 1: Okay, and then the first one to change the name of it (laughter)--
Speaker 2: That's right (laughter).
Speaker 1: --to something else as well.  But there's a long history of African Americans as part of the service staff of the White House, right,--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --even thought they were supervised by traditionally white people to do different things, but they--the butlers, the maids, the cooks, barbers, you know, gardeners, you know, almost every job--
Speaker 2: Valets, yeah, yes.  Now, there's a long history.  In fact, George Washington, President George Washington, his cook--they didn't call 'em chefs then, was African American.  Now, he never lived in the White House, unfortunately.
Speaker 1: Right, 'cause it wasn't even built when Washington was--
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't finished then, but the history really goes back to being built because as you probably are well aware, slaves helped build the White House and carried those big, you know, stones and blocks and cinderblocks to create the White House or limestone blocks.  The staff throughout the years and particularly, when you see like the upcoming movie that portrays an African American butler [Lee Daniels' 'The Butler'], most of the staff, at least the butler staff, traditionally were African Americans.  Now, we, I think there's one Hispanic butler and there's been Hispanic butlers.  In the past and a part-time butlering staff, a large amount of the staff were Caucasian or white.  Housekeeping staff kind of split between all different cultures.  I'd say last time that I recall taking a gauge of how well are we doing in diversity, about 38 percent of the executive residence staff were minority, which is higher than the national average.  And I believe a good 25 percent were women, but the butlering staff, and it could be because that was the job that a lot of African Americans went into early on.  You know, in our history, a lot of the butlers were handpicked and normally, they are.  It's not--it's by word-of-mouth.  In the case of one that was, we're basing the movie on, he was handpicked from butlering at a private men's club.  So that job traditionally, I think, has been dominated by African Americans.  The usher staff, although I was the first chief usher, I was also the first on the usher staff in history.  And I, I'm proud to say I had something to do with even increasing that to women becoming ushers.
Story_ID: 626568
Speaker 1: There was one woman before I arrived there who was an usher, and another African American who flew on Air Force One.  He was the steward that ran the same service onboard Air Force One.  And he was retiring.  And he interviewed with me, and he wanted to be a butler.  And, you know, he was at one of the highest enlisted ranks.  I think he was an E-9.  And I said, Reggie, you know, you sure you wanna do this.  He said, oh, yeah, I'd feel very comfortable.  I said, well, you need to consider you know, other possibilities too.  And so he came to work with us.  I let him walk alongside the butlers at a big event.  And I saw something in him.  I says, you know, it's a very noble trade, being a butler, but this gentleman has spent all these years in leadership positions.  He was like a chief usher at 40,000 feet in the air.  And I says, Reggie, I think you would be better suited to come in the usher's office.  I need your talents.  I need your leadership.  And I think it was a little bit intimidating for him.  I think he wanted to get a feel for the house before taking it on.  But, you know, he didn't turn me down.  And he's still there, and he's probably one of the most treasured ushers in the house.  So, and there's nothing that would stop any other person of color or cultural background to become a butler.  It's just, you know, those guys don't quit those jobs.  They stay there forever, 30, 35 years in those positions.
Speaker 2: Okay, where the usher is changed periodically--
Speaker 1: Well, actually, the entire staff on an average has been in the White House for twenty years.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Just recently, I attended a retirement of the head storekeeper, supervisor, who retired with the longest serving time in the White House, with fifty years.  You know, to endure, you know, serving, I think it was nine presidents, even more than the, this current movie that's being released soon.  Mr. Hamilton served fifty years in that White House.
Speaker 2: This is an African American?
Speaker 1: African American, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Fifty years.
Speaker 1: That's a long time on anybody's job, particularly when you have long hours.  And he retired looking pretty good, without a cane (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, how old was he when he retired?
Speaker 1: He was in his eighties.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You couldn't tell, tall, slim, not an ounce of fat, you know.  He just, he looked great, looked like he could go for another ten [years].
Story_ID: 626569
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so then what was your typical day like [as the Chief Usher of the White House]?  Now, did you--oh, first thing.  Who did you report to directly?
Speaker 2: Well, when I first interviewed for the job, I would say I was told that I would report directly to the President of the United States.  Well, in essence, that's, wasn't quite the case because he has the weight of the world on his shoulder, not to worry about the house.  So just like in my household, I know who the boss is.  So I reported to the First Lady (laughter).  And, and for other issues like, you know, pay and budget, which I had a budget I had to manage with a special appropriations to the Executive Residence from [U.S.] Congress, I still had to report to the Executive Office of the President on the daily running of the house and the First Lady's chief of staff.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She, the First Lady's office, which includes the social secretary, are the ones that, you know, plan the State dinners.  And so it has to be a team effort.  But they call the shots on here's the food chef, that we want to prepare for the Prime Minister of India or the Queen of England.  And these are the table clothes, Admiral, that we have selected.  And these are the flowers that we want your flower shop to arrange.  So most of the marching orders as far as planning comes from the First Lady's office, (unclear) that it has to be executed by, you know, the chief usher's staff, that it has the people that will actually put that together.
Speaker 1: How large a staff did you have?
Speaker 2: Ninety-five, full-time employees which fluctuates between 90 and 95, 250 part-time butlers, chefs, housekeepers that would come on for large events, anywhere from a State dinner for 300 to an Easter Egg roll for 20,000.  So you needed butler staff to support that.  And in addition to that, I had 22 National Park Service master gardeners and horticulturalists that worked for the park service, but they were assigned to the White House division.  And so there was a relationship that if I needed the golf green to be green, then I would have some direct contact with the park service or like the First Lady's garden, walking around with my superintendent of grounds, which was on my payroll and also the senior person in the White House division for the park service, National Park Service, to help me select the right spot with the right drainage.  I mean it's just, it's amazing the kind of things that you get involved in, picking out swing sets for the girls and new-fangled filtration system for the swimming pool which is now outdoors, changing antiquated things like, instead of dumping gallons or tubs of ice to cool off the swimming pool, you get into technology and modern-day, you know, cooling systems.  Some things didn't change in that house over time.  The lighting system, being a part of saving energy in the White House and making the White House be an example for other federal agencies to follow suit.  We changed 33,000 watts of halogen lighting to light up the four facades of the mansion to 4,300 watts of LED and only using that at 50 percent capacity and slashing the White House energy bill.  So it was more than just food service and butlering, but it's preserving and keeping the House running.  The interesting parts is when you change administration and how do you suit a brand new family.
Speaker 1: And that happened--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And then, it did on my watch.
Story_ID: 626570
Speaker 1: So, yeah, well, tell us about that transition [of presidencies; President George W. Bush to President Barack Obama].  Now, this is, you know, in 2008, Barack Obama is elected President of the United States.  So, January, 2009, I guess--or does it start before that, you know, 'cause the election is in November.  So when do they start making the transition?
Speaker 2: Well, we know there's gonna be a new president.  We don't know who it's gonna be.  But there are preparations, you know, a year out to make sure that at least the structure--you're not gonna have a new president come in and you have mortar falling out of limestone from the facades of the [White] House or floors that have been used constantly.  You know, whatever president's gonna come, you know, you need to have that looking like the most historic house in the country should look, as perfect as possible.  So you try to plan as much as you can upfront, but you can't plan what the likes and dislikes are of the new president and his first family.  So you actually have to wait for that portion to know what wallpaper does the new First Lady like?  You don't know that.  What furnishings do they like?  You have no clue.
Speaker 1: Now, from what I understand from--and this is, I understand this from Jackie Kennedy's tour of the White House when I was a kid watching this on television--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that parts of the White House are historical and can't really be changed, right.  There's a Blue Room, there's a--
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: --Red Room, Green Room, and Oval Office.  I don't know.  To what extent does choice or personality of the president and the president's family affect the way the White House looks?
Speaker 2: You're correct.  The State floor and the ground floor are considered public floors.  And there's a lot of history on those floors, from a bust of various presidents to historic paintings, the Lincoln painting.  You don't want a president or First Lady to come in and take down something that the public has enjoyed for years and they are accustomed to seeing the Lincoln portrait in the State dining room.  Everybody knows that.  It's in books.  It's on video, and so those things are protected by the preservation, Society of Preservation of the White House, and the White House Historical Association.  And it's almost like a board of directors, from curators and historians, from the outside.  And so if a First Lady wants to change the Blue Room into the Orange Room, it has to go through this committee.  And that committee would never allow the Blue Room to change.  So it prevents them from changing the ground floor historically and the State floor.  But they can do anything, within reason, to the second and third floors, which are the private quarters for the First Family and their guests on the third floor.  The Lincoln bedroom is maybe one of the exceptions that, you can change the Queen's room, but the Lincoln bedroom has the Lincoln bed and the Lincoln desk and the original "Gettysburg Address" that was hand penned by President Lincoln.  Those things, you know, we--they don't want a new family to change.  But everything else, if we need to take out a wall, although it may be part of the historical building, that Truman [President Harry Truman] renovated, if it's to suit the first family for some reason, then I can cut out a wall on the second floor.  In fact, I did that for the Obamas before they moved in.
Story_ID: 626571
Speaker 1: So upfront, once you know who the president-elect is, you've already done a lot of legwork upfront by creating a list of questions to ask, all the way down to what type of shampoo do you like and what's the shaving cream.  What allergies do you family--does your family have?  The colors and all those sort of things, the foods that you like and, so you send the questionnaire to the new staff that's already been put together to help us get ready for a new first family, including the moving company you're gonna be using from Chicago [Illinois], and setting up one moving truck to offload the outgoing president on one side of the South grounds and having the incoming moving truck, loaded with the new president-elect to come into the house.  And you may have heard from other documentaries, it takes a good four and a half hours.  That's all we have between the time both presidents leave the mansion, the Executive Residence, to go to the inauguration, from the time the brand new president comes back after the inauguration, after the Congressional lunch, after the parade.  That's about a four hour, four and a half hour timeframe to completely pack up--which we try to pack ahead of time, but to pack up the outgoing president.  Mrs. Bush was really, really organized.  She had everything pretty much ready to go and in boxes, except for the things they were gonna use for those last couple of nights.  But you can't move that stuff because it's still their house, until they leave for the inauguration.  And so this other truck is staged and waiting to go.  You can load some things on the ground floor and maybe put it in the China room but close the door 'cause you're not, you don't wanna give the impression you're trying to kick the other person out.  And, but the moment they walk out of that North portico entrance, a hundred people swarm into the residence, carpets are rolled up, furniture is moved out, boxes are moved out.  The first order of business, take care of the outgoing president, load everything up in the truck, and get that cleared out.  And then start rolling up carpet, doing general cleaning in four and a half hours.  You can't go cleaning carpet when someone's living in it.  Well, at least you can, but not in the White House.  And so that general cleaning doesn't start, and so you have to have things very organized, each floor, you know, I had someone assigned in charge of the State floor, the ground floor, the second floor, third floor, different areas.  They had their job all laid out and what they had to do.  Paintings, and then you have the interior designer that's hired by the new First Lady, and they have to come in and put in new art that matches the taste of the new president.  Out goes certain pieces and in comes loan art from various museums.  It's like organized chaos.
Speaker 2: It's a military operation, almost in a sense.  I mean--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --there's no enemy, but there's a, it's a deployment of--(simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's exciting, and people are charged about their jobs.  They're pumped up because they wanna impress the new first family they're gonna be working for, for the next four to eight years.
Story_ID: 626572
Speaker 1: So when, say in this case, [President] Barack Obama, comes back from the inauguration, you know, which he enjoyed a happy inauguration, nice parade, a lot of people.  The place, [Washington] D.C. [District of Columbia] was flooded with people, when he comes back into the White House and goes up to that second floor, it's all ready for him? (laughter)
Speaker 2: It's all ready for him.  Well, the first order of business is he comes from the parade, but he has to go back out to the reviewing stands.  But they wanna come in and refresh, and get freshed up.  But it's his house now.  It's his house, and Mrs. Obama.  And the chief usher has the honor of opening the South portico doors, and saying, "Welcome, home, Mr. President" and to take them up.  And when they get up to their quarters, their clothes are laid out by the valet, the suit, the right suit to put on, to change into, their toothbrush and their brand of toothpaste and deodorant is already set on the counter.  All of their clothes are perfectly folded into the dressers, and all the clothes are hung up in the closets as if they had been living there already.
Speaker 1: Okay, and I know you mentioned wallpaper.  I keep, my mind keeps flowing back to, do you all wallpaper in this period of time?
Speaker 2: We can't do that in four hours.  Wallpaper doesn't dry that quickly (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, I didn't think so.
Speaker 2: So there is a period that we have to beg the first family, you know, try out Camp David for a little while and have a little vacation (laughter) 'cause the interior the designer is gonna be in here, the decorator, and we're gonna--now, Mrs. Obama, we're gonna put up the wallpaper that you've selected.  And we're gonna bring in certain things that we couldn't do before.  The Oval Office carpet has to be changed out from the old president to the new president.  So there's a lot of moving parts.
Speaker 1: Okay, so now, I've read that you are the first one to greet the President, well, other than Mrs. Obama, I guess.  You're the first person he sees when he starts his day.
Speaker 2: Well, on the ground floor, before he starts his day.  But the butlers, you know, naturally, are gonna bring them coffee or tea in the morning, make sure that they have--there's a different schedule with different presidents.  Some will work out early in the morning, some will--we figure out the times ahead of time to know when they like to be awakened.  Sometimes, it's done by another entity, the White House operator will call at a certain time.  But the butler is usually the first to greet them with whatever they've asked for as a bottle of water or a cup of coffee.  But when he comes down on that elevator, and he's all dressed up and ready to go to work, I'm the first one to say, "Good morning, Mr. President," and to walk him to the Oval Office.
Story_ID: 626573
Speaker 1: Now, what is your typical day like?  I know you, I suppose you have to cover the grounds, cover the inside of the house.  What do you typically do in a day--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Of course, there is no typical day in the house 'cause you, the day before you want to know what's gonna happen when you walk in that door.  So you know about a State dinner or you know, but let's just say there's no event, and it's a normal day as it can be.  The first thing that I would do would, to go in, and, of course, go in my office, but immediately go down and get a briefing from the duty usher, find out what happened overnight.  Were there any issues, were there any special requests?  Is there a late schedule coming from the Oval Office of a new guest coming or whatever, and to find out, you know, here's the lay of the land.  And then once I'm, I get that briefing, then I like--I can't remember who coined this phrase, but MBWA, "Management by walking around."  And so my style was to go through just about every department and check on the butlers, walk through and see if there's any issues in housekeeping, pay a visit--I enjoyed paying a visit to the flower shop, and checking with Mr. Hamilton and the stores, making sure we're stocked, checking in with the ground floor staff of the housekeeping, and walking the grounds with the grounds superintendent just to make sure that we didn't have any brown grass issues or whatever.  A couple of times, you don't always get that opportunity to have a typical day.  And it may be a hot summer, and the fountain turns green, and you're not aware of it.  And it happens to be a day that impromptu the president is taking a stroll around the grounds with the Prime Minister of England, and you have a green fountain because the plumber is in the process of changing things out 'cause it grew algae over the weekend, (laughter) and it's a big embarrassment.  So walking around was really important for me 'cause you tried your best to catch as much as you could.  And sometimes you didn't.  The person that was pretty quick-witted, and, you know, the Prime Minister noticed the green fountain, and he says, well, you know, Mr. Prime Minister, you know, we did this for you since, you know, part of your regime is Ireland (laughter).  So, but it doesn't make you feel too good when you get a report and says, "Admiral, what happened to that fountain this morning?"  So it, you really have to pay attention.  There's a lot of moving parts, and there's always something going on.  And then, of course, you've gotta cater to the other staffs, the First Lady's staff, and the West Wing staff.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 626574
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about the swing set.  I think that was one of the--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: --highlights of (laughter)--
Speaker 2: You know, other than picking out the annual Christmas tree, which was a lot of fun, trying to find out what would make these two beautiful, wonderful, little girls happy in a confined environment, a fishbowl.  And so knowing their ages, first I addressed the bicycle issue.  We were able to get 'em, you know, great bicycles.  And, of course, one of their visits, right after he [Barack Obama] became president-elect, they wanted to see the bowling alley.  So you find out their shoe sizes, and you get bowling shoes ready for the first day to use.  But the swing set, there's a warehouse in an undisclosed location that has all the past equipment, exercise equipment, swing sets from past presidents.  We even house the [President John F.] Kennedy kids' swing set.  And you imagine, it's kinda outdated, you know, old metal, probably a little rusty and it doesn't fit the size of kids that, you know, are tall, first daughter.  So you start searching around and saying, well, what's the best quality swing set I can get to make them happy.  And I did find out from a source--in fact, it was one of the press ladies, April Ryan, who says, I bought Rainbow Play Systems, one of the most popular swing sets in the country out of South Dakota.  And I said, okay, so I did my little homework, and they sent me all kinds of brochures.  And so I flew out to South Dakota because it was just that important, out of 138 choices, to get the right size so they can grow into it.  I selected a great set.  The only problem with that is I, one of my walks with the president from the Oval Office, I mean from the elevator in the residence to the Oval Office, is I mentioned to him that I went out and got this swing set.  And I says, it's top of the line, sir.  And I says, I think they're gonna be really pleased.  And I says, I even tried it out, and I went down the sliding board in South Dakota.  The next day he gets on national TV and tells people about my job and picking out this swing set, and he says, oh, yeah, by the way, the Admiral even went down the sliding board.  And I said, Mr. President, why did you have to put (laughter) on national TV?  Now, my friends know that this sixty-year old man is (laughter) going down a sliding board.  So, but it was fun.  The Rainbow Systems, of course, wanted to do this personally, and the owner came out with his staff and erected this set.  And it was a big hit.  So, it was, it's things like that, that were the fun part of the job actually.  The basketball court was another one.  As you know, the president loves basketball.
Speaker 1: Right, that's right.
Speaker 2: And we had this little half court that was back by the shed of the National Park Service.  But the president is quite good at basketball, and he wanted, you know, top drawer.  So we were able to restripe the tennis court, white lines for tennis, yellow lines for basketball, with able to collapse the tennis nets.  Spaulding came in and gave us some NBA [National Basketball Association] quality basketball hoops, and everyday--he knew it was going on.  He says, Admiral, how's my hoops coming?  And I said, we're almost there, Mr. President, got some issues.  What kind of issues?  Well, you know, we got some, you know, gift issues and all that.  We gotta work with the attorneys.  Admiral, this is not complicated.  And I says, you're right, Mr. President.  It's not.  But truthful as it was, very complicated 'cause you didn't want any embarrassment of funds not being handled the right way and gifts.  He just, he was dying to get on that court.  And I held back letting him know that the folks were erecting it up that day, and he says, "Admiral, how's my hoops?"  I said, "Mr. President, they'll be ready at 11:30 AM."  At eleven o'clock, he was out there popping strings, consistently (laughter).
Story_ID: 626575
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now, you're not concerned with security issues, but you work with NSA [National Security Agency], right, in terms of keeping or at least making sure the president--
Speaker 2: At the White House?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No, I only worked with Secret Service.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, not with the NSA--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --'cause that's more of the intelligence--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Secret Service does direct security with the White House.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And we had a great relationship because we knew we both had a job to do, and so how do we make adjustments to make everything smooth for the president and a very professional group of people.  And actually, it was a joy to work with that organization.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 626576
Speaker 1: Any--now, what's your favorite story from being the chief usher at the White House?
Speaker 2: A favorite story?  I really have to pick and choose because there may be a few.  One that really stands out, yeah, was the Queen of England's visit, her state, official State visit.  And the reason why it stands out is because that was my very first major event.  The White House wanted me to report for duty before I was retired from the [U.S.] Coast Guard because they wanted me to be there for probably the most formal, most important event that probably I would experience in my four years.  So I was there, I got there in March of 2007.  And the Queen [Elizabeth II], I believe her visit was in May of 2007.  So I had to be a quick study and rely a lot on the seasoned staff, my deputy, in particular, who had been there for twenty years.  And so, but I enjoyed, I enjoy creating operation orders and plans 'cause I've been doing that all of my life and making sure every detail is spelled out.  Some people maybe can do it without that, but even when I travel now, on personal travel, I have a list, a checklist from turning out the lights in the house to turning off the electricity to whatever.  So I enjoy, you know, really, you know, making sure everyone understands what has to be done.  Well, it turned out really well.  The State dinner was a resounding success.  And while the Queen was there, she was so impressed with the treatment and the red carpet that we laid out for her that she wanted to meet me and some of my senior staff, a handful of the senior staff, the executive chef, pastry chef, maitre 'd, my deputy, myself.  And I think we may have had the curator there or whatever.  But she came and shook our hands, which was quite memorable.  And she was so impressed that when she got back, my counterpart, the Master of the Household, sent an invitation for us to fly to Buckingham Palace to see how the Brits did their job 'cause they have been doing it for 400 years.  And we took her up on her offer, and met her, which was a, just a tremendous experience being at a black tie event in Buckingham Palace and having the Queen [of England] come up to you and greet you and recall, you know, how you treated her.
Story_ID: 626577
Speaker 1: But the story that, if you don't mind, I'd like to share that I thought was pretty significant was when the Pope Benedict came to visit [the White House] for his State visit.  I was told, and I'll be able to show you a photo where I was told that for this particular visit, I was not allowed in the Blue Room.  And every head of state in every State visit, I'm always the one [as the chief usher of the White House] to walk them in from the South grounds, bring 'em into the Blue Room and have them sign the president's guest book, with the presidential pen.  But I was told, for some odd reason, I couldn't do it this time.  We want you out of the room.  Only the family can be in the room.  And I says, but out of any Head of State, you know, being raised as a Catholic, I wanna be able to say that I assisted the Holy Father, and he says, Sorry, Admiral, you can't be a part of this.  And so they didn't realize the day of the event that I'm the only one that knows how to open that door.  Now, it's a very secure door, and it requires a special key, and only the usher's office has that key.  So he says, okay, fine.  You can go in, enough time to open the door, and then leave the room.  Well, the president's photographer, Aaron Draper, says Admiral, I'm gonna get a photo of you some kind of way with the Holy Father, and he caught me in this photo that I'll share with you as I was leaving the room.  I was right behind the Holy Father.  And so Christmas Eve came, and the Ambassador from Rome, the Papal Nuncio came to visit Christmas Eve for a short tour.  And I was introduced to him, and I says, "Your Eminence, I have a little favor to ask of you.  And I says, because I wasn't allowed to be in the room with the Holy Father on his State visit, that pen that I normally give to the Head of State's assistant was not given to him because they had already left."  I says, I kept that pen because I didn't want someone to sell it on Craigslist.  And I says, how do I get this pen back to the Holy Father?  And he says, write a letter to the Pope.  And I want you to tell the story you just told me and include the pen, and I will guarantee you it'll get to the Holy Father.  A few weeks later, I get a blessed rosary from the Pope.  So, honesty, is a virtue in my book because no one would have known that I could have had that pen and kept it for my own selection--my own collection.  But you just--I can't do that.  It didn't belong to me, plus, I worried about a lightening bolt coming (laughter) down, stealing the Pope's pen.
Speaker 2: I think the sky would be filled with those bolts.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 626578
Speaker 1: What did you notice, was there any difference in style that you noticed between the Obamas [President Barack Obama and his family] and the Bushes [President George W. Bush and his family]?
Speaker 2: Well, they did things differently as far as time.  You know, President Obama, you know, both presidents were very physically fit, and they both enjoyed their morning workouts in the private quarters that we had completely outfitted with the equipment of their choice.  But the timing was a little different.  So their style was the President Bush would get up, you know, really early in the morning, and head straight for the fitness center in his quarters.  Thanks to President Obama, I was able to get another hour of sleep 'cause he got up just as early, but not just hitting the fitness center, but he wanted to have a little quiet time with his girls before he went to work.  So he gave me an extra hour to get to work, which was a good thing.  But styles are different not just with the first families and the president, but their administrations.  And whenever I think you have a new group come in, they're on a learning curve also on what's the schedule, what could be done, what can't be done.  And so you have to spend a lot of time upfront with a new administration, particularly, in their social office to say, okay, you can have a big Halloween party here with Johnny Depp and all dressed up in witches and goblins and all that, but I'm not gonna allow you to put nails in the Truman Column.  And sometimes they don't understand that, says, well, I have to have this prop up there.  I says, then we'll come up with a way for you to erect a prop without destroying a historic column.  So, you know, you have those kind of conversations to try to find a way to make it work, but naturally, there're other styles, and I'm sort of hesitating in talking about all of them because one of the things in that house, the staff tends not to, you know, talk about the real personal changes--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I can share one that I thought was pretty significant, when the younger set Obama family was coming, we were not wired for the Internet in the rooms.  The girls wouldn't be able to do homework 'cause there was no Internet connections.  And so it was a new thing, and we knew this upfront because of the questionnaire and the likes and dislikes.  And it took quite a bit to go into historic stone and ceilings and everything to rewire the entire second and third floor because even Mrs. Robinson, the first mother, was pretty good on a laptop.  And so we had to go high tech when the new family moved in.
Speaker 1: And that's incredible to me.  I don't know how, I think by 2008, I thought everybody, you know, who--we had the kind of means that say the Bushes had, would have the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but you have a staff that, you know, was so used to doing everything for them.  And when they started eight years ago, you know, they weren't playing with laptops and computers and iPhones and that sort of thing.  So you had to adjust to the 21st Century with a young family.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.
Story_ID: 626579
Speaker 1: In terms of family, now, how does your family feel?  I know your mother [Ursula Bernice Carrere] was a force in your family.  How did she feel about you working at the White House?
Speaker 2: Oh, you know, at this--she still thinks I'm still there, and she takes these old pictures and my business cards and takes 'em to the senior center every day.  She is, she was beside herself that her son would run the mansion for the President of the United States.  So if you talk to her today, she'd still be bragging, "My son is the chief usher in the White House."  (Laughter).  And my wife was pretty excited.  Luckily, being a [U.S.] Coast Guard civilian employee for as many years as I was in the Coast Guard, she knows how to cope with long hours.  And so that was never an issue.  I had a job to do.  She knew it was an important job, and if I came in at midnight, she knew exactly where I was, and, you know, we dealt with it.  And we, I tried to include her in as many events as I was allowed to do.  And often, I was asked to bring your wife to this event.  So it worked out well, but the family, my kids, you know, my friends, everybody was kind of--they still sort of brag and say, oh, former chief usher of the White House (laughter).  So I'm old hat now.  (laughter)
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know you have some pictures of your mother in the kitchen with the chef--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --you know, trying recipes, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, teaching an executive pastry chef how to make a New Orleans [Louisiana] rum cake (laughter).
Story_ID: 626580
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were in the White House [as the chief usher of the White House] until 2011, right?
Speaker 2: 2011.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: July 1st, 2011.
Speaker 1: All right, and what made you decide that was the time to go?
Speaker 2: Well, I certainly realized my mother's health situation, although I think I was able to hang on just a bit longer.  They offered me an opportunity.  You know, retiring from the Coast Guard as a rear admiral, and then, going to the White House as chief usher.  And I never turned down a challenge, and so I was offered the top level in the Senior Executive Service at Customs and Boarder Protection, in a brand new position that was created a year before I was due to leave.  But they didn't have the person that they wanted in that position.  So I became their chief strategy officer for the U.S. Customs to try to bring that, sort of another stovepipe organization that was created and put together after 9/11 [September 11, 2001; terrorist attacks], but I stayed there for a year.  It allowed me to get my civilian retirement, but my mother's situation had really decreased a bit.  And giving forty years to the federal government, I thought I'd, I served my country, and now it was time to give more time to my family.  Although my wife understood my hours, I wanted more time.  You know, getting on 395 [interstate] at, you know, six [o'clock] in the morning, it's a good thing not to do that anymore and to be on my own time.  And I think it was time just to have someone, a fresh, you know, perspective on the house.  I've been so used to, in the military, to being moved every two and three years.  I've had twenty tours of duty in thirty-six years.  And it seemed like every time I went into another job, I was able to add another perspective to it.  And I hope my successor is doing the same, adding another dimension.  She has experience from the Ritz Carlton in being a general manager there.  So I think there's always room for someone to even have a different way of approaching the job.
Speaker 1: It's interesting 'cause you said that you were the first military person they'd installed, I guess in that position, and now here's someone who has corporate experience with the Ritz-Carlton to come--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And there's two different presidents.  You know, President [George W.] Bush felt that military experience is what he wanted.  President [Barack] Obama, you know, didn't follow suit and say, let's find another general or an admiral, although my counterpart at Buckingham Palace is a three-star general.  So, but it worked out for the better.  I am, I've served my time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And now, I can move on to my passion that I've been working on for a lot of years now, in completing my research on the book that I'm trying to write.
Story_ID: 626581
Speaker 1: Now, what's your subject for, what's the subject matter for your book?
Speaker 2: The book is something I stumbled--the subject matter is something that I stumbled upon back in 1988 when I was asked to speak--I think I mentioned, to the Black History Month Ball, but although I came across Alex Haley and Black Maria, and a few other notable people, even Captain Mike Healy who people didn't know was African American, because his mother was a mulatto and his father was white.  And he was one of the most well-known skippers of a revenue cutter in the service.  I mean he ruled the Alaskan waters.  You know, he was the one that brought reindeer over to the natives in Alaska to help them survive on a Coast--on a revenue cutter.  And so I came across these.  But the ones that captivated me the most was a photo of seven African American gentlemen, who served at a station in North Carolina on the Outer Banks called Pea Island, P-E-A Island.  And that station had gained a very bad reputation before these black surfmen were assigned there.  The white surfmen were leaving their station to go hunt and fish while ships were sinking, and people were drowning.  So they were shirking their duties.  And it gave such a bad reputation on the U.S. lifesaving service that the superintendent asked Inspector Shumaker to come and investigate why was this happening.  And to go through it briefly, he did an investigation.  He found serious fault with the keeper of that station, George Daniels.  He fired Daniels.  He fired the other senior surfman, and there were two black cooks that he wanted to stay.  And the station, the U.S. Life Service, service, started employing two or three blacks at the stations as cooks.  So they became known as checkerboard crews, black and white pieces.  And so there was a checkerboard crew at Pea Island.  But after he fired all of those folks, he heard about this former slave at the Body Island Station who was the most junior man on the roster, but he was always out with the surfmen, the other surfmen performing rescue after rescue.  And he got this reputation of being the best on the North Carolina coast.  So this guy Schumaker (ph.), which I, that's another chapter that I added within the last week, to try to find out who he was because he took a bold step to recommend to the superintendent that this was the man for the job, professional, intelligent.  His slave owner taught him how to read and white.  His slave owner was his father.  And so Etheridge was the best, and he took a bold step, during the 1800s, 1880, to create an all-black life-saving station.
Story_ID: 626582
Speaker 1: And so I've been researching this for a good twenty plus years.  I've been speaking, I've been published in magazines, but these jobs that I've had, these high-powered jobs, the [U.S.] Coast Guard and the White House and [U.S.] Customs and Boarder Protection, I, I've put my all into whatever I did.  But I didn't have time to finish this.  And it wasn't just about the history, but it was more so about the legacy that they left their descendants and what they left the rest of the folks in the Coast Guard who knew about 'em and people outside the Coast Guard that were involved in this.  I located the white family that they rescued, the most famous rescue.  And posthumously, I was able to give the Coast Guard, to get them to give them the life--gold lifesaving medal.  Up to that point, they had never been recognized for any of their 300-plus rescues.  They went all those years, between 1880 and 1947, and never got one medal.  So I've--they've been a part of me.  I've learned from what these gentlemen have passed, and so I'm writing more, a little bit about the story, but more so about what they left the rest of us.  And there's a lot of folks that are interested in me completing the book.  I'm about a third of the way through now.
Speaker 2: The man that established their tradition was Etheridge, what's the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Richard Etheridge.
Speaker 2: Richard Etheridge.
Speaker 1: He was the former slave.  He actually was more than just a fisherman on the Outer Banks.  He and other blacks, along the coast, joined the Union Army as a condition to free themselves from slavery.  So he fought in the [American] Civil War, and he made sergeant.  He was a commissary sergeant.  And he took a bold move because he was upset at the way the Union Army had broken their promises to the lifesavers' families at home.  They weren't being fed.  They weren't being taken care of.  They weren't getting pay on time.  So he wasn't just fighting the Confederate Army.  He was fitting within the Union Army, and he took a bold step and wrote a letter to General Howard, the superintendent of the Freedman's Bureau, who was assigned to taking care of all the blacks in the Union Army.  And he says, he protested how the black soldiers and the families were being treated.  And he signed his letter "In behalf of humanity."  And so there's so many different facets to this that, that people don't know about this piece of unknown history that I need to get it out.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I need to share it with the world.
Story_ID: 626583
Speaker 1: Now, what other volunteer activities have you engaged in, I know since you have a little bit more time to do--
Speaker 2: (Laughter)--
Speaker 1: --that sort of work now.
Speaker 2: Well, I do a lot of pro bono speaking.  Like my mentor, Alex Haley, he never took a dime from the [U.S.] Coast Guard to speak.  And so I do that quite a bit and doing the movie consulting which wasn't totally volunteer, but the pay was low enough that it would probably be considered volunteer.
Speaker 1: So this is for a movie called 'The But-'
Speaker 2: 'The Butler'--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --'Lee Daniels' The Butler'.
Speaker 1: 'Lee Daniels' The Butler', now, 'cause I know they had a--
Speaker 2: It's a technical thing.
Speaker 1: --lawsuit around the name, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so, 'Lee Daniels, the Butler' which is to be released this Friday, I believe.
Speaker 2: August 16th.
Speaker 1: August, okay, next Friday.
Speaker 2: Or was that a Monday?
Speaker 1: I assume within the next week, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, August 16th is release date.
Speaker 1: It's the 8th now, so almost within a week from when we're talking about it here.  So what is that movie about and what was your consultation to the movie producers?
Speaker 2: The movie came about based on a 'Washington Post' article in 2008 written by Wil Haygood, a superb writer, and his (unclear) line where he found a butler who once served eight presidents, and he wanted to tell his story.  And this butler served loyally for all those years.  He retired and part of the article was about the wife of the butler who died the day before the election for the new president.  But that day of the election, the very next day after she died, Eugene Allen, who is the real butler, went to the polls and voted for the first African American president.  So Wil did a wonderful job in telling about his time working at the White House.  And then Danny Strong, a screenwriter, a well-known screenwriter, read that article and wrote a script.  And then Ziskin, Laura Ziskin, the producer, was captivated by this story of this butler and how well he served.  Ziskin died a year before the set, before making the movie.  So her assistant took up the banner.  And so Pam Williams is the major producer, and then they found Lee Daniels, the director of 'Precious'.  And so they found, they picked a star-studded cast, Forest Whitaker, Oprah Winfrey, Terrance Howard, Cuba Gooding, Jr., Robin Williams, Oprah, just--Lee Shriver, playing presidents, and it's just a fascinating story.  But it did a great spin-off.  And it took this screenwriter, Danny Strong, to say, you know, I can tell about this butler's life.  But the public needs to know maybe what was going on outside of the White House, while he was serving a president or eight presidents inside.  And it happened to be during the Civil Rights Movement.  So much of the movie is not just based on what happened in his service in the House, but during Kennedy [President John F. Kennedy] and Johnson [President Lyndon B. Johnson], and Nixon [President Richard Nixon] and Reagan [President Ronald Reagan], what was happening outside?  So they created a fictitious son, but the story of the Civil Rights Movement was very real.  Now, he did have a son, but they had to create a son who was involved heavily in the Civil Rights Movement.  So it goes back and forth between the butler and the butler hearing what the presidents feel about what's going on in the country and many people don't know that, you know, President Kennedy, who was most idolized for the Civil Rights Movement, President Johnson, who signed the Civil Rights Legislation was not necessarily in favor of civil rights.  But it took the Movement to open their eyes.  And so it encompasses all of that.  It shows the Freedom Bus rides and hosing and dogs biting folks and, and Dr. [Martin Luther] King.  So great movie.  I, the acting is superb.
Story_ID: 626584
Speaker 1: Yeah, you were telling some outtake stories of the (laughter) questions that people had about LBJ [Lyndon B. Johnson] and other presidents?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was an interesting capture of, it may have been fictional to a degree on what was happening with a son that was heavily involved in the Civil Rights Movement, but he really wasn't in real life.  But it did a nice spin-off to educate people on what was happening during that period.  For them to hear and see on the set, President Johnson with the staff right outside of his bathroom door, and he's yelling and cussing at them to get things done, and he's doing it from the toilet seat was interesting.  And I asked the screenwriter today, and I says, I says, you know, that was kind of strange to see that on screen, and even my wife says, why did they have to show the man on the toilet.  I said, did he really sit on the toilet.  He says, not only did he sit on the toilet giving orders, but he had them inside the toilet room while he was doing it (laughter).  And that's the sort of flamboyant individual that this president was.  And so he did do enough research to find out.  Some of the other things in the movie, I thought was interesting.  I tried my best to keep them as accurate as possible, and that's why I was brought on as a White House consultant.  And for the most part, it looked extremely authentic.  Everything was filmed in New Orleans [Louisiana].  They used the old Custom House, and they had these huge marble columns that looked very, very close to what the White House columns look like that was erected by President [Harry S.] Truman.  The staircase was going in a different direction, coming down from the second floor as the president and the head of state normally does, just before a State dinner.  And they says, Admiral, we are not gonna tear down historic stairs just for you (laughter).  So I had to give in on that one, but, you know, overall, the only folks that might criticize a painting or whatever would be someone that's been working there for twenty-five years.  But it looked very, very authentic.  So not only that, but I found myself being as the only White House consultant there even getting into other areas that I had to bow out a little bit, like Secret Service.  They don't like you talking about what they do, and so I said, this one's on you.  I'm not gonna be the one to say, here's where they are.  Here's where they're stationed.  But the staff was very open.  I think Lee Daniels is a genius, and a real artist, although at some times, he says, Admiral, you're killing me.  We can't be that perfect and accurate, but they came pretty daggone close.

Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point in life, is there any major thing you would do differently, if you could go back and change something?
Speaker 2: You know, I've, probably have done and been involved in more things than maybe most people can think of.  So I don't regret what I've done.  The good Lord is not done with me yet.  I know there's something else that is out there waiting for me, and, yeah, I think everyone, if you don't have a self reflection on, could you have done something differently or better, would not be honest with themselves.  Would I have worked harder to get better grades in my first two years of college?  Yes.  Enough to, for me to finish college in the full four years.  But having that break probably helped me out because it changed from maybe finishing in pharmacy that I would not have enjoyed to finishing in another field.  I think everybody would say, how can I be just as rich as Bill Gates.  And I still don't have that answer yet.  So I don't know what I would do differently there, but, yeah, you think back.  And I've had a really great career in the military, and a tremendous opportunity at the White House.  But if you wanna pass on something, if I wanted to pass on something to my kids, it would be the value, you know, of the importance of education.  It's a starting block.  It's not the only answer.  We know there are degrees out there, people with degrees that don't have the opportunities, but you've got to start there.
Story_ID: 626586
Speaker 1: Are there greater opportunities in the [U.S.] Coast Guard now than there were when you started?  Is it a lot easier or--
Speaker 2: I, I wouldn't say it's easier.  There's clearly a lot of great opportunities in the Coast Guard.  We are, we've been given I think even larger missions, particularly, since the BP oil spill and now the big drug interdiction mission, and things are more high tech and the younger folks that are coming up now are just the type of people, if they get into those fields, have a tremendous opportunity in the organization because if I start, started, if I start now, frankly, I wouldn't be as equipped to handle the more high-tech world that these kids can do now.  So there's a tremendous opportunity for people, particularly in the STEM programs, the science and technology and engineering and math, which is one of the volunteer things that I do now as part of the Stars and Stripes organization in trying to encourage young, minority kids to get into the STEM programs 'cause I see now, in hindsight, it would have been great had maybe I, maybe even gone in that direction.  But someone will say now, you know, Steve, you can't have everything.  You didn't do so bad.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 626587
Speaker 1: Tell us about The Rochon Group.  You founded that in 2013, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, that was, that's very recent, and I founded that mainly because of a lot of my consulting work that I need to separate my personal from my business ventures.  There are some other opportunities that look like they may be coming open for some serious consulting work, particularly, with the Maritime industry.  I get pretty regular calls asking me to join up.  And so to do that, I wanna make sure I do it in the right way and what other plans I have for The Rochon Group right now, remains to be seen.  But I had to start a business entity to handle the movie consulting and my future consulting with the maritime industry.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so forty years in service is a valuable, makes for a valuable kind of trust of ideas and information, right, for--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I think a lot of people feel that way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, but I still need to get my first thing out the way.  I have not committed to some of these other--some of them seem like some pretty lucrative opportunities.  But if I don't get the book done, I'm gonna feel like I need to answer your question, what would I have done differently, and I wanna answer that in the next year from now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 626588
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: That, that's a good thoughtful question.  And I think folks around my age do have great hope for this country as far as valuing its diversity.  We also see that there are forms of racism that are alive and well.  I think we could just give every day, recent examples, whether it's supremists out Midwest or other things that are, come up every so often that remind you that we're not quite there yet.  There are still injustices.  There are still inequalities in pay and opportunities.  There are still people that are calling up complaining with Cheerios, about a little, beautiful black child on a commercial with mixed parents.  And so I think we're fooling ourselves that we're there.  We still have a little ways to go.  But I am hopeful because when I think back to my days in New Orleans in the '50's [1950s] and the '60's [1960s], we've made a tremendous stride.  I would not have had the job, both as an Admiral or the Chief Usher had we not made gains.  We would not have the first African American president had we not made some strides.  And there are thousands of other examples.  And you have the Oprah's and the Sheila Johnsons of the world that are doing quite, quite well, and Congressmen, and so, yeah, we have done better.  And I'm hopeful we're gonna continue to do that.  But I am concerned about what I see in our youth.  Right now I'm now, how to reach them to tell them, how to reach them to tell them that education is so critical, yet they don't see it.  They don't think that school is important.  We need to work on that.  And we're not there.  Some kind of way we're missing the right tact to tell people, this is what you should be doing now.  Hanging out in the street, and getting into crime--and it's not just amongst the African American community.  But the question is directed to my concerns, and how we do that, we need to find a way.  We all have our little way of doing it.  I'm trying in my own way to mentor as many people as I can physically do.  And I've kept mentors, a couple hundred from my former organization that still call me on a regular basis.  But I'm still concerned about even the younger folks, the folks even younger than my 40-year old son, who seem to think they should be in the in-crowd and be in the street and not respect human life, not respect someone else's property.  It bothers me.  It bothers me and I'm concerned when I see the scores, the thousands, the millions of African Americans incarcerated.  There's, you cannot be happy with that sort of situation, whether it is self-inflicted or whether it's the system, there's a concern.  So, but I still remain hopeful that we can get there just based on what we've done up to this point.
Story_ID: 626589
Speaker 1: Okay, once again, if you look back on everything you've done to this point today, what today would you consider to be your professional legacy?
Speaker 2: My professional legacy.  Whatever job I've been in, I've tried to set a high standard, an example of, not just work ethics, but ethical behavior.  Doing and making decisions, leadership decisions, based on, you know, what's the right thing to do and not be distracted on personal gain, and what I can get away with.  And so I'm hoping with that folks can remember that, and the people that have worked with me all of these years, that I've stuck pretty true to that, hoping that, that is an example for them to follow.  I'm hoping that I would be remembered, that I made a difference.  And I go back to the "find the good and praise it" phrase that when I did see people do good things, that I recognized that, and I think, for the most part, since it has been a part of me that people will remember me that, you know, that I've recognized folks and I continue to do that.  When they finally put me away, I want them to say that he did make a difference.  And hopefully, in his way, however, small or large, that humanity is a little bit better off.
Story_ID: 626590
Speaker 1: Okay, tell us about your family now.  I know you have a son, I think you have a daughter, two and you told us about how you met your wife, and your mother [Ursula Bernice Carrere] is still with us too, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: I have a wonderful family.  I've been blessed, and they know that they are a joy to me.  Sometimes folks saying, you know, you're too much into family, and every holiday and every birthday, you're in the pots, and you--but that's just the way I grew up.  I have a, my natural son who's 42, and he's an IT recruiter here in Virginia.  I have a older daughter, stepdaughter.  I just don't even like to use that term because I accept them as my own that my wife brought to our union, who is a elementary school teacher and doing extremely well, and married to a school teacher that's doing extremely well, molding young minds.  And another son who is an IT specialist with the federal government and doing quite well, and the youngest of our combined daughter is a specialist with the FDIC.  And in her young age has really climbed to the top of the GS level and doing quite well.  So we're blessed, we're blessed with eight grandchildren and two great grandchildren.  And I have two wonderful brothers, and my wife was born in a family of 10 children.  And, unfortunately, two are no longer with us.  One was killed in Vietnam and the oldest sister is deceased.  But the rest of them, it's a huge party when we get together on Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's, Easter and birthdays.  I have big pots, imported from New Orleans [Louisiana], gumbo pots, that serve 40, 50 people at a time.  So right now, that's what I live for.  I live for my wife of twenty-two years, and my kids and my grand kids and my dear mother.
Story_ID: 626591
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I have one last question, but is there anything I haven't asked you about that we need to raise before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Not that I know.  I think you've covered everything pretty well.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, the last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.  Sir, how would like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: That I've touched a lot of people's lives in a positive way, that hopefully, they feel they're much better off than had I not been involved in their lives.  I would love to be remembered that way.  I would love to be remembered as a devoted family man.  I would love to be remembered as someone who has always taken an interest, even at the sacrifice of myself, to help someone get ahead in life, to help someone succeed.  I thrive in that and to do that.  And I would hope that when someone is giving my eulogy--hopefully, not anytime soon, that they bring those things out, that I always had someone else's interests at heart.
Speaker 1: All right, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thanks, Larry [Crowe; interviewer, The HistoryMakers].

Speaker 1: That picture is Theodile Picou who was the, I'm just trying to think.  Right now, I'm thinking a little bit--Theodile Picou was on my mother's [Ursula Bernice Carrere] side of the family, the Carrere side, C-A-R-R-E-R-E.
