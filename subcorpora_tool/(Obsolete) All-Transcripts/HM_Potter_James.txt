Speaker 2: Full name is James G. Potter, Jr.  J-A-M-E-S, G, Potter, P-O-T-T-E-R, Jr. [HistoryMaker James G. Potter].
Speaker 1: All right.  And what does the G stand for?
Speaker 2: No one has ever been able to tell me.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: It was inherited from my adoptive father [James G. Potter, Sr.].  He never gave me what the G stood for and my mother [Maxine Embry Potter] didn't know.  So I've never known over the course of my life what the G stands for.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Date of birth is eight, one, fifty-seven [August 1, 1957].  Place of birth is actually Muncie, Indiana, but my birth certificate says Richmond, Indiana because I was adopted.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And can you tell us, sir, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Attorney.  I've always been an attorney and I'm currently the general counsel for Del Monte Foods [Inc., San Francisco, California].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is the 17th of September, 2005.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?

Speaker 1: Before we go into depth there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions we always ask, and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Do I have a favorite food?  Actually yes caramel corn (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Fall without a doubt.
Speaker 1: Favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite color, no.  Blue is probably the closest.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Los Cabos [Mexico].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Where is that at, I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: Mexico.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Do I have a favorite phrase or saying?  No, I don't think so. That's all.  If I think of one, I'll give it to you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I don't think so.
Story_ID: 296664
Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family an- and your father's [James G. Potter, Sr.] side.  We'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Okay, well I'll have to distinguish between biological and adoptive mother because I don't know my biological parents.  But my, as far as I'm concerned, my mother's name is Maxine Embry, was her maiden name, Embry.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born February 5, 1926.
Speaker 1: All right.  And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in West Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What do you know about her side of the family?
Speaker 2: What do I know about her side of the family?  One that they came up from West Virginia it seems en-masse to Richmond, Indiana.  It must have been around the '20s [1920s] that they are you know all hard working people, devoted to you know education and to each other.  I think that her generation as far as I could tell was kind of the last generation of that family that really knew each other and kind of lived as friends with each other.  As for--I'm very disconnected from my cousins, et cetera, and I think a lot of people are in my generation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they moved as a group you say en-masse or something?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were--there were eleven in her family.  I think eight girls and three boys and they all somehow ended up in Richmond, Indiana.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right now what were their occupations, what do they do?
Speaker 2: I'm actually one, one generation up from my mother.  They were essentially some were small business owners.  Some worked fire department, railroad, other service industries, moving to--well the aunt who raised my mother was a domestic and then my mother was in--was a librarian actually.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now did your mother talk about growing up in?  Did she grow up in West Virginia or did she--
Speaker 2: No, she, she grew up in Richmond, Indiana, and she did talk a limited bit about it because her parents died when she was very young.  I think at the age of three or four she was taken in by an aunt, Aunt Ethel [Fife], as a matter of fact.  And in those days, people were pretty hard and I think the--your relatives stepped up to the plate if your parents died and they took you in but it was not a cushy existence.
Speaker 1: Now this is the [Great] Depression we're talking about--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --where she grew up?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And coming from the South especially I think African American families you know their whippings were the rule.  Children were to be seen and not heard.  And my Aunt Ethel as far as I knew her was a tough customer in any event.  So my sense of, of mom growing up and as I said she didn't talk a lot about it was--it was pretty tough and that she essentially her cousin, my Uncle Buster [Lawrence Dawkins], who was Aunt Ethel's son, was like a brother to her.  That was the family that she moved into.  Worked you know from the time that she could in various odd jobs you know starting as a domestic.  Was able to get one year of college at Earlham College [Richmond, Indiana] and then moved into the library, Richmond--I'm sorry Morrisson-Reeves Library [Richmond, Indiana] where she was for thirty-seven years before retiring.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she was a librarian--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --for most of her life (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 296665
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's full name is James G. Potter [Sr.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  You realize if we Google James Potter, we get--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that's the name of Harry Potter's father.
Speaker 2: Exactly. Yes, I do realize that.
Speaker 1: When I was doing research we kept running into--I kept running into that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: But so your father is James G. Potter?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And what, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His place of birth is Liberty, Indiana.  He was born November 11, 1921.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well tell us about his side of the family.  Where are they from?  And what did they do?
Speaker 2: They actually--they were--they own sort of originated in Liberty, Indiana, which is thirteen miles from, from Richmond [Indiana].  I think ultimately they you know had migrated up from the South.  I know much less about my father's family.  But his brothers seemed to be universally barbers.  His, his sisters were in a host of businesses, including the restaurant business, and then one sister I believe married--her husband was a major car dealer in Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Major car dealer, okay?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well which one?
Speaker 2: Donnie [ph.].  Donnie P. was his name but I can't remember what the last name was.  It wasn't Potter.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's a big deal.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it is actually.
Story_ID: 296666
Speaker 1: Did your father [James G. Potter, Sr.] talk about growing up?
Speaker 2: My--you know to this day I have a hard time remembering any conversations with my father.  I was basically adopted at five and my parents divorced at--when I was ten and from that time five to ten I think probably was pretty rocky from the time I was seven or eight until the time that they actually divorced.  So it's hard for me to remember any you know conversations with my father.  I have a real--I have a sense that I never knew him as a person.
Speaker 1: Did he remain in contact with the family?
Speaker 2: Not, not really, not really.  I don't know my father's relationship with his father [Beverly Potter] and as I've talked to--gone to the Potter reunion for example and talked to some of his brothers, you know they say that he very much loved his--I have two brothers and a sister.  You know very much loved his, his family but you know just had a hard time either showing it or making it work.  So and perhaps that stems from his--the dynamic with his family but you know he was--in, in those days you can be a construction worker, maybe these days too, but you could be a construction worker, it was seasonal work, it was you know only when it was raining and then he you know he was into gambling and you know and ultimately that's why they were divorced.  It was ultimately why they had to declare bankruptcy and we lost our home, et cetera.  So but I would have--I really wish I would have known him better as a person.  I knew I got my hair cut with--at Uncle Carl's [Carl Potter] or Uncle Gilbert's [Gilbert Potter] or Uncle Harry Potter's barbershop so you know off and on I would talk with my uncles but it was you know it was just generally when I was in the barber's chair.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there a story that was passed down as to how your parents met?
Speaker 2: You know it's kind of interesting that we really because it, it was I think it got sort of tough after, after we were introduced to the family and we saw them kind of argue a lot, we never got a lot of good times 'cause there must have been good times 'cause they were divorced after nineteen years but I think back in those days they went to their roller rinks and they had you know just parties and they either met, I'm not quite sure which one it was, it was either a roller rink or a skating night or whatever they call it or at a party--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and just sort of developed it from there.
Story_ID: 296667
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Maxine Embry Potter] ever discuss with you--or your father [James G. Potter, Sr.]--their decision to adopt a child?  It would seem like a special thing to me, that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I know they, they and that was exactly what they wanted to do.  They wanted to adopt one child and I can't remember which--I think it perhaps was my father was the reason that they couldn't have children and so they decided to adopt a child.  He wanted a son, obviously with that name, he wanted a son.  In those days also they had orphanages which you know now I think it's all foster home or foster care system.  So they went to the orphanage in Muncie, Indiana, and you know and that--the practice was that you found children who I guess the parents kind of lined up with initially and then you went to their homes et cetera and they--you know they talked to me but then the orphanage informed them that I had two brothers and I also had a sister who'd been adopted by another family that was in the same city, Richmond, Indiana.  So when they made the decision, they said you know we really can't break up the, the brothers and so they adopted all three of us.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so you have a brother and a sister?
Speaker 2: I have two brothers and a sister.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And okay so did that make it easier you know I guess to be you know to--
Speaker 2: I think it did.  I think it made a lot easier to have t- siblings, two brothers growing up and it may have made it tougher on my sister to grow up.  Ultimately she was only two or three blocks away from us growing up with a different family who and everybody knew each other and I was over, I call her Aunt Callie [ph.] and Uncle Russell [ph.], they're both deceased now, but we spent a lot of time over there, great people.  But I think it made it easier for the brothers.  We had built in playmates and you know and I think it perhaps made it a little tougher for my sister and made it you know perhaps a little bit more distance between my brothers and my sister and myself that we tried to bridge as we've gotten to be adults.  But yeah I think it; it made it easier for the brothers.
Story_ID: 296668
Speaker 1: Now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: An earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 1: Right, or h- how old were you when you were adopted number one?
Speaker 2: Five.  I was five.  Actually my earliest childhood memories are probably two that, two or three that I play over.  The first is that evidently my mother died of some sort of brain tumor or whatever and the, the only memories I have of my mother is one her serving us uncooked oatmeal just basically the Quaker Oats in milk and with some sugar on it which I continue to eat I think until I was like fifteen just because of, of the memories and the second is her you know her essentially bent over the, over the toilet throwing up and that must have been part of, part of her tumor.  So I have that memory.  I have a memory of some sort of gang fight going on outside of--in the, in the alley or the next two blocks worth of alleys when I was in Muncie [Indiana] and then I have the memory of being in the nurse--in the orphanage which was just this huge room with beds down either, either sides of the wall and it was a--it seemed to me it must have been a scary place because it was you know uncomfortable going to sleep there at night.  I have those, and then also have memories of the cafeteria and of having hominy which I hate now (laughter).  But you know those sort of things were probably my earliest memories before, before being adopted and going to Richmond [Indiana].
Story_ID: 296669
Speaker 1: Can you describe the neighborhood that you lived in in Richmond [Indiana]?  What was, was there a black side of town in Richmond and a white side?
Speaker 2: There was, there was but we didn't--we lived in what was then solidly middle class because you could be that if you were in construction or if your mother was a librarian or if you had factory job.  Factory jobs at that time paid you know a solid wage and so you could you know live, have a middle class existence.  So we were in a integrated solidly middle class neighborhood when I first went to Richmond.  One block away from the elementary school [Vaile Elementary School, Richmond, Indiana] so it was, and as I said we had a black family on one corner, two white families on opposite corners, we lived on a corner, and there just seemed to be you know at that time an integrated middle class neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So Richmond at that time wasn't a strictly segregated town?
Speaker 2: No, it had, it had that history but you know Richmond's high school [Richmond Senior High School; Richmond High School, Richmond, Indiana] for example was always integrated.  You know the high school was never segregated.  I don't think the school system really was ever segregated, not officially.  Now the north end is where the you know the largest percentage of African American's lived and you know so those schools down there, the elementary I believe and the junior high [Hibbard Junior High School, Richmond, Indiana] you know were largely African American but it wasn't officially segregated and the two ends sort of split south and north ends tended to have the highest percentages of African Americans.  The east and west tended to be the--you know again this is all relative, but the more affluent you know folks in, in Richmond.
Speaker 1: Well Richmond is an interesting town, a long history.  Do you remember hearing anything about the history of the town when you were there?
Speaker 2: You know there were a couple of things that are that sort of flow out of that.  The, the Rose Festival that the town used to have for a while because we grew when Hills' Roses [Richmond, Indiana] was there we grew an awful lot of the roses that were shipped out you know to the rest of the country and to the world.  Glen Miller Park [Richmond, Indiana] where the fireworks are, are every Fourth of July is named for Glenn Miller because he came to town at one point when jazz was--big bands were really big and, and, and played in the town and then I think it's also known for being the--for opening the first junior high, official junior high in the country, which is about two hundred years ago.
Speaker 1: I think there's an Underground Railroad history associated with Richmond too?  (Simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it's kind of interesting because Indiana, I think people generally think of Indiana as, as obvious midwestern but in a lot of its views it's more southern.  And Richmond is a--definitely a country town and you were often growing up there because we had, we had, we had difficulties especially in my years in high school we had difficulties with race relations.  But you're also--often surprised at you know that the abolitionists were because of Earlham College [Richmond, Indiana] and the Underground Railroad and et cetera and those things that were part of its history kind of got lost I think along the way as the town moved into the '70s [1970s] and to some extent, the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it was like part of the national trail--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --which was the major highway through the Midwest was right through Richmond.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 296670
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights and sounds and smells of growing up?  Well, I think the--you know it's like everything else.  I think there is, there were mixed bags of sights and sounds and smells.  I think the--on the one hand, there is the challenge of you know having parents [Maxine Embry Potter and James G. Potter, Sr.] that for a while you know don't get along and you have those sounds.  And my mother's were very stern at least at that time were sort of very stern individual.  But she was also a great cook so we had you know the, the great smells of--she loves to make bread and nothing fills a home with a nicer smell than when someone's baking bread.  So there were--those were, there were those smells and especially around the holidays were very nice.  I was always a kid that got out and you know I liked to ride my bike.  And in Richmond [Indiana] you know you weren't five minutes from being out in the fields and in the forest, et cetera so I spent a lot of time out.  And when I think about you know growing up, I tend to think about you know the walks I would take or the hikes I would take into the neighboring fields and forest et cetera and that's really what I did a lot of and really enjoyed.  So I, I and just the fresh air, the fresh smells, especially very early in the morning when I wasn't hiking, I'd like to get up and run especially very early in the morning.  The sun--I like to see sunrises and sunsets.  So I'd go out of my way to find, find ways to see the sun come up or the sun go down.  We weren't a family that talked a lot.  I mean it wasn't my mother's upbringing and so it wasn't instilled in our, in our family so we, we didn't talk a lot because we didn't have a lot of money, we didn't do--you know we tried--she tried to take us on vacations and often it was to just to a nearby state park you know where again we would do more hiking or fishing or, or that sort of thing.  But you know not to different cities or anything like that to see, more to lakes and to, to that sort of thing, which it resonated very well with me.  I mean I enjoyed that.  We weren't a family that did a lot of yelling.  So we were kind of quiet my brothers and I.  We did crazy things but it wasn't you know, it wasn't a lot of, a lot of noise around the house.  Lot of sports so you know the--when I think of, of growing up I think of you know the contact of basketball and football and to some extent baseball.  But that's, that's pretty much what it was.  It was you know our house was always--it was generally quiet.  Around the holidays had great smells, was always clean.  My mom had a list of chores that we had to do all the time and you know the sights were actually pretty straightforward for you know what you would think of in a small, small country town with easy access to what I like to think of as nature.
Story_ID: 296671
Speaker 1: Who do you think influenced you the most growing up?
Speaker 2: You know as time goes by you have to say it's your mother [Maxine Embry Potter].  I mean who instilled for us a work ethic. For me,  you know I probably had it to begin with a little bit of just a love of learning but having a mother who's a librarian you're naturally gonna have a tremendous access to, access to books and to learning.  You know and she instilled the discipline of politeness, of courtesy, of being thoughtful of others.  To some extent of staying out of the limelight, you know do what you need to do but it's not about you know a lot of public recognition for it.  So I, I would say those very basic things that have actually carried me throughout life and throughout career of, of, of hard work and of thoughtfulness.  But I would also say that you know I spent a lot of time with my Aunt Callie [ph.] who is my sister's adopted mother and Aunt Callie was a great influence because she had patience you know just beyond belief.  Her husband [Potter's Uncle Russell (ph.)] had Alzheimer's for the last ten years of his life and she took care of him rather than putting, putting him in a home.  And even as I've gone to work and talked to people about Aunt Callie and it seems like every department I've been in they understand when an Aunt Callie-ism is because Aunt Callie was the kind of person who would always tell the truth but in interesting, very interesting ways for example someone would work hard to bake a cake for her and bring it over but you take a you know the first bite out of it and it was horrible and so for example then she would have to just throw it out because you couldn't eat it.  And so the person would come back over and you know Aunt Callie would be returning the pan and she would ask the person who had given the cake would say well, well how did you like that cake?  And my Aunt Callie would say something like well you know things like that don't last long around here.  So we have you know and then we convert that to the business my law department manager has a saying that is known as an Aunt Callie-ism if people call us about someone for example who we've terminated for poor performance but they wanna a reference from another company that's calling us.  We may say something like that, something like well nobody would be better in that job or you'll be lucky if you get that person to work for you.  So, that's viewed as a sort of an Aunt Callie-ism but Aunt Callie had--that was her way.  She was just very patient, very thoughtful, never got upset, was just a tremendous influence on me when I was in high school when you're you know you're typically bouncing off the walls.  You get upset about a whole wad of different things.  It was great to have that balance.
Speaker 1: She sounds like quite a whip you know.
Speaker 2: Oh that was thing you know and we tend to lose sight of--unfortunately and the way today's world is we don't have as much contact with our seniors, with elders and we don't get the benefit of what they've gone through and what they've learned and how that's sort of molded them into really wonderful people, a lot of them.  Certainly some people become bitter over the years, but a lot of our senior people are very, very knowledgeable, very patient people and we lose their benefit because you know of our careers and the distances and all those sort of things.  But they can be great influences.
Story_ID: 296672
Speaker 1: We talked about if af- off camera but growing up near Richmond [Indiana], I remember the zoo [Glen Miller Park Zoo, Richmond, Indiana].  Can you talk about the zoo and that lion?  You said that roar could be heard all over town?
Speaker 2: Right, the zoo was I think a lot of people are ambivalent about the, about the zoo in Richmond.  On the one hand, I spent a lot of time out at the park because for a small kid Glen Miller Park [Richmond, Indiana] seemed like a big place.  I mean you really could--felt like you could be wondering in the wilderness but you weren't probably two seconds from you know from being on Main Street but you felt like you were wondering in the wilderness.  And the zoo I think--as I said I think at least I felt ambivalent about because on the one hand it was a place where you could go and see elk.  I mean there's a spot for elk, for deer.  I think at one point they had a rhino in there.  They had not only one lion, but I think two lionesses.  They had rhesus monkeys.  They may even have had an alligator or things you know along those nature.  But we're talking about all of those creatures in probably a two block space and I think initially as a child you're fascinated to see those, see those animals.  But as you see them more and more and actually saw the condition of the animals and you know especially take the lions that were in very small confinements, got virtually no exercise.  But every evening right around the time the sun was going down, the male lion would just stand up and roar and almost when you saw him do it, but it was more like a bellow.  But it was a roar and you know you, you don't realize it but a lion's roar can be heard for miles and so Glen Miller Park was at 22nd [Street] and Main [Street], we lived at 10th [street] and I [Street] essentially and we could hear it you know plain as day you know.  Which is an odd thing to think about.  You know in Richmond, Indiana, a town of forty thousand people you can hear a lion's roar every evening as the sun was setting, but they ultimately I think closed it down for humanitarian reasons.
Story_ID: 296673
Speaker 1: I'm just speaking off camera the housing stock in Richmond [Indiana], that big Victorian houses downtown and this huge you know impressive looking structures and it seemed like it was a lot of history preserved in the town.
Speaker 2: I think that's right and the--well what I noticed about it was that again the way the world has changed but the banks were all downtown and if you actually look at the big you know Tudors and Victorians and Colonials, they're very close to the downtown area.  And the you know the bankers are the other well-to-do folks literally walked just a couple of blocks to, to downtown and the unfortunate thing is that as the world has changed you know the houses are still there but the--they've all you know pretty well been run down as all the now executives are out in, to the extent there are, are out in the suburbs or closer to you know the plants, et cetera out there.  It's kind of, kind of a shame because you can imagine you know kind of what the town was like when it was big homes.
Speaker 1: Looks like a prototypical--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, town near the main street--
Speaker 2: Right. Right.
Speaker 1: --and all that--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --from the old days people say oh the good old days--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --look like this.  Richmond still kind of looks that.
Speaker 2: Right.  And when you go downtown and you look up on some of the buildings they have the dates you know 1876, 1861 you know.  As you get older and then kind of know to look for these things and that they have some meaning you know you start really noticing how old the town is and in some cases well preserved.
Speaker 1: Yeah they said when I was there some years ago; they said it was at one--that they were the richest town in Indiana.
Speaker 2: In Indiana, well it's right on the Whitewater River which used to mean something you know for navigation purposes and then there were foundries, there were a couple foundries that were there for the longest time they were there until the last one burned down maybe ten years ago.
Story_ID: 296674
Speaker 1: And off camera too we asked about the Embrys.  Now the Embrys, your, your your mother's [Maxine Embry Potter] family, they're related to [HistoryMaker] Wayne Embry, the basketball player?
Speaker 2: Right and that's not the only basketball player now that you mention that.  My Uncle Lenny Rhodes who was a cousin to my mother on her, her--her essentially mother was the sister to his, he played in Detroit [Michigan] and he was another one of these huge guys 6'7" you know 250 [pounds] but was the, was a one shot, one hand you know push shot artist which is so fascinating to me.  But they all played with a one handed you know shot and to this day he's actually, actually pretty good at that.
Speaker 1: Is Jalen Rose related to them also (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay because he's from Detroit I know. Okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly.  Exactly.
Story_ID: 296675
Speaker 1: Well let's talk about school now.  Now what grade school did you go to?
Speaker 2: Went to Vaile Elementary School [Richmond, Indiana].
Speaker 1: That's V-A-?
Speaker 2: I-L-E.
Speaker 1: I-L-E, okay.  Well were there many elementary schools in Richmond [Indiana]?
Speaker 2: Oh, there were probably five or six.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And one high school, right?
Speaker 2: One high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So Vaile now was that--so it was an integrated school?
Speaker 2: Vaile was an integrated school.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Sort of reflected the times because I was there in the '60s [1960s] and it kind of reflected the times but it--Richmond was always an integrated (clears throat), integrated school system.
Speaker 1: So I take it from what you said earlier that you, you liked school fairly well and your mother [Maxine Embry Potter] was a help?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I've, I've always liked to read and to learn and, and if there was a challenge at school, I think it may have been along, along the social lines because you invariably even in a school that's integrated you run into, to teachers that have their own issues and they're also very helpful teachers.  You know Vaile at that time, you know corporal punishment was you know in vogue and so you know I got one or two paddlings which you know those are in my opinion that should just never happen you know I was maybe a third grader, a eight year old and the person who did the paddling at Vaile was the gym teacher who's about three hundred pounds and you know hit you with this long paddle and I remember the first time that that had happened literally lifted me off my feet and you know threw me about six feet and all he had to do was one shot but you know that was in my opinion an unfortunate experience.  But overall you know Vaile was I, I--public schools back then I think were, they were pretty strong.  I mean everybody was essentially going to the same school.  There weren't private schools, there were Catholic schools but by in large there weren't private schools and especially in a town that size people were generally committed to the schools and to education.  And other than--I mean you would have you would have teachers who were very supportive and you would have some who, who weren't as supportive for you know kind of reasons of their own.  But by in large you know I think they did a pretty good job you know trying to educate the kids.

Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: It's always been reading you know.  Whether--if it was English, it would typically be it but anything to do with reading would always be my favorite.  Math was something that I have studied hard at and always did well in math but it was never anything that reso- resonated with me until actually I got to college [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] and calculus oddly enough because I had to study calculus so hard to do well in it that it was the first time I ever saw the kind of beauty of math but up until that point math was just something you worked through and, and got through.  I always enjoyed the sciences, but anything to do with reading. English, novels, I'm a great--my preference is non-fiction.  I'll, I'll read about topics like astronomy or anatomy just on my own but anything to do with reading was my favorite right on through school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well you were in a lucky situation with a mother [Maxine Embry Potter] as a librarian (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes oh--
Speaker 1: --right.  I spent a lot of time up at the library [Morrisson-Reeves Library, Richmond, Indiana] and actually that's kind of how it started.  I'd go into just like now I'll go into a book store and I just go into a library and I just see the books and it just--and I'll go up and down the aisles and I just liked that, I liked that environment.  I loved to see books and, and, and I'll pick 'em and I'll, I'll read you know just about anything.  I will read just about anything and I'm interested in just about everything so.
Story_ID: 296677
Speaker 1: I forgot to ask you this when we started, but like what would you think the black population at Richmond [Indiana] was when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, we always thought--
Speaker 1: Percentage wise I guess.
Speaker 2: --we always thought it was larger than it was but at any given time it was when I was growing up no more than three to four percent.
Speaker 1: That is small, that's small.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We always thought it was larger because we all knew each other and interacted with each other but when you really looked at the population numbers, census numbers, it was pretty low.
Speaker 1: So were you the only black student in your class pretty much?
Speaker 2: After you got tracked.  Back in those days you got tracked at the high school level you know general, academic.  And so after, after that happened, I was, I was definitely the only black kid in the classes and prior to that it would just--there would be no more than two but that would be a matter of like I said the percentages and the demographics but in going into high school is where the system kind of operated you know between the races and I'm, I'm sure I was the only black person in my classes.  And all my siblings I believe were tracked general.  And I was the only one that was tracked academic.  But after they got out of high school, both my brothers went to college and did very well at Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana].
Story_ID: 296678
Speaker 1: Did you have favorite teachers in school [Vaile Elementary School, Richmond, Indiana]?
Speaker 2: I did have favorite teachers.  I had a favorite fourth grade teacher Ms. Tishook [ph.] just because she was very supportive, very encouraging when I was in fourth grade so I was about nine and you know I just always remember her as someone who is encouraging me and you know there were--I think I had a project at one point that involved a glass jar and somehow or another as I was going out the, the main door of the school, I managed to drop the glass jar and the glass was everywhere and the principal came out and he was furious and Ms. Tishook came up and said you know, "Don't be upset.  This is Jim Potter [HistoryMaker James G. Potter].  He's a very,"--Jimmy of course--, "Jimmy Potter, he's a very conscientious young man.  I'm sure it was an accident and we'll get this cleaned up."  And I never forgot that because you know the principal was one of these kind of people who would say something like when somebody would call you a nigger he would take you to the dictionary and show you in Spanish you know that nigger was niger or something that meant black and aren't you black?  And you're like you know how you gonna argue with that as as a, as an eight year old or seven year old, but you know it's not right.  And--
Speaker 1: Did that happen to you?
Speaker 2: --oh yeah, that's exactly where the example came from because--
Speaker 1: Tell me now. Man, tell us, tell us this story.  This is really interesting.
Speaker 2: Now interestingly enough I think the, the, the largest challenge is a lot of times that blacks present to whites is that the lower economic levels and so the you know again it was, it was a school where everybody went because there weren't private you know private schools but you tended to have less direct confrontations with the kids who were more affluent, largely because they wouldn't condescend to talk to you I suppose.  But the kids interestingly enough who were poorer than the middle class blacks typically were the ones who you had the most confrontations with and then so I think going between classes you know there was some pushing and shoving between me and another guy who, who actually I got along with most of the time I remember.  But at the end of the day on this day, he called me a nigger and I believe I clocked him and but that led to two things.  That led to me going to the principal's office and having the principal tell me that in point of fact you know if you go to this Spanish derivation of the word nigger it means black and aren't you black and so therefore you weren't justified in hitting him, you weren't justified in becoming upset.  And once he had done that proof, then it was off to the, the gym teachers in the gymnasium and the gym teacher for the paddling.  So those two stories are actually, actually connected so you know in response to being called a nigger and hitting this guy, I get this you know this explanation of what the word means and then get a paddling for hitting the guy.
Story_ID: 296679
Speaker 1: Almost feels like you're being called a nigger again by the principal in so many words (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) See, see the thing is, the thing is I mean as a young person, you don't have the logical ability to kind of walk through plus you're intimidated.  There've been a couple of times in elementary [Vaile Elementary School, Richmond, Indiana] and junior high [Hibbard Junior High School, Richmond, Indiana] where I felt like I could you know pull apart the logic what they were saying to me but you're too intimidated because you're too small and you're too young.  So what he was telling me I knew it was, was not logical and in any event it wasn't on point because the point was the kid was trying to insult me.  He was trying to hurt my feelings and you know and I responded to that and maybe inappropriately, but nonetheless I respond to that.  So if the principal in my opinion had been a mature, decent adult, that's what he would have talked about you know.  That you know your response, your response we understand.  You know the person was trying to offend you, trying to insult you, but in this school you know we handle those things differently than you know hitting each other.  I think that would have been something that I would respected.  Going through this other pseudo logic was just a demonstration of racism actually and then to go get paddled for the whole thing.  It undermines the entire and undermines the principal and it undermines the coach, it undermines the school.  You don't, you don't, you know you don't forget those things.  They kind of set in your mind how some people can use both their position and their intelligence to, to take advantage of, of the weaker actually.
Speaker 1: Well culturally, with black people I mean it's--to call someone a nigger, we both know that it's different from calling them stupid or something like that you know.  But, but tell us like what, what would be the community--what would be the expected response from some- from the black community you know for an individual who's called a nigger?  What would the community expect of your age group or of a black male if you called him a nigger?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I think I gave them actually the expected response.  I think that people expect violence and you know I think they expected to you know trigger you know someone getting in you know someone, someone's face.  I think that's been, you know that was the--I think he expected that, perhaps because I was in the school halls, he didn't actually expect me at that time but you know in those days it was always I'll see you after school and you know I met a few people after school but so I, I expect that people expected those words you know they're fighting words.  People expected that to trigger a fight.  They thought, however, that if you were in school it wasn't actually going to trigger a fight.  I would, I would say that's the expectation.  One of the things that you know we don't fully appreciate or people who--African Americans don't fully appreciate is what goes on in the homes of you know some white families because I, I remember also walking down the street when I was in high school, maybe college [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], yeah I think I was home for college and was just walking down the street.  There were two little white kids about four or five years old who lived one block over and I was walking by that street and they stood up on their porch and shouted nigger.  And I'm like well obviously these kids don't expect me to punch them so I'm not gonna do that but it just makes you you know what is going on inside that, inside that home when they are at that time the neighborhood had complained so these people poor, were surrounded by poor black folks and you know I'm just walking along the sidewalk.  I don't even think I made eye contact.  I think they--when they shouted the word was when I first noticed that they were there.  And so it's just kind of fascinating when we think about progress and maybe lack of progress.
Story_ID: 296680
Speaker 1: I just thought I'd get that in for the record--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but you weren't a discipline issue in school I don't take it.  I mean I don't think from what you said otherwise.
Speaker 2: Never.  No, I think well not with my mother [Maxine Embry Potter].  Even, even in that instance [at Vaile Elementary School, Richmond, Indiana], I think I got a spanking when I got home.  Because my mother was just you know that was not her--that was not her generation you know.  Her generation was no matter what you know you obey rules, you mind your manners, you're polite to everyone.  So no I was never a discipline issue in schools.  I think I've always been somewhat of a challenge because, because I'm, I'm not afraid to you know speak my mind.  And I think that people who--it's one thing when a poor student complains about the school, when I say poor student, one who doesn't get as, as good a grades, when they complain about the school, it's a different thing when you know your top student is saying you know that there are problems and things that need to be changed.  And everywhere I've gone, I've kind of taken on that role you know.  You first you demonstrate that you know it's not an issue of, of being able to do either the job or well in school or whatever so you kind of take that off the table.  But then you know you do take on the responsibility of saying you know even though this system is working well for me, it's not working well for everyone and you know some changes could be made.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how did you--so you were in the top group in high school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But were you one of the top in the top group or how did that work?
Speaker 2: Our school was kind of interesting and I learned this the hard way that you can't say this you know out in today's politically correct world, but our school was kind of interesting because our phys ed [physical education] courses were very rigorous and so it was very tough to get an A for example in our phys ed because you had to be able to do everything.  You had to you know run a 100 [yard dash].  You had to do 440s [440 yard dash], 880s [880 yard run].  You also had to be able to throw a football a certain distance, a baseball a certain distance.  You had to be able to golf.  You had to be able to all of these things really well in order to get an A if you're a boy.  If you were a girl, it wasn't the same.  It was square dancing and those kinds of things so in a odd way our school said you know here is the top male student and here is the top female student.  I was the top male student in 1975 graduating class and I, I say that's interesting because when I started interviewing for a job in coming out of law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], I made the mistake because I knew no better, I was a country bumpkin, I made the mistake of telling a woman partner at a law firm who was inter- interviewing me for a job, that I was the top male student at Richmond Senior High School [Richmond High School, Richmond, Indiana] and you know she just basically told me a thing or two.  And I had said it completely innocently because of the background, because of this difference in phys ed.  It was very rare for a boy to get an A in phys ed.  And interestingly enough I got an A in phys ed.  I think I got one B+ and it was in geometry but otherwise I got all A's but I got an A in phys ed and so I wasn't even repeating the story because I didn't get an A in phys ed, I was repeating the story because the school focused so much on it that I just got used to repeating the story and it wasn't until you get out into the world and there's this moral of sensitivity and reality around you know that, that looks like chauvinism or sexism or something that it was driven home for me.  But yeah in my, in my class I was the--I graduated with like a 3.97 and I think I took away just about every award that the school gave and I think the most surprising thing that people came to realize when I did graduate, was I was also a top wrestler because everybody thought wrestlers were not the sharpest tools in the shed and so they were really surprised--they, they knew me more as a wrestler and so they were just amazed that you know a wrestler had gotten the grades that I got and was going to the college [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] that I was going to.
Story_ID: 296681
Speaker 1: Now what kind of counseling did you get in high school?
Speaker 2: I think I didn't get good counseling in high school from the counselors.  You know I think that's probably a function of economics and a function of whole number of things as to why it's perhaps tough to get good counselors in high school.  You know you would get that kind of platitudes like well do what you think is right, don't do what other you know people tell you or don't worry about what people think of you and that sort of thing.  Which on its face sounds right, but that's you do have to worry about what other people think of you to some extent.  You at least have to factor it in.  And so I didn't get a lot of what I would call solid counseling from the counselors didn't look for.  I had an English teacher that was a complete anomaly for, for Richmond Senior you know Senior High [Richmond Senior High School; Richmond High School, Richmond, Indiana] but he was the person that I looked to the most, not so much for life counseling, but you know for educational counseling for when I started thinking about colleges, which colleges to apply to and those sort of things.  But you know as it was really looking more to that person because he, he came from the East Coast.  I have no idea how he ended up in Richmond [Indiana].  He was, he was a small you know didn't look like he you know ever played sports or done anything physically active but he was an amazing kind of guy because he was friends with most of the really tough black kids in the school and he had come from, he was white, and came from a prep environment on the East Coast and it was just amazing to you just this guy, but it was because he was so relaxed, he just could not be intimidated and so oddly enough you know some of the toughest black guys in the school would end up at this guy's class you know after hours just talking to him about you know various things and you know I kind of talked to him more about education, what he thought were the great schools--great colleges and why and, and really let him guide my choice of where I went to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what was his name?
Speaker 2: I can't remember his name, but I'll think about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: And what college did you wound up choosing?
Speaker 2: University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], University of Chicago and it was largely on his, on his recommendation.  I'm kind perverse.  I know that I'm not gonna most--like most things so I assume that there was no college that I could go to if I went to do it in advance that I was really gonna like so sight unseen based on his recommendation, I applied and got into University of Chicago and just showed up there on opening day.
Speaker 1: So now that's aspect of you just talked--you just mentioned, you were really that critical of things, huh?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That you really, most things you wouldn't like?
Speaker 2: Most, yeah that's true.  I, I think most things that--well in some respect that may be what makes me a half way decent lawyer is that my mind runs to inconsis- inconsistencies and it is largely critical and you know that presents challenge in family life and in managing people but it's largely critical.
Story_ID: 296682
Speaker 1: Now did, did church play a big part of growing up?  Or how did you--?
Speaker 2: Church I think did play a big part in growing up because again my mother [Maxine Embry Potter] being from the South and sort of old school, she had us in church you on Sunday--every Sunday and so we learned the community and I kind of looked you know looked at church to provide that.  We learned--that's, that's where we you know I think a lot of black people they get their sense of community from the church and we get a sense of you know all the traditions.  You get that from church.  You have a sense of you know the, the ladies auxiliary, the nurses auxiliary you know, the big sisters that sit up front and the reverend pounding and shouting at you and, and when I went to church you know it was in, it was very nice but old brick building with no air conditioning and you had to sit there you know because the sermon would go on for two hours and it would be 90 degrees and humidity and my mother always made us wear suits and sometimes we had to wear winter suits in the summertime and it was very uncomfortable but you did have the sense of family.  So when I think about church now because I'm not, I'm not really a religious person, I think about it in probably two contexts, one is community and sort of passing down of a lot of traditions and the way we do and think about things and two is sort of educational.  That I you know when I go to church I'll listen to hear how people are dealing with you know the tougher things in life because for our churches that's generally you know what they focus on how you get through, how you overcome a number of the tough things in life and I've always been that way.  When I to, when I was--continue to go as a, as a child I would really be listening for the learning side of it.  I was talking to someone the other day about church and I said it kind of dawned on me at one point that most people go to church to pray.  I don't really pray for anything.  I go to church to learn and to feel a sense of community.  And in that respect I think church has had, has had a major influence and it will continue to have an influence on my life.
Story_ID: 296683
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-five[1975] you graduate from Richmond High School [Richmond Senior High School; Richmond High School, Richmond, Indiana] and you go to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Chicago.
Speaker 1: --which is one of the most serious places on the planet.  So well how did you respond, I mean how did you like--well you didn't like it I know, but tell us what your response to it was?
Speaker 2: I, I've always looked at the University of Chicago as what I call the great equalizer because it, it's--and I believe--and I believe well it was then a unique combination of lot of prep school kids and then a lot of kids from public schools, but you absolutely never knew who--which was which.  For whatever reason the same kind of dynamics that I think go on at some East Coast schools where you kind of know if somebody's father is a senator or a doctor or a surgeon, and that sort of things.  That doesn't--that didn't happen at the University of Chicago.  So you really went in and it was on you know how you produced you know.  How well you did at the school.  How you contributed to the, the classes et cetera.  Chicago at that time had an admissions policy that really focused on as they had it graded numerically one to five and then social skills A through E let's say and what they liked to hit was a--on the academics a one so the top and on the social you know somewhere in the C to D range.  So you got a lot of people with very limited social skills I would say but very high on, on the intellectual side.
Speaker 1: Now they consciously chose--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes they did.
Speaker 1: --students like that?  So they wanted students that were socially kind of introverted or, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think introverted is, is actually the best word--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because the school had no athletic programs.  So no football team; contrary to you know the Chicago--the University of Chicago in 1930s.  It they had no football team you know competitive or basketball or baseball.  The, for example, for the football team, they had the, they had guys that dressed up as cheerleaders and the all kazoo band so (laughter) that's not serious.  And you know the student union was de minimis you know the parties were you know de minimis as well.  It was, it was Chicago and I don't know if that's still their motto but it was a life of the mind, the life of the mind was what they were you know in their mind there to develop and to encourage people to do.  So for me it was, it was kind of an interesting thing because it play--on the one hand it played to my introverted sort of educational side and, and I really enjoyed you know the school work.  The kids were a bit harder to handle or, or my fellow students were a bit harder to handle because one of the things I didn't talk about you know growing up, growing up in the schools it was one thing to integrate, it was one thing to, to interact with the majority.  When you interacted in a black community especially amongst the men, boys, it was hierarchical, there was a true pecking order essentially based on you know who could you know, who could beat up whom and that was you know established and every so often would be reestablished when necessary.  But one of the cultural changes in going to Chicago was as I was growing up it was unheard of to get in somebody's face and actually yell at them unless you were prepared to have a fight.  And so you know I, I don't yell very much.  I unfortunately you know had more than my fair share of you know boyhood type fights but one of the things that I had to adjust to at Chicago was that these kids had never you know because of their you high intellect low social skills, they had never been in any physical alterations and just believed that they could say and could do anything.
Story_ID: 296453
Speaker 1: We were talking about some of the cultural challenges at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], people not knowing where their boundaries are and trying to figure out--
Speaker 2: Right.  Then as I, as I was saying being socialized where I was in, in the interaction especially amongst the African American community, there were certain pecking orders and certain hierarchy and you knew not to go outside of that unless you really wanted trouble.  But you know it was never the case that anybody shouted at you or got in your face and yelled unless they were you know prepared to fight.  And--but at the University of Chicago it was the first time that I experienced people who just simply thought that they could say or they could do anything and that you would not have the response.  Now I'm happy to say I never, I never had any fights at the University of Chicago, but it was, it was a bit of a, it was a bit of a cultural adjustment.
Speaker 1: Now did you have anybody walk up to you like that?
Speaker 2: I, I did and that was the thing.  And I guess I have, I have a demeanor that does two things that are very curious to me.  If I'm on the street, walking on the street, I'm gonna be the first person that someone will come up to and ask for directions.  And I've never been able to understand this but it happens just you know more frequently to me than to, to anyone else that I know of and describe that to.  But the other side of my demeanor is that if you do something like you know at some point you've lost your mind and you start you know shouting and you walk up to me, something in my demeanor causes everybody who's ever done that to calm down and back away.  So I don't know what it is, but as one of my, as one of my lawyers recently told me, we were talking about an issue and she said you know I said I'll just have to go talk to that person about this.  And she said oh you know if there's one thing that you know people really don't want to have to go through it's that you know principal of the school look that you give them when you are you know telling them about you know something that they need to change.  So, so it did happen and as I said I tried to learn from it and but I, by--I'm actually glad because I, I don't--I think that our kids should not be socialized to you know to, to be violent or to engage in you know, you know fights and that sort of thing.  And I don't think it should be glorified and unfortunately, I think that's what happens a lot.
Speaker 1: What do you think happened to you to, to make you, you know, temper that, that you know wired in response to--something told you to hold back a little bit.  I mean not to take it all away.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think one of the other things that I think is true and I'm not sure that everyone would agree with is that I, I think I can be empathetic to people and I can and try to understand you know their perspective even in the most heated situations.  I think I can you know understand their perspective.  And I think something like that where they're cultural differences that's, that's where we often can't even begin to you know understand the other person's perspective.  Things just come out of left field.  But when something like that happens to me I, I think to myself I mean look at this person, they can't possibly believe that what they're going to do is going to result in me you know knocking them senseless.  I mean if they believed that, if they understood what the potential was here, they wouldn't be doing what they are doing.  They just don't have it in their background you can you know they don't have it in their experience that this could be the result.  Their experience is no doubt that people get upset about things and they yell back and forth but it's just about an argument.  It's not about you know respect or it's not about you know personally insulting each other, it's just an argument.  They're debating for debates sake or to win an argument, et cetera and they don't understand that in different environments and in different cultures you know that can break--either break down or it sends a very different signal.  So I, I thought it was more you know I would think of, I would think of you know things from their perspective but I'd also have to say that underlying that and something that I've had from a very early age, is just a certain confidence, a certain self-confidence that there's no need for me to you know there's no need for me to teach this person a lesson and it's because I'm, I'm not really threatened by them.  You know I'm not really threatened by them.  And so you know I think when you're, when you're not really threatened, when you're not really you know you don't take things as an insult, you can you know you can be a bit more gracious or magnanimous or empathetic perhaps.
Speaker 1: Okay so you had to decode all this--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --on the spot.
Speaker 2: That's why I say the University of Chicago is like a great equalizer because going there I had no exposure to you know to, to money, to the professions, to you know to the things that go on outside of a town like you know Richmond, Indiana, so it was you know taking advantage of the opportunity you know to some extent to get to know other, other kids you know their families, other perspectives on the world and if you're gonna take advantage of that opportunity you just can't sort of insulate yourself and just stay with what you knew coming in.
Story_ID: 296454
Speaker 1: One of the most fascinating things that I found at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] was, was the kids that actually--especially the black kids that came from Chicago [Illinois] 'cause those kids, it's fascinating to me when I--coming from Richmond, Indiana, I viewed the entire city as my city.  I didn't view the entire area around it as places where I could go and where I did go and in my mind when I think about the city I just kind of know all the streets and you'd be surprised at how at the University of Chicago the kids coming from the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] had never been three blocks off the south you know wherever they lived.  They never been to the Sears Tower [Willis Tower, Chicago, Illinois], they've never been to the Museum of Science and Industry [Chicago, Illinois], never been to you know the Field Museum [Chicago, Illinois] for natural history, it was amazing to me.  In the one year that I--with my first year that I was there, I got to so many more places than the kids from Chicago had, had ever been to because their world or perhaps because Chicago was so big or because it was so segregated or for a host of reasons but their world tended to be no more than three blocks square or however perhaps they had to go--far they had to go to school.  I also found that to be true in New York [New York] and some other big cities.  And I was really surprised at that.
Speaker 2: Well you know there's sort of Cottage Grove [Avenue] is kind of--
Speaker 1: Yelp.
Speaker 2: --is not a real barrier, but it's like--
Speaker 1: Yelp.
Speaker 2: --the psychological barrier between Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois] and the rest of what a friend of mine call Jekyll Park (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But that's--the black communities on one side, solid black communities--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --there are black people in Hyde Park--
Speaker 1: Yes, there are.
Speaker 2: --and but not all of them are well-to-do or going to the school--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but, but most of them are--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --I guess so you have to say.  It's kind of like an island on the South Side in a lot of ways.
Speaker 1: Right but it's also pushing on, I mean it's a lot--it's gone past 63rd [Street], 69th [Street], it's moved up passed 47th [Street] so it's interesting.
Speaker 2: Do you remember Hyde Park High School [Hyde Park Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] when you were there was considered Woodlawn [Chicago, Illinois], remember that?
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: It used to be Hyde Park, Hyde Park used to extend that far--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --got pushed back up with the black migration I think.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It's, it's the dynamic.
Story_ID: 296455
Speaker 1: What was your major in school?
Speaker 2: My major in school I picked, I, I went through the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] in three years because I tested out of a number of subjects.  I took grad classes my last year which was the third year and at the end of all that had to go see a counselor to find out what my major was going to be and we were with the addition of one class I had a major in behavioral science and my minor is in philosophy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Behavioral science okay.  Who were some of your teachers there?  Did you have favorite teachers that you?
Speaker 2: I think I had, I had--I wasn't and I, I, I consider that to be a missed opportunity.  Coming from my background, I wasn't into--or did not participate in class you know the way that I--actually I wish I would had, but coming from my background, we didn't--it wasn't cool to participate in, in class.  So when I got to the University of Chicago, that teachers on the Socratic Method I would rarely engage with the, with the class discussion, I would rarely engage with the professors whereas the other students would go you know visit the professors, kind of knew the professors on a, on a personal basis et cetera.  I would rarely do that. And again I think that's part of the, maybe part of our consul- culture that does not serve us well or at least did not serve me well because I think you're getting so much more out of life and certainly out of school if you are an active participant.  So, so unfortunately, I, I didn't really focus on my professors that you know that much and certainly didn't have you know much of an interaction with them after class, not that much interaction during class and certainly not that much you know after class.  If I, if I would remember a professor it wouldn't be so much because of his name, it might be because of his reputation you know for example I had a professor whose strength was actually African studies.
Speaker 1: Who was that?
Speaker 2: I'll have to--like I said I didn't really focus on their names, but his, his because he had to teach a number of courses, he also taught Western Civilization and I remember I took Western Civilization from him and ended up getting a B for the course because he was a very hard grader and so the next year and it's just the kind of person I am.  The next year I decided to well I will take him again but for African studies because that's his home turf and he you know supposed to be a very tough grader and I viewed that as a, as a challenge so I took that and actually got an A you know in his toughest subject.  But that's how I tended to think about professors.  It was more along the lines of I wasn't gonna get to know them as, as people really that you know if they were supposed to be very tough graders and teach very hard courses, then that's something that I wanted to do as opposed to shy away from and something like that for, for whatever reason I kind of took it personal when I got a B in his course for something that he wasn't as strong as I wanted to go back and take him, take him again.  And then I took--there were a couple of and one of these days I'll think of the names but I didn't really focus on names.  I focused more on there was another guy who did antro- anthropology who had just some great thoughts and I remember you know working through the course material, working through the classes, had some questions and went to talk to him after hours about you know the questions I had.  And this was kind of my experience both in college and in law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], I was disappointed.  I was disappointed in talking with the guy one-on-one because a number of professors they have a, I think a persona, this was my experience and maybe very limited, have a persona in class that at least with respect to me wasn't the same when I would try to interact with them one-on-one.  And so maybe it was that.  Maybe that after the first couple of attempts I didn't quite you know resonate as well with the professor one-on-one as I did if perhaps I asked my question in, in class.
Story_ID: 296456
Speaker 1: And then, then maybe the last thing I'd say on that is that as far as I remember and I hope I don't slight anyone, there were no African American professors at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] during my years.  And so the--you know I--there really wasn't much for me to identify.
Speaker 2: There were a few I know there.
Speaker 1: That you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't know if you had them in the courses you--in the departments--
Speaker 1: And that's probably the issue.
Speaker 2: William Julius Wilson was there.
Speaker 1: Oh he was definitely there.  Was he doing undergrad work?  He was doing undergrad right, right.
Speaker 2: He had just, he published his book 'The Declining Significance of Race[: Blacks and Changing American Institutions,' William Julius Wilson]--
Speaker 1: 'Race' right.
Speaker 2: --in '77 [sic. 1978]--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --and [HistoryMaker] John Hope Franklin--
Speaker 1: Franklin.
Speaker 2: Franklin was at the tail end of his--
Speaker 1: Right
Speaker 2: --tenure there.
Speaker 1: Exactly.  John Hope Franklin actually I know some underclassmen had taken one of his courses.  That was more history I think--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Civil War that sort of thing--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: --and I did not take it but you're right John Hope Franklin, William Julius Williams [sic. William Julius Wilson] was, I forget what school he was in, but I didn't have a--
Speaker 2: Sociology.
Speaker 1: --sociology.  Didn't have the opportunity both you know I'm sorry I've forgotten those but both very strong people.
Speaker 2: But there weren't many.  You didn't have any black professors at all?
Speaker 1: Didn't have any, yeah.  And so with a, with a socialization that would not cause me to reach out to people to begin with, the fact that there were you know in the classes that I took, you know no people of color as I recall made it you know just that much tougher.  And then you gotta remember and although they must have been used to it, back in the '70s [1970s] was when you had hair out to here.  You should have in one of the pictures that you received but you know an afro out to your shoulders and I'm wearing you know jeans and, and my converses and a blue jean jacket and a t-shirt you know.  I'm not sure what I looked like to them in any event but I you know to some extent as I said it is, it is unfortunate.  I didn't not until I got to the law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and people like Derrick Bell [HistoryMaker Derrick A. Bell, Jr.] that I really start to reach out to professors and even then, it was, it was really pretty limited.
Story_ID: 296457
Speaker 1: How was your social life in, in, in college?  I guess from high school [Richmond Senior High School; Richmond High School, Richmond, Indiana] through college?  You're the only black person in class for the most part and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know the--I think some extent it depends on the person.  'Cause I'm an introvert you know.  Have always been you know more turned inward.  My social life, but on the other hand my social life actually has, has always been pretty good.  You know in, in our community and in Chicago [Illinois] we had a small, we had a small group of people but we tended to either get out into the city or interact with you know our colleagues at Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois] or at some of the other schools so I actually thought the social life was you know for me again an introvert pretty good.
Speaker 1: Now did you have like a Black Student Organization?
Speaker 2: We did, yeah we did had the Black Student Organization.  It wasn't, it wasn't as active you know as some other schools might have been.  We had some grad students who would you know come in and try to fire things up and but again we were kind of picked in, in Chicago's [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] model so we were high on the you know intellectual side and low on the social skills side so you know there weren't a whole lot of, a whole lot of things that we're gonna go charging off into the night on.
Speaker 1: Do you remember I think the Black Student Organization a couple years brought James Turner in to speak for Black History Month, do you remember?
Speaker 2: James Turner, no, no.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: From Cornell [University, Ithaca, New York].
Speaker 2: Yeah I don't know.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I made the flyer for him.
Speaker 2: Oh is that right.  Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I remember and I went over to hear it--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --they somebody from the school would come over to Third World Press [Chicago, Illinois] where I was working at.  I'd make the flyer for him--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --for about three or four years in a row.  But that may have been after you were there.  I don't know.  It may have been afterwards.
Story_ID: 296458
Speaker 1: Anything sig- else about University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] you wanna talk about before we move you to law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?  Or how did you decide to go to law school?
Speaker 2: I went to law school, I decided actually to go to law school because I had a fundamental lack of knowledge of what lawyers do.  You know my background you either worked at a factory which was you know a shift so you had the first shift or your second or the gra- graveyard shift.  Or you were like my mother [Maxine Embry Potter] who worked as a librarian and she left the house every day at 8:30 and came home every day at quarter til six.  So that was my only experience and I thought that that's how the world kind of worked.  So when I was finishing up college, I wanted to do two things.  I'll get to law school first and in the interim but I thought you know what I need to go out here and get trained to actually earn a living and but I don't wanna give up you know reading philosophy and studying philosophy so why not become a lawyer and when you get home a quarter of six every night, you can read philosophy. (Laughter) I'm serious.  I had no idea.  And so I applied to, I applied to law schools and I done you know very well at the University of Chicago and so was able to get into law school and that's really how I, how I went off to law school.  Now interestingly enough I had always thought when I was a kid that I wanted to be a counselor and obviously that is the title of what I do now because I mean it just seems to be my personality.  I you know I talk to people about their issues and kind of bring to bear you know a certain amount of judgment et cetera.  So that piece of it has worked out.
Story_ID: 296459
Speaker 1: Before going to law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], I had a year because I finished as I said Chicago [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] in three years, I had a year and I decided to be a dialysis technician for about a year and I did that because I was deathly afraid of the sight of blood.  It actually made me faint.  So I felt that there was no better way to get over that fear than to be a dialysis technician where you had to deal with blood on a daily basis.  Now that was a very interesting experience.  It was, it was an odd exposure.  It was an exposure to people you know when you think about it having to get dialyzed every couple of days and how that kind of tied you down.  It was an exposure to people who at a very young age and typically these who were Hispanic or blacks who had had kidney failure, so you're like eighteen and your whole life is in front of you but it's dialysis and unless you find you know a donor kidney and as they would sit in their chairs being dialyzed I would kind of sit there with them and just made you think about life and to some extent how precarious it can be based on, on your health and what happens to you.  And the other thing that was an interesting exposure was to the kind of people that are out there in the work both on the positive and on the negative side.  I think the people in the chairs were a positive experience.  The clinics and the doctors who are making money off of those people were the more negative experience because you know the government reimburses every dialysis treatment to a certain dollar amount but underneath that they're assuming for example that you're using a new cleansing element every time that the person comes in so they pay for that.  A lot of the clinics back then would reuse the cylinders repeatedly.  Charge for a new one, reuse the cylinder.
Speaker 2: Like blowing out an air filter in a car and putting it back in?
Speaker 1: Exactly.  No that's exactly.  You rinsed it out.  You rinsed it out and then you reused it.  And the, and the, the complexity of it was for the patient a new filter that actually works very well is actually tougher on them because they go from a very toxic body, their body, to a very clean body.  And that is a dramatic change.  It actually puts them through pain.  It allows them to go longer you know until they come back in for dialysis but the dramatic change is not as tough as a reused element because they go from being toxic to somewhat less toxic as opposed to being clean.  And there's for the patient it was easier to get through the dialysis treatment but they would have to come back sooner.  So you could see how the dynamic would work that they're coming back sooner and therefore the clinic or the doctor could be charged you know could charge again for a new element faster than if they actually used the clean one.  And it was surprising to me because again lacking the exposure, I would see the doctor who owned the clinic and he would come and you know he always had a great car whether it was a Mercedes [Mercedes-Benz] or whatever and he would come in and he would go talk to the people and he would have a great bedside manner and you know as a kid coming out of college I thought, man, this is great you know, here's a person serving you know the minority community, he wasn't minority, he's serving the minority community, he goes from chair to chair you know trying to lift their spirits et cetera, et cetera and you know and like a kid I said something like that to one of the nurses you know.  Isn't doctor so and so and then she explained to me the economics of it and you know that's just a lesson that I think we all have to learn and unfortunately is repeated you know over and over again in, in our economy.  And it actually has taught me to--I, I reserve opinion on, on everyone and everything for a while until I understand how, how things actually operate.  It doesn't make me necess- I don't think it makes me necessarily pessimistic or bitter but I think you have to understand you know how things, how things actually work.
Speaker 2: So you kind of reserve (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah and, and it also shows you what a mixed bag it is because as I said patients actually preferred to have a reused unit you know because it made the dialysis easier even though they would have to come back sooner.  But the government and again I don't even know whether it was government collusion or not.  The government paid I mean these guys were making a fabulous amount of money and that's, that's the piece that irritates me.  When you make a fabulous amount of money off the backs of you know the sick and, and the unfortunate and then also you know go to the lengths of making them think that you're doing them a favor.  Troubling.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you did this while you were at college or?
Speaker 1: Yeah when I finished up college and did this for a year before going to law school.
Speaker 2: Okay. Now what's the name of that position you were at?
Speaker 1: Dialysis technician.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.  And is this on the South Side of Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 1: The clinic was actually on the Near North Side--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --down on Rush Street.  I'll never forget it was down on Rush Street, caught the Jeffery Express [Jeffery Manor Express] down to the Loop every day, walked about a mile 'cause I just liked to walk once I got off that bus.  Walked about a mile to the Rush Street--to this clinic on Rush Street, which I'm not sure is there any more.
Story_ID: 296460
Speaker 1: So you, you came out in what '79 [1979]?
Speaker 2: Seventy-nine [1979].
Speaker 1: Seventy-nine [1979] okay.  So in 1980 you went to Howard--I mean Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: In September of '79 [1979].
Speaker 1: September of '79 [1979], okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  I actually officially graduated [from University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] December 15th of 1978 but my class was you know June of '79 [1979] and went to Harvard in September of '79 [1979].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well now this is the '70s [1970s] and I remember Harvard Law School was in the minds of a lot of people because we saw the movie 'The Paper Chase.'  Did you see that before you--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't, of course, not.  I never check a place out before I go because I know I won't like it.
Speaker 1: Everybody sees John Houseman in their mind standing--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --back asking--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but so you didn't have that image in your head--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --and all which is probably good--
Speaker 2: Yeah it was.
Speaker 1: --so but did you have an impression of Harvard Law School when you?
Speaker 2: You know I picked Harvard--I'm kind of a simple person--I picked Harvard for the same reason that I picked University of Chicago.  You know at the time it was viewed to be you know the toughest law school in the country and so toughest and I suppose they translate that to the best.  But I thought that it would be the greatest challenge and so you know I wanted to rise to that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how did you find it when you're there?
Speaker 2: The law school is, I would say those three years are probably about the worst three years that I've, that I've experienced.  I put, I put an awful lot of it out of my mind because it was so bad.  I mean I was one of those students where they didn't find a--they didn't have a place for me to stay you know in the dormitories.  They notified me a month before school opened that I would have to get here two weeks before, before classes to find a place of my own.  I drove out here with all my belongings in a U-Haul to come out here.  I mean I, I didn't really know how to--I didn't know the area, I didn't how to look for an apartment.  I got out here.  I parked the U-Haul in a motel right around here on the Harvard Square [Cambridge, Massachusetts] and literally lived out of that U-Haul for the first two weeks of, of law school and then found a just a, a one room in just a horrific place down the street from, from campus.  And I, I've always thought that you know people come to the law school and I think and then they come out of the law school and you know are very proud of where they were in the class or things like as if, as if we all started you know basically you know from the same point and had essentially the same you know outside burdens.  But you know for the folks who are in Hastings Hall who could come home every day to the fireplace and to their own bedroom versus you know starting out from a U-Haul truck for two weeks finding a place that you know,  my mother [Maxine Embry Potter], my mother never visited me there.  I would, I would not have shown her the place I had to stay my first year.  I was you know friends in dorms were allowing me to use their showers.  I had virtually no money.  I was telling somebody the other day the I believe you know at the Hark [Harkness Cafeteria] here, I was on full financial aid but they gave us coupons and so you could eat during the week.  But on the weekends where you had to go with your own money you know I ate once a day usually around five o'clock.  On Sundays a friend of mine who was also without money, he and I would split like a small pizza right around the corner here.  It was, it was a really, really tough experience and then to go to the same classes when it was back in those days at Harvard it was the sort of embarrass the student mentality.
Story_ID: 296684
Speaker 1: Tell us about the--some of those experiences in law classes.
Speaker 2: Well the, the, the model, the model for the law school I think it was probably supposed to be similar to the model for example at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] which was sort of the Socratic Method where you try to draw out the, the answers you know from the students to try to demonstrate that they know something that they didn't realize that that they did know but I think unfortunately at the law school it, it turned more into yeah I wouldn't--you wouldn't call it harassment nor would you necessarily call it you know belittling people but you know at the end of the day it was the far- farthest thing from being supported and you know I was talking to somebody about that and you know how tough that the other person thought that it might be I never really viewed it that way.  I mean I thought as I said I thought the University of Chicago was an equalizer.  I came to Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] to, to learn a trade and you know to be able to go out into the world and, and make a living so I never really viewed it the same way as I viewed college where I was studying things that you know I just kind of really lined up with.  And then as far as the professors and I had you know none too few professors who you know were of that traditional stripe that they would you know embarrass a student you know in front, in front of the class in the most you know in some respects perhaps the most humiliating way because you make very smart people appear to be very stupid.  I mean you know their intelligence is sort of their stock and trade and to undermine that you know you may go a long way toward you know undermining you know the overall person and you kind of ask yourself what is the point of that.  But I looked at it, I really did look at it this way, which was I--when I came to law school I completely switched whereas in college I been philosophy, behavioral science, anthropology, et cetera.  When I came to law school it was to learn a trade and when I wanted to learn about was corporations, business and finance.  So I went from you know a person who paid very little attention to math, who paid--who didn't even know what a corporation really was, I have no idea what a stockholder was really when I walked through the door at law school.  Took courses, I took you know every corporate course including corporate tax that I could take and I would call you know corporate tax in particular, which I think I took with Bernard Wolfman who you know otherwise was, was, was just fine, but you know I would recall that we would be working through some provision of, of corporate tax and we'd get to the point and he would ask you know a question and I think you know there were more than one time when you know I would simply say I don't know.  I don't know the answer to that.  And other kids that you know that would bother them, they aren't kids, you know that would bother them no end when they got to the point where you either gave the wrong answer or admitted you know forced to admit that they didn't know the answer.  From my perspective, here's a person who's been teaching corporate tax twenty years, you know.  I, you know, brand new to corporations let alone corporate tax, if I'm on this person's turf you know it should not be very hard for him to you know humiliate me at all I mean that should be a you know no-brainer and certainly nothing for, for him to be proud of or and I just use a specific name, but I think you could genericize that across and that if I were doing that position you know I would be much more focused on encouraging the kids, motivating the kids, building their knowledge on their recognition that they can't possibly know as much about you know corporate tax, securities law, accounting for lawyers as I do.  And so the issue of you know who can humiliate who is no issue.  This is, this is no issue.  So I never felt bad about that.  I never felt bad, I always--you always work hard, you do your best.  You know if you go to a class and you don't know the answer and you know that's made you know very plain in front of your classmates, it's, it's in my opinion, it was no reflection you know on your overall abilities, on your intellect or whatever and that you were there to learn, you were there to learn and you know this person was, was the expert and there's no way that you're gonna know as much or more about, about that.
Story_ID: 296685
Speaker 1: And I would say in a lot of ways that that approach may be the most destructive thing that the law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] does because if I saw anything coming out of the law school, it was kids who came in with a lot of self-confidence and motivation after their years at law school left without that.  And when you get out into the work a day world people can say what they want but more studies are coming out.  The skills you need as a lawyer are really tied to your confidence, to your ability to exercise judgment and over the long term to your motivation.  You know lawyers we're the most depressed profession out there.  I mean alcoholism runs rampant through us.  We are the most unhappy profession you know out there even though we're the highest paid.  Because I think we run out of motivation, we lose our confidence, we don't enjoy what we're doing in some respects because we're not you know using our best skills, but the law schools at least historically didn't help with that.  It does not help to you know to demotivate people and to undermine, undermine their confidence.  And if there was anything that that perhaps my mother [Maxine Embry Potter] instilled but perhaps I just had and she kind of reinforced was you know self-confidence and not to lose that and you know to, to stay motivated and stay positive about what you're doing and that you know a test is just a snap shot.  It's just what you knew then.  One of the things that I didn't say about the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and about law school was a lot of people when they took a test and if they didn't do well, they never revisited the subject or understood why they didn't do well on a test.  I'd always believed a test is just a snapshot and if you didn't do well on it, the best thing you can do is to back into that subject you know to keep on studying in that subject, to find out what you did wrong and learn because it's supposed to be about learning.  It's not supposed to be about how well you could do you know at a moment in time and I think if more, more people or kids had focused on it that way, that law school, the grades that you got at the end of year one even though they have a huge impact on, on your overall career, et cetera where you go, so many kids shut down at that point as opposed to saying it's just a moment in time there are a whole host of other law subjects that I'm going to be studying, there are some that obviously perhaps I didn't learn as well as I should have.  I need to go back into that.  I need to get over the pain of the bad grade or whatever and go back into that because it's about learning, it's not about you know just that moment in time grade.
Story_ID: 296686
Speaker 1: Did law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] change you any?
Speaker 2: It had to.  I mean it had to have changed me.  I mean I--you continue to grow in law school and I probably grew in a number of different directions.  I had never met truly affluent blacks before I came to law school and I think that was a you know a growth experience and you begin to see some of the things that for example what William Julius Wilson was talking about when he talks about you know some of the really significant differences in our society have more to with economic class than they do with race because I think a lot of you know affluent people of color, period, a lot of the thoughts line up more with you know affluent people than they do with you know their ethnic group or whatever.  I never experienced that until I got to law school and actually met the daughters and sons of you know black surgeons and black politicians and significant business people.  So I think that that expanded my horizons to a great degree.  I think I had never you know law school exposed me to certainly some very intelligent people and I think I started coming around more to the view of it's not intelligence per se that makes, that makes good people or kind of really sets you know the contribution they're gonna make, it's, it's their character and what they do with their intelligence 'cause it'll--you know I think there's a fair number of people that use their intelligence you know to further oppress the already oppressed or the weak and so it's not just intelligence that you know kind of determines what a person's overall contribution is gonna be to society.  And then I think law school probably made me, I'm not, I'm not one of those people that came out of law school you know charged up to do public you know, public good and public work.  I think I see the need for it.  But I saw as much of a need for you know people of color to be in the business world and to you know try to influence that that world.  I think I was very naive though.  I thought you know you could go into the business world and you know there was a certain amount of change that you could you could affect either right away and it would be pretty dramatic you know.  Being on the inside of corporation as I am now for example you know it's tough to move organizations and you know there's only so much that you can do but I do think it is important that we be here to, to do it.  So if I, if I think about overall I think a lot of the law schools certainly expanded my horizons.  I don't know that I thought--think a lot differently coming out of law school because--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've heard people say that now they think differently because they went to law school or because they're a lawyer and so--
Speaker 2: Yeah because of my undergrad, I think I came in thinking you know certain logical way and I think that I just refined that perhaps and turned it to different subjects in law school so I don't think it really changed me there but you know but then you did--you do get more exposure to you know to the you know the kinds of things that go on in the world that you just don't get either when you're isolated at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] or you're from a small town in Indiana [Richmond, Indiana].  You know I keep trying to think of the, the, the positive things or the good things that may come out of law school, but I'm not, I'm not sure it's really there to do that for you.  I think it's you know they can make some changes in the way that you think but I think a lot of it depends on how you come out of law school and what you do with it you know after that.
Story_ID: 296687
Speaker 1: Did you have classes with Derrick Bell [HistoryMaker Derrick A. Bell, Jr.] when--
Speaker 2: I did, I had classes with Derrick Bell and those were you know very enjoyable classes.
Speaker 1: Now he was the only black professor at (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At that time, that's right, that's right.  And he was swamped.  You know that's one of the sad things about being the only one is that you know every student you know comes to you with their problems and their issues every African American student in particular comes to you with their problems and their issues and--excuse me--they need help with this and they need help with that.  And so again perhaps perversely I didn't interact with Derrick much while I was here [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] because I thought you know, he--the last thing he needs is one more person you know kind of dumping a load of problems at his doorstep or challenges because he, he, he did that you know he, he counseled people you know from all three classes, from you know people who had already left the law school and I always felt that that was a a tough burden for him to carry in addition to having to work the politics of, politics of the law school which you know were a challenge in and of themselves.
Story_ID: 296688
Speaker 1: Did you come into contact with people in the black studies department [Department of Afro-American Studies; Department of African and African American Studies] here or they--?
Speaker 2: Not really that much.  Not really that much.  Well there's, there's just a little overlap with, with the other areas of the university [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]. Occasionally the law students would put on you know programs with black studies or some of the other some of the other divisions but you know not really that much.  I'd have to say that probably one of the mixed bags about you know perhaps people like myself is that we have to be very focused to get done what we get done I mean you don't get to be you know general counsel of a company by chasing off in a whole lot of directions but the other side of that is we probably don't get involved in as many things as we should and don't understand as many things as we should because you, you know you tend to get you know you tend to get more focused.  I think the important thing though is perhaps that even though you have a certain focus in, and, and work to achieve things that you don't forget you know for example as the general counsel that you can impact the diversity of your law department, you can impact the diversity of law firms if you have a mind to do it and so you know you gotta keep that motivation, but I'd have to say that you know I'm coming to the law school I have what's part of the BLSA [Black Law Students Association; National Black Law Students Association (NBLSA)] and I put on a BLSA conference and I was very active in the Black Law Students Association but you know didn't have a broad understanding of a lot of the political items that were going on at that time and you know probably should have done better about that.
Story_ID: 296689
Speaker 1: And did you interact with the business school [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts] at all?
Speaker 2: No, not really much with the, with the business school at all.  I mean the, the, the law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] I mean creates a tremendous demand on your time.  I think one of the things that, that makes the law school what it is, is not so much professors but the students because the students' view that's your actual competition and you know there are no, there are no boundaries, there's no set study time for example so there was always this myth that somebody was studying twenty-four hours a day and so you felt like you just had to keep devoting more and more time to it because everybody else was and that was your competition.  So I would say that that the law school and studying you know as long as you stayed motivated was almost all-consuming you know to try to--you know I was--I don't think they would let me have a job the first year or I'm not even sure if it was any years that they would let me have a job you know simply because they you know wanted to be sure that I stayed focused on, focused on classes.
Speaker 1: So you weren't able to work and go to school?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't work at all in law school.  I did work when I was at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 296690
Speaker 1: Graduation [from Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] must have been a relief, I would guess?
Speaker 2: You know I was so disillusioned with the process I didn't even go to graduation.  I mean I, I was like I said I was raised in an environment or came up in an environment where we just didn't participate as much as we should so I went straight from my last class to my, my first job [at Keck, Mahin and Cate, Chicago, Illinois], didn't go to graduation, which was a mistake because you should celebrate these things you know.  You should have something.  When you have something to celebrate you should celebrate it.  So--
Speaker 1: How did your mother [Maxine Embry Potter] react to all this I mean?  Did--I, well.
Speaker 2: My you know you don't tell your mother a lot of things you know.  You know you don't tell your mother a lot of things.  You just kind of give them the top line good news.  So I don't think I ever told my mother until she sees this that for example how I started with the law school and you know she, she'd be beside herself if she knew I was living out of that truck for a couple of, couple of weeks and like I said I never showed her where I stayed. Whenever she would come to town, she would be in a motel and I'd say mom you really don't have time to go by, go by where I stay.  You know let's just do dinner and do these kinds of things.  And you tended to--I tended to shield my mother from most of the things that were going on and then with respect to graduation, I just told her that you know I needed to start my job right away and you know I already had my diploma and you know I just really didn't need to go through the ceremony.  So you know from mother you know there was a completely different picture of, of law school and some extent undergrad [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] because you just didn't, you didn't share.  I mean I didn't share those kinds of things and part because I just thought it would be a burden and one of the things that I don't do is burden people with things that they can't do anything about.  And from her perspective is I can't do anything about this.  I can't you know I went to undergrad and law school on full scholarship.  It was financially-based.  I mean we didn't--she didn't have the money.  So you don't burden people you know with things that can be solved by money if they don't have the money because it just makes them in my opinion, it makes them feel worse.  So I gave her the sanitized kind of idyllic version of, of law school and, and undergrad and you know I still kind of do that to this day.  You know just because it's I, I just don't think you, you burden people with those kinds of things.
Story_ID: 296691
Speaker 1: Where did you get your first job?
Speaker 2: I started at Keck, Mahin and Cate in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: What year is this?  This is?
Speaker 2: Keck, K-E-C-K, Mahin, M-A-H-I-N, and Cate, C-A-T-E.
Speaker 1: Okay know now what year is this?  This is?
Speaker 2: This is 1982.
Speaker 1: Eighty-two [1982] okay.  So you're in Chicago as the Harold Washington campaign is brewing, I mean is starting to take form?
Speaker 2: That's exactly right.  That's exactly right.  I--Keck was about the tenth largest firm in Chicago at the time and I really hit it off with the partner who interviewed me Wes Walton [Wesley Walton], who proved I was only there two years but he was a great mentor and got me off to a great start in the legal business which is critical I've come to learn over the years.  But I'd spent one summer with Keck and then went back with them you know permanently in 1982, working out of the Sears Tower [Willis Tower, Chicago, Illinois].  And actually did get involved in Harold Washington's campaign. Did poll watching, did you know setting up some of the campaign stops. I was--that was one of the few that times that I you know really got involved in in politics, understood the--you know the issues.  And a lot of that stemmed from my years as an undergrad [at University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] in Chicago and watching the Mayor Richard [J.] Daley machine operate in Chicago and just feeling that you know there had to be a change from that and so I think we had Mayor [Jane] Byrne and then I worked in the Harold Washington campaign.  You know there, there are some things that you work on that you know just sort of leave you that great you know that great feeling. I think the Million Man March maybe was one of the things that if you got involved in left you a great feeling.  That Harold Washington campaign you know that was one of the, the best efforts and the best feeling you had about you know collaboration and working as a group and actually getting something done and I was just you know it's just heartbreaking really that you know he died so soon and you know somewhat disappointing of that he died of things that you know just changing personal habits you know he might have been able to you know to live a bit longer.  And it was such a crucial thing.  I--you always have this dilemma about someone for example in Harold Washington's position where you know he's become such a symbol you know in Chicago as a symbol and as the mayor did you have an obligation you know to change some of your personal habits you know to stop smoking, to perhaps start eating better, you know to exercise, et cetera.  So because you know there's more riding on this than just you know, than just you.  I think there used to be a commercial about you know when they were selling life insurance or something but they you know they looked at an individual's habits and tried to say you know you need to think about your family in that case that you impact by these habits if you're gone and I've always thought that that was just, just too bad.  I mean regardless of you know the things that he could accomplish, did accomplish, would accomplish I think it would have been so important for him to have been in that office you know for you know for a good amount of time and that was kind of cut short.
Speaker 1: Did you--were you a part of organizations with the other black lawyers in Chicago?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That was primarily (unclear).  Most of the black lawyers you know were really organized and you know to do as much as we could for that campaign and a whole host of areas not, obviously you do the fundraising but you know in the speeches and researching the issues, et cetera you know to getting out the very day and doing you know the poll watching which I did and you know Chicago is very segregated neighborhood and I did it in you know in, in, in one of the ethnic white neighborhoods and it you know it was what it was but again it was kind of an eye-opener as to just how you know just what the tensions are and you know between neighborhoods and between races at that time and I said just kind of reinforces the fact that you know it was a very important thing for him to be elected mayor and you know it was important to me at least that that he would have been mayor a couple of terms but that's the way it goes.
Story_ID: 296692
Speaker 1: You were there a couple of years, right? So--
Speaker 2: I was at Keck [Keck, Mahin and Cate, Chicago, Illinois] for a couple of years.  It was a great experience.  I think so many lawyers, their first year or so has an impact on their career that they don't fully appreciate because law firms are a kind of environment where you--if you get a great reputation it carries you along much farther than it should and if you get a bad reputation based on one or two projects, it hinders you much more than it should.  And I was fortunate enough to get started on, on the right foot and work with you know Wes Walton [Wesley Walton] in particular but, but other partners who gave me a tremendous amount of responsibility very early on in my career and so I you know just built my confidence that I could, that I could do the job.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So after two years, is that when you went to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: After two years my wife [Myrtle Stephens Potter] at time had an opportunity to advance at her company.  I was fairly new to the practice and you're very mobile at that point and so I left Keck at that time to go out to Morgan, Lewis and Bockius in Philadelphia.
Story_ID: 296693
Speaker 1: Tell us about getting married now, we--this is--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I got married right out of law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  My ex and I, Myrtle Stephens at the time, we met in--at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] in 1976 and then got married as soon as I graduated from law school.  I guess I graduated in June, took the bar in July and then we got married July 31st of 1982.
Speaker 1: Okay and you both lived in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: We lived in Chicago for, for two years and then she got the opportunity to go with Merck [Merck & Co., Inc.] essentially in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], one of the suburbs around there.  It was a great opportunity for her at the time and as I said I was completely mobile two years practicing a firm and Morgan Lewis [Morgan, Lewis and Bockius, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] much larger firm than Keck [Keck, Mahin and Cate, Chicago, Illinois].  I think Morgan Lewis is typically the fourth, fifth largest firm in the country and so at--with good references from my, from my existing firm was able to move out to Morgan Lewis.  I guess that was what 1984?
Story_ID: 296694
Speaker 1: How do you, I guess matriculated you know to a higher job at a law firm you just kind of learned more about corporate law as you practiced, is that what happens?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's interesting, but it's all, it's typically just very rote you know seniority you know.  First year associate, second year associate up to fifth to seventh year associate before they make the decision to you know whether you're gonna be a partner or not so--and ideally you get more responsibility as you you know gain more seniority so for example if you're working on a merger transaction as a first year associate, you're just basically reading documents and telling other people you know what the corporation's documents say and then as you move up the ladder, you might be supervising the people who are reading the documents and you might be you know responsible for drafting the merger agreement or something like that. And then as you get farther up, you're supervising all those people but instead of drafting the merger agreement, you're negotiating with the other side. So it's just basically seniority and as I say with any luck it's based on what's actually happening to you as you're expanding your experience.  So I think my first couple of years you know I was basically working under a partner, a senior associate.  By the time I was a fifth year associate, I was running my own transactions.  So basically just loop a partner in every so often to tell him what was going on and then when the final bill was ready to be presented, the partner would do that.  But about my fifth year or so I was running my own transactions which means that the firm is confident with you know with letting me do your thing.  I think the unfortunate thing that happens especially to people of color and, and women is that if the first project or so that you, that you do for whatever reason you know is criticized and you get off to a bad start, it's, it's--law firms in a lot of ways are so poorly managed that nobody takes it upon themselves to say well first of all it's a brand new lawyer you know.  The odds are that their work is not gonna be you know top notch the first time out but what happens is because you get sort of this rep that your first project or whatever project wasn't you know completely up to snuff, perversely enough you get fewer projects.  So you could go from one or two or three years and at the end of three years you have only the experience of basically a first year associate and I think that's where you know that's where we in particular run into a lot of problems that we get to be fifth and seventh year and have only two years of real experience.
Story_ID: 296472
Speaker 1: Do you have any good stories from your corporate law experiences at this stage in your life?
Speaker 2: It's probably a good thing if, if corporate lawyers don't have a lot of good stories you'd want, you'd want those stories to come from entertainment lawyers and from you know from from litigators who tend to see you know the, the really crazy things that, that, that go on in life.  I think it's interesting to see sometimes how the world has changed.  I know when I started with, with Keck [Keck, Mahin and Cate, Chicago, Illinois], I got a lot of, I got a lot of early responsibility and I was sitting on a conference call at one point whereby the partner involved was talking to the business people, I think it was the CEO, and they were talking about a union dispute that they were anticipating and I think the subject of security came up and the, the partner asked the CEO well you know how are you gonna handle security for this event?  And the response over the phone, obviously not knowing I was in the room, this was what 1982, '83 [1983], the CEO said well I'm just gonna hire two of the biggest blackest niggas I can find and put them in front of the door.  And the partner turned beet red oh and you know I tried to and try to cover it off but it was, it was, it was--I thought it was funny.  Actually I did think it was funny.  I think it's you know in some respects we have to recognize that you know people aren't politically correct when they think they're talking to you know when they don't think that there's any reason to be political correct.  So I, I've always remembered that story more for the fact that the partner you know was so you know was so embarrassed than, than anything else.  You know there are, there are the kinds of things that go on in the law firms that you would you know for example never expect and there are a lot of, there are a lot of really good people in law firms but they're also a lot of petty tyrants and you know there are the stories of which I experienced the tax partner who was you know famous for just losing his temper at associates and at his secretary, et cetera and he at one point lost his temper to, to the extent where he actually hit his secretary and he was, he was a smaller guy so far from the expected response of the secretary you know like grabbing her face--he slapped her I believe--grabbing her face and running out of the room, she slapped him back and knocked him across the desk (laughter).  So, so you know it's those kinds of you know those kinds of you know bizarre events that happened probably in, in you know in every, in every workplace but you know I think the--when you're younger in the profession you know you tend to do things that are a little bit off the beaten path but as you move up, and especially in a firm, as you move up in the ranks a lot of the stuff stays you know within certain you know boundaries if you're on my side of the you know practice.  If you get into for example the labor and employment things and the sexual harassment and the whole host of things you know in those areas the--sometimes the stories are just you know beyond belief that you hear but from my side of the practice it is--a lot of it has been you know just very straightforward with just the, just the you know the incidences every so often that relate to either business or the clients or things like that.
Story_ID: 296473
Speaker 1: Correct me if I'm wrong, but I suppose what you do basically is to make sure the transactions take place the way they should and that things--I mean you don't have to deal with for instance criminal lawyers have a lot of like moral issues or whether they're defending someone whose really not a really good person or they're prosecuting somebody to the fullest extent of law they really can't defend themselves and they don't really know if the person did it or not, all those kinds of stories you know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You get from, from lawyers, but you basically make sure transactions take place and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I think that's, I think that's right and you do a lot of negotiation but I, I, I don't think there's any endeavor period where you can get away from and not have to make judgments on integrity and on honesty and as a matter of fact I would say that one of the unfortunate developments over my career is it used to be because I do a lot of negotiations sitting across from, from people and talking to them about the transaction and who's gonna get what for paying how much and I would have to say that when I first started, you could have you know conversations, negotiations with people and by in large, you know, by in large everything was on the up-and-up.  And that what you were being told was the truth and you could you know you could generally verify it.  I would, I--my sense is that as the world has become perhaps even more materialistic over the last twenty years or so and less focused on professional responsibilities on integrity, people push a lot more into the category of you know just well, we were just saying that because of negotiations or it's just puffery or you know it's just a white lie or something like that in order to make you know a few more dollars and that there's you know we have to do an awful lot of work to check objectively what people are telling us because it has become you know accepted to stray in my opinion pretty far from the truth and it's kind of an interesting dynamic because no one wants to be lied to and there are very quickly up on their soap box if they are lied to, however, you know when they talk to someone else, they don't you know, they don't quite hold themselves to that you know strict of a standard.  I think that, that's been an unfortunate, unfortunate development.  I think that so many people measure their success by their money and not by necessarily by how they got their money that you know they're willing to shade things you know a fair amount.  And the first lesson that I learned that Wes [Wesley Walton] taught me was if, if you want a better practice, get a better class of client. That at the end of the day the clients who are disingenuous or who lack integrity, will compromise their lawyers as well and that if you want to you know if you wanna have the kind of practice that you're, that you're proud of you know get a you know as good a class of client as you would have.  Now some might say, well isn't it completely up to you how you practice, and once upon a time I used to say yes.  But then as I got out in the world and you see how, you see how not only do people kind of measure their success by how much money they have, but there are other people who even though they may be in a big firm for example, are literally on the verge let's say of being pushed out of the big firm or if they have their own practice, they're living kind of hand-to-mouth and you know people compromise in those scenarios and sometimes it's tough to--well I think for me it's tough to criticize them when they do compromise and I don't know the answer I would hope that I wouldn't but you know when you are under the stress of you know having to pay the bills, et cetera, people do, do tend to compromise.  And I think, I think that's too bad.
Story_ID: 296474
Speaker 1: I think probably the worst case scenario for a corporation is that Enron [Corporation, Houston, Texas] thing and that's--there're, there're probably a lots of examples recently of corporations going wrong and they seem to be like an aircraft carrier or a you know it's all going in one direction and everybody's on board and you got to--to turn that fellow it takes more than one person.
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact as as doing what I do and I think I probably would been in that respect doing the same thing you know since I started practice.  It is trying to hold people to you know hold people to a standard and get them to stay in the process because you know like an Enron or a WorldCom [MCI Inc., Ashburn, Virginia], it's not that honest people went to work one day and decided to become criminals, what happens is people respond to pressures and they start to deviate from you know their normal practices and their policies just a little bit every day, just a little bit every day and I think if you have a source you may end up firing him but at least he or she tried, but if you have a person who try every day tries to bring you back you know so that you don't drift away from your normal policies and practices because at WorldCom and Enron those were all smart people you know that were in those organizations, their audit committees, their board of directors were independent and certainly smart people, but they drifted a little bit each day and when you look at the comparison from you know day thirty-five to day thirty-six, that's not so much you know and day 157 to 158 that's not so much but when you look back from 158 to the start, that's a lot and it's just incremental.
Speaker 1: It takes you way off course.
Speaker 2: Way off course.
Speaker 1: Like the aircraft carrier we were talking about, it's thrifty.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  And, and the responsibility of folks like myself who you know are just very steady.  I mean we're just very steady and we try to keep people, keep pulling them back to you know the processes and the policies and the values that you know the profession or the corporation you know strives for.
Story_ID: 296475
Speaker 1: And given, given where I've come from I, I think I've been doing that all my life because when my parents [Maxine Embry Potter and James G. Potter, Sr.] were, were divorced, you know, when I was ten and my mom had to work and we didn't have anybody you know to come in, I was basically you know I would call--the father figure for for my brothers and I just gotten I always been in that mode of being you know the counselor or the father figure, parent figure you know seems like all the way from, from ten years old 'til now.  It's just something that I do kind of naturally and kind of you know pick up the responsibility for helping people you know make good judgment calls to help them balance you know a long term perspective and not get carried away with kind of you know things of the moment but also not you know to be fairly unflappable.  You know some might call it boring but I think even when I was at you know were up to Morgan, Lewis and Bockius [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], I think one of the things that surprised the partners the most and why I would get you know my responsibilities as early as I did was because even when partners would lose their composure and begin to yell or you know be drawn into some of the more negative activity when you're negotiating a deal, I typically wouldn't.  I'm just you know just maintain composure you know throughout the process.  And I think to some extent that's, that's personality to some extent that's you know discipline, quite frankly to some extent it's a bit of disconnectedness that you're not as you know as connected to you know whatever the downside may be whether it's you know you're gonna lose money or you're gonna lose position or lose prestige or sometimes that just doesn't when it doesn't mean as much to you you can be a little bit more composed about the issue.
Story_ID: 296476
Speaker 1: That's interesting because you came from a position--economic position certainly a lot lower than a lot of the people in corporate America and yet you say it doesn't--you know the some of the things that are at stake are not as big to you as they are to them.
Speaker 2: I think that the, the--certainly one of the most traumatic experiences that I've ever gone through was when you know my parents [Maxine Embry Potter and James G. Potter, Sr.] filed for bankruptcy and we lost our house and we kind of you know we were passed around from relatives for a little while until you know we were--my mother was able to from friends borrow enough to, to get us into a home for a while and so you know the trauma of that was I have an unnatural aversion to debt and, and, and actually that's kind of worked out you know I'm an avid saver, have an aversion to debt, but the thing that I think in U.S. society that has been my greatest strength is the lack of wants because I think if no matter how well you do, if your wants if you don't control those, the things that you want you invariably you know, you just you, you you can just spend, you can just keep on spending and never really catch up.  And my wants don't really run to material things.  I mean the things that I kind of want and and focus on have more to do with have more to do with family, have more to do with personal development, moral psychological, intellectual, development, trying to stay physically fit, eat healthy, trying to stay involved in the you know in the community, trying to things for people, tend to be more my wants and so I don't kind of chase down the you know the second homes or the boats you know I couldn't remember a great vacation spot.  I don't take very many vacations.  I should do more of that, but you know I don't have that kind of you know that kind of drive for those kinds of things.  But like I said it's kind of served me well.  It serves me well also in, in the corporation [Del Monte Corporation; Del Monte Foods, Inc., San Francisco, California] because you know I think if you look at some of these other examples and I'm not gonna call out the corporations' names but the general counsels have also been involved and as I may have indicated earlier you know if a general counsel is facing a decision and on one side of the decision he makes a $12 million bonus and on the other side of his decision he doesn't you know, $12 million gets that second home, it gets him bragging rights in the local golf club you know et cetera and people can say what they want to but if those things are meaningful to them it's shades how they you know how they practice in my opinion.  And I'm frequently reminded by some of my you know the executives that I have worked with when I make a call you know do you understand how this call impacts your, your stock options or your performance shares?  The first thing I say is no.  I have no idea how it impacts them and nor do I care because it's not relevant to the decision that I'm making, what the personal financial impact is and I think and again I think it's and a little bit too bad that our profession and people in general have gotten so focused on material things being the measure of your success as opposed to your profession, how do you feel about what you're doing, do you think you're doing you know the right thing and maybe you're not, you know, maybe you're not gonna have all the material things that you ever wanted to have but are you gonna be comfortable that you have done a good job over the course of your career or that you behaved like you know, you know a thinking, feeling human being over the course of your life or career.
Story_ID: 296477
Speaker 1: It's interesting that you were a philosophy minor at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  I don't know are there many lawyers that you met that have been philosophy majors?
Speaker 2: They were not, there were probably one or two but I think they ultimately get out of the business.  It's something being in this business is kind of hard to line up and stay I think you know philosophical about things.  But I--so I do think they tend to get out of the business and go into something that you know that they can relate to a little bit more.  But I would say that there are but there are plenty of good lawyers who, who you know have a broader picture and a broader perspective who have not and who but don't have a philosophical backgrounds.  I think the real challenge that the profession is facing though is that you know the kids go into law firms making $200,000, New York [New York] law firms making $200,000.  They see opportunities to go to corporations to make even more than that.  But those opportunities are gonna be based on you know initially their technical skills and for example, how well they might negotiate a transaction and some lawyers--I've worked with some lawyers that have shaded the truth so long that I don't think they know any more.  They have developed these great skills to create reality in their own minds out of the words they use not realizing that reality is this thing over here that may be different from the words you use and there are some lawyers for example, major partners in big New York law firms who I will not do business with because they simply don't understand that you don't create reality through your words, you're supposed to be reflecting it.  And but these are the same lawyers who you know are very proud of of their material things.  And at the end of the day in some respects it's a little bit perverse because they look at--it's, it's like cheating in, in any game.  I mean everybody wants to win at the game.  They want to be recognized as a winner but what they're missing is if you cheat to win and people know about that, then you haven't actually won and you shouldn't be recognized as, as a winner.  It's kind of this perverse thing so in a number of negotiations that you can have even at the very highest level, you can be dealing with Fortune 500 companies there is a certain amount of disingenuousness as people try to win but they don't you know--winning doesn't mean cheating, winning means playing the game according to the rules and, and being better at you know at the overall skills of the game.  But a lot of that's been lost I think.  Because people have become so focused purely on winning and the things that go go along with that.
Speaker 1: You think things are getting any better with all the scandal in the news about you know business scandals?  Do you think things are getting--are starting to turn around?  Or is it too soon to tell?
Speaker 2: No, well here's what I think, I think that I think that there are a lot of processes and procedures that are being built in to the way corporations do business and to some extent the way lawyers practice and that sort of thing.  But I think that so many corporations look at those processes as being burdensome or onerous because they don't think it you know the problem could apply to them or the problem could appear in their businesses.  They have this you know stylized notion of WorldCom [MCI Inc., Ashburn, Virginia] or an Enron [Enron Corporation, Houston, Texas] of those were just criminals and we're not criminals so all this process that we have to conform to is really burdensome because it is irrelevant but what it is in my opinion, they don't understand what actually happened in a WorldCom and Enron and those you know sorts of environments could happen anywhere once people get under pressure because it's when you're under pressure to hit that next quarterly number if you're a public company or when you're under pressure to deliver you know the proceeds of, of a transaction if you're gonna sell assets or you're under pressure to bring on assets from, from another company, people start slipping a little bit you know as I said day by day and before long they are are in the situation actually it could be long, it could be a couple of years, but I think the tough thing about it is that people really don't view--my sense is that most corporations don't view the new processes that have come on in the last couple of years as relevant to them because those situations could never happen in this country--in their company and I think they're fundamentally wrong on that.  Pressures will make you know good people do slip, will make them slip away by degrees.

Speaker 1: But the other thing I'd have to say is that my generation of lawyer probably caught the tail end of the generation of lawyers who looked at it as a, you know, strictly as a profession not as a money making activity.  When I was at Morgan [Morgan, Lewis and Bockius, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] one of the things that was more fascinating to me was there was a partner who was perhaps a couple of years away from retiring and I was maybe in my fourth or fifth, fourth year or so and I did the first commercial paper offering by the State of Pennsylvania and so I was going out to Harrisburg [Pennsylvania] to actually close that transaction I think it was about a quarter of a billion, half a billion dollars but because it was the first time the State of Pennsylvania had ever issued commercial paper, I had to take the partner with me.  You know he would sign all the firm's opinions et cetera and I was dreading it because in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] they have something called the Main Line and that's where all the old money is from and this partner had come from the Main Line and he'd come in to Morgan Lewis and you know was an old line partner, wore the bow ties and the whole nine yards and I'm thinking--and it's a two hour two and a half hour drive to Pittsburgh--to Harrisburg from Philadelphia and I'm thinking, what in the world are we gonna talk about you know for two and a half hours as you do this drive.  You know in my profession you learn to make small talk but two and a half hours that's a long time and we had to do that drive I think four times before we finally because we did that first commercial paper offering and then we did a couple more.  But maybe five times total we drove back and forth two and a half hours each way so we had five hours so many twenty-five hours in the car.  After the first trip I looked forward to those drives you know every chance they came around because what you got was you know from somebody a year or two away from retiring what the practice used to be like and how lawyers used to advise clients and just the class you know that a good lawyer brought to a situation and I think that is the piece that I got the tail end of it and it was only by chance that you know I got exposed to something that I didn't want to be exposed to and, but it's a true dilemma because these are the same folks that brought, in my opinion they brought so much class to the profession but these are the same folks that were exclusionary you know they didn't allow women, Jewish people, certainly no people of color into the profession.  The first African American in the Morgan Lewis came in 1975 and it's just, it's like everything else, it's so complex and complicated and you just can't have a knee jerk reaction because this guy he was going out of his way as a matter of fact both to train me, give me what the profession used to be like and also to pave the way for me to do further work with the, with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania so and the conversations were easy.  So it wasn't as if you know here was a person who you know had a problem you know talking with an African American male from two generations basically away and the things I learned from him just about you know the class of the profession how, how to practice with class I thought were invaluable and as I said looked to--I looked forward to those drives but Morgan Lewis and I don't mean to single them out because I think they are representative of most firms you know did not let, did not diversify in any significant fashion until the mid-'70s [1970s].  And it's you know it's a hard thing to kind of, kind of integrate.
Story_ID: 296479
Speaker 1: Now did you want to become a partner with Morgan Lewis [Morgan, Lewis and Bockius, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: The world began to change; the short answer is went in yes.  I went in in 1984 but the world went through some rapid changes in, in the '80s [1980s] they get--partner David O'Brien that was his name he retired.  In his stead was a group of partners in their forties who were all about the money and every partner wanted to take home a million dollars, to take home a million dollars they had this called leverage, they had to work their associates you know all hours of the day and night, basically had to give the associates like myself you know projects to run because it was very cost efficient to have me at my billing run a project with several other associates it was very cost effective for the partners.  So there began you know this thing about especially at the large law firms everybody wanted to make a million bucks and that was all about to some extent that was status, that was competition but what began to happen was the billable hour numbers you know ran way up, the demands were there, you became very isolated, very focused I should say in what you did.  I did leverage buyouts.  I just them one right after another, non-stop and then and so I saw essentially the--my profession focusing in you know on a very small point but the documentation beneath that point becoming you know more and more extensive.  I knew how to do my negotiations in my sleep.  But decided, I decided not--I left the firm, and I left the firm you know for two reasons.  The first was actually maybe three, the first was all my classmates left you know all my classmates left to go to firm--I'm sorry not firms--but companies where at that time they made more money you know with stock options, et cetera, they got out of the law altogether.  They wanted to be writers or they wanted to to you know do a host of other things other than practice law.  They'd been demoralized by it but you know the last piece was looking at the existing partnership and they just didn't look happy.  They didn't have a lot of connections with each other.  I think somewhere along the way firms got away from being sort of a collective group that had some connection to each other to basically a bunch of attorneys who were looking to each other to you know to make money.
Story_ID: 296480
Speaker 1: How did you get involved with Prudential [The Prudential Insurance Company of America; Prudential Financial, Inc., Newark, New Jersey], what happened?
Speaker 2: At- at the end of the day, at Morgan Lewis [Morgan, Lewis and Bockius, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] I think I departed because I didn't see me forming connections with the, with the partners.  The world--the law firm world is kind of sterile.  Most law firms are fairly sterile and so I had just by by coincidence our next door neighbor was a executive search person and she stopped over one evening to say we were talking about a host of things but she asked me if I--what kind of law I did and I said well it's shaded now to banking and securities work.  You know her ears kind of picked up at the banking reference and she said well she was working on a project for Prudential who wanted to get into the retail banking business and would I be interested in talking with them?  And I, and I was, I was interested.  I was interested because it would allow me to vary my practice.  It would allow me to work with you know a single client and it also would allow me to get onto the, on to the management side.  And so went up and talked with talked with Prudential, liked the idea.  They were basically assembling a team of executives to go build their retail banking business.  The commute was gonna be a bear.  I was gonna be commuting from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] to Newark, New Jersey on a daily basis.  But with the, with the trains I decided to give it a shot and moved to--moved up to Prudential, stayed in the same housing situation, but moved to Prudential in 1989.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How long a commute was it?
Speaker 2: Two hours.  If you took the train it was two hours. I ended up driving at some point when we moved out to Doylestown [Pennsylvania] from Malcas Park [ph.] and it turned about an hour and a half, sixty-three miles one way.  So fortunately though when you drove the--you could really go on, on the highway 78 [Interstate 78] quite fast, so you covered sixty-three miles.  Sixty-three miles is a long drive and you know again one of the things that people do these days is commuting you know sort of outrageous times cuts into family time et cetera but it was a great opportunity to go and, and to build the business and to start shading away from the pure technical practice of law to the more business you know business driven practice of law.
Story_ID: 296481
Speaker 1: You were at Prudential [The Prudential Insurance Company of America; Prudential Financial, Inc., Newark, New Jersey] for quite a while.
Speaker 2: I was at Prudential for eight years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Eight years and it was truly a mixed, it was a mixed bag.  I really enjoyed the banking work with Prudential.  I, I really had a tough time integrating into the overall Prudential Insurance, Insurance Company you learn--I learned valuable lessons but you know tough ones.  I think you come out of, you come out of a law firm and you think you know pretty much everything and law firms in some respects are like professional sports teams and that is that you know the politics can only get so bad because you know for example on a football team you know you may have you know two, two athletes who want to be the star or the starting running back but if you've only got you know one slot for a running back at the end of the day, you got--you know you have to put in your best person and you try to put in somebody else you know for politics or whatever you know sort of driving that and the other team doesn't care too much about it and they run right over that person and sooner or later you have to put up your best talent.  Law firms kind of work that way as well.  I mean you may have you know friendly or political connections within the law firm but at the end of the day if you don't produce the work you don't do a great job for your client, that's not gonna work.  Corporations are a bit different.  In, in corporations I think the you know the political aspect the fact that a lot of that is not on the front lines with delivering the product to the consumer allow for a lot more machinations and et cetera and you know I really wasn't prepared to handle that as, as best I might and then I also think that in corporations at least in some corporations there is that generation, there is that generation of folks who still operate on, on sort of stereotypes.  One of the things that you may you know may come across as you talk to more lawyers is that the way the market has worked for a while, is that very good attorneys from you know from the schools like a Harvard [Harvard Law School, Cambridge Massachusetts] or a Stanford [Stanford Law School, Stanford, California] or whatever, especially women and attorneys of color, but either became disillusioned with law firms or you know for one reason or another disengaged, but they were picked up by or went in-house to you know various corporations but to see that dynamic because it's sort of fascinating if you you know were to pick a law department at a major corporation what you might see is that the white male associates came from you know good solid law schools but not the top you know what's recognized as the top tier.  Prudential is kind of funny at the time because if I'm not mistaken every single person of color in the law department came from Harvard you know.  Other people could not be hired or I don't know what the issue was, but it was an interesting kind of thing that that was the standard that each of the people of color had to get over, but not, you know, the rest of the department.
Story_ID: 296482
Speaker 1: It was a learning experience but a complete mixed bag and each day presented a positive and a negative [at The Prudential Insurance Company of America; Prudential Financial, Inc., Newark, New Jersey]. My banking clients were in Atlanta, Georgia so when I you know showed up as their general counsel that was an interesting dynamic as well because many of the people were from from Atlanta and had spent all of their lives in the South from one fashion or another.  And it was you know it was the first instance of an, of a set of circumstances that I would have to repeat you know in each place that I would go.  Actually including going into the law firms because there is you have to prove yourself and I'm, I'm not one who's really pushed back too hard on that because I haven't really found it a challenge to prove myself you know in each of the spots that I've gone into but I think it is interesting, there are differences around the country and I think going into the Atlanta operation was you know was perhaps a challenge, one of the largest challenge.  I will say though once everybody came on board, that was probably the most supportive environment that I've been in.  It's an interesting dynamic I think they--the initial stereotypical reaction is to, to think that you know the person of color is not confident and can't do the job but once that's disproven then you become super confident.  You know the smartest person they've ever seen.  You know the hardest worker that ever lived and so you benefit if you get over the hurdle.  You tend to benefit disproportionately whereas before the hurdle you were probably disadvantaged disproportionately.  But I've seen that to be true at, at a number of places.
Story_ID: 296483
Speaker 1: The Prudential [The Prudential Insurance Company of America; Prudential Financial, Inc., Newark, New Jersey] experience was--I think it helped shape me on the corporate side. It--and sort, and sort of you know showed you some of the skills that you had to have to succeed in a corporation and I think it focused, it focused an issue for me and that is you can play some of the games and you could probably play them better and better means winning you know there's a lot of they call it backstabbing and you know that kind of stuff (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Swimming with sharks and all that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: --exactly.  It goes on with corporations and initially you start in on that because everyone is doing it and you because you know you got a little bit of horse power you can think of ways to undermine people, you know, that are very effective and devious and I think it was at some point after I'd been there for a year or two and I kind of moved down that route, I don't know what it was but it just caused me to stop and think you know is this, is this really who you wanna become?  Is this how you really want to succeed?  And I had to stop and say no that this is not what I want to do even though I could do it better, even though I can figure out you know more ways to undermine somebody or to demonstrate that they did not know what they were talking about and those sorts of things.  You get to the point of you know is that really what you wanna do?  And one of the questions I've never really able to been--to never been able to answer is what is the tougher thing to do?  Is it tougher to you know get what you want at all costs, is that a demonstration of just how dedicated you are?  Or is it tougher to say you know I'm not going to reach something and I want to achieve because you know in order to get that I would have to do things that I'm just not comfortable doing.  And I debated this with people on you know both sides and as a matter of fact it came up when people were going for partner at, at Morgan Lewis [Morgan, Lewis and Bockius, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] because I remember female attorney who they passed over and in my opinion it was you know inappropriate that they passed her over and had the conversation and she said well you know I'm just gonna stay here and do whatever they ask me to do until I make you know until they make me partner.  And I said well yeah but the things--first of all you should be outraged that they passed you over because the reasons were bogus and second of all you're gonna do anything they ask you to do to make partner?  And her response was yes because that's you know, that shows my dedication to reaching the, the goal.  And and in some respects you know I faced some of the same issue you know at, at, at Prudential and decided that you know I, I don't think it's for me, I don't think it's the hardest thing to do is to do whatever you know has to be done to reach a particular goal or a particular promotion.  I think it's more important that you know if you got principles around some things that you know you let those actually guide your, guide your behavior but honestly I'm not sure that I know the answer of which is the tougher thing to do but you face--I face that question at, at Prudential.  And when I think about that that overall experience I, I come away with that and I come away with how unfortunate it is that sometimes--this happened to some folks that I was close with--how sometimes people get blamed.  Everything--you know something goes wrong in the company, somebody has to get blamed and how unfortunate it is that most often the people that take the brunt you know of the blame have--had nothing to do with the actual you know decisions or the problems that, that arose.  It's just that the way corporations work you know sometimes that falls to you know falls to the wrong people, very unfortunate.
Story_ID: 296484
Speaker 1: When did you get an opportunity to leave Prudential [The Prudential Insurance Company of America; Prudential Financial, Inc., Newark, New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: Prudential got to the point where it ultimately sold, sold the banks.  It ran into issues on the insurance side of the house and on the brokerage side of the house and you know needed, needed money to various class actions et cetera that--and for, for other reasons I'm sure strategic reasons focusing on core competence whatever but at the end of the day decided to sell the banking business.  And I'll never forget that.  We closed that sale on my fortieth birthday.  We closed it in New York [New York] and so I think after we sold the assets, the credit card assets in particular, I went this little cafe right across the street from the museum of art and so on my fortieth birthday I sat out there for an entire afternoon thinking you know I just sold off the thing that was you know the biggest part of my career and that I enjoyed most doing.  Because we took the bank [Prudential Savings Bank] from basically $50 million in assets to $2 billion in assets from twenty-eight people to over a thousand people and then sold it and, and I was--it took eight years to do that and you know I was just sitting there contemplating that that's probably the only time I'm gonna ever be able to do that and it's over.  And what do I do now?  Because I really didn't wanna work at the overall insurance company and so I decided I spend all of I guess it was no more than a month or so before another opportunity came up at Provident [Provident Mutual Life Insurance Company; Nationwide Life Insurance Company of America, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], which was basically to go into that organization and prepare it for to become a public company.  So and it wasn't hard to see because I'd been at Prudential really just to do the banking business and when that was gone, a number of my friends had already left so when that was gone, you know it was pretty straightforward to move on.
Story_ID: 296485
Speaker 1: So you were at Prudential [The Prudential Insurance Company of America; Prudential Financial, Inc., Newark, New Jersey] from--
Speaker 2: About eight years.
Speaker 1: --about eight years from?
Speaker 2: From '89 [1989] to '97 [1997].
Speaker 1: Eighty-nine [1989] to ninety--so okay so you went there from Provident [Provident Mutual Life Insurance Company; Nationwide Life Insurance Company of America, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Provident, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what happened at Provident?
Speaker 2: Provident was an, was an interesting opportunity because it was a--Provident like a lot of insurance companies was a mutual company which meant it was owned by its policyholders and the idea was to take that company public and to do that you basically had to change the culture to get it much more focused on what it means to be a public company, what it means to deliver numbers on a quarterly basis that sort of thing.  And the CEO there built a team that he thought would come in and change the, change the company around and what Provident taught me was the ups and downs of class action litigation because in trying to go through those various transactions we were besieged by class actions and, and ultimately you know it didn't succeed but the opportunity there was to go in and essentially developed or redeveloped actually the law department.  I got responsibilities for the human resources department, got responsibilities for the compliance department so I was able to broaden in those areas as well as as well as the compliance function.  There was an interesting, it was an interesting connect too because I was interviewing with the CEO and was talking to him about rebuilding these departments, I was talking to him about his products et cetera and, and had finished asking all the questions that I was gonna ask and he said, "Well you haven't asked me anything about the conversion."  And I said, "Well the conversion is going from mutual to you know a stock company."  And I said, "Well I think I pretty well understand it. I used to convert banks, mutual banks, in the '80s [1980s] I converted them to public companies and the insurance provision is very similar to the, to the, the bank provision."  And he said, "Yes but do you understand how much money the executives will make when we are converted in the form of stock?"  Said, "No I hadn't really thought about that at all but," I said, you know, "I assume that it will be substantial."  And he said, "Well you've got the job." And he said, "Because all the other candidates for this position, that was the first question they asked," you know.  How are the conversion worked, how much options, how much stock do you expect to go to the executive team and he said, "You are gonna walk out of this interview and never even raised the topic."  And he was right about that, but the reason was because I was so much more interested in what the business was gonna be and looking to grow the business, who I was gonna be working with and you know looking to rebuild departments and functions.  And that always struck me as kind of an interesting conversation because the people who are so focused on the compensation that was gonna come from the position don't get the position and the person who you now I didn't you know I kind of knew that those things flew through but they weren't important.  I mean what was important here was the, was the company and was the development.
Story_ID: 296486
Speaker 1: And he, he assembled a very interesting team [at Provident Mutual Life Insurance Company; Nationwide Life Insurance Company of America, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]. We had a person from Iran was our chief information officer, there was myself as the general counsel, we had a woman from Jamaica who was our chief operating officer so we had a very diverse team in a lot of ways and a lot of ways I wished that opportunity had lasted longer but at the end of the day, the class action sort of defeated the overall transaction and, and the company was sold to, company was sold to Nationwide [Financial Services, Inc., Columbus, Ohio] and that just was not not something that I was gonna do so disengaged.  But I enjoyed that opportunity.  I--people are, people are fascinating because I would say I never heard that CEO say one word about diversity, about inclusiveness, about equal opportunity.  Never heard him say one word and yet he had the most diverse executive team that I've ever been on and that I ever expect to be on, which is kind of fascinating to me.
Speaker 2: Well he pulled together from scratch from what you--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yes he did.
Speaker 2: --so that gave him an opportunity to--
Speaker 1: That did give him an opportunity but he could have just as easily and especially when he knew how much you know of his own compensation that was at stake you might have thought he would have kind of a stereotypical response and say you know I want this, this, this, and this person all looking the same, all you know resonating with with him and yet he went out and built a team that you know he had no idea other than his interviews how they would work together, how confident they were or anything like that.  That's always fascinating because never once I never, I worked with him for three years, never heard the word diversity, never hear the word inclusive, never heard equal opportunity, never heard him get up on a soap box and talk about you know the issues.  He just did it.  And there was you know there was never--you know sometimes when people do those things, they kind of pat themselves on the back you know look how I demonstrated my commitment et cetera, but I want you to notice that I've done you know and I wanna be congratulated for this, not one word.  That to me was, I mean that's true when it's just built into the way you do things and it's unremarkable that to me is you know showing a genuine commitment and, and for him it was just unremarkable the people that he pulled together because he thought he'd pulled together you know people who could you know do the best job for, do the best job for the company and he looked across you know anybody who he thought he could do, could do that for him.
Speaker 2: Okay, now what was his name?
Speaker 1: Bob Kloss, Robert Kloss.
Speaker 2: Kloss, K-L-
Speaker 1: O-S-S.
Speaker 2: K-L-O-S-S okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 296487
Speaker 1: So you go from Provident [Mutual Life Insurance Company; Nationwide Life Insurance Company of America, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] to Del Monte [Corporation; Del Monte Foods, Inc., San Francisco, California], right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Del Monte.
Speaker 1: Now what year are we now here, what's this?
Speaker 2: We are now at 19--no 2000, in 2000.
Speaker 1: In 2000 okay.
Speaker 2: And I'd have to say 'cause this, this was a personal decision so I'll have to give you a little bit of family background as to why that made sense.  My son Jameson [Potter] was born in 1986.  I have a daughter Lauren [Potter], who was born in 1990.  In October of 1990, Jameson was diagnosed as autistic.  And that really shaped a lot of what we did going forward because my my positions have always been such that as long as I got the work done you know, I could structure my own schedule.  So you know we structured things like you know taking him to occupational therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, speech therapists, et cetera and you know to, to, to alleviate as many of the symptoms you know from--of autism as we could.  But one of the things that we were facing as all parents face in that situation, is what happens when you're gone?  And we looked at you know I was, I was at Provident, my wife [Myrtle Stephens Potter] was an executive at--my wife at the time was an executive at Bristol-Myers [Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York, New York] and she got an opportunity to go to work for Genentech [Inc.] in San Francisco [California] and we really kind of looked at you know what were the options, what were the options or the likelihood that working at each of our two kind of standard jobs we would be able to create the kind of wealth for Jameson that would carry him through you know for as long as possible and decided that the potential for Genentech you know to grow, it's a biotech company and stock et cetera, was better than our two positions on the East Coast.  So in 2000 we made the decision to give up you know both those jobs and she accepted a job at Genentech that really drove it and then I came along and basically switched industries and went from financial service industries to, to Del Monte, the consumer packaged good industry.  So it was really driven by you know and we're very fortunate that it has worked out that way.  Genentech has done fabulously but it was really driven by you know the need to prepare you know for taking care of our son you know for as long as that has to happen.  And I suppose I could have, there not as many financial services positions in San Francisco.  I suppose I could have you know found something in that area, but I was, I was ready to get out of the financial services businesses and get into something perhaps more tangible and you know at the end of the day it's hard to be more wholesome than you know Del Monte's products.

Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All the canned vegetables and fruits--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --and fresh pineapples other things.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, so, so you became--you rose pretty quickly, you're now senior vice president (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) President.
Speaker 1: --and general counsel for Del Monte Foods.  I think that just occurred just 2002 I think?
Speaker 2: Right, I went in and I--the different industries value their lawyers differently.  Financial services values those lawyers, values their lawyers intensively because they're regulated intensively.  Consumer packaged goods like Del Monte you know has a certain value for the lawyers because they're not regulated as intensively.  I went in at a time when Del Monte was just about to go into the most major transaction it's had for quite a while.  Bought about $2 billion worth of Heinz' [H.J. Heinz Company, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] business.  And it was really that, that was a bit of a fortune for me because it played to my strengths.  I mean my strengths are in you know mergers, acquisitions, securities work so I was able to go into the company in October of '01 [2001] immediately get involved in you know a major transaction in the spring of say of '02 [2002] and so I was promoted from vice president to senior vice president within about nine, ten months of arriving.  And you know it's been, it's, it's been a great opportunity because they were able to to use--I was able to use my strengths.  They were able to benefit from that and I was able to go into an industry which that doesn't really happen a lot the, the lawyers get to cross industries a lot and, and it's actually worked out very well, worked out very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were really involved in that transaction--that transfer from that--the merger of part of Heinz?
Speaker 2: Right.  But it's, it's one of those interesting stories that you know how you kind of get on with a position or get on with a company because I had mentioned the conversation I had with the CEO at Provident [Mutual Life Insurance Company; Nationwide Life Insurance Company of America, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], the conversation I had with the CEO of Del Monte you might have thought would have been either about the law or about business or about some intersection of those but really what it was was about revitalizing departments because at the time he was you know going through the final stages of revitalizing his sales department and I just turned over a number of departments at Provident so we spent you know just a couple of hours talking about how do you, you know turn a department around to you know to achieve what the new things that you wanted to achieve and how do you keep some people on and actually some people are gonna go away and other people you have to terminate which nobody likes to do.  So it was, it was that experience at Provident that I really talked with them about.  Again just more of you know more of a conversation about you know that management aspect and that he--I think they told me that he'd interviewed everybody in the industry within a knowledge of the industry and had not decided to go forward with them and you know I sat down and talked with him with no industry knowledge but you know just talking to him about managing through some of those kind of change items.  And you know they offered me the job the next day.  So I think that you know it's kind of interesting how you get you know from position to position but at the end of the day one of the things that I picked up from a partner Jerry Blaner [ph.] at Morgan Lewis [Morgan, Lewis and Bockius, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and that was every opportunity is an opportunity to you know learn if you take advantage of it learn something from it, take something away you never know you know when it's going to help you out in some fashion.

Speaker 1: We were just talking about the size of a tuna you know that StarKist is one of Del Monte [Del Monte Corporation; Del Monte Foods, Inc., San Francisco, California] brands that's a big--tunas are huge.  You were saying you were starting I mean--you're saying you kept too many big ones you said.
Speaker 2: Yeah I was just saying that the--and I don't know if it's overfishing or what, but the size of the tuna is coming down and so you know that obviously requires us to catch a lot more but it's just kind of a mixed scientific issue right now as to whether the overall size will be coming down long term, but they're big and they're fast and you know the--I was actually surprised as well when you know we process them in Samoa, Ecuador, Thailand, but fascinating business, fascinating business.
Speaker 1: It's an international business too--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --when you think about that, that's you, know you just named quite a few places I wasn't--I didn't know Del Monte--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --was in those places, this is so.
Speaker 2: Well a lot of the business.  A lot of the business now is I know there is some talk today about you know exporting- exporting jobs, but you know pineapples are primarily from Philippines, peaches from China, a lot of the, a lot of the business that we have is overseas now.  Tomatoes are still strong in California and vegetables in the Midwest, pears and apples in Washington, but a lot of other things are coming in from overseas.
Speaker 1: Yeah, like, Del Monte does Contadina tomato--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --paste and so--yeah.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Story_ID: 296490
Speaker 1: At Del Monte [Del Monte Corporation; Del Monte Foods, Inc., San Francisco, California] what does--now you do--not only do you do corporate law stuff which you seem to now have gained notoriety as a expert on diversity on some level too in corporate America now from a couple things I was reading on the internet, can you tell us about that?
Speaker 2: The--one of the things that I really wanted to make a change when I changed jobs, was that I thought that my career up to this point up to the point at Provident [Provident Mutual Life Insurance Company; Nationwide Life Insurance Company of America, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] I'd become too narrow.  I think a lot of lawyers we let our friends fall away, we let our commitments to pro bono fall away you know over time, we let our connections to the community fall away and we let our connections to you know spirituality fall away.  You know over time it's sad but it's true that we've become so isolated and so focused on our profession that all these things fall away because we don't give them any time.  When I went to Del Monte you know I decided that I was gonna become more involved in the community.  I was gonna become more involved in the profession and professional aspects, professional responsibility and I was gonna do what I could you know to become more connected you know spiritually.  And so you know before Del Monte filled up my plate with all the responsibilities that I knew would draw me back in to a very narrow existence, I joined things, like the Minority Corporate Counsel Association [MCCA] or the California Minority Counsel Program [CMCP] and joined the board and the steering committee of those institutions and and you know took more of a--it's really just more of being vocal and sort of out front about things that I had always been doing you know in, in my practice which was to diversify my law department, to try to make them as inclusive as as possible in whatever definition you gave to diversity because I, I view inclusiveness really just more of providing a legitimate equal opportunity for people to succeed based on what they can contribute to the, to the department and I think that that's important within the department and then you become very focused on the outside counsel that all you know law departments employ and you know if you look at the statistics, the statistics certainly have not improved and in some ways have gone down if you look at you know the top 250 law firms in the country, this is now 2005 but less than 4 percent of their partners are people of color.  The pipeline is, is horrible.  The pipeline of, of kids coming you know out of law school into the law firms of kids coming out of college into, into law, into the law schools and so you know I have become, I've actually become knowledgeable first of all about you know the kinds of things that have resulted in you know the very low numbers at, at law firms and trying to help law firms think about the problem.  I've become you know one of the companies in addition now to let's say a Walmart [Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., Bentonville, Arkansas] or a or a DuPont [E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, Wilmington, Delaware] or a Sara Lee [Sara Lee Corporation; Hillshire Brands Co., Downers Grove, Illinois] that has been very straightforward about we will retain--one of our criteria for retaining firms is your diversity and your inclusiveness and your programs around that and one of our criteria for once you've been retained the amount of business that we give to you increasing or decreasing again one of the criteria being you know how you're progressing on diversity and inclusiveness, measures and, and programs.  Because I think it's you know to me it's disappointing and it's almost galling that the very profession that should be at the forefront of equal opportunity of promoting the principles that are in the [U.S.] Constitution should be as far behind as we are I mean accountants, physicians, all have much better percentages than big law firms or even big law departments and so you can't argue that it's an issue of hard work, you can't argue that it's an issue of intelligence or intellectual horse power there's something else going on in our profession in the law firms and the law departments that in my opinion is not giving people fair opportunity.  And so yes, I've, I've been vocal about that.  I write about that.  I hope to write more about that although I get invited to sit on a lot of panels with respect to securities, law and corporate governance et cetera, I generally will not accept you know that you know those, those opportunities and and stay pretty focused on the diversity inclusiveness issue.  Again I think that, that has become more my commitment to the profession.
Story_ID: 296491
Speaker 1: I do a fair amount of community outreach, I'm working with the Coalition to Promote Minority Health which has been formed up over the last couple of years because I think that's critical that people, especially people of color start to focus on nutrition, on their diet, on physical activity because we're killing ourselves very quickly by what we eat, and by our lack of inactivity.
Speaker 2: Does that kind of reflect back to when you were a dialysis technician with some of the stuff you saw?
Speaker 1: I think that you know if you've actually seen kidney failure, you would understand you know how disabling a chronic disease is, like diabetes.  I mean we're putting together a whole host of cures, but diabetes is one result of obesity.  I mean there are so many so many things that are impacted by obesity you know depression is tied to it.  You know even things like you are 70 percent more likely to have knee surgery if you are obese than if you aren't and we don't, we don't know these facts and, and we certainly haven't you know focused the way we should on nutrition and on activity and on what we're setting our kids up for and it's kids that are most important because their obesity rates are growing yearly which is just incredible, they're growing yearly so you can get to a statistical position where you know by the next couple of decades at the most everybody on a statistical basis is gonna be overweight which means that you're running the you know cancer and diabetes a whole host of things that will just crush the health system but health system, other people think that's probably very important.  My focus is the people.  You know as I try to tell my own kids [Jameson Potter and Lauren Potter] who are not you know a lot different from the other kids the thing about, the thing about being in good shape is not so much the diseases that you avoid when you get older, it's that you are in the prime time for enjoying your body right now.  You will never be able to run faster than you run now, you will never be able to swim better or to ride horses and to get the joy of being in great shape, I mean it truly is a joy and you will never be able to experience, experience that the way you can now so if you're out of shape now but you get into shape when you're my age, when you're forty-eight or fifty it's not gonna mean the same thing because I can't run nearly as fast at forty-eight as I could at you know at twenty-eight and, and some people say I don't even understand that.  Hit the runner's high you know.  The runner's high is just, is just an absolute enjoyment of your body in action and that's one, it's just a great feeling. I--you know I tell people that it's been shown that you can treat depression with daily physical activity as well as if you were to give them Zoloft.  Don't mean to mention any names there but it's, it's been shown and, and--but there's such a difference between daily physical activity and taking a pill and so much goes to you know the psychological aspects of being in shape versus being obese, so I really tried to push into that and on the community service side.  I think I've done a--I think I've done a fair job on, on the professional side with the diversity and inclusiveness and I gotta do a lot more than I hope to.  You know I'm working on the community side with the obesity issue but I think that's a long pull and, and a lot of people are gonna have to get involved in it.  I don't, I don't think I done near as well on the spiritual connection side.  That's just tougher to get to.
Story_ID: 296492
Speaker 1: We always ask this, now, what, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community and then you start with the spiritual side of it and is that your own personal concern or is it you think that it's a bigger concern than that?
Speaker 2: I think my overall concerns are you know think that I you know I guess the things that I stress with my kids [Jameson Potter and Lauren Potter] are the things I'm probably most concerned about.  You know I'm concerned that we need to be sure that we counter the immediate driven impression of us you know the, you know the shows like 'Cops' where you know they're running us down all the time you know and yelling at us to get on the ground and every other criminal is a black you know is a black male.
Speaker 1: It's amazing how those young black men get caught on the cops.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You wouldn't think that the cops that are chasing can catch them but they can.
Speaker 2: That is fascinating to me.
Speaker 1: The jails are full now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Full.
Speaker 1: --now so.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I think, I think you know although there are some writers and others that would tell us that you know my generation is now out of it and that you know the world has changed and the media has changed.  You know you look at the scenes you know coming out of New Orleans [Louisiana] you know after the Hurricane Katrina and you really don't you know it's hard to imagine that the world has changed a whole lot from what I believe.  Certainly not to the, not to the utopia that might or the color blind society that some people would have us so I think it's about you know we have to counter the continuous negative bombardment that we get from, from the rest society to build our, to build our own confidence, self-confidence and otherwise we need to cooperate more to pool our financial resources.  You know I'm not personally an entrepreneur.  You know I work best in a big, a big company with you know all the things that kind of go with that but more of us need to be you know small business people or entrepreneurs and really want you know really be in that business.  I mean I'm surprised how many of us kind of dabble in real estate but it really is just kind of dabbling as opposed to you know being in some of the tech businesses and some of the other services business and just generally helping each other out.  And I think to some extent that is a, is a, is a symptom of the things that we're bombarded with from media that you know we don't have as much trust and perhaps comfort level with each other, but I think that that's something that you know that we need to work through. Because I think our, our key issues are you know economics.  Too many people in poverty, education, you know the public schools are not now what the public schools were when I was a kid and without education you know it's hard to crack that poverty, poverty issue.  So economics, education and then the nutrition/obesity issue because you know our numbers are horrific when it comes to that if you look at you know just for example black females over the age of twenty-five.  I think the percentage of those who are overweight is north of 90 percent which is just a horrific number.  But it stems from a whole host of things, that's the time.  You know you could, you could pull that number apart and you would see that a lot of that is psychologically driven, you know it's depression, it's eating because you're depressed you know and there are plenty of reasons to be depressed.  So you're not gonna tackle that group by just talking nutrition because it's--that's not the issue.  When you pull apart those percentages you know you find that it is those things.  It is those things you know it's depression, it's economics, it's being in a rural community and kind of disconnected from you know what is good nutrition for example.  So I kind of look at those things and say we really need to you know find ways become more involved in the economy, to become more involved in education in building good schools and understanding the value in today's society of education and then become more involved with our own health.  I watch The History Channel [History] every so often and I remember they did a thing on California in talking about how when California was settled, that the, you know, the essentially the Native Americans were herded you know onto reservations, had something to do also with religion as they tried to convert them, but there was a line that one of the priest said was that you know once they got onto these reservations are under the control of the priests, he said that they got fat, they got sick and they died.  And you know if you kind of look at our population you know it's a generalization to be sure but you know that's what happens.
Story_ID: 296493
Speaker 1: What are your future plans? Now, you're a senior vice president now for an international corporation [Del Monte Corporation; Del Monte Foods, Inc., San Francisco, California], where do you go from here?
Speaker 2: You know that's an interesting question.  Because I think at the end of the day, at the end of the day I'm probably going to come out of the law and come out of the, come out of corporate world you know at, at some point because I think there is a couple of things.  I think there's good work that can be done you know both professionally and personally inside the corporation and certainly some issues that can be moved like you know diversity and inclusiveness, corporations being more responsible you know citizens, being more connected to their communities.  And so I think it's important for people who have those kinds of thoughts and motivations to be in corporations and, and, and you know to work that process.  So I, I think that's important and that's one of the things that I enjoy about my position and will certainly keep me in the corporate world for a while, but the other side of that is it seems like no matter where we look, we need solid you know people with you know a host of skills doing a whole host of different things.  And so for example on the nutrition side, or on health of the overall community, black community and people of color community in particular, I think we need you know we need to mobilize a major effort.  And I can see myself moving out of the corporate world you know to do something there because you're already taught the language of corporations, you're already kind of presentable, you know how to work that process, how to interact with government officials, how to fundraise, how to move projects along you know and I think that those kinds of projects can benefit those kind of issues can benefit from people who you know got the experience and the skills that I do and I think I probably would get more out of that from just a personal perspective than I do you know in working in a corporation.  So I actually think that you know you get to my age now and you start thinking about well what am I gonna do when I'm fifty-five or what am I gonna do when I'm sixty.  And I'm not one of those people whose gonna be playing golf and I'm not gonna retire to you know a summer home or a winter home or anything like that.  I'm gonna have to work at something and so I, I at this stage I'm fairly confident it's gonna be working at something like that.  You know the real challenge of it is some of the problems seem so intractable.  I'm the kind of person that you know in a corporation you have tough problems, you have tough challenges, but you can mobilize the forces and it might be a two year project, it might be a five year project, but in your mind you can see how it's gonna get done and you execute or you direct somebody else's execution.  It'll be interesting to see how you react or how I react when the problem is as broad and as complex and as long term as let's say the obesity problem.  And I'm sure the people who started you know twenty or thirty years ago with the tobacco problem couldn't see you know the end and just had to kind of labor away and a lot of things came together and I think that there has been a lot of good work done there.  But I think that's, that's gonna be my biggest challenge with something you know as as intractable as, as tough as let's say the obesity problem because in my head I'm not gonna be able to imagine that the problem is actually (unclear).  You know mother's coming home at night or father's coming home at night and making sure that their kids have nutritious meals, making sure their kids aren't watching TV you know for five hours while they're eating corn chips or other things you know that seems like a tough thing because I was a parent of two young kids [Jameson Potter and Lauren Potter] as well.  When you get home at night you know it's tough not to say stop bothering me, you guys go watch TV and by the way here's a pizza you know it's tough to do that but those are the kinds of changes that are gonna have to happen if we're going to master the problem.  But that's kind of where I see myself I mean tackling something like that that I think has meaning to overall society to people of color, to the--and to America just generally but tackling or understanding that I could get to be seventy-five and the problem is you know still a tough one.
Story_ID: 296494
Speaker 1: So you have some things to do but--still in the future--but at this stage in your life, what would you consider to be at this moment your legacy?
Speaker 2: You know I look, I look at that this way, I read somewhere that the the definition of a great man is to do a thousand kindnesses anonymously and, and in a lot of ways that's what I'm really comfortable with.  I mean I'm comfortable with the things that I have done.  I mean if you talk to people about what I've done in corporations, I think the thing that a lot of people would focus on is that I achieve or try to achieve fair treatment of employees, fair treatment of consumers, fair treatment of other you know constituencies and that I've you know I've put my own job on the line you know talking with the--arguing with--various CEOs you know to make sure that that happens.  I think that you know there are a lot of things that a lot of time and a lot of money that I contribute but only to see or try to see that things get done that I think will help you know people who have been, had been or are disadvantaged by your system or particular set of circumstances because I just think that that's what I should be doing.  So you know if, if legacy was an issue, I think it's, it's modeling a certain behavior that is again designed to you know show people the benefits of, of hard work, of ethical conduct without ever really talking about those because I rarely talk about you know ethical conduct, of being able to trust you know themselves and other people and I don't ever talk about that.  It's just you know you try to model that behavior for other people to see and if they want to model it, or if they want to do it themselves then they can.  And to show them that you can be successful you can be successful by you know following the rules, by being honest, by playing the game straight and I think that's if you, if you talk to people that's probably what you would come away with.  I mean the guy plays the game straight and sometimes in this society you know the benefits don't flow to you from that, sometimes you have to work very hard if you play the grain [sic. game] straight to be successful and very lucky.  But at the end of the day and this is kind of where I ended up I think the first time I went in-house that's what I'm most comfortable doing, playing the game straight.  If you win, you win--if you win you've legitimately won and you can be proud of that.  If you lose you've lost but you know you played the game straight and I'm gonna always do that.  And that's what I, you know that what's what I bring, that's what I try to model. Model that for the kids and for you know the people that I work with that you know you don't, you don't have to bend the rules, you don't have to go outside of them.  If they're wrong you can change them, but there's generally a process, a process for doing that as well.  And it is the, you know I think it's, it's the generosity without wanting to be recognized for that.  It's the whole host of things that you can do not looking to the recognition or the reward and say you know I'm comfortable with that.  Because that's hard to do in the U.S. and U.S. we are so consumed with the peoples and the ETs ['Entertainment Tonight'] and the you know all of these things that everybody wants recognition you know coverage, media, et cetera, just to kind of labor away and say you know that's I'm more about the substance and you know the recognition may either come or not but at the end of the day that's, that's not what you're looking for, you're looking for a thousand kindnesses done anonymously.
Story_ID: 296495
Speaker 1: You made reference to your family but what's your family like?
Speaker 2: Well my family, well (laughter) it is, it is today's family I suppose.  My ex [Myrtle Stephens Potter] and I were married for nineteen years, divorced about four years ago.  My son, Jameson [Potter], as I said was born in 1990, I'm sorry 1986, diagnosed as artistic in '90 [1990], my daughter born in '90 [1990].  Kids are currently fifteen and eighteen.  Lauren [Potter] is a gifted student at probably the best girl school in the country right now but certainly in California and Jameson was able to finish up high school and has started with community college near, near Woodside, California.  You know and I think family is one of those things that people in my position we kind of wish we had done more.  You wished that you had spent more time with your family, more time you know working with Jameson's disability, but that's you know, you're young, you don't know, you know, you don't know then what you know now and how you should, how you should apportion your time and but I get along well with my, my kids and you know they're teenagers now so that can be a challenge.  They tell me all the things they think I've never thought of and I got to tell them that maybe I thought of that once upon a time, maybe I can offer you some insights and maybe I can't because the world has changed and they're working in a different environment.  But you know I've got, I've got great kids and I think that's--they're gonna work out just fine.
Speaker 1: Now are your parents still alive?
Speaker 2: My mother [Maxine Embry Potter] is.  My mother is seventy-nine will be eighty in February.  My father [James G. Potter, Sr.] died in '77 [1977] my adoptive father died in '77 [1977].  So and she's fairly frail now but, but we pay for a nurses to come in so that she doesn't have to go into a nursing home.  She's lost most of her speech at this point but I got her a laptop three years ago and she's learned that and she shoots--she probably has emails on my system now that I need to respond to so that's worked out really well for her.
Speaker 1: Is she still in Richmond [Indiana]?
Speaker 2: She is in Richmond, never left Richmond.  Got to Richmond and never left it and you know like I said it's a different generation.  Grew up--essentially grew up essentially grew up and spent her life in Richmond for a long while surrounded by, by her cousins and relatives.
Story_ID: 296496
Speaker 1: As we sit here today there's a historic reunion of black Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] graduates going on right outside of these walls, how do you feel about that and what's been your participation in this?
Speaker 2: The--how I feel about it is I think it's, it's encouraging and by in large it's very encouraging to see the--actually the legacy of the law school and the students that you know have left the school, have gone on to work in large law firms, have gone on to work in corporations but also the ones who have gone on to work in charities and in foundations you know in the entertainment industry, in media, have gone on to become members of parliament.  I mean to me that's fascinating and it speaks to you know the school's draw in the beginning to bring the students and then when the students come out you know how well prepared they are to do something because as you can hear from that laundry list I gave you know a number of them are no longer in the legal profession.
Speaker 1: And some are no longer--I mean they're not even from the United States.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: You said members of parliament those--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --these are people in in the United Kingdom or the Caribbean or--
Speaker 2: In England in particular and so I think that that's and then just the camaraderie that develops I think is very good.  So I think those are all very good things that come out of the session.  I actually was here, was invited to come speak on a panel of general counsel from Fortune 500 companies and that was an historic panel because it was one of the I think the first time at the law school that they had had four African American general counsel from Fortune 500 companies to sit on a panel and talk about primarily legal/business issues.  So it wasn't on any particular social issue, but on legal issues and I think it's good idea reinforces for everybody else in attendance you know just where you know we have gotten you know as far as different various different positions but also just how diverse the areas are that that we have gone into.  And then there's just the general social--socializing that I think is good and sort of the rebuilding, the rekindling of you know the spirit of community so I think it's been a great activity probably do it every five years.  I think the fascinating thing is that I wish more people you know there's always that dynamic of reunions so you know people wanna come back who believe that they have done something and the people who perhaps don't believe that they have done as much don't wanna come back, I think it would be great if everybody came back or as many people as possible because it really is all about you know seeing people, building the connections and the network, and just you know relating to people as people because we all do have at least three years you know in--of common experience that have, that have shaped us.
Speaker 1: I guess as we're speaking now the Senator Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] as the only black senator in the country, who is speaking out there.
Story_ID: 296497
Speaker 1: Is there anything we haven't asked you that we need to ask before I ask my final question?
Speaker 2: No, I, I, I don't think there's anything you've asked.  It's sort of interesting that, you know you sit here and you kind of talk about you know you talk about your life and, and you know the things that you've gone through and what has made you into who you are and where you're gonna kind of go and it strikes me as that if you talk, if you talk to anybody on the one hand, if you talk to anybody and hear the things that they have gone through, you realize how special everyone is but then when you back that up and say well maybe though that means we're all not kind of not special either.  Because it's just kind of fascinating to me when I, when I sit and talk with people and hear what they've gone through, especially 'cause my son [Jameson Potter] is autistic, I have an opportunity to sit down and talk with parents whose children are disabled and I've always thought that how fortunate I've been that we've had financial resources you know to assist our, our son.  I think of the, I think of you know the poor black, single mothers who I've interacted with who have in some cases two, you know, severely autistic kids and nobody ever tells their story and you know they don't get interviewed and they don't get positively written up but you know I mean if you were talk about whose really you know carrying a heavy weight in this life, I think it's them.  So you know I, I don't think there's anything that that you asked or haven't that I would go into it, just as I said I don't think my story is that special.  I think some people would say you know you come through a lot of things and been successful.  But I'm not so sure it's you know it is that special.  I do think that you know the way the country kind of looks at things and with the focus of the media, we lose sight of the people you know who are really carrying tremendous weight who through the course of their lives you know have learned an awful lot about living, an awful lot about life and I wish sometimes that more of their stories would get told.
Story_ID: 296498
Speaker 1: Our last question is similar to legacy but it's a little different.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: My overall personality is such that--again it may be perverse.  I'd have to put that into context of whose doing the remembering.  Because by in large to be blunt I don't particularly care if the vast majority of people either know about me or remember me but I think--and I know that they're gonna be people who you know remember me you know I fired half the attorneys for example that have ever worked for me and I know they're gonna remember me as, as someone who you know misjudged their contribution or their performance, but how would I like to be remembered?  I think if it was my mom [Maxine Embry Potter] doing the remembering, I want her to remember that you know I took to heart you know the key lessons that that she tried to teach me and that you know by that I mean I actually put it into practice and you know took care of you know people that I should have taken care of and model behavior for my children that she would be proud that you know I modeled.  For my kids [Jameson Potter and Lauren Potter] I think I would like to be you know remembered that you know of trying to do the best job that I could at being a father and you know of, of really wishing the best for them and trying to make sacrifices you know as you go through life to support them and to to have things really work out for them.  And then I supposed you know for my siblings and, and for other I think it would just be you know that as I said that he was a person who was a straight shooter.  You could always count on him and you know he was there to support us when we needed it.  And you know past that I'm not too concerned with you know how I get, how I get remembered because I think it's remembered by and this is another thing that I believe, it's remembered by people who had some reason to know, who had actually knowledge.  I think there are lot of things out there in this world where you know people will get remembered because of the media and otherwise for things that they never or for being you know the kind of person that they never were because it's created that they were you benevolent that they were thoughtful, that they were this or they were that but it's all the people who knew them would say that was never the case and so that's kind of again the dilemma, the dynamic of our media and how we create images and we create people.  So my, my hope is that the people who actually know me who are in the position to have some real facts to base it on would say that you know at the end of the day the guy was you know hard worker, straight shooter and you could count on him when the game got hard.
