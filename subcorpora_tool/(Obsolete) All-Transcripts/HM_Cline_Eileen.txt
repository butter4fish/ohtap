Speaker 1: Hickley, Hickey.
Speaker 2: Hickey.
Speaker 1: I'm, I'm getting--I always used Scott Stearns, so Matthew Hickey, the videographer, and we're The HistoryMakers.  So, I will just start by having you say your name and spelling it out for us.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Do you want my middle name?
Speaker 1: Yes, entire name.
Speaker 2: I'm Eileen Boleyn (laughter) Tate Cline [HistoryMaker Eileen Cline].  And I--nobody knows why in the world my parents [Inez Duke Tate and Herman Tate] would give me a middle name after this woman [Anne Boleyn] who walked around with her head tucked underneath her arm (laughter), but that's what it was.
Speaker 1: So, spell that for me, with your name.
Speaker 2: The whole name, Eileen is E-I-L-E-E-N, Boleyn, Boleyn--I guess it is--B-O-L-E-Y-N, took us a while to figure out, to settle on a spelling; Tate, T-A-T-E, Cline, C-L-I-N-E.

Speaker 2: I'm, I'm retired, a retired educator, okay--
Speaker 1: A retired music educator?
Speaker 2: --yeah, I'm a retired music educator, but educator--I think, more than music.  Music happens to be a tool--
Speaker 1: In which you use--
Speaker 2: --for what I believe in, in terms of, of helping the world be a better place.  I think it's the best tool I know of.  But that's because I know how to do it to some extent.

Story_ID: 443700
Speaker 1: We're going to continue.  We're going to start with your background, your family tree, from your point of view.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, let's start with your mother, your mother's name, your mother's date of birth, and place of birth.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Inez Duke [Inez Duke Tate], and I think she was born in Chicago [Illinois] in 1910.  And she had two younger brothers, one of whom is still living in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: Just tell me your earliest memories of your mother.  What do you remember about her as a child?
Speaker 2: My earliest memories of, memories of my mother were her singing lullabies to me.  I can still remember them.  And also the fact that she was a teacher, and she was a really dedicated teacher, and that she would never give up on a child.  Those were really things that I remember very much.  She taught in what was already then a very tough school down in either, farther, farther north in Chicago than we lived, when we lived in the Rosenwald building [Rosenwald Apartments; Michigan Boulevard Apartments, Chicago, Illinois].  And I remember her saying--I remember one child in particular that she would sort of grieve over because he was supposed to be so bad, and nobody wanted to be bothered with him, and she would just stick with him.  And she would say to me, "You know, being a teacher, or just being a person, it's very important to realize that the most important things you share with people, you may not see the results.  And so, don't count on seeing the results.  You have to do what you know is right, know it with your heart.  It has to be a giving thing, and then you just let God take care of the rest."  And that was a very helpful thing to me when I later became a teacher, but just in my life.  And one of the most wonderful things was when I was in my first year of teaching--I was teaching in Gary, Indiana, and I had gone home for the weekend.  And there was a knock on the door, and this young man in a, in an [U.S.] Army uniform was standing there.  And he said, "Is Mrs. Tate there?"  And I said, "Let me go get her." So I went to get her.  And he said, "You know, Mrs. Tate, you won't remember me, but I'm--," and then, he mentioned the name of this little boy that I had known, I had heard these horror stories about.  And I'm just kind of standing there.  And he said, you know--and he was just telling her how there was a point in his life, that it hadn't been too long before that, where he said, "I remembered what you told me, and it saved my life."  And that was a wonderful thing to me because I already understood what she was talking about, is that you have to do what you know is the right thing, the loving thing, the thing that's going to help people grow and be strong, even if they don't understand it.  But she said, "Someday, they will understand it."  It needs to be there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Where did she grow up?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Where did you mother grow up?
Speaker 2: I think in Chicago.  I'm not the one who paid a whole lot of attention to that.  I was, more than anything, a certain part, I was interested in, in the present.  And another reason I, I will say, one of the things that she shared with me, other than the sort of social structures that sort of come and go--some people are popular, and some are not and so on and--and that she wanted to always be beyond that.  And I remember she used to say that it's one thing if you revere your ancestors and--and but we knew lots of people who really thought they were somebody because their daddy or their granddaddy was somebody, and that kind of thing.  And she said, if--and both of my parents were strong, and they said, if you base who you are on those people's accomplishments, then you also have to accept all the negative things that are in everybody's family.  So, they said the most important thing is what kind of person are you going to be?  And my dad [Herman Tate] used to say--I talked to him more until after he died, and then my mother became a really good friend.  But I was an adult then, but I wasn't as interested in her.
Speaker 1: Why not?
Speaker 2: Because she was my mother.  I mean, you know, she was a lovely woman, but she was not terribly forceful, but she was so strong.  She was just like, she would never let go of an ideal, or something that she understood.  But she had not grown up as being a particularly assertive person.  But she had some real great inner strengths.
Story_ID: 443701
Speaker 1: The thing, is because I was such a kind of an oddity growing up, and my father understood me.  I just remember thinking from the time I was three years old that he knew who I was inside.  Even--you know, children can't say things in grown-up terms anywhere near as soon as they can understand them.  And he seemed, all along, to understand what was in my thought and, and helping me grow myself.  So, that was important to me and, and it helped me sort of--yeah, there were things, like when I was seven years old--and he must have given my mother [Inez Duke Tate] a heart attack any number of times, because we lived way out south [in Chicago, Illinois], and he had to take me downtown to do something about my eyeglasses.  But he worked at the post office downtown, and there was no way for him to get me home and back.  And so, I was seven and we discussed it, and he put me on a Rock Island  train [Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad] by myself.  And he knew--see, this is the thing--he knew that--he trusted that I was intelligent, and then I could figure things out.  And that was another one of the most important things in my life.  He knew I knew where to get off the train.  We had done it before together.  And it was like half a block from the school that I went to.  So, I didn't think anything of it.  I figured if my father knew that I could get on the train and go home, and get myself home, then I could do.  And so, I did, and it was no problem at all.
Speaker 2: What was your father's name and where was he born?  What's his (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) His name was Herman Tate, and he was born in Saltillo, Arkansas which doesn't exist anymore.  It's outside of Conway [Arkansas].  And he was the seventh of ten children.
Speaker 2: What's his date of birth?
Speaker 1: Nineteen o'seven [1907], I think, November 22nd, 1907, 1907.
Story_ID: 443702
Speaker 1: Although Amy [Cline's sister, HistoryMaker Amy Tate Billingsley] probably has filled in a lot of details about your ancestors and your family origin, I--do you have any recollection of sort of stories in the family that have been passed on from generation to generation?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, a lot.  And, and the interesting thing is for me, it was maybe because my paternal grandmother lived with us--.
Speaker 1: Can you give me her name and--.
Speaker 2: Salina Amy--Salina Amy Harris Weaver Tate Vesey [Salina Harris Vesey].  She was one of nineteen children from a family in Durham, North Carolina, and her mother actually raised fourteen of them.  I mean, can you imagine that in that time?  And she was a very gentle and very loving person, but also, again, a very strong one.  And she outlived three husbands and she had ten children.  And Amy is one who remembers this, in particular, that, you know, people talk about stepchildren and everything.  It never occurred to me that my father's [Herman Tate] brothers and sisters were not all just his brothers and sisters.  And, and I never thought about it until maybe about ten years ago actually when Amy said something about Grandma Vesey having said something to her about there are no steps in this family (laughter). It's just, you know, my children and my children.  And also, another important thing, and that was the part of the family that I felt particularly close to because they often came.  My father was sort of the person they all gravitated toward since he was the only one who had gone to school.  And he kind of--he was the one they'd come to for advice.  And they would come, and we'd all work in the garden, and then we'd all can.  You know, when everybody got all excited about canning back in the '60s [1960s] and stuff, and I'd look at them.  And they'd say, "Aren't you interested in this?"  And I'd say, "I don't care if I never can anything again (laughter)."  I said, the hours that we spend in the kitchen, I said, you were doing your different kind of middle-class thing.  We were canning and feeding ourselves.  Oh, I've, I've lost the story that I was going to tell about that.  Well, anyway, they all came and, and we worked the garden and, and then, we harvested the garden.
Story_ID: 443703
Speaker 1: And another important thing to me around that time was that, like during World War II [WWII], when we were feeding ourselves, and we ended up feeding half the neighborhood [Morgan Park, Chicago, Illinois].  And it was interesting that, you know, everybody had their Victory Gardens and things like that.  But I remember one year, in particular, that was significant, and people's beans were not bearing very well.  And we had beans, and my father [Herman Tate] would give them away.  And it was as if the more he gave to people, the more we had.  And that was kind of his belief, you know, you give, and it doesn't hurt you, you know, and the more you give, the more you have.  And I saw that over and over and over again.  And I heard it articulated, and that was, again, I think something that was very shaping.  Another thing I'm thinking of as, as being a shaping thing was living in a neighborhood, like we did, where everybody lived there.  I mean, you didn't have just middle-class people, or just poor people, or just rich people.  I mean, there were more well-off--I mean, there was a whole enclave of what--farther down in Chicago [Illinois], what I used to call those who imagine themselves to be W.E.B. Du Bois' Talented Tenth.  Wonderful people, though, but I think because I was kind of the wallflower kind, and I was sort of--you know, I would sit and observe things while everybody else was all in the middle of things.  And I wasn't in the middle of things a lot, so I noticed things sometimes that some kids didn't.  And I didn't like it, that it seemed to me that nobody could be really all that great if they were unkind to other people.  And we, of course, lived then where--I should say we didn't live on the other side of the railroad tracks.  We lived between two railroad tracks.  We lived between the Rock Island [Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad] line and the Pennsylvania Railroad, and it came to a, a pie shape at the end.  Then there were times you can't, couldn't get home until you just sat and waited until a hundred and fifty car train went by.  I climbed over one once that was sitting there across the road.  And I, and I noticed when I came up on the streetcar that the engine was unhooked.  Now, they could have hooked it up for all I knew.  But then, but I just, I was that kind of an adventurous child.  And I threw my books through, you know, so I wouldn't have to carry them, and climbed (laughter) over the coupling, and got myself home.  I think I would try anything.
Speaker 2: Well, let's, let's just do this, because Amy [Cline's sister, HistoryMaker Amy Tate Billingsley] has filled in a lot of your family's background, and you feel that, that she knew more, that, that was her area of expertise.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Let's talk about your own personal memories of growing up in Chicago.
Speaker 1: This is part of it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 443704
Speaker 1: Let's just start with the earliest memories you have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --of growing up in Chicago [Illinois].  And tell me the street you lived on, just those (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.  We lived at 4629 Wabash Avenue in the Rosenwald building [Rosenwald Apartments; Michigan Boulevard Apartments, Chicago, Illinois], and we lived there until 1941, I think.  I was six, almost seven.  And we built a house out in Morgan Park [Chicago, Illinois] so that we--we had two lots, and we built it so we could have a room for my [paternal] grandmother [Salina Harris Vesey] to live with us.  And so that we could garden, and which was good timing because that was right about the beginning of World War II [WWII].  And we fed ourselves, we, you know, worked our garden.  I can tell you every plant, every vegetable, all the ones that I liked, the ones I didn't like, the ones that--I hate to cultivate tomatoes.  They're very hard to do, but I loved to eat them.  I loved to cultivate corn, because once you really got the weeds out and you understood where the, the root, the root system that worked was, you didn't have to worry about them so much.  You know, things, things like that.  And another thing that I remember about--and we lived on 109th Street and Loomis [Street], 109th Street right near Loomis.  I remember most of the people in the neighborhood but, you know, when you're the kid (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who were some of the people in the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Well, the Spielmans [ph.] lived next door, one family of Spielmans lived next door, and there were two other families in particular.  And then, some more Spielmans who lived up the street, and were kids our age that we sort of grew up with as teenagers.  And there were a couple of other families whose mothers also were teachers, the Wallaces [ph.] and the Dixons [ph.].  And we--but our house was sort of a, when we first moved there, I think there may have been three or four brick houses on our street that had indoor plumbing.  You know, the whole area was really a mix.  And what was wonderful about it was that when you had people coming from all kinds of economic backgrounds, all kinds of what you call, I guess, cultural backgrounds, all black, you learn something about what fundamental character is.  And that it's not a function of--oh, and there was the black Sheres [ph.] on the next street, and the Pratts [ph.], and Willie Wilson [ph.]--I mean, just, the Peals [ph.]--but it was important to me to know that good character is good character, and selfishness is selfishness, and caring about other people is caring about other people.
Story_ID: 443705
Speaker 1: When you were a child, when you--how did your mother [Inez Duke Tate] and father [Herman Tate]--how did they describe good character to you?  How was it defined to you?  How did you know what good character was?
Speaker 2: By example.
Speaker 1: What examples did (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think it was, it was very clear that--I remember my dad talking about an honest man.  All right, here are a couple of character things, I suppose. Because they were good people.  And they helped people, and they kind of--this is what they were interested in.  They didn't--I remember noticing when I was a young teenager that they didn't go, just doing things that would please them, virtual--and yet, it pleased them, yet, it pleased them to teach.  It pleased them to do good things for people.  It pleased them to share what they had.  It pleased them to think about, how can the world be better?  And they always included us in it.
Speaker 1: Well, let's, let me ask you this.  What did your mother do for a living, and what did your father do for a living at this time?
Speaker 2: Oh, my mother taught elementary school, and my father worked in the post office.  He also had a second job that was related to his chemistry major at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  With a friend, they started a chemical company because he didn't have the social contacts and, and all those things that a country boy wouldn't have in a place like Chicago [Illinois], which in its own way, was kind of a closed social circle.  So, he didn't have those kinds of contacts to develop a business.  But they were doing pretty well with it.  And then, he had a major heart attack when I was seven.  And the doctor said you can't keep working two jobs and since that one was in--not a dependable income, he kept his post office job.
Story_ID: 443706
Speaker 1: So, you were in a household where both your parents [Inez Duke Tate and Herman Tate] worked.  Both had professional jobs.  How did you see your parents at that time as a child?  You saw them as what?  Were they your role models?  Did you look up to them?  Did you want to be like your mom?
Speaker 2: No, I did not want to be like my mother because my mother was short.  I thought, at the time, that she was kind of a sissy 'cause I was a tomboy and I was tall.  And I wanted to--I mean, I loved her, but I thought she was kind of too, I don't know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Prissy?
Speaker 2: --just didn't, didn't--no, she wasn't prissy at all.  But, you know, she was my mother, and she was, she had very clear values.  We knew, you know, how to behave (laughter), and how not to behave.  But she just didn't interest me a whole lot, but I did love her.
Speaker 1: What--
Speaker 2: And she was a teacher in our school, which was another thing.  It's difficult for children, but I was very proud of her because she was the first person who really, for instance, taught Negro history, as they called it then.  And they used to call her Citizenship Sal [ph.] because she really was very firm about what makes good citizens.  And, yes, I really revered her that way.  But it's just that it was my father that I was interested in because he, he sort of--I knew that he wanted a boy, but he had two girls [Cline and her sister, HistoryMaker Amy Tate Billingsley].  So, I was going to be my father's boy and I was--I could roller skate like you can't believe.  I was a demon on roller skates.  I--he taught me how to play softball.  You know, I could do, I was very athletic, and I could run like crazy.  As a matter of fact, the former Olympic guy, Ira Murchison, was in school with me and, of course, Ira wasn't as tall as me, but I could beat Ira Murchison running around the, this little pool we used to run around at school.  And it was, it was the encouragement to grow beyond the confines of what we would see as maybe was the railroad tracks or whatever.  I never felt, in my heart, I was never going to be confined.  And that's an important thing I think of growing up.
Story_ID: 443707
Speaker 1: As far as the neighborhood was concerned, a lot of what I learned is that when you live around people, a lot of whom are having a really hard time; and a lot of people in your family, and in your extended family, who are having a really hard time, or who've had really difficult experiences-- which is why I won't go to upsetting movies, for instance.  Why--you want--you mean, you're just protecting yourself.  I said, I've hardly seen anything that doesn't depict something in which I know the people, so that's not entertainment for me, you know.  I mean, I went with school with, with Hudson Tillman and Paul Crump who wrote 'Burn, Killer, Burn.'  But when I saw some of the older people, or sometimes younger people, having a really hard time, I remember thinking, you know, it's like people will just hold on, and hold on, and hold on.  And it's like, I'll hold on as long as I can, and I'll just have to give up.  And somehow, in a person's heart, it's like, you know, if you give up, it's going to feel better.  But I will watch people give up and realize that it didn't make it better.  That was one of the most important things in my life--is it--giving up doesn't make it better.
Story_ID: 443708
Speaker 1: You said that your mother [Inez Duke Tate] was one of the first to teach Negro history?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: How important was Negro history at home?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was part of life.  You know, to me, what she was doing was that she was helping to teach the other kids who didn't know any of that--what was just sort of part of our lives.  We heard, you know, we heard the world and its issues discussed at home all the time.  And my dad's [Herman Tate] post office buddies would come, and I remember thinking, this world is crazy because here you have all of these educated, intelligent, wonderful-hearted black guys who loved their country, who believed in democracy, who believed in all these things.  And it's like the world didn't even respect them, or know that they were there.  But they had a sense of self-respect and a sense of worth, and a sense of determination to ultimately make a difference.  And I think they did.  I mean, I have friends who are--I have a Scandinavian friend in Santa Barbara [California] who said to me, her uncle was like the manager of the camp [Circle Pines Center, Delton, Michigan] that we all went to.  And she said to me about twenty years ago, she said, you know, your father was probably the most influential person in my life.  She said, of all the things--and she's, she became really wonderful in her field, and a real helper in things, and very effective.  And she said, I used to watch him in meetings, you know, where everybody would be arguing about things.  And they would, you know, have all these issues to decide.  And he would sit there, and he would listen.  And then, he would say just a few things that somehow he seemed to be able to understand everybody's--where everybody was coming from, and articulated in such a way that people could see the commonality, and they would find a solution.  And she said that was the most important model for my whole life.  And she became somebody who did that kind of thing. So that when I was asked to give a, a keynote talk at a, at a big conference in, in Oregon in 1995, I titled it, My Father Never Told Me or A View from This Bridge.  I think I always considered--I guess I think of myself as a bridge builder, a bridge spanner because, like my Grandpa Duke [Charles Duke] was a bridge builder, technic--I mean, he was a civil engineer who did all those things.  And Amy [Cline's sister, HistoryMaker Amy Tate Billingsley] has found that we had a whole part of our family who were down in, in somewhere in Alabama, I'm particularizing, who were the artisans and the builders of things on the plantations.  And my father was a different kind of bridge builder, you know.  He, he understood the insides of people, and my mother understood the insides of people.  And I remember that one of his favorite books was the book, 'Brothers Under the Skin' [Carey McWilliams].  And that there was something fundamental to humankind of all kinds of things that it was really important to understand.  And he seemed to be able to do that.  And my life has been very much about that because I didn't feel that there was any place that I should not be able to go, and be who I am.  I have never felt like, in my heart, a minority in this country.  I keep thinking, this is my country (laughter), you know, I mean, it couldn't have been built without me, you know, in a--rhetorically speaking.  And I don't--I, I think that one of the most difficult things that we deal with all over the world is this concept of the other. You know, that there's those folks, and there's those folks, and those are good, and those are not good, or whatever.  And I think that throughout history, from the time of Cain and Abel, that has been the fundamental destructive factor, you know, that, that when people get in the corner and they say, them over there.  And I think that, that somewhere along, we keep struggling.  You know, Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] understood that, you know, Gandhi [Mahatma Gandhi], revered the world over for his nonviolent philosophy of passive resistance understood that.  I think Mandela [Nelson Mandela] understands it, that until we really understand who we all are, we'll keep struggling with that which will probably be forever.  But at least we can keep making some kind of progress which means recognizing--I think this is a character thing, recognizing and respecting the good, the honest, the caring, the productive; recognizing that and celebrating it wherever you find it. Refusing to be fooled by what would say that you're not.
Story_ID: 443709
Speaker 1: What was-in the household?  Did you live in a political household? Did your mom [Inez Duke Tate] and dad [Herman Tate] and the post man, talk politics?
Speaker 2: Oh, all the time.
Speaker 1: What--do you remember--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But, but, it wasn't political the way your generation things of political.
Speaker 1: How was it; explain it to me (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was just the way you lived. Well, it's because we were black people in a world that was still very vocal about your not being as good as we are. So that if you were educated at all and if your values went beyond the material--I think this is another thing that is important--is that there are so many different kinds of values. I mean, there are some people who through their families forever have been interested in what they could get. It's not that that's bad--it's just that what their--you know, do I live in a really nice house; can I wear really nice clothes; am I important? I think to us that was a by-product of being--what was more important is what kind of--I've said this before I guess, keep coming--what kind of a contribution can you make to the world. How can the world be a better place because you were in it.
Speaker 1: We'll pause (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And that's the most important thing I would say if I had to pin-point one sense of a character thing for my family, that was it.
Story_ID: 443710
Speaker 1: --Opinion of the, of the war [World War II, WWII], 1941, you were, you were six years old.  Did he tell you that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't think it was an opinion so much as--I mean, you, you, your country was your country.  I think they--everybody was very patriotic.  We all hunkered down in the, in the halls where we thought there might be an air raid.  We did air raid drills.  You didn't know (unclear) that.  Oh, man, you know, you went out, and you hunkered down by your locker when the air raid sirens went on, even though we were in Chicago [Illinois] in the middle of the country.  It was a very interesting time.
Speaker 1: Matthew [Matthew Hickey], just let me know when you're ready.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE) We have speed. Sorry, I got that question on tape.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, let's continue.  You were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was, it was a big thing.  So, I guess I think of, I think of history writ large because we all felt part of history.  And we all felt that as you get educated, and you find the way to give to the rest of the world, things will move along, and that you--I think I always was taught not to accept limitations.
Speaker 1: Well, where do you think--I mean, you told me what your father [Herman Tate] said--ask not what you can do for your country, you know, that, where do you think--and this is the late '30s [1930s], early '40s [1940s]--where do you think your father got that from to relate it to you as a child?
Speaker 2: Probably, probably a lot he heard from the guys around and/or his boarding, boarding house table when he was a teenager.  And all these guys from the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] used to come there, and people then that he met when he was in college, and my mother's [Inez Duke Tate], you know, all of her family and friends.  And you, you didn't, you know, then you, you didn't have the luxury of sort of sitting back to kind of just have a good time for yourself.  You know, everybody was trying to make things better, and they had different ideas of what made things better.  A lot of it had to do with philosophical things that they read.  I mean, I have a--what I'm--we're working on down there, I have a library that has sixty boxes of books down there that I've got to get shelved.  And they are all important to me.  And I have them all catalogued on a database, so you can find--I mean if you ever want to, just to look at the kinds of things that we have from back when they were growing up, and people who were always involved in education.  So, it was a pastiche.  Everybody was, was involved.

Speaker 1: I'm interested in the role, role, religion played in your life--I'm interested in the God of your childhood.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, let's say that to me, religion was so much a part of everyday life and not an organizational issue.  And this is something that, again, is an important part of my attitude toward things now and, and how I deal with things now.  I remember that my grandmother had a wonderful book of bible stories that she was--she loved, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Which grandmother?
Speaker 2: My Grandmother Vesey [Salina Harris Vesey] who, who lived with us.  And she couldn't really read terribly well, but she could read the Bible.  And, and I remember the pictures, you know, with the halos around Jesus' head and, and figuring out which people had halos, and which didn't, and so on.  And I think her background was Baptist.  My father [Herman Tate] was not terribly religious in an organizational sense because he said (laughter), he said that when he was growing up, you know, the minister used to come, and everybody would feed the minister on Sundays.  He'd go around.  And, and it would upset him because, you know, if he sat next to him here, you know, and, and they would pass the food around.  And the minister didn't think--he didn't think twice about taking the last piece of chicken, you know.  And these little hungry kids sitting there, you know, wanting another piece of chicken.  But he just used to tell some funny stories about that.  And also, another one that is, to me, religious--but, but the two things about their, their growing up that really affected my thought.  One was that, that he said, you have to get beyond just what a particular church might say. Because he said (laughter) he went down--there's the church they had down there, was on stilts.  And he said--I mean, that people would get so happy, and they would be rocking and everything.  And he said, he was curious.  And preacher's up there just going like crazy.  And he said, this little--he is a little boy; he goes down this (unclear), what is this preacher saying?  I thought about this when I read [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou's account of what went on--that he says, he gets right up under the preacher.  And he says, he swears.  My father was so funny.  He said, and he was saying, "A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J," (unclear), I mean, I say.  He said, "I swear that man was saying the alphabet."  And he just would have us rolling, laughing, but it was his (laughter) way of saying that your religion and your God has to be in your heart, that it's not a question of who you just go out and try to proselytize or whatever.
Story_ID: 443712
Speaker 1: Well, when we lived in Morgan Park [Chicago, Illinois]--actually before we got to Morgan Park--an interesting thing is this business about my not being supposed to live, was that when my mother [Inez Duke Tate] was little, she was, you know, a youngster, and her two younger brothers.  Her mother  got--heard about Christian Science, and got interested in it.  She thought it sounded really interesting 'cause people were getting healed and stuff.  And so, she took her three children to a Christian Science Sunday school in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, just--can you start again and let--and who were you talking about?
Speaker 1: This is my, my mother's mother (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Your mother, so this is your--
Speaker 1: My Grandma Duke [Estelle Taylor Duke] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) grandma, maternal grand- Grandmother Duke.
Speaker 1: --took her three children to a Christian Science Sunday school because she had read something about it, and thought this is pretty interesting.  And they were turned away because they were black.  And my [maternal] grandfather [Charles Duke] would not allow the words to be ever mentioned in the house again.  Apparently, my grandmother kept the 'Science and Health' ['Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures'], which is the book that Mary Baker Eddy wrote.  And my mother knew it was there, but there was never anything else said about it.  Then, when I was--I think, three or four--my father's [Herman Tate] best friend was one of the best doctors in Chicago--Taft Raines.  And they had done everything they could, you know, to find out how I was, but I had this awful respiratory problem.  And, you know, it was like, there's nothing we can do.  I mean, there was not supposed to be a chance in, I don't know how many, that I could live beyond the age of five.  And at the same time, every time my mother would go back to the doctor after my sister [HistoryMaker Amy Tate Billingsley] was born, something else was wrong with her--with my mother.  And so, she said, she, you know, when she was getting this, this awful prognosis about me, she went to church that Sunday.  She went to the Congregational church which, I guess, was her family's church then.  And she said the minister was preaching a sermon on love.  And he said, I don't know anything about Christian Science, but it has the most beautiful sense of love, understanding of love, that I know of.  And she said, this made no sense to her because that had not been her experience.  But she also knew Hattie Johnson, who would belong to--she was the family that were the Hall Johnson singers who used to travel the Chautauqua circuits.  And if you haven't heard of them yet, I don't know why not.  Somebody would have brought them up.  But Hattie Johnson was a wonderful woman who lived in Chicago, and had become a Christian Scientist, and was a Christian Science practitioner.  So, mother went to talk to Mrs. Johnson, and she said, I don't understand this.  I mean, you know, this makes no sense to me.  And Mrs. Johnson said to her--it's very important to understand that there's a difference between what something is, and what people do with it.  And that was really important because, of course, what happened was that I had a wonderful healing.  And there were others that is worth a book, that were particular to me, and big changes in our family, and in our family's fortunes.  So, my mother became very serious about studying Christian Science.  And I wanted to know, just know more, you know, I mean; I'd, I'd had this experience.
Story_ID: 443713
Speaker 1: But in terms of basic religion, growing up, we, when we lived in Morgan Park [Chicago, Illinois], the Spielmans [ph.], our next door neighbors, were staunch Roman Catholics, and they were all over the place.  And the woman who took me, the young woman who took me to school every day--we went to Mass every day on the way to school.  And our Girl Scout troop was at Beth Eden Baptist Church [Chicago, Illinois], and we went there sometimes.  And then, there was St. Anselm's Episcopal Church [Chicago, Illinois] that a lot of kids went to and, you know, a lot of our friends were involved in, and we went there sometimes.  And then, there was--why can't--let's see, Beth Eden was the Baptist church.  And I can't remember the Methodist church that was closer to school.  We went there sometimes--just, so it was just, it was a neighborhood, you know, it was a neighborhood, and kids grew up together.  The parents were all friends.  I mean, I remember people would argue, though, about whether you bit the wafer, or swallowed it, you know.  And kids would get in arguments about your biting the body of Christ.  And so it was, you know, it was learning, learning things about different kinds of beliefs and, but also understanding the commonalities of them, in a way that people don't when they're just these, and these, and these, and these.  So, I would say that, that was another important part of my religious experience.
Story_ID: 443714
Speaker 1: I remember thinking that--I mean, because with the Christian Science church, for instance, you know, they had, and I point this out to, to some of my friends these days.  They had the word, colored, in their, in their journals, you know, where it says where the churches are, and where the practitioners are.  They would have colored, by colored churches and colored practitioners until 1954.  And I figure they only took it out because the [U.S.] Supreme Court said they had to.  But, it didn't mean that we didn't still have wonderful experiences that--I mean, not being connected to a church organization; you're not being sort of accepted in a church organization and, yet, I never had a bad experience in one of those churches, but I think my sister [HistoryMaker Amy Tate Billingsley] did.  So, it's--I, I got to say a couple more things about that.  The thing that kept my interest in it, besides feeling an outsider about a lot of other things, is visiting with the family of--some good friends of my parents [Inez Duke Tate and Herman Tate] had a child who had been born a perfectly normal child.  The father was, was a professional person.  I don't want to put their business out.
Speaker 2: You don't want to what, I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: I don't want to put their business out where it shouldn't be but--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --but they were a wonderful family, who were good friends of ours, and he was a medical practitioner.  And this child was born a normal child.  But because, I think, she was a little premature and, and she'd been put in an incubator in one way, and then another.  Because of just a series of medical mistakes, she became almost totally blind and deaf.  And her parents were wonderful, you know--we were, and so, we grew up with her.  She didn't live in the same city, but I remember watching her when she was about eleven one night.  And we were sharing a room where they were living.  And we'd all gone to this big anniversary celebration.  And she was standing there staring at a, at a light bulb, trying desperately to see it more clearly.  And the tears were just rolling down her eyes and her face.  And I just remember thinking, I want to learn whatever I can that can help heal people, help people feel better.  You know, sometimes I wanted to be a doctor.  I wanted to be a nun.  I wanted to be, you know, all these kinds of things, but it was always back to what I think I mentioned to you earlier, what am I supposed to do with the gift of my life?  And I suppose that, that's a religious experience.  It is.  But I really--I guess I believe in God as, and it's always been so ever-present to me because it's been such a palpable thing.  I mean, when you see and experience the kinds of, of emotional and physical, and every other kind of healings that I have, you know that it's not you.  But I knew that from, you know, when, you know, my grandmother--everybody always felt that God was there, bigger than us.  The angels are God's thoughts that come to you.  Nobody can ever take them away.  I've been in some terrifically difficult political situations, professionally, where in one case, all I could think of, if somebody said to me, my hands are tied.  I was going to be in a terrible situation.  Well, after all the other experiences that I had, you know, was I going to say, oh, dear, you know.  I woke up in the morning, and I looked at the story of Elisha, when the King of Syria is after him because he knows too much, you know.  And he wakes up in the morning, and his servant wakes up and says, oh, my Lord, you know, we're surrounded.  And Elisha says, Lord, open the young man's eyes so he may see.  And he sees the armies, the angels all around them.  And I thought, that's my answer, because from what I knew from growing up is that angels are God's thoughts, and I've got those.  Nobody can take those away from me.  And I said, those angels will tell me what I need to do.  And one thing after another, I just knew each step to take, and that's happened all along my life.  We've had so many impossible situations.  And, each time, it was either something like that, or having learned the lesson of Job, you know (laughter), the humility that says, okay, Lord, what do you want me to do now?  And you learn that when there are no other solutions.  So, I would say, it's been watching my family have hard, difficult to hard things, going through it myself.  And it makes you feel like, you know, you--there's a point at which you know that you're not afraid.  And you know that there is nothing else that controls you.  I think that was another important thing my dad [Herman Tate]--you're never a victim of anything else.
Story_ID: 443715
Speaker 1: And this is the last question about religion, and you can give me a short answer.
Speaker 2: That's all right.
Speaker 1: But the God of your childhood--this, the physical God, is--
Speaker 2: It's not a physical God.
Speaker 1: But not, okay--well, not physical.
Speaker 2: There, you put your finger on it--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because, to me, I think that mankind has made God in its image, rather than any other way around (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.  And that's what I--and that was my question--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I think that God is--
Speaker 1: --what was the image in which you saw God?  Was he black or white?  Did he have blond hair?
Speaker 2: He was not a person.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's one of the earliest things I learned--
Speaker 1: And who taught you?
Speaker 2: --is that God is qualities.  I learned that from everything, you know, that God is qualities.
Speaker 1: So, no one sat you down and says, oh, here's this passage in the Bible, or God has this wooly hair and this--
Speaker 2: Oh, no.
Speaker 1: --and this is, okay, I see.
Speaker 2: I think, if anything, I got sort of the opposite of that because it had to get beyond.  You know, all of the great people that we think of have gotten beyond the sense of human history.  I mean, if, if Gandhi [Mahatma Gandhi], if Martin Luther King [Revered Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], if so many of our--if Jesus had gotten--had only gone by who their human forbearers--what they had done and known, they never would have done anything.  You know, with Jesus, when he went back to Nazareth, you know, a lot of people, they--he didn't heal much there or anything because all they could see was the carpenter's son.  You know, they kept saying, well, isn't that the carpenter's son?  How could he know any more than anybody else?  And, and learning things about that story early on, you, you begin to get a sense of, you know, God is a whole lot more than, than we can imagine.  And I have a number of friends who are, you know, academic theologians of various kind, and what-not.  And one interesting person I met was in-I was in a seminar with in Aspen [Colorado] is Elaine Pagels who wrote 'Adam, Eve, and the Serpent.'  And I remember us having a discussion about the part of, in the beginning in the Bible.  And I had known, just from the study--actually, my study of what I'd learned in Christian Science, which I hate to use the word 'cause I think of it, not as a church, or a religion, or a movement, but, basically, a science.
Speaker 1: So, you are--
Speaker 2: It's interesting to me.
Speaker 1: --as, or today, you're a Christian Scientist?
Speaker 2: I'm not going to say that.
Speaker 1: You're not going to say that?
Speaker 2: Today--
Speaker 1: But, but the principles you still believe in?
Speaker 2: The principles--yes, interest me.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, the best (unclear) about, at (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I used them, I used them with great effect.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I had learned the, the concept that in the, in the beginning was originally translated in the only, and I had learned that.  Well, then, I get with all these other people, and discover that, yes, theologically, this is something that has been known for a long time.  And so, if you think about, God is the only, you know, in the only, instead of in the beginning.  That puts a whole different face on things.  So, I was talking to a youngster, a seventeen-year-old once, that we were talking with.  And she said, well, you know, I think I can understand that, but my question is, who created God?  Oh, I said, well, when I was your age, I had that question, too.  And every now and then I think, I got almost got a handle on it, but then, I couldn't quite.  So, I said, well, let's think about it.  And, and there may be five or six kids we're talking to.  What kinds of, what qualities do you think of as God?  Well, most of the Christian world and, actually, much of the, of the non-Christian world will think of God, or whatever the Supreme Being is, as love.  And so, I said, okay, so we think of God as love, if God is truth, you know, what really is, and you think of what truth really is, we thought of several things.  If God is principle, and we thought, aha, suppose God is a principle.  We started thinking about the principle of mathematics.  And I said, you know, think about the principle of mathematics that never began;  it'll never end; it just is.  And, to me, that was an awakening for me.  And I--and with a lot of people I know of various religions, as we talk about that, people say, hey, how come (laughter) we didn't get that?  So, to me, that's what--God is part of our lives, is to try to understand, and put into practice those qualities, the best we can.  And when, to the extent we can, we learn more.  So, I guess I don't, in the same way, for instance, I don't think of somebody, like Mary Baker Eddy, as somebody that you follow as a person any more than I think of following the pope as a person or, or anybody who has, in a sense, you know, there have been moments of illumination in time, when people have seen something.  With Wesley [John Wesley], for instance, with the--he was a healer way back then.  But, you know, when a, when a religion becomes institutionalized, it loses a lot.  You know, if you start--stop, and think about it, there was a lot of healing in Christianity, up until about I think 400 A.D.  And it's like, the stronger, the more institutionalized the church got, the less healing there was.  I think you'll find that with virtually every church organization.
Speaker 1: So, I got to keep moving though.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but, but the church still feeds people's souls, and then it keeps--whatever the church is, it helps people continue to realize that there's something bigger than themselves.  So, I guess with the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Which is very important.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your school.
Speaker 2: And something bigger than money.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 443716
Speaker 1: First grade through sixth grade, who were the teachers who made a difference for you?
Speaker 2: Well, kindergarten, I'm going to go back to kindergarten when we lived in the Rosenwald [Rosenwald Apartments; Michigan Boulevard Apartments, Chicago, Illinois].  We went over on--near Dearborn Street to kindergarten.  And the thing I remembered was that we would lie on our mats in the afternoon.  And in our rest time, and we would listen to things, like 'Skye Boat Song' ['The Skye Boat Song'], of all things.  And that was the beginning of history, you know, "Carry the boy who's bound to be king, who's born to be king, over the sea to Skye."  You know, what we felt like, as this little child who's being taken over to sea to safety and stuff, you know.  Kids relate to things like that.  And then, when we moved out to Morgan Park [Chicago, Illinois], I did another semester of kindergarten.  So, that's when and how I know it was--I was six then, just about six.  And that was Mrs. Wallace [ph.], whose kids were our age and, and we were friends forever.  And then, first grade, I had--I don't remember the teacher's name--Mrs. Brazil [ph.] (whispers)--I just remember that I thought she was the best first grade teacher in the school.  And I suspect she was.  I mean, you know, kids are very, very astute, very aware of which teachers require the most, and which ones help discipline the children's thinking the most.  But I remember that first grade year very much.
Story_ID: 443717
Speaker 1: I loved school, you know, even, even though I--I mean--as I loved the playground as much.  You know, I was wild on playground, and also besides the fact that I would have to hit that door, and run home down the railroad tracks, tracks before I got beat up until, you know, I had to learn to stand my ground.
Speaker 2: How did you learn to stand your ground?
Speaker 1: Well, this was during World War II [WWII].  And my Uncle Jesse [ph.] was in the [U.S.] Navy, and he taught me a little judo.  And I came home from school one day--I mean, I got so I could, you know--I, I, I don't remember a lot of it, but I remember running home down the railroad tracks, watching that the kids were kind of waiting for me; I knew how to avoid that.  And I was fine at school, you know, on the playground.  And I was pretty well-respected, 'cause I could run fast and, you know, once they discovered I could run fast and I could, you know, do most anything.  But one day, I came home and it had, it had snowed.  And my [paternal] grandmother [Salina Harris Vesey] told me to go next door, that she had borrowed the, borrowed an iron from Mrs. Spielman [ph.] or, or I was returning one--I don't remember which.  But I had to go next door to return the iron--I think that's what it was.  And I didn't want to go because I knew there were kids out there who had followed me home.  And I tried to tell her this, and she wasn't having any of it, you know, I still had to go.  But also in my family, I was in trouble if I fought.  You know, I mean, you had, you had to teach your children not to fight, or they were going--that was, yeah, you really would have been gangs earlier than they were.  But people, some people, like with my family, you talk to children, you don't fight.  And my father [Herman Tate] said, you figure out a better way to keep--you can keep peace without fighting.  And so, I had to figure out how you do that.  So, I go next door and, sure enough, I take the iron, and I come out.  And these kids are there waiting for me.  And they, fortunately, most of them were bigger than me, but there was one girl who lived down at the end of the street who was more my size.  And I just remember her name was Hortense [ph.].  And Hortense, if you're watching this, I'm sorry, but that's--and so, they had her jump me.  And she jumped me, and it was like one of those moments when I had, had enough.  And I turned around and I locked my elbow under her neck (laughter), and I threw her down in the snow.  I didn't hit her, you know, I threw her down in the snow.  And I sat on her, and I washed her face with snow, and she opened her mouth to holler, and I stuffed some down her mouth.  I never hit her.  And, you know, and everybody--you know how kids are--and they, they thought, they wanted to see this.  They thought this was really something.  And then, you know, I let her up.  And nobody ever bothered me again.  And the only other time I ever came close to having to fight, or wanting to fight, was when I was walking home.  And I was very protective of Amy [Cline's sister, HistoryMaker Amy Tate Billingsley] and because she was the (unclear) sometimes, people would want to pick on her--don't anybody pick on my little sister.  So, we were coming home.  And there was this girl and I won't mention her name, and she jumped on Amy.  And she was rolling on her, and I couldn't hit her.  I didn't quite know what to do.  And I, and I, I had--there was a tree, a tree branch there.  And I picked up this tree thing, and I stuck it up under her dress, and lifted her off of my sister.  Of course, ripped her dress and, man, her grandmother gave her fits.  I mean, we heard her hollering, you know, (laughter), when she got home.  And nobody ever bothered either one of us.

Speaker 1: You know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What type of student were you--
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: --with your school work?
Speaker 1: Oh, I was really good because, because, you know, I sort of played the piano a little bit, and I read books.  I mean, who--and, and, you know, I was a thing on the playground.  But I had glasses, you know, four eyes was four eyes.  And, and I loved learning, and I knew that, just from everything that my family ever said, you know, if I ever went--and I wanted, I wanted the world, you know.  I didn't want to, I didn't want to ever feel like, I couldn't do things.  I wanted to be able to go anywhere in the world, do whatever I wanted to do.  I wanted to, if I wanted to climb mountains, and my father's [Herman Tate] attitude was, why not?  I mean, everything about him was, if you really do something and it's worthwhile, why not?
Speaker 2: What did you want to be at that time, like first through third grade, what were your aspirations in life (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I didn't have any.  I just, I just wanted to run, and roller skate, and read and, you know, anything.
Speaker 2: At what age (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I wanted to be--well, maybe between, you know, between fourth grade and, and eighth grade is when you sort of start thinking about things like that.  But it didn't--I kind of had a sense that I would be whatever I needed to be, you know, whatever the characteristics were, they would find a place.  But as I told you, I wanted to be a nun, I wanted to be a doctor, I wanted to be a truck driver, I wanted to be a railroad engineer because those--and then I could go, you know; the truck driver and the railroad engineer; was something in me that I wanted to be able to just go.
Story_ID: 443719
Speaker 1: When did you find music?
Speaker 2: Always.  You know, my dad [Herman Tate] really loved music.  And we had a piano at home, and I took piano lessons, took them in school, and then took them with a lady, 'cause it was like, well, you can do a little bit more than the usual.  And, and I had the time in myself. You know, kids are not terribly socially active.  You know, there were some things that we could do, some we couldn't.  We couldn't just run the streets.  We had, you know, fairly strict rules.  And there were lots of houses that we were not allowed to go to, but anybody could come to ours as long as they, you know, obeyed the rules in our household.  So, it was not a sense of exclusivity.  It was except as, except as, as referred to values.  And I think my parents were just very careful about that and--
Speaker 1: Any other teachers (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You should not have started asking me all these questions (laughter).
Speaker 1: Why (laughter)?
Speaker 2: I could talk for ten years.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Are there any teachers that you can think of that made an impression upon you, or, or let me say (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They all did in their way.
Speaker 1: --that just put their hands on you, that said, little girl, you're going to go someplace?
Speaker 2: I already knew that.  I mean, yeah, I, I, it's funny that, that should come out of my mouth that way, but the reason--and I don't think of some place.  But let me tell you two stories that will go back to that.  My father's brothers and sisters would come--every time we had a piano recital or anything--I mean, these are people who never even went to high school, 'cause they couldn't where they lived.  They would go to everything.  And they used to say to my sister [HistoryMaker Amy Tate Billingsley] and me, "Oh, you're so smart."  Now, we weren't doing anything unusual; we were just going to school, but our parents were able to give us--going to school, and piano lessons, and things like that, that they had never had.  And so, they kind of lived through us in a way.  And I'm talking about sort of the countryside of my family, who were the ones, who really influenced me the most.  And it was important to me that, that they always came to everything.  And when I went off to college [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio]--this was after my father had died, I went off to college.  And my Aunt Alma [ph.] didn't have a lot of money, but she would have baked me fried pies, 'cause she knew I loved fried pies.  And if you've never had fried pies, you've just missed life.  Anybody in my generation will know what fried pies were, but she would make the best fried pies.  And she would send them to me special delivery to Ohio, and I would get them still warm, because that meant something to her. I was doing something that meant something to her. And I think I thought more like that, like whatever it is that is out there in the world that I'm supposed to do with the gift of my life as I mentioned before. And I didn't--my mother [Inez Duke Tate] used to often say don't try to outline--you can't outline God, but you can listen to what God wants you to do. And so it wasn't a question of I'm going to be a this or I'm going to be a that. It was that you already are in yourself-you're God's tool or God's reflection and I was always interested in how to do that. But Aunt Alma would do that and I felt that way about my other aunts and uncles. And so when I was doing a master's degree out here [at the University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado], I had a teacher who said to me at one point basically, why do you have to--essentially, why do you have to be so much better, you know, than--why do you have to be such an achiever or whatever; why was I doing--and I was so surprised when he said that. And I stopped and I looked at him and I said--I was thinking about Aunt Alma and all of them and a couple of things--and I said, "Because it's not just my life; it's not just my life; it's never been just my life." And when I had to write an essay to get a fellowship once; and I had to write it in a hurry, the thing that came to me--I wrote it, it was called, 'The Last One Hundred Years of My Life' because to me my life always has been the result in a certain way of what everybody else before has worked for, been proud of, tried to do, tried to accomplish. And I'm just kind of a piece in that--I don't want to call it a chain because a chain is too finite--but it's just a part of the journey and I think I have always thought of myself that way.

Speaker 1: Go ahead (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All right.
Speaker 1: The elementary school then we'll get to your teen years.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there are a couple of other things in elementary school that were important to me--I'm going to say another thing is when I was six, I went to see 'Bambi' and it--and I cried, it scared me.  I mean, so this is kind of, about my sensibility.  In grade school, we watched 'Tom Sawyer' ['The Adventures of Tom Sawyer'], and I had nightmares about Injun Joe chasing them in the--you know, I don't deal with stuff like that very well.  All right. I remember for one-half year, I was in my mother's [Inez Duke Tate] class because I start--in second grade, they started skipping.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm sorry.  Just for a moment, we'll--I will get those stories, but you--just--something just jumped out, and I've got to jump in and ask.  You said you went to see 'Bambi' (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was it a segregated theatre?  Did you have to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh probably; this was when I was five, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, you don't remember?
Speaker 2: Oh, everything was segregated in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And so, it, it never made an impression on you that--
Speaker 2: Oh, no.
Speaker 1: --and I'm having to go.  Okay, so just (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, because I mean, segregation, it was just a fact of life.  And as I told you earlier, we, I knew we had to live some place.  There were places we couldn't live, and I felt that's too bad for other people (laughter), just--
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  So, so--
Speaker 2: --which I thought was wonderful as I got to be an adult.
Speaker 1: Right.  So, the movie made more of an impression on you than, than where you had to sit in the theatre?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I was--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, just keep going.
Speaker 2: --you know, big deal.  That was other people's problems 'cause I was a happy kid, you know.  And I had a wonderful family, so why should I worry about what somebody else thought, you know?
Speaker 1: Okay.  To--continuing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, there, there are pieces of that, that, you know, there were problems.  But they didn't feel like--I mean, like my father's [Herman Tate] car was stoned once, and stuff like that.  But it was something that we kind of learned to live through, basically, as, you know, sooner or later, the world will get a little better, and these, these folks' problem.  And, you, you learn how to deal with it, but it never made me feel like lesser of anything.  And that's been fortunate 'cause I think a lot of people have all of their lives felt like, well, somehow the man over there has got the answers.  And I've never felt that way.  And remind me, to tell you what happened when I moved out there, when I really understood that.  But back to this quick elementary school thing.  As I started getting skipped through school because, because I liked to learn, and it was, you know, there was-- everybody was there.  And some kids had more preparation than others.  And since my mother was in the school, she would never let them let me skip a grade.  And that when you had 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, and so on, so I think I, I skipped 2B.  I went to 2A.  And she always made sure that, that I was in--whatever classroom I was in, had the, also the half a grade in it that I had skipped 'cause she figured that I would kind of, you know, absorb whatever else was there, which I did.  You know, I didn't think about it.  But one, for one semester, I was in her classroom.  And that wasn't wonderful because the kid's mother is always going to be their mother.  So, you know, you're, you're always, you're not totally paying attention just to school.  But I was very interested in the dynamic in the classroom, like we had--people talk about small classes, and things here.  Well, you know, there were six rows in every room, and eight seats in every row, so I mean, forty-eight kids in a class was no big deal.  And you knew everybody in the class.  The teachers never--but I do remember one of the big kids one day was going to walk--I think, was it sixth grade?  Anyway, he was going to leave the class, and he was mad at my mother.  And the door to the room was at the front.  And he starts walking around, and he was already bigger than she 'cause she was only 5'2".  And I remember her just standing there, just kind of quivering.  She was so angry with him.  I mean, she wasn't scared, she was just angry.  And he was, I'm going to walk on out of here, you know.  And so, he's walking along, and she's watching him, and she's going to meet him at the door.  So, she's walking toward the door with her eye on him.  And he's walking, and he gets about that far, and she's standing there still just looking at him.  And he turns around, and goes back to his seat.  That was an important thing, you know, about standing your ground.  I mean if, if, if he was going to beat her up, she was not going to back down.  You know, it's one of those things.  So that, again, is a, it's a, it's a character-forming thing.
Story_ID: 443721
Speaker 1: I also had, for a music teacher, a music-math teacher, in seventh grade [at John D. Shoop Elementary School; Shoop Academy of Math, Science, and Technology, Chicago, Illinois], Ken Stewart [Kenneth Stewart].  He played trombone as a sub in Earl Hines' [Earl "Fatha" Hines] band.  And we sang, we sang things like 'The Old Lamplighter.'  So, we sang a lot in his class and I loved it.  He loved music and, of course, of course, and also loved math because he was a good math teacher.  And he also told the story of how he was sitting in Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois], I think it was, one day, a while before that.  And this bum had come up to him, and asked him if he could--I guess take him for a cup of coffee or something.  And he said he was impressed that the guy didn't just ask him for a dime for a cup of coffee, you know, would, and then go off and spend it on something else.  And so, he said he took him--they started chatting.  Well, it ended up being up Nat King Cole.  You know, so it was just those kinds of things that, that connected us so much.  And, and, of course, also when I grew up, we lived near the, near the Savoy Ballroom [Chicago, Illinois].  So, there was all of that going on in my life, plus my father [Herman Tate] then also would get records of Rubinstein [Arthur Rubinstein] and Horowitz [Vladimir Horowitz] playing the piano, and 'Tales from the Vienna Woods' [Johann Strauss II].  So, Paul Robeson's 'Ballad for Americans,' which was one of the most profound things, but also Rise Stevens singing love songs, you know.  So, it was the whole, the whole thing always, in my musical background.  So, Mr. Stewart was important.  And then, another fun thing, right before I graduated, was that we had got this young eighth grade teacher who had graduated from college when she was nineteen and everything.  And she taught us, not only music, and she was brilliant, you know, Latin stuff she knew and everything.  And she also taught us things like, how to do the hula and stuff.  It was Barbara Sizemore [HistoryMaker Barbara A. Sizemore], and she--her name was Ms. Laffoon then.  And this, I think we might have been her first teaching job.  But she had a tremendous im- impact, and so did Mrs. Cunningham [ph.], who was also, I think, there.  But I hope what you're getting is what I got in my life.  There were all these different people, each of whom was vibrant in their own way.  Some were quiet, some were very flamboyant, but there was a kind of a sense of purpose, a purpose for us, a purpose for the children, a purpose for the world, whatever.  I got that really young and I think that, that was so important.  And along with it was it's not for what you can get for yourself.  You know, we're helping you learn how to be the kind of person who can make a difference for other people.  All right, that was grade school.
Story_ID: 443722
Speaker 1: So, because I've been skipped the equivalent of about two years, I guess, by--and so, I was eleven in eighth grade, which was okay, because I was this tall.  I'm 5'10", and I was just about this tall when I was in eighth grade, and wore size ten--size eight shoes, so it was not unusual.  And I couldn't kind of run around socially with everybody anyway.  And, and my, my sister [HistoryMaker Amy Tate Billingsley] was real popular with everybody, but I wasn't--I had some friends but--
Speaker 2: Did you still have the, the glasses?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, I wore the glasses until I moved out here and, and contact lenses came out.
Speaker 2: So, where did you go to high school?
Speaker 1: All right, so high school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The name of the high school?
Speaker 1: --came up and my parents [Inez Duke Tate and Herman Tate] discussed behind closed doors--and I was a good listener behind closed doors.  And they struggled because I should have--I would have gone to Morgan Park High School [Chicago, Illinois].  And, of course, it was in that neighborhood over there, which I used to walk through to go to the library all the time.  And I, you know, I, I felt really comfortable doing it.  A little girl hollered to me from her, her porch once.  I was walking up to the library which is a nice walk.  And she said--I think I may have been ten then 'cause I was really very innocent.  And she says, "Hi, nigger!"  And I looked at her, and I said, "My name's not nigger, my name is Eileen [HistoryMaker Eileen Cline].  What's your name?"  And so, she told me her name, and, and every time we, we would chat.  I mean, it's just, I think probably because of stuff that my dad and I had talked about, I just simply figured she didn't know any better.  And I wasn't going to go and cower, you know, she says, "Hi, nigger."  I said, "That's not my name," (laughter).  I think that's kind of been typical, too.  But anyway, they were not that keen on a Morgan Park High education at that point.  And, and since they had both gone to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and they knew about the University of Chicago Laboratory School [University of Chicago High School; University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois], and so, they thought maybe I should go there.  And you had to take a test and all that stuff.  And it, you know, cost money, but it couldn't have cost that much 'cause they didn't have that much money.  I don't know how they afforded it, but that's where I went.  And it was hard for them to make that decision--what went on behind closed doors, 'cause they really believed in public school education.  And they finally decided that it was--the most important thing was for us to get the kind of education with which we then would have greater strength to help more people than if--I mean, there was their, that was the only way they could make themselves say, all right, they can go to that school.  And Amy did, too, a couple of years behind me.  So, I went there.  And one of the important things there--I was insulted the first day 'cause they put me back in eighth grade.  See--I had already finished eighth grade.  And the lab school only went to tenth grade.  And then at the end of tenth grade, then in the Hutchins' era [Robert Maynard Hutchins], you could take the college entrance exam, and go to the college if you passed the exam, which a lot of the kids did.  In my class, everybody did, except one person.  But meanwhile, the high school officially went from seventh grade through tenth grade, whereas in the public schools, high school went nine to twelve.  So, when I finished eighth grade--and I took all the entrance exams and placement tests and things, so they put me in eighth grade.  And, you know, I didn't like that too much.  I was insulted for about one day.  And then, I realized how much I could learn, you know, and I had teachers there who were wonderful teachers--I mean, they were really good teachers.  They did things like, you remember funny things, like in spelling.  A teacher who would say, grammar, you should get all A's in grammar.  I mean, you know, things where they would tell you, but, but you'll not try to make things difficult, but try to help you learn how easy learning really is.  And that was one of the important things I learned there.  And I had lots of good friends there that I have to this day.  There was the--an interesting thing that happened during that time--I went there in '47 [1947].  And the parents--I, I don't know whether my--I think my father knew a couple of them from the co-op movement and what-not.  But the parents decided--I think there were five black kids in our class, and we were to graduate in 1950 from tenth grade.  And the parents got together at some time and, and developed what they call the 1950 Club.  And they decided that they were not going to have a situation in which the black kids were not accepted and, and were not social equals.  Don't tell me--I have no idea where this came from, but that's what they did.  And so, they had this club that the parents sort of did, and they had social activities.  We did weekends together.  We'd go places and do things.  I went to my first musical.  We did all kinds of things.  We were all invited to every bar mitzvah that ever happened, you know, to fancy things at the Edgewater Beach Hotel [Chicago, Illinois], where Fletcher Henderson would be playing and what-not.  And I, you know, I listened enough to know that I wasn't left out of anything.  And, and the parents made a point of that, you know, they sort of engineered the kids' social lives all the way through that period of school.  I don't know that any other class did that, but I felt really--probably as I look back on it, that was one of the most fortunate things because we all truly shared the same kinds of experiences.  So, as an adult and in my professional life and everything, you know, I've run across, stayed friends with, been connected with people that I went to that high school with, because it was very unusual.  In the music situation there, it was very unusual.  It was a very rich life.  And then, I went to the college for two years 'cause I got in.
Speaker 2: What year did you graduate the high school and go to, into the college?
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty [1950].
Story_ID: 443723
Speaker 1: So, 1950, you graduated [from the University of Chicago High School; University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I was fifteen, and I went to the college [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] just as I turned fifteen.  And I lived at home still.  And I just took the street car back 'cause it was like going to high school for me.  It was, you know, same place, different buildings, and I loved it.  I loved the freedom, and I could decide which classes to go to, and which not, and I learned a lot that way.  And then, I had to make the decision.  And I had taken--because of the placement test sorts of things, I had, by the time--essentially by the time I was seventeen, I had finished two years there.  I had most of an undergraduate education, most of the liberal arts degree.  And I wanted, you know, to go away to college, like other people did.  And I, I either wanted to major in physical ed [physical education] 'cause I was, you know, I, I played varsity basketball at the University of Chicago for, for women, and field hockey, and stuff like that.  And I bowled 237, you know.  Either that or music, and those things I liked the best.  And I had been a really good ballet dancer earlier, but I didn't know any black ballerinas.  So, at the time, if they--you know, when I had to make a decision of something to stop, and I couldn't keep doing everything 'cause I was traveling so much to school.  It was either keep up the piano, or keep up the ballet, and since I didn't know any black ballerinas, I stayed with the piano (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did you know any black pianists?
Speaker 2: That didn't matter as much because it was more of a kind of a universal thing.  I mean, you could play.  Then I was taking lessons downtown and stuff.  And, yeah, I mean, you know, you knew about all of the great pianists around.
Speaker 1: Did any (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not classical pianists at that point.
Speaker 1: Gotcha.
Speaker 2: But somehow, that was more of a normal part of life 'cause I came from a musical family.  And (laughter), the funny thing about the ballet thing-- but then, you see then, I also grew up in the same building with somebody like, Frances Taylor [Frances Taylor Davis] who became a wonderful ballet, ballerina.  She was wonderful then, and Louise Stubbs who went to, who was with 'The Blacks' [sic. 'Black Girl,' J.E. Franklin] in, in New York [New York].  I mean, they were wonderful.  We had a, a Danish ballet teacher who taught across from the Rosenwald building [Rosenwald Apartments; Michigan Boulevard Apartments, Chicago, Illinois]--Mildred Hessler [ph.], who taught all of us.  And at least three of them became, you know, really essentially world-class dancers.  And, so that was in another part.  So, I kind of knew about that, but it wasn't something that spoke--I was, I danced in 'Swan Lake' [Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky] at the, at the Eighth Street Theater [Chicago, Illinois] 'cause I was a good dancer.  But I remember (laughter) her saying--I mean, here's this (unclear) and she said, you are a very good, good dancer, but you have no bosom.  Well, I mean, I mean, I really had no bosom.  Ballet dancers don't really, but I really didn't.  And, you know, it was a wonderful thing to do, but it wasn't anything I could see myself spending a whole lot of time at, after a certain point.
Speaker 1: But the music, you could.
Speaker 2: But music, I could, music, I could do.  And then, when I got to be almost seventeen, I was going to go to college.  Those were the two things I thought of.  If I were going to major in something, it was sports or music.  And, I decided that for sports, it would be too hard to always get together enough people to make a baseball team, or something like that.  But for music, anybody could do it.  I mean, it was as simple as that.  And so, that's what I did and I loved it.
Story_ID: 443724
Speaker 1: So, it's about 1952 when you decided (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This is 1952 when I went to Oberlin College [Oberlin, Ohio]. And I went to Oberlin.  It was either Oberlin or Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois], and I chose Oberlin 'cause it was farther from home.  And I had a wonderful family, I loved them, everything.  But what I was worried about was that as a young adult, I would go home a lot, and I would sense what my parents [Inez Duke Tate and Herman Tate] thought I might do or should do, or what they thought about things.  And they would never--they, at that point--'cause my father had said, if you haven't gotten the best that we have to teach you by the time you're fifteen, it's too late.  You know, so he really put the sense of responsibility with me very early 'cause, even when I was a young kid, he'd say, you know what?  Given A, which you maybe can't do anything about--I mean, I don't know whether it was race or whatever--given A, which you can't do anything about, and given B, which maybe you can't do anything about, all I'm interested in is C, what are you doing to do?  He said, you know, there's no need to give me a whole bunch of excuses about--well, I can't do this 'cause of A, or I can't do this 'cause of B.  He said, I want to know, given everything, what are you going to do?  And that was really helpful, but I figured at least if I were at Oberlin, that was a six-hour car drive away, and I wouldn't be running home.  So I did that, and that turned out to be a fabulous experience.  It was a place that it really isn't--it's, it became very different afterwards.  But I went there for one reason; because they didn't have sororities and fraternities.  That's where I would have gotten in trouble with our kind of people 'cause I had seen that.  My mother was an AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority].  My father actually ended up pledging Kappa [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity], and they all had, you know, a good time with all of that.  But there were certain exclusionary things, I thought, about, about sororities and fraternities that, that didn't speak to me.
Speaker 1: Did those things have anything to do with race?
Speaker 2: Oh, they all, everything, in a certain way had to do with race.  I mean, you know, the--at least where we grew up, the Deltas [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority] were lighter, and the AKA's were darker.  And there, there wasn't, there were no Zetas [Zeta Phi Beta Sorority] there, whatever.  And, but also, there was still this, this fundamental family value about that came so much, particularly from my dad about people being people.  And so, going to a place where they had no sororities or fraternities said to me that there is an ethic here that is about, we all can accomplish the same thing.  And we all can, can make the same contribution.  And here, they're always all those undercurrents.  I mean, like the, the dean, the dean of women, didn't like it when my boyfriend [William Cline], who had graduated already, who was the guy I married eventually, wasn't there.  And I wanted to go to the senior prom.  And I had been involved in a co-op, co-op house, a (unclear) used to come and sing there, and all that stuff.  But I had another really good friend who had belonged to another organization with me, and he was white, and we thought well, we'll go the prom together because I wanted to go and, and he didn't have a girlfriend to go with, so we were go--.  Lo and behold, I get this summons from the dean who had heard about it.  And so, I went in to see her, and she was, you know, very gently going to discourage me from going.  And, to me, what she was trying to say to me was so different from what I understood as the soul of that school at that point.  And, you know, knowing her, I said, you know, well, that's very nice that you feel that way, but don't worry about it.  So, we went.
Speaker 1: What did she say to you though?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.  I mean, she wasn't going to come right out and say I couldn't go, you know.  You know, people would kind of discourage me.  I was not a discourage-able child and I was just not a discourage-able person.  And so, I understood her concerns, but I went, and we had a great time.  It's interesting--I was talking with a guy just last week on the phone who's Jewish, and went there also and turns out had also gone to--I guess I know, he'd gone to the lab school [University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois] at some point.  But we found that we had all kinds of other connections, you know, of, of real interracial stuff; anyway then and he said--I was reminding him and then, he said, he said that was pretty funny, he said.  But, you know, she also called me in--said because he was dating some girl he wanted to date, and the girls--someplace who came from somewhere in the South, and some of the background.  And because he was Jewish, and he said, he didn't realize that she was trying to discourage him from--and he said he was afraid it didn't have much more effect on him than (laughter) it did on me.  But, you know, in our era, we, we dealt with stuff like that.
Story_ID: 443725
Speaker 1: But you were living kind of in an isolated environment because the rest of the country, or a big part of the rest of the country, was doing exactly the opposite.
Speaker 2: In the?
Speaker 1: In the 1950s.
Speaker 2: Early '50s [1950s], you meant with us (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The early '50s [1950s].   I mean, like down south, people were being enriched (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But, yes, I mean, I associate Oberlin [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio] with a very--absolutely.  I, I remember Emmett Till.  And, yes, and, yeah, it wasn't that I never had any bad experiences.  And I'm trying to tell you about the things that, that opened my eyes, and opened my life.  And, you know, I had family who still lived in the South, you know.  I had family who didn't have running water and stuff like that, but they were still people.  And the, and the struggle for--to me, the struggle was always to find your way, and understand your way, I would say, beyond the limitations.  And that's what my dad [Herman Tate] did.  That's why everybody flocked to him.  And it didn't matter who it was or what it was--and to my mom [Inez Duke Tate]. But it was always, there is more; you don't have to knuckle under.
Story_ID: 443726
Speaker 1: So, what did you get your degree in?
Speaker 2: In--I got two degrees.  I got one in piano, and one in music education because, you know, nobody--I didn't know what to do as a pianist.  And I, and I was kind of shy, believe it or not (laughter).  I was very shy.  And I didn't, I was not a stage person, but I loved, I sang in the Oberlin College [Oberlin, Ohio] choir.  It was my heart, I mean, you know, the things that we would sing about.  We'd sing about Job's devout patience.  We would sing Abrahams's motet of: "Make me, O Lord God, pure in heart," you know, which, it just did things to me.  And the one thing I did not want to do was be a teacher; because my mother [Inez Duke Tate] was a teacher. You know I wanted to do, you know, more than that.  And my mother was little and nice, and all that stuff.  And I wanted to be more than a teacher, other than a teacher.  But I still took a music, took music education because I could do it.  I had most of a liberal arts degree already, so I only had to take a couple of correspondence courses, and I think music ed [music education] courses, and I could do that still in my four-year period of time.  And so, I did that.  And then, right after my sophomore year, I, I needed to make some--my father [Herman Tate] had died--we had no money for, for anything.  And so, I would just--
Speaker 1: When did your father die?
Speaker 2: Right before I went to college.  And, but I had all the important things.  I mean, I knew what he would have expected me to be able to do.  So, and oh, I didn't cry and weep and carry on.
Speaker 1: And he expected those things of you by age fifteen?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  So, and, and I had, you know, when I really would get stuck--and I think this was another thing that I suppose is maybe you'd call a religious experience.  But I remember walking some place my freshman year.  And for the first time, really not having him to talk to, and, you know, to really try to help figure things out, and that was when I began to really think about, you know, God will tell me what to do.  And I had to learn how, if I was not willing to walk down to the corner, then I wouldn't know what was around it, you know, that kind of thing.  And I also decided that year that I would read all of the gospels.  And that was a lot of what kept me going, you know.  And, and I would take those principles as much as I could and, and, and it, it helped me--I think the way religion has always helped people.  It would help me get beyond what would otherwise seem like the limitations.  I mean, there's no way people could have survived slavery without knowing that there was, you know, without knowing that there was something beyond, you know, in the God that you could trust and follow, even though it seemed like you were having a hard time.  And so, having to look beyond the sense of, of personal guidance, I think maybe for most people is what helps them grow and go because once you learn that your life cannot depend on people.  I mean, to be--it cannot depend on a person because that's changeable.  You know, it, it, and if it doesn't depend on something bigger than that, then you're really in trouble (laughter), you know.
Speaker 1: So, you graduated Oberlin in 1954?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-six [1956].
Speaker 1: Fifty-six [1956].
Speaker 2: I went there in '52 [1952] and graduated in '56 [1956].  And nobody knew I couldn't get a job, you know.
Story_ID: 443727
Speaker 1: Let me just ask you this.  So, in '54 [1954], when Brown v. Board of Ed [Brown v. Board of Education, Topeka, 1954], [U.S.] Supreme Court just outlawed segregation, what were your thoughts about what, what the courts had done?
Speaker 2: Basically, it was about time (laughter).  But I, yeah, you know, to me, it's always been well, you know, people are gradually waking up.  And when people would say you can't legislate behavior, you know, I--they would say.  And I said, oh, yes, you can because I'd known enough and seen enough by then to know that a large percent of your people always will do what they think is allowable.  They basically do what, what people do.
Speaker 1: What did other people in the co-op think at the time where this group of (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't remember.
Speaker 1: You don't remember?
Speaker 2: I don't remember because we were just on our way.  You know, I mean, we were singing folk songs, working together, and doing our thing at school [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio], and just figuring that maybe sooner or later, the rest of the world would catch up with us.  Maybe that was part of it.
Speaker 1: So, in '56 [1956], you graduated, but you can't find a job?
Speaker 2: I graduated, and I applied for music teaching jobs, like all the country.  I wanted to do something special, and got nothing back, and here I was, I was a really good student.  I graduated Pi Kappa Lambda.  I was, you know, one of the best in (unclear) (laughter).  And I remember that I got on a plane--only the second time I flew in my life, and I had to go to the meeting in Boston [Massachusetts].  I can't remember what that was about.  But, anyway, I was flying out of Midway Airport [Chicago Midway International Airport] in Chicago [Illinois].  And it was a cloudy day, and I got on the plane and we went up, and the only other time I had flown had been at night.  So, this was my first experience being up above the clouds, and I could see it was brilliant sunshine up there.  And you could see all these clouds, like a featherbed.  And I remember looking out the window thinking about that.  And all of a sudden, it occurred to me, you know, it was all dark and cloudy and everything, down below.  And up here, the sunshine is up here and everything.  And all of a sudden, it occurred to me, you know, back when man was first trying to invent the wheel, this was possible.  He just didn't know it.  Yeah, I don't know where that thought came from, but I think it was the last time that I ever, in my life, felt that there was any limitation at all because I realize that, that what humanity has tried to do all along is it's taking these principles, you know.  We're talking about God as principle, that's always been, or a math principle whatever, it's always been there.  And mankind has used it.  It's tried to learn it, and use it when it needed, too.  And when it's pretty comfortable along the way, it doesn't bother much.  And then, when something has to go beyond, then they start kind of focusing again and trying to find out what is this thing that is so much bigger than us?  And so, anyway, so then I came back home.  And I think it had opened my thought a lot.  And somebody said, why don't you go--I think I hear they need music teachers in Gary, Indiana, and I had never thought of going to Gary to teach.  Well, I went over there, got hired on the spot.
Story_ID: 443728
Speaker 1: Taught six hundred kids a day.  I had a wonderful time.  For two years, I taught public school music in Gary [Indiana], which is another book I'm not--you're not going to get me into that on--but I had a ball.  I taught them everything because their teacher--they had a white teacher for thirty years before I came.  This was Lincoln School in Gary, Indiana.  These kids, I heard about how much they loved music.  I get in there and I find out they could sing, "Rock-a My Soul in the Bosom of Abraham" and "I Got Shoes," and they were happy, you know.  And they had these little records, 'El Torito' or 'The Little Bull' which was 'Carmen' [Georges Bizet] and stuff.  And I'm thinking, you know, these kids are growing up in the same kind of environment that I grew up in.  And yet, people are treating them like this is all they can do. So I decided--here I was, twenty one years old. I went to the music supervisor in the city, Mr. Hendrickson [ph.], and I said, I think that we can do better than this, because I don't see why these children can't learn all the things that I know. I think the curriculum you have is not worthy of them. And he looked at me--I mean here I am, this is my first job and all of this. And he said, "Well if you can figure out something better, you know, I'll give you the year to do it." I said, "Okay." So I went--we had more fun--I taught them all the instruments of the orchestra. I taught them-they could hear the difference between a violin and the viola. I mean I knew these kids had minds, they had ears like you wouldn't believe. I mean you know, because we lived by oral history in our communities. And so I taught them--and I remember one day I said to them, "You know there was this man who had twenty children--" and they got really interested "--and he used to write songs for his kids, and things--" so they got the sense of things-and I was telling them about Bach [Johann Sebastian Bach]. Well by the time I got through, they adored Bach. If you asked, by the end of that year, the third graders what they wanted to listen to--'Sheep May Safely Graze' played by E. Power Biggs on the organ. Fourth graders; Mozart [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart], 'Symphony No. 40,' which they loved; fifth graders were into Gilbert and Sullivan [W.S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan]; sixth graders, we were doing things like 'The Young Person's Guide--' ['The Young Person's Guide to The Orchestra,' Benjamin Britten] there were things from all over the world. And I taught them how to folk dance. That was the other thing.
Story_ID: 443729
Speaker 1: So these three children [at Lincoln School, Gary, Indiana] had come out to learn how to folk dance 'cause I would go back over to Chicago [Illinois], and do some folk dancing with friends who had come out of the co-op camp where we did a lot of square dancing.  And so, oh, and, and we forgot about Ada Park [Chicago, Illinois] when I was a teenager in Morgan Park [Chicago, Illinois], Mr. Roberts [ph.].  That's got to be in there because even though I was going to the lab school [University of Chicago High School; University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois], I still had friends in Morgan Park.  And we, we did little square dancing things and fun things at Ada Park--was in Morgan Park, in my neighborhood.  Oh, we had a wonderful time.  Mr., Mr. Roberts and his wife, Marian Roberts [ph.], they mentored so many people.  And I think she's still living.  He died maybe about three or four years ago--wonderful people.  I mean, they raised a whole neighborhood out there.  And so, I mean, that was--anyway, that was fun.
Speaker 2: That was the spirit (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so--
Speaker 2: --in which you were working (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That was the spirit in which I was working, so--plus my experiences at Oberlin [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio].  And I wanted them to know music, plus my experiences at U High [University of Chicago High School], of the kinds of music that I learned and loved so much.  And in the Oberlin choir, you know, I wanted to share all this with people because it was--I had been a camp counselor [at Riseman Farm Camp, Michigan] my sophomore year when I needed to make money.  That's one of the things we got off of, and I was scared to death because getting up in front of people--I never did anything like that.  And I had to, but I had needed the money, and that was when the teaching bug hit me.  And I think I began to realize the effect on children of what I could share with them of music.  And I was a sophomore in, in college then.  So, that was my, my--college job in the summers to make money was as a music counselor.  And, and that's when I think the teaching bug really bit me.  And so, by the time I got to Gary [Indiana], I, I was, I was a fanatic about it sort of.  So, anyway, so I and, and here are these kids, and I was teaching with teachers who couldn't, you know--as the kids would say when kids would act up and stuff.  And I remember looking at them, and I'd say, "You know something, I don't have to teach you anything."  I said, "You know, you have lots of teachers that if--I'm going to get my paycheck, you know, whether I teach you anything or not, so why do you think I bother?" See, only a twenty-one year old can say that to a bunch of kids.  And just so, you know, it got them going.  So--and they were excited about the things that I could teach them, and we were having fun.  But they didn't want to come out and folk dance.  And so, not too long after that, I came home from lunch one day, and the kids were playing Double Dutch; girls playing Double Dutch.  And I said, "Ooh, can I jump?"  And I still had my big thick glasses, and I wore my hair pulled back, so I had a bun.  And I always had a pencil here, and a pencil here, and a pencil behind each ear, and I wore these zip-up shoes.  So, I was, you know, I was a bit of a fuddy-duddy, but not inside--just outside, but I'd always been different outside than inside.  So, I said, well, can I jump?  And they said, "Oh, hee, hee, hee, Ms. Tate [HistoryMaker Eileen Cline] wants to jump."  So, they let me jump, you know, very condescending, but what they didn't know was that Ms. Tate and my friend, Mary Jones [ph.], had been the Double Dutch champions in our neighborhood.  Nobody could outjump us.  So, I jumped the rest of the lunch hour, you know, kids where they'd have to change, you know, change people turning.  And I didn't miss, you know. It was just something; it was part of my athleticism, so I jumped the whole rest of the lunch hour, and the door--and the bell rang.  And I mean by then, there was this crowd of kids around (laughter), you know and, and they talked about that.  I didn't say anything.  I went on in, and taught the rest of my classes.  Then, later that week was another one of those serendipitous things as--I had a free period.  And I went out and the guys were playing ball, playing softball, and I wanted to play.  You know, I still, I was at that age where I still wanted to play (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You were only twenty-one (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, I said, well, can I bat?  I, I wasn't a very good fielder.  I was a half-way decent first baseman, but with my glasses and everything, I often couldn't react fast enough in, on the infield.  First base, I could handle.  And the field some--outfield sometimes, I wouldn't get the, you know, my glasses would get in the way, but I could play first base, but I didn't really like to.  I just liked to bat.  So, they said, yes, I could have a turn at bat.  Well, I was lucky--I hit a home run.  I was, I was good at batting.  And so, I did that and said, see you later, and went in to teach my class.  Well, about a week after that, I said, let's try the folk dancing again.  So, I brought it up in class.  And I said, you know, I was just thinking, I just learned a really neat dance.  And it would be kind of nice to learn some folk dances 'cause we were learning about music from all over the world anyway.  And I heard somebody say, as I was standing there--, "Huh, that square."  And I turned around there and I said, "Look, here, I know how to do everything you know how to do, right?"  Oh, I know what I said.  I taught the girls how to do the cha-cha.  That was--I had taught them how to do the cha-cha.  And so, I said, "I can do everything you can do, right?"  And they're sitting there, and they're thinking.  You know, I taught them how to do the cha-cha.  I could out-jump any of them in jump rope.  I could play ball better than most of the boys.  And I was sitting there.  I could let them just think about that.  And I said, "Now, how much of what I know, and I can do--do you know?  And you got--who square?"  I mean, I was, you know, neighborhood (unclear), I don't--.  And then, we let it go.  Forty kids came out, forty kids came out.  And we did, we had more fun, but what I was trying to get, and it wasn't--we still sang 'Rock-a My Soul in the Bosom of Abraham.'  We still sang 'I Got Shoes,' and we, it was what--what I was trying to do, and I think really worked, was to help them understand that they were a part of a much bigger world.  It wasn't that there was this world that was better than that world, but it was just that--there's more.  You know, you is fine, but look what you can do, you know, look what more.  So, that was a very important thing to me.
Story_ID: 443730
Speaker 1: And, meanwhile, halfway through my second year [as a music teacher at Lincoln School, Gary, Indiana], I got married to the guy [William Cline] that I had met when I was in college [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio].  He was a dishwasher in my dorm.  He was a sophomore and I was a freshman.  And then, he got sick part-way through his year, and dropped out of school for a while.  And nobody knew where he was, 'cause he was a really neat guy, and he had, he studied foreign languages and was just a lot of fun.  And everybody missed him.
Speaker 2: Was he black or white?
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's black--came from a large family in Mansfield, Ohio.  He was the middle of nine kids--four older brothers and sisters and four younger.  And the first one also in his family to go to college, and a younger sister who just really worshipped him--eventually, also went and got her Ph.D., and was an administrator at one of the community colleges in Denver [Colorado] 'til--and then she died about three years ago--I guess, two years ago.  But, anyway--.
Speaker 2: You met and married--I mean, you married what year (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I met him, I met him there.  We married in '58 [1958] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, it's 1958--
Speaker 1: --after, after we were out of school.
Speaker 2: --you married?
Speaker 1: --after we were out of school.
Speaker 2: So, that's where you were.
Speaker 1: But I met him there and, and, you know, we were, we were first good friends.  Of course, everybody wanted a boyfriend.  There weren't very many black kids there.  So, you know, we--I think sometimes I remember we thought once--I think we both felt, at a certain level, kind of that we were nice people, and nobody else wanted us.  You know what I mean?  It was--I certainly did not belong in the, our kind of people thing because I had kind of purposely left that.  I mean when, and, and when some of the Oberlin kids, Oberlin black kids, would go up to Cleveland [Ohio] to pledge Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority], for instance, and stuff like that, and I thought, oh, all right--well, I'll go with them 'cause they all said, well, you ought to go.  And I remember sitting in one of those groups.  And the minute somebody said, I am first a Delta, and then me, and I said, unh-uh.  And so, I didn't do that (laughter), you know.  It was just--I think I've just been a kind of a maverick all along 'cause I didn't want somebody else to tell me who I had to be and, and because I could see always people get locked in these boxes and then, they think what they can't do.
Speaker 2: So, in 1958, you married?
Speaker 1: Fifty-eight [1958], we got married.
Story_ID: 443731
Speaker 1: And then, on a total fluke, we--he [Cline's husband, William Cline] got an offer of a five-week assistantship in German out here [Colorado].  He was working as a, as a, as a technician in La Rabida heart sanitarium [La Rabida Children's Hospital, Chicago, Illinois], a hematologist, because he was just a brilliant guy, you know.  And, and he had taken a bunch of tests just to find where he could get a job 'cause he had just gotten out of the [U.S.] Army.  And I lived in Chicago [Illinois], and was working in Gary [Indiana].  And my, my mother [Inez Duke Tate]--just our family thing, you know--you don't get married until the guy has a job.  And so, and I had a job and so, he had to find a job.  And he, he got, he, he had a good friend that worked in a place in--on the North Side of Chicago.  And he was staying there, watching him total up these figures on something.  And before the guy got to the bottom, Bill [William Cline] gave him the answer.  So, they wanted to hire him there, but it was too far away.  So, somebody said well, go out to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], and take some tests, you know, some employment tests.  So, he did that, and they, you know, said all these things that he was good at.  And he ended up--there was an opening as a hematologist at La Rabida heart sanitarium.  And he'd never done anything like that, but he was really good at it.  And because of his personality, little kids who were sick would let him take their blood, and they wouldn't let anybody touch them.  But they would let him (laughter).  It was just--he was that kind of a, of a person.  But he, and he hadn't been able to find a job in, in foreign languages, which was really what he had decided to major in.  And he had never had a foreign language until he was nineteen, but he had a real linguistic gift.  And so, by the time he was out of college a bit and he was in the Army.  He was in Germany when he was in the Army.  He became bilingual, literally, in German and French.  And we have German friends who say they have never, ever known an American other than he who had not a trace, not a trace of an American accent.  You know, so some people have it--they're able to switch to the personality of the country, you know, because there's some things you can't say in some languages because the concept doesn't exist.  But, I mean, he was like, he could think French in France, he could think German in Germany.  He would never go to another person's country, whether it was Norway, or Italy, or Mexico, and expect them to speak his language.  So, he kind of, you know, was that kind of a--anyway, so we came out here.  He had a professor who met somebody, somebody from Oberlin [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio], who had met somebody out here, and told him about him.  And he offered him a five-week assistantship out here at the University of Colorado [Boulder, Colorado].  And we both quit our jobs--a lot--on the strength of a five-week thing (laughter).  Neither of us had ever been farther west than the Mississippi River, and just moved out to Colorado.  And we realized--if we thought about it for two minutes, we probably wouldn't have done it because it was nothing like security.  But it had come up in a way that it seemed like what we were led to do, so we did.  And five weeks went into ten and so, they gave him another five-week one, and then they said, would you like to stay the next year?  Well, we ended up staying twenty years.  And in the process, you know, I did all kinds of things.  We raised our kids [Jonathan Cline and Joy Cline Phinney] out here.  He taught foreign languages, first at the college, and then at the high school. He developed the whole high school program.  I taught piano.  I had an independent studio 'cause I didn't want to be away from my kids all day when they were little.  And I taught at the university some.  And I ran--but you're kind of--I started a Boulder Children's Choir. and you sort of do what's there.  Because of the way I told you my dad [Herman Tate] basically encouraged me all--I learned how to ski.  I learned how to climb mountains.  I learned how to climb mountains partly 'cause I knew that my son--I found out he wanted to, and it scared me to death.  And I decided--I said, you don't climb anything until you take the mountaineering school.  And I thought--'cause he came home one day and said, "Mom, is it better to climb in hiking boots or sneakers?"  And I said, "Where have you been?"  Well, they'd been climbing on a rock wall down some place.  And I said, "You don't climb in anything until you take the mountaineering school."  So, I decided--'cause the guy who ran it, was a good friend of mine.  And I decided, I would do it first, so I would really know what it was about.  So, I learned how to climb mountains--had a blast.  I mean, you know, to be able to rappel off of a cliff; terrifying, but, you know, when you're in that situation, you just do it.  And then, you discover (laughter), you know, when you're part-way through.  Whoa, this is incredible because it's all about learning how first, you know, learning the principles, getting the skills, and then trying them.
Story_ID: 443732
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, let's talk about the '70s [1970s] because you just blew through it all so fast.
Speaker 2: I haven't yet.  This is still (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so good.
Speaker 2: --this is still the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Nineteen, the six--so the '60s [1960s], you are in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We are in Boulder, Colorado--
Speaker 1: --in Boulder, Colorado.
Speaker 2: --which was second only to Haight-Ashbury [San Francisco, California], as far as what was going then.  So, I mean, we were all kind of crazy.  We all kind of grew up, had our adolescence, all of that stuff out here then, with all kinds of people.
Speaker 1: What was happening here at the time?  You said it was only second to--.
Speaker 2: Oh, I mean, it was, it was--as my daughter [Joy Cline Phinney] said, everybody--everybody was doing everything they were big enough to do.  You know, I mean, there was just a little bit of everything.  And, fortunately, we noticed that--I mean, there was drugs, there was all kinds of it.  It was the, I'm okay, you're okay, marriage swapping.  Everybody did everything.  It was kind of that sort of thing.  And, yet, if you have sort of a center about your life and, yet, I mean these are all--you mean everybody.  It was kind of a small town then in a way, so everybody knew everybody.  And everybody was kind of accepting of everybody.  And everybody was kind of working out their own thing.  And that was good, that was good enough (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was the, what was the first job you, the first job in music that you were able to get under your belt out here, once you moved out to Boulder?
Speaker 2: I was offered a job almost right away as a middle school music teacher.  But, see, I didn't want to do that because I would had to be away all day, and I had small children.  I did it one semester just to fill in for somebody who had died suddenly.  But I decided that I wanted to open an independent piano studio because that way, I could do my own thing.  And I also taught some at the university [University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado] and that was flexible.  And I had an organ job, you know, I just--
Speaker 1: You were a musician--
Speaker 2: I did what I could do.
Speaker 1: --you were a musician?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, and I did, you know, we had, we needed money.  And I did what I was able to do (sigh).  And so, then, we toward the--I think, in 1969, we went to Swarthmore [Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, Pennsylvania] for a year because my husband [William Cline] was offered a position as assistant, assistant dean of something or other in student affairs--
Speaker 1: When was the--
Speaker 2: --in student affairs.
Speaker 1: --I'm sorry, when was the first child born?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty [1960]--
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty [1960], and then the second?
Speaker 2: --and the second one in 1962.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So by the time when they were, they were coming of age to start school themselves, and you were--they were looking at, at you the way you were seeing your parents at that same age.
Speaker 2: I don't know that they paid much attention (laughter).  I mean, there was so much going on in this town.  I mean, the kids, kids could learn anything.  I mean, they were--even things like--I couldn't learn how to swim when I was growing up because you weren't allowed to go to the swimming pools and the beach.  And, you know, my kids, when they were three, you know, were fish, you know.  And I, I just wanted them to know how to do everything.  And they skied, and they did, you know, just about everything.
Story_ID: 443733
Speaker 1: But you were still, on some level--and I, I know you'll tell me--but the, the '60s [1960s] were still very turbulent.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: You were still having to deal with race relations.
Speaker 2: But not as much out here [Colorado] in the same way as when I was back east, not as much as when I lived in Chicago [Illinois], and not as much as what everybody was dealing with on the East Coast, except that we were there a lot.  You know, so, I mean, it, it was just part of like--this was like being able to catch your breath, because a lot of what we were dealing with out here--you know, people weren't teaching black history, or didn't know anything about--.  My dau-, my daughter [Joy Cline Phinney] would just simply take her comic books to school, and teach them about Harriet Tubman, and everybody else.  I mean, because I thought, well, why should they know?  You know, I mean, if--I'm not going to get all bent out of joint because they don't know anything about black people if black people don't tell them.  So, that's what we did, you know.  And, and we knew so we shared that.  And so, among, you know, my whole mix of friends out here, it, it was sort of like, you know, it's not that you didn't think you were black 'cause, you know, how some people say, you don't think you're black.  So, we'd say, well, tell me that means, you know.  Yeah, I grew up on the South Side of Chicago, all right.  Don't forget that.
Speaker 1: Had you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But it was almost as if you were black in the same way that some people have red hair, you know, in terms of, of a lot of our relationship because that was basically the way I was kind of determined to see it.  I suppose that has to be part of it.  And this was a place where that was possible.
Speaker 1: Because there were so few black people out here that you were their exposure to--?
Speaker 2: Partly that, partly that, but, you know, people came, people out here mostly then came from all kinds of other places, too, you know, so that you were doing lots of other things.  And you didn't, you just kind of didn't allow that to be an issue with other things.  I mean, as an issue, it's an issue, but there's so many parts of life when it doesn't--it isn't going to be an issue if you don't allow it to be an issue.  I mean, I'm not going to wait for somebody to say, I can belong to this musical organization, but maybe I can't, because I'm black.  I mean, that's nonsense to me, you know, and I was willing to tell them, but that never came up that way.  But I do remember that I was asked to be on the board of the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association] at the university [University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado]--
Speaker 1: What year?
Speaker 2: --when I was--just come here.  I think it must have been 1959.  And I was in these meetings, 'cause the person who had invited me, had been a friend of a friend of my mother's [Inez Duke Tate] somewhere at, you know, in Wisconsin at some YWCA thing.  And so, she invited me, and I was the youngest person on the board.  But I remember we were struggling with some problem to solve, and I sat there, and it was another one of those epiphanies, like on the airplane was.  And I suddenly thought, what I knew intellectually, but in my gut for the first time, I suddenly thought, you know, white people don't have the answer.  I don't know why that came to me that way.  You know, I knew that, but I think that when you live in a country like ours, and you go through the things, that somewhere in the psyche, people feel, and I think still, a lot of people feel, somewhere the white man has the answer.  And it just hit me with, so--white man doesn't have the answer.  Everybody is searching for answers.  And people will follow you if you're green, if they think you really know where you're going (laughter).  I mean, so that was a really important moment.
Story_ID: 443734
Speaker 1: I think it means that if you--you know, I never waited to be accepted in this social group, or that social group, or that social group in the same way that--I mean, I and my kids [Jonathan Cline and Joy Cline Phinney], probably we would have never been invited to join Jack and Jill [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.] or something, but I knew people who did.  But if I wanted a social life, I would make it happen.  People in this area still talk about the Cline Friday night music thing.  I mean, we used to have music at our house on Friday night.  We lived up on the hill.  We left in 1978.  And, you know, when I came back here last year--we'd come back and visit everything.  People still--a week doesn't go by where somebody doesn't say, are you ever going to do the Cline Friday nights again because it was just open for people to come.  And we would talk about music, and we would play music, and people would ask for things and stuff.  I think that--and I've basically done a similar thing every place I've lived.  You know, when I was in New Haven [Connecticut], when I was in Maryland, and, you know, what living in Baltimore [Maryland] is like.  Well, I--yeah, I didn't need to be compartmentalized, so I would kind of bring people together (laughter), you know, all the different people I knew.  And they would have a good time around, around an, around a love of music, around the love of bringing potluck, and having good food.  I mean, I think this is the bridge thing in me because understanding and knowing so many different people from so many different backgrounds, whether it's racial or ethnic or whatever, and seeing their commonalities.  And so, being able to get people together, and within no time at all, they see their commonalities.  And so, every time I've moved away from some place, I feel that I have offered that.  Amy [Cline's sister, HistoryMaker Amy Tate Billingsley] can tell you this because Amy used to have this thing where, you know, she loved name tags.  And so, we'd have these big things.  We started having them at my house in Maryland.  She wanted name tags.  I said, I don't want name tags.  So, what we decided to do, instead, was we made a rule, which lasts to this day in our household, is when we have a gathering of people, everybody who comes in has to find five people they've never met before, and tell them three things about themselves.  And so, if everybody has to do that, nobody feels awkward.  It's fascinating to see the people from I don't know where--Timbuktu [Mali], wherever--two people meet each other, and in the process of each one of them telling three things about themselves, a connection happens, you know.  I think, maybe in a way, I've told you a lot of the essence of what I hope to be able to offer.  I have young people that, when I was dean at Peabody [Peabody Conservatory of Music; Peabody Institute, Baltimore, Maryland], who really got that.
Story_ID: 443735
Speaker 1: Well, I want to talk about that because that happens in 1983.  And I want to know how--
Speaker 2: That happens in 1983--how did I get there.
Speaker 1: I want to know how it came, how it came out about, right, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  19--
Speaker 1: Because in '78 [1978]--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --you were still, you were doing Cline's Friday nights.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in '69 [1969], we spent a year in Swarthmore [Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, Pennsylvania].  That was the year of Kent [Kent State shootings].  And there were a--I--there's no point in going into all of that.  But it was interesting because we lived in Benjamin West House, which was that old historic house there.  And kids would come through.  And my husband [William Cline] basically was doing a lot of sort of mentoring of the black students on campus at Swarthmore.  One of the young students, who came through then, was Skip Gates [HistoryMaker Henry Louis "Skip" Gates, Jr.] it turned--somebody reminded me later, you know, when Skip came through, we'd feed him, and talk with him, and stuff.  But we decided at the end of that year--it's funny--we made a conscious decision to come back to Boulder [Colorado] because it was such a hurting time on the East Coast.  And we wanted specifically--so we wanted our children [Jonathan Cline and Joy Cline Phinney] to grow up where people loved each other.  Isn't that funny?  I mean, there was more of a sense of that here than, than it was where we were, and less segregation, mental segregation, as much as anything.
Story_ID: 443736
Speaker 1: In '78 [1978]--oh, well, in 1974--I mean we have to go by this, it's 1974, because a lot of young people were full of all this, we got divorced; kind of everybody was doing that then.  You know, do your own thing and stuff, so we got divorced.  And I went off to graduate school.  I got a Danforth Fellowship.  I went to do my doctorate at Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana].  Our son went to Northfield Mount Hermon School [Gill, Massachusetts], 'cause he wanted to--in Massachusetts--'cause he wanted to learn Latin and stuff like that.  And, and I think they had coed soccer, they had soccer, which they didn't have here [Colorado] at the time.  And I took our thirteen-year-old daughter [Joy Cline Phinney] with us, so it was very interesting years, but it was challenging.  So, but during that year, I remember thinking I was excited about the new things I was learning, what I could do.  And it was good for our daughter in many ways which--the things she was learning.  And it was good for Jon [Jonathan Cline], our son.  It was time for them to get out of Boulder [Colorado].  I mean, it was too--something was too narrow in terms of their exposure to the rest of the world.  And I didn't want them to be here that much any longer.  So, I--it seemed like it was good for us.  But at that point, my husband [William Cline], who had thought that was what he wanted to do, he really wasn't very happy.  And I thought, anything that happens that's really right, has to be right for everybody.  And so, that kind of tugged at me.  And I also realized that a lot of the things I think that I kind of probably felt were problems between us, I carried right with me (laughter).  So, we were talking the next summer.  We went together to a camp, to a camp that they had gone to, to parents' weekend, and we got to talking.  And we decided--we figured that for both of us, all the other things we were doing, the most important thing was the children, and that it was easier to do that together than apart.  So, we got married again, so we did that.  And he and I (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, it's the '70s [1970s] (laughter).
Speaker 1: So we got married, then we got divorced, and got married again in about a year and a half later.  And it's really funny, I remember virtually nothing about any of that--just, you know, we just kind of went on with life.
Story_ID: 443737
Speaker 1: And then, in '78 [1978], he [Cline's husband, William Cline] got an appointment as a visiting scholar at Educational Testing Service [ETS] in Princeton [New Jersey].  And so, we moved to Princeton.  And he died a month later.  So, we had rented out our house here [Colorado], we couldn't go back home.  This was when we were going to really get on our feet.  We had no money saved for college.  I had no job.  It was--that was just it.  And now was that Job moment, you know, and I remember we came back from the service here.  And I had to go to do something for my degree.  I had a grant to do some interviews in England.  I was taking one of the kids [Jonathan Cline and Joy Cline Phinney] with me, and the other one was going to be with, with, with their, with his dad.  And, of course, then, we had to take him.  It was just all very complicated.  But-- and they were both then going to go to Northfield Mount Hermon School [Gill, Massachusetts], 'cause we had decided to send her, rather than have her for the fourth year in a row in a different school.  And as a black teenager, sixteen years old, in a city like Princeton, it would be better for her to be with him in a place where they knew him.  And she could stay for two years 'cause she would be a junior.  It was the most fortunate thing because I don't know what I would have done at the end of August.  Here we were, and, you know, at least, they were set for school.  And I didn't--and I only had me to figure out, what am I going to do now?  So, I'm out here in the middle of Plainsboro, New Jersey--unpacked boxes still, couldn't go back home.  I had my VW [Volkswagen] bus which we always drove around in.  And I did what we had to do--got them in school.  And I was just driving back from everything, and I got off the Turnpike [New Jersey Turnpike].  I'm driving back to this apartment.  And all of a sudden, it hit me.  Now, before that, we had a memorial service in Boulder [Colorado] that was unbelievable.  People were lined up all down the block because he was so much loved, you know, kids, everybody, and that was very supportive.  So, all of this goes by, and you just hit the floor running with something like this.  And I'm driving back to this apartment, this empty apartment.  And everybody's more or less settled, and then it hit me.  And just then, I turned on the radio, and there was an interview with [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou--yeah.  Why do these things happen?  And somebody was just asking her about her life--and hadn't there been an awful lot of pressure?  And she said, "Let me tell you about pressure."  And I'm listening--interesting.  "Take a lesson from Mother Nature.  When there is the greatest amount of pressure, what do you get?  Diamonds!  And when there is less pressure, what comes next?  Coal!  And when there is less pressure?  Carbon!"  I don't mean to have it (unclear). "And when there is no pressure at all?  Just plain dirt!"  And I thought, that's a message for me--I've got to make diamonds.  And, you know, you just hear that at the right time in your life.  I shared that story with almost every convocation I gave when I was a dean [at Peabody Conservatory of Music; Peabody Institute, Baltimore, Maryland] because it helps people, you know.  So, anyway, so I went back and I--every morning, I would get up, and I would think like Job.  I'd say, okay, Lord, what do you want me to do today --'cause there weren't any answers.  And one thing and then another, just gradually unfolded.  I went back to Bloomington [Indiana], lived in one room for a couple of, couple of years.  The kids would come home.  We'd live in that one room, and I'd work on my thing.
Story_ID: 443738
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Ultimately--and I would get in my bus, and travel up to, you know, however long it took to get from Bloomington, Indiana up to Northfield, Massachusetts where my kids were in a track meet.  They were both really good tracks--track people.  And I remember I had a piano professor who thought I was nuts, you know, that I'd get in the--weekend--I would get in my bus, and I'd drive that far up and, and back again.  And I said to her, I said, you know, when my husband [William Cline] was alive, he never missed anything these kids were in.  He'd never missed a track meet.  I'm not going to miss one now.  I mean, this was a hard year for them.  And we're going to make it as normal as possible, and I'm going to be there (laughter).  It was hilarious.  They [Northfield Mount Hermon School, Gill, Massachusetts] had two campuses--it was Mount Hermon [Massachusetts] and Northfield, and you pass Mount Hermon first to get over to Northfield.  And I would get over there, and they would know I was coming; 'cause I had this green VW [Volkswagen] bus, and some kid would see my bus, and they'd call and say, "Jon [Jonathan Cline], Joy [Joy Cline Phinney], your mom is coming (laughter)," you know.  And I was just, you know, I was a gypsy for a long time.  And then, I, I got, very fortunately, I got a job as executive director of Neighborhood Music School in New Haven, Connecticut. 'Cause I realized I had to get a job.  I--my, my grant was taking me through my graduate school stuff, you know, and I could afford to live in my student housing, and everything.  But, obviously, I was going to have to get a job.  And I didn't have, I didn't have a formal resume.  You know, I had never had a real bona fide college appointment that way.  You know, I had, I ran a program here [University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado] because nobody was doing it.  And I thought it needed it to be done, and they let me develop it.  But that's not the same as sort of going through the ranks of, of academe.  But what I did was, I put down--I had met somebody who was, had ended up--a guy who was the dean of the music school at Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] that I met at a meeting.  And it turned out to have been Andy Billingsley's [Andrew Billingsley] roommate, when Andy was on an exchange thing at Grinnell [Grinnell College, Grinnell, Iowa] years before.  You know, things kind of happen, and you meet people.  And one way and then another, I ended up in New Haven as executive director of this school.  And when I had been trying to put a resume together, what I decided to do was to do it in terms of areas of experience, because I had done lots of volunteering; I had done, you know, I had been on volunteer boards; I had done independent things and everything, so I just tried to say, I have experience in these areas.  And I ended up doing that.
Story_ID: 443739
Speaker 1: We did interesting things at Neighborhood Music School [New Haven, Connecticut].  Oh, I think, I think, for the first time, we brought children from--what I sort of challenged them when they interviewed me with their black branch on the hill.  And they had this lovely new, newer school downtown.  And so, I would go out in my bus, and bring kids down there, so that they could experience a different kind of environment.
Speaker 2: And just to set it up, this is in New Haven [Connecticut] and the job--.
Speaker 1: This is in New Haven at Neighborhood Music School.  I was executive director.  It was a very interesting organizational and political situation and, and experience.  We also started a--we did things like ORF [Oral Reading Fluency] for cerebral palsy kids and things like--it was a very interesting experience.  I was not as experienced as I probably should have been.  But on the other hand, if I had been, probably wouldn't have gotten as much done in a certain way because when you don't really know, when you haven't really gone through the lockstep that everybody else goes through, then you also are not confined by what people say isn't possible.  You know, you just go do it.  So anyway, I was there for that period of time.
Story_ID: 443740
Speaker 1: And then, by a total other fluke, I became associate dean of the Peabody Conservatory [Peabody Conservatory of Music; Peabody Institute] in Baltimore [Maryland].  And if anybody really is interested in that, then they'll just going to have to read this book that I have to get written eventually, but I'm not going to go into now.  But it was, again, just one of those things that just somebody had a need.  And when young people ask me, how do you get to do this from that, I said, everybody can go to school a certain amount.  And everybody can network, and all this stuff, but the most important thing is to believe in something, educate yourself, do it as well as you can, really believe in its purpose, have a purpose for it.  The world has such needs.  And the opportunity will find you because the needs are so great.  And in each one of the things I went into, there was a situation where they had a need.  And what I understood and could do, could fit that need, even though I didn't come through the usual channels to do that.  So, I ended up doing that.  And I was the associate dean at Peabody.  And, of course, everybody that I ever met around then always said I had to be the dean of students 'cause that's all they let black folks do by then.  Certainly, the dean of women, I would have been--I mean, as a woman, I certainly would have been the dean of students.  But to have then to be the associate dean of student affairs, you know, of everybody, was kind of unusual, but it wasn't to me, because why not?  And then the following year, because the person who was then the dean, became the director of the institute.  And he said, "Well, would you please be the dean?"  And I'm thinking, I'm just barely learning how to be an associate dean, but that's what I did.  So, I did that for about thirteen years.  And I'm afraid I caused all kinds of trouble because, again, if, if you go someplace and, and sometimes people think they're kind of doing you a favor to let you have this job or, you know, they're being liberal or whatever, but rarely do they think that you really are going to do something.  So and, and I mean this is beyond anything.  If you have a sense of mission, and you go somewhere, and you need to make a difference, and you can see how to make a difference, you're going to do it.  And, and people don't like change, you know, organizations don't like change.  It's like, people don't like their furniture moved because you're going to fall over if you walk through it--the house in the dark.  So, I learned a lot.  I hated the, the, the term politics, you know.  I didn't like the term power, or being, or having power, or something like that.  That was kind of antithetical to what I thought my family's philosophy was, growing up.  But I have to tell you--when you see a situation where you know that you can help kids, and sometimes it is because they are being kept out, or kept back because of race, or not because they weren't being understood.  Sometimes it was Middle Eastern kids.  Sometimes it was Asian kids.  You know, when you're dealing with a, an institution that sometimes is, is populated a lot by people who mean well, but who have had no experience right outside of their own, you know, sort of cultural field; but when you know better, you've got to make a difference.  You can't just sort of go along with things, so I didn't go along with things.  And when you can see that and do it--I want to tell you when I could see something that was wrong, and I could say to the people in the institution that it needed to be this way, and basically, they would say, do we have to do it?  And I'd say yes.  That's when I liked the concept of power.  You know, and I think if it's well-used--it was probably many years later that I really began to understand more.  I mean, I learned more in hindsight about how much more effective I probably would have been if I had, had more political savvy.  And I've never had very much political savvy.  All I've just had is a lot of passion (laughter), a lot of heart, and a lot of determination that if it's right, there's got to be a way to do it.  And I think that was effective.
Story_ID: 443741
Speaker 1: And you can take it out of my, my retirement program.  It'll tell what some of the, the statistics of what happened there relative to the, the access and the success of African American students at Peabody [Peabody Conservatory of Music; Peabody Institute, Baltimore, Maryland], which was such (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I want you to tell me a little about that--.
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, but, but in no time at all, we had more African American students there than in any other major conservatory in the country.  And not only that, somebody noticed one day at one point that I think almost every principal player in our orchestra was African American, not because they were African American--because they really were the best kids.  And everybody recognized that they were the best ones.  And the most important thing was that they recognized that they could do this, that, that, this was what, where they belonged.  And I think, and, you know, not too long after I left, that was not the case anymore.  You know, it's, it's subtle, but when you can be in a position where you are the shepherd, or the steward of everybody, you know, not just some people, everybody gets it a lot more.  You know, it's not like, and there were always some people that say well, you know, you'll going to be partial to the black kids.  And, of course, then they would quickly find out--no, that wasn't the case (laughter) at all.  But you have to--we were fortunate.  We were in a small enough kind of environment that I could kind of have my finger on everything and, and not back off of anything.  And it wore me out; but I loved it because, you know, my kids [Jonathan Cline and Joy Cline Phinney] were then old enough, and enough on their own that I could really give this my full time attention, except I still was being a parent of, of college, and then beyond college 'cause I had to be the breadwin-, breadwinner.  I had to do everything.  I had to be mom, pop.  I remember somebody, somebody once said, "Why didn't you ever get married again?"  And I said, "When (laughter)?"  It was just--and yet, you know, I've, I've had a, a very happy life.  I've enjoyed lots of things, but I think it's because it's been the, it's been the, the thing again of that underlying thing that I told you before.  It's always--what am I supposed to do with the gift of my life?  And it's always been--
Speaker 2: And what do you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) something to do.
Speaker 2: Some-, something to do.
Story_ID: 443742
Speaker 1: So, what do you think you're supposed to do?  When you, when you ask yourself that question, what's the answer?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure that, that--I don't ask myself that question.  It's just there.  It's, it's a driving force, which means that whatever, whatever comes to my consciousness that, that I can relate to and do, is what I do.  And right now (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now music has been a big part of that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How, how does, how, how does music, how do, how do you answer the question within music then?  How, how has music been that?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think it's been my big encouragement.  It's been the thing that has helped me, and I think everybody that I've worked--it's, it's been like the tool that I could help kids, for instance, you know, young people who want to go into music, and even those who don't, that there is something here that requires a disciple.  It requires an understanding.  It requires a development of character, and everything--that the feel of music is one of the few places where you can get that.  You can't cheat.  You can't short circuit it.  If you don't put it in right in, you're not going to get it out.  And, yet, there's no reason that you can't do anything with it.  You just have to figure out--what can I do in terms of my skills and my understanding, and then look at the world, and understand the world enough.  I think it's very important to get an overall education which is what I said to you earlier.  It isn't just about music because if, if young people don't learn--I mean, they need to learn math, they need to learn science, they need to learn all of it--history, so that they can see where they fit, and where all of this fit, and what the needs are because I used to give this talk to parents when they would come, you know, when their kids are coming to audition and stuff.  And I'd say, in five years, none of us know what the world is going to be like.  So, you can't say, my kid is going to be a great piano player (background noise), or my kid is going to be a great trombone player.
Story_ID: 443743
Speaker 1: You were telling me this without me having asked you, but I would like to know, what would you like to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: Oh, interesting--to help build bridges between people, to help anybody I ever come in contact with, understand on any level of their lives that they don't have to accept less.  And this is a lot of what I've gotten from the spirit of music, from the basic religious spirit--I guess you would call it, of, of my life, of what I understand God to be as everywhere, everything.  And so, what's to keep, you know, the whole thing?  If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there, I am there.  If you put yourself down wherever, I'm still there.  And all we have to do is know it.  And as far as the music thing is concerned, it just thrills me that there are so many young people, and many of them African Americans now, who know that they can do what anybody else can do.  I mean, there's a group called the Ritz Chamber Players right now who--the corps of them came out of Peabody [Peabody Conservatory of Music; Peabody Institute, Baltimore, Maryland].  I mean, Terrance Patterson was a clarinet player there.  But, and I think there was something about the spirit, you know.  Troy Stuart is a fabulous cellist.  Amadi Hummings used to spend a lot of time at our house.  He wasn't at Peabody, but he was sort a part of all of this.  They'd make their music at our house and stuff with everybody.  And I think that they're just--I hope that a lot of the spirit of what I was trying to convey is part of what has made them know that this is their world.  They have something to give.  They are doing a fabulous job of doing it.  And they can do it anywhere with anybody, you know, in any orchestra, in any--and--or not in an orchestra, or starting their own thing, which is what the Ritz Chamber Players have done.  And, yeah, I want to be remembered for that--I mean, because, because it's not, not me as a person. Oh and then, when I left Peabody, by the way, in '95 [1995], I went to be the--at the Institute for Policy Studies at Johns Hopkins [Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland], which is part of it, as a senior university fellow in arts policy.  And, again, it was about the arts as the lifeblood of this country and of the world, really.  And that includes everybody, you know, it's not just some people.  I love all kinds of music, you know.  I can do most anything.  But if, if what I'm remembered for is a spirit that says, you can transcend any barrier that says that you cannot.  You just have to figure it out.  And the whole lesson of you can figure it out is something I gave at a convocation once.  And, and a young person who had lots, lots of problems came bursting into my office one day.  And I was telling her how my dad [Herman Tate] used to say that.  You know, we would have these deep discussions.  And I would try to get him to help me, you know, how do I do this, how do I do that?  And he'd go through all of the factors, and help me think through the factors, but I would want him, desperately, tell me the answer.  And he wouldn't tell me the answer.  And, basically, he would say, you can figure it out.  So, this kid comes into my office one day, and he was all excited.  He said, "You know, what?"  This is after the convocation at which I told that story.  He said, "I had this big problem, and it was (unclear), and I was worrying about this, and I was trying to figure out that, and I was going to come and see you.  And all of a sudden, I thought, you know, what she's going to say to me?  She's going to say, 'You can figure it out.'"  And he said, "You know what, I did."
Story_ID: 443744
Speaker 1: Oh, and then I have twin grandchildren who are now, were just seven last week, and that's the other half of my life right now--I spend about half of my life since they were born.  They were born three weeks right after I retired and their mother (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You retired in 1999?
Speaker 1: Ninety-nine [1999].  Their parents--their mother [Joy Cline Phinney] is a professional pianist, and their father [A.W. Phinney, III] is a lawyer.  And, you know, what it can be like to have twins anyway.  And so, I know what it meant to me to have my family, and my grandparents around, and everything.  And so, I've spent about half my time, wherever I've lived since then, helping with them.  And either I am there, or they're here [Colorado]--they're here right now.  But also, my daughter and her husband  sort of fixed up their house, so that I've got--you know, I would, whatever it is--I can make myself at home anywhere.  But I've got a little spot where I can not be in their hair all the time, and I can help out, and then I can come home.
Story_ID: 443745
Speaker 1: I'm on some boards still, and stuff like that.
Speaker 2: What boards are you on?
Speaker 1: Well, I'm on the Marlboro music board and--
Speaker 2: And there's the Marlboro Music Festival [Marlboro, Vermont]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, it's, it's that.  And I was on the American Symphony Orchestra League board as long as one could do that.  Lots of things, but it's not--you know, one can be impressed or not, but the point is that where it's been possible, I've just tried to contribute.  And I've been trying to get off of various boards.  But then, I still, you know, consult and give talks, and stuff like that because I think it's nice to be able to be, at this stage in my life, in a position where I can be as, as objective a contributor as possible, like nobody owns me (laughter).  You know, no group owns me, so I can, can, can help bring to light the, the values of various things as they can be useful to people.  So, I still am trying to do that kind of thing and help with the kids (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, let me ask you this.  You becoming, at that moment, at which you said--
Speaker 1: I'm trying to write.
Speaker 2: --and you're writing more.
Story_ID: 443746
Speaker 1: And the moment at which you said that it, it dawned on you: I really want to teach.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you remember that moment you had that--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --sort of about the cloud moment, I want to teach?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no, I didn't say I wanted to teach.  Above the cloud meant that, that anything was possible (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Anything was possible.
Speaker 2: --but it was at the camp thing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, but meaning--
Speaker 2: --when the, the passion to teach, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, it was that sort of awareness that you have--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --that, the passion to teach.  What or, if any, newfound respect did you have for your mother [Inez Duke Tate] as a teacher?
Speaker 2: Oh, great, great (laughter).  You, you really hit something that I, I think about that every now and then.  But I think I hit such a profound respect for my mother, even when I was in college [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio], you know, when--because my father [Herman Tate] was gone.  And I never sort of thought of my mother that way.  But, you know, I could have a really big problem, and I could call, and it was expensive to call long distance then and stuff.  But I could call home any time, and I could talk and talk and talk, and she would say, you know, dear, call whenever you want to.  And I would hang up the phone and burst into tears (laughter).  So, I mean, yeah, I mean, who she was, and her kind of steady sort of thing that she was, always was all of my life, just became more and more meaningful to me.  I understood it more and more as I got older.
Speaker 1: And you said something about Amy [Cline's sister, HistoryMaker Amy Tate Billingsley] that I want to have you just repeat.
Speaker 2: Amy--it's funny, we are so different.  I mean, it's, it's much more different that being tall and not tall.  But this is something parents can do, and I would always encourage all parents to do.  They taught us to love each other, and they taught us to care about each other.  You have to teach children that, and they did, and about our families, and we have always been close.  She has always been in my heart.  I've always wanted to take care of her, and she's done the same for me in a different way, even though there--we believe different things on lots of things.  We think different ways, but fundamentally, I think we each care about each other more than we do about anybody.  And I have always been able, if I was in whatever crisis, I could pick up the phone, call Amy at three o' clock in the morning.  And her first thing is not why did you wake me up out of a sound sleep?  It was always--what can I do for you, you know, what do you need?  And I know, I'm not the only person that Amy has done this for.  I think she has to be this way with everybody because that's the way she is.  She's a helper.  No matter what problems somebody has, if it comes to her, she says, how can I help?  So, that's--the world needs more people like that.
Speaker 1: Well, we thank you for your story.
Story_ID: 443747
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We look forward to the book.
Speaker 2: Oh, my, there are four of them (laughter) on different subjects.  You need (unclear) (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, just tell me the four subjects.
Speaker 2: Well, one, I'd done a major study on piano competitions, which was one reason I was on the Van Cliburn jury in 2001.  There was a documentary of that.  I was trying to hide 'cause I didn't want to be on a documentary.  One is a set of personal essays called 'Not the Usual' [ph.].  One is--has grown out of a, a research project that I did for Johns Hopkins [Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland] on 'Success Factors in Twenty-Five Major Music Schools' [ph.], and something will, will grow out of that.  And another one is probably more personal than I can describe right now, that is more philosophical.  But, and then, of course, there's a fifth one on--I have a collection of Internet humor that has about six hundred and eighty jokes in it (laughter).  I would love to publish the best of those.  But thank you.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.
Story_ID: 443748
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm ready, if you could tell me about this.
Speaker 2: What?  Oh, I'm supposed to tell you about this picture?
Speaker 1: Just who's in it, and the date.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  This is Eileen [HistoryMaker Eileen Cline] on the left, who was too tall to stand up, and Amy [HistoryMaker Amy Tate Billingsley] on the right, my little sister, who's only a year and a half younger, but already, I was so tall they made me sit down.  And this was--I think, 1942, it says in the corner, but it's, it's, it says 12-12-42 [December 12, 1942].  And this must have been something that our parents had done, and we gave to people because it says, lovingly, which is my mother's way of saying things--lovingly, Eileen and Amy for--can I, can I--
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: --can I move it just (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm ready.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: What's your best guess?
Speaker 2: This is a family picture that may have been taken around 1950, 1949, or '50 [1950].  And in the front row is Amy.  Next to her is my Grandma Vesey [Salina Harris Vesey], my father's mother.  Next to her is my mother, Inez Duke Tate.  Behind her is me, Eileen, trying not to look taller than my father, who was standing next to me, Herman Tate.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, ready.
Speaker 2: This is me when I was a dean at the Peabody Conservatory of Music [Peabody Institute, Baltimore, Maryland] with Steven Muller, who was--had been for almost twenty years the president of Johns Hopkins University [Baltimore, Maryland].  And we had just given him the Peabody medal for distinguished service.  And that what's around his neck.  I had just put it on him (laughter).

Speaker 1: I'm Denise Gines, the interviewer for The HistoryMakers, and Matthew Hickey is the videographer.  This is a supplement to an earlier interview done in 2006.  Would you please state your name and spell it for me, please?
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Eileen Cline, E-I-L-E-E-N, C-L-I-N-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And today's date?
Speaker 2: Today, oh, my, you didn't, let's see, today is Friday, November 7th, 2008.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the location of this interview?
Speaker 2: We are at my home in Louisville, Colorado.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your occupation or former occupation?
Speaker 2: Arts, arts administrator, teacher, consultant; you name it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think if, I think that what, what I would say is that I have basically, all of my life, been a teacher in one way or another, and I think of being a facilitator, so that's my profession (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: I would say, that's my life.
Story_ID: 443750
Speaker 1: Since this is a supplement, we're going to go back through your life again, and just add some things that we felt were just so important to not include in your life story.  And if we could, start with your childhood, and the fact that you lived in the Rosenwald building [Rosenwald Apartments; Michigan Boulevard Apartments, Chicago, Illinois].  Can you tell me what was the Rosenwald building--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --where it was, and, and life there?
Speaker 2: The Rosenwald building was--I thought of it as kind of a Garden of Eden right in the middle--it was an oasis in the middle of the Black Belt in Chicago [Illinois] in the '30s [1930s] and '40s [1940s].  It ringed the city block and I loved it.  I think we all did.  It, it had--it wasn't that it was a lot of fancy, wealthy people or anything like that.  We were just normal people, a lot of teachers and post office workers and so on; by and large, people who were relatively well-educated.  I remember that on one side of the building across Dearborn Street, as you got more and more towards State Street, the neighborhoods got poorer, and poorer, and poorer, but that's where we went to kindergarten before we moved.  On the other side on Michigan Avenue, you had really very nice big homes of the kind that I couldn't imagine really ever living in.  And if you really went farther over to South Parkway [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive], you had a whole, just more of, more of humanity.  It was where the Regal Ballroom [sic. Regal Theater, Chicago, Illinois] was, and it was a just very, very rich place to grow up.  A block away was the Hall Library [George Cleveland Hall Branch Library, Chicago, Illinois]--I'm thinking about now--Hall Branch Library.  So, we were in the middle of a, of a wonderful cultural place to grow up.  Inside the building, I remember there were entrances that were actually kind of thick, because there were apartments that were over some of them.  And there were five stories in the building.  And there was a roof where--I, I, I know I wasn't more than five or six, but, boy, we'd go up and explore that roof.  And, I, I think that now, people would really worry about their kids doing that, but I don't think our parents [Inez Duke Tate and Herman Tate] worried.  They knew we had reasonable good sense.  We'd explore all the corridors down in, in the basement.  There was a social room.  There was a nursery school [Rosenwald Nursery School, Chicago, Illinois].  There must have been storage areas down there, but there were corridors that went around the whole block.  And we just loved the feeling, like we could explore it.  And up on the roof, I remember it just felt like you could see forever.  So, that probably was a very important thing in my life of feeling that you don't have to be confined.  There was a playground which was, of course, my favorite place because I was a real tomboy.  I loved to swing, I would swing higher than the swing could go.
Story_ID: 443751
Speaker 1: My first memory there [Rosenwald Apartments; Michigan Boulevard Apartments, Chicago, Illinois] was of my father [Herman Tate] coming home on my third birthday and knowing that I wanted roller skates.  And you couldn't find roller skates for a child that small, but he must have looked all over the city, and he found a little pair of roller skates that laced over the foot.  And I was thrilled that he found them, but the most important thing, I think, was that he went out with me right away.  He didn't say we have to wait 'til after dinner.  We went outside and put those skates on right then, and skated all--there were lots of sidewalks and things, and he ran around holding my hand.  I learned how to skate that night.  We didn't go in until it was dark because somehow he knew that I needed to do that.
Story_ID: 443752
Speaker 1: Also, there was another area at the other end of the inside [Rosenwald Apartments; Michigan Boulevard Apartments, Chicago, Illinois], see, was-- the building went around, around, sort of a grilled garden area.  People could sit out on bench, and I remember my [paternal] grandmother [Salina Harris Vesey] and my aunts would sit out there, and sort of keep an eye on us while we played out by there was a flag pole.  And I didn't think that was as interesting because there was nothing to swing on or anything up there, but that also was where adults often would sit around and talk.  On the 47th Street side, there was a beauty parlor, and we continued to go to that even after we moved away.  That was a very interesting place, you know, as beauty parlors were during that time.  Everything happened there.  On the outside of the building, there were stores of various kinds.  There was a Walgreens drugstore.  There was eventually a co-op credit union that my father [Herman Tate] helped start with his friends.  We have some wonderful old pictures of them standing there.  And I think at that, that one was an, an all-black one because people--things weren't really integrated then, although he got very much involved shortly after that with the more international co-op movement.  And a lot of his friends who worked with that also lived in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois], and lived in, oh, I think, a couple in South Shore [Chicago, Illinois].  And we all went to a Circle Pine Center co-op camp [Circle Pines Center, Delton, Michigan] in Michigan where there were people from all over the world.  And that was a very important thing to me.  But shall I go back to the Rosenwald?
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: --go back to Rosenwald.
Speaker 1: The Rosenwald--
Speaker 2: And then, we're going to talk about the credit union a little more also.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  The Rosenwald was where I went to nursery school [Rosenwald Nursery School, Chicago, Illinois] with Oneida Cockrell who was--I've met people after that who found out I lived in the Rosenwald; somebody would say, oh, years after that, I went to nursery school there.  And we'd look at each other and say--with Oneida Cockrell?  And it was--I mean, it was, she was a great shaper of children's lives; I think influenced many people that--that early education is so important in developing character, and developing a way of being the kind of standards of behavior, whatever, were very important.  And also, years after we moved away, we still would go down to the Rosenwald and have parties in the social room.  The mothers club mothers, they started out being a child study group.  Many of them were teachers, social workers, people who did things related to those professions.  And even as young teenagers, they would have parties for us.  There was nothing like--oh, just let the kids go run wild.  We did things in our neighborhood, but we also got together.  We had a ball, you know, we would play games.  We would, we just had a lot of fun, and we didn't question whether or not we were being free enough because we were.  Let's see, what else can I tell you about the Rosenwald?
Speaker 2: The, the people who lived there, what type of professions and were most of the family two-parent family--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I think, at least the ones I remember.  Now, there--many people that--we didn't know everybody.  And I do remember the Chapmans, for instance, Caretta Chapman [ph.] and her mother lived there, up on the fifth floor in another part of the building.  And her mother was a widow.  It wasn't--we didn't think that much of whether it was a single-parent family, or a two-parent family, you know, because people had families.  And sometimes, one parent died or whatever, but the important thing was that they were basically family-centered families.  There were a lot of people who lived in the Rosenwald building who didn't have children because I remember pretty much most of the children who were there.  And certainly, it was not a mob scene, but it was a lot of fun.  And many of them, we remained friends with over the years.
Story_ID: 443753
Speaker 1: And you talked about the co-op credit union.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And tell me a little more about how that was formed and, and why it was formed.
Speaker 2: I don't remember a lot about it--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --except that my dad [Herman Tate], you know, he was--the co-op movement was sort of a saving thing in his life, I think, you know, he came from a large family.  He was the only one to go to college.  It, it just worked out in a very interesting way.  He came up from Arkansas and stayed at the home of his oldest sister--I don't know if I told you that before--near the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], and he ended up working his way through the university, but--and getting spectacular grades.  But then, what do you do when you get out, you know, as a black man without the sort of social background that a lot of them had?  And for those days, it was right following the Depression [Great Depression].  It's still in the middle of the Depression, so he worked in the post office, couldn't get a job in his field as a chemist.  But he was very entrepreneurial, and he and his friend started a chemical company.  And eventually, and he had a heart attack and he couldn't keep doing both that and his post office job.  But what made a big difference was his involvement in--he was an idealist and he had friends, a lot of them his post office friends.  I learned a lot of what I learned about life and idealism, democracy, all those things, listening to their conversations at home, and thinking, this world's got to be crazy because there are all these highly educated black men that the world, at this point, pretty much pays no attention to, looks down on, says all the things that they can't do.  And this really is the hope of the future, you know, these are people who understand democracy.  They had a fierce love for their country, a patriotism.  And I kept thinking, you know, the world doesn't know what it has, and what it's missing, but they were being effective in their own way.  And they branched out and found friends of other backgrounds.  And I think it was these guys mostly who started the credit union because it was difficult for black people, of course, to get credit of any kind, and, and to be involved in banking.  I think that it met a real community need at the time.  This was not something that these people were supposed to be able to do.  And so, of course, they did it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then, later, as they became more involved in the larger international co-op movement, it was after that, that the sort of famous co-op store in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois], the Hyde Park Co-op [Hyde Park Cooperative Society, Chicago, Illinois] started with some of these same people, but a much more diverse group.  And there, you have it.  I mean, the co-op movement went--did a lot of things.
Story_ID: 443754
Speaker 1: As a teenager, tell me again, what high school you went to?
Speaker 2: I went to the University of Chicago Lab School [University of Chicago High School; University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Lab School.
Speaker 2: We call it U-High.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And if you would, talk about some of the activities that you might have been involved in.  You said that you were into sports?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.  Well, the thing is that I knew that my father [Herman Tate] wanted a boy, and he had two girls [Cline and her sister, HistoryMaker Amy Tate Billingsley].  He really appreciated his two girls, but I tried very hard to be my father's boy, and I did everything.  Well, from the roller skating when I was little.  And in, in Morgan Park [Chicago, Illinois] at Shoop School [John D. Shoop Elementary School; Shoop Academy of Math, Science, and Technology, Chicago, Illinois], you know, I, I lived for recess, you know, playing on everything, and we had great races.  I played baseball.  I wasn't--I don't think I was included in a way that much in baseball.  I didn't know that much about it until a little later.  We played dodge ball, and we'd play kick ball, and anything like that, I really liked.  And I remember we'd have these races that I'd live for around the little shallow swimming pool area.  And I remember that I could beat Ira Murchison--oh, that's the thing I still remember, who was really short at that time.  And I was real tall, but I could just barely, a couple of times, beat him.  And he later was in the Olympics, so I thought about that--oh, that's interesting.
Speaker 1: Did you ever think about being in organized sports or, you know, Junior Olympics or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No, no, because I don't think I was a joiner that way.  But when I went to U-High, everybody was involved in sports.  It was just part of gym.  I learned how to play field hockey which I loved, and I loved being outdoors.  My dad really got with me about learning certain basics about how to throw and how to bat.  And I was, you know, a fairly, natural athlete so I enjoyed that.  And when I went to the college later at the university [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], I was on the women's varsity basketball team, and something else--hockey.  I played some tennis, but I didn't do tennis much because it--I had to have a stiff wrist.  And I couldn't have a stiff wrist in tennis, and a flexible wrist on the piano.  So, and I bowled.  We could go and set up our own bowling pins.  They had a two-lane bowling alley at the university.  And since I lived about an hour away by streetcar, I often just, I had to stay on campus for a long time, and I would go to Ida Noyes Hall [Chicago, Illinois] and I loved it there.  There'd be all these parlors with books and, and nice comfortable chairs, and you could read, or I could--you could get something to eat in the cafeteria.  I could go downstairs and bowl.  And a friend and I used to set up our own pins and bowl, and I think my best bowling score, bowling every day, was 237.  And that was, you know, that's not bad.  But I also realized that with most things like that, if you do them every day, and you practice at them, people say, oh, isn't that wonderful.  But it's just they can do it, if they did it that way.  And that's been an important thing for me to understand in terms of my attitude later in my professional life.
Story_ID: 443755
Speaker 1: You said you weren't much of a, a joiner.  What about other social things, you know, like debutante balls or (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I was not that kind.  I remember my mother's [Inez Duke Tate] friends--I, I would hear this comment that--sometimes people think children are deaf, dumb, and blind.  And I'd hear this, "Oh, poor little Eileen Tate [HistoryMaker Eileen Cline], all elbows, knees, and glasses." And, you know, it didn't really hurt my feelings that much because that's who I was.  And I think it was one of the reasons I liked to play the piano 'cause I did that, and I did it fairly well, and, and I read a lot, and we had a garden.  We grew all of our own vegetables, and raised chickens all during World War II [WWII].  We were pretty self-supporting.  And, of course, we had to help with that.  And I think because my father's [Herman Tate] large family was around a lot and, and my mother's family wasn't around a lot, but they were in our lives, my grandparents were very influential in my life and in everybody's life--and it didn't occur to me to worry about it.  You just did what you did, and I had fun playing on the playground.  I had friends. But Morgan Park [Chicago, Illinois] was a very different place from the part of Chicago [Illinois] where the people that I used to say, imagine themselves to be W.E.B. Du Bois' Talented Tenth.  You know, they lived pretty much in a different part of town.  And part of my family was considered part of that because my grandfather was in 'Who's Who.'  My grandmother was a principal in, in--somewhere in Indiana, you know, long before that was considered.  They were both highly educated.  My Grandpa Duke [Charles Duke] graduated from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and, you know, had a master's [degree].  He did wonderful things in spite of being--having the kind of blockages that black men did in those days.  He developed the water system in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands [U.S. Virgin Islands], which people will tell you now is the main reason that was able to be developed.  But when it come to the sort of formal social things that you read about in Lawrence Otis Graham's 'Our Kind of People' ['Our Kind of People: Inside America's Black Upper Class'], it was there, but I wasn't part of it.  It wasn't part of my neighborhood.  Some of those people, at least at first, sort of looked down on my mother for marrying a man from the country.  And, yet, he ended up being somebody who was highly regarded and respected by everybody.  Even years later, actually back in the early '90s [1990s], a friend of ours who lives in Santa Barbara, California--background is Swedish, I think, and we all went to Circle Pines camp [Circle Pines Center, Delton, Michigan] together.  And she said that she used to listen, as a teenager, to my father in the meetings that they would have, where they would discuss camp issues, world issues.  And she said, you know, your father was the role model for my entire life and for my profession. She's a--been a very successful person in her profession.  She said, because I would listen to him, and he would quietly listen to everybody.  And then he would say, the one thing that seemed to pull everything together, and settle the disputes without getting into an argument, without, but because he was such a good listener, and he could put it all together.  And it really meant a lot to me that I could see how much he had influenced other people, as well as myself, by being such a kind person, a thoughtful person, and thinking, you know--his whole attitude was, why not, you know, why not expect the best of oneself?  Why not expect the best of everybody else because it is there?
Story_ID: 443756
Speaker 1: Not being a part of that social scene didn't bother you at all?
Speaker 2: Well, I noticed it, but I also--it didn't seem, it didn't seem as substantive, I suppose, in a way to me as what I was trying to learn how to do with my life, which was to, you know, make a difference to a broadened thought to fly.  And I--and so, when there were the debutante balls, for instance--now this actually was pretty much later, you know, as a teenager.  I wasn't going to school that much with a lot of kids who did it, although some did.  My sister [HistoryMaker Amy Tate Billingsley] was a debutante but it, I knew very well that nobody was going to think of me as a debutante, you know, I didn't--I was very tall.  I wore big thick glasses.  I just was not that kind of, of a girl.  I thought of myself as being sort of--I just didn't think of myself as being attractive.  And that was good because then as you get older and you sort of, you know, develop your own personality, you never have an illusion of having to depend on what somebody thinks you look like.  Anyway, it--I don't know how to say that, but I've, have felt blessed at every step, or whatever it was.  And I think that part of my upbringing was such that if something wasn't the way one might think it was, it might want it to be, it didn't matter, because then you figure out something else.  I don't know if I told you before about getting sent to my room to be punished sometimes, not very often.  But I remember that I would, and I'd have to go to my room to think about something.  And my sister and I shared a room, you know, it was a small house, but it was up on the second floor.  Our bedroom was on one side of the little hallway, and the bathroom in between, and our parents' [Inez Duke Tate and Herman Tate] bedroom.  And I'd go up to my room and it was, it had a nice sunny exposure.  There was a little window there, and I had a rocking chair.  So, I'd go up and I'd sit in my rocking chair, and I'd read and I'd sing, and there wasn't any reason to be unhappy.  And my parents told me at one point--I think my mother told me this that she would say to my dad, she'd say, "Herman, you're not punishing her at all, you know, because I would sound so happy."  And he'd say, "That's all right, you don't want to break her spirit." I think that was an important thing.  Also important was my paternal grandmother [Salina Harris Vesey] who lived with us, and only went to fourth grade, was a wonderful, strong woman, raised ten kids.  And I remember her the night after listening to several of them having a wonderful time talking about all the things that they had survived and everything.  And some of them were--you know, it was not an easy life.  And the next morning, I was sitting in a room while she was quilting, and I was backing her letters.  I was nine, I remember, because I was in fourth grade, and she had only gone to fourth grade, and she didn't trust herself.  She wrote her own letters, but she didn't trust herself to back them, to put the addresses on because she didn't know whether it would be legible enough, so I would back her letters for her.  So, I'd sit and I'd back her letters while she quilted.  And I remember her rocking and saying, "You know, I have lived a good life."  And I'm thinking, yeah, but last night; I'm thinking about all the hardships and all the difficulties, and the things that they lived through.  Of course, they joked about it, but it was, you know, lameness, deafness, deaths, and so on.  And she said because I have, because I have my health, and I am able to do.  That, again, has been a mantra for my whole life that as long as one can do, to be able to do, is the most precious thing.
Story_ID: 443757
Speaker 1: There were a couple of teachers who were very inspiring or encouraging to you.  Tell me who they were. I'm talking, and at Shoop [John D. Shoop Elementary School; Shoop Academy of Math, Science, and Technology, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: At Shoop School.  Well, it's always hard to--two that stand out, particularly right now, were my math-music teacher in seventh grade, I think it was, who was Mr. Stewart, Kenneth Stewart, who also subbed as a trombone player in--I think it was Earl Hines' [Earl "Fatha" Hines] band.  And we learned all kinds of great songs from him.  And he told us a wonderful story about being in Washington Park [Chicago, Illinois] early one morning, and a guy who was down and out coming by.  He's sitting on a bench and this guy asking him, saying, you know, could you spare a dime, not for a cup of coffee which was, and he said, but could you take me for a cup of coffee or something like that.  And he said, it struck him because he didn't ask him for money.  He asked him for a cup of coffee, and they went and visit--well, it was Nat King Cole.  And that was one of the most interesting things, so he used to tell wonderful stories like that.  And he helped us have a wonderful sense of, of history and of character and the things that had built much of this country, which, of course, I have to say now, since this is three days after Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] has been elected president, that this was the underpinning.  I mean, these were the ideals, the character development.  I think it's significant how much of the time he spent in Hyde Park in Chicago [Illinois].  I mean, there was a, a real depth of idealism, and a depth of character, and a depth of strength, and I feel really fortunate that our family was part of that.  The other person who made such a big difference, oh, let me--I remember things, like singing 'The Old Lamplighter,' and so on.  The other one in eighth grade was Ms. Laffoon [HistoryMaker Barbara A. Sizemore].  And I remember us getting all excited about Ms. Laffoon because she was the youngest teacher we'd ever had.  I think she was twenty at the time.  She had graduated from Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] at age nineteen, and it turned out and then a little while later, she got married, and she'd married a Mr. Sizemore [Furman Sizemore].  So, she was Barbara Laffoon Sizemore who started--went on to make history, both in Chicago and Washington, D.C., as superintendent of schools, was a wonderful influence, and very, very warm and, and demanding of us in terms of our intelligence.  And she was a such good example of it, but she, you know, brook no nonsense.  The other eighth grade teacher, though, who was--I don't remember whether it was one semester of one or the other, was a Mrs. Cunningham [ph.], who was an older woman, who also had just an elegant sense of standards and expectations of us, and that makes a huge difference for children.  At one point on our report cards, though, I remember one of them, I got a check in--I used to get checks in self-control, and--because I liked to talk. But that was, you know, something that I just worked on.  But then, I got a check on initiative once.  And my parents [Inez Duke Tate and Herman Tate] would go over the report card at home, and I remember asking my father, what does, what does initiative mean?  And he started laughing and he said, "Go get the dictionary."

Speaker 1: Talk a little bit about your, the arts--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and your involvement in music and dance.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, that also started in the Rosenwald building [Rosenwald Apartments; Michigan Boulevard Apartments, Chicago, Illinois], partly because we had an old upright piano.  My mother [Inez Duke Tate] had taken piano lessons.  I think in almost every middle-class home in the United States--I found out later when I did a study on piano competitions--that it didn't matter what ethnic background, everybody had pianos.  I mean, any old piece of thing--there were pianos in people's houses.  And I found that in Morgan Park [Chicago, Illinois], too.  So, we had a piano and I loved it, and I loved hearing my mother sing to us at night when we went to sleep, so I just--and then in our kindergarten, we had rest period.  And they would sing and, and play these lovely little lullaby things, like 'The Skye Boat Song,' you know, that also was historically interesting.  So, I just, I loved the quiet time and the music, and listening it to a lot.  And maybe because I did, particularly, there was a lady named--it wasn't Mrs. Campbell [ph.]--I can't remember her name--who lived in the Rosenwald building who taught piano.  And so, when I was three, they took me over to her.  And I just had a lovely time with little books with pictures, and I learned a little bit.  And then we, when we moved from the Rosenwald building when I was almost seven, then I didn't take lessons again for a while.  And in our school, at Shoop School [John D. Shoop Elementary School; Shoop Academy of Math, Science, and Technology, Chicago, Illinois], they had group lessons that you could take lessons in class and I did that, and it was just fun.  And then, the lady, Mrs. Carter [ph.], also taught in her home on Saturdays, and so I started going to do that.  And I don't remember a whole lot about it, except that I remember the songs we played.  We did the--it was a Helen Curtis 'Fundamental Piano Series' ['Fundamental Piano Series for Class and Individual Instruction'], which I think was very well done.  I have not found a better foundational one since then.  And, eventually, I think when I was about eleven or so, they decided that I should go downtown to the Chicago Musical College [Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois] to--the Helen Curtis people had about five teachers down there who taught children who were a little more advanced, I guess.  And I had individual lessons then.  But every time we played on a recital, it was with at least two of us, and often the lessons included two people.  And I just loved it.  My teacher was Geneva Robinson, who lived in Oak Park [Illinois].  And I remember thinking she looked like, a little Beethoven [Ludwig van Beethoven].  You know, she was, she was short, and her hair, kind of white hair, sort of stood out; one of the kindest, most focused people.  And she was very demanding and, and I remember thinking sometimes she'd have me do something for the umpteenth time to really get it just right.  And I realized later, had I not been raised to be a respectful child--I mean, there were so many times I was--would you stop and just let go and--never.  I mean, kids nowadays might do that, but I wouldn't have thought of it.  And having somebody like that sort of help you through the difficulty of having to stay with something was very important.  And I think it's something often that children these days miss because adults don't always want to do what it takes to stick with a child, and insist that they do something right, and do it in a way that they understand that this is for them, and not against them.
Story_ID: 443759
Speaker 1: The going downtown for my piano lessons--I think, at this point, I had started at the Lab School [University of Chicago High School; University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois].  And I was eleven, twelve, starting to be twelve, and so, besides the hour that it took to get to school on the street car, then I had to take the train, another half hour at least downtown, which I did.  And then, I'd take a train from downtown home out to Morgan Park [Chicago, Illinois], which was another good hour, and often, I'd have long lessons and stay late.  And Mr. Robinson would come to pick up Mrs. Robinson [Cline's piano teacher, Geneva Robinson] because he wouldn't have her go home by herself to Oak Park [Illinois].  And they would walk with me to the train station, so they would take me to the train station after my lessons.  And they were just such kind people and it, it's interesting how normal it seemed.  I would sometimes have to stay down and wait for my lesson, and I'd go to Walgreens drugstore down there right under the elevated [train], and buy hot fudge sundaes.  I really liked food a lot--I still do.  And I remember that the scoops of ice cream were cubes, you know, they, they, the scoops were like squares, and so we'd get cubes of ice cream, and I can still taste that.
Story_ID: 443760
Speaker 1: I'd go over to the next block to the Lyon and Healy music store [Chicago, Illinois], and browse around and find interesting pieces of music that I used to do all sort--my Aunt Alma's [ph.] house, one of my father's [Herman Tate] sisters, was the widow of--oh, why am I blocking--Alma Irwin--of Cecil Irwin who was the arranger with Earl Hines' [Earl "Fatha" Hines] band in the '30s [1930s].  I never knew him because the band had a bus accident the year I was born.  He was the only one who was killed.  But I would go over to her house and they had a, a grand piano in, in their house.  It was, you know, musicians did then, and she had tons and tons of music.  And when I'd go over, and I almost just spend time there, I'd go in that little room, and I would spend hours just digging through, and playing a lot of the old, wonderful old pop tunes.  I don't think that there is anything that was written in the '30s [1930s] and the '40s [1940s] that I don't know.  And I mean, I can tell it after two notes, so I really liked that.  That was a very important influence.  Also, my dad, he may have been a country boy, but he loved classical music, and we had records at home.  I remember 'The Beautiful Blue Danube,' 'Tales from the Vienna Woods' [Johann Strauss II].  He had an album of love songs sung by Rise Stevens.  We had Paul Robeson's 'Ballad for Americans.'  It was all wonderful.  We had Arthur Rubinstein.  We had Horwitz [Vladimir Horowitz], so I heard a lot of that.  It was a very eclectic musical background, and I heard a lot of that, but I also heard a lot of the popular music.  We were all involved in that.  At Circle Pines co-op camp [Circle Pines Center, Delton, Michigan], we sang folk songs all the time, and from all around the world.  And we sang at meals, we always sang at meals toward the end of the meals.  And I'm now having a good time teaching my grandchildren some of those great songs from places.
Story_ID: 443761
Speaker 1: Tell me where Circle Pines [Circle Pines Center, Delton, Michigan]; where, where was the camp?
Speaker 2: It was near Kalamazoo, Michigan, and it was called Circle Pines because it was originally a Quaker camp that was called Camp Chief Noonday.  And when the co-op movement took it over, they planted a circle of pines around all of the acreage.  And every year, they would plant a new circle of pines, and they would harvest those as Christmas trees.  That was one of the ways they, they supported that endeavor.  That was really wonderful.  Everybody got on a job team when you got there.  By the time you were ten or eleven, you were on teams with adults or whatever.  And there were meal set-ups, dishwashing, cleaning-up, duty X which was cleaning the, the bathrooms, a duty Y which was cleaning around the, the farm yard.  And one of the neat things I remember was that whenever your family would arrive, the, the first meal, everybody would sing a Danish welcome song, and they'd sing, 'Hun Skal Leve' (singing).  And it was just great, you know.  People would be greeted by that and then when--if you were going to leave before the next meal, everybody would sing a similar goodbye song.  So, it was just full of music, and we also square-danced every night.  And, you know, when children are seeing teenagers and young adults having such a great time, and they include them in it, it's, it was a very inspirational thing.  And it became such an important part of my life and, and my inspiration.  And I suppose you might say that was a lot of the influence that made me not miss the normal sort of socializing kinds of, of things.  That was, that seemed sort of small in comparison with the inspiration, and the sense of imagination that I was getting from a much larger world.
Story_ID: 443762
Speaker 1: I took ballet lessons.  It was a studio that was sort of like a, a playground community hall across Wabash [Avenue] from the, from the Rosenwald [Rosenwald Apartments; Michigan Boulevard Apartments, Chicago, Illinois].  And a Swedish ballet teacher, Mildred Hessler [ph.], taught there.  And all the, you know, little kids, black kids from our neighborhood and wherever, all took ballet.  We had a wonderful time.  She was really good.  And I still remember Zephyr Harrison [ph.], was later her name, but she used to play the piano.  She's a great pianist.  And, again, it was the musical part of putting that with the dance.  My idols then were Frances Taylor [Frances Taylor Davis], who lived also in the Rosenwald building, was a beautiful dancer, later married Miles Davis.  Louise Stubbs, who went to New York [New York], and danced in the production of 'The Blacks' [sic. 'Black Girl,' J.E. Franklin].  There were just--and other people I can't quite remember right now, but it was a beautiful dance training.  And I stayed with it 'til I was maybe a little over twelve.  And I danced in 'The Nutcracker' [Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky] at the Eighth Street Theater [Chicago, Illinois] and things.  I was a pretty good dancer, but I couldn't keep up all of that when I had to decide on something.  I remember thinking that, again, I was not the kind of attractive that I could imagine being a ballet dancer.  At that time, there were no black ballet dancers.  That was before Alvin Ailey.  Frances, and Louise, and some of those (unclear) were the first one to really get into professional ballet.  But I was a little younger than they, and that hadn't happened yet.  And somehow, I couldn't, I couldn't see myself, as much as I loved to dance, so that later the square dancing and then, in the late '50s [1950s], I really got to be a folk dance nut.  And when I was teaching in Gary, Indiana [at the Lincoln School], I got my Gary, Indiana kids--got to be folk dance fiends, too, because it was a wonderful insight into the culture and lives of people all around the world.  And you could understand the commonalities of their hopes, their feelings, their energies; all the things that I think make us one people in the world.  So, I was very conscious of that.
Story_ID: 443763
Speaker 1: So now, when you're ready to go to college and, and I know you wanted to move away from home?
Speaker 2: Oh, wait, one more thing, one more thing.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: This was at U-High [University of Chicago High School; University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, Chicago, Illinois], the other thing at U-High, that was a huge difference, was that we were supposed to be smart kids.  I'm think-, it really was that we just weren't dumb kids, you know, and we were kids who, whose families valued education.  And so, learning was an exciting thing.  And by the end of tenth grade, we could all apply to college, to the college [University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  And only one person in my tenth grade class didn't pass the college entrance exam.  We took the same thing everybody else did from around the world.  But it didn't mean that the education was, was narrow, or--it was just well-directed because in addition to our academics--and, again, one of my best teachers there was when Langston Hughes came to teach for a while when I was in tenth grade.  And it was wonderful hearing him, you know, do--he would read from the 'Rime of the Ancient Mariner' ['The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,' Samuel Taylor Coleridge].  And we would just be fascinated the whole time.  He had a wonderful voice of--we'd hear: "Water, water everywhere," and he read that, the whole thing over a period of days.  But also, we had, besides lots of sports, we really did sports seriously, which meant every day for fun and, and did them well.  But we also had home ec [home economics], which the boys also had to take.  We had shop, which the girls also took, so I learned to do metal laving, and all kinds of things that I wouldn't have learned otherwise.  We had art.  We had music, and music, we had a man named Mr. Vail [ph.] who was the most wonderful music appreciation teacher there has ever been.  And years later, when I was doing a master's degree at the University of Colorado [Boulder, Colorado], my teacher was Storm Bull--interesting name--who it turned out, had also gone to the lab school half a generation before me.  And his music teacher had been Mr. Vail.  And later, when I was dean at Peabody [Peabody Conservatory of Music; Peabody Institute, Baltimore, Maryland], one of our graduate students--we were chatting one day and talking about something--he had gone to the lab school many years later, had also had Mr. Vail.  His influence on generations was just remarkable.  We all fell in love with symphony music, chamber music.  We spent our whole times in his classes listening.  He'd make up funny stories sometimes to help us remember themes of things and, and we had to memorize themes, but it was great fun.  But that was a huge cornerstone of my musical education.  He also, on Tuesday nights, had a choral group, and it was called Jimmy Chantes [ph.].  It was called Jimmy Chantes because he took it from the French J'aime chant, which means, I love to sing, and we called it Jimmy Chantes.  And it was just a wonderful group.  It was well done.  We sang great songs.  But it was--and the camaraderie of doing it, because I lived so far.  And it was in the evening, so I stayed down in town on Tuesday nights.  I don't even remember now how I got home.  I probably just took the streetcar home at night which was not a scary thing to do in those days.  You just were careful.  But for dinner, I always had dinner at the home of friends in school, and they turned out to be one of the--one of my friends who lived near the university, and I often had dinner with them, was the daughter of Harold Urey, you know, the famous scientist.  We'd have parties at Enrico Fermi's house.  Another--the people I stayed with the most were the Elsons [ph.], who I still remember. They lived at 5742 Dorchester [Avenue].  And their daughter and I remained friends for all of our lives until she died just a few years ago.  Her cousin is still a close friend of ours.  You know, there were just friendships that developed because we had a common sense of, of humanitarian values--I think I would say.  So that was a very important part also of my musical experience.  It happened there.
Story_ID: 443764
Speaker 1: So that when I was going to go to, quote, real college, you know, I wanted to--when I was seventeen, I had, had two years at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  And I had completed eight, I think, eight or nine of the fourteen comprehensive exams that constituted a liberal arts degree.  So I had, you know, the majority of a liberal arts degree.  And I wanted to go to college, you know, real college, as I thought of it then.  And I was oriented toward music because I really liked sports, but I couldn't see spending my life as an adult doing sports. And I loved dance, and I couldn't imagine doing that.  But I also loved music and I loved playing the piano.  I didn't know what I would do.  I didn't think of anything of being a concert artist or anything like that.  I just wanted to follow what I loved to do.  And so, I centered--helped very much by Mrs. Robinson's [Cline's piano teacher, Geneva Robinson] guidance on going to Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] or to Oberlin [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio].  And both good schools. I decide--I chose Oberlin for several reasons.  One, it was farther away from home and I, as close as I was to my family, I think I was, I wanted to be sure that I was building my life, that I really knew what I believed in, and that I was making my own decisions.  And I knew that if I could go home too often, we would have our usual discussions.  And, and I probably thought I would be more influenced, and wouldn't know for sure whether what I was doing was because of what I believe now.  It came out that, that happened more than I thought it might have because my dad [Herman Tate] died right before I went to college.  So, I really had to draw on a lot of that.  But the other thing about Oberlin that attracted me was that they didn't have any sororities and fraternities.  And I already was very aware that in the larger world, they were very racist organizations.  I mean, they just were simply not the least bit integrated.  They left people out which, to me, meant that they didn't know any better.  See, I always, from the time I was a kid, I felt sorry for people who didn't know my father 'cause I thought they just don't know any better.  And I, I never did feel like a second-class citizen in that way.  And they had admitted women since, since the mid-18-, 19th century, 18th century.
Speaker 2: Eighteenth century.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 443765
Speaker 1: I liked, I loved everything about the idealism of Oberlin [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio].  And in the '50s [1950s], the early '50s [1950s] when I went there, I found it to be exactly that.  I mean, it was a place of great freedom for me.  It was pretty strait-laced in some ways.  We had housemothers.  I had a housemother, who was the widow of Colonel Park [ph.] from Virginia.  And everybody was scared to sit at her table, which you had to do regularly, because of table manners or whatever.  I had no qualms because my Aunt Rebecca [ph.], who was my maiden library aunt, was sort of the, the table manners police.  And so, I would--by the time I got to Oberlin, I was comfortable with many things.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  But talk to me more about the classes that you took at Oberlin, and why you took them, and how your music progressed there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I went to the conservatory [Oberlin Conservatory of Music, Oberlin, Ohio].  There was the conservatory and the college.  And I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life after college.  I was busy just enjoying life as it went along.  And I remember thinking my freshman year, and trying to, to chart what to think about, and realizing once--I still remember where I was walking--that if you're not willing to walk down to the corner--you have to walk down to the corner in order to see what's around it.  So, I pretty much decided I would just do the best I could, and enjoy what I could while I was there.  And I knew that I didn't want to teach.  That's the one thing--I didn't want to teach because my mother [Inez Duke Tate] was a teacher.  And you want to do something that you're, you know, beyond, what your mother did.  So, I did not, but then, I decided, well, I might as well take a double major.  I was a piano major, and then I, I took a major in music education also, because I could do that, because the requirements, the academic requirements, most of them, I had already satisfied at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  So, I was able, with only a couple of correspondence courses, to do two degrees in that four years.  So, that kind of made sense just to have to do.  And I, you know, enjoyed my piano lessons.  I was pretty good but, you know, nothing spectacular.  And I, I didn't have the personality to want to just go out on the stage and do that, although later, I loved doing that as a folk dancer.  But the most important things to me in the conservatory were my rhythmics class, which was learning to move to music.  It, it, to me, it, it, it helped put together what I already felt about movement and dance.  And it was a wonderful insight into how music works, which also I was able to use in all of the rest of my life, as a performer, as a teacher in understanding music, and how it relates to the insides of people.  The other thing was that I was fortunate enough to be in the Oberlin College choir with Robert Fountain which was my life then.  I mean, we--the demands of it, the, the emotional, and the skill demands were intense.  I mean, it had to be and, and it was a very communal thing.  It was very clear to all of us as, as Fountain approached it, that you were part of a group in which everybody was important.  You couldn't even get in it unless your voice blended with other people's voices.  There were voice majors, who couldn't get into the choir, because their voices stood out too much.  It required listening carefully, and it required learning a lot about how the line goes.  It required going beyond what you thought you could do in terms of your endurance.  I remember singing things like some Brahms [Johannes Brahms] motets, things about Job's devout patience, you know, the kinds of things that you learn that, that had to do with living life.  And that was an important musical, and spiritual, and motivational experience.  It was probably the most important musical experience of those times.
Story_ID: 443766
Speaker 1: At the end of my sophomore year--you know, my dad [Herman Tate] was dead, we didn't have money and, and I had to find a job.  The--after my freshman year, I was--what do we call-I--sort of behind the scenes clerk in a department store in, up in Roseland [Chicago, Illinois], near us (unclear).  I was more highly educated than the people who owned the store, the sales people, or anything.  But, you know, I was the little black lady who was in the back, you know, repairing things, getting lipstick off of stuff.  And, again, I didn't, you know, it's--didn't matter to me.  It was a job.  I could do it well.  I learned a whole lot that was useful to me then. But there was always enough else in my life that I never felt trampled down.  You know, I just figure people are who they are.  They do what they do.  This is the way history is at this time and I'm fine.  So, the second year, I really didn't want to do that anymore.  And I didn't know what I would do for the summer.  And my roommate at Oberlin [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio] said to me at one point, said, have you ever been a camp counselor?  And I said no.  She said, well, my mother runs this camp in Michigan, and we're looking for a music counselor, and it pays yea much.  And I said, whoop dee do, so I'll do that.  So, I went off to Riseman Farm Camp [Michigan]; had the hardest experience of my life. You know, having to be up in front of people which I was not--you know, I thought of myself as being a shy person.  I had to get up in front of the whole camp and lead campfire songs, and stuff like that.  So, I had to figure out how to do that and survive, and what things to do that would keep everybody involved.  And I also had to teach classes for the kids, so I had to figure how to do things.  I loved it in the long run.  And my, my roommate and I shared--we were co-counselors in a cabin of little girls in range from six to ten, I think.  So, we were learning to be parents in a way.  It was just a spectacular experience.  We had a lot of fun with the other counselors.  We'd go out on counselors' night off, and do crazy things and have a lot of fun.
Speaker 2: Was this an integrated camp?
Speaker 1: I was the only black person there.  There was an Indian woman there.  It was mainly a Jewish camp.  And I remember noticing that the kids who had the best rhythm, and caught up on the best things, were people who had black nannies at home. You know so, they heard a lot, a lot of this music, whereas in my experience, I had relatives and friends who had no sense of rhythm because they had none of that in their background.  They were some of the ones who were busy being the elite, so they didn't have this richness of musical experience.  I found that fascinating, and I noticed it then.  But, again, it was, it was just something interesting to do.  And the kids were interesting, and the counselors were interesting, and we just had a good time.  And, again, some of them became friends that I've known all of my life.
Story_ID: 443767
Speaker 1: That was the summer that I fell in love with teaching because I realized that the only thing that would get me through that first summer--I did it [camp counselor at Riseman Farm Camp, Michigan] for two summers--was to love it.  I had learned that, and they taught that at home about a lot of things.  You don't love something--it's going to be miserable, so why be miserable?  And I had a couple of children who really had some serious emotional and behavioral issues, but we had to deal with them.  And I found that I could, I could do it with music.  I could do it with loving them with music.  And I began to realize what a difference it was making to these children's lives, and that's when I fell in love with teaching, and decided that when I graduated [from Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio], I did, indeed, want to teach.  And I couldn't get a teaching job.  This, this was 1956 and, you know, who are you going--what, what were people going to do with a, a black Pi Kappa Lambda female, you know.  What was I going to go do?  Well, I thought, well, I'll get a teaching job.  I applied all over the country, and really didn't even get any answers.  And the last moment, and I think I already said in the other one, something about my airplane flight and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and man inventing the wheel.  But that teaching job in Gary, Indiana [at Lincoln School] was more fun.  It was so hard because I had to learn as I was going along.  I was what-twenty-one, when I started it.  It was a humongous load, but I taught them what I enjoyed.  And that was the whole point, was at that point, you know, how twenty-one-year-olds are, you know, you've got all these hormones going and everything anyway.  And I had such a sense of passion about what I had learned, particularly in the Oberlin College choir, and these experiences.  And I couldn't--I wanted to give them back, but I couldn't, you know.  I mean, I couldn't, I couldn't give it back to Bob Fountain [Robert Fountain].  I couldn't go back to any of that, but I could give it to these kids.  And so, that was a lot, that whole thing became a lot of motivation for the rest of my life, that I could share with other people what had meant so much to me.  And that motivated my teaching there and everything after that.
Story_ID: 443768
Speaker 1: --Lived in Gary [Indiana] during the week.  I went home on weekends and, you know, had my usual things that I did in Chicago [Illinois] with friends.  The second year, I lived at home and commuted.  And one of the things that I did, and I don't remember whether it was both years, or when I started.  But I took piano lessons also down at Roosevelt College [Chicago Musical College; Roosevelt University, Chicago, Illinois] with Rudolph Ganz, who was a very famous, wonderful pianist.  And he, at the time, was eighty-five years old.  And Mrs. Robinson [Cline's piano teacher, Geneva Robinson] had suggested, recommended to him that I study with him.  And I remember that he charged ninety dollars an hour, which was a huge amount of money then, if he would take you.  But he did take me as a student, and he told me that he would give me a scholarship of forty-five dollars for a half hour.  Well, that I could manage and then, he would give me two-hour lessons.  It was wonderful.  I had a wonderful time studying with him.  And it was, again, a, a meeting of the musical minds.  You know, he--I told him that I wanted to learn more about technique.  And he said, that's--you don't need technique.  He said, your technique is good enough.  You have a wonderful musical understanding, which was great for me.  So, we would talk about music and, and he would play things for me.  And we'd look at it what it was about.  And I'd go home and practice it, and it seemed easy.  It was much later that I started trying to think about things in a more mechanical way.  And it seemed harder, but playing the piano was easy with him.  And that was a very, again, helpful thing to me as I became more of a teacher, and an administrator, because it was part of something that I understood that I could, again, share with people and, and help guide them in ways that were less restrictive than they might have thought they had to adhere to.

Speaker 1: Another thing that I did then--I guess my main activities, I was in the Chicago Symphony Orchestra chorus.  It was started by Margaret Hillis then. And I was just dying for another choral experience.  I wanted another Bob Fountain [Robert Fountain] choral experience.  I wanted to go sing with Robert Shaw.  And there was a point when I had to decide whether to get married, or join the Robert Shaw Chorale.  I decided to get married [to William Cline].  But it's interesting to meet and talk with Robert Shaw later, you know, on a professional level, and to really appreciate him so much in that way.  But, meanwhile, I auditioned for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra chorus, and I was excited about that.  Turned out, I think I was the only non-professional singer who was accepted into it at--just because I had a choral background.  And then I had, you know, a pretty good voice, and I could read music.  And I really enjoyed it.  It was a very different choral experience because we were singing with a lot of people who really thought of themselves as great singers.  So, to sing the Verdi [Giuseppe Verdi] 'Requiem' with people like that, and in the Oberlin College choir [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio], we were trained to listen carefully to the people around us, and listen to the blend--well, in this one, everybody was just singing out there.  And it was a different thing, but it was a very, a very special experience.  I enjoyed that.  We sang down at Orchestra Hall [Symphony Center, Chicago, Illinois].  And then, the other activity that I did a lot of then was folk dancing because some of the people that I had known at Circle Pines [Circle Pines Center, Delton, Michigan], we square-danced.  I had sort of started a lot of the folk dance stuff that started going. At the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], they met a lot and so, I was back in town around then.  This was 1956 to '58 [1958] and so, I did a lot of that.  And I would say that my experiences, my extracurricular and my other experiences, were pretty musical most of that time 'cause that's what I loved to do--
Story_ID: 443770
Speaker 1: Oh, we had started also, square dancing at Ada Park in Chicago [Illinois]; on the South Side in Morgan Park [Chicago, Illinois], there was a community center.  And Walter Roberts [ph.]--I don't know how I could possibly not mention him--who, again, mentored so many young people in Morgan Park.  I mean, he just made a big difference in many people's lives.  He was at the, the recreational center there.  And we did a lot of square dancing of all things out there.  And I remember the guys--he had them all where they wore these blue satin shirts, and handkerchiefs out of their pockets.  And I, you know, we'd wear flared skirts and things, and that was a lot of fun.  So, I had that piece of, again, this sort of folk-ish, square dance background, so I did that a lot.
Story_ID: 443771
Speaker 1: And that pretty much was my life in Chicago [Illinois].  And I always knew that I would not live there all of my life.  I always dreamed of mountains and things like that, just being out, being able to fly.  And my dad [Herman Tate] used to say, why not?  And I think my mother [Inez Duke Tate] said there were other friends of theirs, friends of hers, who just couldn't understand this weird child who thought that she would be doing something other than whatever everybody did; which is why I thought later, as I thought of something like The HistoryMakers that, you know, in a way, history is--we make history by not being confined to history, because if I had paid too much attention to history, history was saying that as a female, as a black child, as coming from a poor family, but an educationally rich family, whatever, there were certain things that I should have been confined to do.  But I didn't know that--nobody told me.  I mean, my dad was one of these great people about, if not, you know, why not?
Speaker 2: Why not.
Speaker 1: And so, it didn't occur to me that anything was not possible; that was important to every single turn of my life.
Story_ID: 443772
Speaker 1: Did you get married before you went to grad school?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I got married to a fellow [William Cline] that I had met at Oberlin [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio] and had dated there, and he had gone to the [U.S.] Army.  He was a linguist and get--came from a family that did not even have the education quite that mine did, although they had at least all gone to high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother [Inez Duke Tate] went to college.  My father [Herman Tate] went to college, but on my mother's--on my father's side of the family, he was the only one who did.  My husband was a real genius.  You know, he was one of these kids, he was from Mansfield, Ohio, and he had an incredible memory, incredible musical talent, which I think his mom had, digital dexterity, like you can't believe.  The thing that was different was that he did not have the--you know, I happened to have had a particular kind of focused upbringing that was just not available to him in Mansfield, Ohio.  But he was so smart that he got a four-year scholarship to Oberlin 'cause he had straight A's and, you know, he just got this.  He said he found it difficult when he got there because he had never really had to learn how to study.  You know, there were things like calculus, for instance.  He'd come up--he'd go to bed, and come up with the answer to a problem when he woke up in the morning.  But the point was, they wanted him to figure out he got to it, and he didn't always know how he got to it, so he had to learn that.  But we got married in February of my second year of teaching.  And he was not able to find--he'd just gotten out of the Army, he couldn't find a job in his field.  But he did, interestingly enough, get a job.  He took some tests at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], and he was talented in many fields.  And so they--he got a job as a, as a technician, a hematologist, at the La Rabida heart sanatorium [La Rabida Children's Hospital, Chicago, Illinois], which was not anything like his (unclear)--but he had a good time doing that because again, he, whatever he did, he did well, he had fun with.  And then by a total fluke, somebody who he had met, opened up something.  We ended up going to--moving to Colorado to go to grad school [University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado].
Story_ID: 443773
Speaker 1: Now, talk to me about--now you talked before about, about grad school, but the children's choir.
Speaker 2: Oh.  Well, at one point, when my children [Jonathan Cline and Joy Cline Phinney] were in fourth and fifth grade, here [Colorado] again, I had this wonderful Bob Fountain [Robert Fountain] Oberlin College choir [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio] experience that I kept trying to replicate anyway, somewhere.  And there was nothing like that for my children out in Boulder [Colorado].  So, I decided, with a friend, to start the Boulder Children's Choir.  So we took fourth, fifth, and sixth graders, I started a children's choir.  I had no more--I no more knew what I was doing, but I think in almost everything that I've ever done, when I start it, I really didn't know what I was doing, but I was willing to try.  It's, it's so often the question of seeing a need, trying to pull from your own experience what, how you could meet that need, and then just go for it.  So, that's what I did with the children's choir.  And I also was teaching a lot of piano then.  I was an independent piano studio teacher, and I taught some at the university [University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado].  I ran a program for non-music majors there.  The whole thing was just a lot of fun to me because it was things that I could see something that needed doing.  And there had to had been some reason for the things that I had learned in my life and to put them into action there.  So, that's what I did.
Story_ID: 443774
Speaker 1: So now, you're in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm in--
Speaker 1: Colorado.
Speaker 2: Yep, and I'm folk dancing, and I'm climbing mountains.
Speaker 1: Tell me about your first climbing experience.
Speaker 2: My first climbing--well, it--the idea of mountain climbing always intrigued me, but scared me to death, too.  And I remember when we first went out there.  We'd drive up Boulder Canyon, which people have seen in the 'Mork and Mindy' shows. And we'd look up, way up on, on, on a mountain, on the side of a rock.  And we'd see these people up there climbing.  We think, those fools up there, so that's how we thought.  And, you know, we, you knew every--there--everybody knew people who had friends or kids who had died climbing, or in the mountains.  And the mountains are unforgiving, but it's sort of part of life out here.  And probably not more dangerous than what happens in cities, you know, with people driving too fast, and stuff like that.  The mountains are just a different kind of challenge.  And, but when our son [Jonathan Cline] was eleven, he came home one day, and he said, "Mom, is it safer to climb in hiking boots or sneakers?"  And I started shaking.  I said, "Where have you been?"  And he'd been down climbing on a rock wall down at the university [University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado] at the Varsity Pond.  And I said, you don't climb in anything until you take the Colorado Mountaineering School thing.  I said, you got to learn how--if you're going to do it, learn how to do it right.  I was scared, and I decided because one of my best friends at that time, who was also a folk dance partner, was head of the mountain, the Colorado Mountain Club, and I really trusted him.  So, I decided, I'll take the Colorado Mountain Club thing this year, so I did.  And it was so much fun, you know, learning how to tie knots, getting on belay on ropes, you know, having to rappel yourself off of a cliff.  And when there are other people doing it; and you've done a certain amount of theoretical study, you had to take an exam, a book exam, before you could even do friction climbing.  Friction climbing is, is, say, if there's a slant, rock that's a slant, and you learn how to walk on it in the right way.  That's called friction climbing, so I did that.  I took that course to see, to be sure that I felt that it was safe for my son to do it.  And I got kind of hooked on it.  And one of our first climbs was up in Boulder Canyon.  So, we'd take these heavy backpacks and, and walk across a pipeline, across a stream, which was the hardest part to me.  That was the scariest thing, but everybody else was doing it, so you do it.  So, we start climbing, and climbed across a--some place there'd be a crack that you know you couldn't put your foot in, except that we knew we could.  And we were on belay ropes, which meant that there was somebody up ahead of us who had a strap to them.  So, if we fell, we really wouldn't fall very far.  So, I got almost up to the top of where we were climbing this particular time.  And there's a place called Cozyhang, and it's a rock that juts out.  And you, to get to it, you have to jump up, and jam your hand in a crack, so that it holds you, and then pull yourself up, and toss your leg over this rock.  So, other people before me did it, so I, you know, get it, so I jumped up.  And, and when you get your hand in this crack, you're kind of off the ground, so you have to get your hand in the crack, throw your leg at the same time.  Well, I did it, and I fell off 'cause I just couldn't quite make it.  And, of course, when you fall of, you're on belay.  So, I'm kind of bouncing against the side of the wall, and they let me down slowly.  And so, I tried it again, and this time, I made it.  And so, I'm lying up here, having gotten on to this ledge, and I'm lying there.  And I look down to the floor of the canyon which was way far away.  And I had this flashback about, here I was one of these crazy fools, and was up on top of the mountain.  And that was kind of--I, I, climbed a lot that season.  And at one point, though, I finally decided that it took too much time, you know.  I sat in one belay spot, helping some other people, who were having trouble making their ropes work once for two hours.  And I thought, gee, in two hours, I could have done this.  I could have learned this much music.  And I had accomplished my purpose, which was to be sure that it was safe for my son to do the mountaineering school, which he did.  There were, you know--but I still did a little bit from time to time.  And I did a lot of skiing, downhill skiing, and cross-country skiing, which was another wonderful exercise in camaraderie, and a, a sense of survival, the kinds of things that you have to think about and do and survive.
Story_ID: 443775
Speaker 1: Now, talk to me a little bit about the Y [Young Women's Christian Association (YMCA)] board revelation.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Shortly after we moved to Colorado to go to graduate school [University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado], one of the people we met--a woman appeared on our porch with some flowers and left a note--we weren't there--and said who she was.  She was, she had met, she had met a woman, who also worked with the Y, who was somebody who had lived in the Rosenwald building [Rosenwald Apartments; Michigan Boulevard Apartments, Chicago, Illinois] whose, whose daughter was a friend of ours until she died not too long ago.  And, so this woman, Doris Havice [Doris Webster Havice], who wrote a wonderful book called 'Roadmap for A Rebel' was early on somebody who was--I think she had a divinity degree in the '20s [1920s] when women weren't supposed to do that.  One can Google her.  It's a whole new experience.  But, anyway, Doris had heard from our friend, Mrs. Evans [ph.], that we had gone there.  And so, her immediate--and this was Boulder [Colorado] to us, this was our experience at Boulder from the get-go--was we get this note, and these flowers on the porch, and said, I will be back, welcome.  And so, we became very close with her family and she, because of her activity on the, with the Y, invited me, as a very young person--I was maybe twenty-four at that point--to be a member of the Y board at the university.  And I remember at one point, we were struggling over some issue.  And I don't know what it was that, that made this come to me.  But it suddenly occurred to me, you know, something, white people don't know everything.  They don't have all the answers.  Now, I knew this intellectually.  I had been raised around people of every kind, but I think that somewhere in the psyche of black people in this country has been a sort of, father, may I, you know, sort of a plantation mentality that says that, that somehow, somewhere, somebody else has the answers.  And I understood it in my gut for the first time because we were struggling over solving some kind of problem.  And I suddenly realized, you know, nobody has the answers.  You have to figure them out, and the world will follow you if you're green, if it thinks that you have the answers.  And that was a really big turning point again in my life because what I had understood intellectually--I mean, had always understood that people are people.  And we always had people of all kinds in our lives, and never felt any differences.  And I would have been surprised to have thought that I had not gotten to that deep level until it happened.  You know, it's just all of a sudden, it was, oh, you know.  Nobody has any more answers than you can find.  I think it's one of the best lessons that anybody can learn.  I think it's the kind of thing that Barack Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] has helped people really get a hold of, you know.  We are all the answer.  You know, it's, it's not up to waiting for somebody else to figure things out.  We have to figure it out.  So, that was fun, that was a--.
Story_ID: 443776
Speaker 1: You spoke about the year that your, that you divorced, and then you remarry, and then your husband [William Cline] passes away.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And then you talk about--well, talk a little bit about the years that follow after your husband passes away.  And, actually, how do you get to the point where--well, well, take us to how you get to Peabody [Peabody Conservatory of Music; Peabody Institute, Baltimore, Maryland] (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Oh, well, all right.  Well, one thing is I ended up going to Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana] on a Danforth Fellowship.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was, again, I walked into somebody's office--what am I going to do?  This was the year we were divorced.  What am I going to do?  I, I had wanted to go back to do a doctorate years before, but I thought why do that, if I don't have anything?  I don't have enough life experience to do something original, but this seemed an ideal time.  So. I went to talk to one of the administrators at the University of Colorado [Boulder, Colorado].  And he said, do you know anything about these Danforth Fellowships?  And I didn't, so he told me about them.  And I applied and I got one, which was wonderful because it, it was for women at that time, and it paid for everything that you needed to do.  And I could go around the country once I got one, and decide where I wanted to go to school, you know, where I wanted to apply.  I ended up going to Indiana University, which was a wonderful experience, because I could do so many things musically there, which I did.  And I went, I started grad school when I was forty.
Story_ID: 443777
Speaker 1: And I was there with, with two teenagers [Cline's children, Jonathan Cline and Joy Cline Phinney], one of whom went to Northfield Mount Hermon School [Gill, Massachusetts], 'cause he had always wanted to go there.  He wanted to take Latin and he got a scholarship.  We didn't have, otherwise, any means to send him.  And my daughter was in, in middle school.  She was in eighth grade and quite an athlete.  I don't know if I ever talked about that, but that also was a wonderful couple of years.  After the first year, as I told before, we, my husband [William Cline] and I got married again 'cause it just seemed that our main focus for both of us was the children, and much easier to do that together than separately.  But sometimes, you have to be separate to find that out what those basic values are.  But then, we were still back and forth, and back and forth because I was one place, he was one place, the kids were two other places.  And then, when we finally all got home one year, then he died at the end of that year in '78 [1978].  I was still in grad school [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana].  And so, I would sort of go back and forth.  And then, I also had to figure out how to get a job.  But at that point, the children were both, both at Northfield Mount Hermon School, which was one of the fortunate things. We had figured out how to do to try to find some kind of stability for them because we had, we knew we were moving to New Jersey [Princeton, New Jersey] for a year, having no idea he would die after we--shortly after we got there.  So, I'm back, and I think I told you the [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou story.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 443778
Speaker 1: So, I'm back in Bloomington [Indiana], and just trying to, you know, drive eighteen hours on the weekend up to watch my kids [Jonathan Cline and Joy Cline Phinney] in track meets, and things like that.  And then, I, I--that fall, after my husband [William Cline] died, I went to, I was on the Oberlin alumni board.  And I was talking with the president of Oberlin [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio], who was Emil Danenberg then.  And he said, "Well, what will you do now?"  And I said, "I don't really know, but I know that I don't want to go back and start, you know, as a forty-some-year-old in a junior faculty position some place."  I, I couldn't see it.  I'm, I'm not a performer like that.  I, I want to take something about all the experience that I've had in teaching and, and running a choir.  I was a church organist for almost twenty years.  I'd done a lot of things and a lot of community work, too.  And he told me, he said, go talk to J. Stanley Ballinger who, at that time, was the president of New England Conservatory [New England Conservatory of Music, Boston, Massachusetts], and had been a dean at Oberlin.  And he thought we would really get along.  So, I did, I went to Boston [Massachusetts], and I talked with Stan, and it was very interesting.  We had long talks, and he said, you know, I think you'd be a good administrator because that's what Emil had thought.  And I said, I don't know anything about administration.  So, that's when he told me to go and talk to Stan.  And so, he told me to go--he said, "Do you know anything about NASM," which is the National Association of Schools of Music?  And I didn't.  And he said, "They're having their annual meeting in Colorado Springs [Colorado]; I'll get you invited to it."  Well, I had to come back out to Colorado to take care of legal things then anyway about that time, so I did, and I went to that.  And he said, "You'll see at that meeting that not everybody who goes to those meetings are great administrators, and you'll understand what I mean."  So, I went and find, yeah, he was right because there was a lot of bureaucratizing, or whatever, a lot of bureaucratic thinking, and stuff, that I didn't think had a lot to do with music.  But then, I heard one talk by somebody called Bob Trotter, who was at one of the schools, Robert Trotter.  And I was very privileged years later to give one of the first Robert Trotter lectures for the College Music Society.  That was really inspiring.  He really got the idea of what music can do for people, what music teachers can do to help develop the lives and the sensibilities, and just the character, and the spirit of people.  And so, he was right.  That was, that was a really great experience.  And then, the dean of Oberlin, at that time, David Bow [ph.], I knew from being on the alumni board.  And so, David invited me--it was a Monday night, I still remember, to dinner.  It was me and eight male deans.  And it turned out, they were the deans of the maj-, all the major conservatories, see, because NASM largely is music departments and universities and, and some smaller schools.  And it wasn't so much geared to conservatories, so the conservatory guys would sort of get together.  So, I had--we must have spent four or five hours of dinner together.  There was a dean from Yale [Yale School of Music, New Haven, Connecticut]; from Oberlin; from the Cleveland Institute [Cleveland Institute of Music, Cleveland, Ohio].  I think then, from Michigan [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan]; from New England Conservatory; from Juilliard [The Juilliard School, New York, New York].  It was just major stuff.  We had so much fun.  And I discovered that, for instance, one of them had been the roommate of Andy Billingsley [Andrew Billingsley], who was my sister's [HistoryMaker Amy Tate Billingsley] husband, who had been on, on a, on a year away at Grinnell College [Grinnell, Iowa].  So, they'd known one another, and we had that connection.  This was the dean at Yale, Phil Nelson [Philip Nelson].  And so, it was just a lot of, again, discovering common ideals about what we thought should be happening to people in music.
Story_ID: 443779
Speaker 1: So then, not too long after--oh, and one of the people there, who I liked a lot, was Phil's [Philip Nelson] executive assistant at Yale [Yale School of Music, New Haven, Connecticut].  And Phil had gotten this guy, who'd gotten his doctorate at Yale, and gone out to teach in Reno, Nevada.  And Phil had said to him, you know, you have too much talent to get stuck out somewhere, come back to Yale, and I'll just find something for you to do for a while.  We'll figure out what else you can do.  So, he became his executive assistant, sort of his gofer.  And he was the one who was arranging for us to--we had a snowstorm--arranging for us to get up to Denver [Colorado] to catch our planes and everything.  Well, that guy happened to be Joe Polisi [Joseph W. Polisi] who, for years now, has been the, the president of Juilliard [The Juilliard School, New York, New York], extraordinary man.  And to know him at that point, and to see how his philosophy, and how a mentor like Phil helping somebody, recognizing a talent and, and activating it, is a very important thing that any of us can do.  And that also has been a large motivating thing for my professional life.  So, a while later, when I knew I just had to find a job, had kids who were about to go to college, no money for it.  My son got a miraculous Bell Labs scholarship.  I mean, we just applied for things anyway.  Even (unclear) said, why are you letting your son apply to all these expensive schools that you can't possibly afford?  And I said, because if anything would have broken his father's [William Cline] heart, it would have been to think that this kid, who was so interested in so many things, would think that he couldn't go where he wanted to go.  So, he did, and he got into all bunch of top schools.  And here comes March when acceptances are there--beginning of April, how are you going to do this?  I didn't know, but I was sort of too busy to worry about it.  And then, I got a phone call from a friend in Boulder [Colorado] who said have you heard about anything about Bell Laboratory scholarships and I said no.  He said, well, I do, and I know somebody there, and I think I'd like to recommend Jon [Jonathan Cline] for one.  Well, not to go into a whole long story, he got one that paid for four years of tuition, room, and board, books, everything, travel, so I didn't have that worry, plus a summer job.  It was, it was wonderful, and he had a lot of flexibility.  He could use it at any school to which he had already been admitted.  See, so if we had waited to see, he would never have applied to any of those schools, so we had a choice of Caltech [California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California], of Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California], of Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], all kinds of places, Princeton [Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey].  And he ended up going to Stanford, which was just right for him.  And it allowed him to do broader than just an engineering kind of thing 'cause he has a lot.  And he did a lot of things on semesters in Europe, and stuff like that.  My daughter [Joy Cline Phinney] ended up going to Juilliard.  Again, another sort of an amazing thing that came up.  By then, I was in New Haven [Connecticut], and I got to New Haven because I was still trying to figure out how am I going to get a job, and not having a lot of time to worry about it, but knowing from everything else in my life, that somehow or another, it would appear.  And, so I, I asked Phil Nelson about it.  And he had called and said, "There's going to be an opening at Neighborhood Music School [New Haven, Connecticut].  You should apply for it."  And that was a community music school there.  And that seemed sensible because I knew a lot about community music.  So, I applied, and kind of worked through that and that's--how that worked out as a book (laughter).
Story_ID: 443780
Speaker 1: You were getting ready to talk about the Neighborhood Music School [New Haven, Connecticut].
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, when I applied, it's interesting, I didn't even know how to put together a resume because I, I had--everything up to then was sort of experience, you know, things that I had done as a community person, as a, as a studio teacher, as doing bits and pieces of things.  And so, I tried to put together a--what is that all about?  What has my experience been all about?  So, I started to put together a resu-, a resume that I still have it, according to areas of experience because I couldn't say, I had this big job, and that big job and that.  But I had areas of experience, and some of them led up to administration.  And I thought, yeah, you know, I know a lot about communities.  This is a community music school.  I know a lot about people.  I know a lot about teaching, public school teaching, piano teaching, my music ed [music education] background.  I had learned a lot about the instrumental teaching, so it seemed that I could be useful there.  And so, I applied, and I had a hilarious weekend going to interview.  And, again, I had many things happen which--you just read my book if I ever get it done.  But I talked with them a lot when I was there, and I was very candid about what I saw.  One of the things I was interested in was that they had a, a program.  They had a lovely new school down near Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], but they also had an auxiliary school in a place they called the hill, in a wonderful old sort of historic building.  The students were all black there.  And as I talked with them, and they were describing it, I said, "You mean that's your black branch?"  And I, I think they were kind of shocked, but I mean that was literally what I was hearing.  And those kids didn't necessarily come downtown for reasons that, that, you know, people often don't.  So, that was of interest to me.  And I, you know, I said, "Well, I thought, you know, it was kind of interesting to see how we could develop the school, so that it would be more of a place where all the kids came."  So, I left and then, a while later, I was actually in a St. Louis [Missouri] motel because I was doing a, a--judging for a National Guild of Piano Teachers.  I would go around from time to time and do that.  And I get a call from this wonderful man, that I have known since then for years, who called from the Neighborhood Music School board, to tell me that I had not gotten the job.  And I was surprised because so many things had sort of worked out in sort of a miraculous way, (unclear) getting there, all kinds of things in my travel.  And it just seemed like it was the right thing.  And he told me years later--he said it was the most interesting thing because you said to me--and I'm sure I can't say the same way now--he said, oh, she said, he said, you said, oh, that's my job.  And I--sure I couldn't have said it quite that way, but that's basically what I said.  And it's certainly what I felt that I, you know, but that was--I, I was sure that was my job.  Well, you know, so we had a nice chat after that and hung up.  And I started thinking about it.  I didn't have any other options for the next year.  But, again, I wasn't worried about it.  And I, it was the week before Easter, I still remember that.  And I thought about the tomb that they had put Jesus in, and that reading somewhere that there were no rock-ribbed walls of the tomb that could keep Him in there--just that whole concept, that in spite of the fact that there were these stone walls, they put a stone in front of them.  And they couldn't keep Him in there, that the Spirit of the Christ was so strong, and so much the essence of who He was, that these rock-ribbed walls couldn't contain it.  And I thought, you know, there can't be any rock-ribbed walls that could keep me from expressing the qualities that all of my life I had been led to develop and express for the benefit of the rest of mankind, which was the way I always thought of it.  And, so I started thinking about what the rock-ribbed walls were.  You know, the rock-ribbed walls that say a woman can't do this job, the rock-ribbed walls that say a black person can't do this job.  I tried to think of, of things that society would say would make this impossible.  And I just simply thought to myself, none of that can get in the way of the best qualities that I can give to this situation.  And I let it go.  And I wasn't surprised when a couple of days later, I get a call from him saying, "Hey, you know, what?  The person we offered the job to didn't take it, so the job is yours."  And I probably said something like, "Well, I knew it would have been," (laughter).
Story_ID: 443781
Speaker 1: But, anyway, so I went and did that, and it was very hard.  I loved it.  I did things that, you know, it was one of those things I think I find off, and as a black female, you get some opportunities to do things, and people want to be progressive and so on.  But bottom line often, they don't really think you're going to do it.  I mean, they don't really think you're going to make any changes.  They don't really understand the idealism that, that drives us and the perceptivity, and the determination to be inspired, and make some kind of a difference.  So, there were things that I did that, you know, people didn't like.  They resist change.
Speaker 2: What were, what were some of these things?
Speaker 1: They didn't like the efforts.  I take--go out in my VW [Volkswagen] bus.  I'd go out to the hill, and I'd bring some of those kids down to take their lessons downtown.  There was a wonderful black teacher in the public schools who taught Orff, the Orff musical background [Orff Schulwerk], and she wanted to, she had not been allowed to teach at Neighborhood Music School [New Haven, Connecticut] before, you know, and I couldn't quite understand why because she was a very good teacher, but she wanted to start an Orff class for disabled kids (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What--
Speaker 1: --for cerebral palsy kids.
Speaker 2: Explain to me what Orff is.
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't think I can.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It, it's, it's from Middle Europe, a, a particular way of using instruments and voice to experience music.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It's not just like playing the piano, or playing the flute, or something like that.  And she was developing a program for cerebral palsy kids that she wanted to have a center for.  I thought it was fascinating.  And so, I said, yes, you can do that.  And I, I think for some of the people at Neighborhood Music School at the time, that was not their idea of what they wanted the school to be.  I think they saw it as being sort of their, their elite music training place for, you know, kids who came from certain families.  And I understood that, and it was, and it still could be, but I didn't see any reason that it should not include these other children.  And so, I let her set up the Orff class.  And some of the kids were in wheelchairs.  We, we had to build a ramp, you know, ramps around the building so they could get in.  It had to be one of the most touching things you would ever see.  And there was a, a Hartford [Connecticut] television station that did a program on it.  You had kids who were so severely impaired, but you could see how the effect of this music had on them.  And she was just wonderful with them.  And I think that there were, there were forces there.  There were organizational problems there.  I was the only really professional arts person there.  And it was sort of run by a board of, and council of seventy people, you know, a lot of whom were taking lessons at the school.  It was very complex.  I had--the Yale School of Organizational Management [New Haven, Connecticut] did a study on it.  And they confirmed what I recognized was an organizational difficulty.  And I have to tell you when I showed it to the board, some of whom were wonderful people, but some of whom just didn't get it.  They would say, oh, they don't know what they're talking about.  So, I mean, that was the kind of thing, and so it was difficult and I, and I finally decided to just leave.  You know, I said, this is not going to work--I mean, after almost two years, it is not going to work if I'm trying to do something that you really don't believe it.  So, I said, here's how much we've gotten done.  We got a whole lot done.  And I said good luck, thank you, goodbye, and finished some things that I needed to do.  And it was, you know, they were very cordial.  I was cordial, but I said, this is what I have to do.  And, this is not the place to go into all of that.
Story_ID: 443782
Speaker 1: But that spring when I was still finishing up my dissertation [at Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] because all of this time, I had been moving children and, and moving.  We must have moved with our VW [Volkswagen] bus in about ten times, ten times in ten years.  And we were, at that time, living in a wonderful house that a friend had, had invited us to live in while he and his wife were on sabbatical in New Haven [Connecticut].  So, I had a good place to work.  I was able to bring my mother [Inez Duke Tate] there when she was ill, in her final illness, to live with us there, and that was a great place.  And so, it was just--there were lots of good things.  And that- I was thinking, all right, now what next, and writing reports and, and helping frame the things that we'd been doing.  And I decided at that point--Joe Polisi [Joseph W. Polisi], who I mentioned earlier, had gotten this miraculous job out of having been, been running, and developing the alumni office at Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] as part of his duties there.  All of a sudden, we find he's dean of the Manhattan School of Music [New York, New York].  And that Phil [Philip Nelson] had, had encouraged him, even though he was working with him, to go down there every day, and learn what's going on, so that by the time he started actually as the dean, he really knew the school, he knew a lot.  It was a fascinating thing to watch.  So, I went down toward the end of his first year there to have lunch with him, and was just asking--I remember saying, what makes it work 'cause I knew I was interested in some kind of administration, but I had no idea.  And I wanted it to be more college administration, but I didn't know how one does that.  And so, I asked him how he was managing to do so well 'cause he was already having a great reputation.  And I remember he thought for about three seconds, trying to frame his answer, and he said, you know, I like to see people succeed.  And that is, I have followed his career, has been the most important thing.  And I've been on accrediting teams for the Middle States Accrediting Association, you know.  I've been on teams to credit Juilliard [The Juilliard School, New York, New York], and some of the other schools, so I've watched all of this.  And that has been the key, as I think, to his success.  And his tremendous effectiveness as a major administrator in these times has been underlying his, his underlying motive that he likes to see people succeed, to try to facilitate other people's success.  And that resonated so well with what I've always tried to do, although I don't know I was ever quite as skilled at it as he, but that was it.  And he asked me if I had ever heard of this guy, Bob Pierce [Robert O. Pierce], down at Peabody [Peabody Conservatory of Music; Peabody Institute, Baltimore, Maryland], and I said no.  He said, I think he's doing kind of a good job, and I think they have some openings down there.  You ought to look into it.  Well, I didn't.  And a couple of weeks later, he calls, said, "Did you ever look at it?"  And I said, "No."  And somebody else came by my house, who had been down there, and said, "Do you know anything about it?"  And I thought, well, that's a sign.  So, I had to go to Washington [D.C.] for something, and I stopped by to visit.  And I was interested in the job of associate dean which I--you know, the paperwork would say, well, you haven't done all the things that go up to an associate dean.  But was the only one that interested me.  They had an executive assistant to the, to the director of the school, and that didn't interest me, nor did it pay enough money (laughter).  They had assist-, assistant dean for student affairs, which was not the direction I wanted to go as, you know, I had, had a lot of experience with students and with my kids' [Jonathan Cline and Joy Cline Phinney] friends.  And that was not my idea of what I was interested in, in developing musical education for people.  But the associate deanship was sort of interesting.  So, I went down and I talked with the director, with the dean, the then-dean and--
Speaker 2: And who, what was his name?
Speaker 1: Robert Pierce.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And he was sort of new at it also and, you know, a courageous man who was trying--this was a school which, at that time, was in a lot of difficulty, had, had during the '70s [1970s], it had gotten to the point of--its endowment was down to less than a million dollars.  And it had ultimately--Johns Hopkins [Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland] had thought this was a great school, you know, why are we going to let this die?  We don't have a music thing, so they began to bring Peabody into their university thing.  And they, they worked out something with the legislator, legislation, the legis-, well, anyway, they worked out something that, in which the legislator, the legislature did.  They worked out a sort of a support for Peabody over a period of years where this, the legislature would put in a certain amount, Hopkins would put in a certain amount.  And Peabody really got on its feet.  Well, Bob and I were sort of in on the beginning of that.  The director at that time, who was not well and was retiring, was Elliott Galkin, and he had a real vision about that.
Story_ID: 443783
Speaker 1: So, but it was Bob [Robert O. Pierce] who interviewed me [at Peabody Conservatory of Music; Peabody Institute, Baltimore, Maryland] and he said, we don't have--you know, the associate dean's position is pretty much spoken for.  And I said, "Well, okay."  And he said, "But I want you to read this report that we just have had done about the prep, since I had come from essentially a preparatory school."  And so, he said, "Tell me what you think of it."  And I looked at it, and I said, "Well, let me take it with me," because it's not the kind of thing you want to just blow off about.  So, I had to go to Indiana, to Bloomington, that summer to do some more work on my dissertation [at Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana], which I just kept hauling around with me.  And I sat down, and I wrote a six-page critique of it because it was very interesting, and it was something that I could make a contribution to.  And so, they really appreciated it, and then they called me and said--his secretary said, "Mr. Pierce would like for you to come to interview for the job of assistant dean for student affairs."  And I said, "But I told him that wasn't the one that I was interested in."  And she said, "Yes, but, you know, we'd like you to come anyway, because then, you can get to know the school a little and everything."  And I thought--well, I've got to go to New York [New York] anyway.  They're going to pay for me to come, so I went.  And we had this interview that was hilarious.  We're up in the board room.  They're interviewing me for the student affairs job, and I basically was saying, these are the things that I've already done, and I've done with my kids, and I don't remember what else, but it was not always just about that job.  So, we came out, we were walking downstairs, and Mr. Pierce says, "Well, you sure came across flat in that."  I said, "Yeah, but I told you I wasn't interested in it," (laughter).  And he said, "Well, but something you said made me think that maybe we should think about the associate dean for, for academic affairs."  And I said, "Well, that would interest me."  He said, "Can you stay tonight," 'cause I have to go home at five, "and come back tomorrow?"  And I had to leave--I said, "No, I can't, I can't stay after today because I have to go to New York."  And it was--he looked at me so funny, like, you know, but we're giving you this great opportunity, and you're not just jumping all over us.  But, you know, you don't live life that way, you know, when you have something that you're supposed to be doing.  And so, bless his heart--he said, well--I said, "I'm just sorry, I can't stay.  I can, I can be here after five."  And he said, "Well, I'll stay then."  So, we met after five and had a nice chat, and then, I went on about my business.  And then maybe three days, and--when I was back in Bloomington, I get a call from his secretary saying, "We'd like to offer you the job of, of the associate dean for academic affairs."  What do I do?  I say, "Let me think about it," (laughter).  And then I, you know, talked to a friend in the business.  And, and he said, "No, it probably would be a good move for you, but you should ask for more money."  So, I called back and I said, "I think I would like to do it.  I'd be honored to do it, but I do need this much."  And, again, I think it was sort of a surprise because one of the things that--maybe my, my former life that I've talked about so much, sort of oriented me toward not thinking that I had to go begging for something, and not thinking that I was any lesser.  And it seemed that- it seemed logical that you're a professional person, you expect professional level activity, and you know, you're going to give everything you can to it.  And so, there was no reason to just jump and say, oh, this will be my only chance in the world, that I just got to grab this job under any circumstances 'cause I never felt that way.  So anyway, so I did it.
Story_ID: 443784
Speaker 1: And I arrived [at Peabody Conservatory of Music; Peabody Institute, Baltimore, Maryland] the day before school started with my loaded VW [Volkswagen] bus up to the gilt 'cause that's the way we were doing things at that point.  And I lived for that year--my sister, or her husband [Andrew Billingsley] at that time, was president of Morgan State [Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland].  And I lived in the--above their garage in one room.  My sister has been the savior of my life.  I mean, through all those years when we were pretty much nomads in a way, Amy [HistoryMaker Amy Tate Billingsley] was always there, you know.  I could, we could always be at her house.  You could always call her at three o' clock in the morning, wake her out of a dead sleep, and the first thing she would say is: "What can I do for you?"  And I think that most of her friends now who know her will say the same thing.  She just is the most giving person, and she was a real rock for me through some very hard times, you know. I did what I had to do.  And I always knew that Amy was there.  And so, I lived at her house for a year.  I couldn't afford to live any place else and while I got used to that job.  And the interesting thing was that toward the end of that year, Mr. Pierce [Robert O. Pierce] then was--Galkin [Elliott Galkin] was retiring.  Mr. Pierce was being considered for director of the institute.  And he said, if I am appointed director, I'd want you to be dean 'cause we'd already worked together, and we both were kind of learning things new.  And, meanwhile, I had a call from the president of New England Conservatory [New England Conservatory of Music, Boston, Massachusetts] asking me if I'd consider being the dean there, which I really wanted to go to Boston [Massachusetts].  But when I told Mr. Pierce that, that was when he said if they appoint me director, I would appreciate it if you'd be the dean.  And I thought, this man went out on a limb and (unclear) to bring me there in the first place.  And I didn't feel that I could say no.  So, I told New England if he becomes the director and appoints me dean, then I can't come to New England, and that's exactly what happened.  So, that's how I ended up being dean of the Peabody Conservatory.  And the idea was that there was just lots to get done there.  And I did know that I--and I already knew a lot of the faculty people and, and about their backgrounds and things from some research studies that I had done, and from my own professional involvements as a, as a piano teacher.  So, it was not a new environment.
Story_ID: 443785
Speaker 1: Before we got into some of the things that you did at Peabody [Peabody Conservatory of Music; Peabody Institute, Baltimore, Maryland], you talk about your dissertation.
Speaker 2: Oh--.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) You want to tell us about it?
Speaker 2: It was on piano competitions.  And I was interested in that because, as a piano teacher in Boulder [Colorado], and, and with the whole clack of piano teachers around the country, piano competitions were getting to be sort of big thing.  And I was noticing that people would get--so they weren't even speaking to each other over some of these competitive things.  And then, there was the big Van Cliburn [Van Cliburn International Piano Competition] win, and I was just interested in the dynamics that were happening after that.  So, I thought by the time I got to Indiana [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] in '75 [1975], and had to choose a dissertation topic, I was, I thought this would be a great topic to do.  So, I developed a, a topic on piano competitions, which ended up being probably the, the one as a groundwork, probably the most important piece of work on piano competitions, on international piano competitions.  And it just took me a long time because I was almost finished with everything, except the dissertation, when my husband [William Cline] died.  And I still remember.  And then, we were moving and moving and moving, and getting a job, getting kids [Jonathan Cline and Joy Cline Phinney] into school.  And I got to my limitation, my seven-year thing, and I went to talk to my advisor at IU [Indiana University], and I apologized.  I said, "You know, I'm sorry, this is taking me so long, you know, I got to ask for an extension."  He said the sweetest thing to me.  He, he looked at me, and he said, "When you came here," he said, "you did a fantastic job."  He said, "You got As in all your classes."  And to, to me, I wasn't interested in that anyway at that age.  I was just having a good time.  There were all these things that I was getting to go to school and learn and do.  And he said, "You were the best student we've had in--I don't know how long.  You aced this, that, and the other.  You did this, but you're constantly," then he looked at me, he said, "It was not your fault that your husband died."  And I thought, I almost wept because I wasn't trying to use that as an excuse.  But, indeed, you know, when I had to keep picking up, we were living in one room half the time, and it, it was a complicated thing.  And so, I would pack up the dissertation, and off it would go.  And when I had a chance, I'd start on it again.  So, I didn't finish until after I'd been dean at Peabody for a couple of years.  And people would say, "Well, why are you bothering to finish it?  You've already got this (unclear)."  I said, "Are you kidding?"  I mean, doing something like that is not--I didn't do this to get a job.  I did this because it was of interest.  I had wonderful support from the Danforth Foundation [St. Louis, Missouri] that stuck, stuck with me through it.  And it ended up being a really important, and very helpful, and interesting piece of work.
Story_ID: 443786
Speaker 1: But then, once I became dean at Peabody [Peabody Conservatory of Music; Peabody Institute, Baltimore, Maryland], the things that were of real interest to me, there were, there was a lot of difficulty with the curriculum.  And the school was struggling, as many schools were at that period of time.  It was almost the top drawer school, but it was having a hard time competing.  If you look at again the economic situation, everything going on then, and so, Bob Pierce [Robert O. Pierce] and I hit the floor running.  And we had to develop faculty, we had to draw a better student body.  And that's hard to do because the temptation is to take whatever students will come and pay the money.  What we did instead was to make the standards tougher, to give the students more support in what they were doing, but to expect a lot of them, to revamp the curriculum.  For instance, one of the things that I thought was important, there was a liberal arts requirement in the state, some thirty-some hours of liberal arts, that you had to have when you got a music degree.  And what they were doing was students would take their music degree.  And then at the end of it, they'd try to cram in, by correspondence courses, or something in their liberal arts.  And I thought that, that doesn't make sense and why have it.  The point of the liberal arts should be to help them develop their perceptual skills, and everything in their music, and what they then could do with it.  So, we revamped that program and, and I think did a wonderful core program, so that the students wove in their liberal arts in the first two years of their studies, the liberal arts and the skills.  So, at the end of the first two years, we were very tough about their abilities, because it used to be, they'd get to the end of four years, and maybe they wouldn't do so well.  And here, they would be out of school, and not really able to do anything in the music field, and too old and too late, and too unprepared to do anything else.  So, that, I thought we could fix.  And a lot of that came from my experience at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] because I had that liberal arts background.  I could see what a value it was to me as a musician.  And so, I was able to put that into play, and find some very good people to develop that program.  So, we did that.  That made a big difference at Peabody, I think.  And at the end of sophomore year, then students can realistically, with help of the faculty, say, you know, should I finish music school, or should I go to another school?  And at the end of a sophomore year, they had enough liberal arts and enough perspective on their own skills, that they could go to another college.  And that had not been possible before, so that was an important thing, I think, that we achieved.  I also found some problems with the graduate program that I doesn't need to go into here, but what we did was to develop two new graduate programs.  One was for people who were focusing mainly on performance.  And we developed a graduate performance diploma that did not have a huge academic component, but was a little bit like an artist diploma.  So--and that whole thing was very good--that and the way we developed our artist diploma, making it more competitive and more rigorous was really good.  I had learned a lot about that from Indiana [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana], which had a wonderful program in that, so we developed that at Peabody.  We developed the doctoral program with more of a performance component with--it seemed very important to me that people are going to get out of school, and they're going--people are going to ask them to talk about music, you know.  They'll have to give lectures and things, and how are we going to prepare them for that?  So, we, we worked with the curriculum to include that kind of training.  They had to give many more recitals.  Two of their recitals had to be lecture recitals where they did their research, and then they had to lecture to a group.  And more students have told me since then, more graduates that, that had just saved their lives.  They've gone into college jobs, various other jobs, the times that they had to give public presentations, and they have felt prepared.  So, I think we did a great job in terms of curriculum, bringing more really first-class faculty, being demanding of the faculty, in terms of what they were doing.  You know, I used to say, you know, we're only here to serve the students.  We're not here to serve the faculty, 'cause if we don't serve the students, we don't have a school.  And some of that, at that time, was not so popular because, you know, when you come into a situation, and people are accustomed to it the way it is, finding the way to have the leadership to change is not easy, but there was a lot of goodwill there.  I was nowhere near as skilled at the politics of doing that as I wish I had been.  I learned a lot of that later.  I think I always thought that just having the goodwill and the determination to do it was enough.  Well, it wasn't enough, but we still got a lot done, and I think the school prospered.  It--and there are a couple of other things that I can tell you about the students later.
Story_ID: 443787
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Let's talk about the students [at Peabody Conservatory of Music; Peabody Institute, Baltimore, Maryland], continue talking about the students--
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: --and the international students, and the black students that were enrolled--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and their successes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you can--.
Speaker 2: Well, I had just been saying that of talking with the faculty, and sort of being a real nudge with them about: we're there for the students. Because, you know, for all my life, if, if I could help students have the kind of wonderful musical experience that, in a sense, saved my spirit, and saved my life, that's what I wanted to do.  We had students there from all over the world.  One of the first things that I came across was some interesting things with the international students.  Sometimes I would have a, a mid-level manager in an office come to me furious because such and such a student from such and such a Middle Eastern country or something, lies to me.  They're just liars.  And I'm thinking, what's going on?  Well, I found that they would ask them sometimes questions that youngsters from certain cultures cannot say yes to, or cannot say no to me.  They had no understanding--some of these people who were wonderful people, but had never lived any place but Baltimore [Maryland], and had never known, personally, people like this.  And so, I found that I was constantly having to interpret the students to sometimes to the faculty, and very often, to the staff.  So, a lot of the student problems would end up coming to me 'cause there was this, this, this, and I talked to the student.  I would try to explain to everybody what was going on.  For instance, they had to learn that with certain Oriental cultures, for instance, it's very impolite to say no.  You have to say yes to everything.  So, if you don't understand how to ask the questions, and how to really understand what the issues are in a way that will help the student, you get a (unclear)--these people just get mad at them and say they were being dishonest.  There were some people from some of the Middle European countries who would say yes to something, and yes, that something had happened that wasn't quite true.  And they would come and say--well, they said so and so and so, and said, let me tell you, if that person said, told you in their country, if they told you what you wanted them to tell you, they'd be dead.  I mean, there were just things that--so there was a lot of that.  And since my whole background had been with a lot of international--a lot of experience with people from all over the world, that was a wonderful thing.  And I remember sitting in my office one day and thinking, every single experience I've ever had in my life, now makes sense, you know, whether it was mountain climbing, or whether some things that I had done that I thought, what am I doing this for, you know?  All of a sudden, the, the understandings that I had gained through some really hard things, or from some really odd things, they all made sense because there was never anything that came into my office--no problem with a student, a faculty member, a parent, an organizational thing that I didn't have some way to really understand.  And I think that made me feel so good because when you know that you can really help people by understanding them, that makes a big difference.  We were there--I was there when China, for instance, first began to let students come, and that was a hard thing, and hard for a lot of students.  A lot of them came with practically no money, and we helped them as we could, we encouraged them.  There are two, two sisters now who--I shouldn't have said sisters--anyway, two who are now in the Chicago Symphony [Chicago Symphony Orchestra].  A lot of them are very, very successful.  I still get a call every year saying, "Dean Cline [HistoryMaker Eileen Cline], if it hadn't been for you, we would not have this life."  You know, it--just the, the kind of encouraging them that, yes, you can do this, often having to run interference for them with things that they didn't understand, or having trouble with finding the money that they needed, not to just go get it, but to encourage them what to do.  One child who was trying to support her siblings, who had just themselves gotten out, was working in a bar late at night, and also playing.  She was fabulous.  And faculty getting angry because she didn't come to--she didn't want to play in an extra ensemble or something.  And I'd have to say, "Do you know what this child is doing?"  You know, and who later was supporting a whole family.  So, it was being able to understand that, and pull it all together, and help the pieces.  I've often thought of myself as being a bridge because when you can understand lots of pieces of things, then you can help people understand one another.

Speaker 1: And then, of course, there was the big push because, and sort of--I don't know how to say it--but black students were always put in a kind of niche.  And there was a certain--well, we're going to get these black kids coming here, and they will want to let them in, whether they were prepared or not, and then, be hard on them once they got there.  That didn't make a lot of sense to me.  And I knew, as they did not, that there are a lot of qualified black students out there.  But if people don't know them, they don't know.  And so, we began to find, first place, more students who were qualified, some students who weren't, but were able.  And so, we had to figure out, could we, what could we do to get them to the point where they could really deal with the curriculum that we were having, but not to let them in if they couldn't?  I mean, it just didn't make any sense.  We were doing that with the white students, so why shouldn't we do it with the black students, you know?  We, we made the curriculum tough enough that if they couldn't, if they couldn't pass certain criteria up front, they didn't get in.  It's very hard to get into the doctoral program, but as I said to them, something I learned from my son's [Jonathan Cline] experience at Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] (laughter)--here I'm talking too fast again--if we let them in, it is our business to be sure that they finish because if we have the right standards, and then we do the right kind of teaching once they get there, they should all graduate.  And they should all do well.  So, that was our theory, and it pretty much worked.  I, I think it's an important theory when you work with students, make the expectations clear, and then give them everything they need to be successful, and expect that they meet those expectations.  And so, that was a lot of fun.  I loved doing that.  So I--we began to discover, 'cause at that time they were checking how many black students are there in the various conservatories.  All of a sudden, it was discovered at Peabody [Peabody Conservatory of Music; Peabody Institute, Baltimore, Maryland], there were more than any place else.  Why was that?  For one thing, I think black students started coming there because I was there.  And, and, you know, they didn't necessarily say so, but it would be clear to them that there was going to be a respectful, shall I say, presence there in the administration because there wasn't always.  And students were very accustomed to going places, and being dissed in one way--being not understood.
Speaker 2: But this was also because through word of mouth also?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, I mean, you know, the world works through word of mouth.
Speaker 2: Right.  So people experience--
Speaker 1: Their experience and they, yeah.
Speaker 2: --and, they would just--.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, okay.
Speaker 1: And it was also interesting to find that before too long, I remember the year being so surprised that practically every principal position in our major orchestra was held by an African American student.  And I don't think anybody ever noticed it.  They just happened to be the best ones in that area.  And it didn't occur to anybody that this should have been unusual at this point.  And I think that's because of the general atmosphere that we had been--developed in the school.
Story_ID: 443789
Speaker 1: Some of it was, there were three things that I had decided early on we were not going to do.  There were things protected by the constitution.  Kids kept coming--they wanted, they wanted a black student organization.  They wanted a gay and lesbian organization.  They wanted Christian, or some kind of other religious organizations.  These are three things we're not going to do at Peabody [Peabody Conservatory of Music; Peabody Institute, Baltimore, Maryland].  So now, if you want to do that in the larger, the larger community of Hopkins [John Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland], which has so many more students, you know, if you feel you need that, do that, but this is a very small school.  It had fewer than six hundred students and a very small campus.  And I said, I think that the most important thing here is going to be to develop your commonality.  You have something that you all share.  I don't want to see a lot of fragmentation, and people looking at them over there, and them over there, and them over there.  It's--you have something together.  Everything about your ensemble experience, every, is a together experience, and you're going to live in the world together.  So, I was very much like that.  And we had long talks about it and they got it.  So, that's basically what we did.  And I, again, many of them, afterwards, have said that in terms of their later experiences professionally, their later friendships, they said, so much of that was formed by that kind of an attitude at Peabody.  So, we had a community of a kind that is not always so usual.  I, I think we were respectfully protective of the shepherding.  I mean, we were stewards, you know, and your--and I used to say to the staff and the faculty a lot, you know, if we don't tend to these young people, this is the last time in their lives that any of them will ever have the kind of attention that we can give them, to helping them work their problems through, and things like that, because otherwise we just send them out with all of these problems.  And nobody has ever talked with them about, help them work through, so we did a lot of that, and, and that was very important.  It wasn't just a school that was saying, you know, crack the whip, get in there, do this.  That, to me, is not learning.  And, yet, there were some of, some of the best people in the profession.  One of our students, who has become very famous, was Awadagin Pratt, and you'll have to read about a whole (unclear).  He came there wanting to--ended up majoring in three things, but again, had Awadagin been someplace else, I think his story would have been very, very different.  At the beginning, I was new also, and we had really worked through stuff.  I mean, you had things.  We were in Baltimore [Maryland], mind you.  And he was running to a class one night, and police stopped him because he was a black man running.  And I mean, he's one of the most gifted people we had.  Everybody was (unclear).  They put him in jail because he said, "Why are you stopping me?"  "Uhh, handcuff you."  So, I mean, that's another long story.  It took us all night to get him out.  So, we had a lot of things that we were working for, but a lot of good supportive people to work with.  And I worked eighteen hour days, seven days a week, but my kids [Jonathan Cline and Joy Cline Phinney] were away at school, then in the work world.  And we finally found a house that we sort of all bought together that, and made a big music room.  So, we were able to gather people to make music, and it was kind of wonderful.  I think it meant a lot to a lot of people.
Speaker 2: It, it did make a big difference because actually the, the black student enrollment dropped when you left.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Didn't it?
Speaker 1: It did.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I'm not going to really comment on that but--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --yeah, it was, it was quite robust when--but and it, it's, it's not just a question of money.  I mean, we didn't do anything for black students more than we did for anybody else, you know.  It, it has to do with, with the encouragement of young people.  And if schools don't do that, they don't realize what a gift they miss.  Competitiveness is--can have the wrong kind of an edge.  If competition encourages people to do their best, to do better than they would if they were not pushed, then it's wonderful.  But if it's to do something against somebody else, then it's destructive.
Story_ID: 443790
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk about good competition.  As you said, you wrote your dissertation on piano competition.  And we were talking about the Van Cliburn competition.  So, let's talk about that a little bit.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I got involved with the Van Cliburn competition [Van Cliburn International Piano Competition], first in 1977, when I was starting to do research on my competition.  I mean, yeah, on my--
Speaker 1: On your dissertation?
Speaker 2: --dissertation.  I was still living in Boulder [Colorado].  Well, I had gone back to Boulder then, I guess.  And I remember driving my VW [Volkswagen] bus down to Fort Worth [Texas] to observe the competition and to interview some of the people down there.  And they were so welcoming.  I--those people in Fort Worth are really something else.  I mean, it was just--everybody was so nice.  And I got a lot of good information, and once I finished the dissertation, they started using that.  The Cliburn organization started using that.  Pretty much, everybody who came to work there had to read that first and that was really nice.  I became their guest every four years.  I would go down there and, and, you know, get invited to the, to the events and to the parties and everything.  And I, I have to say, Fort Worth, Texas is one of the wonderful places on the globe.  They're lovely people, and I learned a lot, and I think I was able to contribute a fair amount.  One of the things I noticed, though, in the course of the research, and I've seen even more so since then in, because after I left Peabody [Peabody Conservatory of Music; Peabody Institute, Baltimore, Maryland], I got involved in policy studies at the Institute for Policy Studies [at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland].  And cultural policy, arts policy was just beginning to be thought about at that point.  One of the things that I noticed is that if you look at some of the policy problems we've had in the arts and in the sciences, I trace a lot of it back to 1958.  Van Cliburn won this huge Moscow [Russia] thing, and ticker tape parade in New York [New York].  That was about the same time, the Sputnik.  And the mentality of the United States then was the way we're going to be able to complete with the cold world is to be the best of everything.  Look, now we're competitive in the arts, and we want to be competitive in the sciences, and send a man to the moon and all of that.  And a lot of focus began to happen on specialized schools.  You had children who showed some interest in the arts, put into special school for the arts, kids in special sciences schools, and so on.  I remember thinking one thing they didn't realize is that those scientists who were so successful in Russia, were really doing the arts in kindergarten; and I mean they were, they were very developed.  That part of the brain does it. But I think that the United States was very focused on that kind of almost vocational training for a long time.  It's just beginning to come out of it a little bit.  Some of what happened then was that with the competition thing, you had a lot of people getting in it to get famous, to make money, forgetting that what used to drive all the musical activity in the years leading up to the Cliburn was love of music.  People made music because they loved it.  And it was inspiring, and they had competitions, and they had audition kinds of things.  They were all over the country, but they were they were more for joy.  There were a handful of professional competitions, like the Naumburg [Naumburg International Piano Competition] that started in the '30s [1930s] to help people develop careers.  But that was sort of a small part of musical activity in this country.  Then it got to the point where everything was how good can you be, and can you be better than everybody else?  And everybody trying to get in on it.  And the whole business of making music sort of went by the boards for a lot of people.  You had kids in schools not getting music because the talented kids were all in the arts schools.  And it was sort of, if you're going to really do music, you have to go to that particular school.  So, children in the mainstream were deprived of the, of the presence, and the, and the interest, and the activity of the children who were already artistically interested.  And a lot of the other children who get interested later anyway, but that was lost.  That influence was lost.  The same thing happened with the sciences.  That influence was lost, so that you had a mainstream of kids who did pretty well in other things.  But we ended up--it's no--I think it's no surprise that we ended up with a [U.S.] Congress that didn't know what to do with the arts, a Congress that still doesn't always know what to believe about the sciences because these are people who did not have, as they grew up, the daily contact with the kind of pretty normal arts and sciences thinking that we all need to grow up with.  And I think that Van Cliburn himself, though, back then, is one of the most wonderful people I've met.  He's such a giving person who made a conscious decision that he would devote the rest of his career after that 1958 to focus on encouraging others.  And that was a lot of what got the Cliburn competition going.  I noticed that now even--they're very involved in what happens in the schools in Fort Worth in particular.  They really encourage, they encourage their artists to go and give concerts in schools.  I think they've made a wonderful difference at--they have an amateur competition.  I think they've made a great difference in many, many people's lives beyond just who's going to be the next great artist because times change, you know.  People say, "Well, who won such and such a competition?"  Who knows 'cause there's been so many now, but I think that they're one of the few that have expanded themselves to make a broader impact on people's lives.  So that was--I think that's probably all I need to say about the Cliburn.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 443791
Speaker 1: Is there anything else that you wanted to talk about that we have not?
Speaker 2: I'll probably think of it at three o'clock this morning.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.  Well, what is your, your concern now about music and, and the arts in the school?  Do you have a concern about that today?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have some thoughts about it.  I think that there's more music going in the schools, in many schools, than people realize, for one thing.  I think when music has not been successful in the schools, it's been the fault of us teachers because when people have a good experience in music, then they want it to happen for others.  But when they're told, stand in the back of the chorus, and just mouth the words, 'cause your voice isn't good enough, what do you think they're going to think about music?  So, I think that some of that is self-made.  And as people have more good experiences, they're going to want more.  I have a lot of concerns about the focus on commercial music.  I think we're--but our whole era right now is so much into market values.  And who can get up there and yell and shake around, and make the most money?  And you have little kids wanting to do that, and not having the patience to sit down and just listen, and enjoy classical music.  However, I have never known anybody who had some exposure to really good symphonic music not to totally fall in love with it.  So, I think it's a question of exposure and of being able to hear.  You have people like Bobby McFerrin, people like Wynton Marsalis, who are fabulous in the, in the whole area.  People like that make a wonderful difference.  But I think that children need to have more exposure to it.  And somehow, it has to get beyond just the money-making thing.  There is a group that I worked with at the Kennedy Center [The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, Washington, D.C.] in the '90s [1990s], Goals 2000 [Goals 2000: Educate America Act], in the beginning of 2000.  And we noticed there's some wonderful research, and other programs going on around the country in the schools, research-based education, so there's some terrific things.  It's a big country.  There's a lot good, but I also remember at one point, we were trying to encourage schools to do this Arts 21 Project, and getting the message that in Marble, Colorado, they weren't having any of it.  And I thought, well, why not?  You know, it's a wonderful program.  And the next summer, I was out in Colorado and that Marble is near Aspen [Colorado], it's not far from Aspen.  I drove past Marble, and I thought, now I understand why they didn't want it.  If you think about it, people who are not from urban areas--what they see of a lot of the music is what they see on TV.  And people out in these areas, that's not what they want their children to learn.  So, they don't understand often that the kind of music that was going to be promoted in the schools was not what they were looking at on television.  And I couldn't blame them for saying no--we don't want our kids to learn how to go on television and learn just those kinds of things.  So, I think we have a, a complex society.  And we may be beginning to get a handle on how do we, how do we interact together, and work together with these wonderful tools that we have of music and education, and a lot of interesting things in the sciences, lots of foundations that are doing good things to bring people together to understand one another, to have common projects?  You know, we just--I think the future could be very interesting, but it's sure complex.  I'm glad I'm not trying to run it, you know.
Story_ID: 443792
Speaker 1: If you had to send a message to the future generation, what message would you send because, you know, this interview is going to be available for many, many years?
Speaker 2: I think, I think it would be that you have to never lose sight of the basics.  You have to never lose sight of what mankind is of the basic character of all man--the importance of curiosity, of courage, of being responsible, of caring for one another, of love.  And I remember one of the convocation talks that I gave, I based on a lot from Emerson [Ralph Waldo Emerson], who talks about the, the balance between love and work, the interrelatedness.  You can't have love without working at it.  You can't have really good work without love.  I would advise people to think about that, to recognize that, in the heart, we are all the same.  We just have to figure out how, and how to reach it.  My favorite definition of love is the consistent, persistent, ever-present consciousness of value.  And I think if people can think deeply about that, and love that way, that moves through many, many things.  It's, it's the basis of solving all kinds of problems because you can't solve problems if you're not willing to care about other people, and try to understand other people.  It all has to come from the inside, you know.  All the other stuff will go away.  All the rest of it will change.  Everything that is possible has always been possible since before the inventing of the wheel.  The development of it comes from the character of people wanting to be willing to see beyond the obvious, like Superman.  You know, the thing I always liked most about Superman was his X-ray vision, that he could see what other people couldn't see.  And I think I would always encourage everybody to think about that, try to see beyond the obvious, try to see beyond what people will tell you is all you can do.  You know, see beyond past history, and understand that all of history, in one sense, has already happened.  So, that's what I think--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and hope that it's useful.
Speaker 1: And it will be and inspiring, as your whole interview and your whole life story has been inspirational and encouraging.  And I'm sure it will be so for many, many generations.  So, I want to take this time to say thank you--
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: --for let-, allowing us to come back again--
Speaker 2: Oh, thank you.
Speaker 1: --to fill in the gaps to make sure that we had all of your, your wonderful life story.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I don't always know what's important.  See, I, I just think, this, you just go each day.  You just go, and you do what needs to be done.  And so, it's been helpful to me--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to think about what really--I might think is just normal, just survival, and the times when I've had a big problem come up, and I just said, Lord, don't I have enough grace yet?  Do I really have to have this experience?  And I would always understand--if you survive this experience, and you understand this experience, then you can help somebody else.  That's the only reason for having it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you.
