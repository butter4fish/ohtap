Speaker 2: A favorite food.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I'm scared to say 'cause my friends might invite me out to dinner and be ready to serve something great but say, oh, he doesn't like that or he doesn't eat that.  But I would--I would say--if I had to say, I would say stewed chicken, probably.

Speaker 1: Now, the last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?

Story_ID: 486009
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna a- ask you about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Revius Oliver Ortique, Sr.] side, but we'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Lillie Long Ortique.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: L-I-L-L-I-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And her, her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Long, L-O-N-G.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And we, we already know about Ortique, so.  And what, what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I don't know her, her date of birth.  I don't know that.  I probably, probably know it but I just can't think of it.
Speaker 1: Was it around 1900?  Somewhere around 1900?
Speaker 2: I would think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Her place of birth would be--let's see, mama was born in--
Speaker 1: Now, was she born in New Orleans [Louisiana] or outside of New Orleans?
Speaker 2: No, I think she was born outside of New Orleans.  I think she was born--yeah, wherever my grandmother [Mary Douglass Long (ph.)] lived, which was--I can't think of it at the moment, but I would think she was born outside of New Orleans.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, we'll get back to it.  We'll get back to it.  Now, what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back can you trace her side (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Very, very little because as I said before, my, my grandfather married my grandmother, who was black.  My grandfather, of course, was Chinese.  He was pure-blooded Chinese.  He was from, from a little place in China called Canton, C-A-N-T-O-N, and I said a little place, it's probably a fairly good size city.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it's bigger than most American cities (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Canton, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: From Canton.
Speaker 1: And his, his name was Lung (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Lung Yoke.
Speaker 1: Lung Yoke.
Speaker 2: L-U-N-G, Y-O-K-E, Lung Yoke.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And now, do you--can, can you tell us how he--I mean, what were the circumstances that brought him to America?
Speaker 2: Well, he decided--most, most Chinese lived on Bourbon Street at the Chinese home and, and worked from there, but he decided that he would branch out and he would start a laundry, and that's when he started as an owner of a laundry and branched out subsequently as the owner of a restaurant.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, he had a restaurant.  Were these--were these in the--on, on Bourbon Street or did he--or--
Speaker 2: No, he, he, he moved out and had--his restaurant was somewhere out in the French Quarter [New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you had a restaurant in the French Quarter.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was it a Chi- Chinese restaurant?
Speaker 2: Chinese restaurant.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he happened to, to decide to hire my grandmother to work in his restaurant and to eventually become manager of the, the restaurant.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then when he decided that he needed to, to, to re-fund his restaurant by going back to China and raising cash, he put my grandmother in charge of everything and she took charge and ran the restaurant.  Unfortunately, he never--he couldn't get back in time to save the restaurant, so he lost the restaurant and he lost nearly all of his money.
Speaker 1: So, so, he did come back.
Speaker 2: He eventually came back, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, but it was too late to save it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 486010
Speaker 1: Well, tell us something about your mother's [Lillie Long Ortique] mother.
Speaker 2: My mom--
Speaker 1: Your grandmother.
Speaker 2: My mother's mother was black.  She had started out by working in this restaurant and since my grand- grandfather [Lung Yoke] trusted her completely, she was able to become the head of the, the restaurant and managed it when he, when he decided that he would go back to China and raise some money from his people and then come on back and, and expand the, the restaurant.  Unfortunately, he didn't get a chance to come back as a restaurant owner because the restaurant virtually went broke and, and well, it was just--gone down, down, down.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But he did come back, right?
Speaker 2: He did come back, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, well, tell us something about--what, what was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: What was his name again?
Speaker 1: No, your grandmother's name, his wife, what was her name?
Speaker 2: Mary Long.
Speaker 1: Okay, Mary Long, okay.
Speaker 2: Mary Douglass Long [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay, Mary--
Speaker 2: She was from the--from the--amazingly, she was from the, the, the, the Douglass family, the, the famous Douglass--
Speaker 1: Oh, Frederick Douglass' family (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Frederick Douglass, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So--okay.  Is there any, any stories about, about her side of the family that, that are passed down in your family?
Speaker 2: Only that, that, that she tried--she knew that, that he had married her in order to give her independence from the, from black people.  I, I don't think he wanted her to be connected to the black folks.  He, he wanted her to be connected to Chinese folks.  But unfortunately, he--when he--by the time he got enough money to come back here, he was almost broke. He (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, so what did he do when he came back?  What, what did he do when he came back?
Speaker 2: He tried to rebuild the, the restaurant business, but it just wasn't--it wasn't working, and she wasn't able to manage it into a success that that they envisioned--
Speaker 1: So did--
Speaker 2: --and had--they needed to do so.
Speaker 1: Yes sir, but did they stay together?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they stayed together.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: They stayed together (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All right.
Speaker 2: And he did what he--what he could, but--because he knew he had left a, a big family, a whole lot of children here.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  So they--
Speaker 2: Seven or eight.
Speaker 1: Seven or eight children, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your mother had seven or eight sisters and brothers?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Your, your mother had seven or--seven sisters and brothers?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now what did your mother say about growing up?  Did, did she--I mean, how did she--what did she tell you about growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, she told us that they had a rough time, but they never--they never gave up hope that grandfather would come back with, with sufficient funds.  But, when he did come back, he was broke.  He went to live at the Chinese home on Bourbon Street [New Orleans, Louisiana] where all the Chinese lived.  Incidentally, his, his Chinese name was Lung Yoke.
Speaker 1: Right.  Do you know what that means?  Does, does it have a specific meaning other than--
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I don't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --think so.
Speaker 1: Now--okay, so, so did your mother have a chance to go to school?
Speaker 2: I think they all went to high school, but didn't none of them went to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do, do you know what school your mother went to?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.
Story_ID: 486011
Speaker 1: Okay, well let me ask you about your father's side of the family.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Revius Oliver Ortique [Revius Oliver Ortique, Sr.].
Speaker 1: His name is spelled just like yours, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, Ortique.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His place of birth is--was New Roads, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: New Roads?
Speaker 2: Yeah, New Roads.
Speaker 1: How do you spell Roads?
Speaker 2: N-E-W, R-O-A-D-S, R-O-A-D-S.
Speaker 1: Okay, New Roads, Louisiana.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what year was he born, do you know?
Speaker 2: Let's see, Daddy--I'd have to have some help from my--from my sister [Althea Ortique Watson].
Speaker 1: Okay.  But probably around 1900, too, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) About the same time as your mother.
Speaker 2: About that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what, what do you know about your father's side of the family?
Speaker 2: They were primarily uneducated.  Well, by, by that I mean they could read and write, but they, they were not educated people.  Therefore, he ended up with men- menial jobs, nothing special and was not able to control his, his education or his pursuit of, of employment.  So, he and my, my grandmother got married and started having children like crazy.
Speaker 1: Oh, this is your--this is your father's father you're talking about?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my father's father.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was his name?  Your grandfather?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What was your father's father's name?
Speaker 2: Revius O. Ortique, Jr. [sic.], I think?
Speaker 1: Oh, that, that was your--your father's name is Revius Ortique, Sr., right?  I mean--I mean, he was your--he has the same name as you and your--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What about your father's father?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I, I should know his name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, we can go past that, but--now, you were telling me earlier when I was asking you about your name that your, your father's people were from Haiti.  Are there any stories about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Nothing particular.  They, they just came here, which (unclear)--my, my, my grandfather, though, was a skilled pipe layer. And was, was hired in a position that no other black folks had ever been hired and had ever worked in and he was--he was paid higher salary than any other, other black people in New Orleans [Louisiana].  Being that, that he was kept in the position of, of being colored or, or black or whatever they called them during that time 'cause--so that they could pay him a limited amount.  White folks could pay him a limited amount of money.  They didn't have to pay him that first class wage that they were paying anybody else if they had been white.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, they gave him the job because--and he, he did a good job but they didn't have to pay him what they had to pay a white man.
Speaker 2: That's, that's right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: He, he, he did a good job.  He was very skilled.
Story_ID: 486012
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents [Lillie Long Ortique and Revius Oliver Ortique, Sr.] met, how your mother and father met?
Speaker 2: (Pause) I know there was a story, but I don't remember it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Maybe my sis- maybe my, my, my wife [Miriam Victorianne Ortique] might remember it.
Speaker 1: Okay, we'll just go past that and--let me ask you about their personalities.  I mean, what, what kind of personalities did they have and, and who do you think you take after the most, your mother or your father?
Speaker 2: I took after them about equally.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother because she wanted us to move ahead and be aggressive and not to pay any attention to the fact that we were black, don't let that--don't let that stop us.  My, my father was in a position to help us get sufficient employment and to make sure we understood that we weren't--we, we weren't just ordinary black folks.  We, we, we were from this Creo- so-called Creole stock and, and--
Speaker 1: So, he was proud of that.  He was proud of being Creole (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah.  He was proud.  He was proud, proud of being different from the ordinary Negro.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He didn't want to be just ordinary--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --and that's why he, he bought, bought a house on St. Louis Street [New Orleans, Louisiana], which is four blocks from Canal Street to raise his family and, you know, did a lot of things different from, from ordinary black folks.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Could he, could he speak Creole?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.
Story_ID: 486013
Speaker 1: Did you grow up in the 9th Ward [New Orleans, Louisiana] or did you--
Speaker 2: No, I, I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, okay.
Speaker 2: --didn't grow up in the 9th Ward.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I grew up in the--it must've been the 1st Ward [New Orleans, Louisiana] or the 2nd Ward [New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Well, can you describe your neighborhood and was, was it--was it a mixed group of people that lived over there or, or mostly Creoles or what?
Speaker 2: Mostly Creoles.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mostly Creoles.  And we weren't--we, we didn't--we didn't mix with the regular colored, normal colored person.  We, we--our, our playmates were Creoles.
Speaker 1: Now, was that something that your father [Revius Oliver Ortique, Sr.] like made a special point to tell you all when you were growing up, that you should mix with the ordinary black people?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I don't know.  I, I know we didn't have--we didn't have that, that, that, that full grown mixture of, of, of black folks to, to, to associate with, I know that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We, we, we primarily mixed with Creoles.
Speaker 1: Now, did you--did you--was that easy for you to do or did you think that was okay or, or did you think it was a little bit--
Speaker 2: I don't think we thought about it that much.  It didn't, it didn't make us no difference I don't think.  I mean, I don't think we were any better than other folks, but no worse off because my daddy had--my daddy had a regular steady job, and, and that was one thing that we had that a lot of black folks did not have.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that helped to make you a little special--
Speaker 2: That's right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) 'cause he had a job.
Story_ID: 486014
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Well, I can say the sights were the involvement of, of so-called Creoles with other Creoles rather than with, with black folks, the usual black person.  The fact that, that Daddy [Revius Oliver Ortique, Sr.] had a steady, regular job helped considerably and had a regular, regular income.  How, how he was able to, to buy a house on, on St. Louis Street [New Orleans, Louisiana], which is four blocks from Canal Street, I don't know.  I never, never asked--I don't--
Speaker 1: Well, can- sir, can you describe St. Louis Street for us?  Is it--was it someplace special and how was it special?
Speaker 2: It--well, it, it was a mixed neighborhood, I know that.  It was not, not a very good neighborhood because if you could--if you could afford to, to, to buy a house on St. Louis Street, which was four blocks from Canal Street, you see, you, you bought it if you can afford to pay for it.  I, I don't remember any, any children, playmates or, or teenagers going out together, but I'm sure that that's--that, that was what, what was involved with us, that we, we, we were not--we were not--we're not separated as to the, the black people.  We, we were--we were--we were separated because of economics.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were able to buy this house on St. Louis Street.  We were able to, to attend the, the Catholic church.  Our, our, our parents lived a little bit different, a little bit above other people who happened to be colored.  As a matter of fact, we didn't--we didn't look upon ourselves as, as colored.  We know we weren't--we weren't white, we knew that, but we were--I guess we were a shade above being black.
Story_ID: 486015
Speaker 1: Now, you were born on St. Louis [Street], but you grew up in the 9th Ward [New Orleans, Louisiana], right?
Speaker 2: That's right, right.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about that.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: The 9th Ward was primarily a black ward, made up of black folks.  They were primarily laborers who supported families.  But, my, my [paternal] grandfather, he--I don't know whether he was considered a pipe fitter or a pipe whatever, but my grandfather had a very special job with the Sewerage and Water Board [Sewerage and Water Board of New Orleans, New Orleans, Louisiana], and he, he was--did something special in the laying of, of pipe.  He was able to, to support his children and his family and how, how, how we got from the first grade through the fourth grade, I don't--I don't know.  I don't remember.  But, I do know that I remember when I got to, to the fourth grade, I was at, I was at, at Law Street School [ph.].  And I was at Law Street School for, for several years and then it, it changed from Law Street School to Johnson Lockett School [Johnson C. Lockett Elementary School, New Orleans, Louisiana].  And when it changed, Johnson Lockett School, it was a new, new building, new, new everything, new, new structure.  Everything was new.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But both of those schools are in the 9th Ward, right, in--
Speaker 2: Well, now, it wasn't both.  It was--it was only (unclear) school.
Speaker 1: Oh, one school, okay.
Speaker 2: One school, yeah.
Speaker 1: But it changed names.
Speaker 2: Changed names.
Speaker 1: It went from Law Street School to Johnson Lockett School.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they closed down Law Street School.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Well, what was the 9th Ward like in those days and, and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up in the 9th Ward?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I really can't tell you.  All I know is that the, the, the (unclear) who lived across the street from us and us, our family, we were considered different.  We--our parents worked.  Our, our, our parents supported the families.  We had regular--they had regular jobs.  We were all just different from the rest of the neighborhood.  But, for the most part, we--I know we, we, we stayed in school.  And my, my, my father [Revius Oliver Ortique, Sr.] worked.  My mother [Lillie Long Ortique] worked for, for some white folks, but this was long after things had changed in, in, in the lives of, of black folks, you know.  As I, as I recall, things just weren't the same as when we first moved into this neighborhood.
Story_ID: 486016
Speaker 1: Could you te- tell us about growing up?  I mean, what, what did you like when you were little and what did you like to do?  And who, who were your friends and--?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Well (pause) we, we had large families, so we, we made sure that we, we families knew each other.  That is, you know, my, my aunts and uncles and their, their children.  And especially picked--my, my parents [Lillie Long Ortique and Revius Oliver Ortique, Sr.] I'm sure specially picked who we played with; who we, who we associated with.  We always knew that we were able to get along with certain people and not able to get along with other people.
Speaker 1: Now well who were the, the people that you--that you could get along with and who were the ones who (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Those who had jobs, those who were buying their homes, those who lived at the same level we, we were now living at.  By this time we were just associating with people who had regular work.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that was actually told to you at home.  They, they--your parents taught (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That--
Speaker 1: --taught you?
Speaker 2: --taught us that, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, taught you that.
Speaker 2: Taught us that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so did--when you were at school [Johnson C. Lockett Elementary School, New Orleans, Louisiana], like were there, there different nationalities in school or mostly all, all colored people or black people?
Speaker 2: Mostly all colored people.
Speaker 1: And that would mean the Creoles and black people, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, together.  Any white students in your school growing up (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no whites.
Speaker 1: No--okay.  All right.  Okay.  So, now, did you have a favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: I--if I--if--I'm sure I must have, but I, I just don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because we were--we, we were looked upon as being above a lot of the kids because we, we could all read and write and spell and our parents would make sure that we could read and write and do homework and--
Speaker 1: So this is a--what you're describing I guess is a tradition in New Orleans [Louisiana] and maybe in the rest of Louisiana that, that the Creoles had certain privileges and, and could, could, could do things that, you know--or had access to education in ways that other people didn't perhaps or--I don't know.
Speaker 2: And I don't know whether it was that they had access and that--or they had--I know they had access, but whether it was given to them or whether they took it or--I, I just don't know.  All I know is that we happened to be above or looked upon as being above our other kids in school.
Speaker 1: Well, how did the other kids feel about that?  Did they--did they like that or did they--did they resent it or did they accept it?
Speaker 2: Some, some, some accepted it, some resented it, and some, some looked up to us as being leaders.
Speaker 1: So, did, did you ever get in any trouble in school because of the way people felt about Creoles or--?
Speaker 2: No because no white folks went to the school that, where I went to, you know.  This was all, all colored, all black, all, all c- classes but you had to stay to yourself.  You, you, you more or less stayed to yourself.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you moved up only if you merited moving up and you, you moved up and left other black folks, other black students behind.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I remember we, we were--we were looked upon as being--as being smarter than other kids and we, we moved up and got promoted and--while other kids stayed back.  And they, they didn't seem to object to that.  Their parents didn't seem to object to that either.
Speaker 1: So they more or less accepted their--that position.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Our parents were better educated, more ambitious, worked harder, worked steadily, so forth, and we were buying our own homes.

Speaker 1: Now where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Went to public high school.  Now, I went to Albert Wicker [Albert Wicker High School, New Orleans, Louisiana], which was a, a public high school--
Speaker 1: Okay, Albert (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) preserved for black folks.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, it's what in those days we call a colored school or a--
Speaker 2: Colored school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And--
Speaker 2: And it was--it was--
Speaker 1: Well, how did you do?  Were you a good student in school?
Speaker 2: We, we were all pretty good because we did better than, than most students coming out of, out of grade school and, and because we were looked upon as being better students than the, than the normal student.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I, I wanted to know how you did.  Did you do--I mean, in terms of the, the rest of the students, Creole or black, how did you do?  Did you do better than--I mean, were you like a top student?
Speaker 2: I was among the, the, the top students.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did better than--
Speaker 1: Did you have, did you have one subject that you excelled at better than, than another?
Speaker 2: I excelled in it but it was not, not a regular subject.  I, I was a champion in oratory from starting with the sixth grade and then after I got to the seventh and eighth grade, that was--that was junior high school, I, I continued with that because I, I met a coach who was coaching, who was coaching speech.
Speaker 1: Can you think of their name?  Do, do you know their name now?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Walter J. Barker.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your coach was Walter J. Barker.  Now, did you ever--were you on a, a--on a oratorical team?  I guess you were on a team in school?
Speaker 2: I was on a team but when, when, when, when it came time for the--for the first state championships that were involved in the state, he took me and two other students to the, to the championships.
Speaker 1: Where were they held at?  Were they held in Baton Rouge [Louisiana] or--?
Speaker 2: I think Alexandria [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Alexandria--
Speaker 2: Alexandria.
Speaker 1: --Louisiana.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And when we got to the, to the site of the, of the, of the oratorical contest, he decided he--we could only have one student representative from each school.  He decided he wanted me to represent Albert Wicker School.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I won.
Speaker 1: Okay.  These, these are all the rest of the black schools in the state, or the whole state?
Speaker 2: The rest of the black schools in the state.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  All right.  Well, that was a--now, do you remember what you spoke about?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--you had to--that, that year, Lincoln's [President Abraham Lincoln] Gettysburg Address was, was what you had to know and, and recite and I guess that's the reason why I, I was chosen 'cause I knew it very well.  I'd, I'd known it since sixth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
Story_ID: 486018
Speaker 1: Did you ever serve on a debate team?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Served on the debate team I guess in the ninth grade.
Speaker 1: Now, you know there's a movie now about a debate team called 'The Great Debaters' about Tolson's [Melvin B. Tolson] debate team out at, at Wiley College in Texas [Marshall, Texas], and have you seen that?
Speaker 2: No, I haven't seen that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Yeah, in the movie, they depict James Farmer who became the head of CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] as part of a debate team back in the '30s [1930s], you know.
Speaker 2: That was after my time and, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, did you win any contest in high school [Albert Wicker High School, New Orleans, Louisiana], any debate contest?
Speaker 2: I don't know whether I won in the debate contest, but I know I won consistently the oratorical contest--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at various schools and various cities.  I remember, I'd, I'd take off and go to, go to Baton Rouge [Louisiana] and all the students would be jealous that, that I was selected to go represent the, the school, and it was like, like the kids who were on the basketball team, they represented the school.  Well, I was representing the school on the, on the debating team, or the oratorical team, whatever.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it was really a great pleasure for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you run for any class offices when you were--with those kind of oratorical skills, it seems like they would translate into politics.  Did you, did you run for class office?
Speaker 2: Not that I recall.  I really don't recall.  I, I, I was able to, to--I had a coach and so forth and I was able to, to, to, to go whenever, whenever the professor was, was ready to take me to, to Baton Rouge, Shreveport [Louisiana] and Alexandria [Louisiana], wherever.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you have a favorite teacher in, in, in high school?
Speaker 2: Walter J. Barker.
Speaker 1: Okay, that was your deba- your coach.
Speaker 2: My coach.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Any other favorites?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was a woman teacher, Marie Dejean [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  How do you spell her name?
Speaker 2: M-A-R-I-E, D-E-J-O--J-E-A-N [ph.].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, Dejean, okay.
Speaker 2: Dejean.
Speaker 1: All right.  What, what did she teach?
Speaker 2: Literature.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, you, you were--okay.  You were getting into the world of words and ideas I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I did very well at--in, in junior high school, very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, well, did, did this continue over into high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: But not nearly as active because the, the high school, the principal was not interested in me as a debater because I wasn't a, a very--a big stature.  I wasn't a tall person.  There was a much taller person named Joe Mack [ph.] who he thought should represent the school because he was tall and thin and spoke well, but most folks thought I was a much better speaker than he was, but he never did give me a chance because I, I didn't meet his, his concept of, of build and, and stature, so forth.
Story_ID: 486019
Speaker 1: So, for my, my last year of high school, my mama [Lillie Long Ortique] took me out of that school [Albert Wicker High School, New Orleans, Louisiana] and put me in a school that we were--we, we had to pay.  Now, why she did this, I don't know except for the fact that she, she wanted me to finish from this, this, this high school 'cause she felt I might get a--I might win a scholarship from this high school, whereas with this other school, there wasn't a chance for me to win the scholarship 'cause--
Speaker 2: Now, was the, the, the school a Catholic school?
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was a--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: A, a--
Speaker 2: A private school?
Speaker 1: It was a--hm, what was it?  Episcopal school.
Speaker 2: Oh, Episcopal, okay.  What was the name of it?
Speaker 1: Gaudet, G-A-U-D-E-T.
Speaker 2: Oh, Gaudet, okay.
Speaker 1: Gaudet High School [New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.  So how did you like that school?
Speaker 1: It was all right, but it wasn't anything unusual.  I think I, I won the, I won the scholarship, won, won the scholarship to that school.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Did you--did, did, did you keep your grades up at that school?  Were they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --up?  Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And, and was--because I, I, I, I won a state scholarship--this was in blacks--the black schools, I went on and I got a scholarship to Xavier University [Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 1: And, and lost the scholarship to, to continue at Xavier because I, I made a C in, in, in some course and you weren't permitted to make any grade less than a B even though--even if you had the average 'cause I had all--I, I had an average of B, but I didn't--I made one D and they took the scholarship from me.  And I left--that's when my mama and them took me out of Xavier and put me at Dillard [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana] because it was--it was a, a little bit cheaper to go to Dillard than it was to--
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, so, so did you graduate from high school in '43 [1943], was that it, 1943 or?  No, no.  Okay.  No, no.  When did you graduate from high school?  It was 1940, right?  Was that it?
Speaker 1: Nineteen forty [1940], yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.  All right.  High school, 1940, and so you were at Xavier in 1940, I guess, beginning, then you went to Dillard in '41 [1941]?
Speaker 1: Or '42 [1942] I think it was.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.  Now, Dillard, I know I was talking to you before that the--one of your, your schoolmates was [HistoryMaker] Samella Lewis, the artist, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that was--that was when--after I came back from the [U.S. military] service (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, after you came back from the war [World War II, WWII], okay.  All right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 486020
Speaker 1: So well what happened at Dillard [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana] when you moved to Dillard?
Speaker 2: Nothing particular.  I, I, I was in the, in the school of, in the, in the, in drama department.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not, not specializing.  I didn't--but, I, I went into the drama department because that was where they had scholarships.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were still known as a, a, a good (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Huh?
Speaker 1: You were still known as a good speaker and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, were you--did--were you in any, any plays at Dillard in the drama department?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.  I, I know I did well--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in, in, in drama.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Did--so, now, you were at Dillard--now, you didn't finish up at Dillard.  You were--you were drafted or something (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was drafted.
Speaker 1: Now, now when--
Speaker 2: My third year at Dillard.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, World War II [WWII] is going on now.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And it starts in 1941, the year you go, and so you were drafted.  And was it in nineteen forty-what?  Forty-three [1943]?  Your third year?  Forty-three [1943] or '44 [1944]?
Speaker 2: Or '45 [1945] I think.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1944 or f- '5 [1945], okay.  So, well, what happened?  Now, did, did they--did they have a student deferment then if you were in the school or did--what happened?  How did you get drafted?
Speaker 2: You had a student deferment for a while but then after a while they changed the rules on you and said everybody had to go, and so I was finally drafted in, in nineteen forty--it must've been 1943, I guess.  I know I was a junior when I was finally drafted.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I think--I think that's '44 [1944] if you started in forty (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Might've been '44 [1944].
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you started in '41 [1941], yeah, it's probably '44 [1944] I guess.  But, I mean, you, you know better than I do, but I don't know.
Speaker 2: I don't--I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, well--so, what happened in the [U.S.] Army?  Did they--did they see you as, as officer material right away (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  I, I tell you, I, I--really when I--when I write my book, I'm gonna sure put this in there.  I, I, I decided I just wasn't gonna just be an ordinary person or I wasn't gonna make the ordinary money.  I wanted to be an officer.  Now, here I am just one of--there were only, only a very few whites in my company in the service.  So, one day I decided I'd go see the--go see the, the, the colonel.  And I went to see the colonel and I told him, "I come to see you about going to officer school."  He said, "How the hell did you get in to see me period?"  That's just his very words.  I said, "All I did was ask the lady could I see you.  She said I wasn't--she'd see if you--if you were busy and you weren't busy I could see you."  He said, "Well, get the hell out of my office.  You don't come and see a colonel without an appointment, or without permission or without something."  I said, "I'm sorry," turned around and left.  Well, in a few days, they sent for me.  They--, "Did you apply for officer school?"  I said, "No, I didn't apply for officer school."  "Well, you--something got you going to see the colonel about going to officer school."  So, I went to see the colonel.  He said, "Now this is the way you supposed to do it.  You're supposed to go through the channel."  I said, "Very well."  He says, "You'll hear from me."  Sure enough, within a few weeks, I heard from them.  They were accepting my application for officer school and I went on to officer school.  By that time, they had appointed Thurgood Marshall I think as the first officer or first black officer [sic.].  In any event, I know Thurgood Marshall was an officer by the time I finished officer school.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there were others before you went in, but you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Hm?
Speaker 1: --you know, there, there were other black officers--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --in 1944, plenty.  But--
Speaker 2: But anyhow, I got to be an officer.
Story_ID: 486021
Speaker 1: I think you said they sen- they sent you to Camp Benning, Georgia?
Speaker 2: Fort Benning (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or Fort, Fort Benning?
Speaker 2: Fort Benning, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Fort, Fort Benning, Georgia, okay.
Speaker 2: At infantry school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Infantry school, okay.  And--now, did they, did they keep you on this side of the water or did they send you overseas?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.
Speaker 1: I think your daughter [Rhesa Ortique McDonald] said they sent you to the Philippines?  Did you go to the Philippines?
Speaker 2: Well, I went to the Philippines, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, that's what I mean.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That you--okay.  Well, tell us about that.  Anything happen there that you remember that--of any importance?
Speaker 2: Nothing unusual other than I had to work hard to--
Speaker 1: Now, I know MacArthur [Douglas MacArthur] was over in the Philippines, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: At one time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: He was there with--he was the head of the, the [U.S.] Army in the Philippines.
Speaker 1: Did you ever meet General MacArthur or have any--
Speaker 2: I don't remember.  I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  So, do you remember anything that happened in the Army in the Philippines that, that would be of interest to us?
Speaker 2: If it did, I don't remember it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, how long were you in the Army?  When did you get out?
Speaker 2: Well, I had a tussle with them about me being promoted, and I finally got promoted from a second lieutenant to a first lieutenant.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is that as high as you got?  Did you get any higher than second--than a first lieutenant?  I mean--
Speaker 2: First lieutenant, no.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, that was plenty high 'cause--I mean, I, I got to be a, a company commander.  No, wait a minute, I didn't get to be the company commander in the service.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I forgot.  No, I got to be a first lieutenant, but that was it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So, did you come back in 1946, is that it?
Speaker 2: That sounds (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'Cause that--
Speaker 2: That's--that might be right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause, 'cause I have a note here that you came out of Dillard [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana] in '47 [1947] with a degree in sociology, a bachelor's degree in sociology, is that--is that right?
Speaker 2: That's right.  It'll be two years--it took me two years to get that, that, that degree.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--all right.  So, it could've been 19- well--
Speaker 2: Forty-five [1945].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, no, it would've been--if you were in the--you were in the Army from '44 [1944] until--wait, how many years did you serve in the Army, do you remember?
Speaker 2: Two years.
Speaker 1: Two?  Okay, so then, yeah, you'd, you'd come back around 1946 or '47 [1947].

Speaker 1: Well, tell us about how you met your wife [Miriam Victorianne Ortique] and, and--
Speaker 2: Oh, I had known my wife since, since we had been freshmen together at Xavier [Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: How did you meet?
Speaker 2: How'd we meet?  We were just classmates at Xavier and we, we, we dated in those days and then, then cut it all off and didn't do anything about it for a while and, and started all over again, nothing particular.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, it's gotta be important.  Now, you've been married for--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: You've been married for a long time now.  You're still married and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And a lot of people don't stay married that long, so it must've been pretty special, I guess.  So, so, when did you all get married?  I think it was '47 [1947], right, when you got married, 1947?
Speaker 2: Yeah, '47 [1947], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And you got married in, in--here in New Orleans [Louisiana]?

Speaker 1: We were talking off camera about George Snowden [George W. Snowden], Dr. George Snowden.  Now, he encouraged you to--he taught at Dillard [Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana], and he encouraged you to go to University of Indiana [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana], right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Now, why did he think that was a good place for you?
Speaker 2: 'Cause he figured I could make it and could, could help somebody else to make it and that, that they would be happy to give me a, a scholarship of some kind, which apparently they did.  I, I, I know I didn't pay for--to go to University of Indiana.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, they gave you a scholarship and--now, George Snowden, you said, was a cousin to Frank Snowden [Frank M. Snowden, Jr.], the classicist at (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A cousin, yeah.
Speaker 1: --at Howard University [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: At Howard.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's just for those who want to know, Dr. Frank Snowden, the classicist.  Okay, so George--
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: So, George Snowden encouraged you to go to University of Indiana.  Now, did the--in s- I know in--I've talked to other people who told me that in the southern states, the state would--if you applied to graduate school in that state, they'd often pay for you to go to a northern school 'cause they didn't want you to go to a--they--you know, they, they had segregated schools in the South and they didn't want you in graduate school in a--in a white seg- at LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] or someplace, so they would pay for you to go to Indiana University, University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York], someplace else.  Was that the case here?
Speaker 2: I don't--I just don't know how I got in--who paid for my--but I know I didn't pay for it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, whether I--I, I thought I had--now, I just maybe gave myself too much credit.  I thought I had, had gotten some type of scholarship to go to University of Indiana, but I don't know.  I really don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--oh, the, the--I think your daughter [Rhesa Ortique McDonald] mentioned the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] probably paid for some of it, right?  The G.I. Bill, right.  Okay.  Now--okay.  Yeah.  I got good ears.  All right.  So, you were at--what, what was University of Indiana like in those days?  How did they treat you at the University of Indiana?
Speaker 2: As, as I can recall, treated me very, very well, very well.  There were very few black folks there, particularly in graduate school, particular--even more particularly being in, in government, and everybody wondered what the hell is he gonna do with it, that degree after he gets it, that sort of thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I, I made it and I, I think I took a two-year course there and got my, my master's [degree].
Speaker 1: Were there any special teachers there that took an interest in you that, that you recall?
Speaker 2: Not that I recall.  I just don't recall.
Story_ID: 486024
Speaker 1: Now when you got your master's [degree], you came back to Louisiana.  Now, did you, did you work somewhere first before you went to get your law degree?  I mean, what, what, what did you do between the time that you graduated with a master's from University of Indiana [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] in 1949 to nineteen--I guess to when you started law school?  What did you--
Speaker 2: I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (MIRIAM VICTORIANNE ORTIQUE):  He, he, he was married and I was working.  He, he went to school, Indiana, on the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944].
Speaker 1: Yeah, I--we, we got that part, yeah.  But, what did he do between the time he got his master's degree and started law school?  I mean, what, what was he doing between those--
Speaker 2: (MIRIAM VICTORIANNE ORTIQUE):  He came from Indiana and he was going to get his last year of law school at Southern, Southern University [Southern University Law School; Southern University Law Center] in Baton Rouge [Louisiana] here because he had done three years and he needed one year for the Napoleonic Code, and he was gonna do that last year at Southern. (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, he did--he started law school in Indiana.
Speaker 2: (MIRIAM VICTORIANNE ORTIQUE):  Exactly.
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't know that.
Speaker 2: (MIRIAM VICTORIANNE ORTIQUE):  Yeah.
Speaker 1: I didn't know that either.
Speaker 2: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: I don't remember that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (MIRIAM VICTORIANNE ORTIQUE):  So then when the G.I. Bill ran out, then I was working and he had a job with employment security and because he headed a boycott of, of McDonald Day [McDonald's Day], then they decided that they were not going to give him a promotion, so he quit.  And at the time that he left that employment, that employment that he had, I was working and that's when he decided to go to Southern Law School here in Baton Rouge and get his last year of law school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (MIRIAM VICTORIANNE ORTIQUE):  You got it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, you, you were involved in some kind of a protest in Indiana, is that what you were--
Speaker 1: (MIRIAM VICTORIANNE ORTIQUE):  Not in Indiana.
Speaker 2: Not in--not in Indiana?
Speaker 1: (MIRIAM VICTORIANNE ORTIQUE):  In New Orleans [Louisiana].
Speaker 2: In New Orleans, okay.
Speaker 1: (MIRIAM VICTORIANNE ORTIQUE):  It was the May Day, McDonald Day celebration that they had once a year for all the public schools.  And the reason he was protesting, a guy by the name of Arthur [ph.] (unclear) was organizing this group so that when the black kids arrived, they would have to wait in line until all the white kids went.  And so they--that was the protest, that you arrive and go when you did.  And because he did that and he was working for the state--because he did that and he was working, working for the state, then they told him that he would never get a promotion, so he decided he would quit and use the time to go to law school to get--do the last year.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 1: Thank you, Miriam [Miriam Victorianne Ortique].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: She's right.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, she's right and--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, you, you earned your J.D. degree from Southern University Law Center in 1956.  That's what we have here.  Is that true?  Yeah.
Speaker 1: I think so.
Story_ID: 486025
Speaker 1: You went into private practice, I know that, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you're proud of the fact that you never had to go look for a job anywhere.  You just went, went into private pra- practice.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And, well, why didn't you go look for a job someplace and why, why did you just go right into private practice?
Speaker 2: 'Cause I just felt that I didn't--I, I didn't--number one, I didn't feel like having other, other folks turning me down, you know, just saying, we--I'm sorry, we can't hire you.  I'm sorry we can't hire you.  Just go ahead and took what I can get and I, I, I, I got--I, I rented office space from a, from a drugstore at Orleans [Avenue] and Claiborne [Avenue, New Orleans, Louisiana], and then I finally bought my own building, not that it was much of a building, but it was mine.  And then I eventually had enough money to do complete renovation of that building.
Speaker 1: Now, were there many black lawyers when you got your J.D. degree in '56 [1956]?
Speaker 2: I don't remember, though I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, there was--some of the other graduates of Southern Law School [Southern University Law School; Southern University Law Center, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] that--wait, let me--let me ask you about, do you remember Jesse Stone [Jesse N. Stone]?  He came out before you did.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he came out before I did.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But I remember him.  I knew him quite well as a matter of fact.
Speaker 1: What, what, what was he like?
Speaker 2: Brilliant, tough, and quite a community leader, very proud to know him.
Speaker 1: Now, he became the dean of Southern Law School at, at (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --a certain point, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you were in law school or before you came out of law school, Dutch Morial [Ernest Morial] was at LSU Law School [Louisiana State University Law School; Paul M. Hebert Law Center, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] I think (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) LSU Law School.
Speaker 1: Yeah, was he the first black to come out of that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Did, did you know Ernest "Dutch" Morial?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.  Coming from New Orleans [Louisiana], we knew all the--everybody who finished law school or finished--you know, finished undergraduate school going off to law school or--you know, it wasn't, wasn't hard to know them at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was he like?  Well, he became the first black mayor of New Orleans, but what, what was he like?  What was Dutch Morial like?
Speaker 2: Brilliant, wanted, wanted all of us to succeed, did everything in his power to help us succeed.  He's just, just a fine human being.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I admired him 'cause he didn't have to reach down if he didn't feel like it and yet he reached down and that law office took in several people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What do you mean he reached down?  He reached--what, what do you mean by that, that he reached down?
Speaker 2: He reached, reached into undergraduate school and selected certain people to go to law school and gave them scholarships and things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, he, he helped--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --other people come along and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, do you remember Thomas Todd [HistoryMaker Thomas N. Todd] at--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I didn't get to know him that well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember him doing--I know that he was helpful to a number of people, but I didn't know him that well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Any, any of the other people that, you know, in your--who, who else was a lawyer in New Orleans in those days?
Speaker 2: Well, you had Bob Collins [Robert Collins] and, and, (pause) and of course you had A.P. Tureaud who had been around a long time.
Story_ID: 486026
Speaker 1: So what was your practice like?  What kind of cases did you deal with?
Speaker 2: I went out and I decided I'd go into only civil cases, took no criminal cases at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Except maybe a member of the family or something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, by civil cases, you mean, what, property cases or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Property and lawsuits, people who had gotten injured on the bus.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What do they call those, tort cases or something?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Do they call that tort law or something, the suits against the--
Speaker 2: All I know is civil law.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, is there a difference between civil law and common law--I mean, English common law?  I mean, I was talking to somebody earlier today that said that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The different, difference between common law and civil law, one was based on the civil code and the other was based on the common law.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The civil code is like French--
Speaker 2: French code.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Is there--I mean, is there--does, does it really make a big difference in--
Speaker 2: It, it, it could make a big difference because you had some, some judges that believed strongly in the civil, in the civil code and if you didn't quote the civil code, they, they didn't think that you knew any law.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they--from what I understand, it's a different vocabulary for civil law (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Nods head) But it's not a totally different vocabulary, but there's differences in the vocabulary.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now were you involved in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and the Urban League [Urban League of Greater New Orleans] in those days?
Speaker 2: The Urban League.  I had become president of the Urban League and believed in, in things that the Urban League did and I, I left the, the, the--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the regular common law cases to, to--the common law into the regular civil cases and left the cases that, that fell in the hands of, of NAACP or Urban League, left, left, left them for A.P. Tureaud and that crew and I devoted myself to, to the civil law.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Civil code.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did, did you handle any civil rights ca- I mean, are you saying you left the civil rights cases to Tureaud and, and the other--
Speaker 2: Well, it wasn't a matter of left them, they, they, they ended up with most of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, I did my share.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, can you tell us about some of the civil rights cases that you were involved in?
Speaker 2: Well, (pause) I know I did, did some--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --of this--but, I, I can't think of any at the moment.
Speaker 1: Were, were any involved--were there any like public accommodations cases or, or housing cases or--
Speaker 2: I did some public accommodation cases and I, I did some housing cases.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was very much involved in housing.
Speaker 1: Did you have restrictive covenants here in--
Speaker 2: Louisiana.
Speaker 1: --Louisiana.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Where they, they would specify on the deed that you couldn't sell the house to a black person, that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: And, and some of that.  We had some of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you remember what--I mean, a big victory over that kind of a--did you ever have a big victory over the--
Speaker 2: I don't recall.  I don't recall any.

Speaker 1: In 1966, it says here that President Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] named you to the Federal Hospital Council.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Well, that, that was a very high office, Federal Hospital Council, had, had a lot to do with elimination of discrimination in, in the hospitals and medical schools.  I was particularly interested in the medical schools.
Speaker 1: Oh, I just got a note passed to me to remind you about the Crown--
Speaker 2: Crown Zellerbach [Crown Zellerbach Corporation] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Zellerbach case [Mondy v. Crown Zellerbach Corporation, 1967].
Speaker 2: Crown Zellerbach was a big manufacturing outfit over across the river, over across the lake.  They had two, two very strong unions, one white, one black.  They, they never would get together if they could avoid it.  I used to go over across the river and--not across the river, across the lake and help this black union, give them advice, suggest certain things, do certain actions to take.  White folks found out about it early on.  They, they, they decided, well they were gonna do me in 'cause I had to travel from New Orleans [Louisiana] to Bogalusa [Louisiana] to get to my clients.  Well, one day, I don't know why the Lord told me don't, don't drive my, my Buick, drive my wife's [Miriam Victorianne Ortique] Chevrolet across, across the lake, but that's what I was doing.  And they, they--well, they were waiting in, in, in the woods to do me in.
Speaker 1: So they were waiting (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I safely got back home and, of course, everybody found out about it and, and, and they decided that needn't try that again because we were wise to them on that score 'cause it's just a small group that had decided they were gonna blow up my automobile and they were looking for the Buick and--
Speaker 1: So you--
Speaker 2: --and I was driving the--my wife's Chevrolet.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, just by changing cars, you happened to avoid disaster.
Speaker 2: Avoid getting killed.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  How did you find out that they were gonna get you, you know, afterwards?
Speaker 2: Afterwards I found out.  I mean, the word got around that, that they were, they were so disappointed that they, they were looking for the wrong automobile--
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: --and never dreamed that my wife was gonna be driving.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what happened?  Did, did you continue working with them or--?
Speaker 2: I worked with them until I went on the bench.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now, now, what--about what year did this take place, I mean the Crown Zellerbach case or what years?  Was, was, was this in the '60s [1960s] or--?
Speaker 2: In the '50s [sic.].
Speaker 1: In the '50s [1950s] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Late '50s [1950s].

Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Yes.  And you had a historic meeting with President Lyndon Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson], right?  We, we showed the photo of it I think a little while ago.  Well, tell us what happened at that meeting to, you know, just kind of summarize for us.
Speaker 2: Actually, we had requested the meeting with, with President Johnson because we had no, no federal judges who happened to be black, none.
Speaker 1: Well, no [U.S.] Supreme Court justices, right?  Or is that--
Speaker 2: What is that?
Speaker 1: It was--it was the Supreme Court justices, right, that you needed, right?  Or just--was it federal judges period or Supreme Court justices?
Speaker 2: There wasn't--there wasn't one federal judge.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: And he had--he had said that he would meet with us, I was president at the time.
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: We had no, no federal judges, none (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, let's start again.  We have to start again 'cause we didn't get that part, but you were president of the National Bar Association--
Speaker 1: Bar Association.
Speaker 2: --when the historic meeting took place with President Johnson.
Speaker 1: We asked for a meeting with President Johnson.  He granted us the meeting.
Speaker 2: Now, this is around 1966, I think, right?
Speaker 1: I, I don't remember the date.  Miriam [Miriam Victorianne Ortique] may remember, but I don't remember the date, but I know it was strictly a meeting to discuss with the president the appointment of, of African Americans to the federal bench.  Now--and this is done by the president of the United States.
Speaker 2: Yes sir.
Speaker 1: We get to the meeting, I make the presentation, and I said, "Mr. President, you know, we, we ought to have at least a--at least one African American sitting on the Supreme Court--sitting on the federal bench."  He said, "I agree with you.  Don't we agree, Mr. Marshall [Thurgood Marshall]?"  Judge Marshall was as surprised when he asked him that question as we were 'cause we didn't anticipate that he was gonna ask any questions.  We just thought he was gonna come and listen and promise to, to respond, but he said, "Aren't we, Thurgood?"  Thurgood's answer to, "If you say so, Mr. President."  Within a week, he had named Thurgood Marshall to the federal bench.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So this is--this is 1967 or '8 [1968], right?  I mean, yeah, '67 [1967] or '68 [1968], I guess.
Speaker 1: Some (unclear) somewhere.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause Thurgood Marshall--I, I should have the exact date in front of me, but I don't.  I think it was 1967.  This had to be '67 [1967], yeah.
Speaker 1: Fifty-seven [1957] or '67 [1967]?
Speaker 2: No, '67 [1967], yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sixty-seven [1967], yeah.

Speaker 1: You were asked also by President Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] to serve on the Scranton Commission on campus unrest [President's Commission on Campus Unrest].  Do you, do, do you remember that?
Speaker 2: I remember that.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I remember that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That was when they had the, the--those, those riots on the campus and he appointed me.  I was the only African American he appointed to that commission, to, to the federal commission--

Speaker 2: --which, which, which is nationwide.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had nationwide jurisdiction.

Speaker 2: Board.
Speaker 1: --board, right.  Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you, you served on that board for a long time, right?  You even--
Speaker 2: I, I, I, I really don't know when I went on and when I--when I went off if I ever went off, but--
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause there's a picture of you with Hillary Clinton [Hillary Rodham Clinton] at, at one of the meetings of the Legal Services board--
Speaker 2: Yeah.

Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 486030
Speaker 1: When did you first become a judge?  How did that happen?  Were you elected or appointed or what?
Speaker 2: I was elected judge, but you know I was not the very first judge elected, first African American judge elected in Louisiana.  There were several judges that had been elected before me.  But I was the first judge elected to the state Supreme Court [Louisiana Supreme Court], which was our highest court and therefore had more jurisdiction, had statewide jurisdiction as opposed to local jurisdiction.  Because we had had several judges including Judge Augustine [Israel M. Augustine, Jr.], who was the first judge--who was the first African American appointed judge.  But, I was the first judge appointed to the state Supreme Court, which had statewide jurisdiction.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I think it was--you were appointed--you were elected to the state Supreme Court in 1996 or '7 [1997], right?  That's what your wife [Miriam Victorianne Ortique] was saying (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, no, it was before then.
Speaker 1: Was it before then?
Speaker 2: I don't remember when I was elected, but I know it had to be before then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And you have been the--you have been the New Orlean- you, you have been judge of the Orleans Parish Civil District Court, you've been chief judge of the Orleans Parish Civil District Court, and, you know, before you were elected to the Louisiana Supreme Court.  Oh, okay.  Oh, it's 1992, does that sound better, for the Supreme Court, 1992?
Speaker 2: That sounds- that sounds more like it than, than 1997.
Story_ID: 486031
Speaker 1: You retired from the Louisiana Supreme Court in 1994.  What was it like being on the, the Louisiana Supreme Court?  Was that a- are there any highlights from that experience you want to share with us?
Speaker 2: That was, that was a highlight for me because I was the first African American appointed to that job, but also, it gave me an opportunity to convince others throughout the state that we could do our job and do it quite well and that they could be pleased with the job that we did, and we were satisfied that we convinced many persons connected with the Louisiana Supreme Court that we could do the job that would be asked of us if we got the appointment.  When we did get the appointment, we were able to demonstrate exactly what we had been saying all along, and that was that, give us a chance and we'll make it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we did.
Story_ID: 486032
Speaker 1: In 1999, President Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] a- named you as an alternate to the United Nations General Assembly, right--correct?
Speaker 2: Correct (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And--yeah, now how was that experience?  I mean, what--tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Well that, of course, was a, a very high appointment for, for anyone, black or white, but for an, an African American to be--having been asked to take on that responsibility was really unusual and, and made you feel that you were really first servant in a first class position, which you were.  I never had any regrets and fortunately, I didn't appear to have made any mistakes, and, and the, the, the community was--the legal community was very satisfied with the way that we handled that job.
Story_ID: 486033
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Yeah, if I could, I would probably have, have joined the lower courts earlier so that I could've used influence on the, the lower courts.  And to my great surprise and to, to, to, to, to my liking is the fact that a number of people who happened to be white have said to me on, on more than one occasion, look, we've--we needed you on the court long before now, but now that you've been on this court, you've laid your--you've made your mark here.  Be sure to make, make other people understand that you are the--you are making your mark not, not for you so much as for those who are gonna come after you, and that to me was the important thing.
Story_ID: 486034
Speaker 1: When you look back over all of your accomplishments and I know you've received the Martin Luther King Lifetime Achievement Award presented by Loyola [Loyola University New Orleans, New Orleans, Louisiana], Tulane [Tulane University, New Orleans, Louisiana] and Xavier [Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana], and there's a lecture series named for you at Southern University Law School [Southern University Law Center, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], a lot of other honors, you know, both national and local.  When you look back over your life, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: (Pause) I would consider opening, opening doors to be my legacy, to, to let people know that you don't have to accept what, what is dictated by the status quo, but rather you can say I want to--not only do I want to serve in this capacity, I want to change it so that others can serve in this capacity.
Story_ID: 486035
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns, sir, for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, there's no question in my mind that my number one hope and concern has to do with persons being able to serve not because they're African American but because they're fully qualified, that's my number one concern.
Story_ID: 486036
Speaker 1: We are now in the throes of a, a, a political contest for president.  We've got our first African American candi- serious candidate for president.  How do you feel about that?
Speaker 2: I feel that it's gonna happen and it needs to happen and I'll be happy for it to happen.  Why didn't you ask me, why is it you came out for the, the woman [Hillary Rodham Clinton]?  I came out for the woman because it was important for someone to come out for the woman at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, well I didn't know, so I didn't know to ask you, but, but (laughter), feel free to answer it (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But I just wanted to let, let the public know that it was important for us to have a strong capable voice speaking on behalf of some person other than our candidate for, for the presidency.  But now that I've made that announcement, I've made the announcement that I will be supporting a, a candidate for president and it will not be--unfortunately for her, it will not be the, the lady candidate, but rather for Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama].
Speaker 1: Oh, Barack Obama, this--
Speaker 2: Yeah.

Speaker 1: Is there anything else that I need to ask you before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No, please ask the last question.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And you had some advice for the organization I think before you sat down to do this session.  What, what was your advice?
Speaker 2: My advice is get in as many leadership positions as you can, as often as you can, and serve as well as you can.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's my advice.
Speaker 1: And, well, my last question is similar to legacy but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: (Pause) I don't know.  I'm not quite sure.  I don't know how well I should be remembered, or should not be remembered or whatever.  But all I know is that I've tried to do my very best and I hope that someone will remember that I remembered them.
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, thank you very much, sir, for your time.
Speaker 2: You're, you're quite welcome.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Quite welcome.
