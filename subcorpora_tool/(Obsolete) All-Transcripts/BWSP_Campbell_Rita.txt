Derria Byrd: This is Derria Byrd interviewing Rita Campbell '75, October 26,
1995. Okay, we're going to start with some background information and a
little bit about your family history.
Rita Campbell: I am originally from Washington, DC; that's where I grew
up. My parents were both born in Washington and their parents were from
small cities in Virginia. Their families moved into the Washington area in
order to take advantage of the new work opportunities available to blacks
during that period; so there was a lot of migration into the Washington, DC
area. I went to an all-black public high ... well, elementary and junior high
schools in the northeast Washington, DC area called Brookland and Michigan
Park. I really enjoyed those experiences and found that I really excelled and I
was more of an extrovert. I found that as I was in elementary and junior high
schools and then when I went to an all-white Catholic girls' high school, I felt
a pressure to exceed academically but I was not involved in as a many (pause)
hmmm, well I was involved in extracurricular activities but I did not
promote myself as much in the same way as I did when I was in an all-black
environment. I think I was just trying to make sure that I excelled
academically and I think the social groove just wasn't there for me. (pause)
Anything else in terms of that? I could go on and on about Washington. Did
you move in to . ..
DB: What specifically brought you to Brown?
RC: I was in a school that was very intense academically; it was Ursuline
Academy in Bethesda, Maryland. And there were two black seniors. I can't
remember how many students the class had in it. It was close to 600. But I
can't remember the class size right now, but nonetheless, I really pushed
myself. I was in advanced calculus and advanced physics a year ahead of what
I should have been--a year and in another case, two years ahead. And when it
came to the period when we were encouraged to apply to colleges, we weren't
really encouraged to apply to challenging colleges. That school had had a
history of women going to a college--I think it was in Dayton, Ohio--but it was
really kind of a relatively little-known place, but most of the women were
expected to go to college and then get married. And really not have any career
expectations. I chose to apply to the University of Pennsylvania, Chatham
College, and Brown University and Georgetown University. And I chose
Brown out of .. . actually Brown came to mind because my brother, who is
nine years my senior, had a very close friend who was in the architecture and
engineering department with him at Howard and his sister went to Brown,
Ido Rice. Her maiden name was Judith Fitzhugh. And she ended up

Campbell 2

majoring in psychology here; she got her Ph.D. from Brown. And she told
me to look very seriously at Brown and during that period in my life, I really
wasn't caught up in the prestige of going into an Ivy League School. I really
had not bought into a lot of that. I was really just kind of critical of a lot of
those kinds of values during that period. And in addition to that, Brown
wasn't a very well-known Ivy League school and I didn't realize the import,
actually, of going to an Ivy League School and how long it does take to change
(laughs) a society's values. And we were coming up during what were
considered revolutionary times and we were trying to be iconoclasts about a
lot of things. There were all kinds of debutante affairs and rites of passage
that I felt reluctant to participate in. Some I participated in grudgingly and
others I somehow managed not to because I felt that they represented
attitudes and a society that I wanted to change. But nonetheless (laughs), the
idea of not going to school--not going to college--was not in my thinking
because my parents and their siblings had all gone to college so it was really
expected of me. And I looked forward to it and chose Brown and there were
some other influences. There was a young man I was involved with that I
felt I needed to get away from (RC & DB laugh) and we had been together for
like four years--four or five years--which is a really long time for a young
person but it really had a lot to do with the fact that I was at a girls' high
school and I wasn't exposed to a lot of events and options with other guys.
Had I gone to Coolidge or Roosevelt, I might have been less monogamous but
his thinking was a little warped. And I didn't have the faculties to really be as
critical as I should have been about that relationship. But nonetheless, I
finally got a grip and since I got accepted to Brown, there was another
motivation to get out of town as well. I applied to the schools in the
Pennsylvania area because my brother had gone to architectural school for his
masters at Carnegie Mellon and so I looked in his area, as well. But I chose
Brown .
DB:
When you arrived, how similar or dissimilar was the Brown
atmosphere to what you had experienced in high school and was the
transition difficul t for you?
RC: I didn't find the transition difficult. I was comfortable with being in an
all-white environment but actually, yea, in retrospect, I realize that I was
probably giving people the benefit of the doubt where they shouldn't have
had the benefit of the doubt. Just thinking back to the high school experience,
my chemistry teacher had asked that interested people apply for research
assistant's positions at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and I filled out
what was somewhat of a lengthy application and turned it in on time and had
my parents review it and they're very very critical people. They were both
educators . .. my father a superintendent with the DC public school system,
and my mother a school teacher for years. So the application was very tight
and it turned out that when we inquired about the status of my application,
my chemistry teacher said she had lost it. And see, I was very very upset

Campbell 3

about it but I didn't think of the motivation behind it because back then we
weren't making copies. That was before copying machines were de rigeur , so
it really didn't occur to me that this was a racist act. And wouldn't you
characterize the last name of Koegle as possibly a German last name? K-o-e-g­
e-r or -I-e. And my parents, I think, were giving people the benefit of the
doubt, too, and didn't challenge that. So my consciousness, I think took a
little while--I was so used to being in a black environment that you get used
to trusting people and accepting things face-value rather than looking for
racost-based hidden agendas. So I think that experience as well as some other
similar experiences, I started to gain a suspicion (laughs) that we all need to
cultivate, especially in light of the Mark Fuhrmans that still existed. Just to be
on guard and be cautious so that we can just define our direction and
challenge people that need to be challenged who may be trying to undermine
our best intentions. Anyway, corning to Brown was comfortable and there
seemed to be a really quick gelling of groups by ethnic boundaries. And I saw
that as well in high school, but because of the ratio, we did not do the... we
did not have the same kind of dynamic--there would be a lot more cross­
cultural seating that I found at Brown, in the cafeteria, for instance. Does that
still happen now with the cafeteria? It's pretty much the ethnic separation?
DB: (nods) There is even a segment that is called Little Africa?
RC: Oh yea? Oh wow! (laughs)
DB: It's still there.
RC: Yea, so that's something that I felt (pause) I felt kind of unhappy about in
some ways because--and good about it in other ways--unhappy because I was
hoping that things would have evolved to a higher place in terms of
interacting in a more homogenous--is that the right word? Heterogeneous?
Would it be homogenous or heterogeneous?
DB: It would be the second.
RC: It would be the second, right. And the same thing happened with
relationships as you would expect. I had an interest in a couple of white guys
that pursued me for a date and I went out on a couple of dates on a couple of
instances and, in those situations, I felt really uncomfortable because I felt like
there was a lot of scrutiny and I felt that people were into ostracizing. Black
females as well as black males were viewing any interracial fraternization
traitorous. And I really, I guess, did not have the emotional strength to just
feel comfortable about whatever it was I felt like doing. And I kind of
succumbed to the social pressures for what I believed in and maybe I didn't
even make it clear--I can't even remember whether I made it clear that I
didn't want to pursue the relationships because I felt pressure. But
nonetheless, those relationships kind of fell apart really quickly. I mean, the

Campbell 4

interest was expressed and then--1 don't know--it may have lasted maybe two
or three weeks or whatever. But, let's see.
DB: So what were you expecting from Brown besides ...
RC: I expected to be challenged. I expected the coursework to be pretty
rigorous and I was really smart in being very assertive about taking a lot of
courses on freshman and sophomore years and that insecurity worked in my
favor towards my junior and senior years because I was getting very
contentious with some ... a couple of professors . . . I mean that buffer zone
that I had created for myself really (laughs) worked to my advantage just
because I found myself in many situations where I didn't like the relationship
with the professor or I didn't like the value system that was promoted. But
whatever it was, I ended up not getting that course on my record as a (laughs)
"Pass" so it was just lucky that I had done all that extra work out of insecurity.
So hmm I was pretty open about Brown. And 1--1 don't know--1 feel like
there were a lot of resources available that I was not aware of and I didn't not
take advantage of them. But in retrospect, I wish I had it all to do over again
because both academically and (pause)--I don't know I can't even really
divorce it from--social issues. I see so many ways where I might have--had I
been able to really get a grip on my intere'st--1 could have really defined
something and raised money for myself to have a very independent lifestyle
by the time I got through school or by the time I finished with graduate
school. Bu t that kind of thinking really had not evol ved during that time
and I suppose I can't expect the instructor or leaders in my environment to
share something with me that they generally had not considered or
participated in. But I found myself in the anthropology department because I
have an attraction for--an affinity to--ecology or psychology and
ethnomusicology and art and music and dance of the cultures of the world.
And I could really have defined a lifestyle for myself that was independent
and that supported my interest in documentary video and photography. I
was turned on by Levi Riefenstahl's work and I was disappointed that a
German woman had done such fabulous work on the African people. And I
wanted to kind of pursue that and expand on what she had already done. She
had a controversial history, too . I don't know whether you know. She was
involved with Hitler (laughs) and with--actually, she was involved with him
in--some kind of intimate relationship--and she I think wanted to promote
that she wasn't thrilled with his thinking at all. But, nonetheless, once
people found out that she was involved with him, they exiled or ostracized
her from this country. But, nonetheless, she went on to do some really
interesting books. Big (gestures) coffee table tomes . Anyway, (pause) you
know with my skills in writing and with my interest I could have really
designed some directions in study that would have taken me to some really
interesting places. But I did not establish the kind of rapport that I need with
the people who were really working in that area intensely. And I had access
to--or I had my own 35mm equipment and then I had access to--Rites and

Campbell 5

Reason's video equipment. And I did do my thesis on eastern philosophies
and religions and I did a lot of research and taping with the Zen Center--that
was a local group ... which had a very cross-cui tural following and they were
right down on Wickenden and Hope Street at that time. So I was practicing
meditation. I was integrating my interest in that philosophy with what I was
doing in my coursework and had I had the right dialogue going on, I probably
would have not left Brown without a real strong direction and sense that I
could raise money to support my studies and research and go on to do it more
intensely.
DB: What are the things you remember most fondly about your years at
Brown?
RC: (pause) I really enjoyed the comraderie that I established with a group of
women friends . And I really enjoyed the parties that we had over at the
Pembroke Field House--you know it was a time to dance and hang out. I
enjoyed the athletics that I was involved with. I enjoyed applying myself and
finding out [that] I really could achieve things academically. I just could have
gone a lot farther than I did had I been I think more assertive. I think I have a
strange combination of like arrogance and insecurity . It was one of those
things that kind of ... a quality that I think a lot of people have ... You need
to know something and you have to feel comfortable about whatever
direction it is you're taking and unless somebody is there to really articulate
some things for you, you don't find out until it's in retrospect. I really
enjoyed the curriculum. I liked the fact that it was a very progressive
direction with how to deal with student help and trying to encourage people
to try different things but I didn't take . . . there was another situation in
which I didn't take as seriously as I might have with another frame of mind
because I felt like, "Oh, my parents are paying for me to get through school.
I'm not going to mess around and take something that is too much of a
challenge because if I fail then I'll have to go back and do it again and they
won't be very happy with me." So, I mean, there were those kinds of
pressures that kind of ruled people's thinking and it's really unfortunate
because you end up not having the happiest learning experience or the most
fulfilling learning experience because it is really ruled by economics in a lot of
ways. And I guess that won't change in society for many years to come,
especially in light of that fact that the administration is getting so
conservative now, they are probably cutting back educational support so it is
going to be even more difficult for people to feel more free in the learning
experience. But (pause) I don't know; I could say a lot more (laughs) about
that but . .. other things that I enjoyed ... I think the social life was pretty
good but I also thought that the admission's department was kind of biased.
They had a lot of great women, and all the guys were--I don't know. All the
guys seemed shorter than I was. I don't know, there was some weird kind of
thing going on and it just seemed like some kind of pattern. I really didn't
meet anybody--until I guess junior year--that I really got interested in and I

Campbell 6

think I approached that relationship from kind of a dysfunctional place
anyway because I was coming out of a lot of conditioning and a lot of
influences that I didn't even recognize in my adolescence but [which]
governed how I conducted myself. I did things like: I could have graduated
Magna Cum Laude had I not done his work for him (laughs), too. You know
it was like, "Oh I can't get along with the professor and ... " I just put a lot of
effort into my own academics but I really helped him more than I should
have. And that was a failing on my part but that was something that was a
problem with me that I really didn't recognize until long after having
graduated college. But you know one thing I can say is that Brown did give
me the courage: for one thing, to look at myself and see where things were
dichotomous and see where I needed to work on myself and recognize that I
have this value system that I am working on and it is sometimes inconsistent
so let me try to gain the strength to pull everything into focus and have
continuity that makes some kind of sense. And it was just you know. .. I
really think that just what I had been through at Brown helped me to be
resourceful about myself and opinions in those ways. And recognize where I
needed work and pull things together and relate how I might have been
treated as a child and adolescent and how that has shaped me and just how
they both help me to identify what I want to keep and what I want to get rid
of. And just recognizing that a lot of those things that we are as a matter of
parental influences and societal influences are things that even they are not
cognizant of the flaws . . . I think our parents have something that they
inherited and a lot of those ways that they were communicating with us
weren't entirely enlightened and evolved ways of thinking. We have to just
recognize that--and not blame them--because those are things that they may
or may not see as problematic but as long as you can have the resources to
recognize it, then I think that it is a posi ti ve outcome. Then again, I think a
lot of the critical thinking that I have developed really came out of having the
time and space to come to Brown and to get really you know literate and
sharpened skills of critical analysis ... what else do I want--I guess we can
move on actually. There are some other things that will probably come up
later.
DB: What do you consider the low points in your Brown career or things that
you would like to change if you could?
RC: Low points. r don't want to ramble. I see that it's 1:25; you said that you
had to get out of here at 2:30. You have to leave at 2:30 and there are a lot of
questions, so I'll try to be more brief ... Well the low points really were ...
there were two academic low points. (pause) As I said before, I did really
really well in advanced calculus and physics, but then when I came here I did
a really sad thing: I choked . . . First I was attracted to foreign languages and
then I was attracted to being pre-med and I took some of the pre-med courses.
And, then, a calculus course. I could have done really well and, in fact, I did
not choose to ask for help when I needed help and this goes back to that

Campbell 7

arrogance I mentioned before where I could just sit back and think, "Well, I
can do this on my own." And not recognizing that I needed to get help and
then I did not pass the final exam and turns out--I found out that--I missed it
by 1 question which would have given me what I needed to pass the exam
and all of that grew out of an insecurity about that fact that everybody seemed
to know all the answers. And I did not want to be the one that didn't know,
but once I consulted with the professor afterward, it turned out a lot of people
had taken that course two and three times and they knew the answers. And
so what I thought was reality was just all wrong. I had really misinterpreted
the situation and because of that arrogance or whatever it was that wouldn't
allow me to ask questions had caused me to fail. So you know ...
[End Side 1, Tape 1]
RC: Well, all right, another low point was when I took a course in eastern
religions and philosophies from this woman from Harvard and there were
four or five people who could not get along with whatever her philosophy
was--it was just really difficult for a number of us to process and it really
saddened me because that was the course--a course--that I was really truly
interested in and to have someone that I . . . found really difficult to
communicate with made me very unhappy. And I think I'll drop that course
and move on but that was one of those situations in my junior or senior year
and I was glad I took a lot of extra courses. And also when the guy that I was
dating decided to drop me (laughs) my junior year that really depressed me to
the point that I got physically sick and it turns out that since that time he's
been coming back to the reunions and calling me up and also just over the
years checking to see if I might be interested in him again. I mean, after 20
years, it's the weirdest thing. So he's dysfunctional; I was definitely
dysfunctional. But one thing that was interesting that relates to that is the fact
that a woman did take an interest in me who was my French instructor,
Margo Kasden, who during that period was a really intense feminist and she
got me to go out to some consciousness-raising groups so I heard what she
was saying or I listened to what she was saying but I didn't hear her. Because
she was saying to me that I had too much invested in men and relationships
with men. Whatever it was she said to me, I just could not translate into
how I conducted myself. In fact, I needed more assistance; I needed more
counseling bu t I didn't look at it as needing counseling. As a matter-of-fact, I
was really suspicious of counseling back then. But anyway. So a lot of what
was giving me a hard time I think might have been helped had I gotten a
little deeper into that relationship with her. You see at that point, I wasn't
willing to work with her. You know how you can talk until you are blue in
the face with some people and try to say, "This is the wrong way to do it." or
don't think like that because you are wasting your time." and they can listen
but they can't hear you until they go through situations that kind of teach
them that lesson . So it's really difficul t because you know you can kind of
look back and say, "Well somebody could have told me that and I would have

Campbell 8

known how to conduct myself with my life." or "I would have known better
than to go down that path." but you can't really say whether you'll be ready to
receive that advice. So .. .
DB: How were your strongest friendships developed and were your friends
from a variety of backgrounds in terms of geography, class, race?
RC: Most of my inner circle were all African American females who were
from Mid-Atlantic states--Baltimore, New York. Some were from California,
I guess. Cleveland. I mean, not Cleveland, Detroit. And I did have one good
friend who was a roommate my freshman year and 1 talked to her in the
pretty recent past. I tracked her down; she's getting her masters in fine arts.
Toward the end of the year, she must have had it real tough ... she was
always hung up on body image stuff because of the "freshman fifteen;" and, 1
just always had a propensity to gain weight and so did she. Turns out she
ended up with a really bad case of anorexia and I saw her the last year and she
looked like an absolute ghost. Just very very very bony and so she ended up
getting a grip on that before killing herself. I don't know. All that stuff's a
function of absorbing the wrong values from the media and you know, I
guess we were living out a lot of the things. ; . I smoked during, I guess that
was ... let's see, I think I started when I was a sophomore and it took me a
few years to get out of it. Maybe seven years to get out of it. It was really a bad
thing. Something that I saw--maybe I saw it as glamorous--I don't know what
it was but it was just really an unenlightened thing to do. I would work out
and clean out my system and then debauch it. (laughs) And even my
consumption of alcohol during that period was really probably a function of
vestiges from the way that I was treated as a child and adolescent in the home.
Things like that you just do not recognize. I thought that 1 would always be
struggling with a depression, you know. And in retrospect, 1 realized that the
alcohol 1 might have consumed on Saturday still had an effect on me by
Thursday because it makes your cerebellum convulse and it has all these kind
of delayed reactions in your system. But a lot of people us didn't recognize
ourselves as really uninformed, unwise consumers. At this age I am a real
health-nut and I have been taking lots of anti-aging, free-radical cleansers and
watching what I eat. Nearly for seven years I never even touched any alcohol
or chocolate or cigarettes or anything to alter my state. It turned out that I
found out that you could alter your state--have a mind-altering effect just by
experimenting with some of the interesting herbs out here in the market that
people aren't really well-aware of. Gingho Biloba is an herb that really
stimulates brain function and had I known about it and had I experienced the
clarity and the sharpness as a young person in school, it would have been a
great supplement just for study and taking exams and memory. I could have
really used it during college. But we were into the negative end of the
spectrum of (laughs) substances, I think, at point. Well, a percentage. There
were, I'm sure, the ratio you might find to be--the ratio of people who

Campbell 9

indulged in cigarettes and alcohol, etc. probably would be similar across the
board if you were to compare colleges. But ...
DB: How would you say your career at Brown was affected by being an
African American and a woman, specifically?
RC: Oh, something just came to mind that relates to what you had asked
before. I had a faculty advisor and we were supposed to choose a direction for
our thesis and I proposed something that related to the paranormal and
Carlos Casteneda's teaching and, as usual with me something really off the
beaten path and he tells me that, "Oh that's not something that I have much
background in so why don't you change your direction." And as a consumer,
I should have said, "MaybeI should change my faculty advisor" or find some
way to really be adamant about what it was I had an interest in. It all had to
do with consciousness and, at that age, I just went on and accepted what he
said because I bought into authority, I guess, on a level that I wouldn't at this
point. And that a lot of students today would not. And I probably challenged
more things than my parents did and you guys challenge more things than
we did and so it's just all in the process of society becoming--well, evolving
and becoming--more and more civilized as people. How to push the
envelope and try to really recognize what it is that they want and go after it. I
guess that kind of relates--I don't know that could kind of fall into the low
point category in a way because I capitulated to this person's interests when
it's my family that's paying for me to get from this school something that
makes sense for me. And, at that point, maybe I should have gone to Duke
University where they take the paranormal really seriously. That he didn't
have a real kind of enlightened conversation for me, that was the conclusion.
And another interesting low point is when I had bouts with insomnia. And I
ended up going to--I had a visit with a psychiatrist; and, the guy, rather than
saying to me, "Well, maybe you may need some counseling and we need to
talk about what's disturbing your sleep," he just prescribed some drugs for me
to take. And, I take it like a dummy. (laughs) Of course, even with the birth
control issue, back then Dr. Evrard was the ruler of roost over there at ObGyn
and they had just come out with a pill and it was just too high of a dosage of, I
guess estrogen. We'd take things and not be really critical of things and I had
really really bad reactions and--I can't recall ... but anyway ... Of course the
bad reactions that women during that period had put them in a situation
where they really had to really make adjustments quickly during that period.
Boy, did that get me in trouble with my mother because the bad reaction I had
happened when I went home for a break (laughs). Talk about busted.
(laughs) Bad, bad timing. I had something called Erythema nodosum, which
is a thromboid kind of reaction; a blood-clotting reaction and I had just driven
home to Washington and I guess just being seated all that time created these
huge swellings on my legs and I said, "What is this? What is this?!" And we
rushed to the hospital as soon as I got into Washington and, with my mother
standing there, "Are you one the Pill?" (laughs) So ...

Campbell 10

DB: The cat was out of the bag.
RC: It was crazy. And that was right at that wave when it was really
controversial about whether college students should be taking the Pill and
parents should be concerned because they are starting to have co-ed dorms. It
was just really intense. (laughs) So what's that: a low point or high point?
(laughs) A quandry point. Oh boy. And you asked me ... what was your last
question?
DB: About how your career was affected by being an African American at
Brown and, specifically, an African American woman.
RC: I think having gone to Brown legitimizes me in other people's eyes as
having a certain level of capacity intellectually and people seem to have more
immediate respect for my having taken on a certain level of academic
challenges and dealt with them. But since I chose a path that took me
through arts management and theater and other kinds--theater, dance, other
kinds of fine arts-related kinds of directions I have had a pretty difficult -time,
I think, finding a place that's really comfortable; and, then I think where I
may have been in situations that were influenced because I was African
American that I did not recognize. But the stuff that I did recognize most
clearly had more to do with sexism than anything else. There were, I think,
lots of opportunities that could have been real opportunities that turned into
dust and nothingness because men had hidden agendas and then when it
turned out that those agendas were revealed and I wasn't interested, then the
whole opportunity went down the drain. So, in a sense, maybe they felt like
an African American woman would be more cooperative with their interests.
I don't know. You know you can't tell what the proportions are African
American--I mean racism versus sexism because it's all kind of mixed in. So,
I mean; I could itemize a whole lot of si tua tions wi thin this talent agency
which I have had over the past 12 years where really really important
decision-making on the national scene perpetrated really sexist things. I
mean, but it's just been a problem really straight through (pause) young
adolescence straight through adulthood and it's really a sad situation. And
both the racism and the sexism which operate in society--both of those issues
are really important to me and need to be addressed as often as possible
because apparently we're not making much progress. (laughs) I mean, it
doesn't seem like it. In a lot of ways, a lot of the progress seems superficial
but at least the conversations are going on and if we keep it in the forefront,
we can make better strides with the Packwoods and the Ben Chavises; and,
you know, the sad part is when you think you're dealing with people with
the same culture, same race, same heritage and they turn out to perpetrate
some sexist thing, right. You have the racist thing coming from white males
and white females and then you have the sexism thing coming from within
your own culture and it's just like headaches . (laughs)

Campbell 11

DB: What do you do?
RC: Yea, I know. So I think that I could have made a lot more progress
economically had I cooperated with a lot of "things" that I needed to do.
(laughs) I don't even know if that's true. It could, you know, it could have
been--that those situations could have turned to nothing as well. I could
have cooperated with "it" and been entirely dysfunctional across the board,
who knows. Or it could have been legit and I could be making as much
money as the guys or something. (laughs) Or, you know, it's difficult to tell
but I feel lucky, again, and not to be redundant, but just to have enough
critical thought going on so that I really began to define my boundaries more
and more clearly as I got more involved in trying to make a living for myself.
And I think that has to say something positive ... but I don't know, I might
have done better at Howard, you know. Because I definitely think I was far
more expansive when I was in an all-black environment than when I was in
a white environment. And it's interesting. I think some study needs to be
done. Probably has been done.
DB: I think there have been studies that actually have shown that blacks do
better at [historically black] schools. It may be because of the support that goes
on there and issues that you have to deal with at [predominantly] white
schools that you wouldn't have to deal with at white schools that you
wouldn't have to deal with at black schools.
RC: And the same thing with choking when I got here. With all of the
intensity that I prided myself on when I was in high school, I just got
insecure. I choked when I got here and just went into more literary pursuits,
you know, just didn't have the support to stick with pre-med. I mean it's
hard for those resources to exist where you get the kind of counseling on a
one-to-one basis, you know. And you have to know that you need it, which I
didn't. (laughs) I'm not sure I thought I needed it then.
DB: What do you think Brown tried to or actually taught you about the role
of women in society?
RC: Women's studies were just starting to gain ground and . . . sex
discrimination was a really big issue back then. There were a lot of things said
on the forefront of people's minds about women in society and I really felt
like I wanted to find a real independent path for myself. I really wanted to be
self-sufficient. I wanted to define--actually, I wanted all those things but I
really wasn't living up to those aspirations in a way that I should have. It's
just like I said, before I intellectually had a grasp of where women should go I
kind of practiced that for myself and I tried to do some very independent
things with my liJe. I went to Brown for four years, with Rites and Reasons
and theater management for two years because I had an attraction to arts

Campbell 12

management. And then I went to a Harvard publishing procedures course
thinking that I might want to go to New York and be in the publishing
industry. And then I thought I could create something for myself. And just
to kind of get stabilized, I kind of got started working for the state doing fund
development work and grant administration for a human services agency.
And I began working with several women's projects--like single parents of
domestic violence victims as well as developing monies for arts in the
prisons and theater and arts in the human services agencies in order to just
get people involved in the community so that they might understand the
different directions that they might pursue. And after that I developed my
own business, in collaboration, with a partner. So, in a sense, I had
aspirations to do really independent things but also everything is just very,
very interdependent and symbiotic and you can't ever really get away from
that. And I think in light of all the psychological burdens that I was still
trying to process, I did a critical job and I think Brown taught me to be critical
of my place as a woman in this society. And I think it related to what I was
talking to you about earlier: that it's all kind of a work in progress because a
lot of the stuff that I was thinking and talking then really didn't really wind
up becoming reality because there are so many things that we are conditioned
to and so many ways that I was conditioned as a woman to relate to society-­
filled with expectations that I am still struggling with. I mean just that body
image stuff is a real drag. Everyday I look in the mirror and say, "God, eight
pounds." (laughs) It's like a self-flagellation thing. I mean, everyday, I have
been working out for years and it's like, "Well, I have to deprive myself on
some other level in order to get where I kind of find this little ideal and that
little ideal really is that image that the media has programmed into me and
then I say to myself, "Oh, don't worry about it. You're fine. I mean you're 42.
What the hell?! (laughs) It's all just there now; there's nothing you can do
about it. You got that "Freshman Fifteen" at Brown and haven't been able to
get rid of it." But at least it keeps the battle raging. I haven't given up and
settled on a low-road . I try to fluctuate between the middle-road to the high­
road. And I try to take the high-road and come to the wider concl usions for
myself as a woman relating this society. And [I] try to be comfortable in my
own skin . In fact, I think that is a function of critical thinking, you know. I
could have learned that at Howard. (laughs) Might have had a Ph.D. by now.
(laughs)
DB: How influential would you say your classroom expenences were on
what you decided to do after graduation?
[End Tape 1, Side 2]
DB : I'll just ask the last question again . How influential would you say your
classroom experiences were on what you decided to do after graduation?

Campbell 13

RC: Well, I ... God, I was taking French classes. I was taking some physics,
pre-med, lots of anthropology courses, lots of religious studies courses, which
I absolutely loved. Lots of philosophy of art courses, which I loved. And
(pause) the courses had really allowed me to articulate my feelings about the
circumstances I find myself in as a consumer, as a participant in the society
either as an employee or as an employer, with my own business. So I feel like
the classroom experiences, in terms of setting a real broad understanding of
how interdisciplinary everything is and how ... I don't know ... how you
can just be resourceful in solving problems. I mean, I think that most of the
professors I had ... instructors I had ... really had something important to
share.
I feel what was missing was the guidance to really design
independence for yourself. And I feel like that was missing because they
really didn't know, you know, in a lot of cases, because they were trying to
participate in an academic institution for their economic stability and I
realized, oh God, I have just a problem when it comes to dealing with higher­
ups in a lot of organizations because when I see how a lot of people think and
I see the flaws in how people think, I want to challenge it but the way that
society is set up, the challenges aren't absorbed very well. (laughs) And most
of these organizations want to just continue on with the status quo and don't
want to make--aahh, they don't want to make changes. You know, it's like
trying to teach an old dog new tricks. From one respect, it's made me--my
classrooms experiences and I guess from all that, the critical thinking--has
made it kind of difficul t for me to find a place. And I think ignorance can be
bliss in a lot of cases because you see a lot of adults tolerating a lot of crap and
just taking whatever the order is coming down from authoritarian ... the
ranks of (pause) the people that govern without any question. And I just do
not fit in very well (laughs) in situations like that. So I end up expressing
myself, and then either you know things change in those si tua tions--things
that could change--or I would just leave out of discontent. I don't know if
that was specifically ... you want to get into something else with regard to
that question or is that where you wanted to go with that?
DB: Kind of, yes.
RC: Yea, I took--the next one has to do wi th some courses on black issues-­
and I took some urban studies courses and I took the course wi th Barry
Beckham on black authors and black literature. And lots of [anthropology]
courses on African societal structures and community development and what
I found is very interesting: I found that a lot of the black professors--the male
black professors--were out to really prove that they had it all together-so
together that they were kind of difficult to communicate with. And I don't
know if that propensity is still here but I have noticed how a lot of the
professors that I knew then are far more open now than they were then and
far more down-to-earth and comfortable to be with. They were such intense
taskmasters back then that and just almost militaristic with their attitudes
about what they were teaching that they were hard to feel comfortable with,

Campbell 14

you know. It was almost like they were into a black authoritarian [mindsetl.
"You cannot find anything wrong with me and if you dare, you'll get cut to
bits." Michael Harper; Barry Beckham. Michael Harper is so easy to be with
now and I think it's because they established themselves in tenure and it was
not longer a question of whether they were valued ... that over-achievement
thing that a lot of us feel--like I felt like at an all-white Catholic girls school, "I
really have to have my academics together here because I don't want them
calling me stupid." So, it was over-achievement out of a dysfunctional
mindset. And I suppose that sometimes that is useful.
DB: What do you think you came away with in terms of positive self­
development out of your education at Brown and what do you think was
damaging?
RC: I did that, didn't I? I already talked about that.
DB: Some, I just wondered if there was anything else.
RC: Well, I just ... I don't know what more I can really say. Other than the
fact that I am constantly under my own scrutiny and still trying to figure out
what I want to be when I grow up. So, I've found a lot of problems with the
entertainment industry ... because I feel like one of the first (pause-shuffling
papers) ... there are a couple of things I could talk about here but I don't
know if they would answer the question. What was the question?
DB: Positive self-development.
RC: Oh, how was ... (pause-shuffle) oh, well I think I sorted our some
direction for myself. I really--well, as a result of being educated .. . see, it's
really tough to say what I would have found an affinity for had I been some
place else. (pause) I am just kind of curious because what I would have been
motivated to do or what I would have made a career in had I been able to
expand on my interest in the sciences. Seeing that my teacher chose to
undermine my being involved with the National Institutes of Health and
those goals. And, then when I got to Brown, my own insecurities kind of
kept me from really competing in those areas . Had things gone well and I
had I taken advantage of any of the opportunities that were there, I probably
could have been a part of the establishment--the hierarchical order of one of
the same science organizations that I am criticizing now--which I couldn't
participate in because I ended up being somewhat of a wimp. But my
interests have really focused on self-development and, I think, I have some
very liberal and very creative solutions for myself personally and for society
and one of those solutions has to deal with promoting self-sufficient housing.
And another one of those solutions has to deal with promoting the blue­
green algae that I am taking which is grown in Lake Klamath in Oregon. And
that is a nutritional product that gives you the kind of support that you don't

Campbell 15

get from the foods that you buy in the stores because all the all the soils are
demineralized and it turns out that-to kind of go back to what I discovered in
dealing with vitamins and herbs as solutions for different physical ailments-­
it turns out that this particular product gives you the kind of nutrition where
you have a lot of mental clarity and you have a lot of physical stamina; and, it
helps ... heal problems that you might otherwise think are chronic problems
and if you ever consult a physician, he might give you some type of synthetic
drug to address that problem when in reality all you needed was just the right
nutrition. And that nutrition was just such a weak topic of discussion when I
was growing up and people really didn't take it very seriously, but the
industry that we've been promoting has really depleted all of the soils. The
soils right now are demineralized to the point where they just use nitrogen
and phosphorous and a third component which is a synthetic supplement
that goes into the soil and they lack all the subtle cartenoids and cofactors that
come along with a truly organic soil. One farmer was just talking in an article
about how he .. . when he was doing his harvest, couldn't see one worm in
all of the acres that he had harvested. That is a statement right there. That
everything we're dealing with has lost all the general nutritional factors that
we should be having. I think that's one of the first things that we need to
address in this society. But the particular product that I am interested in has
been given by the company that I am involved with now to students in
Nicaragua as well as to gangs in [Los Angeles] and they have been doing these
studies that show how their interest in learning and their performance levels
have risen 20 to 30 to 40% just by virtue of having the right nutrition. And
I've had--and this is all self-development because if you don't have your
health, you certainly can't proceed with taking care of yourself and dealing
with specific issues in your intellectual life if you don't have the proper
energy. And so much of that is interdependent that I ... just have gotten to
be really holistic (laughs) and I'm just trying to find a way and I think when I
look at how productive the non-traditional Brown had been . .. that really is
reflected in today's curriculum and thinking that out of the era that I came
out of, I definitely am a product of that. I am looking for ways to not hurt the
environment; to limit the amount of toxins that go into the atmosphere, into
the environment and into myself; and to just try to find productive ways to
address homelessness and the educational problems we have and all of these
relate to my interest in nutrition and self-sufficient housing. (pause) I kind
of went through one damaging situation which was my experience with that
faculty advisor. And there was another situation that I thought was very
strange. I was talking with a white female professor about my insecurity ...
Finally, I did kind of grow into recognizing when I was feeling unsure about
myself and from that previous experience with that calculus exam, so when I
felt insecure, I went to the professor and I said that but I didn't get any
feedback. (laughs) So, it was really, you know, you learn one lesson and you
try to grow, and then you apply that to another situation and you might not
have the personality there that wants to pIa y ball. For whatever reason . She
could have been racist. She could have been just quiet. (laughs) And had her

Campbell 16

own set of anxieties. I ended up with a really good grade from that course but
I didn't really get the kind of feedback that I thought I should have had from
her and the kind of rapport. I don't know, I still might have some blind spots
about what's been damaging. Do you see any ways that I have been damaged
that you think I should know?
DB: I think when you were saying how you think retrospectively about your
background about the way in which you were raised and what values that has
passed on to you, and then deciding which one of those don't work for you
and which you should keep. That seems a very valuable mindset.
RC: It's very difficult to pick out things that were damaging. I mean, a lot of
damage was done by just being in the horne. And wonderful as I think my
parents are and I know a lot of things that were perpetrated upon me that
they just didn't recognize as being potentially damaging. I know that I just
can't blame them. We all kind of hold responsibility ... Well, at a certain
point, we hold responsibility to grow out of certain things that were put upon
us. Do you want me to respond to what I would change?
DB: I think you have sort of addressed that. I think we should move on
some post-graduation questions. Could you tell us a little about what you
have been doing since graduation?
RC: I did that. I talked about the theater.
DB: Did you go to graduate school?
RC: Well, no. I took a couple of certificate programs. At Harvard, a
publishing procedures course [and] at Duke University an Arts Management
course. I applied to graduate school--hmm, let me see; maybe four years ago
now--and I got accepted to University of New Mexico because I was really
excited about working closely with an architect who developed some
interesting self-sufficient housing technology. And, as I said to you, I see
interesting applications for the homeless and he is teaching people how to-­
they're interesting applications which will probably address more readily
people who can't find a comfortable place in capitalism. And I could see
where if he engaged other human resources like prisoners to use this new
technology to build self-sufficient housing, then the homeless who have
mental problems can take advantage of that housing and then the prisoners,
in turn, are able to walk away with a skill where, if they can't get a job, they
know how to build their own shelters. .. and grow their own food and it's
just giving a piece of land that's designated for that use ... so they don't feel
like they have to take someone else's property because they can't find a place
in society. But (pause) what was I saying; what was the question?

Campbell 17

DB: You were telling me about some of the things you have been doing since
graduation--University of New Mexico.
RC: Oh yes, so. I had made up my mind that that's what I wanted to do and
my brother had just died from bone marrow cancer during that period and
then my father says to me, once I told him I was accepted-I didn't get accepted
to Brown and I didn't get accepted to MIT and I have a feeling that that had a
lot to do with people being in line and there being some political stuff where
you have to--because there are only seven positions in the department that I
wanted to go into at Brown and less than that at MIT, I am sure that there
were people who were in line and getting in line and getting in line year after
year. So, well, after that I got accepted to the University of New Mexico and
my father had just had a couple of operations on his lungs and had almost
lost his life and says to me that he doesn't want me to go that far away. And
I'm like devastated, what do I say to this man who's supported me through
school, who's just lost a child, and he's asking me this. So I passed on it and
I'm not sure whether that was the right decision. But it was one of those
situations where I just felt at the time that I needed to do what he wanted me
to do. And I'll just have to pursue it at another point and I am not really sure
when that is going to arise again. It may never happen but I feel like with the
resources that I'll be accumulating with this next business venture, maybe I
will. (laughs) I had a really good period .. . let's see, I did the theater
management thing and then I also worked with the library. I did a centennial
exhibit for the Providence Public Library's lOath anniversary. I did a huge
exhibit there; I tried to get people involved and there were people with
Ph.D.'s and Masters who would not operate outside of their little boundaries
that are defined for them and that was really sad because I really view the
libraries as media centers with a lot of interesting activities and a lot of
wonderful concepts to explore but it's going to take them a long time to really
get that [movingl if people don't loosen up a little bit . .. I should have started
at that point writing for moneys to design my own direction, but in a sense,
when I left the state department, r had a certain amount of money from my
retirement fund to invest in Artists' Development Group [ADG,l which has
been my talent business for the past 12 years and I have represented
performing groups and individuals to hospitality rooms and public relations
campaigns and I've also represented commercial advertising services such as
photography to advertisers and . . . those kinds of things. But I have found
that I have grown tired of getting paid on a per-project basis because I always
end up investing more sweat, blood, and tears into the project that I am
getting in financial returns. So I've really been involved in shopping around
scripts and properties that will turn into residual moneys for myself. And I
do have a girlfriend of mine who is Loretta Divine and she was here with me
at Rites and Reason and she got her first big break as one of the Dream Girls.
And in the last few years, she's been on The Cosby Show, A Different World,
and what else. She's been on something with Sherman Hemsley. She's done
some feature films with Sidney Portier and people of his stature and has had

Campbell 18

her own television show called Sugar and Spice and was also on Patti
LaBelle's show, which was ... [Up All Night]. Anyway, so I am promoting
her script, Hanging with the Hunks, which is about her sister's experience in
managing an all-black male strip tease group ... Something interesting has
happened in the course of this, she has gotten this part with Whitney
Houston and Angela Bassett in Waiting to Exhale. She's the woman on the
far--if you've seen the promotional, she's the woman on the far left of the
promotional poster. So there is a lot of heavier weight added to help me
maybe leverage this out into some sort of television thing. Something may
come out of the entertainment industry (laughs) that has some real economic
significance in my life but I'm not really counting on it; it's just one of those
things but it would be really nice. We were promoting a thing called Divas
and then Fox came out--we wanted to do a classical tour ... and we were
going to bill it as a three divas thing which would have been very, very
dramatic and interesting but it turns out that I didn't pursue that because
there was a previous show called Divas--that I was unaware of and only
found out about during the promotion of that project. So anyway, we will see
what happens with that. But I have not lost sight of my--and I have not lost
dedication to--trying to promote this nutritional project and trying to
promote the self-sufficient housing bit. And in the '80s, when I must have
had about 50 accounts with the ADG group and was doing really well, I built
a house--a $460,000 kind of--I don't know--glamour box--in western Cranston,
with built-in skylights and a back wall with all glass on a couple of acres. 25'
high ceilings with like an atrium, with a really nice collection of plants. An
interesting architectural statement but
[End Tape 2, Side 1]
RC: The house building experience was just revealing because I really wanted
to pursue, at that point even, solar housing and no one wanted to cooperate
with me and nobody wanted to hear from me . . , I only really built the
house in order to sell it to get money to move on out of my partnership. I
think that aspect of my life was kind of built on the wrong foundation and
since then I have changed my aspirations--I mean, not changed, but just
redirected my energy in some ways that I think are just more fundamental to
stabilizing this society . And as much as I love the arts and entertainment
industry, I feel like there are some things that need to be addressed more
quickly and more immediately ... I've always had that bottom line in my
mind as a major issue in my life and my work with the human service
agencies and things like that but I really have not gotten my thinking
crystallized about how to deal with all that at once. And, in a sense, the
housing thing and the nutrition thing, are all really interdisciplinary--they all
relate to the anthropology of urban environments and it all relates to the arts
because it's about designing a really well-integrated environment that have
kind of a cohesion in term of a value system with some kind of balance and
an interest in trying to push society toward a more civilized and fair place.

Campbell 19

You know food and housing should be a right, not just something that you
are lucky to have ... that's it.
DB: Well, thank you very much.
RC: You are quite welcome.
