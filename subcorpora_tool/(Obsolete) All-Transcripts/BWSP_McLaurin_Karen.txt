Derria Byrd: Wha t type of experiences led to you coming to Brown?
Karen McLaurin: I attended an all-girls, private parochial school, and I tended to
associate myself with the high achievers. It was a very undiversified student
population - mostly white women. And in discussions with students I had heard
about Brown. And our top two students intended to come to Brown. So that's what
led me down the road.
DB: Was it your decision or did your guidance counselor make the suggestion that
you come to Brown?
KM: No, actually my guidance counselor suggested that I apply to secretarial schools
or go to a community college. And considering the fact that my parents were paying
$2500 a year for me to go there, I figured that they in turn deserved more and so did
I. So I disregarded what the guidance counselor advised and I came down to Brown
for an interview. I had also applied to Simmons, BU, Hofstra in New York, and
Yale.
DB: What were your expectations and why did you choose Brown?
KM: Well, when I had visited the Yale campus, it just didn't appeal to me. When I
visited Brown, I experienced so much more and I am sure that the students had a lot
to do with that. Simmons was all women and having gone to a (DB laughs) high
school with all women, I really wasn't anxious to go there. Hofstra was a co-ed
school and when I went (laughs) to a weekend where the university invited students
to come visit the school, I fell asleep on several of the sessions. (DB and KM laugh)
So I really wasn't into that. And BU was to big for me. It didn't have a small
community-type setting where I would feel comfortable.
DB: So at the time that you decided to come to Brown, how common was it for your
family members to be college-educated?
KM: How common? (yes) My sister was the first in my family to go to college.
Neither of my parents were college graduates. I do have my uncle, my father's
brother, who had gone to college and never completed. And his wife went to
college and did complete. On both my mother's and father's sides, I was the first to
graduate from college.
DB: So even though your parents hadn't attended college,
toward the university setting?

there was still that push

McLaurin-8

DB: Is it safe to say that most of your friends are from the same racial, class lines?
religion?
KM: Yes. Alicia's mother was a hairdresser and my mother was a hairdresser.
(laughs) I don't know much about her history, but I know that she and I both had
mothers who were hairdressers. And I shouldn't say yes that everything was the
same, I had a dear friend and you know we still keep in touch, Karen Freeman, her
parents - her father was a lawyer and her mother was a teacher and she and her
sister came to Brown. I guess I guess ... yea, I won't get into that. But they are what
one can characterize as upper upper middle class. And I guess we, by default,
became that just by the economics not because - both of my parents having not gone
to college seemed to pull in an outstanding income. You know, which is something
special. [pause] and yea when I think back, most of my peers, their parents went to
college. You know, yea. So now we weren't from the same educational
backgrounds, but economic backgrounds - yes.
DB: How was your Brown career affected by being an African American woman?
KM: Hmm, Brown career? See, I always felt while I was at Brown I could do
anything I wanted to do (laughs) I just needed to go to the right person to support
me. And that was, I never felt as though my being an African American woman
was a handicap. Professor Martel calls me his shining star, you know, I mean, of
his class, you know. I never knew that. But the man invited us over for dinner and
that was - during my stay at Brown as a student. we used to have monthly sherry
hours. (DB laughs) Really, we were all getting sloshes together. (KM & DB laugh)
No, but you know we had sherry and we had cheese and crackers and we had special
guests come in. And that was a faculty-student activity that I thought was pretty
special.
DB: It seems that back then there was a lot more faculty student interaction. (KM:
Yes, yes. Right. I think so.) What was the difference between student relations off
campus as opposed to on campus?
KM: I don't think that there was a problem.. I can recall going off campus to see
some of my friends. And these are friends that people don't forget. The friendships
that were fostered here as a student always live. You know . I could pick up the
phone and call somebody I hadn't spoken to in five years and they talk to me and we
talk to each other as if we saw each other yesterday, you know . Those were healthy
positive relationships of people caring about each other. I never saw it to be problem
because we had plenty of people... some people were married living on campus but
that didn't did not put walls between our lines of communication. I know I never
thought of living off campus. I like the comfort of being in the dorms. Remember
we used to have maids. (DB: Ho ho, maids?l) Yes! They used to know in Andrews
the people who worked that dorm and most of them the ones I remember were
African American. They cared about our environment. They cared about making

McLaurin-9

sure everything was clean and alright for us . And that was special too.
DB: As far as black communities at other schools, was there conflict?
KM: Actually I can remember. I think it was in '73, '72-'73, a group of us from
OUAP went out to URI to help them get organized . Very often I think that we
thought we were the elite and we the ones who had the know-how and therefore we
needed to educate our brothers and sisters on other campuses. And very often, our
leadership would speak on behalf of the institutions. So we use to go out and do our
service with the other campuses. And also we used to keep in contact in the '70s
there were a number of brothers over at PC who used to come over here and be part
of our family. You know, we used to party. We never partied out at URI, but we
did help them in a time of crisis . With PC, Vie used to party back and forth. I
remember that. And I knew a couple of their football players who came from my
hometown.
DB: So relations between black men and women on campus were pretty good then?
KM: Yea. But (DB: laughs) there was a sense of - once again - there was a sense of
community and it's really interesting when you look back yes, the relationships
were good. They were like brother /sister for the most part. And you have to also
remember that when I came, it was the first year that no, wait a minute now, yea I
was the first Brown class if my memory serves me right. At that point there was no
sense of adversity because most of us were glad to see the brothers. And we used to
party. We partied together. Not that we shouldn't, but you know. We did party
together on a regular basis (DB & KM laugh) We had a good time, really. It seemed
like almost every week there was a party and we had a good time.
DB: What do you think Brown tried to teach you or taught you about women's place
in society?
KM: Well I knew that there was a place because, once again, I didn't feel that
pressure. I didn't feel as though a man was treating me differently because I am a
woman. And it was a sense of empowerment you know to feel as thought (1) here
you are a student whose living away from, who has to make their own decisions,
who has to be assertive, has to you know proceed along in am exemplary fashion.
You know to be respected. I never felt that discrimination. I really didn't. Nobody
told me because I was a woman or because I was black that I could not do. And you
have to remember that my parents were paying the ticket here, so you know there is
a special obligation you have to try to do the best that I can and work toward
excellence.
DB: What kind of impact did your classroom experiences have after Brown?
KM: (laughs) Well I'll tell you one thing, I realized that Brown had vary caring
professors because from here I went to Simmons school of social work, which was

McLaurin-lO

what I viewed as an insecure environment, especially with African American
women. I didn't feel insecure but I felt as though the faculty was not stable. When I
went on to Boston College law school, that's where the real snap, I mean I
discovered that all teachers are not educators. All teachers do not care about their
student population and that was the attitude that Brown had shown me. In one
case, there was a professor who was not that nice and fortunately I had an ally in the
Deans' office who could assert himself to help me with this professor who was an
assistant professor. That was the one and only assistant professor I had.
DB: Was the Brown-Tougaloo program active when you ...
KM: I mean a TA actually I would call him . (laughs) What did you say, hon?
DB: The Brown-Tougaloo program, was it active?
KM: Well, it may have been active. But I did not participate. I knew about it but
something just did not sell it to me. And sure, one thing I would do if I had to do it
again would be to go to Tougaloo and see what the other side is like.
[end Tape I, Side 1]
DB: The Churchill House was created in '72 .
surrounded that? Was there a big brouhaha?

What were the issues which

KM: In when? (DB: 1972) Well, here's the deal. [pauses] We used to have a Black
House on Bowen Street. And that used to be the place that we had our meetings, or
we partied, or we had special guests and so on . And in '72 was the year before I left,
I don't remember the hoopla. You know. Because that also provided a home for
Rites and Reasons . So the Afro Society was there and Rites and Reasons was there.
So you know I don't remember any hoopla . Do you recall reading about any .. .
DB: I just know that in the Third World activism in the Archives there was a lot
about issues about space and who received it and how it was to be used. And I guess,
maybe as far as other students were concerned, racial issues about what was gonna
be going on in the Churchill House. Was it going to be a place for political
organization or was it gonna be where the African American studies was.
KM: Well, it just so happens that Afro Am was there, Rites and Reasons was there,
and we used to have the Afro Society there. And "vhatever hoopla took place in '72
obviously it did not boil over until '85. (DB : Right.) Which is the acquisition of this
house [the Third World Center] . So, I don't remember it.
DB: I was going to ask you about the relations between black students but we already
covered that pretty much . And relations bet,,,,een students and faculty.
KM:

Yea, and that's my perspective. Bu t Dr. Monroe - she may have a another

McLaurin-II

perspective because she was doing medical, she you know was the pre-med route.
And that's a whole other constituency that I never came into contact with. The
same with engineering. Darwyn may have another critique due to her experiences
in engineering. See I didn't touch those.
DB: As far as the Transitional Summer Program - you were involved with it so I
guess it was effective.
KM: Well, it was eight weeks and it offered you everything that TWTP [Third
World Transition Program] gets assailed for. It offers you an opportunity to learn
the campus. It offers you to have a chance to be exposed to faculty and
administrators and deans. It offers you a head start toward academics although there
was no credit for that. And we also had a chance to meet some of your classmates. A
larger population of classmates than most have an opportunity to be exposed to.
And you know, you're kind of settled. By the time, you know once you're here for
two months you feel as though ok, you know where Thayer St. is, you know where
everywhere on the campus, and as for me, as familiar with the campus as I was, I
never went over to Wayland. I did go to .. .! never went to Wayland but I always
went over to the Quad . You had all kinds of people staying over there.
DB: It's funny that you should mention TWTP because it seems like every year after
TWTP, there's this big outpouring of letters from the white community contesting
what goes on at TWTP, and I wondered was there that sante type of attitude toward
the TSP program?
KM: No, not that I knew of. Actually, yes, you're right, every year there's
something about TWTP, only this year we got it from an Asian American. But
anyway, I don't remember any backlash, I don't remember any that being made an
issue because you have to remember that we were considered the less-likelies. You
know. And out of that pool of less-likelies, you've got lawyers, you got talk show
hosts, you got multi-million dollar business people, you've got anesthesiologists,
you've got you know engineers and then you do have you know it's hard breaking
to say but you know not out of that group but I do recall coming into contact with
some of the earlier graduates that experienced nervous breakdowns. Now I'm not
saying Brown created the nervous breakdowns, but it ended up that that happened
here. You know. And that's troubling. But that's not that group as far, urn yea, I
can remember two people out of that group who came with me both had nervous
breakdowns, couldn't deal with it, you know?
DB: I guess maybe since it was more of an academic setting for TSP that's why...
KM: That's the difference . Whereas TWTP gets into culture and class and racism,
[pause] and cross-cultural relations which was never an issue when I was here.
DB: What was the presence of African American women faculty persons?

McLaurin-12

KM: When I was here? I don't remember any faculty, African American females
faculty.
DB: I read about a woman named Nanette Reynolds.
KM: Now Nanette was after me I presume. Yea, she was after me. But there was
another woman before Nanette. When was Nanette here?
DB: I'm not really sure but when I was looking through ... (KM: I don't really
remember) the '73 yearbook, I saw her name was mentioned as one of the deans.
KM: I don't remember Nanette being a dean . Isn't that weird?
DB: Maybe Bill Brown filled all your dean needs, so
KM: [laughs] Yea, he sure did. And we keep saying especially my class that we gotta
give that man something. We have to do something. I'm hoping to get a bust of
him made. I think that maybe the best thing. If we have anywhere to put it [laughs]
yea, that's something that I thought of last year, and I gotta not last year, a couple of
years ago, during our all-class reunion in 1990. I thought of doing that but it was too
hectic; we had to much going on. But we're gonna have to do something, and I
hope that something happens so you can amend this to say yea it happened. They
did something. (DB: They did it. laughs) Yea yea.
DB: How important was Uwezo and the African Sun to communication for the
African American community?
KM: I don't recall when they evolved to enough to know that... did they exist when I
was here, too? [DB: Yes.] Wow. I don't know (laughs). I truly don't know. I guess
since you say it was then it is a fact then I am sure it served a constituency of people
who needed to have tha t.
DB: I am not sure how frequently it came out. But looking through the Third
World Activism, it was just on a sheet of paper and probably just handed out. [KM:
Right.] What was the cultural atmosphere for African Americans in Providence and
on campus. You mentioned the Black Arts Festivals.
KM: You know I noticed that there was a population of people who talked about,
"The townies are going to come to our parties." or "We don't want the townies to
come." And I know the specific people who said that and they clearly were not, if
you want to talk about class, were not anybody to be shutting out anybody. But
(laughs) I did cultivate you know sonle good relationships with people from the
community. And you know they were welcome to our parties. But I would hear a
few snide remarks about that. You know just the community at large.
DB: What were your relations with non-black students on campus?

McLaurin-13

KM: Well, as a number of my classmates have told me, I had one, one, there was
one male who made leather belts and did leather work. And believe me I wish I
could remember his name. But he was the class behind me, the class of '75. And he
was a wonderful [pause] person, very creative. So we kept in touch with each other,
but once I left, we never continued the lines of communication. You know, during
my 20th reunion [pause] yea, a lot of us discovered how many white people we did
not know. But that did not make me feel bad because there were a number of white
people there who didn't know anybody. So I think that is also a sign of the times.
But there are also some people in my class that knew a number of people, white
people, in the class by virtue of their majors. But, unfortunately, I was on a tunnel­
vision track. So the only white people that I interacted with were the professors.
DB: You might not have an answer for this question since you were on a tunnel­
vision track, but as I was reading where some people thought that white students
saw the black students on campus as professors of black culture. That they had to
stop, one guy said that he could barely get down the hall before he someone stopped
him and asked him some kind of question. Did you feel like [KM: oh!]they saw you
as some type of educator to tell them what was going on with black people on
campus ...
KM: It is funny that you asked that because that class that I had a hard time in with
the professor, he'd make some racist remarks and I'd come back with that's not
appropriate (laughs) you know and that that's not an accurate depiction of typical
family life in urban areas. He had black folks as welfare recipients and I said, "No,
I'm not going to let you sit here in this class and tell this population, who may not
know, that lie." You know, this man and I went at it. All the time. And he wanted
to flunk me because he wanted to flunk me. And at that point you know I went
right to Dean Brown. I said, "Don't you dare think that you are going to flunk me
because you are casting such racist remarks." And I didn't put it in that light.
Actually he was equating inner city people who were African American were just
welfare recipients and that's it and that's as far as they want to go. I couldn't have
that because I know a number of people - I grew up in the city. And I know what
goes on there. A number of African Americans do not leave the city like my parents
did. Bu t they had a Ii ttle thing that they had to prove for themselves, you know?
So and you know, a lot of things I did in the city. I took my piano lessons in the city;
I had my violin lessons in the city; I had my dancing lessons in the city, and my
acting lessons - all in African American environments. Living in a white
community.
DB: I just have a few nanles listed who I wanted to ask about as someone who is
now a colleague with these persons such as Rhett Jones and Ferdinand Jones. Were
they active in your career?
KM: Well, I know, I've heard students tell me about Ferd and how warm and
wonderful he was, but I never took any psych courses, nor did I take any history.

McLaurin-14

But I've heard about Rhett and how wonderful a man he was. I find them both to be
quite supportive since I've been here. And prior to my arrival in this position, they
were supportive, you know? So they've always been supportive, I just never had to
lean on their shoulders.
DB: You said that you worked with OUAP, and Michael Spearman was the co-chair
KM: Yes! Yes! Yes! And Michael, Michael was the one who got hit in the eye. Did
you know that? (DB: Oh, I didn't know that was him..) Yea, that was Michael
Spearman. And twenty years later, I saw Michael and I was so thrilled to see him
because I hadn't seen him since. Wonderful person! Still the same person as the
one I knew twenty years ago. Yet, a different, as a judge now. The honorable...
DB: Well we've talked about Bill Brown quite extensively, there's a Richard Nurse
a black admissions officer and Anderson Kurtz assistant dean of student affairs.
KM: Now when Anderson was here, I was not here . But when Dick Nurse was
here I think I was on my way out. But he was here when I was here. It's just that my
interaction was limited. But I do remember there was another woman - there was
another admissions officer, Pat Hodges who is not probably in our records that we
need to put in our records . She was here as an admissions officer. She's the reason
that I applied to teacher's college. NYU's teachers' college. They had a PhD program
in education. But at any rate, Pat had mobilized us, Pat had us you know going
when we'd go home you know to do informationals on Brown. Going back to our
hometown schools. Pat had us at college fairs. She'd pay us and then give us a little
money to eat. You know what I mean? Paid for the transportation . And we had a
ball doing that. Going back home and we could see all of our buddies and we would
go to these college fairs and talk about how wonderful Brown was because we had
positive attitudes toward the school. Am I jumping around here?
DB: No, the African American studies department - did you get into that much? Do
you know what kind of resources were offered to students through the department?
KM: I know that my peers who came later were excited about Afro Am. I think that
that was a major accomplishment that the program was established - very important
for Brown. And it also offers an additional option for not only African Americans
but also students from other ethnic backgrounds which is so important. It adds a
special perspective. They get a new perspective from those professors . Real
important.
DB: How active was Rites and Reasons?
KM: Oh, you know there was one more person that you forgot to mention which is
Michael Harper. (DB: Oh, I didn't know he "\lvas here then.) Yea! Michael Harper
inspired - he was kind. I can remember one of the students saying to me, "Wow, you
know Professor Harper doesn't mess around, don't mess with him." [KM & DB

McLaurin·IS

laugh] And I said why not. He's an English professor and I want to do a poetry book.
Who else, what better person to go to because he's a poet? So then I ended up doing
a [pause] biography. autobiography kinda sorta. you know. But he was wonderful to
work with. He was really challenging. He was really positive. And he said, "Now
don't mess my, don't waste my time now. If you want to me to you know [laughs]
supervise this independent study, you know then you're going to have a work
project." You know, but he was wonderful. Michael Harper has been here for a
number of years. And served great service to Brown, just by being here and being
real and being honest. You know and dealing with students, so. (DB laughs) Oh
sorry.
DB: What was your department?
KM: Sociology. [DB: Oh no] Yes how did you guess, how did you guess? [laughs]
Yea Martel boy he he ..Students are his lifeline. And I have never met a more
[pause] sincere professor at Brown. Really . And that's not to say that Rhett's not
sincere and that is not to say anything about my African American professors but
this man spen t his time. I wasn't even working - I took his classes because I was just
so [pause] impressed by his feelings. That wa.s significant to me and you know I
thought it was real special to take a class by someone who's written the book - but I
worked with Professor Marsh. You know I did research for him but Martet I took
his classes. I had to take one class with Professor Marsh, that was it.
DB: Who or what were your support networks while you were at Brown?
KM: [pause] My colleagues. My mother. She'd con1e down and she'd feed us all.
[laughs] On Sundays, you know . People would be calling me up at 9 o'clock in the
morning talking about his your mother coming down? [DB & KM laugh] I said
please. Yea, she used to bring us dinners. And tha t's something real special to a lot
of people from the class of '72, '73, and '74. No, '73 and '74. Yea. '72, "3, and "4 ­
Yea, I got it right the first time. Sorry. [laughs]
DB: What do you feel was missing from your education at Brown?
KM: [pause] I enjoyed the liberty and the latitude to not have to take a science or a
math; however, I think that I had a strong potential in the sciences and did not
pursue it because out of fear. Because I did well in high school in biology and
chemistry and I really should have stayed ","ith it. You know and I didn't. So that's
one of the things I would change.
DB: When you look over, back over your Brown years,
them?

how do you feel about

KM: I feel very POSItIve. I think Brown let me know that I could be everything I
could be. And I wanted to be, you know what I mean? By the time I finished with
Brown. Finished with Brown? (laughs) Graduated (DB & KM laugh) That's the way

McLaurin-16

I act but it's not negative. That's the way it may sound, but it's not negative. When
I left Brown I felt as though I shouldn't have the luxury of being a student for 4
years. I also thought I would be saving my parents money by staying for 3 years. I
felt as though I had everything I needed to equi p me to move on. When I applied to
graduate programs, PhDs and Master programs, I got accepted to each and everyone
of them. I said, "Wow what is going on here?" (laughs) It's just like, "Now what
do I do?" You know, you figure, "Oh nah, I won't get accepted so I'll make a
decision, which direction I'm going from after I get responses." And when they all ­
I was overwhelmed. When they all said yes, come and we'll even give you some
money. (DB & KM laugh) You know. I said, "Woah, this is too much." But and I
kind of, I do regret in terms of academic direction, I do regret not going for the
DSW. or the PhD. I kind of look at it like that was obviously a bad decision to get
the middle degree instead of going for the top.
DB: What influenced your decision to go on to graduate school?
KM: I'll tell you frankly, I didn't think about graduate school. I thought about the
theses aspect of my responsibility as a student and I knew that whatever I wanted to
do, I needed an advanced degree and that this college education was not going to do
it for me. And I felt as though you know, there was so much more that I really
should be learning. So that was the motivation and my parents also congratulated
me and said, "And you're going to pay this time." (laughs) You know? And so
they promised us undergraduate degrees, but after that, we were on our own. So I
always had it in me that I would have to get a higher degree . I wasn't secure about
staying with just an undergraduate degree.
DB: What were your graduate school decisions based upon and how did you work it
out financially?
KM: Well, like I said, I was overwhelmed and I let somebody else make the decision
for me which was not the right decision. I did look to Professor Martel, I said,
"Look at all these schools of social work I got accepted to. I can go for a PhD, I can go
for a doctorate in social work, and I could get a PhD in education. You know where
where do I go?" You know. "What do I do here?" And he said go to Simmons
school of social work . And that was a good time for me to realize that you have to
when you create your career path through your education, you have to have some
inner strength to take you from your fr eshman year to your ending year. So you go
to go with your gut feeling. And I went with my gut feeling all along until it was
you know, it came time for a choice. And I think that perhaps I'd always stay with
social work in some forms or fashion. And you know, if I thought about it again,
I'd go for the DSW. Cause that challenges you to a higher degree. And that is the
challenge that Brown supposedly prepared me for. (DB & KM laugh)
DB: So, did he choose Simmons because it "vas big in social work at the time or does
it have a good reputation?

McLaurin-17

KM: Well, well there were a couple of reasons why. Yea, they had a top reputation
in the school of social work. Freud's granddaughter taught there. And she was a
delight - Anna Freud. She was a delight. She was a great professor. She really was
and I did have some great professors. My field work advisor was no good. She was
not good. She had an identity issues with herself. Then, she was not known to
reach out to the community and Simmons also was psychotherapeutic. And that's
very different from community development and community organizing. You
know what I mean? And those were the categories. And I am sure that Professor
Martel's decision was well-founded because it was in theory and it was programs that
were his background. See and he didn't know about all of the other things I was
doing.
DB: What did you do between leaving Brown and coming back as administration?
KM: Hmm, what did I do? I was a campaign manager for a city counselor. I was a
case worker for a children's - Little Flower Children Services in Brooklyn, NY - I was
a consultant for the city of District of Columbia. And I worked with a company
training my peers (laughs) to teach high school studetns. And I also supervised that
program and co-ordinated all the legistics and gathered all the research and over-saw
my peers for that. I also worked with Senator Kennedy . You did ask me what I did
after all this. (laughs) I also worked with Senator Kennedy, I was a legislative
intern for him. And I focused on things, see I love new things, on agriculture and
biomass energy. I researched his brother's Indian [pause] affairs background and
added to that for him. And I also got something for myself. I requested that I work
on juvenile justice issues. And made recommendations for some things that did
come into work. What else did I do? I also worked on his campaign to be president
because I was there at that time. I also felt as though he was a good candidate for it.
And then ????? ???? just came in and [makes chopping motions with hands]
messed it all up. I also worked as director of operations for a health center in
Roxbury, Massachusetts - Harvard Street Neighborhood Health Center and did some
marvelous things there. (DB laughs) I was responsiblew for making them tax­
exempt. Do you believe that a non-profit agency was not tax-exempt? Well, I made
it tax-exempt from you know the property taxes and I remember specifically certain
cases from community organization so I went right to it and made then exempt from
paying for property taxes. I got the building more user-friendly. They had a nasty
carpetting, they had poor signage, I pulled together their pharmacy and ordered all
the pharmaceutical supplies. Worked with the lab and ordered all of their supplies
for the processing of tests. Worked with all the secretaries and you know gettin'
them up to speed you know and some training for them. Worked with the
mailroom - did a lot of things there. And also did the community outreach stuff like
the free blood pressure testing and made sure we're visible at health fairs. And
made sure we were visible also for the community when they have big like the
Caribbean Festival, m.ade sure that \'I'e had a booth there for blood pressure testing
and cholesterol testing and that sort. And so I accomplished a lot within a year and a
half and said see ya later . (DB: That was all within a year and a half?) Yea, (DB: oh
boy! laughs) yea, yea. Then I went I also directed a program and I really and truly

McLaurin-IS

loved this program because when I hd gone to the interview for this job my
girlfriend's mother was you know my prospective boss. I had two bosses for two
different school districts. This program allowed me to be creative with high school
students. It allowed me to do a community service type component and those were
the very special art festivals. Getting our students to volunteer for that. As well as a
nursing home for all the birthday parties that the nursing home had, there were
pre-Thanksgiving parties, pre-Christmas parties, our middle-school students and
high school students would go do something special for them. Halloween - make
masks, read some poetry. We had students who regularly went to read to blind
peole, or go play cards and games with people who are going to be in the nursing
home until they die. So to enrich their quality of life and also to raise their levels of
awareness, that they do owe it to their community to do things. So that was real
good . We got great television coverage on a number of things that we did. We also
had students teaching - high school students - teaching high school students and
middle school students how to ski . How to white water raft . That was the program
that I amended to that outdoor adventure component. Canoeing, hiking, biking,
skiing. And it was it gave me such joy to see all these African American, Asian
American, Latino students all there together working together. And also learning
together and you know helping each other when they feel as though you know one
thinks they can excel better. Creating that multi-ethnic and cultural environment
for them to be able to work together. We also had a tutorial program and we did a
mock trial series where the jurors were the middle school students and the defense
teams and prosecutorial team were high school students. And we had a real judge
and we went into a real courtroom and we had school volunteers come train,
summons our middle school students (DB laughs) and subpoena them. Summons
them and then subpoenas to the witnesses . Oh it was fun, it was really wonderful.
We got great PR for that. And what I mean by PR is that our students were on t.v.
news you know, student leadership program does this, student leadership program
does that, and then there was a program, called Very Positively New England that
did a tape on our program. So I thought that was special. That's great publicity.
And then, I did something that was mildly boring but not so boring, I did contracts
and leasing for the Massachusettes Port Authority which is where I was before I came
here. Then in '88 I came to Brown to work in the Alumni Relations office. And let
me tell you how networking works. (DB laughs) When I was working with the
school department, I had spoken to one of the N ASPers - Bernestine McCleod,
Harold Bailey's wife, I said Bernestine, now I know you do this N ASP stuff
interviewing prospective students. But do you think you could hook up something
with admissions and financial aid and give my kids SOlT),e lunch and a tour and what
do you think you can do? Well , I'll check. She called me back, we'll I can
accomodate you. I said wonderful, i mean the whole thing? She said, yes. So we
brought two buses of studetns . We did a college tour, too . And brought a couple of
busloads of prospective students, admissions and financial aid did speak to them.
They went on a tour, they had lunch over at the Ratty and they went back home.
(laughs) But that was a wonderful thing, And we had said thank you to her for
accomodating us two years in a row but each year we had a recognition - multi­
ethnic recognition ceremony - where we thank ed everybody who helped us. We

McLaurin-19

gave them certificate of apprecIatIon and flowers or whatever. Little tokens of
appreciation to say thank you for taking time out of your life to enrich ours. And
that's when I invited so then they said, they got to thinking and they knew that the
alumni relations office needed somebody to direct the Third World Alumni. So
Harold called me up because he knew the director of Alumni activities - Alumni
Relations and said will you consider this job? I said oh sure, sure yea I'll call her.
Two or threee weeks later, did you call her? (laughs) No, I didn't call her. But I
promise you that I'll call her. Let it go. I was actually quite preoccupied at that time.
There was a lot of construction at the airport. There were a lot of stipulations and
agreements that needed to be seen to. A lot of the construction took place in the
quiet times - early in the morning, late at night. You know. It was really interesting.
I became quite friendly with the concession stand . "Oh come on, Karen! Have
something to eat." (DB & KM laugh) You know so I never went hungry at the
airport. But that was and then the director of Alumni Relations at that time, her
name was Heidi Janes, she called me up and asked if I was interested . So I said yea.
You know I feel terrible about this, I've been talking to Harold calls and says you
know hey have called this woman, have you talked to this woman. You must
forgive me, I have been quite busy and I explained to her what all was going on to
keep me from focusing on Brown. What I ended up doing. She was going to the
vineyard. Her parents have a house on the vineyard and subsequently she and her
husband bought a house on the vineyard. And my parents have a house on the
vineyard so we met down there. And you know she kind of excited me because once
again, she told me look we don't have much in place and you can be creative and
money and is not the issue. See when people tell me that that's a big difference
because that is what I was told before. And I used to get all the leg money from the
city of Boston to reinvest in my students. We had a logo, we had a theme every
year, we had a contest. You know when money is not an issue, you can be flagrant.
But anyway, she told me money wasn't an issue and you know any programming
ideas you have you know, we'll talk about them . But i want you to do something to
involve minority alums . So that's when I came to Brown . We came up with an
agreement and I packed my bags and said good-bye nasport and [blows kiss] hello
Brown. And during my tenure there I did I guess make some significant changes in
encouraging alums to return and one year I got a gold medal for alumni programs.
So and now I'm here as assistant dean of the college and director of the Third World
Center. And again, I have student contact which I love. I really do because I feel as
though I can enhance the quality of life for students of color while they're here. And
do those things that are positive and uplifting for them and helping them to be able
to go out in the world and do it.
DB: Ok, just one last question. I asked this of Dean English yesterday and she said
she couldn't really answer it, so. (KM laughs) I wanted to ask you. How do you feel
that race and gender have affected your advancement?
KM: That's a tough one. I don't know if I can answer that. Well, I don't want to
leave any question unanswered.

McLaurin-20

DB: I have some other questions I could ask you so you can have time to think
about it.
[End Tape 1, Side 2]
DB: I was looking in your yearbook and saw a section that said that it was supposed
to be on behalf of the class ...(KM: Which year?) It was '73. (KM: Oh. laughs) And it
was said that it was supposed to be a statement on behalf of the class and it said, "We
come from the suburbs and to the suburbs we will return." (KM: [shocked] I said
that?!) No, not you ... (KM: I was going to say, "Whew! Where'd that come from.
What's wrong with that foolish child?") I felt like maybe that was indicative of the
attitude of a lot of the students at Brown. (KM: Could you just tell me and I want to
know if it was somebody I knew.) Oh, I don't have the name but I could look it up
for you though.
KM: Ok, let me know. [pause] This is not what I call your ideal Brown African
American male or female statement. I recall Brown being service oriented. I recall
my community service as playing a role in the decision to accept me. And I would
never thrive to come from the suburbs and go back to the suburbs. That's so boring.
But some people do feel that way. I'm not frightened of the city . Every city to me
has some beautiful place and I just don't run away from things like that. But you
have to remember that Brown is made up of a number of people and a number of
different a tti tudes and as long as their space is not being infringed upon and they are
not silenced, then they are happy. You know.
DB: What was the racial climate like while you were at Brown?
KM: Well there was protesting in '73 . And most protests are around the same
issues. I do believe that racism is here to stay. And that we need a complete societal
washout (laughs) in order to make a different clima teo But at Brown I didn't find it
difficult. And that one racial problem I told you I had was with a professor but then
again I think he was a t.a. I'd like to think that it was either a La. or an assistant
teacher or professor. And this man was clearly racist and I could not stand to have
him talking that way. But you know you have to go through the dean's office before
you can move. There is a pipeline where if somebody is alleged to be racist, then
they do check it out. I...it was a very different environment in that African
American students did receive the ear of the administration . They were interested
in changing the environment in '68, or else they could have said to those people
who walked out, "Go on and keep walking!" You know, we don't need ya. But
they didn't. They cared about those students. And they did want them to come back
to school. And they did understand the gravity of their position. [pause] so I think
that racism will exist for a while. And I just hope and I don't believe our
administration is racist. I have a lot of hope and a lot of confidence in President
Gregorian that he'll do the right things to create safe space for our students of color. I
really do. So that's very you know it's a different attitude. It's a good healthy
attitude and he needs our support. You know, or you 'll see him waving good-bye

McLaurin-21

too. (laughs) you know.
DB: Packing his bags . (KM: Yea, right.) When you were here...Oh, there is always
an time when issues of minority students and minority faculty and increasing the
number of both had been a big issue. And in an attempt to justify the small numbers
is that the people who are here are the only qualified people out there. That the
blacks at Brown were the only ones qualified enough to be Brown students. And I
was wondering if you as faculty or while you went here that if the university geared
you toward that?
KM: No. Let me say this . I know ... I have no illusion about my rendezvous with
Brown. Again, I think that what is very real here is that I was given an opportunity.
And part of being given tha t opportunity - I wish I could remember this woman's
name in the admissions office, it's not anybody who we've talked about thus far ­
she was so thoughtful. She was very warm and she was honest. You know and she
left Brown. By the time I got here, she was gone. She admitted her class and said,
see you later, you know? But and I feel very bad about that because I would love to
have had the opportunity to say thank you for this opportunity and guess what?! In
order to try to show my good faith, I graduated in three years (laughs) you know.
But I didn't have that luxury of being able to tell her that. But one thing that she did
say was, ''I'm going to give you the opportunity. It's going to be up to you to make
good of it." You know . And I venture to say that I made good of it. And that my
Brown experience was warm enough for me to want to be here and to offer support
to students as I was given support, you know. Not in such a paternalistic fashion,
but you know I wanted our students of color to know that somebody's here who
cares. There are other people who are here who care too but I don't I know that I am
very different than my colleagues. And that's what make us unique.
DB: Now we're back to the big question. (KM: Ok, now I'm with you. laughs)
How has race and gender affected your advancement at Brown or your experience at
Brown as an administra tor?
KM: Ok, I would, alright, when I first came to Brown, I came to fill a minority
position. I doubt seriously that the director of alumni relations, Heidi Janes, would
hire a white person to encourage to minority alumnis to be part of the to be active.
So I know that that had something to do with it. And now when you talk about
your advancement up the Brown professional ladder? that's different. I'm not a
vice-president. I think that you know deans, people of administrative standing, but
I don't know that I'd want to be a dean of the college. I don't think that's what I
really want to do. And it's not that I just "vant to horde my experience and my good
will to students of colors because - of color - because I do ha ve white ad visees. There
are students - you're not going to believe thi s - that I don't even know how they got
to me, but come to my door to you knmv help them on issues - academic issues or it
could be working on a project. But they come. I feel as though I have a lot more
work to do here before I could be considered before I could be at peace to move on to
another position. You know, I have work to do and I haven't quite completed the

McLaurin-22

goals that I set for this position . So once I do and once we have a class of just happy
people, then until then, (laughs) my job's not done.
DB: Ok, that's it. Thank you very much.
