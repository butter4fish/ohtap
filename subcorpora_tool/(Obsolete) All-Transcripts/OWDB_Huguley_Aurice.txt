 Kite  It   s February 16, 2001. We are in Norman, Oklahoma speaking with Aurice  Huguley. Since I ran across you in such an odd way, I really don   t have much  background on your life. Have you lived in Oklahoma all of your life?  Yes, started out in Beaver, out in the panhandle, the easternmost of the three  panhandle counties, and then when I finished high school I moved to Alva to  go to school, and after I graduated I stayed on and worked at the university for  43 years.  So you lived in Beaver county until you were around 18, and then you moved  to Alva, for a lot longer time than I expect you thought you were going to be  there, and then making your way slowly south and east.  I moved down here, to Norman; my niece lived here, and she invited me to  come, and I guess I thought when you didn   t work eight hours a day it was  hard to find enough to do in Alva. Boy, there   s plenty to do in Norman.  Yeah, it   s a good town to live in.  And you know, people will say to me,    You don   t seem to mind driving over  to Oklahoma City.    The idea is that when you   ve lived two and a half hours  from Oklahoma City all your life it   s just wonderful to be 30 minutes away.  When we went to Boise City we had people coming in from north Texas,  southern Kansas; you know, driving two hours, like you say   it   s just part of  the everyday life.  Well, yeah, if you   re going to live there you get used to it, and it doesn   t seem  like anything remarkable.  Right, we thought that we were really imposing on them when we found out  how far they were driving. They said oh no, it   s not a big deal. Well, when  were you born?  1919.  So when you moved to Alva then, it was    37?  5  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley     36.  So you had kind of experienced what most people would say is the worst of the  storms already.  Well, yeah. That summer of 1936 was really terrible; it was hot. There  weren   t so many dust storms, but the heat was just immense, 120. It set the  record for that area.  Was that in Alva?  In Alva.  Where abouts in Beaver county were you?  Beaver.  Right in Beaver. I just found out that   s the oldest published newspaper in  Oklahoma.  Is that right?  Yeah, and it   s still going on. I forgot what it   s called. The Beaver...  The Herald Democrat.  And it   s the oldest continuously published newspaper in the state.  Well, good for them.  Yeah, I don   t think they knew it. I called them to see if they were still printing,  and I don   t think they knew that they were the oldest.  Is that right? Well, I   ve known the newspaper editors for a long time.  So you were in Beaver when it was setting heat records, or had you moved to  Alva at that point?  Well, I didn   t move to Alva until that Fall, but it was that hot in Beaver, too.  Were you involved in a farming family?  No, we never did farm, but my dad was a grain elevator manager. So how the  farmers fared made a big difference to us.  You were just as connected as if you had been farming. Did you live in town?  Yes, we always lived in town, but you know, town was a thousand.  6  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Right, it   s a different kind of town. Do you remember the first presence of  something different coming through, when you realized we are in the dust  bowl, or we are in a depression? Do you remember something that kind of  told you or happened in your mind that made you aware that things are  different now?  It had always been pretty windy. You don   t call it wind out there, you call it  breeze. It   s always been windy. So it wasn   t until the big old clouds billowed  in that we could realize that this was more than a breeze.  The    35 dust storm in particular, is that what you   re talking about?  Well, the    35 was the worst one. That April    35 was the one where it was clear  black for some long time. I guess I can   t remember how long, but it feels like  it was a quarter of a day. That one was the granddaddy of them all. The  clouds would billow in. It was pretty much like a tornado cloud, except  instead of it being a rain cloud, it was full of dust, and it rolled in like a  tornado cloud. It came billowing in, it didn   t just turn gradually.  Some people that we have spoken with mark that day as, in their mind, the  beginning of that period. Some people say no.  No, the period was before that. That was kind of the crowning glory rather  than the beginning. There was a lot after that, but there had been a lot before  that.  In your mind, was that the beginning of the Depression for that area as well,  or was that later, before?  You know, one of my friend   s dads was saying,    I wouldn   t mind having 25  cent wheat if I just had some.    See what that says to you? The Depression  was terrible, but the drought and the dust storms were worse.  He wouldn   t have minded the low price?  He could have put up with the low price if he just had some to sell. The wind  and the dust would blow the wheat right out of the ground. It   d be sprouted,  and it   d still blow it right out of the ground.  Your father was the elevator manager; did he run it?  Yes, he was the manger, but you know, (Laughs) the manager was the staff  too.  How did that affect your life? If the farmers were going down, how did that  affect the grain elevators?  He worked on salary, so it didn   t affect us that much. It   s amazing what the  money comparison was then to what it is now. I remember working my way  7  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  through college at 15 cents an hour. My great nephew goes to school down in  Dallas, and is a computer whiz kid. He gets forty dollars an hour. (Laughs) I  don   t even tell him my story because his mind won   t conceive that.  I am not familiar with the pay scale, was the grain elevator manager a fairly  good job?  Any job was a good job to have. But yes, it was medium, I believe I   d say.  Not really good, but not just subsistence either.  Did you have any brothers or sisters?  A brother and a sister, both younger.  So you were the oldest. Were they a lot younger than you?  No, my brother is three years younger, and my sister four and a half years  younger.  You were still the head of the children, but not by much.  Well, right, we were all little at the same time, all pre-schoolers at once.  Right. Well, in the town of Beaver would you say that you were on the upper  end of society, or middle, or     No.  Were a lot of your friends affected more than you by the dust?  My best friend was. Her dad   s the one that could have put up with the price if  he   d had some. They lived on a farm in the southeast part of the county. Some  of those farmers had been prosperous farmers before the dust storm days. I  keep trying to think how they fared. I can   t recall an illustration of that.  Did any of your friends or acquaintances move away?  No. When they wanted us to move away, mostly nobody wanted to. They  were fiercely independent. And boy, we   d just stick it out; this has been good,  and it   ll be good again, so we   re not going to move away.  Do you think the people that left the dust bowl and headed for different areas  of the country, that Beaver county was not a good example of that?  No, I think that it didn   t have very many tenant farmers. It had been settled up  with claims, and people owned the land. It was their only asset, so they  weren   t going to go off and leave it. It wasn   t like that they were a tenant that  lost their job and had to go somewhere.  8  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Do you think it was mainly tenant farmers then that were comprising the     It feels like that. Well, owning the land was like a sacred trust, it was really  important so you didn   t give up on your land.  At that time, you would have had land for almost fifty years in your family.  My grandparents lived in Beaver county too, over in the southeast corner. And  boy, some of the devastation of the dust storms I can remember at their place.  Thistles, you know, tumbleweeds would blow into the fence row, and then that  would catch the dust, and by the end of the dust storm era there was no fence,  it was all buried. They also had a row of hedge apples that were about a  quarter of a mile long, and that worked the same way, it caught the dirt. Of  course, the trees died from the drought, but it wasn   t rich dirt like the deltas, it  was pure sand. If you   ve been to Beaver you know there are sand dunes on the  north side of the river. Every place is pretty sandy in that whole county. The  sand moved pretty easy when the wind blew.  I got a great picture in a little gully of railroad tracks covered up with sand.  They had to haul in a big crane, big earth shovels, to scoop out the sand, it  moved so fast. Your grandparents must have a hard time making it through  being a little older out in a pure farming area.  Let   s see, my granddad died pretty early on, he died before the Depression  started, the dust storms. And my grandmother pretty early on moved into town  and lived next door to us.  Well, living in town during that period, and growing up there, could you  describe a typical day? What you   d go through. Did you have chores? What  were your tasks around the house?  We had two jersey cows. There was a vacant lot next to us, and they didn   t  have zoning. We had cows, but I never did learn to milk. The bad truth is that  my dad was a chronic alcoholic, and those were the days they didn   t do  anything for them. Boy, you just survived. I   d always think that if he had to  come home to milk the cows, he   d get home and he wouldn   t be out getting  drunk. But you know, that was just one of my childhood fancies. So I had a  hang up with learning to milk the cows.  So you didn   t learn to milk the cows, almost on purpose so your dad would  have to come home.  Yes, on purpose, so he   d have to come home. When he didn   t come home  mother milked the cows because that was one of our main sources of income,  selling the milk.  Did you have any chores around the house? Were there things that you had to  get done during the day?  9  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  My memory   s not that good. I don   t believe I can recall that.  Do you remember any changes in household duties once the dirt picked up? A  lot more cleaning?  Oh yeah. Boy, until I was a senior in high school, we lived in just a four-room  house, and it was pretty poorly insulated.  One story? Four rooms?  Yeah, pretty near a shotgun. Two rooms at the front, and two rooms built on  at the back. The dirt just filtered in there like you would never believe. We  didn   t have water in or water out. You had to bring it in in a bucket from a  faucet out in the yard.  Heat it up if you wanted hot water? I can   t imagine trying to keep things  clean.  You couldn   t. A lot of people wore dust masks   has anybody talked to you  about that? If you had the money, you bought some special fabrics. Mainly it  just covered your nose and mouth, and then had strings that you tied up on the  back, and so you slept with a dust mask.  I   ve never heard anyone say that. I   ve heard people say you cover your mouth  when you were doing sweeping and stuff, but you actually put them on when  you were sleeping? I   ve heard some stories of ceilings caving in, and all kinds  of bizarre events.  I guess I don   t remember the ceilings caving in, but boy; keeping ahead of the  dust was a full time job.  Doing house cleaning with a shovel   My description is that you had to clean the oven before you could bake your  biscuits.  Were you in charge of doing laundry, or did your mother take care of that?  Or ironing?  I ironed. She mostly did the laundry. Maybe we couldn   t do it to suit her.  But she let you do the ironing?  Yes.  Did you heat the iron on the stove?  Uh-huh, flat irons they called them.  10  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Did you ever use a gasoline iron?  No, my aunt did, but we didn   t.  I   ve seen those before, and they always look like they   re just getting ready to  explode.  Well, I don   t know whether they were that dangerous or not. She didn   t think  they were. She got along with it all right. She wasn   t afraid of it.  I think I   d stick to the flat iron.  They cooled off really quick. You could keep going. You didn   t have to wait  for your iron to heat again. So you got through with your work a lot sooner  when you used a gasoline iron than when you used flat irons. But you always  had three flat irons, so two were getting hot while one was being used and  getting cold.  You just clip on to the hot one with the handle? You didn   t have water in or  out? And I   m guessing no electricity.  We did, strangely enough, have electricity, but I can   t imagine how we had  that when we didn   t have water in and out.  Do you remember getting electricity, or did you always have it?  No, I don   t remember ever not having it.  What about running water? Do you remember when you first encountered     We moved to a different house clear across town. It had running water. In  that little house where we lived the whole time, we didn   t ever have water in or  water out.  So when you moved to a different house in town you had running water at that  point. Do you remember what you were thinking the first time?  (Laughs) We felt pretty deluxe.  I can   t imagine having to   we take it for granted so much now. You brush  your teeth and wash your face.  Let the faucet run while you brush your teeth.  Yes, and don   t think a thing about it. It must have been quite a change.  Well it made you feel like better days were coming.  What about things you would do for entertainment or fun during your time in  11  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Beaver?  I had several really good friends, and we   d hang out together, but we didn   t go  to the movies much. We didn   t have the money. The movies were a dime, but  you didn   t have a dime.  Right, it didn   t matter how cheap it was if you didn   t have that much money.  Right.  So on a lazy Saturday afternoon what would you do to entertain yourself?  I must have done something, but I don   t remember. It must have been  something pretty mundane. I   m not very good at remembering details.  What about dances?  American Legion always had a dance. They had a dance every week, but we  weren   t allowed to go.  You couldn   t go.  I couldn   t go.  For any particular reason?  No.  Mom wouldn   t let it or was it dad the one who wouldn   t let you go?  Well, dad thought it was no place for a reputable person to be. He   d be there.  He was a Legion member, and so he was supposedly helping put on the dance.  Well he might know then if it truly was a place you didn   t need to be.  Well, yeah. See it was prohibition days, and liquor flowed plenty free. That  put him in a position to imbibe without being observed by family members.  Oh, I see. I didn   t think about it being prohibition. How did your dad go  about getting his alcohol?  (Laughs) Bootleggers.  Did he keep that fairly hidden from the family?  Yes, it wasn   t something he was proud of at all. His sister described it as,     When he smelled the cork, he was gone.    Once he smelled it he couldn   t quit     til he was drunk.  12  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  So it was fairly easy to obtain liquor in that place at least. I didn   t think about  that. When you mentioned that earlier I didn   t put two and two together, about  the bootleggers. Sometimes people out in the panhandle tell stories about  running into gypsies. Did you ever encounter any of those?  Hobos, people that were down and out, would come to the door a lot. We must  have had a mark because mother wouldn   t turn them away. See, she always  had milk, and that helped a lot. If she couldn   t give them anything else, she  could give them a glass of milk.  Do you know what hobo marks look like?  No, I just hear about them.  I hear a lot about them, and I wish I could find out what they look like.  I guess I had always thought that it was kind of a word of mouth thing that  traveled as fast as your two ladies rescheduling the thing. I guess I didn   t  really conceive that it was something that was a literal mark.  I   ve heard that they would often mark a telephone pole or a tree or something  by a house that was either good or bad, that they would have some sort of  weird little sign or something.  I hadn   t thought about that. I guess I just was so sure that it was a word of  mouth thing that I discounted it.  Did you live by a railroad yard, or by a major highway?  No, there wasn   t much of either one. See, the main railroad went by Forgan, a  little town seven miles north of Beaver. The railroad that came on down there  was just to pick up the grain in harvest season. They didn   t have a real rail  service there.  Since your mother never turned them away, do you remember your mother  ever making them do work or chores?  Well, I remember their offering. I don   t remember that she necessarily always  had a job for them to do.  Were you afraid of them?  No. They just seemed like people like us only we   d been a little luckier than  they.  Well, what about holiday memories? What all would you do for Christmas?  We went to the grandparents a lot, and then two of my dad   s brothers lived,  one about six or eight miles from the grandparents, and the other one just  13  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  about a mile and a half from them. So that   s what we   d do on Sundays a lot, is  go to one of those three farm homes. We always had a car.  You remember growing up with a car then.  Yeah. You didn   t need a driver   s license. You just drove when you were big  enough to do it.  When you could reach the pedals  Well, do you remember your Christmas  changing at all as the times worsened, as things got a little tight maybe? Do  you remember a change in the way you would celebrate, or a change in the  way dinner was made?  I guess I hadn   t thought on it enough to have an opinion about it. There was  always a Christmas program at the church, and dad was always the one that  dressed up in the Santa Claus suit. He enjoyed getting dressed up, and then  going around to shut-ins and people that weren   t going to be at the church, and  then ended up at the church at about the right time to do his ho ho ho stunt.  What a great job.  But anyway, that was kind of fun. I first realized who Santa Claus was when I  recognized my dad   s hands because they were pretty unique.  What was unique about your dad   s hands?  Well, just the shape and the form, and well, they weren   t knarled like mine.  You   d know his hands anywhere.  You were looking at Santa Claus and looked down.  And here are dad   s hands. But I don   t remember feeling upset about it.  Maybe part of it was because I could realize that he enjoyed what he was  doing that much.  What a great thing to have a Santa Claus for a dad  (Laughter) Well, then you  moved away to Alva when you were 17. How was that for you?  Well, that seemed like the big city, and that was 7,000, but that was seven  times bigger than Beaver. It didn   t take too long though for Alva to feel  comfortable. My friend that I mentioned, the one whose dad could put up with  the price, came with me. I had the promise of a NYA  National Youth  Administration  job when I went over to school, but she went without a  promise of any job. The first year that we were in college she cleaned houses  to earn her way, at 15 cents an hour.  What was your NYA job?  I worked at one of the agricultural offices down at city hall for that first year,  14  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  and then the next year I worked for the professor that was the director of the  NYA doing time sheets and all that sort of thing. Then the third year I worked  at the Registry Business Office at the school, and then that   s where I worked  after I got out of college.  So you just stayed on.  Yeah.  So you were able to pay for your schooling and room and board with the NYA  job?  Yes,  15 a month paid everything.  Well that   s not bad. So your friend just came with you hoping that she would  find a job?  She just had more faith than I did. I can   t account for it. She had gone to  school down in Texas or some place close by her home, and had been out of  school a year or two before she came up to Beaver to school.  You mentioned the NYA job, which was a New Deal program. You were  probably old enough at that time, in Beaver and Alva, to perceive the New  Deal and how it was accepted or rejected in that area.  Dad was such a hotheaded democrat that he wouldn   t think that FDR  Franklin  D. Roosevelt  could do any wrong. Pretty much what he thought was what we  heard; that maybe colored what we thought. But I thought it was well  accepted because we were all up against it, and at least FDR tried to do  something. Before, there was no effort to help you. It was just sad that you  were in a predicament, but there   s nothing I can do to help your predicament.  So he came across as being a good guy to obviously your dad and to you as  well.  Yeah, I sometimes think maybe dad would have supported anybody that was a  democrat. Boy, you sat there by the radio and listened to FDR, you could  think that he   s got some ideas that are going to work. But you know, when  you   re tied to agriculture, and we were, there was nothing else. The oil play  out there, that they have now, wasn   t. It was agriculture or nothing. When  they came up with wanting to slaughter the cattle because there was an over  supply, that sounded illogical. We didn   t know enough about supply and  demand that we could realize what the relationship really was.  When talking about Roosevelt it seems like most people I   ve spoken with, they  either thought like your dad did or they thought he was the devil, there   s no  middle ground. (Laughter) I   ve run into both sides.  I   m sure those that couldn   t see supply and demand, and had to plow up their  15  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  plants. Before that they couldn   t even grow any, and then when they grew  some they had to plow them up. See that sounded like utter futility, so I could  see how there would be people like that. But see, the worst of the drought was  beginning to be over by the time they were ready to do that part of it. To me,  the drought and the dust storms were earlier than that. Let   s see, it was 1933  that Roosevelt was inaugurated. Yeah, 1933. Well, that   s not quite right  because boy, those dust storms still went on for two or three more years.  He came in in March of    33, and then    34,    35,    36 the big heat wave. I   ve  never spoken to anyone who remembered his fireside chats. What did you  think about those?  I   m surprised because I don   t think that was just a matter of being brain  washed, and thinking that I   d believe like my dad did. I thought his method of  presentation was good, that he made you feel like your problems were his  concern, and that you weren   t just a grain of sand. You were a real person that  needed somebody to open the door and let you out of that situation. So I  thought his tone of voice and his whole presentation, besides the words he  said, were reassuring. And man you needed some reassurance.  You  may  think this is an odd question, but I   m thinking of it so I   ll ask it. Do  you think that there   s ever been a president since him that made you feel that  way?  Not to the extent that he did. I think there have been some that made it feel  like they were a person like you, and not somebody high and mighty that you  can   t aspire to even speak to.  The only one that I could think of in my lifetime that I can remember being like  that would be Jimmy Carter.  Yeah, I thought he did, and Harry Truman wasn   t bad. You probably can   t  remember Harry Truman  No, not by a few years. Were the fireside chats regularly scheduled?  No, I don   t think it was like every Tuesday or anything like that. It was  anytime when he was ready to promote a new program. He   d do his own  advertising in a fireside chat. So you knew when it was coming up.  Would you say the radio was a focal point for you?  It was your only connection to the outside world.  Did you have favorite things to listen to? Were there favorite news programs,  like Good Morning America or the five o   clock news?  Let   s see, Edward R. Murrow was about that time. It paid you to listen to what  he had to say, but I believe we used it more for entertainment and comedy  16  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  things rather than keeping up with the news. I think we were probably just  pretty much just a cocoon. We didn   t realize there was a world out there. It  was just what our immediate problems were right there at home.  It   s still kind of like that out there. You know, you get out in the panhandle,  and you have a little town that   s surrounded by     It   s just kind of self-contained, that   s what it is, and you know, that   s not  negative.  That   s just a fact of life.  Yeah, that   s just the way it is.  My dad always used to listen to Amos and Andy, I guess. He was always  talking about Amos and Andy, doing their voices. I don   t know what he   s  talking about.  I don   t believe I can tell you the names.  Do you remember sitting in front of the radio listening to it though?  Yeah, our radio was pretty close to the potbellied stove. You could stay warm  and listen at the same time.  Laughs   Was that your source of heat for the four-room house? That big cast iron  potbellied stove? Did you have to stock it up with   ?  Coal. Are you kidding, there   s not enough trees that you could burn them.  I realize my mistake  So you would stock it up with coal, and would it last the  whole night through or would you have to get up in the middle of the night?  Oh no, you got up in the morning and built the fire. It didn   t last all night.  Did it heat the whole house?  No  It heated one room.  In the wintertime would you all be in that one room or would you go out and  sleep under blankets in different rooms?  We went out and slept in other rooms, but you didn   t have heat.  I   m guessing in the one room it got fairly warm.  It   d burn one side and freeze the other side. It didn   t keep you very cozy.  What about when you moved to the other house, was it better?  17  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Well, it had a furnace, a floor furnace, in the big main living room part. Boy,  there wasn   t any heat back there in those other rooms.  Well, when you moved to Alva to go to school did you live in the dorms at  school?  Well, they didn   t have dorms then. We lived in the basement of a home that  rented the room to us.  Do you remember how much you paid for that?  Well, I can   t remember that one. I can remember a later one that we paid  5 a  month a piece.  So  10 for two of you to live. Would you be responsible for your own food and  things?  Yeah, you called it a lighthouse keeping room.  What would that entail?  Oh, that you had a little hot plate and most of the time you   d have an oven. It  was just what you   d call batching.  Well when you went to Alva did you go there with something in mind to study?  Oh, I changed my mind two or three times, but I thought I wanted to be a  home demonstration agent because to me that opened doors of opportunity. I  guess that   s always been really important to me. You know, you have to have  a chance, and then if you have a chance hope that you   re smart enough to  recognize it and take hold of it.  Were home demonstration agents connected to the county? And they would  come through and just describe for a group of women different ways to can or  sew. Kind of like a traveling home economics teacher, right?  Well, they didn   t travel so much as they established clubs and would go out  and visit with your whole club. When your club had a meeting then the agent  would come out and put on a demonstration.  Where you a member of a club in Beaver?  I never was a member of the club. I saw it from the outside instead of the  inside.  So you didn   t go to any of these home demonstration meetings?  No.  18  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  But when you came to Alva you thought it would be a good thing to do?  Well, it just seemed to me that was a leader for something progressive.  Who went to these meetings?  Housewives. Hardly anybody worked outside the home then.  Was it more rural than in the city?  Well, see, we weren   t city. We were rural. So it probably wasn   t as important  in urban areas.  Some people would probably say you were city. Some farmers way out there  in the middle of nowhere. So then did you become a home decoration agent?  No, I majored in home economics, but I didn   t ever use it. I used business  instead.  Did you ever finish school?  Yes.  With a business degree?  With a home ec degree and a business minor. Then business is what I did the  whole time.  When you moved to Alva, do you remember thinking that the drought and the  Depression had not affected it as much since it was a bigger city?  Well, I think everybody that went to school when we did came from the same  mold. I was talking with some of my friends at an alumni affair, and they were  the ones calling that to my attention. They thought that the reason we learned  to support each other was that we all came from the same basic background.  We didn   t have anybody that was elite. We were all populous. I think that   s  pretty much the way it really was. There wasn   t anybody that was head and  shoulders above the rest of us.  Well, what was your school day like in Alva?  Well, classes in the forenoon and work in the afternoon.  Work in your WPA job?  Yeah, NYA.  Did you have time for college activities and events?  19  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Oh yeah, you did that in the evening. (Laughter)  What all would happen? What all would you do? What was there for  entertainment or diversion there?  Well, mostly group things, meetings with your friends. I belonged to the  International Relations Club; I liked the professor that sponsored it. I went out  for college debate, and thought I could learn to do that. Then we had inter-mural  athletics. And we had YWCA. There were a lot of activities going on.  What athletics did you play?  Basketball, but I never was good at it. I just met the specification of being tall.  Right, so they put you out there. Well, do you remember any event or  something that happened in your mind that kind of signaled to you that things  were getting better perhaps? Were you able to afford something or did  something happen in town or at school that brought to your mind    oh things  are picking up again.     Boy, I don   t remember that. It seemed to me like it was close to the skin the  whole time that things didn   t pick up actually until after World War II.  Yeah, that would have been in    41.     41 is when the war began, and everybody was structured down at that time,  with the rationing and things like that. I'm talking like    46, like ten years later.  So you   re saying that you don   t really recall what you would call prosperous  times or good times coming until    46. So you went from bare bones Beaver     I   d been away from Beaver ten years before I could realize there was anything  other than tomorrow. You don   t see day after tomorrow, just tomorrow.  When do you remember realizing there was a day after tomorrow?  (Laughs) Well, I think maybe that   s a little too strong. What I   m saying is  that if you had food today you didn   t worry about tomorrow.  Right, just one day at a time. So when did it become better for you? I mean,  after the war?  Well, that   s probably too strong. But see, it was up to me to earn all my own  way, and that probably isn   t what all of society was doing. I think whole  society was getting along better than that. I was still glad to have a NYA job.  When did that end? When you ended school?  Yes, I don   t think the program ended then, but, I don   t know when the  20  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  program ended.  At the time that you got out of school you continued basically doing the same  job?  Right.  Your pay go up a tad?  Well, let   s see. Yeah, I started working at  70 a month, working full time.  Working full time,  70 a month.  In that time period, I   m just assuming you were married.  No, single.  Always single? You never met the     Anybody I liked didn   t like me.  (Laughs) Wow, you are different. You don   t fit the mold.  Well, maybe not.  So, you lived in Alva for 43 years after that? You must have seen the city  change drastically.  Well, and the school changed drastically too. See, I was the finance officer.  That was the title. Now the job is called the vice-president for business affairs.  They got a little more fancy didn   t it  What year did you leave Alva?     83.  So you really saw some changes in that town. Can you describe, a little bit,  the difference between being there as a bare bones just out of college student  and then post war prosperity? Can you talk a little bit about the difference?  I hadn   t really thought on that.  Was there any difference for you? Was your life different after the war when  things boosted up a little bit?  Well, yeah. Take a bunch of sorority girls and go to a national convention in  Detroit, and you wouldn   t have thought about doing that at an earlier time. So  I   m sure there were some differences; it just takes you a little while to think  back over them. I guess I   m crazy in that regard too; how much money I have  doesn   t appeal to me. That isn   t the most important thing. I enjoy knowing a  lot of people more than I enjoy spending a lot of money.  21  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  So you were busy in Alva I take it, with different groups and things. Why did  you stay there?  Well, a sense of accomplishment I think. I think we did some things that made  a difference to people.  Did your parents always stay in Beaver?  Yes. My mom moved over to Alva, oh, the last two or three years.  And your dad lived in Beaver the rest of his whole life?  Yeah, it ended up in suicide.  Have you ever read a book called Life on the Dry Line?  No. It sounds like it   d be about hard times.  I think you   d either enjoy that book or not enjoy that book, but it is     Is it a new book?  No, it came out in, oh I   m gonna say    91 or    92. It sounds a lot like what  you   re telling me. This guy wrote that book, and I was so moved by that book  that I called him up. He lived in Oregon, and he grew up at the 115th  Meridian. It   s what they call the dry line, where beyond that point they  consider it arid or a desert like environment. To the east of that is semi-arid,  and that went right through the panhandle of Oklahoma, down right about  Beaver County. He lived in Kansas, and his house was on that dry line. His  dad ran a service station, and was also a bad alcoholic. He just talks about  growing up in a little tiny town on the dry line in that environment.  Well, I   ll look for it.  And when I read that book, and it   s all true, it   s all just his life, I  looked  on  the back of the book,  and  it said    the author now lives in Portland, Oregon.     I got out the phone book up at campus. I started looking and I called him up.  All right. I bet he fell dead.  Anyway, I think you   d really like it. Well, as kind of a closing question  sometimes we talked about strong memories. If you can think back to the  Depression and the thirties as a time period, are there certain memories or  events that stand out in your mind as symbolic of that era? When you say  Depression what is the first thing you think of?  Well, the people that lived next door to us. He didn   t have a job, and they got  really hungry. All we had to share with them was milk.  22  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  You gave them what you could.  We gave them what we had, which wasn   t very much. I don   t even remember  what happened to them. That one winter they were really hard up.  What would they do?  Do without until they were all near starvation.  Did the town collect things for people like that?  They didn   t have it either. You just can   t imagine what it   s like when you   re  tied to agriculture and there   s no agriculture. They didn   t have it; they  couldn   t give it to them. We were lucky that we could give them milk.  And you don   t know if they moved away?  I wish I could think of what happened to them, but I don   t know.  That   s a pretty profound memory.  Let   s you know if you   ve got something, you better share it.  What was a typical meal like for you?  We ate a lot of fried potatoes. My brother, that   s still his favorite thing. You  know, many times what you were reared on you don   t want anymore of it.  Right, you   re tired of it. But he still likes it, huh?  Yeah. While other people will talk about dried beans, well we didn   t have  dried beans very much, but boy we had potatoes a lot.  Would you have a garden that you grew those in or did you buy them?  We didn   t do very well with gardens. I don   t know what the matter of it was.  Maybe some of it was that water business. You can   t grow a garden without  water. We finally fixed up a makeshift showerhead out in the garage, and  made a little hole in the wall of the garage so it could drain out into the garden.  That was the best garden I can ever remember having. So we didn   t do very  well with gardens. Dad wasn   t there. Gardening was the last thing he was  going to be interested to do.  So you ate a lot of potatoes. Was meat a fairly common thing on your table?  Beef. We   d buy a quarter of beef at a time, and it   d have to last about all  winter. I still like beef better than I do pork or chicken or any other thing.  How odd that you didn   t get tired of it. What do you think about fried potatoes  23  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  now?  Well, I don   t have them very often. (Laughs) Maybe it   s just because I think  that they   re not quite as wholesome as baked potatoes. I   d rather have a baked  potato than a fried potato.  Do you still stay in contact with people from Alva or Beaver that you met as a  young girl?  Yeah, I was thinking that I ought to tell you who you should go see. One of  my classmates lives at Tulsa, and I think he   d be a good one to talk to you  about the dust storm days.  Well, I   m going to send you a release form that allows us to use your tape at  the Library. It allows people to listen to your tape. Without the release form  people can   t listen to it.  I don   t object to that.  Maybe when I send that to you, you can write down some people that would be  interested in speaking.  My friend with the 25 cent wheat lives out in Dalhart, Texas. In Guymon  they   re not very far from Dalhart. I sent her the clipping that I got out of the  Norman paper, and told her that I wish that she   d write to you and tell you that  she   d like to talk to you about dust storm days. I guess her health   s not as  good as mine; I didn   t much think she   d do it, but I sure wanted her to.  Does she live in a nursing home there?  No, I think she lives with her son.  I wonder if she would know more people in Dalhart that had lived in  Oklahoma.  Well, we could ask her. She lived in Canyon until she needed to go live closer  to her son.  We   re going to be in Guymon for three or four days.  Oh are you?  Guymon, Goodwell, Hooker, that area. I know we could go down to Dalhart.  Let me go get her address, I might even have her phone number.  We were going to go up to Liberal, Kansas too. But really we are trying to  focus on women who lived in Oklahoma.  24  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  She lived in Oklahoma during that time. Well, after the war, they lived in  Texas, but always in the panhandle of Texas.  Well, I   m going to send you the release form and then you can write down  information.  When is it you   re going to Guymon? Like PDQ  pretty darn quick  or in a  little while?  Sort of PDQ. I think it might be in April. The second Thursday of April, but  probably Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. We have to give a little talk at the  museum.  I think her son could find somebody that would bring her up there.  That   d be great.  Well, at least I   d like to suggest that to her.  When we do places like that we usually try to get the people together in groups  of three or four.  I bet she   d like that better, too.  A lot of women do like that better because their friends can be with them.  What someone else says generates thoughts of your own.  Things   like in this conversation   you forgot to talk about and I forgot to ask  about could have been brought up by other people. We got completely off the  topic of things that you remembered strongly.  I   m not going to be able to come up with much.  That family next door story was pretty perfect.  To see people really destitute and really hungry right next door is pretty  unnerving.  What else was on your note list? You were talking about the difference  between the WPA and the PWA. Then we have the NYA. (Laughs)  Oh, dust pneumonia. One of my friends had dust pneumonia, and boy she  buckled under really quick. Considering how much exposure there was to it, I  guess it   s amazing that there wasn   t more of it. They didn   t have antibiotics,  so if you got dust pneumonia you were in bad shape.  Did anyone in your family ever get it  dust pneumonia ?  25  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  No, I guess we   re just a healthy bunch. When we were kids I guess we had kid  things, but we all grew up pretty healthy.  Your friend that had it, did she pass away?  Yeah, when she was in the eighth grade. I guess I was a year ahead of her, but  she was in the eighth grade when she got dust pneumonia and died. There was  quite a bit of dust pneumonia, but boy they worked at it, trying to keep it from  going into pneumonia. Out at Beaver they had just built a new hospital before  the crash. 1929 is when that hospital opened. These two doctors came; they  had done their intern work up at Halstead Hospital in Kansas, and came down  to this new hospital. Of course they were anxious to keep up a good  reputation, and they did us all a good job. One of my uncles moved over to  Vinita when he retired, and when he got sick the doctor wanted him to go into  Tulsa to see a specialist. Independent cuss that he is said,    I   m going back out  to Beaver. Doctor Ben and his butcher knife can do me more good than those  specialists can.    (Laughter)  They must have been good.  Well in his eyes they couldn   t be beat, but I always thought that illustrated  how fiercely independent they could be.  That   s loyalty. You had a hospital right there in Beaver. That   s pretty lucky.  And they still do, and that   s amazing that it can survive.  A lot of people talk about having to drive for an hour to get to a doctor, you  know. Beaver seems like a fairly progressive town.  Yeah, I think it is. It   s never going to be a bigger town than it is, but I think it  has some good local leadership.  What about childhood illnesses, do you remember any?  I can   t remember being sick very much. I   d get tonsillitis really easy. And I   d  get bruises on my heel, foot bruises. I can   t remember getting any bad colds  other than tonsillitis.  Do you remember any medicines you had to take or things you would do to  stop from being sick?  No.  Remedies?  Oh, my mom had a lot of home remedies. She thought bread and milk poultice  was going to do everything.  26  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Bread and milk poultice.  It just kept the injury moist and so your natural immune system could have a  chance to work because it kept the infection moist.  So you mixed the milk and bread up into like a paste almost? Then you would  put it on your body?  Well, on an infection, not for pneumonia. Like an infected heel.  Kind of wrap it up and let it sit there?  Yeah, make a big sock and hold it on there. It worked because it kept it moist,  and she put the poultice on hot. Warmer than your skin, not hot, hot.  I   ve never heard of that mixture before.  Let   s see, what they did when you got a cold and your chest congestion   lard,  coal oil and turpentine, a third of each one. That   s what you rubbed on your  chest. You didn   t go out and buy some medicine because you didn   t have any  money.  Sounds like you just go to the cupboard and pick something up. I talked to a  lady whose mom would go out under the house, under the barn, shoot a skunk,  render that skunk lard down, and make skunk oil, skunk oil poultice. She said  at night they would smear skunk fat, skunk grease on the bottom of their feet,  and they would sleep with that on their feet throughout the night.  Apparently it encouraged circulation or something.  Yeah, I don   t know.  I don   t know either, it sounds pretty gross to me.  She said they didn   t have any friends (Laughter) for the longest time.  That   d be for apparent reasons, wouldn   t it?  She said that when mom got the skunk fat out that they would be absent for a  while.  I   d be afraid it smelled like skunk   It did. So you should be lucky with your bread and milk.  Yeah, bread and milk didn   t stink, or at least it didn   t until the milk soured.  Well, so you sound like you had pretty typical concoctions to deal with things,  but you didn   t really need them if you didn   t get sick.  27  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Huguley  Kite  Well, when worse came to worse you went over to the hospital. They did you  a good job.  You weren   t afraid to go to the hospital?  No, not really. They didn   t come off as booger men.  Right, a lot of times even to an older child they do. Doctors have a bad     Have a bad connotation.  I used to get tonsillitis; my doctor would give me a big old penicillin shot, and  it hurt so bad that for a long time I   d always think if I   m going to the hospital  or doctor, it   s going to hurt.  Yeah, it was going to be a shot, and you hated them. I still hate shots myself.  Well, anything else you would like to wrap up with?  Oh, I don   t think so. I think we   ve covered all the bases I had in mind.  If you can think of something else, some story, even if it   s a small story     Okay, I   ll think on it some more. I guess I keep my presence so crowded I  don   t have room enough to think about how it use to be.  Yeah, well I guess that   s good or bad, I don   t know. It   s probably better that  you keep your mind focused on what   s going on around you today than  dwelling on the past. But if you remember something, a lot of people give us a  call. We can call them right back; we can call you right back on our nickel,  and talk to you. I   m here often enough that I could drop by again or whatever.  Well, I   ll think on it a little bit. My sister   s better than I am at recalling things,  details of long ago. I   ll have to ask her some family stories.  Okay.  -------  -------
