Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Fillmore Freeman, capital F-I-L-L-M-O-R-E, capital F-R-E-E-M-A-N.
Speaker 1: All right, and is there a story behind your last name.  The way you said it implies that there is a story behind it.
Speaker 2: We do not know that as a family, but we thought that maybe when the slaves were freed, some of them start saying "I'm a free man" or something like that.  But we have no documentation of that.
Speaker 1: It's a pretty good guess though.  And it's something that your family embraces?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and do you have a middle name?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, sir, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: April 10, 1936, Lexington, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, sir, what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: Professor of Chemistry.
Speaker 1: Okay, at U-C, Berkeley--
Speaker 2: At the University of California, Irvine.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and what is today's date?
Speaker 2: November 27, 2012.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: In my office in the chemistry department at the University of California, Irvine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23711
Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five, lightweight questions we always ask as kind of a warm up.  And they only require a short answer.  The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: No specific favorite food, but I like good food that's well prepared in general.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Probably two, but probably blue and earth tones, brown, tans, so, but when I was younger, blue was my favorite color.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: No, I enjoy all of the seasons, although in Southern California, we do not have really winter.  But since I grew up in a winter zone in Chicago [Illinois], then I enjoy living in Southern California which means I can drive for a few hours.  I can go skiing.  In a few hours, I can be at the beach.  So, this is sort of an ideal place to be.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No, I like to travel, but my favorite city is Paris [France], and I also like Berlin [Germany], also like Spain.  But traveling is on my agenda in the future.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, the last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Oh, probably several, but one is "The time before memories."
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and what does that refer to?
Speaker 2: It's more of a philosophical kind of question because if one wants to discuss the time before memories, it's not an easy thing to do.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 23712
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but we'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Ellen Meeks, capital E-L-L-E-N, capital M-E-E-K-S.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in Mississippi, but I do not know her date of birth.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you know, have any idea how old she was when you were born?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Do you suspect she was born after the turn of the century or--
Speaker 2: I do not know because she died when I was about five [years old], so I know very little about her because she had tuberculosis.  So we went, I think we were living in Chicago [Illinois].  And then we went back South to live with my maternal grandparents.  And she was, because tuberculosis is contagious or in those days, we called it a galloping tuberculosis because when people got it, they died very quickly.  So she resided in another house--structure on my grandparents' farm.  And so we used to just, we would go to the window just to talk to her sometimes, but it's very hard to remember all of that because I must have been around five years old.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So she died in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, but she contracted tuberculosis in Chicago?
Speaker 2: We do not know that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well, now, is there--what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side?  Are there any stories about them and where they came from and what their history is?
Speaker 2: No, we do not know any of the details because after my mother died, we had very little to do with my maternal grandparents.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you do know that your grandparents were farmers, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, (unclear) farmers.
Speaker 1: Did they own their own land or did they--
Speaker 2: Yes, they owned their own land, and, which was quite a bit of it.  They have a lot of land there in Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Now, is this in Lexington [Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: No, this is, well, I do not know.  It's close, it could be in Cruger, Mississippi or it could be in Lexington.  But it's around the area that's called Holmes County.  So, there are a lot of these little towns and townships.  I do not know the boundary lines, but all of these places are very close together.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so this is in rural Holmes County, Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Yes, Holmes County.  In fact, I was delivered by a midwife.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, so do you know your grandparents' names?
Speaker 2: No.  But I have some of my relatives looking for it, so I should have that in a few days I hope.  But I do not remember their names.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you know if your mother had a chance to finish school or--
Speaker 2: I know very little about mother, and after she died, we had no interaction with my mother's parents.
Speaker 1: Was she working in Chicago, do you know?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I'm three, four [years old] (laughter).  I do not know.
Speaker 1: Okay, I ask these specific questions because sometimes people remember a specific thing, but they take it for granted, you know, like, yes, sure, everybody works.  So why should I say that as something I know about her.  But that's something that we, you know--yeah, it's a clue, you know, and so.  So, do you know when your, how long your mother had been in Chicago before she--
Speaker 2: I do not know, but I remember that we're in Mississippi.  We went to Chicago, and then we went back to Mississippi when she was sick.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, but she, her first--was that her first trip to Chicago when you all came up when you were little?
Speaker 2: I believe so, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So that would have been about 1934 or '35 [1935], I guess?
Speaker 2: Well, I was born in 1936--
Speaker 1: Oh, '36 [1936], oh, I'm sorry. 1937 or '38 [1938], I guess.
Speaker 2: Right, um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23713
Speaker 1: All right. Well, let me ask about your father's side of the family.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Millard, capital M-I-L-L-A-R-D, Filmore, capital F-I-L-M-O-R-E, Freeman, F-R-E-E-M-A-N.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, he's named for one of the presidents of the United States, Millard Fillmore.
Speaker 2: The thirteenth president, yes.
Speaker 1: And is there a story behind that?
Speaker 2: No, except that in those days, many parents were naming their children after presidents.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so it wasn't a particular attachment to Millard Fillmore (laughter)?
Speaker 2: We (laughter) do not know.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  I'm laughing because it just seems, it would seem odd that anybody would have a particular attachment to Millard Fillmore in Mississippi in those days, you know, I don't know, but--
Speaker 2: Yes.  And also in general because he was probably the, one of the most do-nothing of all presidents.  He was very unspectacular.
Speaker 1: That's what's been said.  He was president in the 1850s or something.
Speaker 2: Somewhere around there, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  So, and what is your father's date of birth?
Speaker 2: I do not know.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have any suspicions about that in terms of his, his age when you were born or--
Speaker 2: I do not know, but I think I can find that information, but he was probably born in the early 1900s, I would guess.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where was your father born?
Speaker 2: In Mississippi.
Speaker 1: In the same--
Speaker 2: In the same general area, so it would probably be Tchula, which is right next to Lexington [Mississippi; Holmes County].
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what can you tell us about your father's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: Well, they were, well, my dad's parents were farmers also.  And they had, have a lot of land there in Mississippi.  But I do not know anything about what would be my great grandparents on my father's side.
Speaker 1: Okay, but your grandparents owned land too?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, in that same area in Holmes County?
Speaker 2: Yes, but this area was called Tchula [Mississippi].
Speaker 1: Okay, now, this is interesting.  Is there any story about how your grandparents acquired land in Mississippi in those days?
Speaker 2: I do not know how my mother's [Ellen Meeks] parents acquired land.  But relative to my father's parents, somehow or other they got some money.  They were buying acres of land for five or ten dollars.  And so their, the Freeman group and family and a number of other families bought up a lot of land right after, you know, slavery, I guess.  And so, consequently, they ended up with a great deal of land.  They had a lot of children.  Relatives had a lot of children, and all of them just grew up down there.  So it's a lot of land, and, in fact, we call part of it, the Albert Freeman Estate now which is heir property.  So, which simply means that if you're born a Freeman, then you automatically become an heir.
Speaker 1: Okay, so was your grandfather's name Albert Freeman?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Sally, S-A-, capital S-A-L-L-Y, Sally Freeman.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's interesting.  It's a different story than so many people we interview whose parents, you know, share-cropped, didn't own any land.  So it's always special when somebody, you know, black that, in the, from the South, you know, owned their own land 'cause we know it's not easy to get, first of all, and hold onto in places like Mississippi and Louisiana and other places.  So are there any stories about the dynamics of land ownership in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: As far as I know, they did not have any problems.  They farmed the land, raised large families, and many of their children, you know, got a section of the land, lived on there and started raising their families.  And so they were reasonably successful as farmers.
Story_ID: 23714
Speaker 1: Okay, now, this is Mississippi, now, and there're no stories of any conflict on this land at all?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, you know, in those days, it was strict segregation and either you stayed in your place or you got lynched.  And so to survive, they behaved and survived because when you listen to them tell stories and things, somebody is always getting beaten or the Ku Klux Klan would be riding by or even later on, I think, Emmett Till [African American boy who was murdered in Mississippi at the age of fourteen] was the lad who was beaten or lynched for irate, looking at a white woman the wrong way.  So the segregation was very strict, and there was no support for black people.  And white people did to them what they wanted to do.  So, you learn to stay alive.  So I think that's why they survived as well as they did.
Speaker 1: So they knew how to negotiate that community on some level, is what you're saying?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is Tchula [Mississippi] near Money [Mississippi] where Emmett Till was lynched?
Speaker 2: I do not know.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, he was lynched in Money, Mississippi.  I don't know the--I can't see the map in my head right now (laughter), Tchula [Mississippi]--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Neither can I.
Speaker 1: --to figure it out if it is.  But, so these stories, so they did tell these stories of what happened to other people who did not, who fell, you know, into conflict with them, the segregationist system?
Speaker 2: Oh, definitely, yes, yes.  And they would also tell stories about their parents who were slaves or, and how bad things were, and, you know.  It was awful.
Speaker 1: Can you remember any stories about your [paternal] great grandparents that they told?
Speaker 2: Well, probably one was where even when a woman was pregnant, she still had to pick cotton.  And sometimes she would have her child at the end of the row, and she would be forced to go, continue picking cotton.  That was one that was sort of very vivid to me that, such cruelty.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's--anything else?
Speaker 2: No, not at this moment.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 23715
Speaker 1: Now, that's a pretty tough story there, but, so they were able to, you know, I guess through the Freedman's Bureau, I guess, get, I mean and the changes in the South after the Emancipation, acquire this land and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So did they have any, as far as you know, any white patrons or benefactors that kind of--
Speaker 2: I do not know, but they probably had.  I mean it was just hard to do things, and even to do business down there, they would talk about and some white people would deal with them.  Other white people would not.
Speaker 1: And what did they grow primarily on their land?
Speaker 2: Oh, mostly food to sustain the family in terms of food, but also cotton and then there was, I guess hay then, they did a lot of hay.  And they sold lumber from time to time, and a lot of trees on the property down there.  And sometimes during the year, they would rent out the land to people who would hunt deer, a lot of deer down there.  So they would rent land so they could come and hunt on the land.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there's a lot of lumber.  Is that mostly pine then?
Speaker 2: Pine, all kinds.  It's just so green down there, you know, that it's just incredible.
Speaker 1: That's true.  I know they call the woods down there the Piney Woods, and there's a Piney Woods [Country Life] School there, which reminds me of, now, is there a, do you know anything--I have a note in here about the Saints Industrial and Literacy School [school for students grades one through twelve in Lexington, Mississippi].  Is that near, do you know anything about that?
Speaker 2: No, I do not.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now that was--it has something to do with Lexington, Mississippi.  And also, there's a note here in the outline about the relationship to the Choctaw Indians.  Do you have any stories about the Choctaws in your family?
Speaker 2: No, I do not.  But our--no, I do not, but I think Tchula is sort of an Indian name also.  I'm not sure of the history of that.
Speaker 1: How do you spell Tchula?
Speaker 2: Capital T-C-H-U-L-A.
Speaker 1: That's what I thought, yeah.  Tchula, Mississippi.  All right, okay, and that does have like a Choctaw kind of a, it has something to do with the Choctaws.
Speaker 2: Well, that's what we're told, that it had something to do with the Indians.
Speaker 1: Right, it's not a European name at all.  So, and you never heard of the Saints Industrial and Literacy School?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: All right.  And have you ever heard of a group called the Jubilee Harmonizers?
Speaker 2: I probably, if it's a gospel, group of gospel singers, because in those days when I was younger, there were all these different quartets, the Soul Stirrers and the Harmonizers and Blind Boys of Alabama.  So there were a lot of--and my dad [Millard Fillmore Freeman] was also a Baptist minister, one of the fire and brimstone Baptist ministers.  So we were, the family was much into religion.
Speaker 1: Okay, and there's something called the Holmes Community Hospital.  That's in Lexington too.  Have you ever heard of that?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: I suppose it has to do with Holmes County, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23716
Speaker 1: What did your father [Millard Fillmore Freeman] say about growing up [in Mississippi]?  What was growing up like for him and--
Speaker 2: Well, I guess considering the conditions in the early 1900s, strict segregation, he just was obedient, went to school, worked in the fields as his peers did and just sort of survived.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did he, was he able to finish school there?
Speaker 2: He finished high school.
Speaker 1: And do you know what high school he went to?
Speaker 2: No, I do not.
Speaker 1: Could it be this Saints Industrial and Literacy School--no, I don't know.  But it could, you know, who knows?  But, so you don't know the names of any of the schools there?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: But he finished high school in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And did he go to school in Lexington or Tchula [towns in Holmes County, Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: I do not know.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, what was your, did your dad ever talk about what he was interested in as a youth, you know, in terms of doing or going or what, you know--
Speaker 2: No, we did not talk very much.
Speaker 1: So, he became a minister, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Baptist minister?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Were there any other members of his family in the ministry?
Speaker 2: No, not to my knowledge.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your grandfather wasn't part, you know--
Speaker 2: No, he was just a deacon in the Mount Olive Baptist Church which is there in Tchula.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did your father discuss how he got in the ministry, I mean how he was called and--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --or who?
Speaker 2: Yes, and no (laughter).  So, there are so many stories about that because, not that my dad was one of these guys.  But they would talk about the ministers in that region, and usually these were bad fellows who partied too hard and did all kinds of bad things.  And they're out working in the fields and the Lord called them to the ministry.  It's not like going and getting a formal education, you see.  And so that's just how many reverends became reverends and even till today in Mississippi.  But I think my dad went to, or took a course from Moody Bible School or this is a school that still exists for training ministers.  But, in general, the stories in the neighborhood down there went, somebody got a calling or the spirit hit them or they saw a vision.  And then the next day, they're ministers.
Speaker 1: Right, now, this is--I've heard these kind of stories before, and there's a pattern.  Yeah, you're right, that a bad guy, you know, after he's done so much, he, it's a good time for the Lord to call him.  And--
Speaker 2: That's what they say.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and--
Speaker 2: But as a child, I always thought that was very interesting because the worst dude in the neighborhood, right, then all of a sudden, he has his little church with his little flock.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so, and it happens so often, it almost seems like an expectation that somebody gets so far gone, that they're called to, you know, I guess--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, okay, did your, was your father's story like that at all?  I mean was he--
Speaker 2: Well, I do not know, but I think I remember he said something about the Lord spoke to him.  I don't know whether he was sleeping or sitting somewhere, and he got the calling, and he became a minister.
Speaker 1: I guess I'm asking too if he had a story about, you know, he had, having sinned or whatever or done something wrong and--
Speaker 2: If he did, he would not have told us because he always wanted to give us the impression he was a saint (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, he went to Moody Bible in Chicago [Illinois] or in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: I think it's, I don't know, in Virginia, somewhere on the East coast.  I think it must have been a correspondence kind of thing.  But I think the, it's the Moody Bible Institute because after my dad died, for a number of years, we used to get mail from there because, you know, they're looking for their alumni and all of that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Moody is, I know it's big in Chicago.  And there are, there's a Moody Bible Institute on the South Side and there's one on the, I think on the West, and there's something downtown.  I know there's a gym even.  They have a gym and a school, a couple of branches in Chicago and the church, I think, you know.
Speaker 2: So, I'm not sure, but I think the mail used to come from Virginia somewhere, but I can check that when I get home.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause I think they're all over the United States, but I--
Speaker 2: Probably.
Speaker 1: --I know they do have like a concentration in Chicago 'cause the Moody Bible Institute was off of Cottage Grove near 87th Street.
Speaker 2: Okay, I think that is correct.  There was, at least, but, see, remember we're talking pre-1953 here.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: But there are certainly Moody Bible Institutes in Chicago or branches of it, correct.
Speaker 1: Right, so I just wondered if he--so you don't know if he--did he become a reverend before he left Mississippi?
Speaker 2: I do not know when the conversion happened.
Speaker 1: But as long as you, as far back as you can remember, was he a minister?
Speaker 2: I think so, and probably he was sort of like an assistant pastor or something in Mississippi before he came to Chicago.
Story_ID: 23717
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents met, that you know of?
Speaker 2: Well, relative to my mother [Ellen Meeks], I do not know how they met.  Relative to my stepmother, she lived--there's a little neighborhood called Rose Bank or something that's also contiguous to that area.  And I don't know whether they met at church or how, but that's about all I know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is your stepmother [Mary Cora Tolbert], you're talking about, but your mother, you don't, you have no idea how they met?  But they lived in the same general area?
Speaker 2: Right, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so did your mother move to Chicago [Illinois] with your father [Millard Fillmore Freeman] when he came to Chicago?  Is that how she got there?
Speaker 2: Well, when we were very young, we left Mississippi.  I must have been, I don't know, two, three years old or something like that, left Mississippi, came to Chicago.  And then we went back, and that's when my mother had tuberculosis.  And then she died, and there were five of us children.  And so my youngest brother, Abraham, went to live with my, one of my uncles, one of my mother's brothers.  And four of us were with my dad's parents, Albert and Sally Freeman.  And then I think about a year later, my dad married my stepmother and were living in Chicago.  And so my dad's parents told him to come get his children.  So my dad came back to Mississippi and it's a lot to ask a stepmother to deal with four children or even five.  So it was agreed that my youngest brother, Abraham, would stay with my mother's brother.  My oldest brother, Charles, would stay with my dad's parents, and my dad took three of us.  And so we moved to Chicago to live with my dad and my stepmother.
Story_ID: 23718
Speaker 1: Now, we were discussing off camera, some of your family dynamics, and they're historical basically.  They're not just, you know, they're not just particular to your family, but they're--dynamics that have to do with color and class and other things.  Can you tell us a little bit about--
Speaker 2: Well, I guess relative to my mother [Ellen Meeks] and my dad [Millard Fillmore Freeman], my dad is very dark skinned or was very dark skinned.  And my mother was fair, and my grand, my grandparents on my mother's side had a lot of white blood in them from previous generations.  And they really did not approve of my mother marrying my dad because they thought he was too dark skinned, and not good enough for her.  And so that was sort of a conflict that did not work well for my mother and my dad.
Speaker 1: Okay, after doing over a thousand of these interviews, I've detected a pattern in the land ownership in the South.  And if it doesn't pertain, you can tell me.  But a lot of times stories of people getting land right after the [American] Civil War has to do with their relationship to white people.  You know, their actual blood relationship to them.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Does that have anything to do with your mother's family?
Speaker 2: Well, we suspected that there were intimate relations between some of my mother's parents' relatives who were slaves and along with other slaves at that time.  And so this sort of generated a number of fair-skinned negroes or colored people as they were called at that time.  And so this sort of led to some type of class division based on the color of one's skin.  And so even as I was growing up in Chicago [Illinois], this was a factor in many neighborhoods among black people.  And there were fair-skinned black people or fair-skinned negroes and dark-skinned.  And some families just did not take with their fair-skinned daughter interacting with this dark-skinned fellow.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a dynamic that happens all over the United States, still going on in a lot of places now.
Speaker 2: That's true.  That's for sure.
Speaker 1: But I just wanted to make sure we talked about that.  And the skin color, I guess, and maybe it's true in your family, as I was saying earlier, is attached to property ownership on some level too.  If the white man owns the property, and he's--the slaves closest to him are getting lighter and lighter, you know, and then they end up with property.  And it's almost like you're, if you marry somebody darker, you're going back to another position, you know, or social position.
Speaker 2: No, that is true, and I think there are many stories in history about children of slave owners and slaves who were fair skinned who worked in the house or house negroes as they were called, as opposed to the darker skinned field-hand negroes.  And many of the blacks or negroes who were descendant from the slaver master, felt that they were better than the so-called darker-skinned field hands.  And so when some of the white slave owners died or moved away, they left the property to the so-called, generally left the property to the so-called house negro.
Story_ID: 23719
Speaker 1: Now you have, you said you have like five siblings or there are five of you all together?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, four siblings.
Speaker 1: Can you name your brothers and sisters and let us know where you fit in the lineup?
Speaker 2: Okay, Charles is the oldest, but, and then I'm number two, and there's Alphonzo.  That's capital A-L-P-H-O-N-Z-O.  Alphonzo is child number three.  And then we have a sister.  Her name is Elvira.  That's capital E-L-V-I-R-A.  And my youngest brother is Abraham.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and, okay, so, but you grew up with just Alphonzo--
Speaker 2: Alphonzo and Elvira, right.
Speaker 1: --and Elvira.  Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 23720
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Well, well, yes.  Well, I mean I do not know.  I, I remember a number of things when I was, three, four, five years old.
Speaker 1: Well, what's one of the early, earliest ones?
Speaker 2: Oh, I do not know, probably catching butterflies or a winter in Mississippi when they have these ice storms where the branches on the trees are coated with ice, and the ground is coated with ice, branches are breaking or on my mother's [Ellen Meeks] parents' farm, my grandmother going out and catching a chicken, and preparing it for dinner or just a kid, I guess.  I mean it's, I remember those things.
Speaker 1: Okay, so a lot of rural memories of Mississippi--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Oh, well, we're, we're out in rural Mississippi on the farm.  And probably the other thing I remember is, I did not know when my mother had died because nobody told us.  And since my mother was staying in a different structure, we were sleeping on the floor in my grandparents' house.  And so some days, she didn't, my mother did not come to the window because she was weak.  So if we did not see her for some days, it was not, you know, surprising.  But then I remember going to this funeral at the church, and I still did not know that my mother had died.  It was only after the funeral that I found out she had died.  That, I will always remember.
Speaker 1: It seems to be a general pattern in those days, not to tell children anything (laughter),--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: I don't know why.  Is that true in your household, basically, that you don't get a lot of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, children should be seen and not heard, and they're just supposed to be obedient and they're not involved in adult discussions.
Speaker 1: So even when your mother died, they never really told you?
Speaker 2: No, it was only days after the funeral, and I was wondering why my grandmother was crying and all upset and all of that.  I just assumed somebody had died.  It never occurred to me that it was my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you could actually go to the window of your grandmother's and look across and she would come to the window--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --where she was staying?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The structure, the house where she was staying was very close.  It was one of these houses that, you know, she could stay in, and we would not come in contact with her which was the idea.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23721
Speaker 1: Do you remember moving to Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes, not the first time, but the second time, because we lived on 31st Street, and I was fascinated by all of the lights and the streetcar.  I was about five years old then, I think.  And as a child I never slept very much.  So I used to just stand up at night and look out the window and just watch the streetcars go by since I did not, had not remembered seeing a streetcar before, and all the lights.  It was just, you know, I was, I guess beginning to see the difference between being on the farm and being in the city.
Speaker 1: So you all were on 31st Street--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --on the South Side in the beginning?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, this is near where IIT [Illinois Institute of Technology] is now?
Speaker 2: I do not have the slightest idea because soon after that, we moved to the West side, over to the Robert Brooks government projects.  And this was about 1942, 1943, probably in 1943.  So.
Speaker 1: Okay, so these are the Robert Brooks projects.
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hum.
Speaker 1: Now, they're on the West side, near what's now called the Maxwell Street area, right?
Speaker 2: Maxwell Street ghetto, as it is called.  And--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And specifically the closest cross streets were 13th Street and Loomis.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, we always ask--did you grow up there in Robert Brooks?
Speaker 2: Yes, until I went to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23722
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, the projects were infested with roaches, rats and garbage.  Our, the, usually, there was the building, like a long, two-story building with about eleven or thirteen apartments.  At the end of each building, they had an incinerator where people were supposed to put their garbage in, and it was supposed to be burned.  But after a while, it was just all over the place.  So there was always garbage.  You turn off the light at night, and (laughter), turn the lights back on, there are roaches everywhere.  And it turned out that the construction in the projects were such that if you, you know, fought the roaches, they just went next door (laughter) and came back the next day.  And another thing I remember, we used to run around a lot.  I mean we had, there were vacant lots, so we used to play ball in these vacant lots.  And we used to run around a lot, but this was before they had a cure for polio.  And so there were a fair number of our young children who had polio.  And I was young myself at that time, but I always thought it was so sad because although we were poor, but we could just sort of run around or play ball and do things.  And, but that was the first few years in the project.  And then later on, they did build a playground a few blocks away, Fosco playground.  So there were some organized activities.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, polio was really a big issue in the '50s [1950s], the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, because, you know, all, you know, there was nothing you could do.  I mean all of a sudden a child just, we just thought it was awful because we ran around a lot.  We played ball a lot and all of a sudden somebody cannot.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, continue.  What were some of the other sights and sounds and smells?
Speaker 2: Well, I, well, it turned out there was a public school about three or four blocks away.  This was called Medill, capital M-E-D-I-L-L, I think.  And one thing about Medill is that the police escorted the teachers in, in the morning, and the police escorted the teachers out in the afternoon.  They did not have a PTA [Parent Teacher Association] because they tried to, and the parents would beat up the teachers (laughter).  That was just awful, you know.  And so, but across the street from where we lived was a Catholic elementary school.  And fortunately for us, our, our parents [Millard Fillmore Freeman and stepmother, Mary Cora Tolbert] could afford a quarter a month.  So we went to St. Joseph Elementary School, across the street from our house because we would have never survived at Medill.  They would have, those kids would have killed us.
Speaker 1: Now, this is 19--this is in the 1940s--
Speaker 2: '40s [1940s], yeah, 1940s, yes, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so this, you start school what, in 19--
Speaker 2: I think--'43 [1943], I think.
Speaker 1: --'43 [1943]?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23723
Speaker 1: We were talking earlier about how bad the schools are today.  And you described a situation that seemed just as bad, in 1943.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, it was worse, it was worse than today because--it was worse then than today.  I mean the schools are bad because our present-day society wants it to be that way because it's easier to manipulate an uneducated population.  But in those days, it was just bad because they put black people in these projects in certain areas and nobody was concerned from the outside community or from the government, city or state or national about what went on there.
Speaker 1: So these projects, and once again, maybe to describe them, you described the rats and the roaches and the garbage.  And these are two-story projects?
Speaker 2: Two-story, right.
Speaker 1: They're kind of like the old Ida B. Wells [Ida B. Wells Homes was a Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) public housing project located in the Bronzeville neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago,; named after an early civil rights advocate, who was a journalist, suffragist, newspaper editor and sociologist]in Chicago--
Speaker 2: Well, I think, Ida--
Speaker 1: --in terms of how they look?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I think, I thought Ida B. Wells had more stories or something like that.  But Robert Brooks [government projects in Chicago where Freeman lived], I thought was sort of like barns, you know, like where you have milking cows.  You have this long flat, and you have a little--that's minimum construction, but it was better than what--the structures outside of the projects.  So it was, you know, it was an improvement.
Speaker 1: Now, what were those structures like because we've heard, I mean from what I understand, that area was called the black belt in those days.  I mean they, (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --from, I guess, the turn of the century on, area--well, not where Robert Brooks is, but the area that you all moved into first, along 31st Street--
Speaker 2: Yes, I was gonna say--
Speaker 1: --and that's the black belt.
Speaker 2: Black belt because, but, you know, I never knew that until I got to Central State [University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  And in my first year of sociology, I'm reading about the black belt of Chicago, about crime and drugs.  I said, hey, this is my old neighborhood.  But we never called it the black belt, I mean, but it was another revelation to me, you know, when I got away to college.  And then I read more, and I says, I'm not even supposed to be in college.  I'm supposed to be dead because the odds are so against me.  But I think, as you indicated, where we first lived in Chicago before moving to the projects was probably part of the black belt around 31st Street.
Speaker 1: And I know people we've interviewed who, especially, the older people or people that have been in the--I mean we have folks that are 106 years old and that sort of thing who remember it way back when the riots took place there in 1919 and all that.  And I know the structures, you know, that were along that black belt, they were mowed down to build the projects, pretty much later.  And, well, when you described the projects being better than what, the other housing, what was that other housing like on the West side?
Speaker 2: Well, it was, well, the dividing line was Loomis [street], and on the other side from the projects, these were just old dilapidated buildings, you know.  And, again, they were, I guess, two, three-story buildings.  And in the next block, there was a barn, a place where they kept horses because they had peddlers in those days.  This was before the days of the refrigerator, the ice man went around with his ice on his horse-drawn wagon.  But that's where they kept the horses, the watermelon man who sold watermelons, had a horse pulling it around.  So there was a big barn in the next block.  But several blocks after that, it was just old houses, sort of dilapidated.
Speaker 1: Were they like tall houses or wooden houses or--
Speaker 2: Well, they were brick and, mostly, if I remember.  And they were generally two or three stories high, yes.  And then there was a lot of wood because they would have like a porch in the back and a set of fire escapes.  You know, you had stairs going down the outside of the house.  And these were wooden parts of the structures.
Speaker 1: A lot of 'em were dilapidated, you're saying.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that housing, I mean typically in a place, a three-story structure like that in those days, we'd be talking about three separate families living on each floor or--
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: --a lot of people living--
Speaker 2: Three separate, multiple families because in those days, black people were migrating from the South, and in many cases, you'd come up and live with a relative.  And then paying rent was another problem because I know they used to have these rent parties and things.  So people would just sort of pay rent.  So sometimes in one apartment or one unit, there could be two or three families or fragments of two or three families.
Speaker 1: Okay, that was another perspective because we, I know Chicago's been written about.  Like you said, when you went to Central State, you read about it.  Lorraine Hansberry [playwright and writer] in her play talks about the crowded conditions in the black community, you know, which was bursting at the seams with immigrants, but no place to go, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So that's, anyway, so, the projects as bad as it was, lots of roaches, rats, garbage and other things, but it's better than living in other places.
Speaker 2: Oh, definitely, yeah.
Speaker 1: How many rooms did you have in your apartment?
Speaker 2: Downstairs was a living room and a kitchen and a little utility room.  And upstairs, there were three bedrooms and a bathroom.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23724
Speaker 1: So, you all were fortunate enough to go to the Catholic school which was better than--
Speaker 2: The public school.
Speaker 1: --Medill [school].
Speaker 2: Yeah, Medill.
Speaker 1: And Medill being named after the great journalist, Joseph Medill, you know, Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern [University, Chicago/Evanston, Illinois] is named after him.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: Here's, (laughter), and here it is a school that you have to have a police escort to go teach at, you know.  So, okay, all right, well, tell us about St. Joseph's Catholic School.
Speaker 2: Well, it was pretty good.  The nuns, I thought were good teachers.  It was interesting because I think I started maybe in the fall of 1943, and I think in the fall of the next year, I was in the fourth grade because I skipped third, and after a few months, they put me in second grade.  But I thought learning was the best thing in the world.  So I just temporarily had total recall.  I mean I would just read everything.  And so my second year of school, I'm in fourth grade, and, you know, it was easy for me.  And I remember I used to daydream a lot when I was a kid.  And then by the time the teacher, the nun would call my name the third time, I'd come back from outer space, answer her question, go daydreaming again.  And then they wanted to put me in fifth grade, but then my parents [Millard Fillmore Freeman and stepmother, Mary Cora Tolbert] felt I was moving too fast.  And so for much of the next couple of years, I just sat in the hallway taking the names of the children that went to the bathroom because whatever the class assignments, I just read it, and I just sort of knew it, and I read everything else I could read.  And I remember reading the books in the library and I didn't know what I was reading, but I was reading them anyway (laughter).  So, school is actually what probably saved my life, but I always enjoyed learning, and it was always easy.  And, which leads to certain family dynamics because my brother [Alphonzo Freeman] came behind me, and they were always comparing him to me, which meant he was not happy with me.  But I did not know.  I just, they told me I had to learn it.  I would learn it.  And, of course, this leads to cases in the classroom where the class bully would sit next to you and want you to pass the answers during the test or what have you.  And then sometimes after school, people wanna beat you up for getting a good grade.  But luckily, I was a pretty good athlete, and that also saved me in other cases because I was pretty good to play--be on the team.  But I guess they decided they shouldn't beat me up so much.  But it was a, I did not know what was going on at that time.  But it was a most interesting childhood.  I had no idea what was going on.  I was just being a kid.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so you enjoyed learning, and did you, now, did you go to a library outside of the school?
Speaker 2: No, (laughter).
Speaker 1: No, okay.
Speaker 2: You know--
Speaker 1: Were there any books in the home, where you grew up?  Did you have any books at home?
Speaker 2: Just the Bible.  The, what happened, I think eventually, by the time I got to high school, there was a library not too far away.  But I think at that age, I did not even know what a library was.  I knew that at St. Joseph's there were these bookcases with books in them, and I just started reading them, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have a favorite subject matter when you look back on it at St. Joseph's?
Speaker 2: No, I just liked everything.  I mean it's just learning.  I just thought it was great.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite teacher?
Speaker 2: Well, no, because I thought all of them were pretty good.  I mean these nuns, and they go around rapping students on their knuckles and they always appeared to be genuinely interested in us learning, you know.  So I thought it was great that they were so smart.
Speaker 1: So were most of the students black or all of them?
Speaker 2: Almost all of them.  I think in the school, there were probably two or three white children and probably two or three Mexicans, but it was a relatively small school.  I think my graduation class must have been less than twenty students.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you had to--to go there, you had to be fairly well off, considering the neighborhood, I guess?  Or better off than a lot of people to go to Catholic school or your parents would have at least educational priorities, I guess?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, and but both my dad and stepmother worked, and sometimes my dad worked two jobs in addition to having his church.  But the tuition was only about a quarter a month, and it was a Catholic school, so we got a lot of Catholicism through Catechism at that time.  But I--fortunately, my parents had an appreciation for education.  And so--
Speaker 1: So considering inflation, a quarter a month would be the equivalent of maybe ten dollars now or--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --or maybe five dollars.
Speaker 2: I do not know.
Speaker 1: It's cheap though, still cheap even--and you could buy in 1943, what could you buy with a quarter, I mean in terms of food?
Speaker 2: I, I never went shopping (laughter) when I was five or six years old (laughter).  But you could get a lot of things for a penny or two pennies, you know, so.
Speaker 1: I've heard it said that you could get a, say a quart of milk for a nickel or something.
Speaker 2: Probably, yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: So I'm thinking maybe six, seven dollars a month would be the equivalent of--
Speaker 2: Could be.
Speaker 1: --somewhere in that.  It gives, you know, at least it's something to consider.  It's not like a quarter today.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, so all right, well, were any of your teachers African American?
Speaker 2: No, all white nuns in their black habits.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I have no complaints against them because I learned a lot my few years there.
Speaker 1: And you said earlier that had you gone to Medill, you probably wouldn't have made it.
Speaker 2: Ah, (laughter), children, other children who lived near us went to Medill.  Some days they would have to, although Medill was only a few blocks away, it would take 'em a mile to get home because they had to escape all these bullies and things and take circular routes to get home.  It was, it was just a jungle, is what it was.  And we were fortunate in that respect.
Story_ID: 23725
Speaker 1: So was there a particular gang that dominated the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Yes, the gangs in those days were dominated by the number of brothers you had, see, and I guess one was the Boone.  There were about thirteen of them.  Get in a fight with one of them, you had to fight the whole family, you know.  And so, usually the more boys in a family, they just sort of formed a gang and then other fellows not part of their family said, well, this is sort of a superior force.  So this is how it was dominated.  But usually, they just beat people up.  They were not into cutting people or shooting people or maybe they'd hit you with a brick or a rock or a stick.  But they didn't generally kill you.
Speaker 1: Okay, in those days it was no, I mean the narcotics traffic and all those other things that gangs do now, was not part of it.
Speaker 2: Well, not with the gangs.  There were drugs and winos and drunkards, but that was older people.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it wasn't organized at the teenage level to--
Speaker 2: No, I don't know of any--
Speaker 1: --do that sort of thing. Okay.
Story_ID: 23726
Speaker 1: So we were just talking about the West Side, South Side dynamic [Chicago, Illinois] off camera here, where you said your wife went to Hyde Park High School--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --which is in, which actually used to be in Hyde Park in Chicago.
Speaker 2: But isn't the University of Chicago still in Hyde Park?
Speaker 1: It is, yes.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: It will always be (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 1: But the surrounding community, you know, a lot of people consider that Woodlawn, even though it's technically Hyde Park, you know--
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: And I think Hyde Park technically goes to 75th Street.
Speaker 2: Well, certainly, because that's where my ex-wife, who became my ex-wife was living, and a couple of my children were living around 55th Street.
Speaker 1: But hardly anybody considers any of that, you know, anything past, I guess South of 60th Street, Hyde Park anymore.  It's just, it's almost like it's all, the rest of it is Woodlawn.  I mean that's how people think of it.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: But technically--
Speaker 2: Remember, I grew up in Chicago, and in 1953, I started going away to college.  So, and after I graduated from Central State [University, Wilberforce, Ohio], then I went to graduate school.  So I'm living in Michigan, and then I--of course, I'd come back to Chicago periodically.  And then I moved to California in 1962.  So although I grew up in Chicago, I'm really sort of a stranger to Chicago since 1953.
Speaker 1: And you've done a lot of travel too, which we'll talk about when we get to that, but that's in Paris [France] and Germany and everywhere else.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 23727
Speaker 1: Now, did you go to a middle school or anything?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, I went--
Speaker 1: Straight through eighth grade at St. Joseph's [Catholic School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that right.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have any inkling when you were a youngster about science, I mean any sense that you were gonna grow up and become a chemist?
Speaker 2: No idea at all.
Speaker 1: So nobody gave you a Gilbert chemistry set or, at any juncture?
Speaker 2: No, and no one ever talked about what to do in the future, you see, because after I graduated from St. Joseph, Cregier [High School] was the neighborhood high school which was an awful place to go.  Everybody agreed.  So I went to Crane Tech High School [Richard T. Crane Technical Preparatory High School].  And so I don't know whether I'm gonna become a welder or automobile mechanic, but this is what a technical high school does.
Speaker 1: Now, was there, did someone advise you to go to Crane?
Speaker 2: No, but we knew that it was not a good idea to go to Cregier [Cregier High School], the neighborhood high school because it was not as bad as Medill [school], but people were always dropping out.  And nobody graduated and the feeling in the community was that nobody was learning anything at Cregier.
Speaker 1: Why, it's puzzling to me, and I guess I have to put myself in the position of those teachers in those days.  If I had a student that was so bright, I'd be willing to skip him two grades, you know, I mean as he starts school.  And I assume you followed suit.  You said you always made good grades and you were diligent in terms of doing your work and that sort of thing.  But it seems like if I was a nun teaching you, I would try to, I would know I had something special, and I'd be trying to push you towards some program that would--
Speaker 2: Well, nobody, I just happened to end up at Crane Tech because it was still, you did not need a special permit because it was still in the district so to speak.  But when you graduated from elementary school, everybody just went to Cregier from my neighborhood.
Speaker 1: So was there any attempt to put you in Catholic high school?
Speaker 2: Well, no.  There was a short discussion, but I think I do not know whether it was because of expense or whatever, but there was no going to a Catholic high school.  And I--
Speaker 1: Did any of your classmates go to Catholic high school?
Speaker 2: I, not to my knowledge.  I do not know whether anybody seriously investigated that or not.  But it was never seriously considered.
Speaker 1: Okay, I just wondered.  Now, this, you're in the eighth grade in 1950--
Speaker 2: '49 [1949], I graduated in 1949.
Speaker 1: '49 [1949], '49 [1949] from eighth grade?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, '49 [1949], all right, okay.  So--
Speaker 2: So it could have been as simple as just the tuition issue, and I'm not sure that there was a Catholic high school close by, but--
Speaker 1: Okay,--
Speaker 2: So there was no counseling.  There was no guidance, so I just happened to end up at Crane Tech, in part because everybody thought Cregier was just so bad.
Speaker 1: Now, was it your father [Millard Fillmore Freeman] primarily, or your stepmother [Mary Cora Tolbert] that thought or someone else that was advising you about education 'cause, I know somebody took the initiative to put you in St. Joseph, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think my parents, my stepmother and my dad did that, but after that, nobody ever told me anything or even suggested anything.
Speaker 1: Now, did they come to your graduation?
Speaker 2: Not from elementary school and I think my stepmother came to my graduation from high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm just thinking about the eighth grade now, about this transition.  And so what were your grades like when you graduated from St. Joseph's?  Were you still maintaining--
Speaker 2: Straight As.
Speaker 1: Straight As?
Speaker 2: Well, we had numbers, and 98 and 99, 100.
Speaker 1: Okay, and nobody came to your graduation (laughter)?
Speaker 2: No, (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, I'm just--but they were interested enough to pay that tuition at St. Joseph's, so--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes, yes.
Story_ID: 23728
Speaker 1: When you were growing up, I know that church was probably a big, big affair.  And did you--what are your memories of church and religion, your father [Millard Fillmore Freeman] being a pastor and all?
Speaker 2: Well, that was interesting.  I think that was one of the reasons, the church was one of the reasons we did not talk very much, especially on Sunday mornings before we went to church because at a very early age, it, you know, we were poor.  All around us, people were poorer than we were.  And there's always the suffering and being the son, the children of the minister, we had to go to church.  So we went to church on Sundays.  We went to mission or something on Tuesday and something else on Wednesdays.  And I'm still a kid, so I'm asking my dad, how come the people in church are always the poor people, the poor people are always suffering.  And there are people with one of the big, well, there was like policy, these little games, people used to pay pennies.  And other people who were sort of like small-time crooks were doing well.  They never went to church.  But it was always the poor people there and always the people who were suffering, you know.  And so after a few Sunday mornings of that discussion, we stopped talking on Sunday mornings.   And then in the Baptist church, once a year, they have the so-called Revival, where sinners can join the church and get baptized and the back sliders who were formerly church members would get reoriented, so to speak.  Well, we sat on the mourners' bench.  And usually for the Revival, they used to bring some minister from out of town or from Mississippi or Georgia.  And my brother [Alphonzo Freeman] and my sister [Elvira Freeman] joined the church.  I did not.  And I remember this one reverend D. A. Williams.  He came and preached the Revival.  Many years later he came back (laughter) and he looked down at me sitting on the mourner's bench.  He says, he called me little Fillmore, and he says, you still there (laughter).  So in any event, that's sort of indicative of religion in terms of being discussed between my dad and I.  We just didn't talk about it.  I do not think he ever forgave me for not joining his church.  And, but we always went and we used to have children's day, and they used to have ice cream and cake.  So if they were about to run out, the ministers' children have to go to the end of the line.  So this only happened a couple times a year, but sometimes we missed out on it.  And what I also should mention about St. Joseph's [Catholic School], I mean we had, we went to mass and all of that and Catechism, but the idea of Catholic, becoming Catholic was not an issue.  But another thing about St. Joseph is that usually on Christmas and Thanksgiving, they would give us a basket of food.  And that was a chicken in there, a turkey in there, and that was, I always thought was very good of St. Joseph's.  But getting back to my dad's church, I essentially enjoyed going to church.  I liked the choir singing and most of the sermons, I sort of liked, you know.  But when I, at my young age, looked at reality and religion, it was just conflict.  And so it was quiet on Sunday mornings in Reverend Freeman's house.  We did not talk.
Speaker 1: Now, did you come to a certain point in your youth where you just thought that religious was false or did you--
Speaker 2: Well, no, I just, see, it's difficult to reconcile an all-powerful, all-good God with what was going on in my everyday life.  It's just, you know, I remember one day I said to my dad, you know, if I could make a world and I could make people, I'd make them all healthy and happy.  And if I did not do that, you would call me mean and cruel.  And after he slapped me upside of my head (laughter), I never said that anymore.  But it just never made sense to me.  It's just too much suffering.  I mean I'm a kid.  I mean I don't know.  It just never made sense to me, and a lot of the poor people and the people who were suffering were really good people.  I mean they were just, so, it just did not make sense.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23729
Speaker 1: Now, what did your father [Millard Fillmore Freeman] do for a living besides--
Speaker 2: He was a laborer.  He worked, for a lot time at Maremont.  They used to make mufflers for cars, and then he worked at some other factory outside of Chicago [Illinois] because sometimes he only worked one job.  But sometimes he was working two jobs.  And my stepmother [Mary Cora Tolbert] worked at EKCO Products.  They made kitchen utensils and things up on the North Side.  And at that time, they would have a Christmas party, so we'd get on the streetcar and go up to the North Side.  It was very nice.  And she was always sort of unhappy about the fact that all these poorly educated white people would come to work at EKCO Products, and she would train 'em and all of a sudden, they're her supervisor.  This went on year after year.  But fortunately, she had a job, and then they had what they called "piece work," and she was good or she could work fast and be very productive.  So that was good.  And then when my dad could, he worked two jobs, and then that enabled them to finally make enough money to exceed the amount--by this time, I'm in college though, to make to live in the projects, 'cause if you make a certain amount, they kick you out.  So they moved out.

Speaker 1: Now, did you work when you were growing up at all?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, I, these wagons I was telling you about.  I used to work on the watermelon wagon, you know, when they would go--mostly, on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois], this one guy.  His name was Leonard.  I worked with Leonard, and he paid better than the other watermelons sellers.  And so what happened is that, you know, they'd walk around.  He's yelling "watermelon wagon," "watermelon man," and then somebody up on the second or third floor wants a watermelon.  So he'd cut a little triangular plug in it, (laughter) hold it up and watermelon man.  And then I'd carry it up.  So here I am on this wagon with my little straw hat, like I just came off the farm.  But that was my first job, was working on the watermelon wagon.
Speaker 1: That's interesting, you said a stable was near your home.  And that's something that, you know, past the '50s [1950s], I guess you just don't see that anymore.
Speaker 2: You don't-this is true. (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: You know, you just don't see that anymore.
Speaker 2: This is true.
Speaker 1: The ice man and the watermelon man, on a wagon.
Speaker 2: No, this is true.  And that's where they took their animals in the evening and collected them in the morning.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's part of American life that's gone now in the cities.  So you had a straw hat to make it look like you were part of the farm's (laughter)--
Speaker 2: No, no, it was hot.  You know, how hot and humid it was in Chicago.  It was strictly to protect me from the sun.  And then another job I had was doing the same kind of thing.  There was a dairy a few block away, and so I would help the milkman deliver milk.  So I think those were my first two jobs.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how old were you when you started working for the watermelon man and the ice man--I mean the dairy?
Speaker 2: I do not know.  I was pretty young when I started working on the watermelon wagon.  I don't know, probably, maybe seventh, eighth grade, I'm not sure.  And--
Speaker 1: Okay, so twelve or thirteen [years old]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Or eleven or twelve [years old] 'cause you were a year ahead, right?
Speaker 2: Right, and working on the, with the milkman was later, subsequent to the-
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: Now, Crane Tech High School [Richard T. Crane Technical Preparatory High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so you're there, and, now did you, did they have a college prep course at all, at Crane Tech?
Speaker 2: I assume they did, but nobody told me about it because when I went to Crane Tech, I thought, well, maybe I should be an architect.  So then I took mechanical drawing, and then I, you have to ink these things.  And that's tedious work.  It's easy to smear things.  I decided I was not going to be an architect.  And, then I said, well, maybe I should be an automobile mechanic.  So I took automobile shop, and it was interesting because we used to take these motors or engines apart, put 'em back together, start 'em up, but we have a bucket full of nuts and bolts (laughter) left over.  And then I took welding--
Speaker 1: Are you saying that those nuts and bolts didn't get back in the engine?
Speaker 2: No, but it would start up.  We got a passing grade (laughter).  And then I was taking welding which I (unclear) and soldering torches and stuff.  But that was about the end of my second year.  And about that time I accidently discovered something called college prep, just talking about, talking to other students.  And that's when it occurred to me I should leave Crane Tech.  And so that's how I ended up, after two years at Crane Tech, I started my third year of high school at Marshall [High School; John Marshall Metropolitan High School].
Speaker 1: Okay, so was it difficult to get into Marshall?
Speaker 2: Well, no, but you needed a permit to get into Marshall, and my parents [Millard Fillmore Freeman and Mary Cora Tolbert] said they would not sign the permit for me to go to Marshall.
Speaker 1: Well, why not?  What was their rationale for--
Speaker 2: I do not know, I do not know.  They just--because they, well, to them, going to Crane Tech was a big deal.  So, I was, I always got good grades, and so they thought I was doing well.
Speaker 1: Well, now, describe Marshall in those days.  Now, Marshall today is a, well, it's still a huge high school.
Speaker 2: A very large high school.
Speaker 1: How many students would you say?
Speaker 2: Oh, I do not know, but there were several hundred in my graduation class.
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: Three or 400.  It was a very large school--
Speaker 1: I'm thinking four or 5,000 students--
Speaker 2: Probably.
Speaker 1: --at Marshall.
Speaker 2: And I think it must have been at least 90 percent Jewish or something like that because on the Jewish holidays, nothing took place because all the--I mean we were there, but the classrooms were essentially empty.  But they had a good reputation.  It was one of the top schools in high school--one of the top high schools in Chicago.  And so after I managed to get a signed permit to go to Marshall, I went to Marshall.  Now, in the fall, there's always the National Baptist Convention somewhere in America where all the Baptist ministers go.  So my dad went to this convention and he came back, and my stepmother told him I was going to Marshall.  He came into my room and--at least our room, my brother [Alphonzo Freeman] was there and told me I had to go back to Crane Tech.  So for a week or so this argument is going on because I did not want to go back to Crane Tech, but finally he relented.  And so I stayed at Marshall.  And I was on the basketball team, and did well there, in the National Honor Society and was doing well there.  So, that was a good move.  But it just all, not planned, it was all by fate, happenstance, just, it just happened.  It was never discussed, never planned.  In fact, I don't think I'd heard of Marshall High School (laughter) until I was ready to transfer there.  But I just sort of felt that Crane Tech was not the place for me.
Story_ID: 23732
Speaker 1: Now, what was the--give us a sense of what the size of your world was, you know.  I mean what was the size of your world when you were say, a sophomore in high school.  I mean where had you been?  I mean did you go downtown at all?  Did you go around the city of Chicago [Illinois]?  Did you go back to Mississippi periodically or how--
Speaker 2: We went back to Mississippi once.  And mostly it was from home to, once in a while, we'd go shopping with my stepmother [Mary Cora Tolbert] and downtown.  And at 12th--on 12th Street near the Maxwell Street ghetto, there was a 12th Street Store.  So we used to go there 'cause they used to shop there a lot.  But basically, we just stayed in the ghetto.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, the Maxwell Street area, they formerly called it Jew Town--
Speaker 2: Jew Town, right.
Speaker 1: Now, it's--
Speaker 2: That was 12th Street and, but it was a place to go to shop because you could always discount things there and clothing and so it was a good place for poor people to go shopping on the weekends.
Speaker 1: Was the shop Cheat You Fair there when you were growing up (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well, I do not know, but it was a lot, like on the weekends, a lot of stalls and temporary things on the streets, you know.  Of course, there were some standard stores and things there too.  But it was always crowded, and so people, they'd come back and maybe we thought we were getting a good deal because we kept going back or it could have been the only place we could get 'em.
Speaker 1: Now, I didn't get there till the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: Well, it changed a lot after that I hear.
Speaker 1: When you were there, did they play live Blues on the streets in, on Maxwell Street or--
Speaker 2: I don't, I do not think so.
Speaker 1: Or were the Vienna sausages, I mean the Chicago Vienna sausage hot dogs--
Speaker 2: Well, they had these, always kosher hot dogs.  I don't know whether they were Vienna or not, but they always, the hot dogs were good.
Speaker 1: It seems to be a Chicago tradition with all the onions on it.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23733
Speaker 1: So, at Crane [Tech High School; Richard T. Crane Technical Preparatory High School, Chicago, Illinois], now, you played basketball.  Were you always a good athlete?
Speaker 2: Only on the neighborhood basis.  I did not do anything at Crane Tech.  I, actually, I was on the cheerleading, I was a cheerleader (laughter) when I first, I was a little kid, my first year at Crane Tech.  But when I got to Marshall [High School; John Marshall Metropolitan High School], in those days, they had junior basketball, if you were 5'8" [five feet and eight inches tall] and under, and senior basketball if you were taller than that.  So my junior year, actually, I was less than 5'8" so I played center [position] on Marshall's junior basketball team.  Now, Marshall had a long history of being very good.  I mean, for example, they went, won ninety-nine games over a number of seasons, lost one, won forty-three in a row.  So it was a good place to be.  And so my junior year, I was a senior on the junior team--my junior year I was a center on the junior team.  And then they did away with that, height distinction.  But then my senior year, I played on the varsity.  So--
Speaker 1: What position did you play on the varsity?
Speaker 2: Guard, forward and I got lucky and started scoring in double figures, so it worked out.
Speaker 1: That sounds like more than lucky.  If you scored in double figures consistently, that's--
Speaker 2: Well, it's because--and the reason that Marshall was so good at basketball all those years is because they had dedicated coaches.  I think many high schools, they would practice for one period or two periods after school.  But we used to be there for hours every day.  And we were, I mean, you know, they were good and it was a good system.  So, and so Marshall was a good move.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23734
Speaker 1: And the other aspect is that when I was, first went to Marshall [High School; John Marshall Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois], I ended up in a class called 'Careers', and there was this teacher, Ms. Margoles.  And we used to take these standardized tests, you know, measuring I.Q. and all this kind of stuff.  And they were just beginning to get into machine scoring.  And then I used to score so high on those, they would then hand score mine, you see, because they knew something was wrong with the machine.  And so Ms. Margoles was just blown away.  She was, "Oh, Fillmore, you're a genius, you're a genius," and all that.  So I spent a term just taking all these tests, scored very well.  Again, I'm oblivious to all this 'cause it was easy, it was just the easiest thing for me to do.
Speaker 2: Now, let's chew on this for a minute.  And it sounds, I mean the way you describe it, none of this is difficult for you?  I mean, I mean--
Speaker 1: Well, no, school was never difficult for me.
Speaker 2: School was, yeah, so even for most people, that get good grades, they study or something.  But--
Speaker 1: Well, I just--
Speaker 2: --they study hard or they work hard.
Speaker 1: Oh, I studied.  I just sort of remembered everything I read.
Speaker 2: Okay, so it was just never difficult--
Speaker 1: Oh, I got to graduate school (laughter).
Speaker 2: Because when you were, yeah, 'cause when you describe, you know, Marshall in those days, you had like a large Jewish population, a lot of kids, were really smart kids--
Speaker 1: Very smart, yes, yes.  And a fair number of their students always, after their second year of high school, went to the University of Chicago because it had that program for gifted high school students.  If they excelled after two years, they could just transfer to the University of Chicago.  So, a fair number of students over the years from Marshall went there.  So I, I mean I was just perfectly happy because I was surrounded by all these smart people, you know.
Speaker 2: And they, but they come from scholarly traditions in a lot of ways, a lot of the Jewish--
Speaker 1: Right, a different background.
Speaker 2: --homes really pushed education in ways that sounds like your parents [Millard Fillmore Freeman and Mary Cora Tolbert], though, I think they wanted the best for you, they didn't have like a roadmap of how you were gonna--
Speaker 1: No, because they did not know any better.  See, this is why it's a lot, has a lot to do with luck because in those days--and it's always interesting over the years when I talk to white Americans because when white people see police, they think, ah, how wonderful.  You've come to protect us.  When I was growing up in the projects, you see the police car, you ran.  They had one police car.  The number was 22.  They had these three fat Polish policemen in there.  And if a group of us were just standing at the corner, they'd just get out and take out their clubs and just start whacking us, you know.  So that's why we ran, you know.  And periodically, they would just sort of round you up if we were standing around in a group, and they used to have what we called a paddy wagon.  It's something that looked like a SUV, except there were bars on the window.  And so sometimes they would surprise us, and they could not put all of us in the paddy wagon.  So they would take every other one.  So the person on my left was taken, the person on my right was taken, and then that means they wanna send you to juvenile or something like that.  It's just the story of my--I mean it's just chance, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I can understand why you consider yourself lucky, but you also, you know, seem to have a lot of native ability to be able to--
Speaker 1: Yes, well, I had no control.  That was always sort of involuntary, and nobody sat down and says, you know, this is what you should do if you wanna be this or be that or be that, you see.  I was just doing it, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you're very bright and lucky at the same time.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) What else can it be?  I mean because there were people from my neighborhood who were just as smart or smarter than I.  And they just, too much pressure in the ghetto, believe me, and they just couldn't handle it.
Story_ID: 23735
Speaker 1: Okay, Marshall High School [John Marshall Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois].  So, they--you were saying earlier, and I'm just going back to this, that they graded the tests electronically, but in your case, they went back over it with a--
Speaker 2: To check it, yeah.
Speaker 1: --to check it to make sure that, you know, because they could not believe that it was, you didn't fit their stereotype of what you were supposed to do on the test?
Speaker 2: Right, but Ms. Margoles became a believer after a while.  She was my best fan club.  She just--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, now how were your grades at Marshall?  Did you--
Speaker 2: Oh, good.  I was in the National Honor Society.
Speaker 1: So were you ever, was there ever a point when you moved over to Marshall where you thought, wow, they're really ahead of me, you know, coming from Crane [Tech High School; Richard T. Crane Technical Preparatory High School] or coming from St. Joseph's [Catholic School]?  You never felt like that?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They actually were, but it just didn't matter.  I mean I didn't take long to catch up.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you--how far could you go in the sciences at Marshall?
Speaker 2: I took physics and chemistry.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what about mathematics?  Did you--
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: --did they have calculus?
Speaker 2: I do not believe they offered calculus.  They could have, but I did not take calculus in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the highest math you had was--
Speaker 2: Some algebra, advanced algebra or something.
Speaker 1: Algebra II or something like that?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did they have trigonometry?  Is that the same or--
Speaker 2: Well, I do not know.  I didn't take, I took trigonometry when I was at the university, but not in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, well, when--so you're playing basketball, you're in the National Honor Society.  Were you involved in any other activities at Marshall?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes, there's one interesting one, see, because they had this contest every spring, where they would sort of elect a "Ms. Marshall," you know, or they used to call her Marshall Hall.  And so they decided they should have a Marshall King, right.  This is, all the students vote for it.  And I became Marshall King, the first, and Marshall King, the last, because when these parents found out that this black kid was Marshall King, no more Marshall King contests.  But--
Speaker 1: Now, that's remarkable.  So you became "Marshall King."  Did you have a--what do you attribute it to?  Now, you--
Speaker 2: Well, only because, well, I was a basketball player, and I mean, you know, you got thousands of students voting.  I mean, but, so I think that was the reason.
Speaker 1: Now, you were also an honor student?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, and, but--
Speaker 1: Now, did you hold any other positions?  Did you run for student office or anything?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But the interesting thing, they were supposed to have this big ceremony (laughter), you know, in the auditorium for Marshall King and Marshall Hall, but they had it in the big auditorium for her, and then they had a little side ceremony in the gym for me, Marshall King (laughter), tough life.
Speaker 1: That's, I mean in those days, did you just figure it out as par for the course that you--
Speaker 2: What could I do?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean that's the way life was.
Story_ID: 23736
Speaker 1: Now, you graduated, what, 1953, is that it?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, this is one year before 'Brown vs. Board of Education' [1954; U.S. Supreme Court ruling against segregation in schools].  It's like post-war, you know, Chicago.  Did you, now, were you drawn to--well, I should say, were you drawn to chemistry at all at this juncture?
Speaker 2: Well, yes and no.  I mean I was always fascinated by it, but I was thinking about being a doctor at that time until I discovered in those days, even if you're white or Jewish, it helped if your dad or your uncle were a doctor to get into medical school.  But I was majoring in chemistry and minoring in mathematics.  And so I just sort of stayed in chemistry because I knew medical school was going to be that way.  But, again, because Central State [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] was a land grant college, I had to take two years of ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps].  And then I decided it was in my best interest to take Advanced ROTC.  So I went to summer camp at Fort Bragg [large U.S. Army installation], North Carolina and did all right.  And then I was thinking about making a military career.  So I signed up for the paratroopers and for the rangers and the Green Berets [U.S. Army Soecial Forces].  So I was gonna be this great warrior.  But it turned out, after I graduated from Central State, I went to grad school at Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan]--
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.  We're moving too fast now.  We're galloping--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --too fast.  But let me find out first how did you choose Central State [University]?
Speaker 2: Well, it was sort of by accident in a way because they and I also sent clippings and things to Wilberforce University [Wilberforce, Ohio], but I got a response back from Central State University.  And so I went to Central State, and another member of our basketball team also went to Central State.  And the next year, another Chicagoan from, I think maybe from Farragut [High School] or I don't know, maybe from Marshall, but anyway, three of us ended up playing basketball at Central State.
Speaker 1: Now, was that part of the deal?  Did you get a scholarship to play ball?
Speaker 2: Yeah, scholarship, right.  I had a--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --scholarship the first three years, but the chemistry professor felt that I shouldn't be playing basketball.  And so when I became a senior, he told me he would not recommend me to graduate school if I didn't do research and stop--at that time, we traveled all over the country on buses.  And so the basketball trips took a long time.  We played in Louisiana.  We used to go to Lincoln [University] in Jefferson City, Missouri, Kentucky State [University].  And so I played my first three years on scholarship.  And part of the reason for that was that the athletic scholarship paid more than the academic scholarship.  But in any event, so I did not play basketball my senior year, and focused on my studies.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what you said in the beginning was kind of curious to me that you sent your material to Wilberforce--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but you got a reply from Central State--
Speaker 2: Right, I had--
Speaker 1: --which it seems to speak of some kind of collusion (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, it was--apparently, this is what the guy in the post office was doing, you know, so.
Speaker 1: Because there had been a bitter split between, I mean Wilberforce split, the state-funded portion of it, split off and became Central State.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And the original church side, you know, stayed on the same campus, you know, or remained in the control of AME [African Methodist Episcopal] church.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I think this occurred in 1947.
Speaker 2: Precisely, 1947.  And the only difference, I mean you could just walk, if you didn't know any better, you could just walk from campus to campus.  But there was a little ravine part of the way, separating it.  But, so we ended up on the state side, but I did not even know Central State existed until I got a response from the coach.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is in Wilberforce, Ohio--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --near Xenia.
Speaker 2: Four miles from Xenia, Ohio.
Story_ID: 23737
Speaker 1: Did you have a--was your chemistry teacher, would you consider him like a mentor?
Speaker 2: Well, not in high school.  I mean, but he was a good teacher because it was just fun doing--
Speaker 1: Well, I'm talking about at Central State [University, Wilberforce, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: At Central State.  Well, the organic [chemistry] professor thought I was probably arrogant, and we had a personality clash.  But there was an analytical chemist professor, Bernard Johnson, and he took me aside one day and told me, you're gonna fail my next exam.  He told me I'm not gonna get an A on it.  And I says, that's probably right, but if I fail it, Professor Johnson, the rest of the class will fail it too.  I'm a sophomore, I don't know.  I haven't learned diplomacy and all of that yet.  And so he just looked at me.  Then after that, I did undergraduate research with him, and we got along very well.  And so he was a good influence.  And, but this organic professor, Professor Wolffolk (ph.) and I, we just, we tolerated each other because the third year when I'm playing basketball, and I'd miss an exam, he wouldn't give me a make-up exam and which would lower my grade, you know.  But Dr. Bernard Johnson, he was a good, good guy.
Speaker 1: That seems, I've heard of these kind of conflicts before on campuses where the athletic department and the professors don't seem to be on the same page.  I mean you often hear that they are in collusion (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --you know, especially, in the high-powered athletic schools.  But here it seems to be a little different tension, you know.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, but that's the way humans are.  They make trouble unnecessarily.
Speaker 1: And you said this Professor Wolffolk (ph.) seemed a little bit challenged by your attitude.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes, yes.  But it was not, I thought not really true.  I mean I was always quiet.  I never said anything.  I just did my work.  And I, but for some reason--I do not know.  I just assume that sometimes you meet certain people, you know, even before you say a word, you do not get along.  And other people, but being a romantic on the side, I believe in love at first sight.  You could see somebody and fall in love in an instant.  Not everybody believes that, but I don't know.  Animals put off pheromones and attract or scare people away, scare other animals away.  So there are certain personalities that just clash.  So that was Professor Wolffolk and I.
Speaker 1: So you think there might be a biological basis for this (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I do not, I do not know--
Speaker 1: --the repulsion?
Speaker 2: --I just never understood it.  I just kept my mouth shut and did what I was supposed to do.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, Bernard Johnson.  Now, was he the professor that recommended you quit the basketball team?
Speaker 2: No, Wolffolk was the one.
Speaker 1: Wolffolk was, okay.
Speaker 2: And Wolffolk was the chair (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so now, at Central, so was there any--so you said, other than Professor Johnson, was there any other figure at Central State that inspired?
Speaker 2: Yes, there was one professor.  I do not remember her name today, but she taught History and Civilization.  And she was such a great instructor.  I mean I sat in that class.  I never took a note, but I remembered everything she said.
Speaker 1: Is this Dr. Wilhelmina S. Robinson?
Speaker 2: I, I do not know, I do not know.  I'll have to look in my yearbook.
Speaker 1: I think she was the only female teacher in the history department.  I mean I'm just remembering from what I remember from the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: I do not know.  It could be, but I'm gonna look in my yearbook when I get home.
Speaker 1: It could have been.
Speaker 2: But she was truly inspirational.  This lady was just absolutely marvelous.
Speaker 1: The thin woman (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, not too thin, no.  And she would present material and would just sit back to listen, such a pleasure.
Story_ID: 23738
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you have any memories of the president, Charles Wesley [at Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, in fact, I actually have maybe even a couple of pictures of Wesley and I and another friend, because we used to call ourselves the "Big Three" on campus.  But I sort of knew him because sometimes when we'd have student-body meetings and things, I've introduced him.  And then one, I was on basketball scholarship.  When the season's over, you work.  So I worked in the Office of the Dean of Women, and so I got to know the people in the administration building.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  I'm thinking, unless I'm wrong--you might not remember this, but I think Halle Q. Brown [African American educator, writer and activist] died in 1949.  Do you remember her?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I remember, I think the library was named after her, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think she probably wasn't working, I guess that last year she was alive.  I don't believe she was.
Speaker 2: When did she die?
Speaker 1: 1949.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was before I got there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's when you were in eighth grade, yeah, that's right, okay.  (Laughter) That's right, I'm forgetting that.  Yeah, so, yeah, you were in eighth grade then, starting high school.  Oh, we talked about Alice Windom [social worker] who was one of our HistoryMakers we interviewed in St. Louis [Missouri].
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: She was a fellow student, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, brilliant, absolutely brilliant.  You know, in the dorm other students used to get irritated with her during finals time because everybody's cramming and studying, and Alice is reading 'True Confessions' magazines.  She was brilliant.  She was brilliant, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you remember, now, she told us about an action that she took at the--there was a place in Xenia where you would catch the bus into Dayton [Ohio].  I think you'd go into Xenia.  Then there's a place, an eatery or a little store or something that segregated, you know.  And she defied them.  Do you remember that incident?
Speaker 2: Not relative to that, but there was incidents relative to the barber shop, and also relative to the fact when I first started at Central State [University], we had to sit in the restricted balcony area.  Now, while I was at Central State, I know those two issues were resolved.
Speaker 1: This is in a theater, that had a restricted balcony?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, movie theater (unclear) right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But there were probably other issues too.  And also while I was there, there was Professor Henry, I think is his name, got elected to the Xenia City Council.  But, see, Xenia, presumably, the history of Xenia was that after the Civil War, a lot of slave owners came, settled in that area along with their slaves and all those attitudes carried over.  But I think when I was at Central State between 1953 and 1957, those issues began to be resolved.  And also, not far from Central State is Yellow Springs [Ohio] where Antioch College was really sort of a very liberal kind of college.  But Alice very well could have been involved in something at the bus station in Xenia because in 1953, when I got there, it was tough in Xenia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23739
Speaker 1: Now, in terms of graduate school, did Professor Wolffolk [ph.; chemistry professor at Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio] help you get into graduate school at all?
Speaker 2: Yes, that was another interesting experience because I had pretty good grades.  And they were interested in whether or not some of the better schools would take one of their graduates.  So I think I applied to twelve or fourteen graduate schools.  And I got accepted by all of them, which it hurt Professor Wolffolk, but I think that's the only time he ever gave me a compliment (laughter).  But they were very pleased about that.  So, that was good.
Speaker 1: Okay, so all right.  So he was not pleased by your success?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, he, it's just our personalities were different.  You know, he's, he's who he is, you know.  It's hard--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it would seem to me that--
Speaker 2: --I did not dislike him.  That was just who he was.
Speaker 1: It would just seem to me if I was the chairman of a department in a small black college, and I had a student, a brilliant student who, you know, would easily pass everything and could be accepted to every graduate school, I would be eager to take credit for him (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, he probably did when I was not around, but it did not matter.  I mean I just sent in the applications.
Speaker 1: Okay, so where did you choose to go to school?
Speaker 2: To Michigan State [University].
Speaker 1: Okay, it's East Lansing, Michigan.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, this is, so you had gone to Marshall High School [John Marshall Metropolitan High School, Chicago, Illinois], so you weren't--you were used to being around a majority white population in a school.  So that's not a shock, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So this is 1957?
Speaker 2: Seven [1957], right.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what was the, had you decided to, had you given up on becoming a doctor at this point or--
Speaker 2: Well, yes and no.  But at that time, it was just sort of a long shot because there was no way I could get into medical school.  And if I could, there's no way I could afford it.  So then I was thinking, I was gonna make a military career, but I should first--well, what happened is that when I was graduating from Central State [University, Wilberforce, Ohio], they offered me a regular [U.S.] Army commission like the guys from West Point [United States Military Academy, New York] get.  And, but they wanted to put me in the Signal Corps.  And I was not too keen on that.  And so then I says, okay, well, let me just defer my commission as a second lieutenant and just go to graduate school to get a master's degree, okay.  So I go to Michigan State and I get to Michigan State.  I discover that if you had all As your first year, you could skip the master's degree and go straight for the Ph.D. [degree].  So I asked the Army for an extension, and they gave me an extension.  And so then that's how I ended up in the Ph.D. program at Michigan State.
Story_ID: 23740
Speaker 1: Now, who is your advisor at Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Professor Harold Hart.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what was your area of concentration and what was your dissertation eventually about?
Speaker 2: Organic chemistry, primarily dealing with small ring compounds, cyclopropanes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, tetracyanocyclopropanes it says here.  Is that what--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --is that correct?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Can you pronounce that for me?
Speaker 2: Tetracyanocyclopropanes.
Speaker 1: Thank you (laughter).  This is, I have a "wow" written next to this on the outline.  This is, yeah.  So what are they and what were you doing?
Speaker 2: Well, they, cyclopropane is just a small ring with three carbon atoms.  It's relatively strained.  And the, there is little chemistry known about cyclopropanes at that time.  And if you put on cyano groups, we say we're adding functionality to it.  We can convert it to other groups very easily.  So they get to be very useful in terms of organic synthesis to build more complicated compounds.  So my, part of my project was to synthesize them in good yield, convert some of the cyano groups to carboxyl groups or other organic functional groups.  And at this time, the NMR spectrometer was being developed.  So, in fact, Michigan State [University] had one of the first ones.  And so part of my project was to characterize the NMR spectra of these compounds.
Speaker 1: Okay, and NMR stands for nuclear magnetic resonance, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so you were basically measuring the magnetic--
Speaker 2: Environment of the atoms and the molecule which serves as a fingerprint identification.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Certain environments give certain patterns.
Speaker 1: All right, now, were you, I take it that Michigan State's facilities were a lot better equipped than Central [State University]?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes, but it was still an old chemistry building called Kedzie [Hall], but immeasurably better than Central State.  See, actually, Central State had a newer building.  In fact, it was Benjamin Banneker.  And I think one of his claims to fame was he helped to lay out the streets system in Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia].  But he was sort of a famous black chemist.  But the building was newer, but since Michigan State has undergrads, master's and Ph.D. programs, the equipment and all of that, although older, was just immeasurably better.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, how was your dissertation received?
Speaker 2: Well, I got three or four publications in journals and once they, you know, there's a committee, once they approve it, you get your Ph.D.  So I got my Ph.D.
Speaker 1: Okay, so three or four publications seems like pretty good (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, because some people still get their Ph.D. and they do not get any publications from their research.  But at that time, cyclopropane chemistry, especially substituted cyclopropane chemistry was a hot area, so we were sort of on the cutting edge at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23741
Speaker 1: Who was then, or can you remember who then was a leader in that field [cyclopropane chemistry]?
Speaker 2: Oh, I do not know because there are a number--well, actually, there were a number of chemists who were working with small ring compounds, which cyclopropanes are three-membered where there are three carbons in the ring, but they could be C-4, 5, 6 or 7.  And one of those persons were, was Professor [Kenneth B.] Wiberg who's now at Yale University [New Haven, Connecticut].  And another one was Professor Weinstein (ph.) at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles].  And another one might be Professor Streitrizer (ph.) at UC, Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley].  In part, because if you start with the three-membered ring, the cyclopropane, once you open up that ring, that's very reactive and undergoes a number of unusual reactions.  So, that's part of the reason for the interest in it.
Speaker 1: What are some of the unusual reactions?
Speaker 2: Well, it, the ring opens, well, the ring itself is what we call a saturated system.  It has all single bonds, but once you open up the ring, you can get a positively-charged species that we call a carbo-cation.  And then it all rearranges to different other structures.  And one can replace the hydrogens on the carbons, some of the carbons with deuterium.  And then you look for the deuteriums in other products so you can see what pathway the molecule took after you opened the ring.  And there are a number of pathways.  There're a lot of fundamental, what we call, physical organic mechanistic studies on that system.
Speaker 1: Okay, people are still studying it today, I would guess?
Speaker 2: Yes, but now we understand much more about it.  But once you understand it, then you can design or predict what it will do in a certain environment, and it becomes important in synthesis to make certain compounds.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, can you give an example of how some of that knowledge is used today?
Speaker 2: Well, in some cases in terms of synthesizing biologically active molecules that have some kind of health benefit.  There are certain structures that actually have the three-membered ring, and so we can build model compounds to screen against certain types of diseases.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a specific disease that they're being used on today?
Speaker 2: No, but I could look it up, but--
Speaker 1: Okay, but I was just asking.
Speaker 2: This is when?  1950s I worked on cyclopropanes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, well, after--you got your Ph.D. in '64 [1964]?
Speaker 2: '62 [1962].
Speaker 1: '62 [1962], okay.
Story_ID: 23742
Speaker 1: So what did you do next?  Did you continue to work there [Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Well, there is a slight interruption there because I think the idea was to get my Ph.D. by twenty-three [age] or something, but what happened is I got married in September, 1959.  And just before Halloween, about six weeks later, I had gone to the store to get some candy because we lived in married housing and all the kids were gonna come around for trick-or-treating in a couple of days.  And, but I tried this reaction that Professor [Harold] Hart [Freeman's doctoral thesis advisor at Michigan State University] said would not work.  And so I just did it in a test tube on a small scale.  So when I was coming back from the store, I thought I'd stop in the lab and, you know, see what happened.  And so I was looking at it, and I felt that it worked.  And there was another person, Harlow Morrick (ph.) who was working in the lab.  He just asked me what did I seem so happy about.  And so the [chemical] hood was here where I was, and then perpendicular to it, were the benches.  And at the end of that bench was this one guy, Phil somebody, who was working, who was known to be, have terrible lab technique.  And Harlow was standing there, so I went over to show Harlow the test tube and explain, you know, Hart said, Professor Hart said this would not work.  I think it's gonna work.  And the next thing I knew, I was on the floor, and I was all aflame.  This guy's experiment had exploded.  Instead of exploding 360 degrees, it just came off at an angle and hit Harlow and me, okay.  And it created such pressure, it was an implosion because the next lab was separated by a glass, sort of wall, so to speak.  It just sucked all that glass back in the room.  And all I know, I was on the floor and then I opened my eyes.  I'm all aflame.  And so, and eventually, we put the flames out.  Harlow ran out of the lab and down to the first floor.  So he ended up getting burned about 80 percent.  So he died a few weeks later.  I got burned about 40 percent, second and third degree.  And at that time, they had sort of a civil alert system when there's gonna be an emergency or big kind of thing.  So they sounded that so for all the doctors to come to the certain point.  So when they wheeled me into the emergency room, the doctors and the personnel just looked at me and walked out.  They said they were not gonna deal with it.  But luckily some guy, Dr. Packard came in.  And so they assumed I was gonna die and so, the good Rev. Freeman [Freeman's father, Millard Fillmore Freeman] and my stepmother [Mary Cora Tolbert] and my other relatives came up.  And so the good Reverend decided it was about time I joined the church and accepted God and, of course, one of my arguments with him was always, you should really believe in religion, not when you're suffering or you're down and out.  I mean it should be part of where your life.  And that's when the good Reverend says, "You're going to hell."  (Laughter) I was, not in a malicious way, just his response to my response.  So they assumed I was gonna die.  So a week later, I'm still there.  And two weeks later, I'm still there.  So they decided, well, maybe we can save this guy.  And so this was six weeks after I was married.  My poor wife, Patricia had--and I was in such bad shape, I was in isolation for seven months.  And she was the only one who was allowed to visit me.  And then somehow I survived after all the--actually, a walking, medical miracle, they told me.  So that was at the end of October, and they used to give me a shot every four hours for the pain.  It worked a few weeks.  Then after three hours, I would hurt.  They'd still give it to me every four hours.  So by December, I'm trying to convince this team of doctors, make me a drug addict so I will not suffer.  And then I'll kick the habit after I get well.  They says, no.  They've dealt with too many military people.  They do not kick the habit.  So it just, I'd just lie there, and I'd just hurt, hour after hour.  They had changed me from my stomach to my back every two hours to do that.  Now, the hospital had a Stryker frame which was for, let's say if I'm lying on my stomach, they sort of make a sandwich out of me, and the nurse could switch me over.  But somebody was using it.  So when I am there, they had to do it manually.  So they would make a sandwich out of me, and two of these nurses would flip me over.
Story_ID: 23743
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, we were describing off camera what happened, how they--
Speaker 2: But on this Stryker frame was the bad part in the beginning because when they were doing it manually, so I'm burned.  I'm in pain, the narcotic is not working.  But then they make a sandwich out of you, and then they flip--that used to hurt so much.  And then they had to change the dressings very frequently.  And there was this mean nurse.  She was so mean.  She used to, it used to hurt so much because with all the fluids and clotting and everything.  Then they had to moisten a little bit, but not too much to take off these things, otherwise, to do that.  And then finally, they put me on the automatic Stryker frame which was easier because it did not hurt so much.  And so in April or May of the next year [1960], I sat up on the edge of the bed for the first time.
Speaker 1: So this is like after how many months?
Speaker 2: Seven months, seven months.
Speaker 1: Seven months.
Speaker 2: Right.  And then I had to learn how to walk again.  I had to learn how to write again, learn how to pick up things again.  But in any event, that was late 1959, 1960.  And my poor wife [Patricia], she was there every day, but I felt so bad for, not only for myself, but also for her.  And that was an experience.
Speaker 1: Well, so this--did it take you a couple of years to get back to where you could go to--
Speaker 2: Well, it, now, see, after about seven months--once I got out of the hospital, things got to be better.  I was about twenty-two or twenty-three [years old], and if you're going to have this happen to you, that's the best age because your body can better tolerate it.  And so I got back in the lab later on that year and then finished up my Ph.D. in 1962 and came to California.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23744
Speaker 1: Now, tell us where you met your wife [Patricia]?  We didn't ask you that.
Speaker 2: Probably, I do not remember.  Either, probably at some social gathering or something, you know.
Speaker 1: Is this at East Lansing [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: No, this is was in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Oh, from Chicago?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because when I was in graduate school, I used to come home on the weekends, and then I had this old beat up car.  So I would bring other students with me on the weekends.  So we'd drive to Chicago.  And that was a way to make some money.  But the car was interesting because it was my first car.  It was an old Plymouth.  It burned more oil than gasoline.  I mean you could tell we were coming because this black smoke was coming out.  And so, anyway, I met her, and we just sort of just hit it off.  And so after we began romances for a while, we got married in September 1959.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 23745
Speaker 1: Are there any, were there any long-lasting effects of that [laboratory accident in 1959, causing serious burns], I mean other than the psychological trauma of all of it?
Speaker 2: Not really, just sort of limited motion in my elbows.  It turns out that my body chemistry just shifted to making a lot of calcium, and although, you know, they did physical therapy and all of that.  But it was, it's efficient that I was functional after that.  But after, other than that, no, you know, I'm okay physically.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 23746
Speaker 1: Now, what did you do between '62 [1962] and '64 [1964]?
Speaker 2: I worked for Standard Oil of California.  This is in the Bay Area [San Francisco, California], and it's a little--there's Berkeley and next to Berkeley is a little town called Richmond.  And next to that, there's a bridge that goes from Richmond over to Marin County.  And that's where the Standard Oil refinery was.  At that time, Standard Oil had a lot of administrative offices over on Bush Street in San Francisco.  And so I worked there for two years, and one of the reasons I went to work there was because they promised that we were gonna do basic research as opposed to industrial research.  Well, there were about eleven of us in basic research.  And that lasts for six months.  After that, as with any big company, profits drive everything.  And so we used to have these, what we called "dog and pony" shows where the people from Bush Street would come over, and we'd tell 'em what we're doing.  And all they wanna know is how much money is that gonna make us.  And so basically, during that two-year period, almost all of us had moved over, moved from basic research over to some industrial routine kind of work.  And out of the eleven of us, nine of us left, and became professors somewhere in the United States because, again, we had wanted to do basic research.  In industry, at that time, Standard Oil was one of the big people in the detergent industry because when they would crack petroleum to get these low molecular weight compounds, we all alkanes, and they could just put--and alkenes, and they could just put a sulfonate group on it.  So you needed alkane, alkene that's nonpolar and a sulfonate group that's polar.  So this is how you make suds and things.  The non-polar part gets out the dirt and the oil and the polar part (unclear) solubility.  But these things would not break down easily in the environment.  Streams were getting blocked and plugged up, and so we were just looking for ways to improve making those, but also to make alternatives.  So what you would do is to run a reaction and then you have to try all different concentrations.  So it's routine, the same thing.  Then you'd try different temperatures.  Then you'd add, change one reagent, and so industrial chemistry is necessary from the profit motive.  But intellectually, it's not very challenging.  It's very routine.  And so that's when I left to go back to Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] when I got a National Institutes of Health [NIH] post-doctoral fellowship.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is in 1964?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is a post-doc at Yale University in New Haven [Connecticut].  And--
Speaker 2: Now, the California Research Corporation eventually became the Chevron Research Corporation.  And so--
Speaker 1: Oh, the California, I mean the Standard Oil?
Speaker 2: Right, the California Research Corporation was the research arm of Standard Oil.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so now it is the Chevron Research Corporation.  And, of course, getting a job there was a big deal because growing up in Chicago [Illinois], I had always wanted to live in California.  But that was also part of the big migration in the United States to the West.  And there were not many jobs for chemists at that time.  Shell had a facility at Emeryville which is north of San Francisco.  And in Albany, California, there was a government lab.  So basically, those three labs, California Research Corporation, Shell and the government lab were the only ones that were hiring people.  So everybody was trying to get to the West Coast.  And that's when I was in Detroit [Michigan].  I went from Lansing [Michigan] to Detroit.  It was 13 [degree Fahrenheit] below [zero]. Got to San Francisco.  This is in January on my interview trip.  And they were having a heat wave.  It was 88 degrees.  Now, even since being a little kid, growing up in Chicago, I know I'm going to California.  And that trip just solidified everything.  There's no way I wanted to live back in the Midwest or where there was cold weather.
Story_ID: 23747
Speaker 1: So '64 [1964], you were at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] for a year [postdoctoral training], I guess?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you work on anything that, I mean is there anything there worth talking about in terms of research--
Speaker 2: Of course, because we were one of the world's experts in oxidation chemistry because when I got back to Yale, Professor [Kenneth B.] Wiberg was moving from the University of Washington at that time.  And he was also doing small-ring chemistry that I had done relative to my Ph.D. thesis.  So I thought this would be great.  But then this guy has ninety, I mean twenty-nine graduate students and post-docs.  Half of 'em are working on small-ring compounds.  So I realized, I cannot compete in small-ring chemistry, although that was my thesis work.  But another area that's very important to chemistry is oxidation mechanism.  And so that's when I started looking at permanganate ion oxidation and fast kinetics or reactions that happen very quickly.  So that's what I worked on with Professor Wiberg for that year.  Now, I was on leave of absence from Standard Oil at this time.  And I applied for jobs, and there were two possibilities.  One was at Santa--UC, University of California, Santa Cruz, and the other one was at California State [University], Long Beach.  And the job at Santa Cruz did not follow through.  And so Professor Wiberg is upset because I'm only applying to California schools and also Professor [Harold] Hart [Freeman's Ph.D. advisor at Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan] because he definitely wanted me to go to Bowling Green [Kentucky], but I was determined to go to California.  And so the National Institutes of Health [NIH] renewed my post-doctoral fellowship.  But I, my grandmother said, "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."  So that's how I ended up at Cal State, Long Beach in 1965.  That's where I started my academic career.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23748
Speaker 1: So what was the--were there any other black professors in the chemistry department at Cal [California State University], Long Beach.
Speaker 2: Even, oh, yes, eventually, we had one Professor Shoath (ph.) Leroy Shoath who left Long Beach and went to California State University at Hayward.  But I should point an interesting thing, at least I think, is that when I went to Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan] graduate school, there were three, including me, three African Americans in their graduate program.  There was no such thing as Affirmative Action, or anything in those days. So there were three.  I eventually got my Ph.D.  Harold Powell got his Ph.D., went to work for DuPont.  And the lady I think took her master's [degree] and started a family.  But this is in 1953--I'm sorry, 1957, to '62 [1962].  Now, I've been in the chemistry department at Cal State, I mean at the University of California, Irvine since 1973, so like forty years.  I'm in the chemistry department in the School of Physical Sciences.  We have the physics department.  We have the math department, astronomy and earth system sciences.  I am the only African American in the School of Physical Science in the last forty years.  In the forty years I've been here, they've only interviewed one African American.  I came in 1973 and for the whole campus, we have essentially the same number of African American professors in different departments, although the size of the campus has increased by 200 percent or 300 percent.  So University of California, Irvine, is a very special kind of place.  It does not like to hire black people.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it sounds like that, yeah.  But they're not by themselves, unfortunately.  A lot of places have a similar record.
Speaker 2: Oh, this is true, but, but I think in all the time I've been here, maybe we've had one or two African American graduate students.  And I think if I'm in graduate school back in 1957 to '62 [1962], and I do not know how the three of us ended up at Michigan State, but we did.  And now, we have all these programs and all these things, and things are not changing.  So, something is not right.
Speaker 1: So you think the perception that there's progress, at least in this instance, is a myth, right?
Speaker 2: It's an illusion, yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See, because we're graduating more black Ph.D.s than ever before in chemistry, not a lot, but we still are.  So they're out there, but some departments are hiring them, you know, but UC [University of California] is a tough place.  And so we, and--well, there's Bill Lester [William Lester, also a HistoryMaker] up at [University of California] Berkeley.  But there was another African American professor at UC Davis, who used to be at Howard University [Washington, District of Columbia].  And we're all retiring or at that age, so we're truly becoming an extinct species.  I mean it's just a fact of life.
Speaker 1: So when you retire, they'll have none.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it'll go back to what it was like in 1972 (laughter), wow.
Speaker 2: The history of UC [University of California], I do not understand, but we'll work on that a little bit, at least we're still working on it, but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --it's tough.
Story_ID: 23749
Speaker 1: Okay, now, in 1972, you became a visiting professor at the University of Paris [France].
Speaker 2: Seven, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, what happened is that I came to Long Beach [California; California State University] in 1965, and the state university system is primarily teaching.  You're not expected to do research, or you can do research, but I'd come from a research background.  So we started doing research.  And after about four or five years, you could only do a certain level of research with undergraduates and master's students.  So my future, I'd hit a plateau at Cal State, Long Beach.  So then I thought, well, I might as well go to law school because when I was at Yale [University, New Haven Connecticut], we used to always eat down at the law school.  And so, and then the Civil Rights Movement and all the demonstrations were going on.  And so it was just nice talking to these people and that kind of thing.  So I thought, okay.  So I was up for a sabbatical, so that's when I went to the University of Paris.  And my idea was when I came back from Paris was to start law school.  But then when I got back from Paris, the University of California, Irvine, invited me down to be a visiting professor because they wanted to see whether or not they wanted to hire me.  So I came to Irvine in January, 1973, as a visiting professor.  And so after two quarters, they offered me a position with tenure, and so that's how I ended up at University of California, Irvine.
Story_ID: 23750
Speaker 1: So they [University of California, Irvine] offered you a position with tenure--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, I had--
Speaker 1: --immediately?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, because I had tenure at Cal State [California State University], Long Beach.  I was not gonna go through that process.  But we had, really, we got lucky.  We did a lot of publications at Long Beach, and they know how difficult it is to do research at a state university.  And also, I'd collaborated with a microbiologist.  We did some things for the [U.S.] Army in terms of--at that time, the United States was concerned, were they gonna lose the Panama Canal or access to it.  And if necessary, they're gonna send American soldiers and engineers down there to handle the situation or to build a new Panama Canal.  But in that area of Central America, there are these little bugs that go around and bite people when they're sleeping.  And they get something that they call the Chagas disease [American trypanosomiasis] or Trypanosoma cruzi [flagellate protozoan that causes the diesease].  Well, at Cal State, Long Beach, there was this microbiologist, Dr. Kazan (ph.) who had an interest in that.  And some of the compounds that we were making, were very good against Chagas disease.  So we started doing that, and that was fairly successful.  But anyway, the government worked out its disagreement with the Panamanian government, and so that was the end of that money, and obviously, it's well, we don't need you anymore (laughter).  But I was, I don't know, it just--okay, scientists are not supposed to be superstitious, but I just happened to be at Long Beach at that time when Dr. Kazan was there.  The research projects that we did worked, and not that I planned it.  It just--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23751
Speaker 1: Were you in [University of] Paris [France] when NOBCChE [The National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers] was founded here?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure what year NOBCChE was founded.
Speaker 1: It was 1972, it says here.
Speaker 2: Yeah, about that time, but I was, I was not one of the founders, but I think maybe Bill Lester [William Lester, also a HistoryMaker] was and a couple of other people.  I went to a number of their early meetings and things in the beginning.  And I still go periodically to them and also to the regional meetings.
Speaker 1: That's the--
Speaker 2: But I am a member of NOBCChE.
Speaker 1: That's the National Organization of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 23752
Speaker 1: Are there any other, I guess I should probably--I don't know if I asked you enough about Paris [France]?  What was that like?  Now, you're out of the country now, and--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I thought it was fantastic.  It's still my favorite city.  San Francisco [California] is second, but Paris, I liked because I thought I was preparing myself to learn to speak French before I went, but I think fifteen minutes in Paris, I'd used up all my French.  And what I found striking was that there're all these black dudes who were speaking perfect French.  And then I realized that they had come up from the French colonies in Africa, you know.  And so I'm looking, and I says, it's absolutely amazing.  And then there was such a mixture of people.  In fact, when I was at the airport waiting to be picked up, it was like the world of all kinds of people were just passing me.  It was the first time I'd been outside the United States.  So it just sort of blew me away.  And so every day for three months, I went in the mornings, spent four hours in French.  And there was, you know, quite a number of Americans in Paris, and I learned that they'd been there for years, but they only talked to Americans.  They still do not speak French.  They could understand it, but they did not speak it, and I knew I did not want to hang out with them.  So I went to my morning class.  I watched TV, and in the afternoon, the French, I would go with the French chemists, and we'd go for coffee and pastry in the afternoon.  And so they were interested in practicing their English, and I was interested in practicing my French.  So it worked out quite well.  But one day, after we had had coffee and pastry, they went their way, and I went my way.  And I did not know whether we had talked in French or in English.  After about three months, finally, I had enough of a foundation.  And after that, it was pretty good.  And then the other part that was surprising, when you learned the language as an adult, you always have this American accent.  So I'd go shopping in Paris, and I'd say my best French.  And they'd say, ah, "Vous etes un Americain." You're an American (laughter).  But anyway, that was a good year.  I enjoyed that year in Paris very much.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Did you, I know a lot has been made of the black jazz scene in Paris, the black musicians.  Did you hear any of them?
Speaker 2: Yes, I went to a number of clubs and things and heard them, yes.  Have you been to Paris?
Speaker 1: I never have, but--well, I was there once in the airport.
Speaker 2: Okay, but you gotta get outside the airport.  No, it's an amazing place, but again, it's different now than it was in the '70s [1970s].  But the French people were interesting because at that time, in the 1971, '72 [1972], they did not much care for Americans.  And so when I'm talking to some of these people, once they recognized I'm from America, automatically, they do not like me, okay.  Now, that was the first time I ever felt like an American 'cause I'd never been treated like an American in America.  And, you know, Michelle Obama said something similar in a situation, said she felt like--well, it's true.  That is exactly how--these people were discriminating against me because I was American, not because I was a black.  That was the first time I felt like an American, and I'm an old man, in my thirties or something.  But so, when she said that and the press was giving her flack, I could very well understand what she was saying because--crazy world.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yes.
Story_ID: 23753
Speaker 1: So in '73 [1973], you're hired by the University of California at Irvine with tenure to come on.  And what's your load?  Is your day spent mostly doing research or teaching or--
Speaker 2: Ah, yes.  No, research.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, see, California has this three-tier system.  The community colleges, two years, all teaching. State university; there must be twenty-eight or twenty-nine of those.  And half of them encourage their young faculty to do research, but less than half of half really do research.  But if you're at the University of California system, 75 percent of your time is doing research, about 25 percent teaching.  And mostly you have to get research grants.  So if I get a grant for $500,000 and the university takes off 52 percent of that.  They get more of it for overhead (laughter) than I get to work with.  And actually, it's the overhead from the grants that run the University of California system.  The state maybe contributes a third, but it's having all of these high-powered researchers who bring in all the money from grants, and it's the overhead from the grants that makes the University of California as affordable as it is.  And so if you are in the University of California system, you're doing research, you're publishing papers, you're getting grants.  Otherwise, you're not in the University of California system.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that makes it different from some of the other systems out here.
Speaker 2: Right, yes.
Speaker 1: It makes the tuition lower, you're saying too?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. There was a time, I think there was a time within our lifetimes that education was free in California.
Speaker 2: Essentially free, no, this is true.  And it's just been going up and up every year.  Unfortunately, or fortunately, private schools have been going up a lot in the years.  So the University of California is still the best bargain, even--not only for undergraduate education and graduate education, but the professional schools are still the best bargain.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 23754
Speaker 1: What research topics were you focusing on here at UC [University of California] Irvine?
Speaker 2: Well, at one time, we were doing a lot of synthetic organic chemistry.  And we were looking at what we call organic mechanisms, how molecules and atoms get together when they act, when they react to make a new product.  We also did some things for the National Cancer Institute, and because some of our compounds were pretty good at killing HIV [Human Immunodeficiency Virus], HIV-AIDS virus and also against cancer.  So we synthesized a lot of compounds and the National Cancer Institute screened them for us.  And some of them were very effective, that is, that they would kill the disease or the virus in very low concentrations.  But they were not very discriminating.  They'd kill more and more cells which are--and so we stopped working on that.  And then I, we worked on a group of compounds called carbenes.  In fact, we're still working on carbenes.  And--
Speaker 1: Now, what are carbenes?
Speaker 2: Normally, a carbon atom will have in a compound, would have eight electrons around it and four bonds.  But a carbene would have maybe only six electrons around it and three bonds, which makes it very reactive.  And it can enable the researcher to do very interesting things in terms of reactivity because a carbene can, because of its great reactivity, will do things normal molecules will not do.  And there are a number of these that become, that are involved in a five-membered ring.  Rather than being just a carbon atom, we can have four of the atoms and make a five-membered ring and depending on the substituents, they have all different desirable properties.
Story_ID: 23755
Speaker 1: Now, in '76 [1976], you became an adjunct professor of chemistry at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  Is that true? As an adjunct?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I was on sabbatical, and if you go on sabbatical leave, they usually give you a title or something.  And so that was at the University of Illinois, Chicago Circle.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it wasn't at the University of Chicago.
Speaker 2: No, the University of Illinois, Chicago Circle.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, that's in your old neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, right.  That's when I noticed a difference on Taylor Street [Chicago] back in that area.  But, yep, Navy Pier [Chicago].
Speaker 1: Now, did your father [Millard Fillmore Freeman] still live over there?
Speaker 2: No, no, because actually, when I was at Central State [University, Wilberforce, Ohio], they moved out to the West Side, farther West from the Robert Brooks [housing] projects.  This is on Springfield.  And Springfield is 3900 West, Pulaski is 4000 West, Cicero is 4800 West, as you're leaving Chicago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23756
Speaker 1: We were just saying off camera that you knew Harold Charles who was also a chemistry student, a little bit older than you at Central State [University, East Lansing, Michigan]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --who taught at Farragut, since you just mentioned Farragut High School and thought of his name, and somebody--a very well-known activist leader in Chicago [Illinois], yeah.
Speaker 2: I'm not surprised.
Speaker 1: He had a column in the 'Defender' [Chicago Defender; newspaper] and everything, you know, yeah.  Okay, he died about three years ago, two or three years ago in Port Gibson, Mississippi, right, Port Gibson.  Okay, so you were at the University of Illinois at Chicago for just a year, right?
Speaker 2: Two quarters.
Speaker 1: Okay, two quarters.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is sabbatical time.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And were you working on something special there at the University of Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well, yes and no, but usually during sabbatical, you write manuscripts and grant proposals.  But they had a Czechoslovakian chemist, Professor Rochech (ph.; possibly, Rociak) was my host.  And he was also big in oxidation chemistry.  That's what we were doing a lot of in those days.  And so, you know, we interacted in, you know, in oxidation mechanisms.  And that's what I started when I was a post-doc [postdoctoral trainee] at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut].  So, that was part of the reason I was there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23757
Speaker 1: In '77 [1977], you became an Alexander von Humboldt Foundation Fellow?
Speaker 2: Right, this is from the German government.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, and so did you go to Germany in '77 [1977] or-- Oh, yes, yes, I was in Germany, I think for two quarters in 1977.  My host there was Noble Laureate Manfred Eigen [German biophysical chemist who won the 1967 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for work on measuring fast chemical reactions], and we were doing fast kinetics at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry. Max Planck [German theoretical physicist who originated quantum theory; won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918], now, he's the famous German chemist--did Max Planck win the Nobel Prize too? I, probably--if he didn't, he should have because he was very big early in the game. Okay, all right.  So in, okay, so you were working on, in Germany, you were at the--
Speaker 2: The Max Planck Institute.
Speaker 1: Max Planck Institute, and you were working on what?
Speaker 2: Fast kinetics.
Speaker 1: Okay, fast kinetics.
Speaker 2: This is still related to what I did with [Kenneth] Wiberg at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] and what I was doing at Cal State [California State University], Long Beach.
Speaker 1: Okay, in '78 [1978], you were a Fulbright-Hayes senior research scholar.
Speaker 2: Well that was also, but I was also at the Max Planck Institute for a quarter in 1978, and our, the way it worked out, I had both the Fulbright--the Fulbright was for a year.  But the Max Planck was broken up.  But they sort of overlapped.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you were still in Germany during this time?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: I was a senior researcher for the Fulbright, so--
Speaker 1: Okay, so I was just noticing, you know, how many times that you were, that you taught in Europe.  You seemed to be pretty actively--see, you were back here, I guess, in '78 [1978]--
Speaker 2: Yes, part of it--
Speaker 1: --at UC [University of California] Irvine?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, right, because--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I think things sort of ended like in the spring of '78 [1978], and I came home.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you stayed here Stateside [United States] from 1979 to '82 [1982], I guess?
Speaker 2: Yes, then I went back to Gif-sur-Yvette, which is just outside of Paris [France].  This was their Institute for Natural Products [Institut de Chimie des Substances Naturelles].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This was with Nobel Laureate, Sir Derek Barton [organic chemist].
Speaker 1: Sir Derek Barton?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, he must be British, I suppose?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, you get a Noble Prize, you become a knight.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, so what were you working on at that point?
Speaker 2: Then we were doing more synthesis of heterocyclic compounds.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But being the brilliant man he was, he had also worked on oxidation.  He worked on a lot of things, so it was part of our connectivity too because we both were looking at the oxidation of chromium compounds.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, was there a, sort of an overarching goal to what you were looking at, I mean what you were trying to find with the chromium compounds?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, again, we were looking at oxidation mechanisms, and we look at the oxidation of different types of molecules and things and try to deduce a mechanism.  And the reactions are very fast, so this is why we're doing fast kinetics and part of the reason I was in Germany because Professor Eigan got his Noble Prize for fast kinetics.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So you came back to the [United] States in '84 [1984], was that it?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no.  I--
Speaker 1: You were back before then?
Speaker 2: Yes, right, right, because I was, I think when I was there in '82 [1982], I was only there for one quarter or two quarters--
Speaker 1: Okay, so you--
Speaker 2: --probably one quarter.  And, but then I came back to the States, but then I went back in 1985 to Gif-su-Yvette to the Institute for Natural Products.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And this was just a short metro ride to Paris, so it, it's where I wanted to be.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you really enjoy France (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Story_ID: 23758
Speaker 1: When you come back [from France] in 1987, you were the, served as the vice chair of the chemistry department here [University of California, Irvine]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, and you're still the only black person in physical sciences in the entire university [University of California, Irvine], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in the School of Physical Sciences.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you served as vice chair from '87 [1987] to '89 [1989], right?
Speaker 2: Right, and toward the end of that I served as acting chair because the chair quit (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, are the other departments here at UC Irvine challenged, I guess, too, in terms of the multicultural composition?
Speaker 2: Overall, the campus is, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, is there like a black faculty and staff association or--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But at the university level, it's hard for them to do anything to really bring about a change.  It's not how the power system is set up.
Speaker 1: So if you're a black student in Southern California, where would you be more likely to go to school?
Speaker 2: Oh, probably UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles], but if I were in Northern California, I'd go to [University of California] Berkeley.
Speaker 1: Okay, Southern Cal, I mean, it would be UCLA.  Now, I heard something disturbing.  They had on the news that UCLA was deemed the most dangerous campus in the United States--
Speaker 2: Simply nonsense.  That's people misinterpreting data.  And I think Berkeley is on their list, University of California, Riverside.  It does not make any sense to me, but we'll know the truth eventually because usually all campuses are pretty safe, and I think especially in California.  But I think somebody's grabbing for headlines.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that made a big one, that there was a lot of pushback against it today in the news from people--
Speaker 2: It's ridiculous.  Westwood, no (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, now, what percentage of students here are African Americans?
Speaker 2: I don't know, but a very small percentage.
Speaker 1: Okay, so would this be one of the schools that's most unlikely to attract black students, do you think?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure on what premise that question is based because some black students will go to a school because there are other black students.  Other black students do not care.  There are black students that come here who will not even associate with other black students.  And I've gotten so many mixed messages, I just think it's more of an individual kind of thing because when we try to recruit--well, I used to be on the enrollment committee, and there was a consideration in recruiting minority students or particularly black students.  You bring them to this all-white institution, not all of them adjust to it very much, very well.  On the other hand, it does not make any difference.  But I think the majority would prefer to go where other black students are.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, but I get the impression this younger generation of black students is different.  I think it's, I'm not--have no data, but I suspect it's less important to them because there are black students here who do not associate with other black students, but they're perfectly happy in this world, whatever it is.  And I think that's probably increasing, and it may not be a bad thing.
Story_ID: 23759
Speaker 1: Now, in '89 [1989], you received a, you served a short stint with the National Science Foundation [NSF] as visiting scientist and program director of organic and macromolecular chemistry, right?
Speaker 2: Right, and I spent a year back in Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia].
Speaker 1: Okay, so were you basically reviewing applications, I mean proposals?
Speaker 2: In part, as program director.  The proposal will come in to the foundation to me, and then I get on the computer and find out, I need to find reviewers for these proposals.  So I look for people with expertise in these areas, send the proposal out for review, collect the reviews and then make a recommendation on funding.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23760
Speaker 1: So it seems in 1991, it seems you received a grant of $507,750 from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to study tropical plants in Latin America and Africa that fight various fungal diseases, viruses and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but that was in conjunction with Professor Eloy Rodriguez who was in the School of Bio [Biological] Science, so it was a joint grant.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and this is something.  Did you have much experience with folk remedies growing up?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, not experience, but I knew about them.  I mean if you got sick in the old neighborhood, there's no such thing as going to a doctor.  Everybody had some kind of folk remedy, many of which did not work, but that's all you could have.
Speaker 1: I just wondered if your family had any folk remedies, you know, that you remembered growing up?
Speaker 2: No, the medicine I remember most of all is Vicks VapoRub because of the way it smelled, and they'd rub it on your chest, and that's supposed to cure you when you got sick or have a cold.  But that was an interesting collaboration.  He's at Cornell [University, New York] now, but we inadvertently become, became sort of world experts in organosulfur chemistry.  And when I was in Germany, they had some money left over.  And they asked me did I want to go to a conference.  And so I looked around, and in Yugoslavia, there was an organosulfur conference.  And so I decided, hey, they want me to go so I will go.  So I went to this conference which was on the Adriatic Sea.  It's a place called Portoroz, and it's just like California.  This was when Tito [President Marshal Tito] was still in power in Yugoslavia.  But it was just capitalism.  It was a tourist place.  But it was, after being in Germany for that winter, it was so nice to get to this warm coast.  And these sulfur chemists were arguing about a particular reaction intermediate called an alphadisulfoxide. So, you know, I just said, well, we'll just, we can just oxidize this and oxidize that because we know how to oxidize things.  So everybody just laughed.  So I came back to the [United] States after Germany.  And there was a graduate student, Christos Angeletakis, a Greek fellow.  And he wanted to do research with me.  And we were looking for this elusive intermediate, the alphadisulfoxide.  And one way to do that is to work at very low temperatures so you could (unclear) the rate of reactivity.  And we were looking and we were looking.  We couldn't get any spectroscopic evidence for it.  But finally we did.  So we became the first ones to identify or to build an alphadisulfoxide.  And so we got into sulfur chemistry.  Now, to get back to Professor Rodriguez, he's the big world's expert on plant chemists, chemistry.  Now, there is this lady, Goodall, who studied the chimpanzee,--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Jane Goodall.
Speaker 2: You're right.  Well, when she was studying some of these chimpanzees, she noted that they would eat leaves from a certain plant.  They would just keep the leaves in their mouths.  They wouldn't chew it.  They'd spit it out.  Some of them swallowed it.  And so it turned out that some Canadian chemist was interested in this, Professor Rodriguez.  And so they started isolating the chemical components of this particular plant.  And it turns out that the significant component was some brilliant red compound.  It had a six-membered ring and all kinds of things on the side.  But in the six-membered ring, they had two sulfur atoms.  So since we were thought to be world experts on organosulfur chemistry, and that's when I started collaborating with Professor Rodriguez.  Again, all unplanned, but, you know, we've done a lot of sulfur chemistry.
Story_ID: 23761
Speaker 1: Relative to that, when you're talking about folk remedies, we did some things with Wakunaga Pharmaceuticals in Japan.  They are one of the big sellers of garlic.  Garlic is the oldest known herb used by humans, but many of their active, what is thought to be health benefits arise from organosulfur compounds.  Crazy world.
Speaker 2: Now, garlic is, yeah, I have friends in the natural food world that chew a lot of garlic, and they talk about the--garlic builds the blood.  I've heard all sorts of things.
Speaker 1: But it does have a lot of--see, what happened is that there're so many compounds in garlic.  We do not know whether it's a combination of several compounds that give health benefits.  So part of what we were doing with Wakunaga Pharmaceuticals, is we were isolating these compounds so we can test them individually.  And that, of course, is what the garlic people want as well as the pharmaceutical people because once we can isolate a compound that's responsible for health benefits, then they want to synthesize it and commercialize it.
Speaker 2: Okay, so there's some truth to it, garlic does have health benefits--
Speaker 1: Oh, it does for a lot of things, really.  It really does.  It's not known which component in the garlic.  There're hundreds of compounds.
Speaker 2: So that's still something that's being--
Speaker 1: It's still being investigated.
Speaker 2: --you know, worked out, I guess through research.
Speaker 1: That's what we're doing.
Speaker 2: What are some of the uses for garlic in terms of, or what are some of the benefits of--
Speaker 1: Well, you hear so many claims, you know, but certainly it has a, some effect on lowering cholesterol.  It works against certain types of cancer.  More recently, there's this sort of flesh-eating bacteria.  It starts with an "m" or something like that.  But garlic--
Speaker 2: MRSA [Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus]
Speaker 1: Mar something, I don't know what it is.  But, apparently, studies show that garlic has a way of working against that.  But I'll send you some references on that since we're working on this now.  But--
Speaker 2: MRSA, isn't it?
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.  There you, hey, that--it's amazing what's in that head of yours, young man (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: But actually, garlic is effective against that, which is surprising, but this is true.  And there are, there's another compound that has been isolated recently from garlic, and it's called Onion, Onion IN A.  There's some question about its structure, and we're interested in that.  But, apparently, the, I think the Japanese people have been trying this--it works against so many different kinds of cancer.
Speaker 2: It's called what now?
Speaker 1: Onion, with I-N, space A.  That's sort of a common name for it.
Speaker 2: Now, this is a compound in garlic--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --called Onion-IN A.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: Okay, we' just--well, they call it onion instead of--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Onion, well, because garlic and onions have a lot of the same compounds.  It's just a different genus.
Speaker 2: Okay, so some of the same compound that's found in--
Speaker 1: Garlic.
Speaker 2: --onions is--
Speaker 1: Found in onions, right.
Speaker 2: --as well, but there's more of it in garlic?
Speaker 1: Right, more different kinds, different ratios, right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But this one is particularly remarkable because it has a sulfur functional group which is our interest, but the functional group that people who discovered it, is--at least from calculations, is supposed to be very unstable.  So we suspect they have the wrong structure.  So we're working on that actively now.  So we should find out next year.
Story_ID: 23762
Speaker 1: Now, the sulfur compounds that provide the pungent odor of garlic?
Speaker 2: Yes, but there're hundreds of sulfur compounds.  But when people think they smell gas, it's a sulfur compound called ethanthiol because gas is colorless and odorless.  People could have a gas leak and never know it, and just putting a trace amount of this ethanethiol, and that's what people smell when they smell a gas leak or skunks, their odor is composed of these low molecular-weight sulfur compounds.  So when we used to work in the lab with low molecular-weight sulfur compounds, that's, they're very volatile in terms of their odors.  People just did not like it, but eventually, we worked with higher molecular-weight ones, so you do not even know we're working with sulfur compounds.  But any lab in the old days, if people were working with sulfur compounds, you knew it once you walked in the building or walked down the hall.
Speaker 1: Well, that's always the biggest joke of high school, somebody in the chemistry lab put, lets off some kind of sulfur-related stink in the school--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --and, you know, that's (laughter), it gives chemists a bad name.
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And they were, in graduate school, there were people working on sulfur compounds.  And their wives, when they get home, they had to leave their clothes outside, take a shower because it will linger.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, do you actually work with onions too, in terms of this?
Speaker 2: No, no, not--well, we've essentially, since we do not do lab work anymore.  We do mostly computational chemistry now.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the compound--I have a note here about, it's called allicin, is that--
Speaker 2: Allicin, that's another component of garlic.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, is that particularly important?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: Well, it's probably the--many people believe it's one of the major contributors to the health benefits of garlic.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the school's still out on this, huh, in terms of whether it is or not?  Or is it?
Speaker 2: Well, people are testing pure allicin, and we get mixed reports on the health benefits.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One of the problems is that it's a very reactive compound and rearranges to other compounds that apparently do not have health benefits.  And so when you have such a reactive compound, if you're measuring it against, for some health benefit, it depends on how you handle it because if you're not careful, by the time you put your sample into a reaction mixture, you may not have allicin anymore.  And part of the controversy is that, see, allicin is only available after you cut the garlic, you see, because there's an enzyme in there that reacts in such a way that generates allicin.  So a lot of these garlic preparations that people buy on the shelves, there's no allicin in there.  So it's sort of a hoax.  And then--
Speaker 1: Is it the cutting of the, I mean is it the, I suppose if you're making a garlic preparation, you have to cut it up or grind it up or something?
Speaker 2: Right, and then that's when this enzyme is released, which interacts with other compounds in garlic to make allicin.
Speaker 1: So for it to react immediately, you'd have to cut it or eat it raw or something and it's--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: I see.  I'm trying to understand the--
Speaker 2: Right, but if you buy some of these dried powders and things, there's just not gonna be any allicin in there.  And then even if you're doing an experiment, and allicin has a very short lifetime, less than seconds, and then if it rearranges to one of those compounds that have no health benefit, and you do not know that, you'll conclude that allicin doesn't have any health benefit.  So with these relatively unstable compounds, how you do the experiment becomes critical.
Speaker 1: Now, does, what happens to garlic, I mean other than making food taste good when you eat it, I mean, when you cook it?  I mean does it lose--
Speaker 2: It loses a lot of component compounds, but remember we're talking about hundreds of compounds.  And the lower molecular weight ones boil away.  The high-molecular weight ones will stay there.  Some of them will react with each other, different molecules.  A lot of chemistry goes on.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so would you think that cooking it destroys a lot of the, I mean the beneficial--
Speaker 2: It could do that, and on the other hand, one could speculate that it might convert some of the compounds to something that's beneficial.  That's what makes the studies and the papers we read about other people's studies so difficult--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because you get contradictory reports.
Speaker 1: So, we know that garlic is good, but, you know, it depends on how you use it and when you use it and what temperature it's at and--
Speaker 2: Precisely.
Speaker 1: --and even if it's cut or not or, you know--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's not an easy kind of problem to solve, but over a period of time, it will be, I mean you know.  People all over the world are really working on this.
Story_ID: 23763
Speaker 1: In 2001, you reported on the properties of di-tert-butyl chromate, is that correct?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) As he says condescendingly (laughter).  I'm doing the best I can (laughter).  So, tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Well, I think this was part of a, there's a series of volumes called E-R-O-S, EROS, Encyclopedia of [Reagents for] Organic [Synthesis] or whatever.  And so I wrote a number of short review articles on different oxidizing agents for that.
Speaker 1: Okay, the Encyclopedia of Regents for Organic Synthesis.
Speaker 2: EROS, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you just basically described what this was and what the properties of this--
Speaker 2: Yeah, because, you know, we'd done a lot of chromium oxidations.
Story_ID: 23764
Speaker 1: In 2002, just speaking to the fact that you're the only one [African American faculty member] here in [the School of] Physical Sciences [University of California, Irvine], in 2002, there's a study by Donna Nelson of Oklahoma State University [University of Oklahoma] that found that of the full-time faculty of the fifty largest university chemistry departments in the United States, there were no more than thirteen African American faculty.  And you're one of them, you and William Lester [also a HistoryMaker] and Billy Joe Evans [also a HistoryMaker] and, you know.  All right, and so we kind of discussed that.  Do you see hope on the horizon in terms of--
Speaker 2: No, because many of, some of us were hired, you know, as full professors.  And what we would like to see is that these departments are hiring non-whites as assistant professors or associate professors so they can develop in a system.  And if you look, there are not African American assistant professors throughout the country.  And this is a bad part about it because otherwise, they're just not gonna be there.
Speaker 1: So rather than seeing progress, we're actually seeing some kind of retrenchment, right?
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: The generation that produced you, I mean, the era that produced you is not producing a replacement.
Speaker 2: That's true.
Story_ID: 23765
Speaker 1: I just have a note here that you're the third most highly cited African American chemist in the country.  Did you know that or--
Speaker 2: I had some awareness of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did, now, you have the, you're involved in computational chemistry programs, right?
Speaker 2: Right, in fact, most of what we do is computational chemistry now.
Speaker 1: Now, this is what I, from what I understand, this is where chemistry is going now in terms of, you know, the image we have in our minds of the boiling, you know, caldrons, you know, the test tubes--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --you know, the beakers and that sort of thing, you know.  When you say a chemistry lab, we think of something that's like the Frankenstein lab where there's dry ice coming out of the, you know, but it's more computational now, with computer, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, but it's, it's to make traditional chemistry more efficient.  An example, if someone isolates a natural product, like allicin in garlic or from other source, well, pharmaceutical companies want to commercialize, but if it's a big molecule, then you want to see if it still has health benefits if you could take off parts of it.  See, that's what they do, and it makes it more commercially feasible.  Now, in the old days that I, all these synthetic chemists, you go into their lab, they do what we call brute force chemistry.  They know they've isolated this natural product.  It has some bio-activity, and then they start making all these kinds of derivatives of it.  But with computational chemistry, now, if you have an idea of the mechanism of reaction as a medicine, for example, you can design a molecule so instead of making a thousand compounds and screening them, you put it in the right computational chemistry program.  And it says, okay, here are the twenty likely candidates.  So what pharmaceutical companies are doing now, they're hiring fewer and fewer traditional synthetic organic chemists.  They're hiring newer, younger, organic chemists with computational chemistry backgrounds because you do not have to go this brute force route and make all of these things.  Now, one major success in that is the treatment of AIDS [Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome].  Someone discovered the structure of the HIV [Human Immunodeficiency Virus] protease which is necessary for the virus to replicate.  So once they got the structure of that, and then they could look at the structure and see likely receptor sites, and then you can design a molecule that will sit on a receptor site in the HIV protease.  And then it cannot replicate.  And this is what they did.  And so, this is what they do, is looking at pharmacophores (unclear) and different things.  And with powerful computers, now there's a lot of information out there.  And so in the future, we can predict things more accurately.  We do a pretty good job now in terms of chemical reactions, but in terms of medicine, in terms of biochemistry, that's the way it's going.
Story_ID: 23766
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now, you're a person who doesn't use a cell phone right now, you were telling me.
Speaker 2: No, I (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: But did it, were you--did you warm up to computers fairly easily?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, I had computers all around (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, that's true.
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.  But we do most, these are just to give us our access to the supercomputers so we do--we have a big cluster over there that we do now.  No, I've always used computers.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So you're--
Speaker 2: I'm all for technology, you know.  That's a, I think it's just absolutely amazing.  That's, one day, they will write the impact of computers on society.  It has revolutionized so many--they have revolutionized so many things.
Speaker 1: What is the horizon for the field of physical organic chemistry?
Speaker 2: Well, it's, it has had ups and downs, and in fact, that's what I was doing with [Kenneth] Wiberg at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut; postdoctoral research].  And then synthetic organic chemistry became the big thing.  So, but now we see a resurrection of physical organic chemistry in biochemistry because it's a matter of looking at reaction mechanisms.  And with--and you need an understanding of reactions mechanisms.  So many of the physical organic techniques we see in biochemistry now.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 23767
Speaker 1: Now, in 2008, you and Professor Gregory Weiss are awarded a National Science Foundation [NSF] grant to promote undergraduate chemistry research, I guess here at UC [University of California], Irvine?
Speaker 2: That's right, um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that was a three-year program, a three-year grant.  And the way it works, is that we have students come in from all over the country, also from Europe.  And mostly those that major in the STEM disciplines, science, technology, engineering and math for ten weeks and give them an opportunity to do cutting-edge research with our illustrious faculty.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, well, tell us about, now, you were saying earlier that you're close to retirement now.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: What are you working on now and what do you hope to accomplish, you know, while you're still here?
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, but also I'm, the grant was renewed.  I'm the only PI [principal investigator] on it now, so we're renewed for another three years.  And I don't know.  We got close to $400,000 this time.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's the National Science Foundation grant--
Speaker 2: Right, REU [Research Experiences for Undergraduates] program.  I'll send that to you.  And so now, as I get ready to be put out to pasture, I have to decide what I'm gonna do with all this free time on my hands.  But I'll continue to do research and certainly, part of my retirement agreement is to have access to the supercomputer on campus.  And that's primarily what I'll do.  I'll still do research.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 23768
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there anything major that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: Oh, probably, probably not, but probably I should have been more political and played more games that involves dealing with people more than I care to.  So, probably not.  I think there's so many things in life we do not control.  So sometimes I just let things happen.
Speaker 1: Okay, and likewise, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your major accomplishments or your legacy?
Speaker 2: Legacy, I never think of, but in terms of--I enjoy teaching or really mentoring students.  We've made some significant contributions to organic synthesis to reaction mechanism.  And that's part of research.  You have to, we are expected to discover new things.  And it's also a part of knowledge, and that's about it.
Story_ID: 23769
Speaker 1: Tell us something about your family.  Do you have children?
Speaker 2: Yes, four children, and three grandchildren.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you care to name your children or talk about them at all or (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Not at--okay.  So, daughter number one, that's Crystal Denise, born in 1961.  Now, I just smile, you know, when students ask me about my children.  I do not tell 'em how old they are, but my children are almost fifty years old.  And she was sort of an interesting child, still is, but she went to University of Illinois, Chicago Circle, straight As and undeclared, taking all of these introductory courses.  And usually they take away your scholarship if you do not declare.  But she was a good student.  So she went for three years undeclared, so they took away her money.  So, she formed an all-girls band around Chicago for about ten years.  And then she decided she wanted to get into aromatherapy in terms of selling it.  And they have all these nice world-wide conferences.  And then finally she settled down and became a, she's a psychiatric nurse now.  Now, next were a set of twins, Stephanie Marie and Stephen Mark.  And this was when we were living in California, and I was working for Standard Oil in California.  And in those days, we only expected one child.  So out comes one child and this nurse says, "There's another one in there." (laughter)  We did not know we were having twins until the day of birth.  And so that's Stephanie Marie and Stephan Mark.  Stephan Mark is a pilot for US Airways now, and Stephanie Marie is into business.  In fact, she got her MBA [Master's in Business Administration] at Northwestern [University, Chicago/Evanston, Illinois].  And so in contrast to daughter number one, who could never make up her mind what she wanted to do, Stephan Mark always wanted to be a pilot, all his life, straight through it.  And Stephanie Marie was very smart, very focused.  In fact, she went to one of these charter schools, Martin Luther King or somebody in Chicago because she thinks she went to school with Michelle Obama, who was there at the same time.
Speaker 1: Oh, charter school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's, I think it's--I've forgotten the name of it.
Speaker 1: Not a, it's not a public school, but it's a--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --charter school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, it was one of those, or a magnet school.  It was not the typical--
Speaker 1: Well, a magnet school, Whitney M. Young is the best one.
Speaker 2: Maybe it was Whitney Young.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --best one in Chicago.
Speaker 2: And so she went off to the University of Minnesota in St. Cloud, Minnesota.  And the cold weather did not bother her so much, but she missed black folks (laughter).  So then she left and went to Southern [University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] or Xavier [University, Cincinnati, Ohio].  So that's where she graduated and went to get her MBA.  So she lives in Naperville, just outside of Chicago.  Crystal Denise lives in Lisle, Illinois.  It's not far from Naperville, but I'd never heard of it.  And then child number four is Christopher, who went to undergraduate school at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and went to law school at Harvard.  I think he's teaching at Columbia [University, New York].  I have not talked to him recently, but at first the plan was him to get his undergraduate degree at Harvard and his law degree at Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California], but in a way, he liked New England.  And one of his famous statements to me is that if I'm nice to him, he'll put me in a nice old folks' home (laughter).  But his plan is to retire by the time he's forty [years old], so he's on his way to do that.  And so those are the four children.  And daughter number one has a son who's a junior in college in Chicago.  And Stephanie Marie has the twins, and the older girl, I think is in her first or second year at Auburn University [Auburn, Alabama].  And her sister, who is younger, is still in high school.  But they were pretty good at swimming.  The younger girl is still swimming.  The older one is not. Because they used to do well in the state meets.  But the older granddaughter did very well in some kind of Chinese speaking contest in the state of Illinois.  But in any event, I just got a note from her, and she's going to go to China to study for a short period of time, sort of like an education abroad compound.  But she's the granddaughter that her mom, Stephanie Marie, my daughter, used to have to fight with her to keep from reading.  That little girl just liked to read, and she is so smart.  And so all of them are doing well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 23770
Speaker 1: Do you have any hobbies or anything?
Speaker 2: Basketball, tennis.
Speaker 1: Okay, you still playing ball?
Speaker 2: No, in fact, I was on medical leave, actually, three years ago as of December 9.  They decided they wanted to do all these surgeries, so I took off.  I was on medical leave for a year, and I'm slowly recovering, you know.  So I do not play competitively.  I mean I go out and just shoot around and then I go out with my tennis ball machine and hit that.  But I suspect by next summer, I'll be playing mixed doubles competitively.  But basketball, that's a little too much.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My knees are worn out, you know, I kid Bill Lester [William Lester, also a HistoryMaker] about that too.
Speaker 1: Okay, Bill Lester, another chemist from--
Speaker 2: He's the one at [University of California] Berkeley.
Speaker 1: --UC, Berkeley, yeah, he was a basketball star--
Speaker 2: --(unclear) around Chicago [Illinois].  He (unclear) (simultaneous) at the University of Chicago, right.  And I listen to music, and, you know, again, I do not know because, that I will not be teaching, that will give me more time.  The first few years, I'll travel.  I have ex-students all over the world.  So I'm gonna try to see a lot of them.  But after four or five years, I'll just sort of settle down and do something.  But on the other hand, when I was born, I was looking at the statistics, for an African American male who was born the year I was born, the life expectancy was forty-seven years, okay.  Now, I never thought about it until I got to the university, and I'm reading all these things about social security.  It says, well, you cannot collect social security until you're sixty or sixty-five.  And how can my government be asking me to pay into a system they don't expect me to live to collect?  It just sort of, it's like reading about the black belt in Chicago.  I mean I never heard any discussion of this, but the idea that that's what social security is all about.  And so when I passed my forty-seventh birthday, I considered that an accomplishment.  So now, I'm seventy-six, about, so it's a major accomplishment.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Story_ID: 23771
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything I haven't asked you about we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No (laughter), I do not know.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, the last question is similar to legacy, but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I never thought about it.  It's not important (laughter).  It's not.  I mean when I'm dead, if my dad [Millard Fillmore Freeman] is right, I'll be in heaven.  Well, he (laughter), if there's a heaven, I'm gonna be there 'cause I lead a good life, and if not, that's okay too.  But if I've crossed over to the other side, I have no interest in what's back here.  I don't know.  I never thought about it, and then you hear so many comments about, different comments about dead people from different people.  And I do not know.  I've never thought about it.  It does not matter.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: I enjoyed the interview.
Speaker 2: It's been a pleasure (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: You've asked questions that have made me think about things I've not thought about for years, but I'm gonna call my brother, Alfonzo [Freeman], he lives in Virginia, and so he knows a little bit more about this, and at least his daughters, my nieces, keep up with it.  So I'll have to ask him about some of this old family history.
