 Little Thunder  My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Tuesday, October 23,  2012, and I   m interviewing Crystal Hanna as part of the Oklahoma  Native Artists Project, sponsored by the Oklahoma Oral History  Research Program at Oklahoma State University. We   re at Crystal   s  home right now, right between Sapulpa and Tulsa. Crystal, you   re a  Cherokee potter who apprenticed with Anna Mitchell, and you   ve gone  on to win awards at all the major art shows. One trademark of your  work is its elaborate graphic quality, and you   re now exploring some  ceramic dolls with your daughter. Thank you for taking the time to talk  with me.  You   re welcome. I   m glad you   re here.  Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  I was born in Claremore Indian Hospital, and we actually lived in Tulsa  most of our growing-up years. We spent a lot of time in Salina, where  my mother   s folks were from. All my full-blood relatives were there,  and we swam in the creek and ate crawdads and did all that good Indian  stuff. (Laughter)  What did you folks do for a living?  Before my brother and sister were born   when I was six my sister was  born, but before that my dad was a fisherman, and he literally fished the  creek banks and rivers and lakes in Oklahoma for catfish. That   s how he  made a living for me and my mom. We caught catfish. He cleaned them  and went to the parks or went to little towns and sold his catfish, and he  called himself Nature Boy. (Laughter)  Did you help at all with that?  5  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  I don   t know that I helped a lot, but I can tell you that it was a childhood  experience that most kids would never have an opportunity to have. I  wouldn   t trade it for the world because we really didn   t even live in a  home until I was six. We lived on creek banks. We had tents. I  remember one time we had a bus, and Mom cooked out on an open  campfire. It was just incredible. I didn   t know it at the time, but it really  was. (Laughter) Then when I turned six and my sister was born, he had  to settle down. We had to move into a house. His dad had been a roofing  contractor, hot-tar roofing, and that   s what he knew. He started his own  business when I was six, and that   s what he did until he passed away in  the mid-   80s.  How about your mom?  Mom was full-blood Cherokee. She never worked outside the home. She  spent her time raising us kids. She did a pretty good job, for the most  part anyway  (Laughter)  So were you speaking Cherokee growing up?  When I was young, actually before my sister was born, because we spent  so much time at my grandmother   s house in Salina, and that   s all they  spoke was Cherokee in the home. So, yes, I was picking it up, and I  learned it. Because Cherokee was my mother   s first language and it was  really hard for her when she started first grade, she said the kids made  fun of her, so she said no. They would teach us little words, but for the  most part, she says,    My kids are going to speak English because they   re  not going to go through what I did.    I was caught in that generation  where it just wasn   t the thing that my mother thought we should do.  Now we know better, and if she were here now, I know she   d want me  to be learning Cherokee, which we do a little bit on our own as much as  we can.  How about your relationship with your grandparents on either side?  On my mother   s side because we spent so much time with my Grandma  and my Grandpa Chuckluck   my grandfather was Bridge Chuckluck,  and my grandmother was Annie Chuckluck. Actually, my grandmother  was a translator. I   m not sure exactly when, but probably before I was  born because my mom was the oldest of six living kids. But I know that  there was a time that she was a translator in Salina. I don   t really know  for what organization, but she did work as a translator at some point in  time. My grandpa, he was just always there. (Laughs)  What was your earliest memory of seeing art?  6  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Earliest memory. Well, probably when I saw my own dad. He liked to  draw things that he saw. He liked to draw horses and things like that. We  always doodled, but as far as going to art shows or going to museums, I  really wasn   t raised like that. My mom wasn   t raised like that, and so it  was   art to us was what we saw in Nature and what we loved. What we  saw, that was our art.  So I   m wondering if it was easy for you to come by pencils and paper,  given that     Yes because I went to a public school on the east side of Tulsa, Mingo  School. I went there from first grade through eighth grade. It was  actually a pretty wealthy public school because it was right there by  McDonnell Douglas and American Airlines, and so we had a lot of  opportunity there maybe that I might not have had in some other school  district. But you know, we always had everything. We had art. I did take  art classes. I think you could start in fifth grade, so that was kind of fun.  Did you have any other family members who were interested in art, or  extended family?  No, none.  So what is your earliest memory of making art or doing art?  I   m sure as a child we made our mud pies and we decorated them, but  nothing, like, formal. We never had any art contests or anything like  that. Even in boarding school, we weren   t exposed to any art or any of  the traditional arts like beadwork. We didn   t really get any of that. Now  I think they are going a little more toward teaching the kids, even at a  younger age, more of what   s artistic and what isn   t.  How would you describe the background that you got in primary  school? Were you interested? Was the experience with art   did it impact  you?  Not really because, to me, it was all about sports and athletics and  basketball. I took art for a couple of semesters in grade school, but for  the most part not any through high school or the little bit of college that I  had. Nope, no art.  And you went to college where?  Went to Northeastern. Back then it was Northeastern State College.  Went there a year and a summer. My husband was graduating, got  married, and started having a family.  7  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  So you were raising the kids. Were you working part-time when they  were young, too?  Worked full-time from the very beginning. Took a little bit of time with  both of my children when they were born, but for the most part I   ve  worked full-time for forty years, a long time  (Laughter)  And you   re also out in the country from the beginning?  Oh, yes. We   ve always lived out.  So you   re raising horses and     I don   t think I could live in town, for sure. (Laughter)  What about the first time that you saw Indian art, Native art?  Really, the first time I was interested or thought I might be interested  was in 1998. As I mentioned to you earlier, I was sitting in our bank  waiting to speak to a loan officer, so I could probably borrow some  money for my husband   s horse or something. (Laughter) There was a  brochure. It was about Red Earth, and Anna Mitchell had been named  the Honored One for Red Earth that year. I read the article, and she so  intrigued me. She really reminded me of my mother. She was full-blood  Cherokee. Her look even reminded me a little bit of Mom. That   s when I  called Red Earth, and I said,    I   m not sure why, I   ve never done this  before, but I really would just like to meet this lady. She sounds so  incredible     That   s when they said,    Well, we really can   t give you her  number, but we   ll call her, and if she wants to, then she can call you.     And she did. She called me the next day. I was at work, and I was just  like,    Oh my gosh, this lady has called me, and she said I can come to  her house and visit     I did that very next weekend.  I took my husband   s aunt, went up there, and we went a Sunday after  she got out of church. We visited all day, and she showed me her  pottery, how she did it. She said,    You know, Crystal, I think that you  might make a good apprentice.    I kind of looked at her, and I go,     Really?    Then I thought about it a moment, and I really got chill  bumps. It was like,    Anna, I think I   m supposed to be doing this.    I   ve  never really felt that way about anything, but I was at an age   my kids  were grown, both my kids were out of college, and I was like,    Okay,  now I   m looking for something to do.    This was in October when I met  her, of 1998, and she says,    Well, I start working on my pottery about  the first of March.    She says,    I   ll call, you and you can come up.    She  says,    Now, you can do an apprenticeship, but I have to tell you now, I  8  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  charge five hundred dollars for this, but you can pay me out however  you want. It doesn   t make me any difference because I can see that  you   re really hungry to learn more about this.     But before you start making any pottery with me, here is a list of books.  I want you to go to the library, look on the Internet, buy books, whatever  you need to do. I want you to do as much research as you can about the  Southeastern Mississippian culture before we ever make our first coil.     It was the best advice she ever gave me. I went crazy  From October to  March, that   s all I did. I was obsessed with it  (Laughter) We started,  and we had probably like a three-month apprenticeship where I went on  the weekends.  Every weekend?  Every weekend, and we did everything from scratch. It was an incredible  experience.  Take us through that a bit. You would go out, and would you dig your  clay each time?  Because I would go on a Saturday, I   d go about ten o   clock, get there  about ten o   clock in the morning on a Saturday, and we went through  each step. One of the steps, of course, is processing the clay. Well, Anna  had a really great sense of humor. She had a huge sandstone slab in her  backyard that had a big dish in it. She handed me this, like, it felt like a  five-pound rock, little round rock, and she says,    Now, here   s the clay  that I already have settled for you.     It   s all hard, and it looks like rock, and she wanted me to grind and grind  and grind. Now, you know, it   s still pretty warm, like in the end of  March. I did this for a couple of hours, and the sweat   s like pouring off  of me. My back   s hurting, my arm   s hurting, and she says,    Well, I just  want you to know how our ancestors did it and how they felt whenever  they were doing all this work, but there is a better way to do this      (Laughter)  Then she showed me how you could actually put the dry clay in a  bucket, let it soak, and then put it through a strainer and let the water go  off of it. She was great.  She wanted you to have that experience.  She did. I   m sure she was laughing behind me all the while just to see  how long I   d stick it out. (Laughter)  9  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  And she commented many times that it was all about the culture, too,  learning the culture.  Absolutely.  What things did you learn that you maybe hadn   t been as aware of?  One of the things that really Anna impressed on me was she had me do  the research and she had me   in fact, she had a great library, herself,  because that was one of the things she was a real stickler on. She says,     Study the shapes. I   m teaching you the basics, how to gather the clay,  how to clean it, how to do the coil building.    She always said,    You  know, the technique is not that hard to learn. Perfecting it might take you  a little while, but practice. Anything that you work hard at, then it   s  going to pay off at some point. What I want to impress on you, stay  within our culture. I do not want to see you putting Kokopellis on your  pottery  That   s not us     (Laughter)  I understood what she was saying because a lot of times when I   m  making my own pottery and I   ll look at designs and things   and some  people have even said,    Well, isn   t that kind of like copying?    I go,    No,  I don   t think so,    because what I learned from Anna was to look at the  shapes, the designs, the techniques, but put your own identity onto it.  That   s one thing that I really try to do.  I love the effigy pieces, but you can make ten turtle effigies, but none of  them are ever going to be the same because they might start out as a  turtle but they might wind up as a fish  (Laughter) Sometimes the clay  does have a mind of its own.  What were some of your early pots like?  They were cattywampus. (Laughter) That would probably be a really  good word. I worked with Anna for the three months, and I   d bring clay  home. We processed a huge, huge tub of clay. It was actually some clay  that her husband, Bob, had cleaned. What he would do is clean the clay  for her, and she would grind it up. She had it in containers out in her  workshop, and that was some of the first clay that I used to make my  first pieces of pottery with. Then we had some that she had found either  on her place or a place near Vinita. It was a huge tub. It was enough clay  to keep me in business all summer.  After I   d worked and made all these pieces all summer, I go,    Anna, I   ve  got, like, fifteen pieces of pottery here, and I don   t have that many  relatives that even want my pottery. What am I going to do with all this  stuff?    (Laughter) She says,    Well, I just got an invitation from the  10  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Bartlesville Indian Summer Festival. I   ll give you the application, and  you have to send in some photos.    I go,    Anna, they are not going to  want my stuff at all.    She says,    Oh, yes, just send out the stuff.    I  mailed it to them, and I waited and waited because I did not think that  they   d want my pottery. I think the booth fee was like  250, and I   m  thinking,    Oh my gosh      I finally got my letter. They sent me my acceptance, and we went     actually, Anna and her daughter, Victoria, went with me to the reception.  I   d entered a little turtle effigy that we had worked on, she and I had  fired. I had actually brought it home and blackened it in my oak leaves  and horse manure mixture. It won, like, first place in traditional  category, which was like  300. I was like,    Oh my gosh, this is really  cool     (Laughter) I have all these pieces and I sold out  (Laughs) Anna  was there when I won my ribbon, and she encouraged me from the very  beginning. If I ever had a question, I   d pick up the phone and call her,  and she was just always there for me. It   s kind of hard because we all  still miss her so much.  Did she help you price your first pots?  My very first piece that I sold was to one of her collectors. Her name  was Florian Griggs. She and her husband were a big supporter of that  Bartlesville Indian Summer Festival. I think I said,    Maybe I can sell  this for, like, twenty-five dollars.    Anna looked at me, and she looked at  Florian. She says,    No, I don   t think so.    She says,    A hundred dollars.     My eyes got big, and I was like,    Whew     (Laughter)  I know what it took to get here, but because I hadn   t really been around  art or the art market or really knew that much about it, that was my first  Native American art show, the one that I was in. She really set my  standards very high. One of her comments that I remember her making  is her neighbor wanted Anna to make a candy dish. She told that lady  very politely, she says,    That   s not what I   m about.    And she never was.  She kept her art so true and so traditional that she really has set the  standard for anybody that does traditional pottery making. I   m glad she  set it high, and I intend to stay right there where she wants me to be.  (Laughter)  So were your pots from the beginning sort of decorative stoneware?  They   re not necessarily meant to be used, but they were     That is correct, I mean, because we   re trying to preserve this traditional  pottery making. It   s actually earthenware because it   s just earth, clay,  that we dig out of the ground and hand-process ourself. While our  ancestors did use it for functional use, and it probably could be used for  11  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  functional because we do want to keep it elevated to the point where it is  a fine art. I try to stay with Anna   s lesson in trying to make it more of an  art form. Some of it could be functional, but for the most part I would  say it   s something that we want to have as collectible, something that  could be in someone   s home that they   re proud of and they know the  history of it, and they know why we make this. It   s always an honor  when someone purchases a piece of my pottery for their home or for a  collection or for a museum. It   s a great honor.  So, did you then   were you bitten by the bug? Were you ready to do  more shows immediately?  Yes, that first show in the fall of 1999. People come to those shows that  promote other art shows, so that kind of led to a few shows the next  year. I think because Anna was still doing the Santa Fe Indian Art  Market, I went out there with Anna and Victoria when they did the  Market. In 2000, I didn   t go with them. In 2001, I did go with them just  to see what Art Market   that really opened up my eyes to what Native  American art collectors really are about because if we ever, ever get to  the point in Oklahoma with our art shows to the standard that Santa Fe  has with the buyers and the collectors that understand about the artwork,  then we will have actually done what Anna worked so many years to get  to.  While I know that we have people that appreciate the artwork, I don   t  think we have the level of understanding that they do out there. They   ve  been doing it for how many years now? I don   t know. I can   t remember.  Seventy-five, eighty years? Maybe longer. I can   t remember. We   re  getting there. Like the Cherokee Art Market, the Chickasaws, the  Choctaws, the Creeks, they   re all doing their part to get us to that point.  Did you notice a different reception for Five Tribes pottery at Santa Fe  Indian Market from     The Pueblos and the Navajos, the traditional potters, they do the same  thing that we do, (they go out and hand-dig their clay and process it) but  because our pottery is different than what people understand, people  recognize Southwest pottery in an instant, anybody, no matter if you are  a pottery collector or not. Ours is not quite as recognizable just because  the designs and shapes are a little bit different. My own personal  experience is that it   s been well-received. I   ve done the Market now for  ten years, and every year has been, I would say, fairly successful for  someone like me, who   I   m not a full-time artist.  It   s a great opportunity for me to go out there and show my Southeastern  Mississippian style of pottery. The collectors are getting more familiar  12  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  with it. I know Jane Osti goes out there, and Bill Glass, and we have a  new Caddo potter going out there. There is a lot more exposure to our  style of pottery, so it   s going to be highly collectible as well. (Laughter)  When did you start meeting other potters besides Anna?  That first spring and summer I met Victoria Mitchell, Anna   s daughter,  and we worked quite a bit together and did a few shows together the first  few years. Then I met Jane Osti, and Jane   s pottery is incredible. I   ve  always aspired to become half as good as Jane is. If I ever get to that  point, I will actually feel like I   ve succeeded. By doing the art shows,  you do meet so many incredible artists. For me, doing the art shows is  like   I know whenever I see the art there, I need to step up my own  game a little bit, not a little bit, but a whole lot because we have  incredible Oklahoma artists. It   s wonderful.  What   s the best piece of business advice you got from another artist,  maybe not necessarily another potter?  I think one of the hardest things for me is pricing my own artwork  because I might have something that I worked hours and hours and  hours on with, and it   s not, like, really what I wanted it to be. I had an  artist friend tell me, (another potter, he was non-Native) he goes,    Well,  what you do is you have your pottery here, and you have a twenty dollar  bill. Start with that. Do you want this twenty dollar bill, or do you want  the pot? Well, maybe you want two twenty dollar bills or the pot.     You graduate to the point,    Do you want to keep it, or do you want the  money?    So that was kind of a funny way to go about it, but it is hard. It  is hard to say,    What is this worth?    to someone else, or,    What is it  worth?    to yourself. It is kind of a difficult thing. You could always     how many hours did you put in it? That doesn   t really work for me, but  maybe it does for some artists. It   s hard to know what is going to sell  and what isn   t going to sell. You just have to make what you like and do  the best you can.  So what was another important award for you?  The very first year that I got accepted into the Santa Fe Indian Art  Market. I actually got on the waiting list, and my number was three.  They said,    Your chances of getting into the market are great, so go  ahead, keep making your pottery just like you were going to come out  here. In fact, you can come out because someone   s going to sell out and  then you can move into their booth, but if you do come out as an artist  on the waiting list, you can   t get into the artist competition.     13  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  It was like,    Well, yes, I   m going to go. I   ll do that because I   ve got  some nice pieces and I   ve been working all summer.    Three weeks  before the Market, they said,    Oh, you   re in.    They gave me a tiny little  booth behind F M Bank, and I was just so excited to be there. I entered  an effigy bowl. It had the head, an oblong bowl with a mace handle. I  entered it into one of the categories, and it won Best of Division where  they had like the A, B, C, D, E, F, G. It won, like, G.  Wonderful.  It was like,    Oh, my gosh     Victoria was with me, and Anna was there.  We didn   t sleep all night long  (Laughter) And we had to be there at like  five o   clock in the morning to set up. It was an incredible experience.  It   s just knowing that the judging recognized that art form, the  Mississippian Southeastern traditional pottery. It was amazing. That was  probably the best show that I can remember being out there. I have won  other ribbons out there, but that was definitely   I don   t think I   ll ever  win a Best of Class, but you never know. I   m still working toward that.  (Laughter)  Can you describe, because there   s sort of a phenomenon if you win a  prize out there.  Oh, there   s definitely a phenomena that goes with it.  What happens?  Well, on preview night (it   s on Friday night) people have to pay their  fifty dollars if they go to the general preview just to go in and look at the  pottery, and you can   t sell anything. When you win a ribbon, though, it  does carry a little weight with it because the collectors are there and  they   re writing the names down and seeing where you are. That  Saturday morning of the first year I went out there, I had several people  before I even had the pot on my table, like,    Okay, I want that pot that  has the ribbons with it.    They   re usually waiting for you before you ever  even get it on your table, so it   s pretty nice. We don   t do that here yet,  but we   re going to. (Laughter)  Did you take any other workshops after working with Anna?  I   ve taken a workshop from Bill Glass, and we did more sculptural  pottery just so you could learn a little different technique. Actually, he  taught us really nice technique that I believe he said he learned from  Allan Houser when he was out at IAIA  Institute of American Indian  Arts . But mostly I   ve taught workshops. I haven   t really taken a lot  from other people.  14  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  But you did learn how to do gas-kiln firing?  Yes, basically I taught that to myself because it   s not that hard.  (Laughter)  It   s a two-person business, the art business. Has your husband been able  to play     My big supporter in my family is my daughter, Jackie, from the very  beginning. In fact, she can make coil pottery, as well. She got bit by the  bug by Martha Berry with the beadwork. She   s made several bandolier  bags and really didn   t do it for a long time because her son was still  young and very needy. Now he   s seventeen and going into the Army, so  she   s getting back into her beadwork, and we   re starting our historical-doll  project. We   re looking forward to that.  Can you explain a little more about that?  I   ve wanted to make dolls for about five or six years. My idea was that I  would do the head, from the neck up, and then we would do cloth dolls  for the body but make it a historical project where each doll can  represent a time period, and then do the research and make sure the  clothing, all the attire, is proper to that time period that we   re writing  about.  She is a great writer, so she does all the write-up for each doll. Dolls are  a significant part of every culture, not just Native American culture.  Every culture has had some type of doll, so, to me, this is kind of our  contribution to keep our history alive and be able to document it as we  get along with our own stories and our own research with each doll.  We   ve made one. (Laughter) It   s a beginning   I look forward to seeing more. Talk a little bit about giving a workshop.  What was the first workshop that you gave?  The first workshops that I did, I did with Victoria Mitchell, and the  Creek Council House had invited us to come down there and present  workshops. Basically, it   s teaching the processes, even, I guess, solving  some of the mystery, like    How do you get the clay? Are you sure? Will  this make good pottery?    Like Anna said and has told me, the technique  of coil building is pretty simple. It takes some practice to get it to where  you want it to be. For most artists, we never get there. I think that   s what  keeps us going.  Then the firing, that   s a real mystery. I always tell kids or adults, it   s  15  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  basically simple chemistry. You have clay, it has to harden, it has to dry,  all the water has to be out of it, and you have to do a slow firing process  so it can go from clay to ceramic. You can do that with wood.  How do you think giving workshops has impacted your own work?  A lot of times I really   not a lot of times, most of the times, I enjoy  teaching the workshops more than I do the art shows themselves. The art  shows can be rewarding because people appreciate your work, and they  pat you on the back, and they say,    Oh, did you make that? Oh, that   s  great.    But teaching is, I guess, Anna   s legacy is what I was going to say  because that was what she did. She wanted her legacy, what she learned,  what she was self-taught, to me, to Victoria, to Jane, so many people that  she influenced with her own high level of expectations for what it should  be. That   s what we want to do. We want to pass it on to the next  generations. Now I have three granddaughters, so we may even have a  generation thing going here pretty soon. (Laughter)  I wanted to ask you about giving workshops in Georgia. I don   t know if  that was your first time going to some of the homelands.  Let   s see this is 2012, so in 2011   I think it was April of 2011, the  Cherokee   I   m sorry. I can   t remember the name of the project, but they  had a, basically it was an artist-in-residency program where you go to     we went to northwest Georgia. Actually, my aunt went with me to  Dalton, Georgia, I think, northwest Georgia. There was not a single  Cherokee child to be found. (Laughs)  The concept was you went there   actually, we went from grade school  all the way up through high school and did several workshops each day.  We did the mini-presentations so that they would actually have exposure  to the people that had lived in those lands before them that are no longer  there but hopefully had an impact on what was there before them so that  they could have some knowledge of that. That was a great experience.  The kids and the faculty members, we were well-received. They  provided us with a place to stay, and I wish I could remember the name  of the group that really sponsored that. I know part of it was through  Cherokee Nation, but there was like a sponsorship program.  I wanted to ask you if you had a chance to do any research,  Mississippian research maybe, while you were in Georgia at any of  those museums.  Because I had such a hectic schedule and I was only there for a week     like one day was driving. It seems like we got there on a Sunday, and we  started right off on Monday. We   d do, like, three schools a day, so it was  16  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  pretty busy. They actually provided us with a place to stay just right  outside of Dalton. The little cabin that we stayed in was a family place  that had been in their family for years and years, and there was no TV,  no radio. (Laughter) It was really a nice quiet time, went to bed, got up,  and started in the next morning.  But you have gone to North Carolina. You   ve shown at Qualla  Arts and  Crafts  before?  I haven   t actually shown or done any workshops or done any of their art  shows out there. When I first started with my pottery, I did feel  compelled that I needed to go visit the ancestral homelands, and so my  daughter and my grandson, who was only five at the time, we drove out.  I took a vacation.  Our first stop was in Helen, Georgia, where some of Anna   s friends  were. They had that Tekakwitha Art Gallery, and we did a little  workshop there with that little gallery and spent the night with the  Lammers es , who own the gallery. Then we went on to Georgia the  next day and stayed with some of Anna   s friends, Betty Dupree, who  actually had run the Qualla.  Museum.  Yes. Well, no. It   s actually a co-op, the Qualla Co-op. She was very  cordial to us. She showed us around town. We went to the gallery, and  we went to the museum, which was really incredible. We went to the  plays out there, so it was a vacation. It was pretty moving because the  Cherokee people we saw there looked like my cousins. (Laughs) It was  moving in a way that   s kind of hard to explain just because if I   d been in  a different family or things had happened differently, I mean, I could   ve  been there instead of here. Like I said, it   s hard to explain, but it was a  great trip, and I hope to get to go out there and visit again because it   s  kind of like going home.  Did you have any ideas that surfaced in your work after that?  What I really felt after being in Cherokee   and I don   t want to sound  ungrateful about the artwork there or unappreciative, but I was so glad  that I had Anna because if they had had her there, it might   ve    They do  have some quality artists, Joel Queen, and there are a lot of some of the  older potters there. Our pottery (and maybe I   m just prejudiced) is a little  bit different than theirs. Now, Joel Queen, he   s more contemporary, but  as far as, like, traditional, the effigies and the bowls and things that are, I  don   t know, theirs is a little bit different. You can tell. They   re from  their area, and we   re from here. We   re not the same, but we do study the  17  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  same shapes and the stamped pottery and that kind of thing. Like I said,  Anna set the standard pretty high for us. (Laughter)  Have you benefitted a little bit from   they finally got that legislation  passed to earmark a certain percentage of the tribe   s     Any time they build         expenditures on new buildings for art.  When they first built the casino out   I guess when they opened up the  hotel, I did get, like, one piece of pottery.  At Catoosa, Hard Rock?  At Catoosa, yes. I think it   s one of those things where you have to apply  or you have to send your   and because I work full-time, I really just  never pursued that. I don   t really have anything in the gift shops. Maybe  one of these days, but right now I don   t.  So, how do you manage that, working full-time and   you just know how  many shows you can actually do?  Yes.  How do you balance that?  Like this year I   ve only done two art shows, but then because the Five  Civilized Tribes and the Cherokee Heritage Museum, they have the Trail  of Tears and then they have the Homecoming show and then the Five  Civilized Tribes has Art under the Oaks, at least I do have an  opportunity to show my work in those. It   s an art-competitive show. You  can still get a little bit of work out there and get your recognition, and so  people still see your work even though there   s not a whole lot of it right  now.  Typically, how many pieces do you try to do on a weekend?  Like when I went to Santa Fe, I took about fifteen pieces, and so I was  more selective with what I made for that because I came home with  three pieces.  Working specifically for that show.  Yes because that is my big art market. Like the Cherokee Art Market,  while it   s a great show and they have lots of ribbon money,  75,000, it   s  18  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  not a good selling market yet. I still want to continue to support it  because that   s the only way that we   re going to get to the level where we  need to be, where the buyers come in and recognize the quality artwork  and people can actually profit from participating in that art show.  Hopefully, one day we   ll be there.  Are commissions a very big part of your work?  I might do only a half a dozen commissions a year. It   s not like I have a  website or I try to advertise it. It   s just if somebody refers me, or like I   ll  come back from Santa Fe with, maybe, three or four commissions. And  that   s fine. That   s all I really have time to do for. Commissions to me are  harder to do than like,    Oh, I saw a piece of driftwood, and now I know  I   m going to make a fish effigy to go on it, and I   m going to mount it.     It   s not as inspiring for someone to say,    Okay, well, I want this kind of  pot.    It   s much more rewarding, I guess, to make what   s in your mind or  on your heart.  So, how do you think   we   re going to talk just a little bit about your  philosophy and your techniques now. How do you think the colors of  your work, pottery, and the forms have maybe changed over the years?  I think, for myself, mine hasn   t really changed a lot from when I started  thirteen years ago with Anna. It   s just because that   s what I enjoy doing.  Every artist wants to grow in their art. Last year I did a contemporary  form out of some commercial earthenware clay. I did a nice big carved  pot. I put a big price on it. It won a big ribbon, and it still wasn   t as  rewarding to me as doing my little turtle effigies. I wanted to know that I  could do that, but that   s not really my style. I may do a few more pieces  like that, but I like my little pieces. (Laughter)  And the majority of your work is still wood-fired, I suppose, too.  Yes, except for this summer. Almost every summer now for the past few  years because of the droughts, we   ve had the burn ban going. This  summer was so incredible dry I couldn   t cheat at all, and it did hurt me  at Santa Fe this year because I couldn   t enter into a traditional category.  That   s where I feel like my strengths are and what I enjoy and what I  want to promote for myself. I had to enter it all in contemporary, even  though it was in my Native clay, hand-formed, everything but wood-firing.  Hopefully, we   re going to get some more rain soon  (Laughter)  Now, you do a lot of incising of designs. Do you draw those? Do you  sketch those out prior to working on them?  Sometimes. Sometimes I   ll have a little book or something and lay out  19  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  the designs that I want. One of the things that Anna taught me is that,     Okay, you build your pot, and you think of what you want.    But  because I   m not a perfectionist, she said,    Don   t worry if part of the  design isn   t quite going to fit like you   re going to duplicate.    She says,     You make the design fit the pot,    and so that   s what I do.  It kind of falls into place somehow, even though it might be a little  bigger over here and a little bit smaller over here because I don   t have  templates. I might have, like, a small template or something, but it   s not  a perfect science to putting the design on the pot. It   s just what she said:     Make the design fit the pot.    And that   s what I do.  How important is burnishing for you, the burnishing part of the process?  I   ve gone to Gilcrease and got to go into their archives and study and  research and photograph, not very many Woodland pieces but a lot of  the Southeastern, what they call the Mississippian time period pieces.  They weren   t highly burnished. I know a lot of the artists now are doing  the real high-glossy burnishing, and I like that, too, but mine mostly are  a little more matty. They   re not that real glassy, shiny because that   s not  my style.  How about your signature? How   d you do that?  Well, because my dad was somewhat of a doodle artist, I guess   and  actually, he had been a silversmith artist in his younger years before he  met and married my mom, and then, of course, he raised his kids. About  five years or six years before he died, he got started back into making his  jewelry again, and he signed his jewelry    Run Free.    I don   t know  where that came from. I was a daddy   s girl, and so when I started  making my pottery, that was the first thing that went on my pottery just  because of my dad. So it   s Run Free. (Laughter)  What is your creative process from the time you get an idea?  I usually have to think on it a while. I   ll get an idea, and sometimes I   ll  even write it down because I might forget about it if I don   t. (Laughs) Or  I   ll put it in my notes on my iPhone or something and mull it over for a  little while, and then I   ll start on it. Then, usually, it   ll come together  pretty good, not always, but sometimes. (Laughter)  Will you see a piece all the way through, or will you be working on  several pieces simultaneously?  With pottery, especially if you   re getting ready for a show, it   s really  better to work on two or three pieces at one time because you   re going to  20  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  have one piece that   s still kind of wet. You can start on another piece  while this one   s setting up a little bit and maybe get another one started  and keep it covered up. It is good, especially if you   re working toward a  show, to get two or three pieces going at one time because with clay, if  you keep it covered up pretty good, you can let it process to the point  where you can do the work that you want to when it dries a little bit  more.  Do you have a place around here where you dig your clay?  I do not have a great source for clay. I   m the person that when we   re  driving down the road and they   re working on the roadbed or something,     Oh my gosh, there   s clay over there     (Laughter) Just because I don   t  have a good source for clay. I do have a pile of clay down in the pasture.  My daughter had friends that worked for Frankoma Pottery, which is  right down the road from us, before they closed. They hauled clay for  them from what they call Sugar Loaf Hill in Sapulpa.  I once mentioned to her friends, I said,    Well, I sure would like to have  some of that clay.    They said,    Well, I   ll bring you some,    so they did.  They brought me a dump truck load full of clay. It   s now in the pasture.  Stuff grows out of it. (Laughter) I can go down and get some. It   s a little  soft, but it makes really pretty pottery. It doesn   t burnish great, but if  you make a nice little slip out of it, you can get a little more shine.  How important are slips with your work?  I usually put a slip, at least a little fine slip maybe of the same clay body,  on everything because, to me, it makes a little smoother pot. To me, the  slip is just the fine particles of clay. Because you are hand forming, you  have some little incongruities in your piece. It kind of fills that in, and  then when you burnish it, it even fills it in a little bit more. I like to use  the slips. I think they   re good.  What is your creative routine?  Only through the workweek. Saturdays and Sundays are for family and  grandkids. Usually come home, fix dinner, do a load of laundry, clean  up the kitchen, and then I go out to my workshop, me and my dogs. My  husband watches the ball games on TV, and that way I have my clay and  can sometimes work too late.  But at least a couple hours.  Yes.  21  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Okay, so what was maybe a fork-in-the-road moment for you when you  could   ve gone one direction with the pottery and you went in another?  My road with my pottery has been pretty straight, again, just because of  Anna Mitchell. She taught me the way I wanted to go, and I believed in  her, and I had faith and confidence in her. It was so much about the  culture and the processes. It   s been pretty much the same from the very  beginning.  What   s been one of the high points of your career? It might   ve been one  that you mentioned.  I   ve done the Santa Fe Indian Art Market, and I   ve had success there.  I   ve been to the Heard  Museum  show and the Eiteljorg  Museum of  American Indians and Western Art  show and our shows here, the Red  Earth. I don   t do as much of those anymore because the job I have right  now is a great job. It   s very demanding, so I   m not doing as many shows  now. Honestly, anytime anyone asks me anything about my pottery, it   s  just because I say I met this wonderful lady. I was already an adult, my  kids were raised, and she really influenced the path I   ve taken for  thirteen years now. I know she   s gone, but she   s always with us.  What   s been one of the low points?  Losing Anna, definitely.  You   ve talked about the dolls that you   re going to collaborate on with  your daughter. Is there another project coming up that you   re super  excited about or a technique that you   ve     Because I have the three granddaughters now, and they   re young,  (they   re one, two, and four) I really want to take them to the art shows,  give them the exposure that I didn   t get. Not cram it down their throat  (no one wants that for their kids or grandkids) but show them the path,  and if that   s what they choose, then I want to teach them what I know  and see what happens from there.  And we   ll get to see the piece that you   ve kept, that your granddaughters  have dibs on, probably, now. (Laughs) Is there anything that we   ve  forgotten to cover that you   d like to add?  I don   t think so. I appreciate the opportunity to be here and to share my  story and hope that it   ll influence someone else maybe to follow the  traditional pottery path. There   s not a whole lot of us. I mentioned that I  do the Creek Cultural Day, and we have hundreds of kids come. It   s  really great exposure for them because I am taking the Native clay, let  22  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  them see what it takes. They grind it and sift it, and then we rehydrate it  and wedge it all together. Then I let them make the pieces out of it.  I tell those kids, I said,    One of these days, one of you might be a potter  or an artist or something, but if you choose this traditional pottery path  and you don   t like hard work, you won   t like this.    It is about hard work,  but it   s very rewarding when you know you can go out and dig your own  clay, do everything from the very beginning, use what Mother Nature  provided for you, and come out with something that can be quite  extraordinary sometimes. Not all of them are going to be like that, but  sometimes you get that piece and you go,    Oh my gosh  That   s what I  should   ve done.    It can be very rewarding.  Great. We   re going to take a look at your work then. Okay, would you  like to tell us about this piece?  This is what I would call a tripod water bottle. The inspiration for this  is   my three granddaughters are ages four, two, and one   but to go  along with the Three Sisters: corn, beans, and squash. When I started on  this, it was going to be a traditional entry for Santa Fe, but I did not get  to wood fire it. I don   t even think I entered it out there this year.  We have the corn for my little green-eyed Kambryn, who   s the four-year-  old. Then we have the beans, and she   s a little one-year-old. That  kind of fits her personality, as well. (Laughter) Then we have the squash,  which is the middle granddaughter that   s two. I looked at their faces.  They all have this little button nose. It is a piece that I   m sure I   ll keep  for the girls.  That   s very nice.  It is a traditional style, just like Anna said, with my own identity put  onto it.  This piece was inspired from a Moundville stone bowl. It does have this  kind of a mythological serpent head on it. The head is pretty much like  what I saw in the photograph, and the boat shape and the duck, but what  I did a little bit more is do some light carving but with Mississippian  designs: the hand and the eye, and the spirals repeated on each side.  Now, in hindsight if I did this again, I   d probably make it a little bit  taller, but it   s too late now. The head   s hollow, and it actually has some  little beads in it, which is typical of some of those Southeastern, more  ceremonial-type piece is what I would call this.  It   s just beautiful. You can see the fact that the burnish is more subtle.  You can see how nicely that works.  23  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  Little Thunder  Hanna  And this one is only wood fired because I   ve done this one since I got  back from Santa Fe. They actually lifted the burn ban in Creek County.  Yes, I saw that. Finally   I   m like,    I   m in Creek County  Oh my gosh, the pottery gods are  smiling on me     (Laughter)  You   re right  There are pottery gods, and they   re smiling  (Laughter) All  right, and this piece?  This piece, because I   ve done so many of the animal effigies, I   ve done a  lot of turtles and fish. Those seem to be my best ones. Frogs. But  actually, I was in a flea market or junk store, and I found an old doily, a  grandmother   s doily. I immediately said,    That   s my next turtle,     because the top part is flat, just rolled out flat with the doily rolled on  top of it. To me, it made the perfect turtle top, and then the rest of it is  coiled. I did elaborate, which I don   t normally do, with a little bit of     Copper        copper foil. It   s a turtle effigy bottle.  Right, I love the little face.  I actually got to wood fire this one, too. I made these for the Cherokee  Art Market.  Well, thank you very much for your time tonight, Crystal.  I   m glad you came, and I know it   s a late night for you when you have to  do this.  -------  -------
