Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Sir, could you please state your name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Bob Black, B-O-B, B-L-A-C-K.
Speaker 1: Now is that your full name?
Speaker 2: Well, no, my, my full name is Robert Steven Black.  I was--that's what I was born with.  I was named after my mother's dad.  His name was Robert.  I don't--and Steven comes from the Bible.  She took it out of the Bible.  And of course, my, my dad's name--surname was Black, so that's, that's what I was born with.  But I grew up with Bobby.  Everybody calls me Bobby.  And even to this very day, if someone comes up behind me, and I don't see 'em, and they yell out "Bobby," it's somebody who knew me before I knew myself.  And so I, I kind of like that.  But in recent years, since I've been a professional photojournalist, I use Bob.  So that's what I use all the time.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you care to try to spell Robert Steven for us?
Speaker 2: Oh, sure, R-O-B-E-R-T, S-T-E-V-E-N.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay, and what, what, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Chicago, June 4th, 1939.  It's an ancient time (laughter).  And I was born in Provident Hospital [of Cook County], right there on 51st Street.  They've torn it down now.
Speaker 1: The black hospital?
Speaker 2: It was black, right, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm a staff photographer at the Chicago Sun-Times.
Speaker 1: All right, and what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is January 17th, 2003.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: Right now, we're in The HistoryMakers' office, at 1900 South Michigan Avenue, on the very high up second floor walk (laughter).
Story_ID: 79336
Speaker 1: Okay, now before we get into depth, there are five "People" magazine-ish-type questions that I am compelled to ask you.  And the first one--they just require a short answer.  The first one is--
Speaker 2: How many girlfriends I've had (laughter)?
Speaker 1: The first one is what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'd say my favorite food would be something very healthy.  I, I, I would, I'd say corn, yeah, corn.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Not, not really, but I'm very partial to blue.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Oh, definitely, it's the summer and the fall (laughter), yeah, early fall.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Well, it used to be, years ago, Mississippi, because it offered tremendous photographic opportunities for me.  Now, it's almost anywhere in the world.  One of my newest favorite places to be now is Paris [France], because it's a great photographic setting.  It just--there's no end to the photographic opportunities.  And it's just--it doesn't--it's not really dramatic things, just things you see on a-- everyday things on the street is just, it's rich.  And so I, I like, I like going there, and I've almost fallen in love with the city.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yeah, "I love you with the love of Jesus."  That means no matter what you do, I'm gonna love you anyway (laughter).
Story_ID: 79337
Speaker 1: Now let's talk about your--what you know about the origins of your family.  You know, how far can you trace your family tree back?  Can you go back to the 19th century, to pre-Civil War, or can you, you know, just how far you can go back that you--
Speaker 2: Well, I, I've--one of these days I'm gonna actually take--make the effort to really study that, but as far as I know, on my mother's [Elaine Curry Black Martin] side, we go back to Macon, Georgia.  And on my dad's [Clarence Black, Jr.] side, we go back to Kentucky and I think somewhere around the Louisville area.  But that's as far as I can, I can go back.  I know my grandmother [Janie Curry] on my mother's side, she's--they were all out of Macon, Georgia.  And I need to go there.  I haven't been to Macon.  I've been everywhere else in Georgia, but I haven't been to Macon, and I need to go there and, and actually begin to try to, to search out exactly how my family tree was formed.  And Kentucky, I'll, I'll have to go there too, but so, that's what I plan to do.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you hear any stories from your, your parents or your grandparents when you were coming up about the family history in, in Macon or Louisville or, you know, any stories about, you know, what people were doing when the slaves were freed or what they were doing, you know, you know, during Reconstruction or, or how they got to Chicago [Illinois] and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, oddly enough, we didn't hear a lot of those kind of stories when I was growing up with my family.  I think most--a lot of my mother's side of the family, a lot of them had pretty much found their way here.  And for reasons that I don't fully understand, they didn't talk about, or it wasn't discussed as to what their experiences were in coming here.  I've, over the years, have realized, you know, pretty much how they and other black people came out of the South during the Great Migration years.  But as far as their particular story in our family, we didn't talk about that much.  And my mother is 83, and I--maybe I'll, I'll have to talk, sit down and talk with her and find out if she's heard some things.  But, but I did know a lot of my aunts, and I was fortunate enough to have a great-grandmother [Ellen Clark] who was, had later became a great-great-grandmother through one of my brothers [Arnold Black].  And so, we had her for, for quite a while, but for some reason we didn't have a, a good sense of history that we should have had so that we could have sat down and found out what, what were some of the experiences they had when they were in the South.  I'd heard bits and pieces, but not enough to really put together.
Story_ID: 79338
Speaker 1: So both, both your mother [Elaine Curry Black Martin] and your father [Clarence Black, Jr.] were in Chicago when they met?
Speaker 2: Right, yes, they were.
Speaker 1: Now did they have a story about how they met?
Speaker 2: Well, they grew up together in, pretty much in the same neighborhood.  They went to the same church.  That's pretty, that's where they met.  They, they met at the Berean Baptist Church [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Can you spell that?
Speaker 2: Sure, B-E-R-E-A-N.  It takes its name from the, the town of Berea, who was among some of the first Christians and considered to be very faithful to the faith.  And so that's where the name of the church comes from.  I know that (laughter).  But that's where they met and, and it was--they had a very strong program for young people.  They had a dramatic organization, and they just had all kinds of activities.  And so, that's, that was their, their meeting point, and I think they went to school together too.
Speaker 1: Okay, now could you--let, let's try to talk about, you know, your parents and, and see what we can find out.  Can, can you give us the--your, your father's full name and birthday?
Speaker 2: Sure, Clarence Henry Black.  I don't know the exact day of his birthday.  I can't remember it anyway right now.  And my mother's is Elaine Curry Black Martin.  She remarried later on [to Herbert Martin], yeah.
Story_ID: 79339
Speaker 1: Now approximately when was your father [Clarence Black, Jr.] born?
Speaker 2: Oh, he would have to have been--I don't know exactly when, but he would have to have been just about the same age as my mother [Elaine Curry Black Martin] if he had lived, which would be about 83, 84, somewhere in there.  I think he was a year older, so he would be 84.
Speaker 1: So then he was born around 1918--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, 1919, somewhere around in there, 'cause I do, I do recall this much, that my mother's dad [Robert Curry] was in World War I.  And she was a youngster at the time that he had gone off to World War I.
Speaker 1: Okay, that, that's important to, you know--
Speaker 2: And my dad served in World War II in the Pacific Theater.  And he, his tour of duty was in the Philippines.  I remember that quite well.  I remember him coming home after the war.
Speaker 1: Now can you tell us something--and I'm gonna ask about your mother separately, but tell, tell us about your father.  What, what kind of person was he?  What was he interested in?  What did he do for a living?
Speaker 2: Well, he was a postal worker.  When he finally settled into a regular job, he was a postal worker.  He worked at the post office downtown, and he worked in various departments over the period of time that he was there.  And he was a, a very industrious person, and he worked every day.  As all I can--I, I remember quite vividly leaving for work and coming home from work.  I could see him coming across the backyard.  And he liked to have fun; he was a fun-loving person.  He loved the blues, you know.  He, he--and I remember a lot of times, especially on the weekends, he loved to listen to Al Benson on the radio, and that was, that was one of his favorite pleasures, listening to Al Benson and, and having a glass of Pabst Blue Ribbon.  So he was, he, he was--that--he just liked--he was a very fun-loving person, and, and he pretty strict disciplinarian.  He didn't--I know when we--in those days, after the streetlights came on, you had to come in.  If you, you--even if you're just sitting on the steps, you had to come in.  And I can recall him coming in--coming out when I was sitting on the steps and the streetlights come on, he'd come out and said--we had--it was three of us at the time.  And I had a brother named Arnold, and another brother named Clarence, and later on we had David came along.  He'd out come out, and we'd all be sitting out there, and he say: "What's that light mean, Bobby, Arnold, Clarence?"  "It means we gotta come in, daddy."  "All right, come on in here," you know.  So (laughter), yeah, so, we, we--and even after he and my mother divorced in our later years, and especially our teenage years, we always sought him out, and so we had a great relationship with him, you know, which was--I was glad we did, because when he passed away, we were all there. Right with him.
Speaker 1: All right, now, now did he, he, he go to school in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, he did.  He went to, he went to Englewood High School, as a matter of fact.  I think he and my mom both went there.  And I heard he was a, a very bright student.  He was college material, but he just didn't go to college.  There's a lot of, a lot of black folk didn't go to college at, during that time.  But he was, I understand, very good at math.  I wish he'd passed it on to me.  That was always my weakest point.  But, yeah, he was--he had leadership skills.  When he was in the military, I think he--I'm not sure, but I think he attained the rank of sergeant, you know, while in the military.  So he had--he was, he was a leadership type of person.  So I, I remember that quite well.  I remember one time while he had one job at the post office where he had to carry a weapon.  And I (laughter), I can remember that he used to talk about how he had to--he was on the docks, and he had to guard this mail, and, and nobody was gon' get through.  You know, they weren't gon' take the mail from him.  So he was, he was a pretty determined type of person.
Story_ID: 79340
Speaker 1: Now tell us about your mother [Elaine Curry Black Martin].  Now she was born around the same time as your father [Clarence Black, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think a year later, about the same--it was around the same time.
Speaker 1: In 1919.
Speaker 2: Right, un-huh, right, exactly.  And well, my mother, she grew up in the church, and, and that was what she had always been accustomed to all of her life.  And, and so when we were coming along, she brought us into the church; she introduced us right almost from birth into the church, and so we all kind of grew up that way.  And my mother was, I wouldn't say religious, I think she was more spiritual, although you didn't know that at the time.  That's something you think about as you look back over the years, what, what it really was.  And--but she, she was very active in the church.  She belonged to several auxiliaries, and she was almost like a pillar of the church, as a matter of fact.  People would--she was always the go-to person whenever something had to be done, or if somebody was reluctant to go to the pastor on something, they'd get her: "Elaine, you go and talk to 'em," you know.  And so our church was kind of historic in a way, because the pastor, the founding pastor, Reverend William Braden, was a chaplain during World War I.  As a matter of fact, there's this book written about him, where he served as chaplain during that time.  And the book is called "Braden's Boys" or something like that.  And I just realized when I saw--read that book, or saw it, that, at that time, during World War I, the Americans--black soldiers did not fight under the American flag.  They fought under the French flag, you know, and he was chaplain to all those.  So he, he became kind of a legend in his own right.  So our church itself was a very active place for young people, and she, she grew there, and, and we all grew up there.  We, we, we served in many of the same organ--the choir.  My mother was a prolific singer.  She could handle very complex musical pieces such as the "Messiah," [by George Frideric Handel] as well as very soulful and spiritual songs as gospel.  She was very--and as a result, because of her love of the musical right, her musical range, I have developed a very strong musical taste that goes from blues to gospel to jazz to classical, you know, 'cause it's all good music, as Wynton Marsalis says (laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you sing of playing an instrument or anything?
Speaker 2: No, but when I was very active in, in the church I sang in the choir, and then even in school I sang in, in choirs.  And when I used to--even like her, I would sing in different choirs when they were performing the "Messiah" or, or things like that, or I was in a gospel group.  And so I've, I've done all I've, I have done that in the past.  And I do--right now I'm just an appreciator of good music.  So, even as I drive down the street, I can go, depending on what I'm feeling, I can plug in the gospel music station or the classical musical station, and, and then late at night sometimes the, the jazz.  So, but it's--'cause it's all good music.
Story_ID: 79341
Speaker 1: Now, can you reflect back on the part of town that you grew up?  Now what part of town did you grow up in?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I, I grew up on the South Side, the mid-South Side of Chicago [Illinois], and more precisely, the 5700 block of South Wabash [Washington Park].  And it was a great time to be alive, a great time to be a kid.  You know, you could go outside, you could play, you could run up and down the block.  Everybody knew each other.  The neighbors knew you.  You didn't get too far out of line, 'cause the neighbors would tell on you, and your, your parents would get you, again, you know.  And it wasn't this--they would--and everybody was watching out for one another.  And so it, it, it was just, it was a, it was a great time.  Oh yeah, we, we always had some problems with some kids, but for the most part, I wouldn't--I'm glad that I, I grew up during that time.  It was like, it was in the, the '40's [1940s], '50's [1950s], '60's [19760s], and primarily in my childhood, it was mostly the late '40's [1940s] and all of the '50's [1950s] that I was growing up.  And in the 57 [1957], we lived right across the street from the [William W.] Carter Elementary School.  And at that time, there were a lot of--we didn't know they were famous.  We just heard about them what we--you know, there was (laughter) a very renowned police officer named "Two-Gun Pete" [Sylvester Washington], and he lived on one end of the block.  And down in the middle of our block, relatives of Joe Louis's wife [Marva Trotter] lived.  And so it was, it--you know, and we had poor people, and we had police officers, and we had schoolteachers; we, we just had the whole gamut.  There was a time when no matter what you--how much money you made or what status you achieved, you all lived together, the same neighborhood.  And believe it or not, they're trying to get back to that.  Neighborhoods were stable, you know, didn't have any problems.  And it's so un-un-unfortunate that integration brought about the destabilization over a period of time, because everybody--the people who could leave, they left, and those who couldn't, stayed.  And that's when the destabilization came in.  So they're trying to recreate that again, and it's gon' take awhile, but I'm sure that it'll, it'll happen.  But no, it was a great time; I loved every minute of it.
Story_ID: 79342
Speaker 1: Now what were some of the sights, and sounds, and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: We had two smells that, that you could--that I remember very vividly.  One was the stockyard, 'cause stockyards were still open and operating at the time.  And if the wind blew a certain way, it'd come right across our neighborhood (laughter) and you knew what that was.  And, and then there was the bakery [Schulze Baking Company Plant] down at, on Garfield Boulevard, and so you get a nice smell of the bread baking, coming, coming our way from time to time as well.
Speaker 1: That's--they still do that over there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it's still in operation, still in operation.  And some of the other sounds are kids playing ball on the empty vacant lots on one end of the block or the other end, a lot of times right across the street in the schoolyard.  I'd like to think that in the [William W.] Carter [Elementary] schoolyard on the Wabash side there's a sign that say "no ball playing allowed."  And I think my playmates and I were responsible for that, because we broke a few windows after a while.  And so they put up the sign, and that's the reason it's up there.  I guess I can kind of be proud of that, I suppose (laughter).  But it was a great time, and you could hear kids calling up and down the street.  As a matter of fact, the big news commentator with CNN lived in there, [Bernard] Bernie Shaw, lived--
Speaker 1: Bernie Shaw--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, he, he lived in the same neighborhood.  We went to Carter School.  He was a contemporary of my brother, Arnold, but we all knew each other.  And they had--we all had nicknames.  And they called my brother, Arnold, "onion head" (laughter).  And so we had a lot of interesting people who came through the neighborhood at, at that time.  It was, you know, and, and every once in a while--there was a firehouse not too far away on 54th in Wabash, and you'd always see them coming up and down the street.  Whenever there was a bad accident, everybody would come out to see what was going on.  People in the neighborhood were very friendly.  And even if there were disputes, everybody got over it.  You know, you didn't have the hostilities that you have now, today.  It was a great time.  The stuff that you see on some of these television sitcoms about that era is pretty close to being correct.  And it's not that it wasn't problems politically.  There were--there was tremendous problems.  Socially, you know, there were a lot of things that--but we tend to--that we were able to kind of get through it, yeah.
Story_ID: 79343
Speaker 1: Well, what kind of a little boy were you?  What, what, what did, what did you like to do, and you know, you were outgoing, or were you shy, or what--
Speaker 2: Well, no, I wasn't shy.  Everybody pretty much knew where I was coming from.  I was very outgoing, and I just liked being with people.  I just liked interacting with people.  I was, I've always been that way, and I was pretty well-liked throughout the neighborhood, and got along pretty much with everybody.  There was always some people that you didn't always make.  But some of the things I liked to do when I was, when I was a kid--well, we had a, we had a bicycle, so I loved bike riding, roller skating.  And also, I also picked up a knack for being able to draw, so I liked artwork.  At one time I thought I wanted to be a doctor, and I loved science and, and the things that you could discover through the scientific process.  So it was--I had a hard time learning how to swim, though.  So it was a combination of two things that helped me learn to swim.  We were in Boy Scouting, and my mother [Elaine Curry Black Martin] put us all in Boy Scouting because she wanted us to develop, you know, a sense of independence and being able to take care of ourselves.  She felt that was a good way to learn that, and so he put us in Scouting.  And I got to be a leader in the Boy Scouts, and so it was, that was a great experience for me.  Because there are things that I learned there that I'll take with me to the grave, just simple things, if it's nothing more than knowing how to tie the right knot to secure things together.  I learned that in Scouting, basic first aid, you know.  I learned all that in Scouting.  And, and it was, it was a great experience, to be able to have that experience, and go to summer camps.  And so I believe--it was--I learned to swim at summer camp and Scouts, and also [William W.] Carter Elementary School had a swimming pool, one of the only elementary schools in the city that had one.  The reason for that, it was once an experimental school at one time.  And they would try out new things, so they put a swimming pool in there.  It just so happened, it was, it was still there when I was going.  So between those two, I learned to swim.  And we, and we--everything was in the neighborhood, everything.  I went to--I worked my, one of my first jobs was at a supermarket at 57th and State, you know, where I was a stock boy.  And, and then, also, at the drugstore across the street, I used to work there, used to deliver prescriptions to the people in the neighborhood and all sorts of other packages.  And so it was, it was--that's where I learned--had my first work experiences, right there in the neighborhood.  So it was, it was a great time.
Story_ID: 79344
Speaker 1: What--how did you like school [William W. Carter Elementary School]?  I mean, what was your experience in school?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I liked school.  I, I, I, I never had a bad experience.  I've always had some teachers I didn't like, but other than that I liked school.  I didn't have any problems.  It was right across the street from where I lived, so it was a, it was a straight show.  And I was on the school safety patrol, so I was involved in, at, at, at school.  In my corner that I--I was known as a (laughter) pretty tough patrol boy.  I didn't let anybody get out of into the street, unless I told 'em to, and--
Speaker 1: Did you get the belt and a badge and all that--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I had the whole, whole works.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, as a matter of fact, you know, the safety patrol, they did--they had two field trips each year: to the circus and to the ballgame.  So that was (laughter), that was all worth the effort to be there.  So yeah, I, I was pretty tough. I, I, I, I really ran my corner kind of tight.
Speaker 1: That's something that they don't do in school anymore.  I haven't seen any safety patrollers in a long time.
Speaker 2: It's very few.  I, I see them every once in a while, but you don't, you really don't see that much of that.
Speaker 1: It was a big deal in those days--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh yes, was, it, it was.  That was a big deal, because that was really how they helped the children to get across the street safely.  Yeah, it, it was, it was a very big deal.  It, it was throughout the whole school system.  'Cause they, they couldn't put a policeman on every corner, so the school safety patrol was the way it was done, and it worked very well, worked very well.  As a matter of fact, I turned in my best friend for crossing in the middle of the street.  We used to go around to the rooms if we saw people crossing in the middle of the street, and we'd point him out (laughter).  And she and I were very good friends, but I had to turn her in.  She, she broke the law (laughter).  Aubra [ph.] Fox, she'll never--she, she didn't forgive me for that (laughter), but she didn't cross in the middle of the street anymore either (laughter).  But it was a great time.  I, I had--and I learned a lot of leaderskip--leadership--techniques by being part of the school safety patrol, being in Scouting [Boy Scouts of America], and then later, when I went into the military, I had had those basic skills that I could take with me there as well.
Speaker 1: Now did you go to Scout camp?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes, it was the Owasippe Scout Camps [Owasippe Scout Reservation] up in [Twin Lake] Michigan.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, don't ask me how to spell it.  I can't remember now.
Speaker 1: Owasippe.
Speaker 2: O--yeah, O-W--they're still in existence, so you can call the Chicago Council of the Chicago Boy Scouts and get it.  They're still, they're still up there in Michigan.  And so I, I went every year, and I got to be a leader at one of the camps.  I became--and I applied for and became a staff member at one of the camps.  It was Camp Blackhawk, as a matter of fact, and I was the naturalist.  I was the one who took the kids out on the nature trails and showed them the poison ivy, and we handled the snakes, we, we--kids, and, and the kids would go out and they'd capture--they, they got rattlesnakes up there in Michigan.  They'd find these rattlesnakes and bring 'em in, and we'd put 'em in the cages and, and whatnot.  So, yeah, and I would teach 'em how to handle snakes and what, and everything.
Story_ID: 79345
Speaker 1: Yeah, and so I, I would take the kids [Boy Scouts] out on their nature trails [at Camp Blackhawk], and I'd show them the poison ivy, and I'd, I'd show them how brave I was.  I'd reach down and pick up, pull it together, pick it up and say now this is poison ivy.  They didn't know, and I would tell them, though, that you can do that.  It's the, it's the, the inside of the plant, if it gets on you, that's what causes the rash.  But if you can just break the plant off and not get any of the inside portion of the plant, you're fine.  But usually when people get into poison ivy they're breaking the plants, and of course, that, that moisture from the plant gets on their skin and causes the rash.  So I would show them what the difference was and--
Speaker 2: You really were the nature--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --how to look for the--
Speaker 2: --You knew all the tricks--
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughter), right.
Speaker 2: --all the inside information.
Speaker 1: Right, and it was, it was, it was--the training for that position or any of those staff positions, though, were, was intense.  You had to have water safety; you, you had to go--how to conduct yourself in the wilderness, and it was--you had to, you to know how to canoe.  Canoeing was a big deal in the Scout camps, you know, because that's what they did; they did a lot of canoeing.  So you had to know how to do that; you had to learn how to portage a canoe, carry it across land, and that's, you know, that was--so the, the training for that job was a, was highly intense and--but it was good, and I was glad that I had that experience.  There's a kind of an honor society in the Scouting known as the Order of the Arrow, sort of like a separate group, but it's part of the Scouting [Boy Scouts of America], and you had to be elected into it.  And so I was elected into it at one of the camp--it's a big ceremony.  It's based on an Indian legend and everything.  And it's supposed to signify the high ideals of scouting.  And, and you wear a, a white sash with a red arrow that kind of sets you apart from everybody else.  People think you're somebody, you know.  And there are three degrees.  And it start as Ordeal, and you'd have to--you know, you're out in the woods, you know, all night long and by yourself.  And, and then there's a Brotherhood, and the there--each one of them has their own signi--insignia.  And then, of course, the big one is the Vigil Honor, and I, I never got the Vigil Honor.  I have a very good friend of mine, Norville (ph.) Carter, who has always been after me to reactivate in, in terms of being a leader and, and some Scout troop, and he'd see to it I get my Vigil Honor (laughter).  But, so it was--yeah, I was, I was, I was very active in all that.  I was active all the way through my young adult years in Scouting in some form or another.  And I think, for any young boy and any young man, that's, that's, that, that'd be a good experience for him, 'cause I, I did, I learned a lot, how to take care of myself.  So, when I did get into the military, I knew about simple things, like washing dishes when you're out there in the wilderness, how important that was (laughter).  'Cause if you didn't do that right, you could be very sick (laughter).  So it was--and, and just knowing how to take care of yourself if, if you got hurt or some friends of your got hurt.  And a lot of those principles are still the same.  They don't change, and they will save your life, they really will.  I think one of the principles of first aid: stop the bleeding, protect the wound, and prevent shock.  That's, those are the three basic principles, and it works no matter what, you know.  And so it was, it was a great learning experience that my mother [Elaine Curry Black Martin] put us through.  And, and as I look back on it in retrospect, I'm kind of glad she did.
Speaker 2: Okay, were all your brothers involved in the Scouts?
Speaker 1: Yes, they were, all of them were as a matter of fact, and in various degrees.  My youngest brother, David, he, he became a ranger at one of the camps, as a matter of fact.  And, and so he was--they were very involved in that.  They were also involved in, in the drum and bugle corps of the American Legion.  And one of my brothers was a drum corps--drum major, and another one was, he was, he was in the color guard before the George L. Giles drum corps, and which was a highly decorated drum corps at the time.
Speaker 2: Did, did it run out of the Army over there?
Speaker 1: No, it ran out of the, the, the American Legion Post at 57th and State Street.  And we lived right behind--my backyard was right behind them, and we could hear the drum corps all the time rehearsing.  So two of my brothers got very active in it and--but, as a result of being in the Scouting, they, they understood all the principles of that.  So we were all involved at some point or another.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what, what teachers or people in the community took a particular interest in you and--that, that, that you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, we had two teachers in our--that we grew up with in our community.  One was a very good friend of my mom's [Elaine Curry Black Martin], who, they, they grew up together, Emma Stacker, who later became, I think she became a principal much later, but she was a schoolteacher, and, and a lady name Mrs. Trotter, who taught at the [William W.] Carter [Elementary] School.  She would come home every--we'd see her all--every day at lunchtime.  She'd go home.  But they were very instrumental in giving us that little extra push that we needed to have.  And, as a matter of fact, Mrs. Stacker used to give us the IQ test that they would give in the schools.  We'd go up to her house, and we'd take the IQ test and everything.  And so that, it was, it was very helpful.  They were very supportive.  And, and without them, I think we would have--eh, we probably would have made it, but they made it easier for us to be able to make it through, through school.  So they were very important people in our lives, plus Mrs. Stacker was, was a member of our church, the Berean [Baptist] Church.  So, we were all--it was a very tight-knit community, and everybody looked out for each other and each other's children.  And, and we all really was--it was, it was pretty good.  So the teachers in school were very supportive.  You always--and even with teachers that we thought were mean, you know, they, they had a reason for being mean.  They wanted us to be able to tow the line, that, that, that they wanted us to know that life was not gonna be easy on us, so they were getting us ready to deal with life.  We didn't know it at the time, but in their own special way, they were, they were shaping us and forming us to be prepared so that when we got out into the world and ran across people who were really mean, we'd be able to deal with that.  So they, they had their own special way, and, and they were very--the teachers were very supportive when we were coming through school.  We didn't know that the school system wasn't always working in our best interest in the black community, because we had good teachers at the time who were doing very well by the students.  And so, we didn't find that out until a few, maybe a decade later that the school system was--'cause then it began to really show up, the--how bad it was.  But during the time I was in school, it, it wasn't.  It didn't--the teachers were good enough that we did well in school, so as a result, we didn't know that they just wasn't always working in our best interest.

Speaker 1: Tell me about high school.  What about Englewood [High School]?
Speaker 2: Oh, Englewood, that was a great time.  I en--that was where I began to get myself acclimated toward a career in photojournalism.  That was when I had my first serious camera, which I saved up a lot of my lunch money for so I could buy it.  But we had a lot of good people in high school.  Oh, you have cliques.  That, that, that's always been the case.  And I always seem--I don't know why--I always seemed to have gotten along with everybody in all the cliques.  I didn't--I wasn't always involved at all, in all the cliques, but I always had this--I don't know what it was--this ability to be able to communicate, even if certain cliques were doing things that I didn't particularly care for.  I always had a way of being able to get along with, with the folk, even the guys who--it was a, and it was a small handful of them who used to hang around and drink wine.  And they would (laughter), and then they'd go to class, but they were, they were collecting monies together and then say, okay, let's get our money together so we can get--and it was always, it was just this cheap wine.  And so they'd see me passing buy, and they'd come over and say "Hey, Black, you wanna give us some-" and, and one of the other guys in the group said "Oh no, don't ask him.  He don't, he don't, he don't do that," you know, and so (laughter), but--and one of my best friends succumbed to drug addiction.  And going from that and later to drugs, and it really hurt me 'cause he and I were very close.  I used to try to talk to him, but usually--and I didn't understand fully what drugs could really do to you, and how it can just rob you of your will.  And, and, and that was what had happened.  So matter how much you tried to talk to him, his--he didn't have the will, 'cause the drugs had robbed him of that.  So that, that hurt.  But that didn't happen often.  That--those were very--that was a very small group of people, but for the most part, people did pretty well.  And high school was a great time.  I was a part of the, the school choir.  I was, I was in the ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps].  There was an option between, you know, going and taking gym and ROTC, so I took ROTC.  And I got to be the top sergeants in the company, and so it was, it was, it was, it was a great time for me.  And I never will forget (laughter)--and there were some interesting times too.  You know, with my last name being Black, and that was always a sensitive thing back in those days, and so they used to tell me, too, that you know, when you go to high school they gon' call out your last name first.  And everybody would just make a big deal of it.  I didn't--didn't bother me.  And--but it happened one time, and it was in high school.  It was in ROTC class as a matter of fact, and the, the instructor had started the roll call.  And since I'm at--close to the top, he wasn't gonna break the rhythm, you know, when he got to me.  So he was calling everybody's last name first, you know, so and so, so and so.  And he gets to me, and he goes right through, "Black Robert," and everybody just laid out.  They just--and even he--and he was white--and he looked up; his face was all red, and he was chuckling (laughter), you know.  It was--I even laughed, 'cause it was funny, and 'cause--that he just kept right on going, just right through the rhythm.  But, you know, it was, it was a--you know, everybody, we had a big laugh about that, but that never bothered me.
Speaker 1: Those are the day when people would fight if you called them black.
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, that's right, that's right, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--fighting--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, "Don't call me black!"  Yeah, that's right (laughter).
Speaker 1: Interesting--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: And I, 'cause I remember that myself.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, sure.  But that didn't, that didn't, that didn't bother me.  It didn't bother me at all.  You know, I, I had--I got as much fun out of it as, as the rest (laughter) of 'em did.  But it--even to this very day, my high school girlfriend, we still are in touch with each other, you know, through the years.  And so, you know, we--she lives in California now.  And so we--you know, she, she became a journalist at one time, and, and so we used to meet up every year at the National Association of Black Journalists Convention.  And so, and, and I run into other classmates, former classmates, that we had very good friendships with.

Speaker 1: There was a young man, [HM] George Carruthers, very bright, and he used to go around designing rocket engines and the fuel for rocket engines.  I mean he was, he was a bright young man.  As a matter of fact, he ended up working for NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration], and designed one of the vehicles that they put on the moon.  So--
Speaker 2: What's his name again?
Speaker 1: George Carruthers.
Speaker 2: George Carruthers.
Speaker 1: Right, and I don't know where he's at.  I don't know if he's still with NASA, but he was quite a young man.  And, and you know, he was, he was kind of eccentric.  And, and, and a lot of the kids who, who considered themselves hip and everything, they didn't necessarily--they always looked at poor George as kind of a strange guy, but George and I, we, we got along.  He thought I was as bright as he was, you know, but I wasn't.  But he and I always communicated.  I was, by that time, I was deep into photography, and he saw it from a scientific point of view.  And so he and I always had something to talk about, and so it was, it was--I loved it.  That's where I began my photographic career.
Story_ID: 79349
Speaker 1: Now, now, how did you get involved in photography.  You said at one point that you were a, a decent artist.  You, you--
Speaker 2: Well, I could draw a little bit, yeah.  But by the time I got to high school [Englewood High School] I was dabbling with photography.  I was kind of fooling around with it.  And I used to--at my church that I grew up in, Berean Baptist Church, was really my first introduction to it, because they had a camera club among the adults.  And the, these were people who had a few bucks, so they always had the best of cameras and everything.  And they even had a special project where they would document the history of the church with a movie camera.  And they would show these movies every year at the anniversary of the church.  And they would-edit and everything, and they'd show the movies, and it was--and they would do this throughout the years, and you--people could see themselves when they were youngsters and whatnot.  And--but they had a very active camera club, and they had a lot of the expensive cameras.  And that's where I had my first introduction to it, you know, cameras like Leicas, and Rolleiflex, and the 4x5 Speed Graphic.  These people had all that stuff.  In those times that was expensive stuff.  And, and when they saw that I was pretty interested, they kind of took me under their wings.  And there was a man by the name of Mr. Isles [ph.].  I remember him taking me into his darkroom one day.  I mean (laughter) it was the most elaborate place I ever seen in my life.  And as I'm walking, he says "Oh, don't think you have to do this.  You don't, you don't have to get (unclear)", but see, right in my mind, I wanted to do that.  I wanted to get a darkroom like that.  He said "Ah, no, no, it'll take you a little while; don't worry about it."  But he was the one who introduced me to all that Billy Lites, same--he had a, a twin-lens reflex [TLR].  He--my first--I saw my first print come up in his darkroom, and I was just, I was just blown away.  And then there was--
Speaker 1: How old were you?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was, I was a young teen.  I had to be fifteen, somewhere around in there, yeah, yeah.  And, and then there was Reverend William Vance, who became the pastor of the church eventually, he gave over to me his--he had a little darkroom in the basement of his home, and he just let me have it to use.  He didn't charge me anything, you know, nothing.  And, and I had a key to the basement, and I, I was in there night and day.  I would walk from my house to his house, and I do all my darkroom work in there.  And so, if it wasn't for people like that, I don't think I'd be doing what I do today.  There was another guy named Bobby Orr, who--they were all members of the church, Berean Baptist Church--I learned a lot of things about the physics and the chemistry of photography from him.  And if I ran across a problem I didn't understand, I'd pick up the phone and call him, and he had an answer.  He was good; I mean he knew the physics and the chemistry of photography.  And so--and then, and then, of course, my mother's friends would take a chance on me and let me do their events from time to time.  So they, you know, they, they would say well, you think Bobby can do it?  And of course they didn't wanna pay a lot of money to (laughter)--someone else, so they let me (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--what did you start off (unclear)?
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  There are three proper names in there you might wanna get a spelling for.
Speaker 1: I know, Rolleiflex, Leica?
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  Well, it was also the names of the guy with the darkroom Isle, Orr--
Speaker 1: Oh, Isles.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  --Vance and--
Speaker 1: Vance.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  --and the third one, you just mentioned.
Speaker 1: Oh, Bobby Orr?
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay, and Billy Lites, yeah, yeah.  Isles had an interesting spelling.  I can't remember it, but I'll find out for you.  I'll get it.  Reverend William Vance is, W-I-L-L-I-A-M, V-A-N-C-E; Billy Lites was, well, common spelling on Billy, B-I-L-L-Y, and L-I-T-E-S; and Bobby Orr, common spelling there, B-O-B-B-Y, O-R-R.  And, and I think that was it.
Story_ID: 79350
Speaker 1: But, E. A Isles, that--he was the, he was on the trustee board and, and he--and I never will forget he was a big Leica guy, and he loved Leicas, and he used to talk about how sharp the lenses were.  As a matter of fact, he let me use one of his Leicas when I was--by this time I was pretty much into my work, and I was working at the Chicago Defender.  And I was getting ready to do an all-night thing at the emergency room at Provident Hospital [of Cook County].  And I needed something very quiet.  'Cause that's one of the attributes of the Leica cameras, it's very quiet, it's unassuming, and I needed something like that.  So I called him and asked him if I could use it, said "Sure, come over and get it."  So, with that kind of support--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's something--that, that, that is like, quite a bit of support.  A Leica is an expensive--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yes, it is.
Speaker 2: And to let a teenager use it, is a--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yes, it is.
Speaker 2: Like when you drive a--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --car (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Right.  And then Bobby Orr, he would--he had every kind of camera you could think of.  I could call him up.  He'd let me use his Rolleiflex, you know.  My mother [Elaine Curry Black Martin] used to be nervous about it, and she would call these guys and say why are you lettin' use these expensive cameras for?  They said we know he understands what it's all about, and we wanna try to help him do whatever--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--support--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Those, these are the members of Berea--
Speaker 1: Berean, right.
Speaker 2: --Baptist Church?
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that was my first experience--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --in serious photography.
Speaker 2: Now, did they preserve any of their photos.  Did they shoot good photos and--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, they did--
Speaker 2: --are they still around?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, I don't know if they are or not.  It's hard to say, 'cause that's been a long time.  I know Mr. Isles, of course, is gone on.  Almost everybody has, except Reverend [William] Vance.  You know, he's, he's still, he's still with us, but everybody else is gone, passed on.  But, if it wasn't for people like that, I would--it would have been more difficult, 'cause I wouldn't have had that kind of support to be able to learn about all these things.  And so, I, I'll never forget 'em.  And as a result, what I try to do, I spend time with other, with young, young people who--even if somebody stops me on the street and asks me a question, I can be in a hurry, but I'm gonna stop and I'm gonna explain it to 'em and then get on, you know, to where I got to go.  'Cause if I know, if get a sense that they're interested, I'm gonna give them the time they need.  And I may not ever see them again, but if I can give them a little push, you know, I'm more than willing to do that.
Story_ID: 79351
Speaker 1: Now what was the first camera you bought?  I think I asked you that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, the very first camera I bought was a twin-lens reflex [TLR], and it wasn't a Rolleiflex.  It was called a Ciro-Flex, but it was an American version of the German Rolleiflex, the, the poor man's version.  It was a good camera, and it had a great lens on it and everything.  And so that was my very first one, and I saved up a little more for it.  But then when I got really serious, I had, I had to get the real thing.  So, eventually I got a Rolleiflex, which was--this is what it looked like.  This was the camera to have if you were gonna be a serious photographer at the time I started into photography.  And it was sturdy, it was strong, it, it held up under rugged use, and, and most of the pros had downsized to that from the old 4x5 Speed Graphic.  And so, if you didn't have one of these or something close to it, you just wasn't considered to be serious, you know.  And, and, and this was my first professional camera; of course, this isn't it, but this was the one--it was like this, and, and it was--I used it through almost everything.  Two of my mentors later also became--they were photographers, staff photographers, at the Chicago Defender, Cleo Lyles and [Herman Santonio] "Tony" Rhoden.  And I used to watch those guys, and they used these cameras a lot.  And I used to watch how they would light things.  And in those days, sometimes they took some time and they would light up a situation.  And I watched how they worked in tandem with each other.  So I, I, I learned a lot just watching people like that.  And so, yeah, so this was my first professional camera, and, and they're still sturdy.  I bought this later on someplace else, and I use it every once in a while when I wanna have a larger negative to, to work with from time to time.  But Richard Avedon used one of these cameras for his early work.  I mean this is what he used till just recently, when he decided to work a little slower, a little more painstakingly, by shooting 4x5.  But this was, this was one of--and of course he used Hasselblad as well, but this is one of his cameras, yeah.  But--and then later--well, the very first camera that everybody used, if you was--if it was considered to be anything at all, in the early days, this is not 4x5 in size.  This is three and a quarter.  This is the little brother to the 4x5 Speed Graphic.  Those who couldn't get the, the 4x5, they got something a little bit smaller.  And I picked this up at a camera store that was closing, and this was sitting up on the top shelf.  So I got it, you know, and I--it's usable.  I just don't use it for anything.  But I remember the, the old press photographers, when they would roll up on a scene and the police guy was there for traffic control, they looked over and saw this sitting on the seat next to him.  That, that was his ticket in too.  So and, and then if you wouldn't have one of these, you just wasn't considered to be anybody.
Story_ID: 79352
Speaker 1: But when I came to photography, this [the 4x5 Speed Graphic] was still being used.  This particular format was still being used, and I did use it when I was with the Illinois National Guard as a photographer.  This was, this was the format we used, and so--
Speaker 2: About how long ago was that?
Speaker 1: Oh, this was back in the early '60's [1960s] that I was with the Illinois National Guard.  I had started out being an infantryman in the old 8th Regiment over there on 51st and Cottage Grove [Chicago, Illinois].  And after my first--you had to go and do six months of basic training, 'cause this was at the beginning of the Vietnam War.  It was in its infancy.  That's when they were sending advisors over (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes, "advisors."  That's when they were doing that and--but they were also--the draft was still in, in, in progress at that time, and I had just gotten married for the first time.  And I had not reported to the draft board what my new address was, so they were very earnestly trying to find me (laughter).  And it really got earnest.  They really were, they were really after me, so I found myself joining a National Guard unit.  It was the one on, on Cottage Grove, and I got in there just in the nick of time.  And so that, that took them, took the draft people off my neck.  And I had to go away for six months of active duty training, just like all of the regular Army guys did.  So I did that whole thing.  And then when I got back, that's when the Illinois, the State of Illinois decided to integrate the Illinois National Guard, because their, their all almost--what--all of them were--with the exception of the one I was in, there were no black military people in any of the other units anywhere in the state.  As a matter of fact, there was a unit that they sent me to over on the West Side, on Madison, an armory on Madison, just west of Western.  It was an all-white unit.  It was, it was a Signal Corps battalion.  Well, I knew that's where the photography was in the Army.  It was attached to the Signal Corps, 'cause it's a form of communications.  And immediately, once I got in they were trying to be very accommodating, very nice, and make us feel comfortable.  And they had me assigned as a, some sort of radio operator.  I said I don't wanna do that.  So they would come by, come around and ask what did you-how do you like the unit?  What are you- you know, do you feel all right--say "Oh yeah, I feel fine, but I would feel even better if I got to do what I wanted to do in here."  They say, "Oh, what's that?"  I say "Well, I'm a photographer, and I'd love to be in the photo unit."  "Oh, well, we'll have to see how we can work that out."  So that went on for almost six months, until we were ready to go to our two week of--in summer encampment.  And I was between each--the first and the second week there's a big military parade.  The governor comes up.  At that time it was [Otto] Kerner [Jr.], he was governor.  He'd come up and the troops go on parade and show off and everything.  And oddly enough, I was sitting in the Signal Corps--we didn't march like the infantry guys did.  We rode in trucks (laughter).  So I'm sitting in the back of this truck, waiting to go on parade, and the general of the entire Illinois National Guard (laughter) comes over.  And he comes over to me and he says "You're Black, aren't you?"  And I everybody laughed, you know.  I (laughter) said "Yes, sir."  He said, "I've been hearing about you."  He said, "you wanna, you wanna be in the, in the photo unit."  I said, "Yes, sir."  He said, "Well, I'll tell you what, why don't you come down from here.  You go over there, and today you work over there in the photo unit.  And you can stay over there for the rest of the week, and we'll, we'll work on that, and maybe you can be there for the rest of your time."  So that's what happened, and that's how I got attached to the Illinois National Guard photo unit (laughter).
Story_ID: 79353
Speaker 1: So, you knew from high school on that you wanted to be a photographer?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, I was--I knew--I didn't know exactly which way I was gonna go with it, but I did know that I wanted to be a photojournalist; I knew that.  And it was about that time that I learned about [HM] Gordon Parks.  And when I began to study his work and see his work, I said, oh yeah, this is what I wanna do.  I didn't know if I would have an opportunity to do it at a place like "Life," but I knew I wanted to do it somewhere.  And then I began to really look and study the work of other photographers, even the local guys that, that worked at the, the [Chicago] Defender.  [Herman Santonio] "Tony" Rhoden and Cleo Lyle, I used to study their work, how they took their pictures.  If I saw them out someplace, I'd watch 'em, you know, and see how they would handle an assignment, and how--if they used flash, how they would light it and all that.  Then I would look at the results of the paper and see what they got and everything.  So, as I--and I would ask questions, and these guys were very nice.  They would, they would tell me a lot of things, so I learned a lot from 'em.  So, but every week, when "Life" magazine--in those days it came out every seek.  It was a big magazine.  And I would go and get a "Life," and I would look first to see if Gordon's name was still in the masthead, you know, see--make sure they hadn't fired him yet.  And (laughter) he was still there.  And then the next thing, I would look to see if he had a, a special piece that--a photo essay that he had done.  And if he did, I'd go right to that page.  I didn't look at anything else.  And then I began looking at these pictures, and I began to study his work.  And I said oh yeah.  And I remember he, he would shoot everything available light.  And, and, and I started doing also some freelance work for the, for the Defender."  And so I would shoot a lot of techniques that he would use, available light, and (laughter), and it would work.  The stuff would work.  It would look good, but I would always get this bad feedback from the editors of the Defender.  "We can't use this.  You, you didn't, didn't light this up."  I said "Yes, I did.  I used the light that was in the room."  "Oh, this is not gon' work."  I said "Well, Gordon Parks does that" (laughter).  And it was a woman.  Her name was Alberta Meyers, and she said "Well, you're not Gordon Parks, and you--and it's not gon' work in our paper."  I said, "Well, just try it, just try it."  And of course, (unclear) had to go with it, and it worked.  You know, for whatever reason, it reproduced well, it looked good, and it worked.  And I said oh, okay, you know.  So then I began to use flash, try to use it more creatively when I could.  I would sneak a shot in there that wasn't done with flash, and (laughter), and most of the time (laughter) it worked out better than the flash shot did.  So, but he was my inspiration, and whether--to, to tell me that if he could do it at that time, at some point in time, I'll be able to do that somewhere.

Speaker 1: And, and so, but the [Chicago] Defender was my very first point of where I entered into the business of photojournalism.  And actually, how that happened, it was shortly after my high school graduation [1957].  They had a, a section; you know, they used to have a section called the "Billiken" section.  Well, they, they, they upgraded to try to attract a little bit older reader, and they had a section they introduced called the "Teen Page."  And most of the stories and everything that was gonna be written for that page was gonna be done by young people.  But they didn't have a photographer for it, so I went down there one day and just inquired about it.  I said you guys have a photographer to do those things, a young photographer?  They said no, we don't.  I said well, can I do that?  You know, I can take pictures.  They said oh, you can?  I said yeah.  So, they said well, okay, let's give it a try.  And sure enough, I got to do it.
Speaker 2: Now how old were then?
Speaker 1: Oh, I, I was eighteen at the time.
Speaker 2: And that's, that's before you went to [Illinois] National Guard?
Speaker 1: Right, right, right, that was before.  So I had already begun to begin to submit my, my--to learn my skills and hone my craft.
Speaker 2: And when you were freelancing for the Defender, how old were you?
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: Before the--or, or, or after the National Guard?
Speaker 1: It was, it was before the National Guard.
Story_ID: 79355
Speaker 1: The National Guard came later.  That, I was like 21, 22 when the National Guard situation happened.  And by that time, I, I was pretty much firm.  But you know, life is a learning experience, and you're always learning.  And they did give me a correspondence course in photography from their school up in New Jersey, Fort Monmouth, that they, they sent me, and I, I, I went through that course and everything.  But all the basics pretty much I knew about at that time, and I was able to fit right into their program.  And like I said, we were using the 4x5 Speed Graphic, so that was, that was an experience (laughter), trying to be creative with a Speed Graphic.
Speaker 2: Now, now did they, did they provide you with--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Oh, they provide--that was all, that was all military.  That was all military, yeah.  And I learned how to make large volumes of prints in the darkroom.  You know, they had an interesting style of doing that, you know.  And I learned how to do, to, to run through 15, 20 prints at a time in a tray, you know, and I still know--
Speaker 2: You had the dry (unclear)--was it, was it--
Speaker 1: Drum dryer, right it was a drum dryer, and it had heat on it, and with, with (unclear) typing surface.  I still remember the terms (laughter).  And so, yeah, and, and during our biggest time--was during summer encampment when we would provide all the photographs for that day.  We'd go out and shoot, then we'd spend all that afternoon making the prints and everything.  And also, when the riots occurred, during the King riots [after the assassination of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1968] I believe it was--I think it was, yeah--we were activated for that time.  And in the military there's a saying that you are a soldier first and whatever other job you do comes second, and--but I reversed (laughter) it in my mind.  I was a photographer first.  And in, in the, the assigned weapon for photographers in the military at that time--I don't know if it's changed any or not--was the .45 pistol.  You didn't carry a rifle or anything.  So they were issuing all these weapons and everything, and they were getting ready to issue me one.  I said, "I don't want that"--said "what do you mean you don't"--I said, "I don't want that."  "Well, you got-" I said, "No, give me the camera.  That's my weapon.  I don't need that," you know.  So I, I didn't.  I just took the camera, and my job was to document what the National Guard's activity was out on the street, so that was what I did.  I didn't want--for some reason, I wasn't concerned about I was gon' have to shoot somebody.  I didn't, I didn't think it was to that point.  I didn't think it was that serious.  I understood what was going on and why it was happening, so I didn't really have any fear.  I didn't think I needed it, so I didn't.  And it wasn't until later that I heard [HM] Gordon Parks when he was talking about his choice of weapons, you know, was his camera, rather than trying to be violent in return to people.  And so, but, yeah, so without even knowing it, that was my choice, and that was my camera.  If I couldn't do it with the camera, I couldn't do it at all.
Story_ID: 79356
Speaker 1: How did you get your first, like, full-time job as a photographer?
Speaker 2: Well, it, it came at the [Chicago] Defender.  [HM Robert] Bobby Sengstacke, the, the owner's [John H. Sengstacke] son, called me one day, and I had just been talking with him a few weeks earlier--said you guys ever get an opening down there, you let me know.  'Cause at the time I was doing it on the side, and I was really working--I've, I've done a lot of jobs.  And one was a, a technician in the physiology department at Northwestern's medical school [Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois], and so I learned a little bit how to operate on (laughter) dogs and things.  And, and I also did photography there.  They had an in-house organ that I did the photographs for.  It was a pretty good.  One of the doctors, he, he let me do all the pictures for it, and it worked out pretty good.  And there I could really re--I could really try different things, and they were very supportive of me, of me trying to be creative and everything.  So I got to know a lot of people around the hospital again that access, you know.  I was almost--I was in the operating rooms, and I was all over the place, which was great 'cause you got to meet a lot of people that way.  So, but my first real job, full-time job, came when Bobby Sengstacke called me and he said "Hey, we got an opening.  You wanna come down and try?"  I said yeah, so I went down and that's how I all started, and that was my first full-time job there.  And I, I was there about three years before going to the sa- [Chicago] Sun-Times.
Speaker 1: Now, now, now that's from, from what year to what year?
Speaker 2: Sixty-five [1965] to sixty-eight [1968].  And during that time, those were really good years.  I learned a lot.  I tried a lot of things.  I, you know, I was really beginning to tr--learn my craft and, and really get into it.  I was very dedicated to the craft of photography.  I was very passionate.  A lot of times they would give me an assignment I saw it had some latitude on, I would turn it into something a lot more than they expected.  I never will forget I, I worked on a, a story about karate for about a month before I (laughter) turned it in.  And they kept saying "Are you through with that story?"  I said "Oh no, I'm still working on it."  And so it turned out they ran--they've never--I--it's hardly any paper's done this - they ran that story for two--three days I think it was.  I had so many pictures and so many different ways to tell the story that they ran a full page, you know, in the weekend edition, which had never been (laughter) done before.  So I was able to have a lot of creative latitude during that time.  We had a guy named Dave Potter, who was the editor, and he just gave me the latitude to work with, which was great, even had a chance to work with one, one of the best reporters in the world, Betty Washington, who's now passed away.  But she, she went up to Milwaukee [Wisconsin] one weekend to cover those open housing marches that this priest was organizing, helping the community to organize, Father [James] Groppi.  And he was--they were turning Milwaukee upside down up there.  And she went one weekend, and went--and then she did a story.  It was a great story.  I said we got a, "We gotta do pictures on this.  This is, this is visual."  So the next weekend I went with her.  We spent the whole weekend up there.  She worked me to death (laughter), 'cause she was also passionate about her craft.  And so the two of us together, we were just out there night and day, night and day, on the street, you know, with no letup.  And, and we spent all our money, and they had to bail us out.  They had to send us more money, much to the (laughter) chagrin of the publisher.  But we were busy working, and we, you know, we had to spend some money to do it.  But it worked it fine.  They ran the pictures, and that was my satisfaction.  And they ran 'em really well, and we had a great time.  And that's when we did a piece on the, the condition of medical health care in the black community.  And so one of the stories was spending the night at Provident Hospital's Emergency Room.  And I shot it with one camera, and one lens, and very quietly, and it worked it really well, again, with Betty Washington.  She was a really, really great person to work with.
Story_ID: 79357
Speaker 1: You shot available light?
Speaker 2: Available light, available light.  That's, that's--I, I started doing that, and I've still, to this very day, worked that way.  A flash, I use it very sparingly, and when I, only when I really have to.  And when I do, if I can, I'll bounce it off the corner of a room or something like that, just to kind of fill up the room a little bit more, heighten the, the ambient light a little bit.  But, other than that, I shoot it, I shoot ambient light, even with the newfangled digital cameras I do that.
Speaker 1: What do you have to do to be able to, to shoot like that?  I mean, do you push film a lot of or do you--
Speaker 2: Well, no, in the early days you did that.  You don't really have to do that anymore.  Film is now so sensitive, in that you really don't have--and the, and the lenses are fast.  And so, you just open the lens up and just use the fast lens and what it's designed for.  So if you got a 1.4 lens, and it calls for you to open up the 1.4, just open it up and just shoot.  Oh, yeah, your depth of field will be a little shallow.  In order words, the point in front of it and in back of that subject is not gonna be that sharp.  But that's okay, 'cause that's--usually, you don't want any of those elements sharp.  You want that subject to be sharp.  So, so, yeah, I'll, I'll, I'll do it in a heartbeat, just open it up if I have to, and it looks so much better.  And if you're in a sensitive situation, you don't want to call attention to your presence.  You wanna keep that presence as low key as possible.  One of the things that people, when the pay me a compliment, one of the biggest compliments they can pay me is that, when I finish shooting, they said "Did you take any pictures?"  I say "Yeah, I was shooting all the time."  "Okay, I didn't see any flashes."  I say, "Well, that's okay, and don't worry, it'll be all right."  Of course, sometimes you have to shoot with a slow shutter speed on certain occasions.  And you might get some blurred shots, but you keep at it, you'll get enough that are sharp that'll get you through it okay.  And I learned to shoot with slow shutter speed a long time ago when I was younger, and my hands were steadier.  And (laughter) so, and so it's just a technique that I've, you know, I've just, I just do it without even thinking about it, you know.  And that was one of the first things I learned, you know, keep your elbows into the side, you know, and brace the camera against your, your, your cheek.  And, and this is the only thing that's supposed to move.  Hold your breath.  And well, you--now I just do instinctively.  I don't even think about it, or if I--if there is a solid wall behind me, I'll brace myself against that wall and just shoot, and even with long lenses, you know.  And some of my colleagues on the street now--you know everybody's using their flashes and everything--they say "you're not using your flash?"  I said "No, no, don't need that" (laughter).  It's a different look, and it's a nice look.  I like it whenever I can do.  It, it, it just--and you know, if you're covering a funeral, or you're in a sensitive situation, or you just don't want to, to intrude into it, it's, it's the best way to go.  And it, it, it takes--there's a little more effort sometimes, and yes, you will get some blurred shots, but for the most part, it'll, it'll work pretty good.
Story_ID: 79358
Speaker 1: Now, now, I don't think we ev--we ever talked about how you got the job at [Chicago] Sun-Times [in 1968].  How did you, how, how did that happen?
Speaker 2: Well, I was very fortunate to, while I was in the Illinois National Guard's photo unit, to have come across a person by the name of Bob Langer, who at that time, worked for the [Chicago] Tribune, and I was, I was at the [Chicago] Defender then.  And he was a great guy, and he would try to get me a, a spot at the Tribune's--in the Tribune photo lab.  And I, you know--he, and he, he was oblivious to the fact that the mindset wasn't quite right in the Tribune.  He was fine, but the mindset of the other people at the Tribune were fine, and I knew that.  But because of his--you know, our relationship and his effort to try to see what he could do, I said "Okay, fine."  So I went down, did the interview, but I knew I wasn't gonna get it.  But because he was determined to try to help me, I went, I went with it.  And it didn't stop there.  When, when that didn't happen, he later changed jobs and went to the Sun-Times.  And because he wasn't gonna be able to get on the street, 'cause at those--in those days, most of the photographers who got onto the street, they started out as an apprentice in the darkroom.  You had to pay your dues working in the darkroom.  And once the chief photographer, who ran those departments, those photo departments, like fiefdoms, if he tapped you on the shoulder and anointed you, then you could come to the street, and then you was king of the road.  And he, Bob Langer (laughter), rubs the chief photographer of the Tribune the wrong, the wrong way, because Bob Langer was a guy, he, he had creative ideas; he had a different way of wanting to do things, and it didn't sit well with the guy.  And this guy told him he was gonna never get on the street (laughter) as long as he worked there, so then he changed jobs.  He went to the Sun-Times, and there he became to the--there as a street photographer.  And I don't think he was there a year before he was able to get me on there.  He had some help unwittingly, though, because of the riots and everything that were occurring.  And so, together with Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.], you know--'cause he had been assassinated then--with Dr. King--Gor--
Speaker 1: When he came to Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: When he came to Chicago [in 1967]--and the riots that occurred [in 1968], and then Bob Langer, who was saying oh, when the, when the Sun-Times said "Oh, well, we need a, a black photographer," Bob Langer said, "I know the guy."
Speaker 1: So, so were you the first?
Speaker 2: I was the second.  John Tweedle was the first.
Story_ID: 79359
Speaker 1: John Tweedle was the first photographer.  I was the second one to go downtown.  Tweedle went to the [Chicago] Daily News.  He had come to the Daily News.  He used to be a photographer at Channel 11, WTTW.  And one of the women was on the board at TTW, her husband ran the [Chicago] Sun-Times, Emmett Dedmon.  And she liked Tweedle's work, and she thought, well, maybe he ought to come downtown and work for us, so she asked her husband to talk to him and look at his work.  And at the time, they didn't happening at the Times, but he took him over and introduced him to his counterpart at the Daily News--cause they were all in the same building--and they took him right on.  And so he opened the door, and his work was tremendous.  I mean, he had one of the most dynamic images of the Richard Speck murders.  I don't know how he did it.  He--but he was able to get a shot of a nurse's cap sitting on a, a divan by a window, the bloody cap and everything just sittin' there as a mute, you know, testament to what had happened there.  I mean, just that shot, it was--in those days, the nurses still wore caps--and it was great, it was a great shot.  One of his most dynamic shots of Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was when he came to speak at Soldier Field [Chicago, Illinois].  Tweedle was right on the platform.  In those days, you had, you had total access.  You know, you didn't have all this, the security stuff that you got now.  So he was right up on the platform, and when King stretch his hand, hand out like this, Tweedle was right there.  He had a wide angle, and he--the, the image is such, the fist is kind of looming up in the lens, and you see King's face, you know, and it's just, it's a magnificent image, magnificent.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) that's a classic shot.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, yeah.  Of all the images of King, I, I've never seen anything as, as dynamic as that.  And then he did another one that I'll never forget.  Duke Ellington hadn't too long passed, and it was just during the time we were having one of the jazz festivals out at Grant Park.  And Tweedle, with his way of capturing things just, just a symbol, just before the, the show was due to start, Toodle [sic, Tweedle] got up on the stage and made just a shot of the empty piano, nobody there, just sitting there against the backdrop of the audience, of the bandshell.  It was magnificent.  You know, he had, he had a way of being able to do that.  He, was, he was great; he was really great.  He was a good colleague too, very good colleague.  'Cause when I came there, he said now I'm gon' show you all the stuff that you need to know and all the people you need to know, you know, and, and the people you need to avoid.  So, he was (laughter), he was very supportive in getting me through the, you know, the hurdles and everything.
Speaker 2: Can you spell his name for us?
Speaker 1: Yes, John, J-O-H-N, Tweedle, T-W--T-W-E-E-D-L-E.
Speaker 2: That's it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now he, he, he had documented Operation PUSH a lot.  He took a lot of--
Speaker 1: Yes, he did.
Speaker 2: --pictures--
Speaker 1: A lot of pictures of [HM Reverend] Jesse [Jackson].  He, he, he documented Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.].  He was very close to Dr. King.  He knew him well.
Story_ID: 79360
Speaker 1: As a matter of fact, when the word came down that [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] had been, been assassinated and killed [April 4, 1968], I'll never forget when that, when that happened.  I had just finished work at the paper that night, and I was on my way to a meeting of the Chicago Associate--Chicago Press Photographers Association were having their annual monthly meeting.  And when I got there, I had heard about it.  I had already heard about it.  [John] Tweedle, they were having dinner, and I understand when word came down, Tweedle just, he just broke up.  And they had to take him out of there, take him off to another room because, I mean, he, he and Dr. King were very, very close.  And so when I got there, they were trying to calm him down and everything.  And, but, yeah, he was, he took it very hard and, and so did I.  So, the only thing I knew to do was to--that very night, you know, I was restless, and I was just torn up, so I just hit the street to find ways to illustrate how people were feeling.  And there was an impromptu, you know, ser--actually it wasn't a service.  It was just Liberty Baptist Church opened their doors for people to come in, just to be there, just to have a place to come to in the community.  So I went there.  I took one camera and one lens, and I just quietly made photographs as people went through their grief and emotions.  And, again, I didn't wanna call attention to myself in any way at all.  And that was how I expressed how I was feeling, you know, 'cause what they were feeling, I was feeling the same thing.  So, that's how I, I, I responded to that, and it, it ran double truck in the paper the next day.  And I was already off, but I just couldn't stand--I couldn't sit still, you know, yeah.  So, yeah, so Tweedle, he opened the door, and I followed him later, a couple of years after that.  And Betty Washington, she left the [Chicago] Defender a year or two after I did and went to the [Chicago] Daily News.  That was her paper; she always wanted to work at the Chicago Daily News, and she finally got to do it.  And then later John White came on board at the Daily News.
Speaker 2: Now, now when the Daily News shut down, that, that had to be in--
Speaker 1: Seventy-six [1976].
Speaker 2: Seventy-six [1976].  What did--was Tweedle picked up by another paper or?
Speaker 1: No, he had left by that time.  He was working for the city [Chicago, Illinois], for Mayor [Michael Anthony] Bilandic, as a matter of fact, yeah, at, at the time Daily News closed.  So he had become, he had gone to the dark side, as we say (laughter).  So, so that's where he was.  That's where--he was at work when he passed.  He had a heart attack while there.  He was talking on the phone with his wife when it, when it happened.  But he was start--he was, he, he, he had become a city photographer, and he was, you know, he was breaking all kinds of records over there too.  So he was, he was a great guy, great guy.  And so he kind of paved the way for all of us to, to follow in through the Chicago Press Corps.
Story_ID: 79361
Speaker 1: Now what, what were some of your most memorable experiences as a photographer for the press, for the [Chicago] Defender and [Chicago] Sun-Times?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy, one was with the Defender, while there, the Milwaukee [Wisconsin] open housing marches [1967-1968]. That was a very memorable time, 'cause they were turning that city upside down.  And every night they were out there, you know, and taking abuse from the people who didn't like what they were doing.  And so I, I had a chance to be, to be on the inside of that and, and follow that through, and then, just here in the city [Chicago, Illinois], being able to--at the time, the Defender was doing really meaningful stories about the black community here in Chicago.  And so I had a chance to work on a lot of those stories, along with Betty [Washington].  And the housing-- the health care was one.  I think we did something on housing, and we just did a, a lot of things that I just wish I had access to those negatives now.  But it, it really gave me the kind of insights that were very helpful for me to understand what was really--how the people were really suffering in some areas in the cities.  And, and, and it caused me to, to want to use my camera to try to express those situations, and to--so I dug in as deeply as I could.  I would spend time way beyond what was expected of me.  If it meant that the picture I needed to get was gonna occur at 9:00 at night, even though I was supposed to be through at five, it didn't matter, I was out there.  If I had to be up early in the morning, I was there, whatever it took for me to get what I needed to do, to tell the story of people of--who couldn't tell their story really well.  I recall during the riots on the West Side, I was day and night, you know, very fatigued, but I had to be there.
Speaker 1: And you had double duty then--(unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --(unclear)--
Speaker 2: --yeah, with the--well, see, I, I couldn't double duty with the Defender at the time.  I had to strictly go with the [Illinois] National Guard.  But what I did--not only did I document their activity, but I also told the story from the people's point of view too.  'Cause I had the access, I could do that very easily, and nobody would never know which way I was coming from, 'cause I had the uniform.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--the National Guard (unclear) like--
Speaker 2: Yeah, whatev--what, whatever--how they were interacting, how, what, whatever their duties were, and then I would try to capture how the people were feeling, try to catch it on their faces and whatnot.  Even if they had a negative reaction to the National Guard people, I would try to capture that, 'cause since I had the access, I just used it as, as much as I could.
Story_ID: 79362
Speaker 1: Let me ask you--I was asking you about some memorable moments, but I think one thing we probably need to know is what's your routine.  You were talking about that during the break, you know.  What is a--what does a photog--a press photographer do a daily basis?  What's, what's your day like?
Speaker 2: Okay, it could start almost any time, depending on what's, what's gonna happen that day.  But, for the most part, a normal day I start at 2:00 in the afternoon.  I call in work somewhere, but sometimes I don't call in until about 1:30 to find out what my first assignment.  And invariably they'll say oh, we got something for you at 2:00--so okay (laughter).  And then they'll give it to me on, on the radio, or they'll put the information, more detailed information, in the pager, and at which time I proceed to it.  Now, a day can start out in the mayor's office downtown.  It could start out at a bad fire someplace.  Just recently, it could have easily started out in Cicero [Illinois], trying to track down the exploits of Betty Loren-Maltese (laughter), or it could be a train derailment that perhaps took place a little earlier, but they're continuing to follow it.  So, the early people have been called off, and then they re-re-staff it with, with the late afternoon person.  And then it can go from there to a society affair, where people coming in their tuxedos, and I'm there with my jeans, and nobody cares 'cause they want their picture in the paper (laughter).  And--because I could go from there down to the deep tunnel where they're doing that big deep tunneling projects that's been going on for years.  So it's no telling where I could be.  I could end up at a very smoky fire.  This is all, this could all happen in one day.  Also, a police officer could be shot, and I have to track and chase that down.  It just--it could be--and these are things that could happen all in the course of a day.  For instance, Friday--was it Friday?  Yes, this past Friday I was, I started out with an interview with Dave Hoekstra, one of our musical art entertainment writers, interviewing two Hollywood stars.  They had just finished doing a film, and they were in town promoting it, so I started my day out with that.  From there I went to cover the funeral service of, of Mrs. [Mamie Elizabeth Till-] Mobley, Emmett Till's mom.  And then from there, I went for a gala at the opera.  So, you know, it's kind of--it could go all kinds of different ways, and you just never know where you're gonna be.  And that's the, one of the most interesting things about what I do - my days can be extremely different.  And sometimes they can be routine, you know, you do the same old stuff, the mayor's office, or a press conference.  But sometimes it can be very, very un-routine, and that's what, that's what I like about it, just being out here on the street capturing the pulse of the city, the sound of the city, the smell of the city, trying to get my hands on it.  It's, it's, it's, it's quite a challenge sometimes.  And then occasionally, like last night I did a basketball game.  Who was it?  Oh, it was UIC [University of Illinois at Chicago], the Flames, against Cleveland State [University in Cleveland, Ohio].  UIC won it (laughter).  But it's a different now.  It used to be that all you'd have to run to the scene, and, and shoot real fast, and then run back to the office and get the film processed, and somebody would have to look at it and edit it.  You don't have to do that anymore.  We now shoot with digital cameras.  So, you run to the scene if it's an emergency type assignment, but once there, you can take the pictures as efficiently, as fast as you possibly can, but you don't have to run back like you used to anymore.  I can go right to the car now, take my laptop out, take the card out of the camera and put it into the laptop, edit some images and hook up to my cell phone, and send those images back and have that back long before I could physically go back to the office.  And so, it's, it's a whole different day, and, and it's a day I didn't think if someone had told me this is how we would be handling our pictures thirty-five years ago, I would have told them they were crazy.  They don't know what they're talking about; they're drunk; they're smoking something, but that's how we're doing it, and it's great.  I love every moment of it.  I could e--go to an assignment--my first assignment could be someplace, and then before I can get back, they're sending me someplace further.  But they need what I have the first, at the first assignment for the, the next morning's edition.  So what I do, I just work on that real quick, edit a couple of images, and then once I see that what I have, put the caption on it, hook it up to the cell phone, get it started.  And then once I see it's starting to transmit, just take off, go on to the next assignment, and the image is transmitting as I drive along.  So it's, it's a great day, it's the new day, and I like that.
Story_ID: 79363
Speaker 1: So it doesn't--it takes some of the stress out, because you're not stressed out trying to get back and meet deadlines.  And they're not bothering you on the radio, wanting to know what your ETA is.  It's there in no time at all.  I've had situations where I've sent some stuff back as I finished the assignment, and before I can pull away from the curb, the picture is in there, you know, so.  And in the early days, when the Associated Press was the only one doing that on big events like the Democratic National Convention, I think when [President Bill] Clinton was giving his acceptance speech for being nominated, before he finished his speech, they had pictures going around the world.
Speaker 2: Now is that what they call an AP [Associated Press] laser photo?  When you see that in the paper, is that what that--
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know if they--they don't call it laser photo anymore, because they don't do that that way.  It's just an AP photo now.  At one time it was, it was, it was laser.  But in remote areas of the world, they used satellite phones, because there's no infrastructure.  We've torn it up with our bombing; so there's no phone lines.  They use satellite (laughter) phones.  That's very expensive though, and they have to do it, and each organization have to have their own capability to get to the satellite.  They cannot depend on military people to do it for 'em, 'cause--
Speaker 2: They're not going to share.
Speaker 1: They're not gonna share it, and if you make 'em mad for something you did or covered, they will cut you off (laughter).  But, so that's, that's a typical day for me.  It, it can run the whole gamut, from society to funerals to galas at the opera, and, and you (unclear), you have all that in one day, you know, and maybe somebody doing a good deed.  You're meeting someone at the airport who haven't seen a relative for, since they were born almost.  So it's--and, and it's, it can that gamut, and it's nice.  You never know where you're gonna end up.  You can--that's why you wear clothes that are somewhere in between.  It's not your designer suits or anything.  And in the early days, before I even came on board, the old, the old timers, they used to wear suits and fedoras, and shirts and ties, but the younger guys, as they were coming on, they would--if you covered a fire, you got into it, you know.  You didn't mind getting the smoke and everything on you.  You just got all smoked up, and you just got smoked out; you know, that's all it was to it.  And so you didn't wanna wear your designer suits and whatnot, so you wore things that you, you felt, you could feel comfortable crawling around.  'Cause I have been in situations where I've had to crawl under something or get down into a hole in the ground or, or a hole or, or a basement, the dirty basement of a building, you know, walking up the stairs of CHA [Chicago Housing Authority] in, in darkened hallways and all that, so--and smelling all kinds of stuff in the hallway, so it's a--you never know where you're gonna be.  Sometimes you go into a fired building that has already been burned out, and you, and you're looking for a different way to get the shot.  So you'll go inside of the building, and you have to be very careful 'cause you got exposed nails and stuff all around and broken windows and, and everything.  So you, you find ways to do that without hurting yourself.  And occasionally, you just never know.  I've, I've had to duck, dodge bullets, and, and police billy clubs.  Those were the old days.  Police are a little nicer now.  They--but (laughter), but--
Story_ID: 79364
Speaker 1: You covered the riots in the--
Speaker 2: I covered pretty much all the riots, starting with--
Speaker 1: Down to the, the '68' [1968] Democratic Convention--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, I was on the street.  I got beat up by the cops.  My, my name is listed among the casualties in that Kerner Report [1968], when they list all the casualties, you know, the news people, the civilians.  And, and my name is in that report.  And every once in a while, I'll get a call from some college student who's studying that time, and (laughter) they'll ask me about it.
Speaker 1: Now what, what, what actually happened?  Did they, did, did they try to get your camera from you or something?
Speaker 2: Well, no, at that time, the police were, they were gonna do things they knew they shouldn't have been doing, so they did a number of things.  They would take their badges off, in some cases; they would take the name tag off, in a lot of cases; and the person that they would go to, or the people they would go to, first to take 'em out was the media, because they didn't have--they didn't want us recording any of that stuff, so they were--everybody was--it was open season on the media during that time.  So they would try to take us down first.  And once they could kind of disrupt us, then, then they would go for the other people, and so it would minimize them getting recorded.  Well, it didn't really work, because there's always somebody you're not gonna get.  And they still got, you know, busted, you know.  So it, it--
Speaker 1: Well, what, what was your strategy in that kind of situation?  Did you just run or were you--
Speaker 2: Well, if, if they were coming at you directly, yeah, you'd run, get out of the way, try to sideswipe 'em or out-flank 'em, and find another way to try to get another position.  Because it was so widespread that they really could not actually--ones--because they, they, they, they didn't have a, a real plan, so they would just charge you.  And when you saw 'em charging, you just kind of scatter, unless they reach out and grab you.  There were a couple of times I had one that actually hit me with the billy club, you know, right across the back.  That's not a very good feeling.  So I, I actually made a police report.  I was--I had to be treated, and that's how my name got into the Kerner Report.
Story_ID: 79365
Speaker 1: But it's a little different now.  If they [the police] don't want you to be in a certain spot, they just put up the yellow tape, and you just don't go across the yellow (laughter) tape, you know.  I've had situations where they have told me "You can't come in here."  I said "Oh, okay, fine," and I find another way.  And I find myself inside the location, you know, and I didn't have to bother with that officer.  I found another way that--'cause they can't guard everything all the time.  And sometimes that doesn't--you have to be careful of that.  It could work against you.  'Cause one time that happened, I was in the fired building itself.  And it looked okay; it didn't look so bad.  There was smoke in the back, and the fire department was working toward the back of the building.  And me and a few of my colleagues were in there.  We were kind--it wasn't anything to shoot.  We had shot most of what we could shoot, but we were just standing there in the building kind of chewing the fat a little bit.  And all of a sudden, one of the firemen yelled out from back there.  He said "Everybody out of this building now!"  What had happened, it was a false ceiling, pretty much like this, and they pulled that ceiling down, and there was fire running all the way through there.  And they could see it, and they saw, and they knew what was gon' happen.  They knew that that had weakened the roof of the building, and they just--everybody out.  And I don't think we got out to the sidewalk--I don't know--maybe a minute before we got out there, that roof came right down, so it was this--you know.  So sometimes you have to--I don't do that anymore, but I'm very careful about all that now, and I watch where I'm at.  But sometimes in the heat of a situation, you, you can lose track of where you are.  You're trying to get that shot, and you have to be, you still have to be careful.  And that's why people don't understand when they see stuff on TV from tragic situations or in war-torn areas, those pictures that they're seeing are taken by people who are putting their lives on the line, and many cases, some lives are lost trying to get those images back to 'em.  So it's not an easy thing to do all the time.  And in war areas, there, the bullet doesn't say well, we're not gonna hit that cameraman 'cause he's trying to get a job done.  Yeah, that doesn't, doesn't matter.  But, and even in domestic situations you have to be very careful, because sometimes the people whose story you're trying to tell, they'll turn against you, 'Cause everybody blames us for everything, so they'll turn against you as well.  So you have to be so careful.  There's a very fine line you have to walk.  You can't look and even appear as you favoring one side over the other.  So it's--like (laughter) at political rallies and stuff, the political candidate tries--they're passing out buttons and literature.  And they try to pin you with the candidate's (laughter) pin, and you have to politely tell 'em, no, I can't wear that, you know, 'cause you, you, you just can't do it.  I had an alderman do that to me recently.  You know, she gave me--it's a nice pen too.  It was pretty slick.  I couldn't wear that (laughter).  So, yeah, so you have to be careful that you don't cross that line, and because, well, you're supposed to be able to be free to tell both sides, and let the people decide what they wanna feel when they, when they read or see the picture.  And the picture has to be honest, and, and, and you shouldn't be tampering with it.  You just shoot the picture, and you, and you let the, and let it tell the story for itself.
Story_ID: 79366
Speaker 1: Now are you ever sent on assignment outside of Chicago [Illinois] or, or, or overseas or anything?
Speaker 2: No, the [Chicago] Sun-Times is not geared for--they, they don't do that.  I have been on--out of town on overseas assignments for other clients, 'cause I've always have diversified myself while being there.  I've always done work outside of there for other clients that are not in conflict, of course, with, with the newspaper.  And as a result, some of those clients have sent me to places around the world.  I was in the '83' [1983], the '8--no, the '88' [1988] Olympics in [Seoul] Korea.  I went there for the Brunswick Corporation.  They were trying to get bowling as a, as an Olympic sport, and they got it--they got as far as getting it to be a demonstration sport.  And I used to take a lot of pictures for them, so they sent me over to document all their activities over there.  And while there, I did a little side job for a travel publication in, in Taiwan, so I had a chance to, to go there while I was there.  So I've been a lot of different places, and did a piece up in the Canadian Rockies at one time.  So, so for--and as a result of my affiliation with the Sun-Times, has been very helpful to gain a lot of those other experiences.  So I've been a lot of places, a lot of places I haven't been that I still gotta go to yet.  But it's because of what I do and the reputation I've accomplished that I've been able to do that.
Story_ID: 79367
Speaker 1: Have you had--have you ever been actually shocked by something you've seen somewhere, and didn't (unclear) when--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I have.  The very first thing that--the very first disaster situation that I ever covered, where you actually saw the raw results of it right in your face, was a plane crash, and it happened at O'Hare [International Airport].  I, I don't think I'd been at the [Chicago] Sun-Times hardly six months before it occurred.  It was an air--it was an airline called National Airlines [sic, North Central Airlines].  And they were--the plane was just about ready to touch down, to land, and for whatever reason, it flipped over.  It hit a hangar out there.  And I was in the office.  It was at night, as a matter of fact.  And the world came over the fire monitor an explosion in a hangar.  There was no description 'cause it was just so quick.  All they had was an explosion in a hangar.  And we heard it and we said "Oh, we'd better go."  So I hit the car, started on my way out there, and on the way there we got word it was actually a plane crash.  I said "Oh, God."  So I didn't know how I was gonna approach it.  They were giving me vectors as to how to get into the location out there, and--because you, you wasn't going into the airport the normal way.  You had to find a back way into it.  So what I did, I just got (laughter)--it was enough fire equipment leaving from the city [Chicago, Illinois] going out there, so I just got in behind one of them and just followed them all the way there.  And in those days, it was a--we, we got to things a lot differently than we do now.  It was a standard procedure that most of the photographers would put red spotlights on their cars.  We always got cars that looked like official cars, dark color and everything, and we'd put red spotlights on 'em.  So I had that thing going.  When I would come up to the intersection right behind the emergency vehicle, I had that on, and they just, just waved me right on through.  And once they wave you through, you have to take it.  You cannot hesitate, 'cause there's too much other stuff, and you just have to go.  They'll stop traffic for you and everything.  So I was able to get into the scene pretty quick, and got into the hangar area.  And it was a sight I had never seen the likes of before, you know, bodies and pieces of bodies.  And, and I think one of the things that kept me from really, you know, falling apart was I was on tight deadline.  And they were gonna be wanting pictures back, and they were gonna be--at that day--in those days, we had just the two-way radio in the car.  And so I know they were gonna be trying to get back in touch with me, trying to figure out what was going on, what did I have, and when can I get back.  And these were the old days when we shot film.  And, and on the other thing, too, there was gonna be a point for which the authorities were gonna be setting up their bureaucracy, and that was gonna get you out of there.  So I had--I was fighting against the time frame for the deadline and the time frame before they decide, well, we're gonna get all these news people out of here.  So I had to shoot quick, fast, in a hurry, furiously, and so there wasn't much time to dwell on the, the carnage that I saw there.  That didn't come till the next day, when I began to think about these people were all right one instant, and the next instant [snapped finger] they were nothing; they were gone.  And you know, then began to, began to see flashbacks of--they were just blankets they could find from the plane and the cover parts of bodies, and take 'em, take 'em away, and put 'em someplace and--but you didn't, you really couldn't think about it at the time, even as you're walking through the scene, you could, you could see these things.
Story_ID: 79368
Speaker 1: And then later, the big train crash, the IC [Illinois Central] train, that took place over there behind Michael Reese Hospital [Chicago, Illinois].  That was another real shocker situation.  Because then, they couldn't, they couldn't block that scene too well, and you could actually see them take bodies out of, of, of the train cars, and some of 'em pretty mangled up.  And one of, one of the--there was a [Chicago] Daily News guy who was on his way back to the office when he saw the trains just after they had collided.  He didn't know what had happened.  It just looked strange.  So out of curiosity, he dro--he turned around and went back, found his way up in there.  He got there before anybody.  And then when he got closer look, he could see--and he got the pictures--legs hanging out from underneath.  I mean it was, it was pretty bad.  You know, so you, you see things like that, but you know, you're so busy working, you don't have time to get too upset by it until later.  I think the thing that upsets you even worse is when a child has been misused, or abused, or killed, or, or something that, and that, that upsets you more than anything.  And it's usually, but it's usually after it's over, because you're so busy working, you just don't have time to think about it.  But you do, later it comes down on you.  I do know when the, the Oklahoma City bombing took place [1995], and this is becoming a, a serious situation now--the 9/11 [September 11, 2001] is another instance--where media people, and I never really thought about it, that we're part of the first responders to these scenes.  So we're sometimes seeing 'em raw, before anything can be done to, you know, to try, you know, cut down on how bad it looks and, because you're right there.  And a lot of people needed to have, they needed to talk to somebody, you know.  And, and they found that in, at, in, in the Oklahoma City bombing; they also found it with 9/11, that people needed to talk to somebody, and, and it's very important.  Because if you don't, it could worry you for a long time.  And so, and, and then, I went to a seminar where they talked about all this, and, and the media is considered part of the first responders that get into a scene.  And, and I never really gave that any thought, but when you think about it, we are 'cause--especially the photogs.  We've got to be there when it's happening.  And we're so wrapped up in trying to get shots and get, and everything, that you never think that, oh yeah, I'm one of the first people here, and you're seeing it really bad.
Story_ID: 79369
Speaker 1: Have you ever been torn between taking a photo and trying to help someone?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, that's, that's, that's a, that's a, a question that's always been discussed, you know, what would we do if we were in a situation and it was just me and that person, would you stop to help or would you take the picture?  And that, that's a question that everybody has always been faced with, but I don't think any--no one yet has had to really deal with it directly.  But I think, if it was me, and it was whether I could save that person, or relieve their pain, I would probably do that first until medical people could get there, then I would turn that over to them, and then I'd go to work.  Sometimes you don't get that close.  You know, when you get into a scene like that it's, everything is just such a mess, all you can do is shoot.  But if I did run across someone who I could help in some way or another, I would probably help them.  I know I probably would do that, rather than take the picture of them, because the picture can come at any time.  Because when the medical people come, you can turn it over to them, then you can go take your pictures and, and get that done.  So I've never had it happen yet, but I'm pretty sure I know which way I'd go on that.  And then there are other people say oh no, take the picture first, you know, and just get the picture 'cause that's the most--that's--you know, 'cause they'll say well, you're intruding into the situation.  That's what they can be coming from.  But when a person's life is at stake, I don't think--I think it's time to intrude, you know, to help save that life or save that limb if you can.  That's, that's the most important thing, 'cause it could you.  You know, it could you.  It's just a matter of minutes that it's not you, that you just wasn't there at that point in time.  'Cause, 'cause we come in after it's happened, and when you think about it, I could be walking through here when this place blew up, you know, or this car come out of control off the street.  So, you would want somebody to help you if you was in that situation.  So that's how I, I look at it - what would I want if I was in that situation?  So that's what I would do.
Story_ID: 79370
Speaker 1: Is there anything--no, who have been some of the more remarkable people you've met, I guess--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, of course, Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was quite a, a remarkable person. and I was enabled to get some interesting pictures of him, a very humble man and wasn't caught up.  You could see it in his persona.  He wasn't really caught up with himself, you know.  He was very accessible.  He always was accommodating to you.  Of course, [Chicago Mayor] Harold Washington, he, was, he was a great guy.  And of course, it really worked well with Harold because a lot of his security people were black contemporaries, and I knew some of 'em, so I had a lot of access where he was concerned, you know.  So it, it, that was a great time.  And then there have been all kinds of people who were not so famous.  I'm trying to think who they are, but they'll come to me at, at some point.  But it's usually the, the person that people don't know, they're not famous, some of those people are quite remarkable in their own special way.  And those are the people that I like to interact with a lot.  And of course, just when you think you've seen all that you can see, there's something else that comes along and you can't believe it, especially with politicians (laughter).
Story_ID: 79371
Speaker 1: Oh, this was made in 1957, when I was gonna become a photographer for the Chicago Defender's teen page.  They had a, a section that was produced by teenagers.  They wrote the articles.  And, and they didn't have a photographer in that age group, so I went down one day and asked, well, you got all these young people writing, how about somebody to take the pictures?  And they thought it was quite a novel idea, and they said "Yeah, why don't you do it?"  So, that's how I got it.  And my, one of my teachers in school made this photograph, Mr. Bailey, 'cause they wanted to run the picture in the, in the paper to show that they had a photographer for the, for the teen page.
Speaker 2: Birthday party?
Speaker 1: It was a birthday party at one of my cousins, and I don't remember which cousin it was.  But I remember at all the parties the families would always have pictures made.  And everybody would gather around the table, and so this was one of those events.  This has to go back very easily to the very early '50's [1950s], very early '50's [1950s].
Speaker 2: This is Bob Black, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughter), yeah, 'cause I, I can see one of my older cousins to the far right hand bottom corner, right here.  No, no, right here.  You just--go back, go back, right there, right there in the dark outfit.  I think that's Carol, yeah--my younger brothers.  I think that's me looking up there, yeah.
Speaker 2: My mother [Elaine Curry Black Martin] had us all in Scouting.  These are my other three brothers [Arnold Black, Clarence Black, and David Black] and myself.  And she had one of her friends come by and make our photographs.  And I was a leader.  I was one--I was an assistant scout master or something at that time.  And that's me on the far right there.  That's my brother, Arnold, in the dark uniform.  He was an explorer.  And that's Clarence just in front of him, and David, and they were both in the first stages of being Boy Scouts.  And that white sash with that arrow on it was, I was a member of the Order of the Arrow, which is a separate, almost fraternal, organization within Scouting itself.  And so that has to be, that dates back easily to I'd say the late '50's [1950s], yeah, late '50's [1950s].  Yeah, all four of us were in Scouting.  She kept us, that's how she kept us busy and off the streets (laughter).
Speaker 1: --photograph in, in, not only in my career, but in the history of our family.  This shows the five, we had five generations at one time in, in the family, due to my brother, Arnold there, holding the fifth generation on his lap.  But in the foreground, you have the, the matriarch, the grand matriarch.  We called her Nana, and she was our great-grandmother.  And her name was Ellen Clark.  And then her daughter, and our grandmother, Janie Curry, sitting right next to her, and we called her "Big Mama" (laughter).  And, and then of course, our mom, Elaine Martin, Elaine Martin Black, at the time--no, I'm sorry, correction--can you take that out?  She was, she was still Elaine Black at the time that picture was made.  She hadn't remarried yet.  And then, of course, my brother, Arnold.  He's, he's next to me.  He's my, he's second in line of, of the, the family of brothers, and then, of course, his first daughter, Kathy, so he gave us five generations.  And this was my effort to illustrate that.  Because even then, I, I had a sense of family and history, and what it meant to have five generations.  I, I knew even then that, that was not something that happened very often, yeah.  And so I wanted to document it in such a way that it was clear and concise.  And so this picture has lasted--I don't have an idea where the negative is.  But my mother has kept all of these items for the longest time, and if she knew I had this in my possession and not in hers, she would shoot me right now (laughter).
Speaker 2: --[great] grandmother had passed.  We still had generations and all through Arnold.  And you can see, he will be seen throughout these generational pictures (laughter), as we put 'em up.  And as a matter of (laughter), fact, we have five generations again, even today, with my mother as now the grand matriarch.  And she's 80--she's 83, and with her, we now have five.  So now it's her, Arnold, his daughter, his daughter's daughter, and I think she has a child.  So, yeah, so we, that gives us five again.  So, so Ar--
Speaker 1: There you go. Yeah. Well, this, this was, this was the four of us.  It was, my mother had four boys, and all the neighbors knew us as the "Black boys."  And (laughter), and so this was in a neighbor's next door swing, the swing next door, I guess that's how you put it.  And they lined us all, set us all up in the swing.  And, and we were line up according to our, our ages and rank in the family.  That, that's me on the far left, and then Arnold is next to me, and then you had Clarence with his hands up there in his mouth--I don't know why he was doing that--and David.  Arnold is, he works for the--he's been working for the post office for the past thirty-some odd years.  And Clarence is a medical technician down in Florida.  And David is a fire, is a fireman, works for the Chicago Fire Department.  Something he's always wanted to do ever since he was a little boy, yeah.
Speaker 2: --I was a little baby.  Yeah, that's me, I don't know how old.  I'll have to ask my mother how old I was, but I wasn't very old.  I guess I had to be no more than eight, eight months old at the time.  And this whole, as a matter of fact, this whole page is historical.  You have my brothers and myself when were just kids.  That's me as a little baby, that you're zooming in on right now.  And then right next to me, the young man in the football jersey, is my son, my oldest son.  He was going to De La Salle [Institute in Chicago, Illinois] at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay, I was gon'--I thought that was Simeon [Career Academy in Chicago, Illinois] at first.  That's, that's De La Salle.
Speaker 2: De La Salle, right.  And he played, he's played on the football team.
Speaker 1: And the picture up above there is--let's see.  I'm trying think.  I think that's--is that my oldest daughter?  I can't remember if that's my oldest daughter or not.  No, that's not her.
Speaker 2: --Deborah, yeah.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  And that's your oldest daughter?
Speaker 2: Right, that's my oldest daughter, Deborah.  She's a mom now, with two children.  And they're both doing very well in school.
Speaker 1: I had it on a long cord, and I, I think I had somebody hold that, hold that flash unit.  And I shot it from this angle, and the light is coming high and from above her, so that I could get nice texture on the face, and nice modeling in the hair and everything.  Yeah, so that, that's Nana, my great-grandmother.  And she--I remember we had a surprise birthday party for her when she was seventy-five.  I was a little boy, but I, I was in the bedroom.  They had put us to bed, but I could hear all the noise out--(laughter) in the room there.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: --great aunt.  We called her Aunt Ceal, and that was my grandmother's sister.  And she lived directly across the street from us, and she was a, a nurse.  She was--she had come up through the old nurse's training back in the day.
Speaker 2: Provident?
Speaker 1: Provident [Hospital of Cook County, Illinois], right, right, yeah, yeah.  And, and so whenever there was anything medically wrong in the family, she always saw to it that we were all taken care of.  She'd come across the street, and come in, and just take over, and just take care of everything, you know (laughter).  Her name was Aunt Ceal.  And, and she sang in the choir church, had a great soprano voice.
Speaker 2: Now, now how do you spell her name?
Speaker 1: Well, let's see--I would think that we would spell it C-E-A-L, 'cause her actual name was Lucille.  That was her actual name, Lucille Walls, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --first time.
Speaker 1: How were you (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Oh, I, I, I know exactly when that was.  That was 1960, because I wanted to be 21.  'Cause in those days, if you weren't 21, you couldn't sign off on your own marriage license.  Somebody had to sign up for you.  So I wanted to be 21, and so that I could sign my own marriage license (laughter).  I didn't want my mother to be signing for me to get married.  And so, so, yeah, I was 21.  It was in 1960.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  Who, who else is in the photograph?
Speaker 2: Well, on the, on the left you have my, my--is the stepfather of, of my first wife.  His name--oh, God, I can't think of his name now.  It'll come to me, but I know his last name was Powe, P-O-W-E, and I can't think of his first name.  And then there was her mom.  Her name was--oh, why is, why is it I can't think of her name, 'cause she was such a sweet woman.  Even after we divorced, she still considered me her, her son-in-law.  It'll come to me.  This is--Louise, yeah, Louise, Louise Powe, yeah, Louise Powe--  And of course, Elizabeth, and then that's me, then my mom, Elaine, and her husband, Herbert [Martin], yeah.
Speaker 1: This is a more recent shot, (unclear) recently during the ordination of the young woman right there, named--
Speaker 2: She got the spirit.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, she's caught up, caught up--Angela Spivey, S-P-I-V-E-Y.  She is a gospel artist.  And this, on this particular occasion, she was being ordained into the ministry.  She had--she was, I think--I don't know if she was licensed to preach, but I know she had been preaching.  But on this one, at this, after this, she can then now marry and she can bury.  Prior to that, she couldn't do that.  It would have been illegal (laughter)--just last year, and it was at her church, which is on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois], and I can't think of the name of the church right now [First Corinthian Baptist Church].  But her dad is right here.  Her dad [Harvey Spivey] is--was--is the pastor of the church.  And, and all these were visiting ministers who had come to help ordain her into the ministry.  And so Angela Spivey does--not only is she a renowned gospel artist, she--a recording start, but she's now become an ordained minister.  So this was at--
Speaker 2: This photograph is very significant for me in so many ways, and, and it's become kind of like my signature piece.  This man was a 111 years old at the time I made the photograph.  And that's his sixth generation granddaughter.  His name was Rutherford B. Hayes Elmore.  At, at the time he was born people named their children after famous people.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: He was named after him, and that's his sixth generation granddaughter.  She has now produced, and through her line alone, she has now--she, she has--they had also a sixth generation with her great-grandmother.  And what's so interesting, I did make that photograph with all the six.  With him, all six weren't available.  There was one person missing, who died at a very young age of a brain tumor.  And I think it was a daughter of his, from Amsterdam, Holland, known as the World Press Photo Foundation and the--this took first place in one of their categories.
Speaker 1: Now was there a story attached to the photo?  I mean was there a, a, a newspaper story--
Speaker 2: Right, this, this appeared in the [Chicago] Sun-Times back in 1983, I believe it was.  And my, my story was actually about him.  He was still very sharp and very lucid.  He remembered a lot of stuff.  He remembered the days that automobiles came in to being.  And he said that people didn't think much of 'em, and they didn't think they were gonna last (laughter) very long.
Speaker 1: Well, this picture was made back in--oh, gosh, this goes back to the mid '50's [1950s], late '50's [1950s], I would believe, yeah, late '50's [1950s].
Speaker 2: This was when he [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: He was in Chicago, and one of his first trips to Chicago, and during a time where there was no security concerns where you could get close enough to be able to get an, an angle like this.  Also, if you notice, this was at the old [International] Amphitheatre, and Dr. King had come to speak for a special program of the Chicago Urban League.  Bill Berry, and--who was the executive director at the time, was around.  And at that time, I wasn't even photographing professionally.  I was working for the Urban League as a office aide.  I was just, not too long, out of high school (laughter), but I--by this time, I had become, you know, reasonably skilled in, in my photography.  And so I, I was there just photographing.  I'd made other shots of him, but I saw how this light was playing on him, and I said let me see if I can include that show, that light in the show.  So I moved around to the side of the podium and got it, and, and that's now become a, one of my hallmark photographs.  And what's so interesting about this, this picture was first displayed--it's never been published; it's never been published.  The first, it was first displayed in fo--an exhibit that I was joint partners with colleagues of mine.  We were the first contingent of black photographers to work for the Chicago newspapers.  John Tweedle had preceded us, but we were the first as a group.  And we got together and we produced this show called "Through Eyes of Blackness."  And one of, one of the guys, [HM] Howard Simmons, it was his brainchild, and it this image was part of that show.  And we blew it up thir--50x4-, 50x70.  It was a pretty big print.  And this was back in the early '70's [1970s].  For reasons that I don't fully understand, I thought the negative was lost to me forever.  I don't know how it got away from me, but it did.  And one day, just last year, I was going through my basement looking for some negatives that I shot, and all of a sudden this cropped up.  I just happened to see this, this (unclear)--this glassine sleeve--it was folded over--and a couple of short strips of negatives.  I said well, let me see what's in here, and I opened it.  This negative fell out.  I had never been so happy in all my life (laughter).  And so I immediately went upstairs, scanned it.  Now in this new days of digital, I was able to scan the negative and put it on a disk so that I wouldn't have to work with the negative, wouldn't have to touch it anymore.  So they're all--any other prints now are made from that disk, and now I know where that negative is.  And while I was there, I even found some other things on, on Thomas A. Dorsey that I'd shot, the father of gospel music.  And, and I didn't know, I, I forgot I had 'em, you know.  And, and they're simple shots, but by--because of who this person was, they're very significant, you know, images.  So, and I'd forgot--a dynamic person in his gestures.  And so I saw it happen a couple of times--say oh, well, I'm just gonna wait here.  And I didn't have to wait too long, but when I saw it, it was no motor.  I just hit it just at that right moment.  And then once I shot it, I left that area.  I didn't, I was through with it.  I could feel it even then that--
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, (laughter).  Yeah, there's only one picture of Dr. King that supersedes this one, and, and is, and that's John Tweedle's photograph of Dr. King making that--
Speaker 2: Making the--
Speaker 1: Making that--yes, yes, I mean--ah.
Speaker 2: --just late last year [2002], as a matter of fact, I think in November.  Yeah, that was in November that I shot this.  This is Von Freeman.  And he performs every Tuesday night at the New Apartment Lounge on 75th Street.  And I'd, I've never been there before, and so, but I, I wanted to get some shots of him 'cause he'd just celebrated eighty years in the, in, of, of performing.  And so I said well, let me go by there and get some shots of Von.  And I'm thinking he's performing on a, you know, a little stage or some type.  So I get there and I kind of look around, and it's just a bar with two sides.  You know, there's, there are two--there's a different side, and this is where you come in the door.  And I'm looking for the stage.  (Unclear) said oh, well, we don't have a stage.  It's, it's right here.  I said oh.  He hadn't arrived yet, so I said well, where does Von Freeman perform?  They said oh, right there, right over there.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) told (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, right next to the jukebox.  I said oh, "Really?"  He said, "yeah."  And there was no light or anything.  I thought there was gonna be a little makeshift stage light or something like that, noth--none of that, none of that.  And I come back later, by the time he's there, the place is packed.  They're coming from everywhere.  As you can see in this photograph, they coming from everywhere to come to the New Apartment Lounge to hear him perform.  And this area right here is a kind of an entrance or passageway to go to the other side of the bar.  So people coming in, if they don't stop there to listen, they just, they're passing through to get to the other side.  There's the door right there, you know.  And he has a side, and he has two side men, a guitarist and, and a, and a drummer.  And, and they're, they're up here.  This--there is a little bit of a stage right here.  And there's not much; it's just a little area in front right by the window.  And so, it was an interesting thing to see.  And it, as I looked at this photograph later, it's kind of remind me of the '40's [1940s], 'cause it has that '40's [1940s] look, you know, the guy with the hat, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, leaning--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, leaning over (laughter), and you know.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--that's--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I said oh, wow, looks like I'm-
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  Got the (unclear) girls--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, so I--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--University of Chicago--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Right.  And, and he's just performing like he's performing before a large audience of people.  He's just pouring his heart out, pouring his heart out.  So later I had a chance to ask him.  I said do they--'cause there was no cover charge or anything, I said "I noticed there's no cover charge."  He said, "Oh no, no, no, can't have a cover charge in here, 'cause nobody will come," you know.  I mean it's not the kind of place people would think: why do they have to charge a cover charge; this is just a neighborhood bar.  And so, so he goes there every Tuesday.  You can catch him there after 9:30.
Speaker 1: Well, this is Michael Morgan, who was at the time the associate music director of the Chicago Symphony [Orchestra].  And this was during a rehearsal session of the younger symphony orchestra that's kind of like the orchestra in training.  And this was during a time that he was getting them ready for a performance.  And, and of course, they conduct performances just like the big orchestra does.  I mean, 'cause this is their way of get--learning how to be professional musicians.  And of course, Michael Morgan, he would prepare them for the performance, and also conduct them, as well as the main orchestra from time to time.  So this was a rehearsal session in Orchestra Hall.  And I had great access.  I was right on the stage, which is something that just isn't done hardly at all, even during a rehearsal session.  But Michael Morgan was, he was a different kind of maestro.  He wasn't tense and, and finicky.  I mean he just didn't mind your presence, and so--and I, I made sure to keep my presence low key.  I didn't interfere with what was going on.  As long as he--and he could sense that, so he never bothered me about being there, and I was able to capture this moment.  This was for a project where I worked on--had the good fortune of working on--known as "Songs of My People."  And it was a project that took place ten years ago, in the early part of 1990 [sic, 1992].  And it was--came about as a result of black photographers not having the opportunities to have their work published in the mainstream photographic medias.  And so a group of young men in, in the New York and Chica--and Washington, D.C., area came together and brought fifty, and brought fifty African-American photographers together from around the country to produce this work.  And of course, the title of the projects was called "Songs of My People."  And we tried to cover the black experience from top to bottom, the good, the bad, and the ugly, some of the ugly, in order to be fair and to be balanced in our portrayal of the black community. And so that, this book is, also was not just a book, but it was a traveling exhibit that traveled the world, as well as the, the United States.  They had venues going from coast to coast.  And it was my blessed, blessed, I was blessed to be able to be a part of this.
Story_ID: 79372
Speaker 1: This, this was from a book project that I worked on known as the "African Americans," and it was, it was published by a group of folk out of San Francisco [California].  They--this was a kind of a, a group that came out of "The Day in the Life of" books.  And this group splintered off and formed, and did their own publishing, and they came up with this idea.  And I was one of the photographers that was invited to par-participate in the project.  And this was one of my subjects, Dr. Julius Williams.
Speaker 2: Wilson.
Speaker 1: Wilson, I'm sorry--Dr. William Julius Wilson.  He was a sociology professor at the University of Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: He's at Harvard [University Cambridge, Massachusetts] in now.
Speaker 1: Is he at Harvard?  Okay.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--(unclear)--
Speaker 1: And I took him out.  We needed to have him with a building boarded up or an abandoned building in the background, and so we found one.  It didn't take much to find one (laughter).
Speaker 2: This is the cover of the book.  As a matter of fact, the, the photographer that made that cover, he had already made this picture for something else.  And as a matter of fact, the circumstances under which he made this picture was, had nothing to do with anything except he was just filling up some time while he was at a convention.  And he just asked people to stop and just sit there before his camera, and as they were passing by and said let me take your picture.  So it just so happened, it worked out real well for this project, and that's, that's how this picture came about.
Speaker 1: And she's very pretty.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah--so, and colleagues that I had not met before, I had just heard about in terms of reputation, in, in both the projects, "Songs of My People," and, and now this one.
Speaker 1: --and them putting on the makeup, getting some last-minute touchup-
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, and she was getting his last-minute check for makeup and everything, and putting on the eye shadow.  And let's see what else.
Speaker 2: This is my son.  He was leaving from prom that same night, so he and his sister was going to the same prom.  And so he was getting a last-minute check from one of the, the men who came by to make sure he was gonna be looking good.
Speaker 1: And there's the two of 'em together, as they got ready, that they was checking each other out, making sure (laughter) they were looking presentable.  And that's their mom right there, yeah.  She's passed away now.  And then, and then some of the people who came by from the community, they watched them as they left out (laughter).  Yeah, so, so I, I just went--
Speaker 2: --this image, this image right here.  This--there was a revival taking place out at
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: There was a revival going on at [The Faith Community of] St. Sabina, and St. Sabina, of course, is not your normal Catholic church.  It's quite different (laughter).  Yeah, and if you go in there and close your eyes, you would think you was at a Baptist church, because even the pastor, Reverend [Michael L] Pfleger--
Speaker 1: If you close your eyes with Pfleger, you (unclear)--black reverend.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right (laughter), right, exactly.  And this guy here, he was the, he was the conductor of the revival.  He was the visiting minister.  He was--you know, they were having a revival, just like they do in the Pentecostal churches.  And you know, they let the spirit have its way up in there.  They--it's a very different place.  And so that was--and this mural is very famous.  Everybody around the world knows this mural.  And so--
Speaker 1: I've seen it in the [Chicago] Sun-Times about five times a year.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --Chicago [Illinois], this particular image here and right downtown.  Most people don't know where this is.  Yeah, it, it, it, it's, it's right there on the other side of One Illinois Center.  You know where the Sheraton Hotel is downtown?  Well, it's in that area.  Yeah, it's a big fountain there.  And if you don't go over there often, you wouldn't know where it was.
Speaker 2: That's a wild (unclear).
Speaker 1: And these kids were playing in that fountain.  I mean they were just, they were just--it was a hot night, and they were just running up and down this little stairs there.  They were running up and down these stairs on this fountain, and I just kept making photographs.  And I didn't know which one was gon' work.  It just so happened, this was one of the work horns, you know.  And it was, it was kind of at twilight, and the only light I had was the last light that was coming off the sky, and light--
Story_ID: 79373
Speaker 1: --is to have a photo history of how we were living, how we were faring at this point in time.  And so we've got photographs of, of everyday life within the black community.  And we're still growing the project; we're still working on it--and the images of Angela Spivey being ordained.  I even have photographs of her performing as a gospel artist--Von Freeman performing at the New Apartment Lounge.  Those are all part of that "Journey: The Next Hundred Years' project.  And the, the--we already have a 178 images that we have produced, as well as we had our opening show at the [Chicago] Museum of Contemporary Art at the, at the beginning of the new millennium.  I think in February of 2000 [sic, February 2001] we produced the first show.  And it's, and it's now, at this point, being moved around the Chicagoland area, and we hope to get it on the road and also produce a book as a result of that.  But Von Freeman and Angela Spivey is part of that, will be part of that historical record.  And we plan to leave a record at the Carter G. Woodson Library, as well as the Schomburg [Center for Research in Black Culture] in New York [New York City, New York].  And now days, you, you, you don't have to necessarily leave 'em prints.  You can leave 'em a CD.  You know, that's, that's the latest thing now.  It's easier and, and people can deal with that a lot easier if they wanna do some research and whatnot, so.  So that's, that's what, that's pretty much what I'm about right now, and I'm pretty much committed to that.
Speaker 2: In this book here, "The African Americans," I, I did a lot of, lot of that type of work.  And this was about a school up in Detroit [Michigan] that dealt with African-American male kids.  And there was a little controversy about it because its, it appeared as if girls were being ignored.  But at the time that this was made, almost ten years ago, there was a concern that young African-American males were going to fall through the cracks.  And there had to be a special educational need to try to bring them--keep them from falling through the cracks.  And so this school was developed up in, in [Washington] D.C.  It was part of the D.C. School System, and it was a kind of like an experiment.  And so I went up to document the program.  And this was one of the images that I--now this kid--they, they could find their own places to do their work.  And he found a spot on the floor in front of the classroom somewhere, just to himself.
Speaker 1: And let's see, let's see--was this the closing (unclear)?  Oh, where he we go.  And they-
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were, as you can see by the face of this young man, there was--it was all about business.  There was no--this was a place where they came to work, they came to study.  And it wasn't about, you know, playing.  And I think because there had been such a fuss being made about why not have the girls involved, they did have--they did bring in girls into the program, because they, you know, the need was felt that you can't just do this for the boys.  The girls need to understand that they have to be about the business of learning as well.  And so the whole school then opened up to, to the girls.  And so, and everybody was about the business of learning.  You didn't see a lot of horseplay in the, in the, in the hallways or anything.  And they all wore uniforms.  That was the other thing.  Everybody was in uniform, and they came in ready to go to work.  Yeah, and here they were going through learning the vowels.  And, and they would go up to the class--to the board--and they would actually sound it out, and point to each vowel as they, as they did it, and, and they would explain what it was all about to the rest of the class.  This was in Detroit.  I hope, I hope that school is still in operation, because it was--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I haven't heard of it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It's called Malcolm X School (unclear), from what I'm seeing.
Speaker 1: --community that was quest--that, that questioned whether or not the school was gonna take down the neighborhood, but it didn't (laughter), yeah.
Speaker 2: You wanna go to the next one?
Speaker 1: --yeah, it was--was it 400?  I think it was 400 speed film.  It's the shot up here at the top.  That one right there.
Speaker 2: Okay. Let me know when I'm (unclear) ready.
Speaker 1: This is a photograph of Lou Della Evans Reid.  She is the Minister of Music Emeritus of the Fellowship Missionary Baptist Church.  And for many, many, many years she was the minister of music there, where her brother was the founder and pastor, [HM] Reverend Clay Evans.  And if you ever wanted to see a person direct a church choir, and really hear the sound that came out as a result of her direction, it's an experience that you will never, never forget.  She's one of the most prolific and dynamic choir directors I've seen come along in many, many years.  And her influence has been greatly felt, because many of the young choir directors now that are coming along usually will pattern their conducting techniques after her.  I mean she can bring out, even in the person who can't hold a note, she can get it out 'em.  And then the sound that comes out collectively from the choir is almost like music from heaven.  I mean she's just--and just to watch her a she is able to pull these sounds, and total control, no, no score in front of her, but she, she directs from her heart.  And, and sometimes she, she get caught up too.  And, but yet she never loses control of that choir.  She knows where it's at at all times, and they, and they know where she's at at all times.  And, but she is a--it's an experience to behold as she conducts the choir at the--and now she's, she's retired, but every once in a while, she will get up and she will conduct a choir, even though she's supposed to be retired.  Just recently I made some photographs of her when she was having her retirement program.  And she was supposed to just come up and sit there and listen to the accolades as they were showered upon her.  But the minute she hit that platform, and the music was going, she just couldn't help herself.  She turned to that choir, and she began to conduct it.  And (laughter), and I was there to document this for the project I'm involved in, "Journey: The Next Hundred Years.  And I got some very memorable images during that time, and, and this is just one of 'em.  And she still has that same energy that you see here, you know, hasn't changed, not at all.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--like that?
Speaker 1: Yes, there are a few others.  I, I- I'll wait 'till you're ready. Or I'll wait 'till he's down here, I'll look down here in the monitor.
Speaker 2: Ok. Yeah, I, I try to find interesting ways to look at a situation so that you're not just looking at the picture, but you're being pulled into it.  So, oftentimes I try to find angles that kind of show points of view that you don't normally see or you just don't think about.  And so this was part--this was from a piece I did for the book, "The African Americans," on a family in Detroit that were homeschooling their, their kids.  And so I spent time with them as they went to the store, as they sat around the table and did their school work.  And they're also Moslem, and, and so, well, they did their evening prayers and everything.  But this was one of the images that kind of, that the editors really liked a lot, because this was the dad and, and one of the sons as they played a game of chess.  And what was so interesting about this particular family was, these were not natural children to the two adults.  They had already raised their children.  They already had their family, and their family was grown and gone on, but they kind of wanted to still be involved in the parenting process.  And the wife saw a program about adopting kids, even kids that were already older, which is very much of a challenge.  You know, you can get kids that are young, and you can mold them and whatnot, but these kids were already pretty much on their way.  So they adopted these brothers.  They were brothers, and so rather than have 'em be split up in, you know, going to different places, they took them in, and were raising them and sending them and teaching them, you know.  And so, this, that's what this piece was all about.  And this was kind of like one of the signature pieces within that (unclear)--within that group.  And I was struck by the fact that, here they were, sitting over this table that had a mirror top to it, and had been pretty much worn.  You could see around the edges it was worn, but you could see their faces in there as they concentrated on the game.  So I found a little stepstool that I could get up on, and I could actually look down and see them from the top, and kind of get a sense of, of what they were doing.  And 'course my big challenge was to make sure I didn't get my own reflection in there (laughter), and then not fall over on the table (laughter).
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  Laughter (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: Right, right, but I, but I wanted to get a point of view that was, that was just different, and, and therefore would make it interesting to look at.
