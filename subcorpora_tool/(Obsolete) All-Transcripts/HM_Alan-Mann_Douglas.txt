Speaker 1: What you have here is back in the day what they would call a composite.  And it was to show various and different looks that you could have that show your versatility.  I guess the most significant thing about this particular composite, and this was my first one by the way, down in the lower left hand corner the, the little small gentleman there that I'm feeding, that's my son.  He's a lot bigger now.
Speaker 2: And what year was this?
Speaker 1: That had be like 1975 maybe, '76 [1976]. That was a play called "The Daubers" (ph.), and I played an Italian gangster in that; notice the, the slick hair.  And one of those, again, one of those shots that show that I was commercial.  The way we were.
Speaker 2: Well doesn't that picture say it all?  Well this was--obviously it was a modeling job and it was in "Ebony" Magazine in 1978 and that was just the photo to accompany that particular article.  I don't think I had any more appeal, and it sure didn't work for me at the time.  So--
Speaker 1: That was a play that I did with the Experimental Black Actors' Guild.  And I played a very troubled son who had come home to borrow some money from his mother.  The name of the play was "Where Is The Pride And What Is The Joy?"
Speaker 2: Where was that?
Speaker 1: That was at the Experimental Black Actors' Guild on the South Side of Chicago.  It's a company on which I cut my teeth on as an actor.
Speaker 2: Again this was another play that was done at the Experimental Black Actors' Guild, affectionately known as X-BAG.  And the name of this particular production was "Warn The Wicked".  What's significant about this piece and the, the third photograph, yeah, that gentleman right there on the left, that's Robert Townsend.  And that's where he also cut his teeth in theater was at X-BAG.
Speaker 1: Yeah, those are other photographs of the production.  Hair was big back in those days.  And oddly enough, those hairstyles are once again in vogue.
Speaker 2: And when was this?
Speaker 1: That had to be 1977, '76 [1976], '77 [1977], somewhere around there.  I know it was the first play I ever directed, again, with the Experimental Black Actors' Guild.
Speaker 2: One of my first head shots.  That had to be 1971, around that period.
Speaker 1: The occasion?
Speaker 2: Was that the Jeff Award [Joseph Jefferson Award]?  No, no, no that wasn't the Jeff Award, the Jeff Award is something else that I have and you have to scan that, it's a newspaper thing.  But that was just another one--the many plays in my illustrious career.  And it was just the review and a picture from that.  The name of the play obviously was "The Silence".

Speaker 1: Okay, and what is your favorite season of the year?
Speaker 2: It'd have to be summer here in Chicago [Illinois].  There's no other place like it.
Story_ID: 74797
Speaker 1: What sights and sounds and smells remind you of your childhood?
Speaker 2: I guess fresh grass, lemonade, snow, people ice skating, those kind of things.
Speaker 1: Okay, let's take fresh grass.  Why is that significant?
Speaker 2: We grew up near Washington Park.  And just out there playing football as a kid and just smelling the aroma of the fresh--you know you've been inside all summer.  Well we weren't inside all summer because we went ice skating.  There was a playground across the street and we would--they would freeze it and we would skate.  So when the seasons changed into spring and summer, going outside and playing football and tackling and wrestling, and the grass was just one of those things that kind of stuck with me.
Speaker 1: In--back in the day when they used to cut it and you could smell it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's a big park.
Speaker 1: You say snow.  And in Chicago [Illinois] that's--brings a--means a lot to everybody.  Why does snow stick?
Speaker 2: Well, snow has always been a big part of Chicago winters and as a kid I grew up here, like I said.  And we used--we would be outside all the time, you know, I, I can remember one particular winter back in 1967 I think it was, we had the big snow in Chicago.  You know, it was drifting and the drifts were twelve feet high and all the streets were closed off and that particular winter my father [Donald Mann] showed us the, the kids how to make igloos.  We took a shoebox and we put snow in it and impacted it in and we just built these bricks on top of it and covered it with water and they became very solid, they froze.  But we could go inside the igloos and a little hole in them--it was quite comfortable in there.
Speaker 1: That's good.  You talk about lemonade, so we move from snow to summer time.  Why does lemonade stick out?
Speaker 2: It was just one--I had a--always had a bit of a sweet drink tooth.  And I can remember my father teaching me to make lemonade at a very young age, and just the freshness of the lemons and everything has always stuck with me.  And it's something I still make to this day.
Story_ID: 74798
Speaker 1: Okay, let's go back to grandparents.  Which one of your grandparents was your favorite?
Speaker 2: My grandmother, without a doubt, Vivian, Vivian McPhan.
Speaker 1: And why was that?
Speaker 2: She loved me, she loved me, she loved me, and she just loved me.  Grew up on 49th Street between Prairie and Calumet here in Chicago [Illinois].  And she lived around the corner at 4907 South Prairie.  So I was never more than a hop, skip and a jump away from her.  And out of her--off her back porch was this playground, Harding Playground that I, that I mentioned before.  So she could come out and she could call me--and I don't care--and the, the, the 'L' train went down the alley there, so it was always the noise and the roaring of the 'L'.  But she had a way of calling me.  And her voice would cut through any noise, and I don't care where I was in the playground, she could all--I could always turn around and look and see her standing on the porch there and she would be calling me "Doug, Doug", and maybe not any louder than that.  But it would cut through everything, and I would turn around and see her and everything, and she would beckon me.  And she'd say you know, go to the store for me and get me some milk or some bread or something like that.  And she always had a quarter for me, she always had a present for me.  And she just, she just loved me, she just loved me.  She took care of me.  I was, I was her heart.  My other cousins often say to this day that I was her favorite, that she always did more for me than she did for anybody else.
Speaker 1: Is she still living?
Speaker 2: No.  No, she died in 1978.
Speaker 1: And how old were you when you--when she died?
Speaker 2: When she died?  I was an adult.  Twenty-four, 25 years old.
Speaker 1: What did--what kind of things happened within you when your grandmother died?
Speaker 2: A sense of tremendous loss.  Had people died in the family before that, but never anyone that I had the kind of connection that I had with her, the kind of relationship that I had with her.  I mean she really nurtured me and it was, it was a tremendous blow and it was a tremendous hurt.  It was the first time I'd ever, ever felt that, you know that somebody that I loved so much and that loved me so much that I was never gonna see them again.  I was never going to be able to touch her again, I was never going to be able to talk to her again, or have her get on my case about something that I had done.  And all that wisdom and everything that she had instilled me and everything, it was just--it was just inside of me at that point.  It was nothing that I could really reach out and grab it anymore.  I mean it hurt, it hurt terribly.
Speaker 1: What experience comes to mind that most illustrates the relationship you had with your grandmother?  What experience did you share with your grandmother?
Speaker 2: There's so many, it'd be kind of difficult to choose from.  But I guess more so than anything else, my grandmother--she knew people.  One of the reasons that she knew people and it kind of plays into my whole--everything that I have--that, that has to do with theater.  'Cause theater, you know, you have to create a character and you have to pretend that you're someone else.  And my grandmother would always tell me these stories about people, people will do this, people will say this; be careful because people will try to trick you.  And one of the reasons for that is that she always had somebody living in her house.  She had roomers is what they called them back then.  And would always be playing--this kid would look up at the second floor and she would have that little sign in her window, "Room for Rent".  And she always had somebody else living in her house outside of family.  And so I guess she got to know all these different characters over all these many years about people.  So I heard these stories until I was sick about it.  But when she passed and then growing as an adult and getting out here, those words just echoed, and she kind of like sits here on my shoulder as I, as I go through life now.  You know, remember this--be careful, be aware--that's what she was talking about.  That's the kind of person that she had described to me before.  So I still carry a lot of those and I think that's probably the most significant aspect of our relationship that I still hold onto today.
Speaker 1: What about--that was your--that's your maternal [sic, paternal] grandmother.
Speaker 2: Right, that's my father's mother.
Speaker 1: Your father, your paternal.  What kind of relationship did you have with your paternal grandfather [Houston Mann]?
Speaker 2: Never knew him.  She married a man called--his name was Robert McPhan, which is the last name that she took.  And for all intents and purposes, he was my, my grandfather.  But he was not of blood.  But he was a very good man; he worked hard and my grandmother that I knew of, she never worked a day, you know she was home and she was a homemaker and she took care of him.  And she took care of the grandchildren.
Story_ID: 74799
Speaker 1: Tell me something about your growing up in the Mann household.
Speaker 2: My father [Donald Mann] was a very strict disciplinarian, and I'm thankful for that.  In a business as unforgiving as this one is, it's good to have your head screwed on straight and to have a good value system.  So I couldn't get away with anything.  My mother [Malinda Mann] by contrast, was a very loving and giving person.  And after some years of working, my father decided that he didn't want my mother to work anymore; he wanted her to stay home and raise the children.  He--it was his contention that women going out into the working world and everything like that was only going to kick one butt in this family, and that was his.  And if he had to work three jobs in order for that to happen, then that's what he would do.  Full of a lot of surprises, a lot of gifts.  And when I say gifts, I mean things that I still carry around with me to this day.  My father taught me a lot of things, and they served me well later on in life.  I can remember he taught me how to play chess at a very young age.  And we lived in Chicago [Illinois] until 1967, and then we moved to Michigan, a little small town.  I'm going--16, 17 years old and I'm being--growing into my manhood, plucked from the streets of Chicago and stuck up here in this country.
Speaker 1: What city?
Speaker 2: In Bangor, Michigan with these bumpkins and these, you know, countrified people.  And I was kind of lost.  The school that I was attending there was majority white.  And I found myself sitting in class and I got kind of like culture shock.  I mean I knew white people existed before that time, but I never had them surround me in, in the manner that they were surrounding me then.  My education in Chicago--I was probably a typical young African American male.  Didn't too much care about my education or where I was going, so I find myself in a classroom full of very bright individuals.  Had an effect on me, you know, and a negative effect because I'm like whoa, I'm so behind in math, I'm so behind in history.  How am I going to keep up?  But this simple thing, this simple game of chess allowed me to find my place and to find my own stand that I could, I could call out from, or gave me a measure of being.  Walking through the hallway and they said Chess Club meets tomorrow at so-and-so.  I'm like, I got 'em now, you know.  But it gave me a sense of, a sense of self.  There was something that I could do that nobody else could do.  And so from that, I began to build you know, more self-esteem and you know, began to study harder, and began to take everything a, a little bit more seriously because it gave me a badge; it gave me something that I could wear; it gave me something that I could do that nobody else could touch me in.
Speaker 1: Sisters and brothers?
Speaker 2: One sister [Ursula Mann], and I'm eleven years older than she is.  So there's that generation gap.  Although we're very close today.  But by the time I graduate from high school, she was just in third grade and I was gone.
Speaker 1: What was your relationship like with your mom?
Speaker 2: Again, my mom was very nurturing.  She's a--she was a pretty quiet woman.  She didn't say a lot, but she was very, very feminine.  She was very--she measured her words, you know she wasn't boisterous, she was more cuddling and coddling.  And the only time that she could real--you know I kind, I kind of had my way with my mother to an extent and I could do things that you know, I wasn't, wasn't going to be able to get away with my father.  But boy, she could snap me back into place by saying, you know, "don't have me tell your daddy".  And that was the thing, okay time to straighten up and fly right.  So--but that's the kind of woman that she was.
Story_ID: 74800
Speaker 1: What did you like most about growing up in your Chicago [Illinois] years, and then what did you like most about your Bangor years [Illinois]?  How long were you in Bangor?
Speaker 2: Just three years.  My sophomore through senior year of high school, from 1967.
Speaker 1: Where--I'm sorry.  Why did you go to Bangor?
Speaker 2: Why did I go to Bangor?  I had no choice in the matter.
Speaker 1: I mean why did your father [Donald Mann]--
Speaker 2: Well I don't know if he'd really want me to tell the truth about that story.  How can I put this?  I'll put it like this.  He was tired of Chicago.  He had grown up here all his life.  He'd had some problems here, and he decided that he would just get his family away from the city.  At the time, I wanted to stay with my grandmother [Vivian McPhan], but he was having none of that.  He's like no, we're all moving as a family to Michigan.  What did I like about Chicago?  I mean everything.  You know you've seen all the coming of age movies, you know young fellas on the street.  Like I said, the big snow storm, we was out running around doing things.  We used to hop the 'L' to go downtown and goof on people.  You know just a regular, mischievous childhood, boyhood.  We weren't--I certainly wasn't, not with my father, wasn't a bad kid.  I wasn't a delinquent child, but I was mischievous and we would get into things.  But again things like ice skating during the winter, being at the playground, playing Run, Chief, Run, or running on legs that never got tired all summer long.  Those kind of boyhood memories.  When I was a little older and very upset when we moved to Bangor 'cause they plucked me from all my friends and I thought that I was gonna miss that.  But going to Bangor, it probably was one of the best things that ever happened to me in the sense that I was away from the streets of Chicago.  And when I look back on, on these days, I see a lot of my friends that didn't make it.  And so I was able--I mean as early as my sophomore year, one of my friends committed suicide down here.  And he was a very close friend.  I mean he was the kind of fellow that you know, when you saw me turn a corner, you saw him turn a corner.  Had some very deep psychological problems that stemmed from his family life.  Him seeing that his mother was killed by his father and a lot of things like that weighed heavy on him.  But that being aside, a lot of my other friends just went different directions.  You know, wound up in jail and gangs and shot up on the street and drugs.  And so it was--it enabled me to kind of like stand back away from Chicago and take a look at it.  Now I didn't know I was doing this at the time; this is some years after I discovered that.  But Bangor provided a lot of highlights for me as well.  Number one, it was the place where I discovered theater.  Friend of mine was doing a play, school play, and he said well come and see me in the play, come and see me in the play.  Yeah, okay, whatever, you know.  So I go to see him in the play and as I'm sitting there, I have this epiphany and I'm like, I could do that.  That's what I've been doing all my life is play acting.  You mean there's actually a industry, or there's actually an occupation that you can do?  Now of course my father didn't agree with it.  But from that point on, I auditioned for the school plays and was very good at 'em and you know once you hear that applause, it's all over for you, really.  And so I did all the school plays there.  They would let me write and host the talent shows and so I got that kind of exposure and at that point I decided I wanted to be an actor.
Speaker 1: And you were in Bangor from 1967 to--
Speaker 2: To 1970.
Story_ID: 74801
Speaker 1: Let's go and back to school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: First grade through eighth grade.  Who were your favorite teachers?  Most memorable experiences from that period.
Speaker 2: Maybe Mrs. Lewis at Farren High School [sic, Farren Elementary School].  Maybe Mrs. Lewis from about maybe fourth or fifth grade, I think Mrs. Lewis.  And she played the piano.  And we used to sing.  And I guess maybe something started in me way back then; she was able to do something.  She was able to do something creatively I thought.  If we move on up, it would have to be Clarence Taylor, that would have been in eighth grade.  He was my art teacher.  And he was a lot like my father [Donald], which I think it was all connection.  Because he was a guy that didn't take any, any kind of stuff off of anybody, you know.  And he was a disciplinarian.  And if you got out of line and everything, he would really--and so I think from that standpoint he really stood out as an individual to me.  And I respected him and I wanted to gain his respect.  And in order to do that, you had to really kind of like walk the straight and narrow.  And I think the other, other part of it is that I knew that if I could get away with anything with him, then I had the whole world fooled, you know.  So I think that that's a small part of it also.  But--and the irony of that situation is that when I got involved in theater in Chicago [Illinois] and I heard about this theater company, and I said I'm gonna go over there and I'm gonna audition.  When I walked through the doors, who is the first person that I seen?  Clarence Taylor.  And he was the founder of that theater company.
Story_ID: 74802
Speaker 1: Okay, just for our records, can name your grammar school and high school?
Speaker 2: I went to [John] Farren Elementary School [Chicago, Illinois] from kindergarten to about fifth grade, and then something happened with the zoning and they built a school right across the street from me on 49th Street, Overton [Elementary] School [Chicago, Illinois].  I went there until the end of sixth grade, and then I went to Vincennes Upper Grade Center [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, would you spell Farren for us?
Speaker 2: F-A-R-R-E-N, that's John Farren School.
Speaker 1: And Vincennes, you went to two high schools.
Speaker 2: No, no, Vincennes was a seventh and eighth grade school, an upper grade center is what they call.  So I went to Overton until sixth grade.  And then seventh and eighth grade was Vincennes Upper Grade Center.  It's now--it was in Washington Park, it was right across the street from Provident Hospital.  It's called Walter [H.] Dyett School, now it's in the park, over in Washington Park.
Speaker 1: And it used to be Vincennes.
Speaker 2: Well when it was across the street, the old building, which I think was an old folks' home or something at one time.  And that was converted into a, a school.
Story_ID: 74803
Speaker 1: Do you remember your first day of school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: What is the first school experience you remember?
Speaker 2: My first school experience that I remember.  That's something I have to--have to think about.  My first school experience that I remember.  I don't--I--I was one of those people, I wanted to get school out, I wanted to get away from school, I wanted to get out of school.  So I guess even these many years later and everything, I was like okay.  Even when I was in high school, like well you're gonna go to college?  I don't think so.  I wanted to get out and get a job; I wanted to work and make money and be on my own and be out of my father's [Donald Mann] house and stand on my own two feet.  So if that meant going to school and staying, no, I--so I don't really, I don't really remember not too much about my first experience at school.
Speaker 1: You remember high school prom, graduation?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah that I do remember, that I do remember.  Of course that was in, in Michigan at the time.
Speaker 1: What was that like?
Speaker 2: Again, it was one of those situations whereas during the programs or whatever like that, they wanted me to emcee.  And so there were things that you know, the student body had written up about--old funny stories that we told about the different classmates and that kind of thing.  My girlfriend, my grandmother getting me a tuxedo to wear to the prom.  The, the--staying out all night after that and running here, going there, you know.  More, you know--and I was closer to graduation and I knew that when I graduated, I was out of Bangor [Michigan] and I was back to Chicago [Illinois].  So those kind of things.  Again, it was school, I wanted something--I just wanted to get behind me.  So the prom played a significant role, a small role in, in that.  But again, I just wanted to get school behind me.
Story_ID: 74804
Speaker 1: What was the transition back to the city [Chicago, Illinois] like?
Speaker 2: I couldn't wait.  It was, it was one great big party is what it was.  It's like I'm back.  And it was just about having fun and it was about trying to get my career going.
Speaker 1: What steps did you take?
Speaker 2: I guess the first thing that we were trying to do was trying to get involved in a play--was trying to get involved in some kind of theater ,because at that particular time, that's what my knowledge was.  Sort of naive, I thought if I got into a play, somebody was going to discover me and I would be whisked away and off to Hollywood.  So there were several auditions around and we did--we got involved--we--talk about a friend of mine also that--his name was Michael Forenoy [ph.].  He, he and I, we were going to be actors and we were going to be the best actors ever.  So we went to audition for one play and we rehearsed it for a while and for whatever reason the play just never got produced; never saw the light of day.  A little disheartened by that, but we kept on looking.  And then one morning looking in the paper, they were holding auditions for actors at the Experimental Black Actors Guild, affectionately known as X-BAG, with the founder, Clarence Taylor was there.  We went to audition and we got the part.  And that was our beginning.  And audiences began to discover us.  And year after year, you know we were doing play after play after play after play after play.  And it was--we were just developing our craft.  And that was a lot of fun.
Story_ID: 74805
Speaker 1: At what point did you actually consider yourself a professional actor?
Speaker 2: My first paycheck--first time I got paid for, for acting.  And I was like, I'm on my way.
Speaker 1: What play and what period was that in?
Speaker 2: That was in the, in the middle '70s [1970s].  What play was it?  I can't remember what play it was.  I don't remember what play it was.
Speaker 1: Was it for the experimental theater?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right it was for the Experimental Black Actors--no, it wasn't for the Experimental Black Actors Guild.  It was--then it had to be later.  It was for a group on the north side, I think it was Victory Gardens Theater.  I was--started out as understudy in, in this particular play.  What was the name of that play?  It escapes me right now.  But I went on in the performance and I got a check and I'm like, I'm a professional now.  I was able to go and get my cards, my union cards.  But I think even before the plays, I think it was voiceover work that I, that I--no, no, no, no, no.  I know exactly what it was now, I remember.  Auditioned for a commercial.  And got the commercial, and it was on television.  It was the Illinois Bell Telephone [Company] man.  And the commercial was like the guy walks up to the door and they were trying to say don't just let anybody in your house.  And so it's the Illinois Bell Telephone man.  You know I always carry my ID, blah, blah, blah, blah.  I walk up to a, a house and ring the woman's doorbell.  And she says "oh, do you have your ID?"  And I'm like "Yes, ma'am".  And the commercial ran forever, it ran often.  I think "Roots" was just coming on TV and they played it on "Roots", so everybody saw this thing and I was like a mini celebrity and I was getting residual checks were coming in.  And that's probably when I first said okay, I can do this and I can make a living at it.
Speaker 1: Do you still have a copy of that?
Speaker 2: I do, I do.  It's on--well you know we're going back a little bit, so it's not on videotape or anything, it's on a reel-to-reel, you know, so one of those kind of things.  So if you got an old machine someplace, you could fire it up and we'd all get a lot of laughs out of that.
Story_ID: 74806
Speaker 1: So from your commercial and to Victory Gardens [Theater], doing the off-Loop theater and so on, trace your career, you know, when you're moving into more into being a full-fledged pro.
Speaker 2: After Victory Gardens, we're really thinking that now we're gonna really do our north, north side thing.  This is way before what they call now cross-cultural casting, color blind casting.  The north side had an interest of maybe doing one show with African American content at that particular time.  So we'd all clamor for those one or two jobs.  Really didn't find that satisfying.  And so we decided to create our own venue.  So in 1984 we formed the Chicago Theater Company.  And we were kind of naive because we just get up on stage and we'll just act and do what it is.  But Clarence Taylor taught me is that the play is just the tip of the iceberg.  If you look below the surface, there's this whole massive structure that supports that tip.  So we got into learning the business of, of theater.  When we opened our first show in 1984, I mean we, we were huge, we were big, we were the upstarts, we were, you know, people liked what we were doing.  And so we continued on doing that.  I was also getting a lot of voiceover work at that particular time.  And when I started getting those residual checks in from the voiceover, I had to step back.  I was going out for movies and I did a couple of films.  But again at that time, my skin color and for whatever reason, different things, they were more stereotyping.  They wanted the African American that looked like the African American.  Things are different now, but not during those times.  So I didn't get a lot of that kind of work that I just didn't fit the--and film is all about looks and that sort of thing.  So I didn't get a lot of that work.  But because of my voice, people kind of stood up and took notice and someone had said to me standing in the theater at X-BAG during the time.  Said man, you've got a real good voice; you should do voiceovers.  All my life people have told me about my voice.  Like I said if you can believe it, I had this voice since I was five years old.  My mother [Matilda Mann] says my first words were "I don't want them grits."  So--and people from the flower shop and all through school and even in high school in Bangor, Michigan, they would tell me about my voice; you got a nice voice.  You got a good voice, you got a good voice.  And a guy says man, you should be doing voiceovers.  And I'm like voiceovers, what is that?  He said that's where, you know, those people on the radio, you hear them do the commercials and everything.  You can do that.  I could?  Well how do you do that?  And so he explained to me about putting a tape together and going out to meet the agents.  Remember before I said I thought that you're on stage here, where are these people and they're taking their own sweet time about discovering me, you know.  So I put that together and I began to get out there and I really began to push those voiceover demos.  And things just begun to happen.  So I was really earning a very decent living doing voiceover work, and then spending my evenings developing the Chicago Theater Company.  So we just kept on and, you know we just--we've been around twenty years now.

Speaker 1: The size of the theater [Chicago Theater Company], how many dedicated acting workers do you have in your theater end-to-end? From beginning and today?
Speaker 2: From beginning?
Speaker 1: I mean when you started, how many did you start with?
Speaker 2: There were four of us that founded the theater company.  A couple of guys have passed since that time, and then there's Chuck Smith who works at the Goodman [Theatre].  He's (unclear) associate over there.  And then there's just me at the theater currently.  We had staff of maybe three people at the particular time.  We have a staff of maybe about seven or eight now.
Speaker 1: So how do you keep up with the management of it and the--just--
Speaker 2: Well we have a Managing Director, and he has an assistant.  My staff includes my designer, Set Designer, Light Designer, Sound Designer, Costume Designer, Stage Manager, our Stage Manager and the like.  And so I also have an Associate Artistic Director who helps me in selection of plays and finding work for me to do.  So we manage.
Speaker 1: How many plays do you run per season?
Speaker 2: Three.  Our season runs from September to June.  And in that time we have about three shows.
Speaker 1: And as Artistic Director, what kind of feeling--do you open up the year knowing, okay, this year I'm going this direction.  How do you arrive at that?
Speaker 2: It's hard to say.  We get a lot of different works in--solicited and unsolicited.  Sometimes there is a running thread through some of the work that I read.  Sometimes there isn't.  I try to choose work that's--pushes the envelope a little bit, if you will.  That's not on the beaten path.  That has more interesting, risky kind of story.  I often like to say is that when you come to see our work, you're not exactly what--you're not exactly sure what you're gonna see.  It could be absurdist, it could be comedy, it could be drama.  It could be something like you've never, ever seen before and I tend to go that way in, in choosing the kind of work that I do.  So I'm trying not to get caught up in well this year we're gonna do the--we're gonna work on this particular theme or that particular theme.  Playwrights number one write about what they want to write about, so if it's something that I read and I have some kind of simpatico with, then I'll try to go that direction.  But then the very next show it may be something completely different than what you saw the time before.
Speaker 1: What is the most challenging thing you run into as a director?
Speaker 2: There are many challenges, actually.  Keeping the work fresh, keeping the work interesting.  Making sure that it is the highest of quality.  Making sure that it is entertaining, and that it's something that audiences really leave there with some sort of feeling, whether they're sad or whether they're exuberant or whether they've been touched in some kind of way.  But just making sure that it's always the--like buying a--the freshest produce that you can have.  You know it's--you find an apple and you bite into it and it's just as succulent, and it just makes you feel good inside.  That's the kind of theater that--and it's challenging to do that show after show after show.  It's almost like you're having to top yourself, and that can be very difficult sometimes; finding the right material, the kind of material that I like and the kind of material that we're known for to push it out there.
Story_ID: 74808
Speaker 1: How do you get feedback, other than ticket sales?  How do you get the intangible feedback?  What does an audience, a theatergoer, how do they get to you as to whether--how they like it or dislike whatever you're doing in any given season?
Speaker 2: Like you say number one is ticket sales.  I mean that'll let you know right there--they didn't go for that one so well.  But we've done market studies before and, and people just--you--the amount of people that come up to you and say to you, you know, saw that, that was brilliant; keep up the good work; we like it; we like what you do.  And so it's that kind of feedback.  Other than that, paper is just that, just paper.  Because we may find audiences are different.  One play might appeal to a certain segment, and the next play may not appeal to that segment at all.  So it's always getting newer people into our seats and people that never have been to see any of our work before.  And that's how--that helps us to grow in terms of the kind of work that we do.
Speaker 1: You've had some very good reviews over, over the years.  I've noticed them in the papers.  But how, how do you feel as a director, but also as an actor, how do you feel about critics and their responses?
Speaker 2: It's one person's opinion.  I mean I can't state it anymore simply than that.  I learned a long time ago, one of the lessons that I learned from Clarence Taylor is that put that stuff out your head.  I mean they're gonna like it based on what their experience is, and if you really begin to believe your own press clippings, then you're not going to ever be any better as an artist than you are right now because you'll think that you're good.  And if you're gonna believe the good ones, then you'd better be prepared to believe the bad ones as well.  So just kind of, you know and I have to wear a couple of different hats in that sense that good reviews help box office and builds morale with the staff at the theater and board members can get excited.  And so I have to wear that hat, it's like the, reviews, the reviews, the reviews.  But personally I take it all with a grain of salt.
Speaker 1: Word-of-mouth.  You've done, done very well with word-of-mouth in building over the years.  Have you done any other formal marketing?
Speaker 2: We've just never had the budget to do the formal marketing thing.  And always in theater, word-of-mouth is what sells tickets.  I mean you've seen many full page ads for productions and the word-of-mouth is--don't waste your time.  But when people go out and they talk about what you do, that's worth more than a million dollars because Monday morning around the coffee urn--well what did you do this weekend?  I saw this play--you've got to go see this.  And that's what makes our telephone ring.  In the future we do plan on doing a little bit more marketing, but I like the word-of-mouth aspect.  Initially, you know, the PR [public relations] person--get the word out, they get the listings and that kind of thing.  But okay so the critics don't like it, but the people do.  Which would you rather have?  Which would you rather have?
Story_ID: 74809
Speaker 1: Over the two decades or so you've been with and running Chicago Theater--
Speaker 2: Company.
Speaker 1: Can you tell me your three favorite pieces and why?
Speaker 2: My three favorite pieces and why.  Number one would have to be a piece we did called "Mr. Rickey Calls a Meeting".  And the reason that that is significant for me because I directed that show.  And usually the director's job after the show is over and the director is gone.  You turn it over to the stage manager and that kind of thing.  And I was, I was gone.  Maybe four weeks into the run, I come down and I sit and I'm watching the show and I got totally engrossed in it.  I mean I had forgotten that I had directed the show.  The piece was about Branch Rickey bringing Jackie Robinson into the major leagues.  And as I was sitting on the back row totally engrossed in the play, I began to well up inside, you know, listening to and watching the performers.  And I was holding it back.  And somebody who was sitting on the same row, maybe about six or seven seats down, I heard them sniffle.  And they started to cry.  And then at that point when they--it was all right for me to do it.  But I lost myself in my own production, and it was a very weird feeling.  So that was one of the most significant things that I've, you know done.  For me we did a piece that was based on a book called "Billy".  And "Billy" was about a nine-year-old that accidentally kills a white girl in the South.  They tried this young man, they sentenced him to the electric, to the electric chair, and they electrocute him.  Very dark story.  But it had two young people that played the roles of friends, nine and ten-years-old.  And in helping of their development as young actors, it was just amazing to me that they were holding their own on stage with people that had twenty, thirty years more experience than they did.  And that really touched me inside, is helping to see them grow that much at such a, such a young age.  Another piece that probably was "Ceremonies in Dark Old Men" with the Experimental Black Actors Guild, going back my first experience on stage with X-BAG.  And that was--it was my first full-fledged outing as an actor and audiences were coming to see the play and they were responding to what we did on stage, and then again that word-of-mouth was out there.  And as a result of that, my name was getting out there as this new, young, bright thespian.  I was just loving it at the time, you know.  So those are probably my--probably top three for me.
Story_ID: 74810
Speaker 1: What do you see for the [Chicago] Theater Company in the near future and long term?
Speaker 2: We still must remain to be bursting.  Those seats need to be filled for every production, every night of performance.  Strengthening our board, strengthening our financial resources, those are all short term goals.  And in the long term, another space possibly, another space.
Speaker 1: How has this space worked for you?
Speaker 2: It's been nothing but magic.  It's nothing but magic.  I often that hear people say we gotta get out of here.  But that space has provided so much magic for me that when the time comes for us to move, I think we'll always hold onto that space, you know for maybe smaller, experimental kind of things, developmental kind of things.  But I'd still like to have control of that space.  It's, it's been wonderful to us.
Speaker 1: What is the seating capacity?
Speaker 2: If I just jam pack people in there and nobody calls the authorities, I can get about 117 people in there.
Speaker 1: And you usually have how many performances?
Speaker 2: Three performances a week.
Speaker 1: Three per--
Speaker 2: Yes, three performances a week, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  And in the future, those may increase as well.
Speaker 1: Which ones are the most popular?
Speaker 2: Hard to say.  Last several shows we've been just about selling out everything, you know, on all nights.  So it's kind of hard to say, kind of hard to say.  I would--if I was pressed for an answer, I'd probably say Saturday.
Speaker 1: If I were a fairy godmother and I could grant you one wish for the theater, what would it be?
Speaker 2: Just one wish?  For its prosperity and for its longevity.
Speaker 1: And if I granted two wishes for yourself, what would that be?
Speaker 2: Health and I don't know, hitting the lottery wouldn't be a bad thing necessarily, but I'd have to play first.
Story_ID: 74811
Speaker 1: What about professional training and continuing education?  What have you done in that area?
Speaker 2: As far as myself is concerned, nothing really.  I'm busy with my head in the sand--my head in Chicago Theater Company with its development.  So usually when I get a break or take a break, it's off to Jamaica.  So--and so that's my education, is to be able to just breathe a little bit.
Speaker 1: Okay, we got just about a minute left on this tape.  Can you tell me what would you say to young actors coming up today?
Speaker 2: That this is a business.  They call it show business, it's not show art.  So as talented as you may be, make sure that you're taking care of the business side of it.  Talented as you may be, it's important to be on time, be prepared, be courteous because realize that this is a privilege.  There's a long line of people out there that wanna be actors.  And if you're fortunate enough to find yourself in a production, protect that, you know.  You as a, as a person, as a human being, make sure that your life is in order.  I mean the business is not going anywhere.  Seen so many people just give up everything to try to do a play and then a month later, you know, they can't pay their telephone bill or they can't pay their rent or they find themselves out on the street trying to room with somebody, or find themselves getting into all other kind of nefarious activities in order to pursue this dream.  This business is not going anywhere; it's been around a long time.  Get your life in order.  You know you--and then you can think in terms of having some longevity because this is a very cruel and unforgiving business sometimes.  And you just need to take care of it a little bit more, and yourself.
Story_ID: 74533
Speaker 1: What is your opinion of theater and film today from the actor's standpoint?
Speaker 2: I think in theater when you--the opportunity presents itself with the handful of plays that come out by African American authors, it provides you with more meat to work on your craft.  I don't see that in films so much today.  I think they're still--films are still, films are still coming from a stereotypical standpoint, and understandably because they're trying to do box office.  So it's junk food for the masses.  You know you've got to have something to put into those thirty-two screen theaters.  It's got to be something up there, so I think the product is often rushed, not thought out and I think that it's not about art anymore.  I think that it's more about box office and who's number one.  And I think that that's just--well it's just Hollywood.  That's the industry, and that's fine.  They wanna go in that direction.  I think theater is more challenging.  I think theater represents and presents more lifelike characterizations of, of a lifestyle, if you will, of a particular subject matter.  So that's just the way that, that I lean, is more towards theater.
Story_ID: 74534
Speaker 1: Well you've seen many changes in theater and in life generally, certainly the two or three decades you've been into acting professionally and certainly your school years.  From an African American standpoint, do you feel like it's really better or is it just looks like it's better today for African American actors?
Speaker 2: I think it looks like it's better.  I think that there are--there's more work certainly today than when I first started out.  We were scrambling just trying, trying to work.  There are many more theaters, there are many more films.  But I, I don't know if anything has changed.  One of the things that I've, I've noticed particularly in films, is that back during the '70s [1970s] they had what they called blaxploitation.  Now that was the European producers producing these works that about, you know and they, you know, they're based around pimp lifestyles or hustling lifestyles.  And there maybe were a few breakthrough films during that time, maybe "Sounder" is one that comes to mind where they showed us just as human beings and we were able to portray our humanity.  But now that, that the film has come into a new generation and you find young African Americans behind the cameras writing the works, it's interesting that they portray those same kind of stereotypes.  And you--we would have thought that maybe they were going for a little bit more positive lean to the, to the kind of work.  So what's the old saying?  "The more things change, the more they stay the same".
Speaker 1: They are--they do have some breakthroughs, i.e., "Soul Food", "Drumline".
Speaker 2: As they did in the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Those--they do have many more coming up faster reflections of true-to-life African American life today.  What do you think about that?
Speaker 2: They're hard to find.  They're hard to find.  I'm glad that they're doing it and I wish that they would do more of it.  But again, I think Hollywood is about the bottom line.  I mean even the major films that come out today, if they open at number one, they fade very quickly.  So there's this sense that when an African American film comes out, you know they wanna get everybody into the theaters as early and quickly as possible.  And then the film kind of like fades from, from view.  I guess with the advent of video, it might find another audience on video that you might--wow, this was a good film.  You know, this was, this was great; I enjoyed that.  But they're far and few between.
Speaker 1: What do you think will change?
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: What do you think will change that whole--
Speaker 2: You're not gonna change Hollywood that I know of.  I, I think independent cinema is--have to go in to change that.  But with independent cinema, that means you're not gonna get necessarily studio dollars, so where are those dollars gonna come from?  I think that we as a people, African Americans, we're gonna have to begin to invest in ourselves a little bit more.  We're gonna have to invest a little bit more in our institutions.  We're gonna have to take some of those dollars and make sure that those organizations and those companies you know, not only prospering, but they're thriving.  And we just have to go back to W.E.B. DuBois' philosophy, you know, for us, by us.
Story_ID: 74535
Speaker 1: Let us go back to your family life, and tell me--well you, you didn't give me the name of your sister.
Speaker 2: Ursula Mann.  U-R-S-U-L-A, M-A-N-N.
Speaker 1: And you say she's eleven years younger.
Speaker 2: Younger.
Speaker 1: Tell me something about your relationship with your sister.
Speaker 2: We have a wonderful relationship.  We've--it's funny.  I've always been a big brother to her.  And she was in, she was in--she lives in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and she has a very, very, very successful barbecue shack there.  So she visits, you know, when she can.  And one particular visit, she had a friend over to the house and they just happened to ask her--they say well how is he as a, as a big brother?  She says he was a great big brother and everything, and he, he gave me my first 100 dollars.  And he did this for me and he did that for me, and he would take me here and when I was--I did so-and-so.  And he did that.  And it was things that I had forgotten about.  But she remembered so vividly.  And so we're, we're very tight and we've talked about our relationship and we kind of like made a pact.  It's like you know our, our mother [Malinda Mann] has passed, my father's [Donald Mann] still living.  But it's like hey it's just you and I, it's me and you.  And regardless to what goes down, or whatever happens and everything, I want us to be able to sit down and apologize to each other and we both support each other.  'Cause it's just you and I.  And, and we both live that way with each other.  If I need her, I know she's right there.  And if she needs me, I'm there in a second.
Story_ID: 74536
Speaker 1: Do you have nieces and nephews?
Speaker 2: No, no I just became a grandfather.  My son [Dealan Mann] has just made me a grandfather of a beautiful granddaughter.
Speaker 1: Which, which--I didn't follow your romantic trail.
Speaker 2: I'm not sure you want to.
Speaker 1: You are married?
Speaker 2: No, I'm not married.
Speaker 1: Okay, how, how old is your son?
Speaker 2: My son will be thirty-one in January.
Speaker 1: And his name?
Speaker 2: His name is Dealan.
Speaker 1: What do you like most about being a father?
Speaker 2: I liked everything about being a father, actually.  I like helping in his development, helping see him grow.  Get--being able to give to him.  Like I said, my father [Donald Mann], like I said, gave me many gifts.  And in raising my son, I try to give him all the gifts that my father gave to me, plus the gifts that I wish I had gotten from my father.  Of course my father was born in the period where African American men really didn't express their selves, you know with love and, and that kind of thing.  So it's nothing unusual for my son and I to be seen kissing on the lips, for that matter, because I wanted, you know that kind, that kind of holding, bonding situation with my father.  But he is who he is, and that's the generation he, he comes from.  And I'm old enough now to understand that and accept that.
Speaker 1: What does your son do?
Speaker 2: He, he's an actor.  Yeah well he, he--I guess he kind of got it honestly, and he's a good actor, he's a good actor, he is, he's a very fine actor.  He lives in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and he's out there like everybody else, struggling.  But he has faith in himself and I'm pretty sure that he'll get his, he'll get his chance.  Back during the days of X-BAG [Experimental Black Actors Guild], I would be on stage rehearsing and he would be crawling around on the floor.  And we were--we were doing one particular play and the language was a little strong, let's say, and so I'm on stage and I'm fleh, blah, blah.  And way in the back of the theater you could hear this little tiny little voice going fleh, blah, blah.  And we were all--we were all kind of like stunned.  So, so he's gotten it--he's been around it long enough that he's gotten it pretty honestly.  But the ironic thing about it was that he had opportunities and I never pushed it on him, when he was much younger and he really didn't start doing it on his own until he was about maybe fifteen, sixteen years old.  And that was fine with me because I didn't wanna be a backstage dad or having to run him back and forth to auditions and that kind of thing.  So it's something that he came about--so it's something that he came about on his own.
Story_ID: 74537
Speaker 1: And you never married.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: That's not for you.
Speaker 2: I've been asked this question so many times.  The only way that I can explain it is that of all the things that I wanted to be, just a husband was not on the list.  I don't know why.  My mother [Malinda Mann] and father [Donald Mann], they ran around together since they were five years old.  And they were you know, childhood sweethearts and sweet 16 and you know and they were married until death they did part.  And they had a very wonderful, loving relationship.  I don't know, I don't know, maybe I'm a little afraid, maybe I'm even a little selfish about it, but it's just--it wasn't one of those things.  Now that I'm an old doddering man, I think about it sometimes but I still haven't made any major steps.  I like being alone.  I like myself and I like long periods of, of being by myself, you know.  I think a lot and it's kind of comfortable for me.  And see sometimes in relationships, okay c'mon get up, we gotta go here, we gotta do this, we gotta--well, some days you just don't--I'd rather--I gotta read a play.  I've got to get into that book.  I wanna, I wanna write something.  And I'm just not someone to be pulled and tugged in several different directions.  I guess--I can't explain it, I don't know.
Story_ID: 74538
Speaker 1: Speaking of writing, do you write a lot, or not so much?
Speaker 2: I'm not a disciplined writer.  I do have some ideas and I do have some stories to tell and I've had some experiences.  And when I tell people about these experiences, they're like man that--you should, you should write that.  You should put that in a--that needs to be--you know.  So I've been dabbling in it.  But again, I'm not a disciplined writer.  I, I work at it and haven't really finished it and I, I'm a perfectionist in, in the sense that I don't want it to be revealed until I know it's--so if it, if it takes me a little time, then I'll just--I'm in, I'm in no hurry.
Speaker 1: What kind of director are you?
Speaker 2: You're asking me--what kind of director people say I am.  I think I'm probably--people have described me as being an actor's director because I come from the boards.  And I, I can see inside of an actor's head, I know when they're, they're struggling.  I know when they're really fighting to try, to try to find something.  And, and I think I'm helpful in, in that sense.  But I, I kind of think of myself as a teaching director, you know I can, I can help you if you let me help you.  I, I love people to come with many ideas, many kinds of different interpretations and they've got a broadness and then I can help mold and put that together, you know, for what they're trying to do.  So I would say more, more of a teaching director.
Speaker 1: And are you more of an actor or a director?
Speaker 2: I think, I think it's almost--49 percent actor, 51 percent director.  And I think it's because I like telling people what to do.
Speaker 1: Did you get that from your father [Donald Mann]?
Speaker 2: Probably, probably.  Have to be in control.  Have to be in charge.  Have to know a lot.  Not everything, but have to know what I know.
Story_ID: 74539
Speaker 1: What is your relationship with your dad [Donald Mann] like today?
Speaker 2: My father's turned the corner a little bit in age and he's--he's not, he's not the same person that he's--he's had a little bout with some illness and the illness itself has made him turn the corner a little bit here.  I would say that we're close.  I would say that we have a healthy relationship.  I mean I--he is still my father, no doubt about that.  And he'll let you know that in no uncertain terms.  But because of the distance and because of my work, we don't spend that much time together.  We, we talk.  And when I, when I go--he's hard to talk to on the telephone.  So I, I have to go see him.  And when I see him, you know, it's, it's more or less the same relationship.  He's going to tell his stories and I'm gonna have to sit there and listen.
Speaker 1: Where do you go to see him?  Where is he?
Speaker 2: He's in Bangor, Michigan.
Speaker 1: So he stayed, you came back.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he can have Bangor.  He can, he can have all of it.  Well you know--times have changed.  When we first moved there, it's a little bit more bucolic, if you will.  You know there wasn't that proliferation of the drugs and the alcohol and the dissolution of the American family unit.  So, and by it being a small town, you know there's not a lot to do, so people usually find the negative things to do.  And he's there and he, of course he's older.  And a lot of people have passed away that were around his age.  And so he finds himself in a situation where there are a lot of younger people.  It's just hard for him to relate to their kind of lifestyles.
Speaker 1: Did he marry again?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  I know he misses my mother [Malinda Mann] and he misses her quite a bit.  She was his backbone.  My father--when my mother passed away--my father was the type of individual that--from that old school value system.  He brought his check home.  And my mother paid all the bills.  When my mother passed, my father didn't know how to write a check.  The amount, where you sign your name and--my sister [Ursula Mann] was tripping--she said look at how this knucklehead wrote this check, you know.  And so she took over for a while and then finally he, he got it together.  But he let my mother take care of the household.  That was, that was what she did.
Speaker 1: Now what year did she die?
Speaker 2: She died in 1989.
Speaker 1: That was difficult for you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I, I miss my ma, I do.  I miss her quietness.  I miss her, her economy of language.  I miss her smile and miss her--that look that she would give my father when he would say one of his nutty things that he'd say from time to time.  That, that look that she would give and that, that glance back at, at me and like that knowing glance.  Boy, do I miss her.  That was--and again that was the--aside from my grandmother [Vivian McPhan], that was the other important person in my life that you lose, you know.  I've experienced death, but when it happens to you, it's--it can be very painful.
Speaker 1: Had she been sick or anything?
Speaker 2: She did suffer from some respiratory ailments.  And they finally just took their toll on her.
Speaker 1: Where were you in your career when your mom passed?
Speaker 2: I was doing fine.  I was supporting myself, solely as an artist.  And so she definitely had that pride about her. That--
Speaker 1: So she did see that.
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.

Speaker 1: What would you like to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: My kindness, my generosity, my loyalty.  The kind of person that I am, the kind of man that I've grown into be.  The kind of person that--I've been here for you.
Speaker 1: What is a friend or enemy likely to say about you behind your back?
Speaker 2: My friends would say that that's Doug.  You know how, you, you know how Doug can be.  They'd probably say that.  My enemies would probably say behind my back he was hard guy to get next to.

Speaker 1: What would you like your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: That I was a hard worker.  That I was devoted to my craft and my family and that I had a big heart.
Story_ID: 74542
Speaker 1: Is there anything I didn't ask you that I should have?
Speaker 2: You pretty much well covered it.  Not that I can think of.
Speaker 1: Did you feel personally affected by the politics of your growing up years and your career years?
Speaker 2: I think everybody's affected by politics in one way or another.  If I sat down and thought of, of it in some point in time, then I would probably be able to make heads or tails of it, but I'm just one of those individuals that regardless of the stumbling blocks that you place before me, then I'm gonna find a way to overcome those obstacles.
Speaker 1: Did the Civil Rights period have any special meaning to you?
Speaker 2: I was, I was young, eighteen, nineteen years old at that particular time.  So it was, it was fresh and the--I guess getting caught up in the dogma of it or the, the newness of it, in time you know we all grew afros and we kind of got caught in, in maybe the trappings of it, of that particular time.  Interesting thing with my father [Donald Mann] again, he, he marched with [Rev. Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] when he came to the city that time.  And you know it was a--it was ugly, throwing bricks and bottles and racial epithets and that kind of thing.  And I remember that night sitting up with him and he made him a little sign to carry, and it was "Jim The Crow Must Go".  And on the other side of it was "Rat-nah" R-A-T, dash, N-A-H.  I remember, you know with the magic marker, the crayon, whatever it was and everything, coloring in those block letters.  And then the following day after the march and everything and how he come home, and how he was--how disappointed he was and how disenfranchised I think he felt because the marching and everything--and, and he wanted--although King was about the people, you know he wanted to fight back, he wanted to fight back.  He just didn't feel that it was, it was right, you know.  They were trying to march peacefully and that's what the intention that he went out there for.  And he just didn't feel that, you know, the, the name calling and the, the rock throwing and the bottle throwing and the feces throwing.  It got next to him.  And as a, I guess as the marchers and everything, you know I guess they kind of took it and he, he--it just never set right with him.  So at that point, he didn't carry anybody else's banner.  He didn't carry anybody else's flag.  He said he felt that he was gonna just make a difference with inside his family and with his children, and, and try to teach them how to be, how to be human beings.  How to be upstanding people.  How, how to be righteous in your beliefs and your convictions and everything and stand up for who and what you are.  So I, I remember that politics in that sense I guess it has affected me.  And since that time I think I've always been a person that wanted to do my own thing.  I wanted to march to the beat of my own drum I guess is how they say it.
Speaker 1: Now you seem in personality like a little bit of your mother [Malinda Mann], a little bit of your father.  Who do you look like the most?
Speaker 2: I guess the older I get, I look like, more like my father.  But I guess in my younger years I looked more like my mother.

Speaker 1: Okay.  You got any questions (unclear)?
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Maybe we could hear a little bit about the firsts that different theater companies you've been associated with have, you know, new works they've produced or even controversial works or groundbreaking.
Speaker 1: Groundbreaking.  There's really nothing new up under the sun.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Actually (unclear).
Speaker 1: There's, there's really nothing new up under the sun.  I mean issues have been around for a long time and they've been discussed or they've been attacked for whatever reason.  So I guess it's about where you find yourself living in what period of time.  Things that people find groundbreaking, I, I'm kind of like amazed that you would find that shocking.  I mean these issues have been around before.  I mean things (unclear) a little cyclical kind of--you know what goes around comes around and that kind of thing.  So I don't know what--I think that's for other people to say; that it's groundbreaking, is what I think I'm trying to say.  I don't look at like this is gonna be a groundbreaking piece.  It's gonna just shatter the thoughts and the ideals.  I, I don't look at it like that.  I'm like this is an interesting piece of work.  I would like to produce this work.  And when the work is up and people come up and they say that's great and everything.  I politely say thank you, then I look for another good piece of work.  So I, I don't, I don't interpret things in, in, in those--
Speaker 2: I think some of the articles written about your work say risky.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Now, yeah, but again, I think that's for them to say.  You know it's just thing that I'm--I kind of think (unclear).  Like I say I like, I like to push your buttons a little bit, you know.  You know I'm--I see what's being presented out here and I see in style and fashion what people are doing.  And I see some work and I'm like nobody in the world would touch that, except me.
Speaker 2: That's great.  I'm going to end it right there.  Okay thank you very, very much.
