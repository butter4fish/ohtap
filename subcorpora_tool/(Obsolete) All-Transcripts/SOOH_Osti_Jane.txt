 Little Thunder  Osti  My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Monday, May  2, 2011  and I   m interviewing Jane Osti as part of the Oklahoma  Native Artists Project sponsored by the Oklahoma Oral History  Research Program at Oklahoma State University. We   re at Jane   s  studio and gallery in Tahlequah. Jane, I   ve watched your pottery  develop and refine itself over a number of years, earning you a long list  of awards as well as the designation of a Living Treasure by Cherokee  Nation. Where you born and where did you grow up?  I was born here in Tahlequah at the old Hastings Indian Hospital and I  grew up north of here about fourteen miles in Terrace Side, Rocky Ford  area and went to Oaks Mission High School.  What did your folks do for a living?  My mom died when I was five years old. My dad did mining. And the  last part of his life, for thirty or forty years, he did ranching and cattle.  Mining here in this area?  Northeast Oklahoma.  Were your grandparents a factor in your early life?  They died when I was pretty young, actually. Especially on my Indian  side, I think. I didn   t really get to know them. They died when I was  really young. My other grandmother, she only lived till I was twenty  and I was around her quite a bit.  This was your dad   s mom?  Yes.  5  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Were you around the Cherokee language much growing up?  We had Indian kids at school. We heard all the funny words, the bad  words. (Laughter) But I really wasn   t around a lot of speakers. There  were a few people I knew that spoke, but when we   d come to  Tahlequah on Saturdays, we   d always hear the people around the  Square. Around the old Cherokee court house, you   d hear people  speaking Cherokee, and my grandma and grandpa both spoke. They  spoke to their friends in Cherokee, the Indian side. My sister tells me  these stories. I don   t remember them because she used to come town  with them every Saturday and they would meet their friends to speak  Cherokee.  What are your earliest memories of doing art?  There wasn   t any art going on in my life as a child. I think once when I  was in the fourth or fifth grade, I was at a school where they had an art  class. Other than that, there wasn   t any until I lived on my own.  The one art class that you had in fourth grade, did you paint for that or  draw pictures?  It was like poster paint. I remember it was Thanksgiving and we got to  do a pumpkin or something. (Laughter) That   s my memory of art. The  only art that I was around as a child was the little cards they gave you  in Sunday school when you   re real little. I thought they were beautiful.  Beautiful colors. That and calendars.  Where you around any Indian art?  No. My mom was the Indian person in my parents. She died when I  was five and we lived with my dad   s folks. So, the only Indian people I  was around was a couple of times a year when somebody would visit us  from my mom   s family and the kids at school that were Indian.  You didn   t do any modeling with mud or clay that you can remember?  Any three-dimensional work?  I made some mud pies but that is about it. (Laughter)  Secondary school, was that in Tahlequah? Junior High?  No. It was all, that little country school and in Oaks. We didn   t even  call it secondary then because we went through the eighth grade at the  country school and then we went to the mission school.  6  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  At the mission school, is where you got your high school education and  were exposed to some art classes?  No, they had no art classes there either.  When you went on to Northeastern State University was that  immediately after high school? Did you have some work experience in-between?  I worked and I think I made my art of out of flower gardens and sewing  and all kinds of things for years, and house-fixing.  Because you got married and had a family.  Yeah. When I was thirty-three, I started to community college in San  Francisco. I went to school there for about five or six years, community  college. Just taking courses I wanted to take. I would take five or six art  courses per semester. As many as I could do. (Laughter) I moved to  Southern California when I was twenty-one and I lived there till I was  forty.  When I was married there, I went to community college there. Then I  moved back here in    85. I moved there in    67 and moved back here in     85. When I went to Northeastern, I think I was just maybe fifteen  hours short of my Bachelor   s. I wasn   t even trying to get a degree.  I   d taken everything for fun. So, I finished that, then I did my Master   s.  In San Francisco at the community college, what media were you  taking classes in?  Everything from line drawing to portrait drawing, painting. Everything  they offered. Watercolor. I took everything they offered except for the  clay classes.  Were you thinking of yourself as an artist?  I just knew I wanted to do it forever. I didn   t think about having to  make a living at that time. I just knew the first time I smelled it, saw it,  that   s what I wanted to do. (Laughter)  You are talking about paint at this point? The smells of the painting  class and stuff?  Yeah. But I loved drawing, any of it. I loved all of it. I can   t even think  of the names of the classes now, it   s been so long ago. (Laughter) I  7  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  liked every one of them.  Did you get any encouragement from teachers there?  Super encouragement, yeah. I even loved the art history classes there.  We had such a wonderful teacher.  When you came to Northeastern State University, you were taking an  Indian studies class and you decided you were going to do a paper on  Anna Mitchell. Had you met Anna before?  No. That is when I was in my first pottery class and taking a Cherokee  history class. And when I got into the pottery, of course, I heard of  Anna. I heard of her pottery through the Indian studies class because  people knew about her in pottery. I was also taking an archeology class  at the same time where we were talking about pottery. It just all came  together and when I got that assignment, I called and asked if I could  interview her and that   s how we got to know each other.  Your first experience with pottery, was it immediately a strong  connection?  Just like the other. (Laughter) I had postponed taking pottery and  sculpture because I wasn   t interested in it. I wasn   t interested in the  three-dimensional. And once I got in that class, I was as addicted to it  as I was to paint. (Laughter) The teacher had a lot of to do with it. He  was a wonderful teacher, Jerry Choate at NSU. He   s retired now. He  would smell the clay and talk about how wonderful it smelled and how  wonderful it felt. And boy, I was right behind him thinking, he   s right.  (Laughter)  When you called Anna and asked if you could interview her, do you  remember that interview?  Very much. I was scared to death. (Laughs) She was very kind. She  was very stern and professional and now she   s not. (Laughter) She  didn   t know what I wanted from her, and I didn   t know what I wanted  from her either. She   s been my teacher, my mentor and my friend over  twenty years now, closer to twenty-five. It took her twenty-two years to  say I love you. She said it a couple of years ago. (Laughter) But we  became friends. We   re good friends.  While you were talking with her did she have pots around? She was  showing you some of her work?  I was in love with everything she had.  8  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Which was very innovative at the time.  We wouldn   t have pottery in Oklahoma   most likely, we wouldn   t  have Cherokee potters, if Anna hadn   t have started doing it in the    60s.  There   s a few people, I suppose, that have tried pottery but nobody has  reached the level that she did in creating Cherokee pottery. She didn   t  just do Cherokee pottery. She did anything that was Southeast, because  at the time when she was doing research, we didn   t have Internet.  Anything that was Southeastern she would do it. It didn   t have to be  specifically Cherokee. And I have pretty much done that, too, for  twenty years. But lately, the last five years or so, since I   ve met some  Cherokee artists from the East and gotten acquainted with the things on  the Internet, we can find some specifically Cherokee pots now.  When did you first ask her if you could study with her?  I   d seen her giving a demonstration somewhere and I watched her do  that pottery demonstration. I moved to the Vinita area for one year and  I worked with her all the time I was there, firing and making pottery  and digging clay with her. I was lucky enough to be there for one whole  year to work with her.  You had these two lines of training, I guess.  The first training I had with Jerry Choate was really, really important.  He really instilled a love of the clay, a love of the form. It was a real  education   I wouldn   t have been ready for Anna if I hadn   t had that  earlier time with him. He was a wonderful artist. He made beautiful  forms. The way he touched the clay and sort of revered the clay was  something I   ll always remember about him. I followed him around  everywhere for about three or four years. (Laughter) I wanted to know  anything he had to teach. He was very good, a really good teacher.  Were you trying any clay sculpture with Indian motifs at NSU?  Yes. I also took his sculpture class. The first sculpture I did was a nude  torso. When I got to the hand, he modeled for the hand but it was a  female sculpture. (Laughter) We did a few other things. We did some  busts and then I did a sculpture that was a tribute to Anna. It   s not a  portrait likeness, but it   s a tribute to her. That is at the Center for Tribal  Studies. They ended up casting it in bronze. The Cherokee Nation,  Wilma Mankiller and Don Betts, were pretty much the ones that settled  the deal, although Dennis Snell was real responsible. A lot of other  people helped get it off the ground.  9  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Jerry Choate wasn   t working with native clays, was he? But Anna was.  Do you remember the first time you went to dig clay with her?  Yes. (Laughs) In fact, Phyllis Fife, Dennis Snell and I went to her  house and did a video that day. I didn   t dig any clay that day. I watched  her and Bob dig it, her husband. We did a video that   s in the library at  NSU. It   s very good. They were just wonderful in showing us and  telling us. She went all the way through, from digging to demonstrating  how to make a pot, to firing that day when we got done videoing. They  were a wonderful little couple, real gracious and just shared everything  with us.  When did you first begin then making pots on your own and showing  professionally?  I started taking classes with Jerry Choate in    87, I believe. Met Anna  that year, did the sculpture of her by    89, and I think    90 was my first  year at Red Earth. That was my first show outside of Tahlequah.  Did you enter a competition piece?  Yes. I took the big sculpture of Anna and I got an honorable mention.  Kelly Haney came by my booth. He really liked it. (Laughter)  How did that make you feel?  Really good. It made me want to enter more shows and start doing Red  Earth and Aspen, all of those. The early Aspen shows, remember those?  Then I started going to the Wichita, Heard  Museum  show and  Lawrence,  Kansas . I think by    94, I had gotten in the Heard and    95 in  Santa Fe. I started showing in 1990.  Santa Fe   s been a pretty important market for you?  It has. It   s been a real good market for me until the last few years. I  think it   s the economy, or there   s just a million potters there, too.  (Laughter)  In terms of the competition aspect, has that been tricky?  I won an award every year I was there, except one. I didn   t win one in  2000. But I   ve won one every other year I   ve been there. Sometimes  Second, Third, sometimes First. I   ve never won one of their big giant  awards but won First a few times. They   ve started a Woodland division  and John Nez has told me it was because of one of my fish pots I  entered. He came by my booth a couple of years ago and said,    We are  10  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  going to start having a Woodland category.    I probably shouldn   t be  saying that  but  he told me it was because of that pot.  What kind of reception did you get for your pots in the early days when  Cherokee pottery wasn   t that well- known here in Oklahoma?  In Oklahoma you still don   t get much of a reaction to pottery. (Laughs)  People think it   s not art unless they can hang it on the wall and it   s a  painting. There aren   t a lot of pottery collectors in Oklahoma, I don   t  believe. David Boren has one of my pots. I think it might be getting a  little better known. Anna said when she first started going to Santa Fe  that people would tell her, you shouldn   t be making that. Cherokees  didn   t make pottery.  When in fact she was reviving an old tradition. So there was Anna  obviously, and then Bill Glass, Mike Daniels and yourself, but it   s  always been a small group. Has that made it easier or harder to market  your work?  Well, say Santa Fe, for instance. The few people that are educated and  know about Woodland pottery and know that it   s the old pottery and  know about Mound pottery, they like collecting it. Some people just  like it because of what it looks like. Then, the ones that are there strictly  for Southwest pottery, they won   t even look at any other pottery. They  just shoot right on by. Then there are people that know what it is and  they are very interested. They say 80 or 90 percent of people that come  to Market are looking for pottery. Maybe 1 percent of them are looking  for Woodland pottery. (Laughter)  So it   s a pretty hard market.  Yeah, but it   s the best market we have. When I go to a show in the  Midwest here there is not that much interest in pottery. Eiteljorg,   Indiana  has been pretty good, but they draw clientele from the  Chicago and Milwaukee region and all around.  What were some early galleries in Oklahoma that you dealt with?  Linda Greever at the Art Market, of course. She was one of my first  supporters. She was very good to me. The Cherokee gift shops have  always bought from me. Several years ago, Doris Littrell. She was kind  and supported me. I haven   t done much gallery work in Oklahoma.  Lovett   s Gallery   right now I have some work at their gallery. But  doing the shows constantly the way I was for a few years like eight, ten  or twelve shows a year, there wasn   t much left over for galleries. I have  done  a show at  the Turquoise Tortoise. I can   t even remember the  11  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  galleries that I   ve been in. Quite a few, at one time.  And you can   t exactly finish things on the road like a painter and  sculptor can.  No. What you have when you leave, that   s it.  You were coming in at the very beginning of the    90s. What are your  other impressions of that art scene?  At the Indian art shows, I think people are looking for jewelry to adorn  the body and then  to  adorn the walls or tables. The best markets for  pottery for me have been in the Southwest. The Heard or Pueblo  Grande. A couple of the other shows. Colorado was pretty good at one  time. I didn   t do  Colorado  Indian Market much but Grand Junction  and Aspen   some of those shows were pretty good. I never really had  great sales at Red Earth. I know Pahponee does with her pottery.  Maybe my pottery just didn   t strike a chord with them.  You have been designated a master artist by the Five Tribes Museum,  haven   t you?  No.  That   s an oversight. They need to get around to that. (Laughter) But  you were honored as a Living Treasure by the Cherokee Nation in  2005. What has that designation meant to you?  Well, I like the group of people I am connected with, in connection  with being a Treasure. When I first got it, I was one of the younger  ones. Now there   s some that are younger than me. The last few years  they have awarded to four or five people that are quite a bit younger,  where at one time it was mostly elders. The group of elders I   m  connected with, and the young ones too, I   ve really enjoyed the  camaraderie and the get-togethers we have and learning from them,  visiting with them. So, it   s made that possible. I may have not have  gotten to know them if we weren   t being Treasures together. (Laughter)  You started your gallery in 2005 and you   ve done a lot to support their  work through your gallery.  They   ve always been welcome to show their work here and I don   t take  a commission from them. What they sell is theirs. I   ve enjoyed them  very much. They   ve told me some great stories and we have had some  good laughs.  12  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Have they inspired any pieces?  In pottery? No. I have all their handprints on a plate, though, or several  of them. (Laughter) No, they   re just real different artists. One of them  makes buffalo grass dolls; one does weaving, and basket makers. I love  and admire their work, but it really is a million miles away from  pottery.  You   ve had a couple of casino commissions as I understand it. Is that  correct?  They   ve bought quite a lot, some to exhibit and some for different  rooms. I don   t know where all they put it, but they   ve helped me out a  lot. Bought quite a bit the last three or four years.  I was wondering if these have been more like sculptural installations or  actually pots?  They   ve actually bought things I already have instead of com-missioning  me to make things. Except the shield-type things. They did  order a bunch of those to put in different rooms. They bought a couple  of paintings. I think they bought a few sculptures but it was things that I  had.  Do you have any kids or grandkids or extended family who are  interested in learning pottery?  They   re all a little bit interested and no one is really ready to go for it.  (Laugh) I have a lot of students that have continued to make pottery. I  think at one time at the art show at the Heritage Center there was like  eight people that had entered pieces that had been through the classes.  Oh, that   s a real tribute.  Yeah. Cherokee Nation has really helped me in the respect of being  able to teach a lot of people because the last few years I   ve worked with  public schools.  As an artist in the schools?  No, they come to me. I teach the teachers and then they take it back to  the school. Teachers, community members, JOM  Johnson O   Malley   members that are interested in learning. Then they teach it in the  community.  That   s wonderful. So that   s a Cherokee Nation program.  13  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Yeah. I   ve heard that three or four schools, at least, that their JOM or  their program like that, had gotten pottery grants this year, so they  could set up pottery rooms in their schools.  It feels good. Anna taught her daughter  Victoria , myself and Crystal   Hanna . The three of us continue to do pottery. She taught dozens  more   I just don   t know who they are, but she always taught. The three  of us have continued to make pottery. Victoria and Crystal are going to  be teaching some classes here in our new studio, too. Anyway, I was  thinking about making it a family tree with Anna, me, Crystal and  Victoria. Then, the ones we have taught but not everybody we have  taught, because obviously that would be a pretty big tree. But people  that have continued to do it. We told Anna about it the other day. Make  a pottery tree. (Laughter)  So your mission for the gallery and studio has not just been to promote  your own work.  It wouldn   t be all that fun if it was just myself.  It   s really a teaching site.  Yes. I   ve taught in here for all these years. Now the other building will  enable me to get the clay dust out of the gallery part. The new place  absolutely will be   I think of it as a teeny Pottery Institute. A real  teeny one. Also, a good place to go work. We will have ongoing  continual classes there. I have Crystal and Victoria and Scott Roberts  and Troy Jackson, several award-winning potters  and  sculptors lined  up to help teach those classes.  How has your teaching influenced your art?  I always learn things from the students. Even the little kids. I  occasionally do schools still. I will almost start to correct the little kids  and I   ll see what they   re doing, and then I   ll think,    Oh, I like that. I  wish I   d thought of that.    Anyway, there   s just about always a student  that will make that happen. In every class. I did some teaching at  Northeastern a few years ago as an adjunct in the evening. There was  never a class I taught that I didn   t learn something from some student  that I still use right now. I like that, when that happens.  Do you use mainly native clay from Oklahoma?  I still dig some clay. Very little, though, to be honest. I probably make  three or four pots a year with the native clay. I still teach how to     14  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  we go dig it and I teach them how to process it and use it. It   s so labor-intensive  and I work so many classes, and doing my own work. It takes  a lot of time and a lot of labor to produce it, but it   s worth it when you  do. (Laughs)  Even when you   re buying clay, the process of getting it ready is  physically demanding.  Well, the clay you buy is ready to go. And as far as I can tell, clay you  buy and clay you dig, the big difference is processing. You process it or  somebody else processes it. Clay is still clay. It   s still out of the earth. I  don   t know what is added to it other than things that come out of the  earth.  Are you mainly working with the coil?  Yes. Coil method. Coil and slab. Flattened clay or rolled clay.  When I first saw your work, it was medium size and it   s been  evolving   to these larger formats. What are the challenges of working in large  formats?  Having it hold together. (Laughter) Physical, lately. Just being able to  handle it because you handle it a lot during the making. I still find it  most rewarding to work large. I force myself to make little pots and  medium-sized pots.  But that is not your real interest.  Not really. I would probably, if there was a market for them, make  large pots all the time.  What about what you fire with?  Most times, I use an electric kiln and I will sawdust or wood fire  the  clay  to achieve the coloring, the darkening on several of them that you  can see here. But when I do the traditional clay, the hand-dug clay and  do traditional firing, I use wood to fire it. On most of the others that are  double-fired, they have been sawdust fired or flash-fired with kindling.  Did you ever have anything break during the firing that you actually  were able to use in a different way? (Laughs)  Not really. (Laughter) I   ve put some of them in the yard for garden arts.  Have you ever been interested in pots that are functional?  15  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  The first several years when I was wheel throwing, that   s what I made,  the wheel-thrown pots. We made pitchers; we made a lot of vases. We  learned to make coffee cups and pitchers and all that sort of thing.  I didn   t make a lot of those. (Laughter) It was fun learning to make  handles, though. (Laughs) And you can still put them on pots.  Your work goes in so many different veins. One would be that you have  got a pot and then you  do  some incised designs on it or something  very texture-y.  I   ve been studying how Cherokees made pottery and what it   s used for,  for the last several years. This pot, for instance, is paddle stamping  from a wooden paddle. That was the last type of pottery made in North  Carolina in the East before Removal. It   s 2,900 years old, the paddle  stamping technique, so Cherokees were using it for a long, long time. I  have five pots over there that represent 3,000 years of Cherokee  pottery. The first ones are kind of molded or modeled and probably  stamped with reed or textiles, and then it comes on up through the  paddle stamping. I like knowing why things were done to pottery. This  stamping helped conduct the heat better for the cooking pots. It made it  easier to hold on  to , where it wouldn   t slip through your hands. Then,  of course, we always like things to be beautiful, so it always had, I  think, a beautiful design.  Did you make the replicas?  No, I didn   t make those. A friend of mine   well, I have only known  her for a few years, Tammy Bean, she does museum replicas for all the  museums in the Southeast. I bought those from her. When they want  something reproduced, not just reproduced but replicas, she does them.  Another vein of your work is you will have this motif like the oak leaves  or the butterflies, then you will replicate it around the opening of the  mouth of the pot a bit. And you   ll have some negative space as well as  the incised designs.  I think that comes way back from drawing and design classes. This clay  is now my canvas and things that I used to do in design classes, I   ve  transferred to doing on clay. I just started working with more things  from nature in the last two or three years. Although the old designs are  all about nature   they   re all representing wind or water, something  from nature. The effigy pots reflect everything that was in daily life  years and years ago. This is a canoe pot, a fish pot, squash pots, from  food to food to transportation in nature. So, nature is in all of them,  really.  16  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  You   ve got another vein which is sometimes just a burnished pot, but it  has all of these beautiful bumps, it   s all about the shape of it. It doesn   t  have ornamentation, but the way it catches light is so interesting.  Are you talking about like the one here on the end? I really, really like  just shape and form without all the design and decoration. I really,  really like it but it   s really, really hard for me not to decorate every  square inch. (Laughter)  In terms of salability, do people appreciate those as much?  No. They like the decorated. They think you did more work on them.  And actually, it is harder for me to do a plain one. (Laughs) When I  took art history, I remember this term,    vacui horror.    And when I get  going on a pot, I think I have    vacui horror,    fear of vacant spaces.  (Laughter) Sometimes I just don   t want it to end. If I can see I only  have a few more inches to go      No     I want to keep going forever.  (Laughter)  Do you have a favorite part of the process? Is it actually the  decorating?  I actually like building, seeing them take shape. The decorating I like  just as well, I guess. (Laughter) But I really love the pottery when it   s  still wet and has just been formed or just been born. That   s the stage I  love it the most. It seems to lose something after it dries and hardens.  In that stage, I think, is when I love it the most.  (Laughs)What is your creative process, starting with when you get your  ideas, how you get them?  Well, the old pottery is pretty much the foundation of everything I do,  but if I start to make a pot and I say, for instance,    I   m going to make a  squash pot,    it may not turn out to be a squash pot. It may be another  pot entirely. I just let it lead me a bit and sometimes I force it to be  what I want it to be. (Laughter) But it   s really pretty nice when you just  let the clay kind of lead you where you go. And sometimes, it   s not.  Sometimes I think I need to get a little more orderly about what I do.  (Laughs)    Okay, I   m going to make this, and make it.     Do you do any sketching before you do a pot?  Sometimes. Of course, sometimes I don   t.  But it still might end up being something else?  17  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  It has hardly ever stayed what I sketched. (Laughs) But I have looked at  some of the old pots and said,    Okay, I   m going to make a canoe pot,  for instance, or a fire pot.    I have one over there. I call it a fire pot, it   s  used to carry embers. You have to stick to your guns if you make a fire  pot or a canoe pot. (Laughs) I pretty much look at the old ones and stick  to it, but usually they get some variation on the theme. I   m not really  interested in doing replicas or reproductions although some people  might think I am because they see something and recognize it as  looking like one of the old ones. My friend, Tammy, takes a tape  measure with her and lays a penny beside it and it   s going to be as close  as she can get it. I am not after that. I do like to experience making  some of the old ones that were made before me. That   s a way of just  paying tribute, I think, to the old peoples.  So what   s your creative routine, especially when you   re teaching and  making work?  Does  it just depend from day to day or do you try to  get a number of certain hours in the studio?  I might be working at three in the morning or four in the morning. It   s  always on the other side of sleep. I don   t work late into the night as a  rule. I wake up early. (Laughs) I like the early morning hours for  working and I   m quiet in the morning. Things come to me that I might  want to do, and there   s not any noise around or nobody awake, usually.  That   s my time to   that   s when, I guess, the Muse comes. (Laughter)  The Muse, or the moose. (Laughter)  Looking backing on your career so far, what do you think was one of  the important forks in your career?  Gosh, I can   t think of anything major. From going to school to going to  shows, I pretty much continued going to school and then doing the  shows and working for years and years, and then teaching. It   s been the  phases. Right now is a big teaching phase, but in my work, there hasn   t  been anything real big, I don   t believe, that   s taken me in different  directions. Except every few years I feel like I have to kind of reinvent  myself because I would get bored making the same thing for twenty  years. (Laughter) Maybe if you mean that kind of thing. Turning places.  I think meeting with the Cherokee North Carolina artists. The group  back there was a big turning point for Oklahoma pottery.  When did that happen?  2005. That   s when I must have moved here, in 2004. They came here  and taught us in 2005, the paddle-stomping technique. Tammy Bean,  the one that did the replicas, she came with them. And she   s the one  18  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  that had taught them. They had lost it for over a hundred years. She  taught them in 2000, I think, and they came and taught us in 2005. That  was quite a turning point. It allowed us to find out more about what  Cherokee pottery really was instead of just Southeastern pottery.  Who was at the workshop with you?  Bill came and Anna came to visit. When Anna saw what they were  teaching us, she said,    I wish I would have known this thirty years  ago.    Bill came and he observed, but he did his own thing. (Laughter) I  think most of the people that participated, there were about twelve,  most of them were students that I was having in class, except for Bill,  and we invited him to come. Just anyone that was working in clay that I  knew of, we invited them to participate. That was a pretty big turning  point for us. I kind of got lost in it for a while, trying to do what they  did. It took three or four years before I came back to doing what I do,  and incorporating what I learned from them, instead of trying to be  them.  Sounds like the community of artists that you show with has been really  important to you.  They   ve been like extended family. You go to a show and there is  always someone to help you out, whether it be loading or unloading. I  remember one time I was just smothering and Tiller Wesley brings me  a bottle of water. We   ve just all helped each other out on the road at  some time or another. You may have a booth neighbor in Colorado and  then you may see them all the way across the country. You   re friends  and like family the next time you are together. It   s been a really  wonderful opportunity to meet people from other tribes and get to know  them a little bit. I   ve had everyone from people in Montana that I   d  never even heard of their tribe before that I became friends with.  Anyway, that has been really neat and our immediate family of friends,  there   s been times when I   ve had people cover my room or help me  with gas in the beginning. So, that family of friends has been real  important.  What about the business part of art? What were some of your best  learning experiences or challenges?  I don   t think I   m much of a business person, and if I would have had a  business major, I might have done a lot better. (Laughter) Or a  secretary or something. All of the business part   s a challenge. People  are lucky when they have partners with them that take care of that side  of it.  19  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  How about pricing your work?  That has been tricky, too, over the years to know. Before the economy  kind of went crashing, I pretty much had a handle on the price it should  be because it was selling pretty much. But I don   t know what to put on  it right now.  And the bigger pieces take so much effort and time, basically your  whole lifetime to do. When people say how long did it take you to do  this,  what do you say ?  That   s everybody   s favorite question. (Laughter)  What   s been one of the low points in your career?  I suppose in the eight years after I started, just not being able to make a  living doing what I really love to do. I felt like quitting a couple of  times. My good friend Robert Connelly, I was having a discussion with  him once, and he proceeded to explain success to me. He said,    Success  is not financial, not always just financial.    He just helped me look at it  a little different. If I can tough it out and this is what I want to do, that  would be success. There have been tough financial times with it. I don   t  think I   ve ever had a tough time about having a passion for the work  and wanting to do the work. So, it   s never really gone down at all. I  would work every day if I could. If life didn   t interfere. (Laughs) I  really would, but every once in a while you have family and life that  happens.  How about one of the high points in your career? An award or not  necessarily, maybe just an experience with an artist or a collector?  There   s been so many of those, I have a hard time thinking of one.  There   ve been many wonderful collectors and awards that have been  really good.  What do you think has been one of the more important awards you have  received?  Gosh, I don   t know about the awards. I think David Boren was one of  the people I enjoyed most buying a pot because he invited me to his  house to bring it to him, and took me on a tour. He showed me his  whole art collection and then he sent me over to the museum with Mary  Jo Watson to see the Spiro collection. Anyway, he was one of the most  enjoyable sales I ever made, delivering it and visiting with him. I have  two or three collectors that have been wonderful to me, well, four or  five, really, friends and collectors. I won   t mention their names,  but   20  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  they   ve all been high points. There   s one in Dallas, a couple in  Arkansas and Mel Perlman that has done so much for the Eitlejorg  Museum. He was the first person that bought several thousand dollars  worth from me. Then, my one collector in Arkansas has just been so  good to me. He probably has twenty, thirty pieces. The one in Dallas  does, too.   But  the collectors come and go. They fade away. They get to twenty  or thirty pots, then you don   t have the same collector anymore. They  pretty much bought the same type of things through the years. I   ve  made some odd different things that have sold. They pretty much like  the traditional pottery, those major collectors.  In terms of the involvement of the tribes with tribal artists, have you  seen some positive changes? Is there more that needs to be done?  I think the last several years the tribe has allocated 1 percent of casino  sales to buying art with. And that has helped a lot of artists. I hope it   s  spread out to a lot of them. But I know it   s helped out a whole lot of  artists. Maybe they could do more, for instance with the elders, I think  they could buy more of their art to help sustain them through some  pretty rough fixed incomes and some hard times, and maybe they will.  Maybe they just need to be made aware of them. I try my best to make  them aware of it. (Laughter)  What is the next show you have planned for your gallery?  We   ll be having our grand opening for our new studio classroom this  month, the thirteenth. Then probably not anything until  Cherokee   Homecoming on Labor Day for the studio. I   ll be going to Santa Fe,  hopefully, in August, but as soon as I get back from that, we always  have a Homecoming show during the Cherokee holiday.  Is that a pretty good time for you?  It   s a busy time. As far as sales, it can go either way. But   s a real busy  time for people who are Cherokee to come back and visit Oklahoma  and visit their friends and relatives. And we have a lot of art shows,  three shows going on that weekend. One at the museum, one at the  armory and one here, and maybe at other places, too. (Laughter)  There   s three that I   m involved with.  Just thinking about getting ready for Santa Fe, which as I understand is  the main big show you do, how many pieces typically do you try to  take?  21  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  The pots, probably ten  to  fifteen. I used to do a lot of the smaller wall  hangings. I used to take as many as thirty or forty wall hangings in  addition to ten to fifteen pots. I think only one time, I came close to  selling all of the pots. I usually bring quite a few of them back with me.  (Laughter) But that   s okay. I have three shows as soon as I get back.  It   s sometimes harder for artist to keep that much work, but you have  been able to keep a few things?  Not much, just broken things.  What do you call your wall again?  Intensive Care Unit. (Laughs) They all have a crack or a break. Broken  shoulders, broken lips. (Laughs)  Is there anything that we   ve forgotten to talk about, anything you would  like to add?  I can   t think of anything, Julie, except you   re a good interviewer and  you   ve made me very comfortable. Thank you. (Laughs)  Well, we   re going to go ahead and take a look at some of your work  now. You want to tell us a little bit about this pot?  This is called a canoe pot. It   s a middle-Mississippian pottery that was  made around 1300, probably. I don   t have my information in front of  me. It   s an effigy form that represents a canoe.  So an effigy pot is?  A representation. We had a lot of them that represented food and  animals and, in this case, a canoe. I first made this pot about eight years  ago   the only other time I made it, I met Lloyd Kiva New  Director of  the Institute of American Indian Arts .  Yes, it was just a few months, I think, before he passed. Anyway, I  liked him a whole lot and I gave him the first canoe pot I ever made.  That was a nice experience. He told me a lot about the Mounds that I  didn   t know.  And this would be one that has gone through two firings?  Yes, it was kiln-fired and then sawdust-fired. The little nodes going  around there is real representative of that period. I don   t know what  they meant, but a lot of the pots had nodes. I think it probably helped  22  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  hang on to them or  was  decorative. Probably a little bit of each.  These originally were very small. This pot is called a burr pot. I   ve also  seen it in museums where it   s called a fire pot. It was used to carry  embers for the fire. That   s why it has handles. I imagine the little burs  and nodes on it kept it from slipping and probably helped conduct the  heat to keep the heat going. Some of them had the little nodes all over  them. I like the design shape of it, although it was a functional pot. I  think it had a very important mission to carry embers to keep the fire  alive.  In terms of the color, when this was fired, double-fired, what did you  use?  I do a lot of sawdust firings, so I would say it probably is sawdust. But  this was a white clay, so it doesn   t go the dark color, or it could go  black, just depending on how much fuel you use and how well you  cover it. It was probably exposed to a lot of air to go the grey color.  Do you want to tell us about these two pots?  The orb with the butterflies, that   s more of a sculptural piece than it is a  pot. It doesn   t have an opening, but the butterflies, of course, from  nature and the designs surrounding them, the foundation of it is from  the old pottery. It   s just a way to be creative and not make the usual pot.  To do something a little something different with it.  You can really see the dimensionality of it. There   s an outer layer and  these inner layers.  So  you weren   t adding anything to the coils after  you were done, you were just taking away?  After it was smoothed and finished up smooth, then I started carving  into it, drawing and carving into it.  What do you use for your carving?  A chopstick I use a lot for drawing. I just use something to pull the clay  out. Just a tool, either wood or metal. Usually, wooden tools I like. A  lot of it   s pushed away, rather than cut away.  And the pot on the left?  Out in the Southwest, they call them melon pots, but I call them squash  pots because most of our old images look  more  like squash and  pumpkins to me, than it did the melons. Once again it   s an effigy, a  representation of the plant, and plants were important. A plant that was  23  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  Little Thunder  Osti  a very important food source, one of the Three Sisters, the beans,  squash     Do you want to explain the significance of the three sisters?  Okay. (Laughs) Well corn, beans, squash. The corn provided the stalk  for the beans to wrap around. The leaves from the squash provided the  shade to do the weeding, and the beans also replenished the soil with  nitrogen, and then we had something good to eat with it. We don   t ever  have agriculture without pottery, they go hand in hand. (Laughs)  Wherever people make pottery, they have agriculture, and it   s usually  discovered simultaneously whether it   s along the Nile, Rio Grande or  the Mississippi.   Showing a different pot  That one   s a large cooking pot with a  Cherokee stamp on the bottom. Mooney took pictures of people using  that particular stamp in the early 1900s. The top, with the banded top  and the notched rim, it   s typical Overhill Cherokee pottery. I guess     over the hill    meant over the mountain into Tennessee.  Is this the paddle motif that you were talking about?  Yes. The paddle design on that one is a version of the friendship  pattern, which was taken from basket work and added to pottery since  we   re basket makers, usually, before potters because we   re hunters and  gatherers before we   re agricultural. This is quite a large pot but some of  our pots hold five to ten gallons. I guess they were used for very big  feast occasions. That one may be a five or four gallon  pot .  So that must have been an amazing technique that they had for firing  something that big.  I have seen some of them in museums. They   re wonderful. Some of  them are this tall.  Gestures  I   ve tried to make a few of them that tall.  Jane, I want to thank you for your time today. It has been wonderful  seeing your work again.  Thank you, thank you.  -------  -------
