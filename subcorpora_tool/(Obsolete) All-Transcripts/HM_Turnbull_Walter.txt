Speaker 2: Oh, oh, Ms. Jones, well, Ms. Herticene Jones--Herticene Jones in, in Greenville, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: You were telling me that she would always say something to you or, or maybe it was Ms. Crawford.  Anyway, we'll get to that.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, Ms. Crawford, you will do this, or you will do that, you know, in her very quiet, quiet voice.  She was quite something.
Story_ID: 297102
Speaker 1: We'll start in Greenville, Mississippi with your mother.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Your mother's name and date of birth?
Speaker 2: Lena Love Turnbull, married name, Turnbull, but Green, she was a Green.
Speaker 1: And she--do you know her date of birth?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't get that, but--
Speaker 1: So, what can you tell me about your mother's background?  What do you know about?
Speaker 2: Well, she was a very loving woman and very caring.  And she grew up in Greenville, although she was born just outside--I think it was Long's Switch [Mississippi].  Those were those little, you know, cotton communities off of, in the Delta [Mississippi River Delta].  And she grew up in Greenville for the most part, went to Greenville high schools, played basketball, was a star basketball player, one of her claims to fame, but perhaps the most is the rearing of her four children.  And she was a very wonderful woman.
Speaker 1: So, did your mom have any siblings?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did have siblings--my aunt who--and they were always together.  They raised us together, my Aunt Sammy Hollands [ph.], and, and my Uncle Billy, Walter Green, who lived in Detroit [Michigan] for most of his years after the war [World War II, WWII], after he had come back from the war.
Speaker 1: So, your mom had two siblings--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --that you were very close to.
Speaker 2: Well, actually, a half-brother, too, Uncle Charles, yes.
Speaker 1: So, what do you remember about your grandmother, your mother's mother?  What was her name?
Speaker 2: I did not know my mother's mother.  I didn't have the opportunity to meet.  Mary Green was her name, yeah, and Walter Green, the grandfather.
Story_ID: 297103
Speaker 1: So, let's talk then about your father.  Your father's name?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Jake Turnbull [Jr.] and he was a junior.  Grandpa was Jake Turnbull, Sr., yeah.
Speaker 1: So what can you--what do you remember about your father?  What type of man was he?
Speaker 2: Very gentle and wonderful.  I only got a whipping once from him (laughter).  I remember that, but my dad was a gentleman, and he fished a lot.  He was known for going fishing.  And he was a mechanic--the part that I could not really be a part of because I hated getting my hands greasy.  And then, my brother, Sam [Turnbull], was really, really into it a lot, you know.  But certainly, I learned a lot, you know, about cars, and knowing exactly what to do with the old cars that we had to, to putter around in.
Speaker 1: So, did you know your father's mother?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My father's mother, Grandma Francis [Turnbull], wonderful Grandma Francis, and, and she was just very loving, and of her children and, and her grandchildren.
Speaker 1: And your grandfather on your father's side?
Speaker 2: And my grandfather as well.  Papa Jake was a very wonderful man.
Speaker 1: So, do you know anything at all, collectively, about the origin of your family?  How, how far back--I mean, I know in the book ['Lift Every Voice: Expecting the Most and Getting the Best from All of God's Children,' Dr. Walter Turnbull and Howard Manly] you talk about it a little.
Speaker 2: Just a little (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What can you share with us today?
Speaker 2: --just a little bit that, that was there and a, the--my grandfather, my father's father, they grew up in and around Greenville [Mississippi] as, as well, you know, one of the little communities out.  And, and they were farmers, croppers, sharecroppers, you know, not wealthy, not, you know, well-off to do, but with great values.  And my grandma was a great cook.  I remember once when I was a little boy, they laughed and teased me about this until, you know, I was, you know, in graduate school [Manhattan School of Music, New York, New York].  They talked about making sweet potato pie and I love sweet potato pie.  And, of course, they made sweet potato pie.  And grandma took it out of the oven and I wanted a piece.  She said, "It has to cool."  And I said, "But my momma [Lena Green Turnbull] never lets it cool," (laughter).  I didn't really know that, but they laughed at me forever about the cooling of the sweet potato pie.
Story_ID: 297104
Speaker 1: What else can you tell me about your early years growing up in Greenville, Mississippi?  Let's start with the, the neighborhood you grew up in.
Speaker 2: Well, we, we grew up on Delta Street and Alexander [Street].  I remember when my mother [Lena Green Turnbull] and father [Jake Turnbull, Jr.] separated.  It was just two blocks away from where he was to where we moved to, in a house that was owned by my Aunt Sammy.  And then, we were living right next door to her.  And, and it was a very, you know, to come back with all of these memories is very, very kind of difficult because, you know, I don't linger there.  But I remember a lot about my, my childhood and growing up in school.  School was very special.  It was particularly--when we started going to--at first, to Manning to--they call it Melissa Manning now, School [Melissa Manning Elementary School, Greenville, Mississippi], but, but I was--I remember my fourth grade year with Ms. [Melissa] Manning and in the school, in the Manning School [Julia Armstrong Elementary School, Greenville, Mississippi].  And then, we went to the Seventh-day Adventist day school [Ephesus Seventh-day Adventist School, Greenville, Mississippi], where we were all in one classroom through the eighth grade.  And then, from there to, to Coleman High School [Coleman Middle School, Greenville, Mississippi].  And--
Speaker 1: Well, let's start with first grade and we'll, we'll do school in sort of chronological order.  Do you remember first grade at all?
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember first grade.
Speaker 1: You said your recollection starts at the fourth grade?
Speaker 2: Third grade--
Speaker 1: Third grade.
Speaker 2: --Ms. Gardner [ph.], and there really was a third and fourth grade.
Speaker 1: So, what stands out for you about Ms. Gardner in third and fourth grade?
Speaker 2: Well, and she insisted on us doing well, and being really basically good citizens--"Do unto others," et cetera, and all of that.
Speaker 1: So, in the fourth--third and fourth grade, she--you--she--you would consider her one of your favorite teachers?
Speaker 2: Ms. Manning, in fact, was my favorite teacher in the fourth grade.  I've never forgotten her.  To this day, I can remember the classroom.  I can remember the discipline.  I can remember the time tables around the wall.
Speaker 1: Can you describe the classroom for me?
Speaker 2: I just remember the time tables around the wall.  I don't remember, you know, much else about the room.
Speaker 1: What made her your favorite teacher?  What was it about her that inspired you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was just--I don't, I think she was very kind, but stern.  I think I've, I've gained a lot from, from remembering how she dealt with students.  Students were always expected to do what they were supposed to do.  And she was very, very much a stickler for, for detail, as I remember--a very wonderful, very wonderful lady.
Speaker 1: And they named the school after her?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you know her history at all?  I mean, is she--she'd been a black educator (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I don't know Ms. Manning's history, but she did know my family.  My uncle apparently, at one time, was a very close friend of her daughter, and we knew that.  She knew my family.  She knew my aunt [Sammy Green].  She knew my mother.  Now, did she teach my mother?  Apparently, she had taught my mother as I remember, yeah, she taught my mother.  You know, that kind of continuity and consistency ends one in one's life.  It's so important because of the development of character, expectations by everybody around you, and that's the difference.  That makes a kid secure.  And a kid secure is a kid who can do good things, great things, as a matter of fact.
Story_ID: 297105
Speaker 1: Moving to--out of fourth and fifth grade, and you went to the Seventh-day Adventist church--or school [Ephesus Seventh-day Adventist School, Greenville, Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was that experience like?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a--well, of course, it was in--by that time, into adolescence, so very, very different.  And, we would walk to school all the way across town to the south end (laughter), and it was a one-room schoolhouse.  It was very orderly and we had almost a different teacher every year who taught all of those grades, so one, a real one-room schoolhouse, but I think we were successful.
Speaker 1: Anything about those years that stands out for you, anything you can remember about Greenville [Mississippi] during that time that stands out for you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there were, there were friends like Flora [ph.], and John Sear [ph.], and Carolyn Crawford [ph.] (laughter).  And, you know, as we got older, you know, we all sort of hung out together.  I mean, what was there to do in Greenville (laughter)?  But some very, very close, good friends, and because we all went to the same church, you know, so we--
Speaker 1: What church did you go to?
Speaker 2: The Ephesus Seventh-day Adventist Church [Greenville, Mississippi], yeah.  That, that was--well, and when I came to New York [New York], I discovered an Ephesus [Ephesus Seventh-day Adventist Church, New York, New York], and that's where I went (laughter).
Story_ID: 297106
Speaker 1: So what type of a child were you, from your recollection?  Were you quiet?  Were you mischievous, or mischievous, were you--
Speaker 2: I was not mischievous.  I was more serious.  I was more serious probably because I was the oldest.  And as my (unclear) once said--and I couldn't be a child.  I had to take care of my brothers and sisters because mother [Lena Green Turnbull] had to work.  And then, this was during the time when after--I mean, we were just my mother and us.  And I really was a very serious kid and took care of my brothers and sisters, and made sure that they did all of their homework and all of their chores.
Speaker 1: What type of a student were you in school?
Speaker 2: A pretty good student, I think, a pretty good student.  I always considered myself--I thought I was a little, after years of, later years, I thought I was a little naive (laughter).  And I was, I was, yeah, a little naive about people, about life, about religion, and how it really fit into our lives, and what influence it had on our lives.  And it had a lot of influence on my life.  Because I was serious, I think that I took everything literally, and not always the best, I don't think, at this point, in my growth and development in terms of being a, a man.
Story_ID: 297107
Speaker 1: So we'll move, keep moving forward, and you get to Coleman High School [Coleman Middle School, Greenville, Mississippi].  What year did you enter high school?
Speaker 2: What year did I enter high school?  Well, I graduated in 1962 so--
Speaker 1: So, we'll take four years back--
Speaker 2: Back, yeah--
Speaker 1: --oh, yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: --right.  And, oh, those were really some great years because one of the reasons why I went to Coleman--not because it was the only school there, but high school.  But I'd heard of Ms. Jones [ph.] and wanted to sing.  And it was just an, an accident, I think, that I just got a chance to sing because we, we went to a class.  We were all in the class and, of course, Ms. Jones was playing 'My Country, 'Tis of Thee,' or something, and everybody had to sing, yeah.  And she said, "You should be in the choir."  Just like that.  And, but you see, I had sung in church [Ephesus Seventh-day Adventist Church, Greenville, Mississippi].  Church was a very important part of our lives.
Speaker 1: How so?
Speaker 2: And we sang in church a lot.  We sang in church a lot--that group of people that I mentioned-Flora [ph.] and Johnny [John Sear (ph.)] and Jean [ph.], and all of us, you know, hung together.  So, everybody sang, so we would sing then.  And what I realized much later about that, that soprano voice, I had a soprano voice at that time and, and would just pray to God that it would never change (laughter).  I remember that, so but as I, I grew and, and developed, singing became extraordinarily important to me, and at--
Speaker 1: Coleman.
Speaker 2: --Coleman, it was the thing.
Speaker 1: So, at what age would you say you developed this singing voice?  So, when did you realize you were a good singer (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, it was always, had been started even as--
Speaker 1: In church?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at, at church as, as an unchanged voice, as a, a soprano, as, as boys are.  And, but it always was there, you know, it, it always was there.
Story_ID: 297108
Speaker 1: So, I know Coleman High School [Coleman Middle School, Greenville, Mississippi] is--has a great reputation for being one of the best, like legally segregated schools ever.  Can you talk about the, can you just talk about Coleman High School--the teachers that were there?  What, what did they instill in you?  What was your school like?
Speaker 2: As, you know, with the wisdom that has come in years, I thought, I think back that they were, there was a strong sense of being very proud of who you were.  There was no need to not embrace your blackness.  There was, there was a constant helping, and people helping us, giving us--I mean, there were teachers at Coleman High School that really, really--I think, changed my life.  I think Mr. Young [ph.] and--
Speaker 1: Can you talk about, individually, what those people gave you, like, for instance, Mr. Young?  How did he help change (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was the biology, biology teacher.  At, at one time, I thought I would be a biologist.  And he was very serious about the, the work and he challenged us all the time--that I liked about Mr. Young.  And the other gentleman, I just can't remember his name, Mr.--but he was a great teacher, as was Ms. Etta Crawford, my English teacher, and as was, of course, Herticene Jones which had a major influence on my life.  I mean, major influence on my life.
Speaker 1: Let's talk about Herticene Jones (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Once, once I started to sing--Herticene was everything.  Now, everything was centered around Herticene and, of course, she was very--she had high standards and, and those expecting, expecting the best.  I mean, and you could not, not try.  You could not, not be the best because she expected the best.  That's a good teacher.  And she was very, very--
Speaker 1: Can you remember assemblies or people?  Can you remember instances where you assembled to sing or people that came to the school to sing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember the Christmas program once singing, and (singing) "What child is this who laid to rest," ['What Child Is This?'].  I sang that solo, and I remember one of my other teachers, Ms. Duncan [ph.] who said, "Oh, I didn't know you could sing like that, Walter Jake [HistoryMaker Walter Turnbull]."  And sort of after that, so, there was somewhat of a reputation as a singer so, which developed, and I enjoyed because singing was it.
Speaker 1: Did Ms. Jones have the opportunity to see what you would later do in your life?
Speaker 2: I'm very happy that she was able to.  When I brought the Boys Choir of Harlem to Greenville, Mississippi, and she could see my work and what I had done, and over the years through college, you know, she would come down to Tougaloo [Tougaloo College, Tougaloo, Mississippi] for our performances because Tougaloo did wonderful performances.  And the, there was one, particularly, the 'Messiah' [George Frideric Handel] every year, you know, so, I mean that was an event.  And Ms. Jones, I would always, you know, when I would come home, say hello to Ms. Jones when I would come home from college.  She was very, very, very supportive.
Speaker 1: So, before you moved out of Coleman High School and into Tougaloo, do you remember any other teachers?  Did you have any, ever, did you have any contact with Mr. [Roy P.] Huddleston who was at--the band director?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Mr. Huddleston, who was right next door, because the choir and the music room was right next door.  And Mr. Huddleston lived down the street from me, three houses down.  And he was just, he was one of those men who had high standards as well.  And his band was number one, as was our choir (laughter)--every time you'd go to state competition.  I think that having--I came from a very fine tradition of musicians who had high standards, didn't settle for anything less.  And I think that has stood me in great stead throughout my life.  Even before I had the equipment to deal as a, as a musician, I had standards.  And that's how it starts--it was those high standards, expectations of yourself, and others.
Speaker 1: So, can you remember the Christmas program that the choir used to always put on, the Living Christmas Tree?
Speaker 2: Oh, where was--in Greenville?
Speaker 1: In Greenville--were you a part of that?
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't remember a lot about that, you know, maybe that tradition happened more like, after me (laughter).  But it, it was wonderful.
Story_ID: 297109
Speaker 1: So, moving in 1962, you graduated Coleman High School [Coleman Middle School, Greenville, Mississippi]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and you went to Tougaloo [College, Tougaloo, Mississippi] on a music scholarship?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Can you talk to me about the process of who helped you get the scholarship, to cultivate it, and to get into school to get yourself set up at Tougaloo University [sic.]?
Speaker 2: It was clear that me being very poor, as we were, and was just my mother [Lena Green Turnbull] who was a domestic.  We were only going to get to college (cough) excuse me, if we found some way to work or, or to get scholarship.  I was, by that time, very known for my singing.  And so, it, it was like during those days, choir scholarships were like football scholarships or like basketball scholarships--sports being, you know, extremely important in, in our communities.  I auditioned for Mississippi Valley State [Mississippi Vocational College; Mississippi Valley State University, Itta Bena, Mississippi], and got offered a full scholarship.  I, I auditioned for Arkansas State [Arkansas State College; Arkansas State University, Jonesboro, Arkansas], and got full scholarship.  And Pops Lovelace [Ariel "Pops" Lovelace], as he was called, the choir man at Tougaloo, heard me and offered me a scholarship.  And it was not quite full, but then, when he heard that (laughter) that there were Mississippi Valley State and Arkansas A&M [Arkansas Agricultural and Mechanical College; University of Arkansas at Monticello, Monticello, Arkansas] really gave me offer full of--he came and said no, you got to come to Tougaloo, you got to come.  You know, it was really something trying to get it solved to school.
Speaker 1: What was his name?  What did you, what did they call him, Papa Lo- (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Pop, Pops.
Speaker 1: Pops, Pops Lovelace.
Speaker 2: Yes, great guy, had a lot of class.  He was a very fine musician, and always had a wonderful air about him of, of jovial, he was jovial, you know, and wisecracking.  So, he was a wonderful guy.
Story_ID: 297110
Speaker 1: During those years, like your late high school [Coleman High School; Coleman Middle School, Greenville, Mississippi] years and just say, your first year at Tougaloo [College, Tougaloo, Mississippi], who inspired you musically?  What type of music were you listening to as a teen and in young adult (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, interesting, yeah.  I remember listening a lot to classical music.  Now, why?  Basically because trying to be the good Christian, and not listening to that radio stuff.  I mean, they were, you know, the, the church had a big influence on, on us because we were totally involved in the church with our mother [Lena Green Turnbull].  So, well, then the best thing would be--I guess to go to, to listen to classical music.  So, all of those classical records that some of the teachers, who lived with us--some roomed in our home--young teachers.  They might have belonged to the record club, Columbia [House], or whatever those record clubs are, RCA [Record Club; BMG Direct Marketing, Inc.], blah, blah, blah.  And they would get these records as a part of the package, and some of them would be classical, and they would give them to me.  So, I began to listen to that a lot.  I remember the [George] Gershwin and how much I enjoyed the 'Rhapsody in Blue,' and all of that kind of stuff, so I began to acquire a taste.  By that time also, I was studying piano with Ms. [Herticene] Jones and so, you know, the classical repertory was, was something that I began to enjoy.
Story_ID: 296991
Speaker 1: You were ending, or you were talking about you--your mother's [Lena Green Turnbull] house, in some of the teachers' room with you, and they--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --were part of the record club, and the music that you were seen to listen to?
Speaker 2: Yes, often they were, they were members of a record club-Columbia [House], RCA [Record Club; BMG Direct Marketing, Inc.], whatever.  And when they would have a classical piece in the, in the offering, they would give it to me (laughter).  And I would listen, and I was always very on to the classical music.  And the one that I remember most immediately was 'Rhapsody in Blue,' the [George] Gershwin, and all the--so, from, from very early time, and some [Johann Sebastian] Bach, even some Bach.  But an introduction to classical music was sort of, you know, in high school [Coleman High School; Coleman Middle School, Greenville, Mississippi], you know.
Speaker 1: So, what was the repertoire like of songs that you sang in high school with Herticene Jones like (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh--
Speaker 1: What type of music do you sing?  Do you sing gospel music?  Do you--
Speaker 2: You know, I don't ever remember singing one gospel piece during high school (laughter).  And I know that that's what they mostly sing these days.  But we--either we, we, it was the regular, regular choral repertory.  And then, there were the spirituals, which we did, and wonderful spirituals-'Elijah Rock,' 'Ezekiel Saw the Wheel,' '[There is a] Balm in Gilead,' you know, just hundreds, hundreds of wonderful pieces, and then some light affair, like 'Autumn Leaves' and, you know, things like that, and really fun stuff.
Speaker 1: Now, is this music still flooding around today?  Do you use, still use some of this music--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, you hear it sometimes, you know, and, and with the young composer, Moses [George] Hogan, who passed, you know, a couple of years ago.  He had brought back the spiritual in those old tunes and, and everything.  As the Boys Choir of Harlem has developed over the years, I've always done those pieces.  I have taught them, 'Ezekiel Saw the Wheel.'  I've taught them, you know, 'Elijah Rock.'  I've just taught them, you know, a lot, 'Ride on King Jesus,' a lot of the spirituals.  Part of it was because of what I remembered, and what I enjoyed growing up.  Another part of it was being older and having wisdom about what is happening to our music.  Was--it was important to me to give my kids, these kids, black kids, the opportunity to know what's their music.  Right now, they don't, they don't understand what their music is.  So, they were not embracing spirituals--not because they might have considered them, you know, old-fashioned or dull.  They just were not embracing it because they didn't realize how important it was to their lives.  They didn't realize that it was their music, and that's a part of being successful, feeling good about yourself.  So, I, I needed to, to do that, so all those spirituals that I sang when I was a kid, I brought to my kids.
Story_ID: 296992
Speaker 1: So, you're at Tougaloo [College, Tougaloo, Mississippi].  Pops [Ariel "Pops" Lovelace] gives you a full scholarship.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: What is life like at Tougaloo College in 1962?
Speaker 2: For me, a wonderful time.  Tougaloo years are very wonderful for me--all centered around singing, but college life, the freedom of college life, the responsibility, you know.  Now, it was truly, if you were responsible, you could do things.  You could enjoy even more.  I was, at one point, vice president of the student body and then, later, president of the student body.  I was important in the choir as a soloist because Pops used me as a soloist often.  And I spent lots of time in the music department, but I think all of my classes were quite wonderful.  I, I guess I've always had a zest for learning, you know, always wanted to learn.  I enjoyed learning.
Speaker 1: So you said something interesting that I want you to talk about.  You said college life was great, or really good.  What was--how would you describe college life in the '60s [1960s], at a historically black university [HBCU]?
Speaker 2: College in the '60s [1960s]--we were all going in the same direction, all recognizing that, as young black men and young black women, we had a responsibility.  And it was particularly heightened by the movement [Civil Rights Movement], and we all became involved.  But there was a raison d'etre, you know.  We had something to believe in, and to work for.  And so, and that was that at Tougaloo.  There was particularly that kind of freedom.  You know, Tougaloo was considered the Cancer College by [Governor] Ross Barnett.  Tougaloo was a place where all kinds of people met and were together, black and white.  And it was a very special time.  Everybody was concerned about everybody.  So, it was the sense of family that was supportive of everybody, too.
Speaker 1: Now, this is in the '60s [1960s].  Mississippi has a turbulent past in the '60s [1960s].  You said you were involved.  How involved were you in the po- in civil rights in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Not as involved as a lot of other people (laughter), but involved to the extent that I would go to, you know, a demonstration or two, but more involved in the spirit of what we were trying to accomplish.  Tougaloo was the haven, you know.  You know, you could be on that campus and feel, well, not particularly safe, relatively.  We did have to run the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK] off the--from front of the president's house once.  I remember that.
Speaker 1: Tell me that story.
Speaker 2: We were having--I think our--some ball.  And they put a, you know, start bringing a cross in front of the president's house.  And there we were, all running down the road, you know, to try to run the people away--run those guys away, 'cause we, we were involved.  There was always high drama.  They would come along County [Line] Road, and shoot into the faculty homes that were along County Road.  It was always some drama.  But Tougaloo was--you didn't go off the campus.  I you know, as I, years later, when I would be--go to Tougaloo, or everybody had cars (laughter).  Every student had a car--we didn't have any cars.  I mean, we'd have to hitch a ride over to, you know (laughter).  No, we didn't have cars.  So, but I always, I always was fascinated by, ah, how things have changed.

Speaker 1: One thing that I didn't talk about that I would like to mention that happened when you were a child to see if you have any recollection of it, or to see what you remember.  So, we're going to jump back for a moment--is in May '55 [1955], Emmett Till was killed--oh, August '55 [1955] August (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I remember that vividly, I remember it, it--
Speaker 1: How can you remember it vividly?  What do you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, because, as a young black men, every, every parent, every aunt--I remember my aunt [Sammy Green] saying, you know, "Now, don't you be going out there looking at these white girls," you know, admonishing because I remember that.  It was, it was devastating.  It was frightening.  I remember, I remember it very well.  It colored what you did to survive.  And as I have become older and understood how we, as Africans in this country, survived the middle passage, survived slavery and Jim Crow.  It was because we had that other sense of how to survive.  You didn't give up your being of who you knew you were, but you adjusted.  People are not so willing to adjust these days.  It's, for me, it's be a little smarter.  And I look at that and compare.  And you know, and I, and I often tell my children, you know, we have millions of your ancestors on the floor of the Atlantic [Ocean], and you're talking about giving up?  You don't have a right to give up.  You do not have that right.  It's important that we keep our children reminded of who they are and under what circumstances they came here, and move forward.  The circumstances did not keep black folk in this country from advancing, advancing, and doing better than lots of folks who had opportunity.  That's a part of our heritage, that's a part of our heritage.
Story_ID: 296994
Speaker 1: Continuing to talk about Mississippi in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: We talked about Emmett Till.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Were there other things that you've felt shaped who you are in your, in your, in the way you see the plight of Africans, African Americans that came of the '60s [1960s] in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: I think that the movement [Civil Rights Movement] itself really helped to shape--it helped me to, to--al-, although I felt good about myself, I never felt, you know, somehow less because my teachers never let me do that, or my parents [Lena Green Turnball and Jake Turnbull, Jr.].  But putting it in context, the movement began to put into context what had to be done.  It also put in and instilled that everybody can do something, although that was one of Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] mantras that everybody can be important in some way.  And that kind of, you know, thought pervaded my goings and comings over the next fifty years because never being afraid to be who you are.  I mean, you can--so, when I'm in front of a group of kids, and I'm doing African American music, I'm not afraid of it.  I'm not and I'm not, and I, and I'm proud of it.  Having to be in a position that can say whether, you know, let's say, gangster rap is done or not done, and understanding the context in this society, which they want to view you, would determine whether or not I would do that.  There's not enough of that understanding perhaps for many people as a reason why you do or do not.  There has to be some discipline.  You don't just do everything because it's there.  We have to be more wise in terms of who we are, and what we're trying to go, we're reaching to reach.  You know, it might be, it might be--that's me.  It might be, you know, a little bit, a little bit--I guess (laughter), what we would call it fuddy when we were young (laughter), you know.  But that's what I believe.
Story_ID: 296995
Speaker 1: So, do you remember when James Meredith was--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, I was at Tougaloo [College, Tougaloo, Mississippi] (laughter) when James Meredith--
Speaker 1: You met him?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't, no (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay.  You remember James Meredith?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.
Speaker 1: You were at Tougaloo?
Speaker 2: I was at Tougaloo.  And when all of that happened and the Birmingham [Alabama], okay, I think I was there, too, but I don't know where I was there.  But when all of those things happened, I, I remember many things about the movement [Civil Rights Movement] and, and things that were happening.
Speaker 1: What do you remember about Meredith trying to get into Ole Miss [University of Mississippi, Oxford, Mississippi]?  And what did you think about it at the time?
Speaker 2: I thought it was something that had to be done.  I never got the sense that, oh, he should not be making trouble.  I never felt that.  I was some--and with all of the others--things that happened, you know, people taking their stand, you know.  I know that, in wisdom, how important it was.  Then, I didn't know, but I wasn't critical of it, I wasn't, I wasn't critical of it.  It was something that had to be done.  And so, it needed to be supported--if not physically--spiritually.
Story_ID: 296996
Speaker 1: Can you remember--in Tougaloo [College, Tougaloo, Mississippi], you said you were the student body president.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Or, well, let's start with--you or, initially, what was the first office you had?
Speaker 2: Vice president--
Speaker 1: Vice president.
Speaker 2: --chief justice, they call it, so you had to, to judge fellow students.
Speaker 1: How did that come about?  How did you receive such a prestigious office and at Tougaloo (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, there were elections, there were elections--entire student body.
Speaker 1: So, did you go from being serious to someone--were you as serious in college as you had been in, when you needed to be as young adult kid, sort of in Mississippi, or did you lighten up in college because perhaps you could?
Speaker 2: I began to lighten up, I began to lighten up.
Speaker 1: In lightening up, gave you opportunities to do what--that you had not been able to do in--
Speaker 2: Spend more time with the girls, (laughter), and just be, you know, part of the gang, you know, I suppose.
Speaker 1: How important do you feel it was for you to learn the ability to function in a leadership role such as vice president, such as president?
Speaker 2: Because I was always kind of serious, kind of serious, serious-minded, and a stickler for detail and order.  I didn't find it a problem at all.  So I, you know, fell right into, to line.  But as I'm older, and I began to think about being elected in such a position, obviously, other kids saw in my person someone that they felt they could trust, someone who was basically honest and dealt really from the heart.  I've always dealt from the heart.  I didn't know this, but that's from my mother [Lena Green Turnbull].  As I'm older, and wisdom, you know, seeps in, you know what, what's really--that's why I'm like that, you know.
Speaker 1: What do you consider to be the highlights of your life during your years at Tougaloo (unclear)?
Speaker 2: The highlights of my life at Tougaloo were to be able to sing and solo.  This was as I begin to sing solo, and the great respect that I got from teachers and students.  It was a lot of respect.  And I felt I had something, you know, I had a voice, you know, and that was what I was known for.  That was--I wasn't known for my academics although I didn't have bad grades.  I did graduate cum laude (laughter), but that was not particularly my forte.  My forte was singing--that was it.
Story_ID: 296997
Speaker 1: How did that singing, how did--I guess I want you to take me from graduation in Tougaloo [College, Tougaloo, Mississippi], and you'd only been in Mississippi, to getting to one of the greatest cities on earth, New York City [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Yeah, (cough), excuse me.  Easy--while at Tougaloo, we were always hanging around at the social science lab with Dr. [Ernst] Borinski.  And for the summers, we wanted to look for things to do that was going to, and I--
Speaker 1: That was going to--?
Speaker 2: --improve us in our particular fields.  So, for example, many kids who were sociologists went to, to some schools where, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did internships some place?
Speaker 2: Interns, right.  I found Chautauqua Institute [Chautauqua Institution, Chautauqua, New York].  And Chautauqua is one of the great summer music institutes.  It was a lot of other things--reading and poetry, and all those things.
Speaker 1: We're--you're going to have to spell that for me.
Speaker 2: Chautauqua, C-H-A-T-A-U-Q-U-A [sic.].
Speaker 1: Chautauqua Institute?
Speaker 2: Chautauqua.  Chautauqua Institute--it started off as a colony of people, religious people, you know.  And they'd be, in every summer, they would go there.  And there was reading and poetry, and some of the greats, you know, the great figures and scholars, you know, all went there.  But they had a music institute all connected with that, and opera, and symphony, and blah, blah, blah.  It just so happens that Borinski knew that the chairman of our board, the Wilders had a home on the grounds of Chautauqua.  And so, I applied to Chautauqua, got accepted in the music school of Chautauqua, was very close friends of the Wilders and their children, and had a wonderful musical experience at Chautauqua, where I met Josephine Antoine who was going to be teaching at the, was teaching at the Eastman School of Music [Rochester, New York].  And there were all kinds of musicians and all.  I met a lot of musicians and people who were in the business now when we were just kids at Chautauqua.
Speaker 1: Can you name some of them?
Speaker 2: Uh, God, who?  A lot, maybe not a lot that were famous.
Speaker 1: But just name some of them for the sake of this oral history.
Speaker 2: Yes, it's--what's his name?  Sandusky, Ohio, I saw her way--came from--Monte [ph.].  Anyway, that's all I remember is Monte and, and I can see them all (laughter).
Speaker 1: I get you, I get (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I can't remember, but they were musicians.  And I met some of them when I came to New York.  So, anyway, I was actually talk--
Speaker 1: Let me--just before you go on, is Chautauqua in Mississippi or New, New York?
Speaker 2: In New York State--
Speaker 1: It's New York State, okay.
Speaker 2: --outside of Jamestown, New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I travelled to Chautauqua for two summers straight, and learned a lot about music, and the, the whole business of--heard orchestras.  Really, come to think about it for the first time live--the Chautauqua Symphony [Orchestra], yeah.  I didn't have money to go to Chautauqua, but I worked when I got there.  I was giving a bathroom cleaning job.  So, all of the bathrooms around the campus, I had to clean, and did it well--was constantly, needed money, like most students--made lots of friends.  And Chautauqua was very important for me as a musician.  And I met people, and then, looked at things in places that I would want to go to graduate school.
Story_ID: 296998
Speaker 1: So, at that time when you were going to Chautauqua [Institution, Chautauqua, New York] over the summers, what sort of career did you envision for yourself in the music industry?
Speaker 2: As a singer--a career as a singer.
Speaker 1: What type of a singer?
Speaker 2: Classical singer.
Speaker 1: A classical singer?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this is gonna sound dumb--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: --but I've had to ask because I didn't--who, outside of Paul Robeson, who could you look at that were also black classical musicians that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There weren't very many, ohh.
Speaker 1: --that you--
Speaker 2: I knew of Marian Anderson.  I knew of Leontyne Price.  I knew of Bill Warfield [HistoryMaker William Warfield].  I knew of, you know, of a Shirley Verrett.  And Reri Grist, and, you know, there were not many.  But I was never, I was never spurred by because somebody else was.  It was because I wanted to, so I was never necessarily looking for that until later years, you know, but I was never looking for that.  It was whatever I wanted to do because I thought I could do it.  I didn't realize the racism, the roadblocks, and all of those kinds of things.  And they were there, they were there, and I experienced them at Chautauqua, and through every music school that I've ever attended.
Speaker 1: So you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It is not, it's like--well, who are you to be in this business?  I, I am sure that blacks all over this country have experienced that in whatever they wanted to do.  That's the nature of the game.  So, can you stay strong, and still pursue that career?  Can you stay strong despite--oh, I remember in New York [New York]--I shall never forget for High Holy Days, everybody got a sun god gig in the early fall.  And they would send us from the Mannes School of Music [Mannes College of Music; Mannes School of Music, New York, New York], young singers to go audition.  And they sent me to audition.  The guy took one look and said, "You can't, you can't do it."  And I was furious, I was angry.  That was--I didn't even get a chance to sing.  I'll never forget that.  And I called, furious, back to the placement office--I said, well, "Why?"  You know, I didn't say why you didn't send me. I said, "The guy wouldn't accept me because I was black."  "Oh, I'm sorry, don't, don't worry about it, you know, we'll find something for you."  But I, because his synagogue, everybody was what could be seen in his particular synagogue.  They were not behind, you know, as in some synagogues-everybody could be seen, and to see me would not be good apparently.  Yeah, went to the Anthonie Hotel [ph.] to audition.  He took, look--one--took one look and said, "You cannot go and sing in my synagogue."  I remember well.
Story_ID: 296999
Speaker 1: You can tell the story, and then we'll go on (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, the altar boy choir has been long in develop, long in development.  I had to learn the altar boy choir.  I knew singing, but I didn't know the altar boy choir, which is how the voices were--what happens to them.  And I know all of that now.  And, and, and I can, I can teach someone to do, to, to, to understand that, and, of course, to teach those voices.  Now, I've developed a method at the Boys Choir of Harlem that is strictly, you know, bringing them from eight years old through fifteen.  See--that's a change, that is a time when the voice starts to change for a boy.  And so, he has to sing differently, and certain things has to happen.  And I've developed that method.  I'm in the process now of trying to--and, and I'm putting it down and copyrighting it because people all the country are asking me about how to do it in their cities, so more than that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So to--
Story_ID: 297000
Speaker 1: Move back a little bit, and then we'll catch back up.  Chautauqua [Institution, Chautauqua, New York], '66 [1966], '67 [1967], you did the two internships.  You graduate Tougaloo [College, Tougaloo, Mississippi].  You decide that you've got to do something.  What do you decide to do next?
Speaker 2: Go to graduate school.  Of course, at Tougaloo, everybody was on the same--it seemed, on the same direction, you know.  It was about education.  And so, nobody did not want to go.  And I was a part of that, that groupie, you know, didn't want to go on to higher education.  And so, I started applying to various graduate schools, Eastman School of Music [Rochester, New York] being one, and went all the way to Dallas, Texas.  BoBo [ph.] got me--Dr. [Ernst] Borinski--got me money to go by train to Dallas, Texas for an audition for the [The] Juilliard School [New York, New York].  And an audition for the Eastman School, of course, at Chautauqua because Josephine Antoine was--and I went.  No, I actually went up to Eastman, too, the Eastman School of Music.  Yeah, to Rochester [New York], and, and the Manhattan School of Music [New York, New York].  And that last summer, I auditioned at all of those places, and then, was accepted at the, the Manhattan School of Music.
Speaker 1: So, what, and this is just something small that I mentioned to you to know.  Do you remember what your audition piece was?  What did you audition with?
Speaker 2: I really don't remember.  Oh, yeah, 'Die Forelle' of [Franz] Schubert for one.
Speaker 1: Can you sing some of it or hum some of it?  How does it--
Speaker 2: (Humming).  Schubert, you know, Schubert--I mean, 'Die Forelle.'  And who else did I did--that, that I remember.
Speaker 1: So you accepted Manhattan--
Speaker 2: Yes, Manhattan School of Music, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) School of Music?
Speaker 2: And it was located on, on the east side, on East 103rd Street [sic. 105th Street].
Story_ID: 297001
Speaker 1: Now was this your first time in New York City [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What did you think about New York City in 1968 or '60-, let's say '67 [1967], '68 [1968]?  Coming--I mean, you literally were, it was, 'Cotton Comes to Harlem.'
Speaker 2: That--right (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Fabulous.  Well, it was just about, it was about experiences of actually living and going to church, and going to school.  That's all it was for me.
Speaker 1: You went to church in Harlem [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You continued at the Seventh-day Adventist?
Speaker 2: I found an Ephesus church [Ephesus Seventh-day Adventist Church, New York, New York] right down the street from where I lived.  I lived at International House [New York, New York], you know.  Of course, International House is this place that the Rockefellers had built upon that hill up, you know, where Riverside Church [New York, New York] is and all this.  And students, American students, who served as hosts for foreign students--and so your room and board, your room was free.  That's where I lived for two years for graduate school at the International House.  And right down the street on 23rd, 123rd Street, was the Ephesus Church, and that's where I began to go to church.  And I was very involved in the youth ministries and, you know, with kids.
Story_ID: 297002
Speaker 1: And that's where I started the Boys Choir of Harlem.  It was first called the Ephesus Church Choir [Ephesus Church Choir of Central Harlem].  And then, I incorporated it to the Boys Choir of Harlem.
Speaker 2: Why the name, Boys Choir of Harlem?
Speaker 1: I just thought it would be so grand--given that Harlem [New York, New York] had this wonderful tradition of music.  And, you know, for all the years, and it should be the Boys Choir of Harlem.  And so, when I mentioned that to the secretary, to the--the lady was a pianist--she said, "I don't want to have anything to do with the name Harlem."  She lived in Harlem.  I said--I put that in the book ['Lift Every Voice: Expecting the Most and Getting the Best from All of God's Children,' Dr. Walter Turnbull and Howard Manly], too.  And, of course, she got mad at me because I wrote that, but it's true.  It was--actually happened.
Speaker 2: So, you're at Manhattan School of Music [New York, New York]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You're attending church [Ephesus Seventh-day Adventist Church, New York, New York] on 123rd Street?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You implement a program for the church that becomes the Boys Choir of Harlem.
Speaker 1: That, yeah, that eventually becomes--
Speaker 2: Becomes the Boys Choir--so, you do this long before you graduate Manhattan School of Music?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, yes.  I had started it then.
Speaker 2: So, you were--talk to me about how you would make money as a musician.
Speaker 1: Well, perhaps not as a musician always, but the musician part, I sang in church services.  And one of the gigs I had was in Southport, Connecticut, as the third soloist, you know.  Everybody has a soloist.  And I would get on the train and trudge up to Southport.  But Southport was considered the Gold Coast--lots of very wealthy people.  And the Episcopal Church there had a boy choir, and that just even peaked to my interest even more in the altar boy choir.  On the side, I drove a cab.
Speaker 2: Wait, we're going, okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I want to go back to Connecticut and the Gold Coast.  This church was an Episcopal black church (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Unh-uh.
Speaker 2: It was a white church?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So, now, you were not working with black musicians per se anymore?
Speaker 1: Oh, not at all, no.
Speaker 2: Not at all?
Speaker 1: Not at all, not at all.  They were none around in that, in the--
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, you had seen this white Boys Choir--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and it peaked your interest?
Speaker 1: Peaked my interest because of the boy choir sound.  And about that time, the Berkshire Boy Choir was formed up at Tanglewood [Lenox, Massachusetts].  And the guests from England, you know, the authority on boys.  And, and they would bring the, the best Episcopal boys from around the country who would come to Tanglewood in the summer to have boy choir.  I heard their record, like all of that stuff, listened a lot, said, well, we should have a boy choir in Harlem.  And that's when I asked the church elders [at Ephesus Seventh-day Adventist Church, New York, New York], "Let me do a boy choir."  And I was--first time working with black boys.
Speaker 2: We're going to get to the taxi driving.  I just want to hang here for a moment.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: So, who were those first few boys?  Do you remember them--their names, how many was it, what was--
Speaker 1: About twenty.
Speaker 2: Twenty, that's a big number.
Speaker 1: People--no, not so big, because boys and, and the Adventist church always like to sing.  It was one of the few things we could do (laughter).  I remember that growing up, but it, and there were lots of them.  And I was very close to their parents, you know, so I knew them and they, they knew me.  And, and Michael Boone, I remember Michael, and his brother, Kenneth [Boone].  And Steven Odom, and Leroy Williams.  And there were, there were, there are a lot of them doing wonderful things now.  And they, you know, they started the tradition of this African American boy choir.
Story_ID: 297003
Speaker 1: So you will--so you leave Manhattan School of Music [New York, New York]--you finish there.  By now, you're fully inspired to, to put together a boy choir?
Speaker 2: Yes.  But I really wanted to pursue my career as a singer, so I kept doing that.  At the same time, I sang in the opera theatres around town.  At that time, Hunter College [New York, New York] had an opera theatre.  Brooklyn College [New York, New York] had an opera theatre.  Mannes College of Music [Mannes School of Music, New York, New York] had an opera theatre.  And I sang roles in all of those.  And there, when I began to get my chops as an opera singer, you know, began to get roles, and that's how you be--'cause you got to have that experience.  And I was doing that--at the same time, basically doing the boy choir on the weekend--Friday night rehearsal, Saturday after-church rehearsal, Sunday rehearsal.  And that's how the Boys Choir of Harlem started when I was still doing that.  And I was driving a cab on the side to make money.
Speaker 1: So, you're driving a cab, pursuing an opera career, and starting the choir.
Speaker 2: All of those things going simultaneously.  That of the--that, probably, is why, even today, I have such a hard time with relaxing, with being more considerate of my own health--all of those things.  That's what I'm dealing with at this point in my life.
Speaker 1: So, when you were starting the choir, and pursing opera as well, or getting work as an opera singer, did you have to go out then, and train to become an opera singer (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes--
Speaker 1: --or your training, you'd already received a sufficient--
Speaker 2: --so I had, yes, I had to train.  I had to have coaches.
Speaker 1: Who did you study with--any prominent, or people that had an impact on--
Speaker 2: Warren Wilson who lives in the building next door (laughter).  I was one of--but famous coaches.  There were several coaches, you know, other than Warren Wilson that I coached with.  I coached opera--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --or I--
Speaker 1: --go ahead, you coached opera.
Speaker 2: --or I, I studied with, I studied with [HistoryMaker] George Shirley who became a very good friend.  I studied with Dan Merriman, and Helen Vani--got something from each one of those and began to grow as a singer.
Speaker 1: Not that what I'm going to ask now--I just have to set this up--has anything to do with an oral history.  But it's peaked my curiosity per se, is the training you receive at a black institution in music different than that you were receiving when you were working with white institutions in music?
Speaker 2: I, I--not different, but a different bit.  We, in the black institution at Tougaloo [College, Tougaloo, Mississippi], the emphasis was on choral music.  So, that's the high school and college tradition I came from.  By the time I was at the conservatory, the emphasis was on, you know, an operatic career and, therefore, a slight difference.
Speaker 1: And there are not as many black people that were in that arena--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --to teach you.
Speaker 2: --exactly.  Not many in that, in the, because the classical music field is very--was and is--very racist--as simple as that.  First of all, you're black, just like they told Arthur Mitchell that black dancers couldn't dance.  Black people they aren't a supposed to sing classical--you couldn't--supposed to do jazz, if anything, and nothing but gospel.  So, having the children to understand historically where they are--why they should not just do one type of music is important because they want you to do just what you should be categorized to do.  You categorize to do black, or being gospel, hip-hop.  Classical?  So, the business has gotten better, you know, over the years, in terms of their acceptance of black people.  So, when people, like a [HistoryMaker] William Warfield had successes, or Leontyne Price had successes, you know, they were, because their life, and they were, you know, they'll, because of their life, and they won't, you know, just so much better than anything else.  They couldn't turn them down.  And then when George Shirley came along, a black man at the Metropolitan Opera--
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: George Shirley, well-known African American singer.
Story_ID: 297004
Speaker 1: Talking more, generally speaking about the arts in Harlem [New York, New York] at the time, you know, your focus was music, but you mentioned Arthur Miller, which is, not Arthur Miller--
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Arthur Mitchell--
Speaker 1: Arthur, Arthur Mitchell, in Dance Theatre of Harlem [New York, New York].  Collectively, were you guys thinking about black classical arts, generally speaking--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --in a movement when--
Speaker 2: It was what you wanted to do.  Arthur wanted to be a dancer, so he was a dancer.  And he wanted to be at the height of, of, as a dancer, so I mean classical ballet was it.  So, he did classical ballet, probably this is--look, what I'm thinking.  But for me, I wanted to be the finest singer I could be.  So, being an opera singer put all the things of theatre, and singing, and dance altogether, so I could pursue that.  And I had to go to acting school.  I went to HB Studios [HB Studio, New York, New York].  And I went to the speech classes and, you know, all of those extra things, which became very important.  And now, I see why, in wisdom and hindsight, why talking all of those things, and knowing all of that, has gone into the development of the Boys Choir [of Harlem] and these children.  But it was ordained--it was not just me.  I mean, my life has always been led by a fuller power that, many times, I would not acknowledge, or didn't know before I became more wise.  So, everything that I know about acting has been used with the Boys Choir of Harlem, but they, because they're choreographed, and really have whole sections of opera that, that are choreographed--singing and dancing and acting--the consummate artist, singer and dancer, actor.  Everything that I learned in opera--I've used so much for the Boys Choir of Harlem.
Speaker 1: What were some of your favorite roles in opera that you've had the opportunity to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I was a Rodolfo.  I was an Alfredo.  I was a Tamino.  I was in the operas, Tamino in 'Die Zauberflote' ['The Magic Flute,' Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart], and Alfredo in '[La] Traviata' [Giuseppe Verdi], and Rodolfo in 'La Boheme' [Giacomo Puccini].  Those were my--I'm, I'm a lyric.  And as I've gotten older, a little bit more spinto, but, you know, the voice basically is lyric.
Story_ID: 297005
Speaker 1: So, let's just go back to the early '70s [1970s].  Were you, you, you're, at what point do you, does the church [Ephesus Seventh-day Adventist, New York, New York] get enough momentum behind you for you to incorporate into the Boys Choir of Harlem?  What year are we talking about, and how did that come about?
Speaker 2: Sixty-eight [1968] is the year.  And it wasn't the church getting momentum behind me.  The church didn't want me to allow other Harlem [New York, New York] children to be a part of the choir.  Some people even said, "We don't want our boys to be with all those heathens."  I shall never forget these things.  If they, if we believed what it is that the--what the church really taught about bringing people in, that was the wrong thing, but I remember those things.  They didn't want me to do that.  So, I went forward to incorporate the Boys Choir of Harlem.  And I went to volunteer lawyers for the arts, and they incorporated it for me.  And then began the journey of the Boys Choir of Harlem.
Speaker 1: What are some of the steps in that journey along the way?  I mean, sort of, what were pinnacle moments in chronological order?  So, '68 [1968], you in-, incorporate.  That's the same year King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed.  Wasn't he killed in '68 [1968]?
Speaker 2: Hmm, I think it was.
Speaker 1: April 4, '68 [1968].  So, you incorporate the same year?
Speaker 2: Uh-hm.  And we rehearsed at the local community center because, by that time, the church had burned, and we had nowhere to rehearse.  And then, it was incorporated, and it was--we could invite kids from the community that wanted to be a part.
Speaker 1: So, if I can try to get behind the scenes of--in your head, what were you trying to create with these boys and this choir?
Speaker 2: I was trying to create a boy choir that was just as good as any of the boy choirs that I had heard because, obviously, they didn't think that we could do it.  So, was constantly in a state of learning how to do it.  And what I learned, on those years, have just been extraordinary in terms of how our sound is different, but no less legitimate.
Story_ID: 297006
Speaker 1: How is the sound different?
Speaker 2: It's warmer.  It's richer for the most part.  You know how you can hear someone on the radio, and you know they're black.  It's how you hear Leontyne [Price] singing--you know she's black.  Even Kathleen [Battle], you know she's black.  It's a, it's a difference in the warmth of the sound.  That's because of head structure for the most part--the, the bouncing of the sound, and all of that.  That's--so, it's that, and that plays a part.  The Boys Choir of Harlem sound is warmer than Vienna's [Vienna Boys Choir].  Vienna sounds specifically Viennese, which is a little brittle, has a little (unclear) to it.  Canterbury [Cathedral Choir] sounds different, England--it's a different sound.  Boys Choir of Harlem is different.  They're all distinct sounds.
Speaker 1: Are they all singing the same music?
Speaker 2: Yeah, can all be singing the same music.  It is no less legitimate because the sound is different, no less legitimate.  I can sing [Johann Sebastian] Bach "Hallelujahs" in 'Cantata No. 4.'  And my "Hallelujah" maybe says something different, but they're all "Hallelujahs" with all the things that musicians consider to be correct--pitched, you know, cultured sound, blah, blah, blah, and I've proved it, I have proved it.  It can be done.  So now, there are lots of black boy choirs around the country, or at least, people try to start black boy choirs.
Story_ID: 297007
Speaker 1: Before we get to those, I want to stay on this trail of how you have--I mean it's world-renowned.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: How did that, I mean it's--
Speaker 2: A lot of hard work and, an assistant--an insistence of standards from high school [Coleman High School; Coleman Middle School, Greenville, Mississippi], and insistence on not taking--it's not taking no.  It's, it's not giving up.
Speaker 1: So let--in nineteen--in the nineteen--late, late '70s [1970s], early '80s [1980s], you had gotten your legs underneath you with the Boys Choir [of Harlem], and you'd started to travel around.  And you started to receive acclaim.  What were some of the things that made a difference in the direction of keeping the choir moving forward in that critical acclaim?
Speaker 2: To get critical acclaim?
Speaker 1: Or, or the critical (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I'm saying, I'm answering you.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Upon of having critical acclaim is to be in the right place to get critical acclaim.  So, when people would ask us to perform at various venues, we would perform.  We would do things that were perhaps different--entertainment.  We sang [Duke] Ellington, okay.  We sang Thelonious Monk.  We sang all those kinds of jazz things that nobody else was doing--and then, we choreographed them.  Opportunities, you know, doing things creatively, which nobody else had done before, and that's how we be-, became.  I didn't know that there was show choirs.  You know, in later years, I realized that there are lots of show choirs out there.  The Boys Choir of Harlem was doing choreography from, from early, early years and do it.  And the reason I was doing, you know, Ellington and all of the greats was because that included, just like spirituals, they didn't know it was theirs.  It was all about teaching for me--apparently.  You know, I was an artist, but it was about teaching.  It's kind of this disjunct [ph.], isn't it?  It just--there was no one thing.  I would do whatever was necessary to make it happen.  That's called survival.  And it is what our ancestors had to do to make it in this country.  So, I've learned that as well in later years--wisdom after the fact, but I did it automatically.  So, there must be something there to race memory.  There's something in a people that comes out in what they do, and how they create that it's within them.  It's called race memory.  I believe that.  I don't know why we do what we do all the time.
Story_ID: 297008
Speaker 1: You started to receive awards and grants.  Yeah, I think you received the Heinz?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, personally, yes.  The Heinz Award [Heinz Award in the Arts and Humanities] was a great honor, nothing that I've ever, ever, dreamed I would get.
Speaker 1: What is the award and who receives it, and tell me, how did it come to you?
Speaker 2: Well, the Heinz Award--you're not, you cannot apply.  You are nominated--much like the MacArthur [Fellows Program].  And it's a cash award for you personally.  It came at a wonderful time for me because I had absolute--I was destitute.  The Boys Choir of Harlem did not make a whole lot of money.  It was hard to raise funds.  It was--and it helped me to get a little bit more settled.  I wish I had saved more because now at sixty-one (laughter), I don't have a pension from the Boys Choir of Harlem.  We've had very unfortunate situations with our board of directors that has not, from the beginning, been truly supportive and understood what it is that we do.  But we're more in tune to the fact that, "Oh, I'm on the Boys Choir of Harlem board."  One of the saddest aspects of this, of our existence, so much, so that today, we're in, you know, really deep financial strains, but we can't give up.
Story_ID: 297009
Speaker 1: You are, at this moment, very interested in talking about where we are.  So, we will go with that.  And we are talking about--and then we will digress, we will go back in time, but because it's at the forefront of your mind--talk about what you would like to with the Boys Choir of Harlem today.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, the Boys Choir of Harlem is a very tenuous position--not enough funds.  We've had deficits for a number of years.  We've had a board of directors that has not truly been in the best interests of the Boys Choir of Harlem because it seems like, it's just the fact of being a part of the famous Boys Choir of Harlem.  And so, we got into some difficulties, and those difficulties are largely around money.  In many cases, I think, and I might be a bit paranoid, but it don't mean they're out to get you just 'cause you're paranoid (laughter).  People are playing old-fashioned racism and, and, and jealousy--have played a part in Boys Choir of Harlem's inability to get on top as far as funding is concerned.  The one thing that has helped the Boys Choir of Harlem to survive is the fact that we can charge fees for services.  The Boys Choir of Harlem is the highest paid boy choir in the world.  Vienna [Boys Choir] gets ten thousand [dollars] a performers.  We get 17.5 to $25,000 per performance.  Why?  Because the Boys Choir of Harlem's performances are shows that start with classical music to spirituals.  And then, there's intermission, and then the second half is dancing, jazz, all kinds of stuff, gospel.  So, we're a show, we're, we're a show.  You can charge $25,000 for a show.  The Boys Choir of Harlem has recently had to lay off everybody for the most part.  And we're dealing with basically volunteers, and doing the performances now.  So, the organization part that developed into the executive and the controllers, the, and, and all that--those people are gone.  And we're having a very difficult time.  There was a time when we had not done all the audits.  Now, all audits have been done.  We're on the upswing.  There--we had some problem with the IRS [Internal Revenue Service], so that is, you know, offered compromise and, you know, we're dealing with, with all of that.  But that's because just recently, a firm, Weil, Gotshal [Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, New York, New York], took us all pro bono, and they financed people, go with--took us on pro bono.  And so all of those things are being worked out.  In the meantime, is [HistoryMaker] Walter [J.] Turnbull able to survive this?  Is the big question of the day because it's so labor-intensive at this time and to be, you know, when you don't have enough money to hire the assistance, you know, the kinds of assistance at the level that you need, it is very hard.  And so, the burden just gets right back on Walter Turnbull.  And so, this is a very difficult time for us in our history.  We still have the reputation.  We can still command the fees.  But because we have this relationship with the [New York City] Department of Education, which wants to--it's not the way to not cut back, but to read over to how things should be done and, therefore, they're messing with my process.  And without that process, I cannot produce the world class choir that I've done for thirty-five years.
Story_ID: 297010
Speaker 1: What's the process?
Speaker 2: How a kid starts--
Speaker 1: How does a kid start?
Speaker 2: Fourth grade, train fourth and fifth grade, train for at least a year, and then move into the system of the larger choirs.
Speaker 1: So, you have a school [Choir Academy of Harlem, New York, New York] now?
Speaker 2: A partnership with the New York City Department of Education.  And that's what it's, and where they provide teachers for the academic.  And I provide all of the artistic.  It's supposed to be a partnership.  What they are now trying to do is to put everything under the, the scope of the Board of Education, the way the board of education works, which, obviously, hasn't been successful in training kids.  But for all the years that we had kids without the board of education, our kids were graduating at high numbers, 95 percent, you know, anywhere from 95 to 98 percent graduate every year, having been accepted to colleges and universities all over this country.  Kids who have come in, and it was started with kids who were on what they consider lower level.  But by the time they graduate from Boys Choir of Harlem, they were top levels because of the process of working with them, both academically, socially, and musically.  So, they have this music and this raison d'etre, and then they had counselors to work with them every week.  And that's how we brought kids up.  That's uppermost on my mind.  It's present and it's hard to, to really exist at this point.
Speaker 1: What do you foresee?  What do you, yeah?
Speaker 2: I haven't given up yet.  I still have that thing that really made the Boys Club of Harlem--what really made me.  I don't give up that easily.  And I see us coming out of the woods, in terms of audits, and IRS [Internal Revenue Service], and this and that.  But our relationship, the partnership that we've had, flipped, how many years--twelve years with the Department of Education is running sour because they want to take over the Boys Choir of Harlem.  See, the Boys Choir of Harlem has been successful, with all these kids graduating, and going to college and doing, and all of that.  But they would like to control it.  And we are a legal 501(c)(3), and it's, it's like fighting the big boy, you know what I'm saying?  It's, it's very, very difficult.
Speaker 1: But as I understand it, you founded, and are the director of the choir.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: So that choir is yours?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: With or without the school system.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  But with a board that does not--they want to find the easy, cheap way out.  It's kind of hard.  And so, presently, we're asking, you know, we're asking friends to help us, you know.  And the one person who's really come to our aid is the congressman, [HistoryMaker] Charles [B.] Rangel.  He's always loved the Boys Choir of Harlem, and uses his influence to help us raise money, and to now, to help us to develop a new board that can be complementary and supportive.
Story_ID: 297011
Speaker 1: So if we were to move back in time, how do you feel?  What were some of the steps that were taken, like talk to me about to--the process of--I mean, at one point, you had 3, uh, $3.8 million--
Speaker 2: Budget.
Speaker 1: --budget.  How did that build from the church basement [of Ephesus Seventh-day Adventist Church, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How did you do it?  You say hard work but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I fundraised, fundraised, networked, and worked very hard.  And the most important thing through all of this was the needs of the students that we serve.  When I saw the kids, I needed to count tutors.  I would go out and raise the money for academic tutors.  The Board of Education [New York City Department of Education] didn't do anything with that.  They didn't give us any money for that, never put real resources into our school.  So, we got to that height with our quality of our work, which got you attention, and helped do the fundraiser.  We were knocked down.  There was a scandal at the Boys Choir of Harlem.  A counselor [director of counseling, Frank Jones, Jr.] abused a kid--one, the first and last, in, you know, the thirty-five year history.  But to those people who wanted to knock us down, they used that, and continually to try to discredit.  It's really not going to work though (laughter).  It's really not going to work because people know, you know, what's happening.  Even in the media, they read between the lines, they read between the lines.  Just yesterday, how many--it's been four years since that scandal happened?  A lady stopped me on the street.  She says, "I'm praying for you."  I don't know who this lady is.  I have this happen to me often.  I'm praying for you, and remember, they can't keep a good man down--a little old black lady.  I know who she is, I know who she was, but that has happened to me more in the past year than ever because with the Boys Choir of Harlem, it's great news, you know, 'cause people know the Boys Choir of Harlem.  And so, they try to use that.  And it, oh, and it happened during the time when the Catholic church's big problems with, so there--I mean, I'm the head, so I get the blame because I hired the person.
Speaker 1: Did it cost you financially?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because money, you know, have tried up (unclear) dried up, but that's one of the reasons there are some concerns about money.  If we did not have the ability to command fees at the level that we do, we'd be gone.  But, thank God, we do have that, and that's keeping us even as it begins to get better.  People are beginning to start to, to give again to the Boys Choir.
Story_ID: 297012
Speaker 1: So, moving a little bit to 1995, you wrote your autobiography, 'Lift Every Voice[: Expecting the Most and Getting the Best from All of God's Children,' Dr. Walter Turnbull and Howard Manly], which is also the Negro National Anthem ['Lift Every Voice and Sing'].  Is it called the Black National Anthem?
Speaker 2: Yeah, either (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).  How did the book come about?
Speaker 2: Well, I had a bunch of real snazzy lawyers who wanted to make sure that the Boys Choir of Harlem got what it deserves.  And although I missed Gary Rosenthal, he was a wonderful guy, and that's part of the, the little, the deals that were able to, to get for, for us.  And it was a Hyperion book.  It's now out of print and I, I have the rights of reserve, back to me, so I'm going to get it reprinted, and then write the next one (laughter) because the next one will be more about--not the history of the Boys Choir [of Harlem], but about the technique, that how-to, so I'm looking forward to that.  But, anyway, that book, 'Lift Every Voice: Expecting the Most and Getting the Best out of All God's Children' really kind of summarizes what it is we do.  We take kids, and get them all moving in the same direction.  You know, kids becoming, and being a part of something bigger than themselves, is very important in, you know, a society today, or a city like New York [New York], you know, where you're nobody.  But you're a part, when you're a part of something, like the Boys Choir of Harlem, you really are somebody.  Everybody needs to be somebody, so all of those things are important in the development of people.  And that's what the Boys Choir of Harlem is about--the development of people, not just about singing, not just about education, it's all of that, and makes it happen.
Speaker 1: So, when you, when you look through this book, what are some of the highlights for you in the history of the Boys Choir of Harlem?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Perhaps the main things--I mean, some of the important things are the things that happened in my life, I start with--
Speaker 1: That is, they won the--okay.
Speaker 2: --that influenced, that influenced the development of the Boys Choir.
Speaker 1: And those--I guess it started out would be the three women who raised you?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, absolutely, how important they were, how determined they were.  I mean, if you can think of a Harriet Tubman, that was a Harriet Tubman in my life.  If you can think of a, you know, Sojourner Truth, that was in my life--strong women, strong women.  And I was blessed to have them in my life to guide me, and help me along.
Story_ID: 297013
Speaker 1: So, at one point, you took the choir to the Guggenheim Museum [Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, New York] to perform?
Speaker 2: Yes, we went, went to the--we performed a lot, the Guggenheim, and, and just all over in the major venues in, in this city.  But more importantly, I think, our first big trip to Europe, Haarlem to Haarlem, we went to Haarlem, Holland [Haarlem, the Netherlands], which is the namesake of our Harlem because there, of course, the Dutch owned everything in New York [New York] (laughter).  And it was great.  And to go to Breukelen in Holland and understand, or Bronx, you know, you were going up to the Bronc, B-R-O-N-C [sic. James Bronck], you know, and it became the Bronx.  All Dutch settlers are--it's all very interesting.  And so, we performed in the cathedral, the Grote Kerk, in Haarlem, Holland.  And that was the beginning.  I remember (laughter) a kid who wrote his home to his mother that there were thousands of people in a line around the cathedral to get in to, just to hear us.  There simply wasn't, but when we went to Notre Dame [de Paris, Paris, France] on that same trip, we were singing Notre Dame.  The kid wrote home and told his mom--it was so wonderful, but he didn't see the hunchback (laughter).  Those kinds of experiences for children, and for me, were wonderful.  So, where did I travel that was my favorite place?  It could have been anywhere--Europe, we went to Europe five times.  We've been to Japan three times.
Speaker 1: What was the experience in Japan like?
Speaker 2: Oh, wonderful.  The Jap-, the Japanese really loved the Boys Choir of Harlem.  And the--it--at which brings me to a point that all of our audiences respond exactly the same way, no matter what country, what continent, to the Boys Choir of Harlem, as the people here.  Mothers see children, and they adore them.  Educators see children that are disciplined and purposeful, and they adore them and respect them.  They don't see what makes their face and the color of their skin important is that--oh, wow, this is not what we've heard that they do.  Everywhere, people respond to the Boys Choir of Harlem the same way--with a lot of respect for hard work.
Story_ID: 297014
Speaker 1: When you think about your life, what you've created, even where we are today with the Boys Choir of Harlem, what would you like for your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I've been asked that before, and I don't even know how to answer it.  But I want to, you know, I was thinking in the car just yesterday--if I can help somebody, you know that song?  (Singing) "Then my living will not be in vain."  What else can there be?  There is no money.  It is not a field that commands great fees and money.  Fame perhaps, but fame is fleeting.  I would have been true to everything that was taught to me in terms of values, values, standards, and pass that on because I see so many of my men now--they're not boys--who are in all kinds of fields, from banking to policemen, to, you know, teachers, preachers.  I see so many of them, and they often say to me, "You have been the catalyst in my life that has helped me to be what I am today."  That is a good feeling.  And they come to me and say that to me.  What would I have done?  I would never have gone to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  I would have never gone to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  I would have never gone to Tougaloo [Tougaloo College, Touglaloo, Mississippi].  I never, I would have never gone to Central State [Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio].  I would have never have gone to Juilliard School of Music [The Juilliard School, New York, New York].  I would have never gone to the Manhattan School of Music [New York, New York].  My kids are at all, all of those places, and trained well.  And they realize that their lives would have been different had there not been a Boys Choir of Harlem.
Story_ID: 297015
Speaker 1: Why do you think history is important?
Speaker 2: I think history and an understanding of history is important, so we don't make the same mistakes, so that we improve on all of what it is we can do, and to keep everybody honest (laughter).  People don't want to remember what has happened in this country.  They don't want to remember.  Nowadays, when you begin to talk about it--oh, there, you got to go back there.  I had some of my kids to tell me in college, when they are discussing racism with their fellow students--oh, but we're here now.  Shortsighted, and not an understanding truly of history.  And I, so I think history--it is important to know all of this.  The more they know, the better equipped to deal with what's coming at them.
Story_ID: 297016
Speaker 1: Why did you agree to share your oral history with us here at The HistoryMakers?
Speaker 2: Because I agreed because [HistoryMaker] George [L.] Brown was, at one point, been a chairman of the board for the Boys Choir of Harlem, whom I admire.  And George is--I think seventy-five, a Tuskegee Airman, a man that I admired.  And he was always sensitive to what was happening to me, and he recommended me.  And I think that he's one of the true heroes, and a black man who didn't forget that he was a black man, even though he is, you know, has done wonderful things in his life.  But he didn't forget.  I respect that, I respect that.  So, that's why and, you see, and, also, in the back of my mind, I guess, I think that people only see the performing side of the Boys Choir of Harlem, and they don't realize how lives are being changed.  They don't realize, you know, most people don't know that we have a school.  And they don't realize how people are different, you know, because they have experienced the Boys Choir of Harlem.  The parents are different because they've experienced the Boys Choir of Harlem.  They've learned, too, and they are appreciative because they see the difference in their children from having gone to the Boys Choir of Harlem.
Speaker 1: Is there anything else that we didn't cover that you feel is--should be covered and that is (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I'll think of it when I go home.  That's the way it's always is, you know, I'll think of it and, but I know that--I don't know how, historically, we can deal with.  See, it's a lot of stuff at a lot of places.  It's time for [HistoryMaker] Walter [J.] Turnbull to try to get it out there.  I never promoted it and marketed it--what has, what I accomplished before--reserved southern boy who don't make no big waves.  That gets in the way when we're talking about sharing something that could help us all in the long run.  So, people need to know my struggles.  People to know, need to know my fears.  People need to know my dreams, and how one person can make a difference with a lot of sacrifice.  But I don't want--my fear is that the sacrifice will pull me under if, you know, I'm not, not having a pension, for example.  We had one at the Boys Choir of Harlem, but they didn't raise no money, so that we could keep our thing, you know, going.  Surely, there's a lesson for Walter Turnbull and all of this that has happened.  And I look for the lesson--I keep going.

He was a first board member, but this is him when he was a little boy, and he was truly bad.  Since I had to take care of all of the kids, he was the worst.  But he became a really close friend and colleague, as we started the Boys Choir of Harlem for the first fifteen or twenty years.
