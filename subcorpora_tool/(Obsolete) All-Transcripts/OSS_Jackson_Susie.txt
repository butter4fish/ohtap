 Larson  Today is April 8, 2010. My name is Mary Larson, and I   m here with  Mrs. Susie Jackson in her home in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. Mrs.  Jackson, thank you so much for agreeing to be part of this project.  Yes, you   re very welcome.  I   d like to start by getting a little bit of general biographical information  from you. Could you tell me a little bit about where you were born and  where you grew up?  I was born in Tulia, Texas. Then, I must have been at a very young age,  my parents moved to Oklahoma, around the Southwestern part, around  Mountain View, and I grew up mostly around Mountain View,  Oklahoma. I went to high school there in Mountain View. I met my  husband. He was still in the army when I met him. I believe my cousin  introduced me to him, and it   s been too long to remember definite  details, but we got married in 1946. I finished my college, and so did he.  We first went to Cameron College, and then after we graduated from  there we went to Oklahoma State. That was  Oklahoma  A M at that  time. I was a home economics student.  What do you remember the campus being like? What were your first  impressions of the campus? Had you been there before?  I had not been there before. It was pretty large. We lived in a hut that  was there. We had a very small place to live, but we did very well there.  Was it an old Quonset hut?  Yes. It was an old Quonset hut.  And was that there from some of the leftover from the military?  5  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  I think it was. I never thought about where it came from, but that   s  where we resided.  Do you remember where that was around the campus?  It was north and west of the campus.  And you would have been married while there. Did you marry while you  were in college?  Yes.  And what did you do for your social life when you were in college, or  were you so busy that you     We were so busy, I mean to tell you. Our social life was very little, very  little, really. But we went home for Christmas and Thanksgiving and that  sort of thing, but we didn   t really have a quote    social life.     So when you were working on your home economics degree, do you  have any particular professors that made an impression on you, or were  there any classes that made an impression?  I remember some classes, but I don   t remember the teacher   s names. I   m  sorry, I don   t remember.  That   s alright. What areas were you particularly interested in home  economics?  I was interested in home life, in helping people to live their life  successfully, and I liked home economics. I felt like it could give me  information and skills that I wouldn   t have otherwise that would help me  in my own family life.  Did you say you got married after two years of college? Was that     Yes. I think I graduated from high school in    44. I got married in    46. So  I probably  graduated in     48, something like that.  Right after you left Oklahoma A M, when you both had graduated,  what did you do at that point?  I went to work at a little town, Ripley, and I taught school there   home  economics. And reading and writing for the eighth grade.  What was your husband doing at that point?  6  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  He was going to school, working on his master   s degree.  So how exactly did you end up as part of the Ethiopia adventure?  I   m trying to remember. We had moved back to Stillwater, and Ben   Jackson  was working at OSU, and he had that call to see if he would  be interested, and I thought it would be a good thing.  Now, you mentioned you came back to Stillwater. Where had you been  in the interim? I guess I should   ve gotten you wherever you were first.  We were at Ripley, and we moved back from Ripley to Stillwater. It was  easier for Ben to go to school, and then go to work when we lived in  Stillwater.  Before you went off to Ethiopia, had either of you lived somewhere else?  No, I don   t think so. Well, we went to Minnesota after we had come  back from Ethiopia.  We   ll go on to Ethiopia first then. And we can cover the rest of that, but  your husband got the call to see if he was interested in going to  Ethiopia?  Yes.  And you thought it would be exciting.  I thought it would be. I was ready for a change.  How big was the town that you grew up in?  Mountain View was a small town.  So you were ready for some travel, it sounds like.  I was ready for some travel and some new experiences.  Now, what was your husband   s position at A M at that point? Do you  remember?  I don   t remember at all what he did.  And he would   ve been with Agronomy.  He would   ve been in Agronomy, yes.  7  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  What year was it when you first went over to Ethiopia?  In 1955.  And who made the arrangements for you to go? What was that process  like?  I think Bill Abbott took care of all of that, so that we didn   t have to  make contact with the airport or any of that, tickets. He did that, his  office did.  Were there any sort of preparations you had to make, like getting  particular supplies or shots or anything like that?  Oh, yes. We had to have some shots. I don   t remember what we had to  have. I know that I bought shoes for Sherrie  daughter , four different  sizes, and clothing in different sizes, to figure out what she would be  wearing.  Because she was probably about three, I think you said, at the time?  Yes.  Now, she was your only child at that point?  At that point, she was. And Ben and I took extra clothes, too.  What did you expect when you went to Ethiopia? Did you know much  about it? Or was it what you anticipated?  I had a first cousin whose husband was over there. He was a  veterinarian, working with the same group, and she was there. Actually I  don   t recall much about correspondence, and really I wasn   t concerned  or worried about it.  Did you all travel together on the way over?  Yes, we did.  So your husband didn   t go over first and then     No, we traveled together.  Where were you first assigned to live and work when you got there?  We were in Addis Ababa. And lived in the house, and had two servants,  8  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  I believe, we had two people working for us.  At the time, your husband was attached to the college, but my  understanding is that the college buildings weren   t ready yet?  That   s right.  So the classes were going on in Addis.  I don   t know if the classes were going on, exactly at that time. I really  don   t know the dates of that.  But you got there in 1955.  Yes.  And you were in Addis, now were you in a neighborhood with other folks  from Oklahoma A M?  No, there happened to be a family across the street that was in this  group, but we were scattered around. We were not in a compound all  just with that group.  So you would   ve had neighbors from all over?  We did have neighbors from all over, yes.  Who were some of the folks that you remember living around you?  There was one lady, her husband was in the part where they worked with  water wells. Another lady, the administrator of the business manager,  Vivian   s husband, let   s see, I   m trying to think what his name was, was  there. And, of course, my cousin was there.  And what was your cousin   s name?  Her name is Charlene, Charlene Murphy. And the family, he worked  with the architecture part of the college. It   s very hard for me to  remember their names.  When you first got there, you said you had a house. Was it in the middle  of the city, or was it more on the outskirts?  It was in the city, I guess you would say.  And do you remember anything about the size of Addis Ababa? Was it  9  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  very large?  It was a pretty large place. It was the capital. They had a movie house,  and they had a real good hospital    the  Seventh Day Adventist  hospital, my second daughter was born in that hospital.  What kind of stores and facilities did you have there? Was there a  market nearby?  We could buy food. I   m just trying to remember, what did we not buy?  We were able to order food from Europe. I bought canned hot dogs  (laughter) and canned bacon, and then I had bought flour, and some  seasonings, but the fresh vegetables, and a lot of the meat, we just ate off  of the market.  Was that fairly close by to your house?  I think it must   ve been, because I don   t remember having to drive very  much.  Could you describe the house that you lived in? Give us a sense of the  layout.  In my kitchen, I had a propane stove, and then I had an outside kitchen,  also. It was a wood stove. That   s where we baked the bread.  Oh, I bet that was wonderful.  Oh, it was. I had a real good girl that helped me cook and watch my  daughter Sherrie. I had a man that worked outside in the yard, and in our  yard we had beautiful sweat pea flowers. Every morning we went out  and picked these fresh sweat peas, because they needed to be picked  every day so the new flowers would come on. In my house I had a large  area, kind of a hallway that was where I kept the canned goods and  supplies. Then to the left was the dining room. It was nice and large, had  windows, and then opening into the living room. We had a fireplace in  the living room, and the furniture was furnished. Then, we had three  bedrooms. We kept one bedroom as a storeroom.  All of the extra things that you   d brought with you, all of Sherrie   s  clothes     Everything.  And for the few years and the extra clothes that you brought and some  of the supplies.  10  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  They would all go in there and we would lock it up. That   s the way it  had to be.  Were the houses open for the most part?  The houses were in a compound, and we had a compound wall that I  believe it was cement, and of course a gate for the car. We had a night  guard. It was not a large area, but it was adequate. I think we may have  had a small garden.  When you mention the compound, were there a number of houses in the  compound?  Oh no, no. Just for my house. Each house had their own wall.  So each house basically had their own night guard. So there were  issues     Whatever they wanted. Yes. So we always closed our windows and we  had wooden shutters that we brought and shut up so that we felt  perfectly safe.  But I guess there had been problems.  We just had to be cautious.  What were the grounds around the house like? You mentioned that there  was room for a small garden, and you mentioned you had sweet peas  and some flowers.  Yes. Well, there was some lawn, and I just don   t remember details. We  didn   t have a garage, but we had a place to park our car beside our  house.  And speaking of cars, did you do a lot of traveling in the area while you  were there?  No, we did not do a lot of traveling.  Probably not much cause to.  No, and I think Ben was gone so much that we just didn   t go.  So was he gone a lot at the campus, or going back and forth?  Well, he could   ve gone to the campus, but I don   t recall. He may have  11  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  gone once or twice, but I think when we moved down here is when the  classes started. I may be wrong about that. I   m not for sure when the  classes started.  How long were you in Addis Ababa? Do you remember offhand? I mean,  was it just a few months or were you there for a long while?  We were there probably a year.  Could you walk me through an average day when you were in Addis, or  was there an average day? What would you do during the course of the  day once you got up?  Well, of course, when you think of having servants, you just think,     Ohhh   .    But they   re kind of like a child in a way. You tell them what  to do, and then you, it   s according to how much maturity they have and  who trained them, that we made bread, and made sure that there were  always things to be prepared for food. I think I spent a lot of time with  Sherrie, and I may have visited with my neighbor across the street.  And who was that again?  I don   t remember her name. (Laughs)  But she was from the Oklahoma area?  Well, her husband worked in the water. They were digging wells.  Okay, they were with the well project. I was just trying to get a sense of  if it was someone from the US, because other people we   ve talked to  have mentioned,    Oh, there was this Swedish couple across the street,     or the Moravians down the road, or, you know.  There was a Canadian lady there, and she was very nice. Very  hospitable. And Sherrie called her    the lady with the blue hair    because  her hair was white, but she really had put blue coloring on there.  One of those blue rinses. Speaking of Sherrie, she spent time with you.  Did she have playmates in the neighborhood?  I don   t remember if she did or not. I   ve just forgotten.  Well, it   s been a long time, too.  I haven   t thought about this.  12  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Now, why don   t you tell me about when you moved to Dire Dawa?  We moved to Dire Dawa. That was really something. We moved and  Charlynn had been born, so we must   ve been in Addis Ababa over two  years.  Before we get to Dire Dawa, we should talk about the addition to the  family. (Laughs)  Okay, yes. When I got pregnant I went to the doctor, Dr. Stein, and he  was a missionary doctor at the Seventh Day Adventist   s hospital, and  my cousin Charlene had her baby there, also. So I had Charlynn at the  hospital, and a few months after that we moved to Dire Dawa.  What was that hospital like?  It was very clean, very orderly, but because we were Americans,  different, they didn   t act like nurses that,    You   re going to do what I  say,    that authority. So, my cousin, she just got up out of her bed and  went to the bathroom when she was in labor and the nurses didn   t stop  her. They just couldn   t stop her. But we had a very good hospital care.  So that wasn   t a worry for you while you were there?  No, it wasn   t.  Did you go there when you were in Dire Dawa and Alemaya, too? Or  was that a little further?  No, they were so far away. The only time we would go to Addis Ababa,  I don   t think I ever went to Addis Ababa after I got into Alemaya. At  Alemaya, we had a nurse, Gwen, and her husband worked in Animal  Science. Her responsibility was the staff. I believe she also looked at  students, but like Charlynn had a lot of allergy and ear trouble, she  would take care of that. She was as good as a doctor, very good. So, if  we went back to Addis Ababa, we   d have to take a plane, and I   m sure  there were good doctors in Dire Dawa, but I don   t think we ever went to  them.  A few months  after Charlynn was born  you moved to Dire Dawa. Now  that was probably about when the college opened?  Yes, I think that   s when it started, about that time.  Were you in Dire Dawa because there wasn   t housing available yet?  13  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  That   s right.  So why don   t you tell me about the move there?  Of course, we moved all of our furniture and everything we had there.  Again, we had three bedrooms, and one of them was kind of a storage  room, and Sherrie had her own room, and Charlynn had a room.  To  daughter  I believe you were together. I am just remembering. I think  that we, maybe Sherrie and Charlynn were in the same room. But we  had a fireplace, and a nice kitchen. The one thing that we didn   t have  was electricity all the time.  That was one of the things I was going to ask about, both water and  electricity.  With electricity, each man on the staff took their turn turning the  electricity on and off. And if it was one person   s time, one man, I can   t  think of his name now, you knew you   d better have everything done at  9:00, because he was going to turn the electricity off, and our  refrigerators stayed cold all night long.  As long as you didn   t open them, right?  As long as you didn   t open them. The interesting thing was I had to heat  my baby   s bottle at night, and take a candle and go in the kitchen and  that was my light. It was warm enough there that we didn   t lock our  house, and our kitchen door was open. I looked out through my kitchen  door one day and there was an owl, a white owl, and he was looking at  me, and our eyes met, and just a passing thing. Oh, we had animals  come to try to get our garbage.  Did they try to get your garden, too?  Fortunately, I don   t think we had a lot of trouble with our garden. But  we had a beautiful garden, and we had beautiful plants there. Oh, they  were gorgeous.  What kinds of things did you     We had geraniums, just as big as a washtub, and you could stick  something in the ground and it would grow. It was really nice. And  people who had a green thumb really enjoyed it. I think I was so busy  with the children that I didn   t really do justice to my yard, but we did  have a garden.  What kinds of things did you have in the garden?  14  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  We had onions, green beans, and sweet peppers. I   m trying to think what  else we had.  I was just wondering what grew well there, but it sounds like anything  probably would.  Everything grew well. It was wonderful. And we could buy vegetables at  the market. Beautiful big heads of cauliflower.  Do you have a sense of how big Dire Dawa was?  It wasn   t a big town.  So you could leave your doors open. It wasn   t like Addis, where you had  to have things locked up?  Yes. We felt pretty safe there.  Were a lot of your neighbors there from A M?  Yes. Let   s see, who were my neighbors     I was just trying to get a sense if you tended to be in one area or it was  more like Addis where you were spread out.  Now, I   m getting Dire Dawa and Alemaya mixed up. In Dire Dawa we  lived upstairs, we lived over something. I don   t know what we lived  over, but we had a nice large place.  Were you there long?  Not long.  Just until something opened up in Alemaya?  I just don   t remember how long. But we got together, the group, we saw  each other often enough that we kept in contact. There was a friendship  and a feeling of that we were close, that we could depend on each other,  we could visit. In fact, we were our own entertainment. That was the  thing about it. We didn   t have TV or anything. We had to do our own  entertainment, which was good.  What did you tend to do when you got together?  I think we usually had a party. We ate and talked, and we would have,  like, Halloween. We danced. We did dancing. Oh we would just   I  15  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  don   t know what the music was, who provided it. I just remember that  we did a lot of dancing.  I was just going to ask if there were any musicians in the group, or     No, I don   t think so.  Speaking of not having television, how did you get your news  from the  US  when you were in Dire Dawa or Alemaya, for that matter?  Well, it didn   t bother me, I didn   t have any news. I didn   t care. (Laughs)  Did you get letters, as far as family and so on?  Yes, we got letters, yes. We got letters and I was not a good  correspondent.  Well, it sounds like you would   ve been busy.  Yes, I was. I was busy, and then I started working half days, well, I  worked I think it was about four days, maybe. I worked at the library,  probably part time.  At the college, then?  At the college, and when I was going to Cameron College, I worked in  the library. So I had some experience that I could fall back on. That   s the  reason that I helped in the library.  And what were you doing there? I mean, just general, a little bit of  everything?  I was responsible for the library. I did checking in the books, and  checking to see if they returned them. The students had books that they,  I guess the college furnished books, I   m not really sure, but we had a lot  of books for classes. And a lot of research books for them. It wasn   t a  big library, but it was adequate I guess.  But they had set it up with the research materials the students would  need.  Set it up for their class work.  Do you remember if you got any money to buy new books, or if those  were just things that were ordered as part of the process?  16  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  You know, I don   t remember what we did.  I was just trying to get a sense of, you think about building a new  college, there are so many things with the physical plant     Oh my, yes.     and with having students and dorms and places to live and places to  eat, and the library, and how does all that get set up, get started.  The library was set up by someone else. I can   t think of her name, but  she probably ordered quite a few things. But I don   t remember much  about ordering. It   s been too long ago.  Speaking of schools and libraries, at least Sherrie probably would   ve  been in school for a little bit while you were over there?  For the children, there was one lady who taught all the children that  were school age. I think Sherrie was in the kindergarten and first grade.  But their school was completely separate from the college.  Was it essentially run by Oklahoma A M at the time?  Oh no, no. I don   t think so. It was run by just the group there.  So the families that would   ve been there, or     Yes, the families would have organized it and set it up. I don   t think that  OSU had anything to do with that. To my knowledge.  I was just wondering because one place we were talking to someone,  they said,    Well, there was a mission school nearby, and some of the  kids went there.     Yes.  So that was on one of the other farms.  Yes. That could   ve been down in another place. But we were way out in  the boondocks. We were an independent family type thing. There wasn   t  much. But we had church. One of the men was a very dedicated person,  and he would give sermons, so we had church on Sunday.  Do you remember who that was?  No. And they would be a good person to interview.  17  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Now, do you remember if the changes in the seasons meant a change in  what you were able to do, as far as being outside a lot or traveling? Like  during the rainy season, were there things that were problematic that  you remember?  I don   t remember. It was always sunshiny, it was kind of cool in the  mornings, and by 1:00, you were ready to take off any jacket you had  had on, and it was summer. And the sun was shining.  Was that at a high altitude? Do you remember?  Yes.  About the same as Alemaya? Or     Alemaya was. Dire Dawa was way low. It was hot there, but Alemaya  was up a little higher. But I don   t think it was as high as Addis Ababa.  So Dire Dawa was lower and a little more desert climate?  Yes, that   s right. Very desert. We had, oh, we had beautiful poinsettias.  How far was Dire Dawa from Alemaya?  All I remember was a huge, dangerous road that wound around  mountains and was gravel. There was nothing to keep you     No guard rails?  No guard rails. It was really a thrill every time you went to Dire Dawa  and came back.  Did you do that a lot?  No.  Was your husband having to go from, when you were living in Dire  Dawa did he have to go to     When he did go to college. He did.  He had to do that every day?  I think so. I think he did.  That would   ve been an adventure.  18  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Boy, oh boy, yes. Those big old trucks coming by. Those roads were  dangerous. But the roads that the Italians built when they were in  Ethiopia, oh, they were so good. Oh boy, I sure admire the expertise that  they have.  Some real engineers?  Yes. But this     But that wasn   t the road between Dire Dawa and Alemaya     No, it wasn   t.  Do you remember about how long you were in Dire Dawa before you  went to Alemaya? Was it maybe a few months?  Let   s see, Charlynn was born in August, and we had Christmas there.  We probably were there a few months before we went, moved, were  able to move.  And Alemaya was where you said you saw the owl and had the beautiful  garden?  Yes.  Was there still staff at the house in Alemaya, or was that just in Addis?  You   d mentioned having someone to help with the cooking     Oh, yes, we had servants. And we couldn   t do without servants. We  couldn   t begin to work, to do housework because we had to boil our  water. We had to prepare everything from scratch. And, my goodness,  you have to wash clothes. It would just be too much for one person to  do, especially with a family.  What were the washing facilities like?  We brought a washing machine with us, and it was outside on cement,  maybe we had a cement porch, but it was out there. We just left the  washing machine out there and had tubs.  Oh, I   ll tell you something interesting. (Laughs) After I had my baby, of  course, we moved to Alemaya. Well see, Alemaya is not a town. We  lived near Alemaya. We were out, boy I mean to tell you, we were out  there. And our dear friends, Lucille and Hugh Hedger, Sherrie played  with their two daughters and went to school with them. Very dear  friends. I don   t know why, but they had a goat. They acquired a goat,  19  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  and that goat had the whole campus that he could, was free to roam in,  and he was a nuisance.  As goats are wont to be. (Laughs)  As goats are. Yes. And he, I looked out the window one day and here  was this goat on his hind legs eating my panties off of the clothes line. I  only had three pair of panties that would fit because I just had Charlynn.  And, oh, I was so mad at that goat, but because I valued the Hedger   s  friendship, I held my peace, and I knew that that goat wouldn   t live  forever. (Laughs) One day, that goat disappeared. No one asked  anything about him. So he probably ended up in a stew pot somewhere.  (Laughs)  His name was Stew. (Laughter)  But we had a lot of friendships, a lot of comrade things. My husband  was more or less a workaholic. He spent a lot of time just working. But  there were free times when people would get together and visit, and we  had a good time.  Did you mainly socialize with the folks from Oklahoma, or did you get to  know some of the students, or some of the locals?  I didn   t socialize with any of the students, and the local people, they  were way off, I mean, the town.  Oh, that   s right, because there wasn   t a village at Alemaya. Just the  college.  There was no town near.  So there weren   t really any local people locally.  No, there were no local people. Now, Hugh and Lucille knew people  more than we did, and there was a missionary group that they knew. So  there were some people that probably did more than what we did in  socializing with others, but we stayed mostly with the group. It was  easier that way.  Now, what parts of the assignment over in Ethiopia would you say were  the most difficult for you? Was it just the logistics, or was it being away  from home, or     Well, of course I missed my mother and my family back in the States.  But there was a lot, I just can   t, I don   t remember that I felt a need    It   s  20  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  just hard to say what I wanted. I know that I kept busy, and I was  occupied most of the time, so I don   t   the ones that did not work, a lot  of the women worked as secretaries, but those of us who stayed at home,  like, I had a part time job, but lots of times I would go and visit with  someone in their home that was not working. Most of us had small  children, so we kind of were kept busy at home.  Plenty busy. What did you enjoy the most about your time there?  I enjoyed the weather. It was just wonderful. I enjoyed the fresh flowers  and the fresh fruit. I enjoyed that. It   s funny, I didn   t miss the radio, I  didn   t miss that much. I think just the way that we lived. I enjoyed  having servants to wash my dishes. I really enjoyed that. (Laughs)  I can see that.  I liked to have entertainment, I liked to entertain, and so I enjoyed  having people over.  Now, while you were over in Ethiopia, were there particular American  customs that you tried to keep up, like Thanksgiving?  Yes. We kept up Thanksgiving, we had Easter hunts for the children,  and we had Christmas dinners and the children gave programs at  Christmas and at Thanksgiving. And the summer time, I guess it   s  according to when we   sometimes when it was vacation time, people  would take a chance and go to another country and see another country,  something like that. But going fishing was one, going camping was  another, and that was fun.  Did you do that right around     In that area. Yes. And we enjoyed that a lot   the fresh fish. The men did  a lot of hunting, and they would bring back wild boars. That meat was so  sweet and tender, oh it was good.  That sounds wonderful. If you were keeping up some of these US  traditions, were there things that you had to do differently? I mean, were  there differences in some of the celebrations? Were you able to get a  turkey, for example, did you have to substitute something else for a  turkey?  I think that we probably had turkey. We had an animal science man  there. I think he raised turkeys. I don   t believe that we had to substitute.  We may have had ham and turkey. There was a good market down in  Dire Dawa that was by  an  Italian man  that  had it, and we would get  21  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  things from him.  So you didn   t have trouble getting anything that you   d normally have for  some of these....  No, no we didn   t. No, I don   t remember being troubled with that.  Now, did you learn any Ethiopian traditions?  Any Ethiopian traditions? I don   t remember that I did a one. I just don   t  remember.  So it wasn   t something that, well, especially if you were at the college  and there wasn   t a village there.  It was hard to get, you really had to have a point in doing that.  Was there anything you remember in Addis or Dire Dawa, as far as  annual celebrations or festivals? Anything you remember seeing?  Let   s see. I think they had, see, we lived in Thailand for eighteen years. I  get Ethiopia and Thailand mixed up. I don   t remember that they had  something that I would remember. I don   t remember things in Ethiopia.  Birthday parties and Easter egg hunts. We took every opportunity to  have fun.  Some sort of a party.  Yes.  We were talking about the turkeys, that there might have been turkeys  around. As far as the local animal population, what do you remember  there? You mentioned the owl. What other wildlife did you see?  Well, an interesting thing was the hyenas. They would come to try and  get in our garbage and eat. They ate everything. There was a man there  called the hyena man, and somehow, I never did go, but he would get  hyenas to come and you could go and watch the hyenas with safety. It  was interesting. They did it at night.  He was a local?  He was a local man   local native. Then, let   s see, I   m trying to  remember if we had any pets. I don   t think we had any pets. I don   t think  we had any.  22  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  One time Ben brought home a monkey. That was when we were living  in Addis Ababa. And this monkey was so cute. I   m trying to remember  if I gave   I think it seemed like I, it was before Charlynn was born. And  he was jealous of Sherrie. Oh yes. One time he jumped on Sherrie, and  he was going to bite her, and he moved his head back and forth after he  had latched onto that sweater, and her poor little arm would   ve been  mincemeat, but he wasn   t able to get down to her skin. And then there  was a little deer that we got. But for most of the time, we didn   t have  any pets or animals, just that monkey and that little deer. And he didn   t  last long.  The deer or the monkey?  Both of them. (Laughter) No, when I saw how dangerous that monkey  was, oh boy, I didn   t want anything to happen to Sherrie.  Did the children take the whole Ethiopian experience in stride?  Charlynn would   ve because she was born there, but did Sherrie adapt  well when you first went over?  I think she was small enough that she did. She had playmates there when  we moved to Alemaya, so I think her little social life was adequate.  Did you or your husband or either of the children learn Amharic there?  No.  It wasn   t something that     We may have learned some, like bukafinish, we knew that. Bukafinish is     that   s enough, I don   t want anymore.    (Laughs)  Did you learn any Ethiopian dishes while you were there? Did you have  any Ethiopian food at all?  We had injera and wat, that   s kind of like  their  hamburgers and French  fries. It was good. We also had our first pizza there. It was baked from  Dire Dawa, and it was thick bread with the dressing on top.  Do you think it   s because there   d been such an Italian presence in  Ethiopia?  I think so, yes. I think very definitely so.  But there was a pizza parlor in Dire Dawa?  23  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Yes.  Too bad they didn   t deliver. (Laughter)  Yes.  Did you learn to make any Ethiopian dishes?  I didn   t learn over there. I brought recipes back, but I just didn   t learn.  Did you  or  the family have a favorite dish that you made when you got  back?  No. Not necessarily, not really.  Were there any political problems or political tensions while you were  over in Ethiopia that you were aware of? That affected what you were  doing?  I don   t think there was. I know that we really respected their king, and  he was a good man. The thing is that he didn   t move fast enough to  please the people. He wanted to go slowly and do things and there was a  group that wanted everything done immediately. They didn   t understand  how a nation cannot progress real fast, and especially when you have  different tribes and different languages. My goodness. It   s a hard thing  to be ruler over something like that.  And you   re talking about Haile Selassie?  I   m talking about Haile Selassie. His sons were not as helpful as they  could   ve been, at least in my opinion. But that problem did not come  until after we left.  You mentioned when we were talking during the break that Haile  Selassie had actually come to Alemaya while you were there. Can you  tell me a little bit about that?  I think he came when we had a grand opening or a grand celebration of  the college, and we were very busy. My friend Lucille was in the  cafeteria, and she was in charge of the food. All of us shared what we  had. I had my tea set. I had a silver tea set, and we were all thrilled for  him to use something that was ours.  Do you still have that tea set?  I still have that set.  24  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  We should take a picture of that, if that   s around.  Oh, yes, I would. Yes. It   s upstairs, Sherrie.  So was he there for a few days?  He must   ve been there for more than one day. But I don   t know where  he stayed or anything like that.  And did you all get to meet him?  Yes, I have a picture of Sherrie shaking hands with him. See, our  impression of the king is very positive, a very admirable man. He loved  his country, I know that. He loved his people. When we heard what had  happened to him, it just was devastating, because we knew he was not  acting superior or almighty. When he gave the money to the children  that, two or three little boys came and he talked to them, and he went  down into his pocket and got some money and gave it to them, like a  great uncle would do or something. Oh, they were just really thrilled.  This was on the campus?  On the campus. So our experience, I would say, in Ethiopia was very  positive. And yes, when he was there, all of the staff was presented to  him. I couldn   t decide whether to have my gloves on or off to shake his  hand, so many formal things to do.  With royalty there   s always different rules.  Yes.  That sounds like it would   ve been quite an experience.  It was. It really was.  What in your opinion, after knowing some of these other families from  Oklahoma were over in Ethiopia, what do you think was the one thing  that caused the most culture shock?  Coming back to the States. That was a culture shock.  So it wasn   t going to Ethiopia that was the problem     It was coming back. And how ungrateful Americans are for what they  have. They just don   t appreciate what we have. It   s very sad.  25  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Had you had a chance to come back to the US during your time there at  all?  We were there four and a half years, and we came back twice.  Okay, so you   d had a chance to see family.  Yes. In two years    time we came back.  Were you back for a couple of weeks when you came back?  I think we were back for quite awhile, probably a month or so.  And how did you do that? Where did you fly out of to come back?  Well, we left Addis Ababa and on one of our trips we took some time  and toured Europe, and Sherrie went swimming in the Zider Sea. On our  way back from Ethiopia we went on a big ship, and that was quite an  experience. All they wanted was cottage cheese and hot dogs, and here  we had all this lovely food to eat.  (Laughs) So you took a ship back to the US?  To the US     But you   d flown out the first time.  But we flew the first time.  But you took the scenic route on the way back.  That   s right. Yes.  So all the kids wanted was cottage cheese and hot dogs.  Yes. (Laughs)  So you did travel a little bit overseas while you were     Yes, when we came back, on our way back we traveled. Ben got to see  some of Germany, where he was in the war, and let   s see, the  Netherlands, France, and that area. We got a pretty good education on  different countries and more appreciation for the United States.  When you returned, you said it was a tough adjustment. That there was  more of a culture shock coming back.  26  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Yes.  What did you do when you returned to the US, and what did your  husband do?  He had been offered a scholarship to work on his doctorate degree in  Minnesota. So that was where we went. Of course , we went home, went  back to Oklahoma, and then we came to Minnesota for him to start to  school. That was different. It was very different, because in Ethiopia, the  sun is shining every day, lovely breezy weather, just was really nice in  Alemaya on the campus. And then when we got to Minnesota, wow.  Talk about a shock.  Yes. It was a great shock.  So, your husband did his doctoral work there. Over the years, did your  family travel to other locations outside of the US because of his work?  After he got his doctorate degree, we went back to Oklahoma to  Stillwater and stayed a year or two. Then, the Rockefeller Foundation  offered him a job to go to Thailand. His degree was in genetics, plant  genetics, so he knew a lot about rice, but he didn   t know the details of  growing it, so we went to Thailand. We went to the Philippines for about  six months, and he learned how rice was grown, the insects, the  fertilizer, and all the details of that. And then we moved from the  Philippines to Thailand.  This was all on the Rockefeller Foundation?  That   s right. Charlynn and Sherrie went to a school in the Philippines  that taught in English, but it was kind of hard, because teaching in a  second language, it was just hard for them to understand them.  And how old would they have been?  Sherrie was in the ninth grade, and Charlynn was probably in the sixth  or something like that.  How long were you in Thailand after the Philippines?  In Thailand, we were there about seventeen and a half years. Sherrie and  Charlynn finished high school there at an American sponsored school. It  was a very good school, qualified them to enter college, if that   s what  they wanted to do, so that their education was pretty well taken care of.  27  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  So you had quite a stretch in Thailand, then.  Yes, we did.  What was that like?  We came home every year for about three months. We had a nice home,  we lived in a home and then we lived in an apartment house. It felt a  little bit more secure in a large apartment. The apartments were big  compared to what you think about apartments here. We had a swimming  pool. In Thailand, the traffic is heavy, so I did have a driver and a cook.  When we were in a house, we had a man who worked in the yard during  the day, and then we had another man for a night guard at night.  Where were you in Thailand?  We were in Bangkok.  Which is a very busy city.  Yes, it is. It   s a big, busy city. We had a driver for quite awhile, and then  I decided I could drive. (Laughs) Especially after we caught our driver  siphoning gas out of our car and putting it in another car.  Now, at this point was your husband still with the Rockefeller  Foundation?  He was with the Rockefeller Foundation. All in Thailand was with  Rockefeller Foundation.  Was there a particular institute with the foundation?  No, the Rockefeller Foundation was involved in a medical school there  in Thailand. I don   t know what all they supported. I   m just not sure what  all Rockefeller supported, but I know that they supported a school for  doctors, and probably nurses. They, and Ben did too, sent people back to  the States to get more education.  And all of this was based on his agronomy work, his genetic work.  Yes, yes. All rice.  You mentioned that your daughters, when they graduated from high  school there, were set for college. Where did they go to school?  They went back to Stillwater. Sherrie went back to Stillwater and  28  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  finished there with microbiology, and then she became a laboratory  technician. Every year, Charlynn and Sherrie were able to come back for  the summer, which was really nice. Kasetsart is the name of the school  or university that Ben worked with. They were associated with rice  development. The people that Ben worked with were very, very  intelligent, very polite. They were just great people. But they needed  someone with knowledge of improving rice, and they just needed the  expertise that Ben could offer. He felt very humble that they wanted him  to come, because they had so much on their own already going. But he  added a lot to their rice development. Through that research work they  were able to cause the farmer to raise rice that needed hardly any  fertilizer. They grew rice without fertilizer, but their enemy was the  bugs, fungus, and things like that. And so they did plant breeding, they  just bred the rice to overcome some of these problems.  Now, since you had two overseas experiences like that, how did your  time in Ethiopia compare to your time in Thailand, would you say? I  mean, I know you were in Thailand for longer, but just overall, how  would those two experiences compare?  I think I was much more active in Thailand than I was  in Ethiopia ,  because my children were so small. Because I helped get an orphanage  started in Thailand, I worked with the church a lot. I   ll just put a good  word in for the Presbyterian Church. I   m not a Presbyterian, but they  were the first ones to bring printing into Thailand. Christians have  blessed many nations with their knowledge with expertise like that. That  you can be knowledgeable about Christians, when they go out  somewhere, they can really make a difference. If they are truly sincere  and have a goal in mind of what they want. The Thais respect diligence,  they admired the way the missionaries lived, because they were good  people, they didn   t get into trouble, they were honest. There was a  school that was started by the Presbyterians. The church they had on the  campus is where we went to church. We went to a church where there  were about twenty five nationalities. Most of the times our preachers  were retired ministers and they would come and stay two years. There  was an organization that we contacted to bring a pastor over. I learned  to be a secretary of  the  church. I learned to use their printing, taught  Sunday school.  And these were things you could be involved in because your children  weren   t as small as they had been when you were in Ethiopia.  That   s right. There were just facilities available.  Wonderful. Well, getting back to Ethiopia, just a few questions to wrap  up. As you think back on that, how do you feel now about your  29  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  experience over there and about the project?  I tell you, when we see, like this man who received a recognition for the  work he had done, the Ethiopian man  Gebisa Ejeta , I   m sure all of the  men who taught that young man, of course he   s not a real young man  now, but anyway, it   s kind of like a father, so proud of his child. We   re  proud of what they have done, sowing four and a half years, some sowed  more than what we did in that project, in those boys. To see some results  is rewarding, and I think that   s the main thing is that what they gave they  have seen that it paid off and it   s still going on. That   s the thing about it.  The award that you mentioned, that was from the World Health  Organization?  Oh, maybe it was. The  World Food Prize , it is something like a Peace  prize.  Have you kept up friendships with some of the people that you met that  you worked with when you were over in Ethiopia?  Oh yes, yes.  It sounds like, from some of the things you   ve mentioned     Yes, we have. We have. After we came back from Thailand, every two  years they have a banquet, a day, where you go and you see what people  brought from  Ethiopia , see pictures, and see old friends, and see the  children, how they   ve grown, and just renew friendships. Then we had  two or three that we specially kept up with, we kept up with the nurse,  Gwen, and then the Hedgers, yes, they were the other friends.  And those were folks from Ethiopia?  From Ethiopia. And living in Oklahoma City and Stillwater.  Are there things that we haven   t talked about from your experiences in  Ethiopia that you   d like to touch on, or anything about the legacy of that  project that you   d like to discuss?  No, the only thing I can think of is that it was a rich experience. At the  time I didn   t realize what a privilege it was. It added a new dimension to  our lives, and because of that experience I   m a bigger person than  otherwise, is what I would say.  What kind of impact do you think it had on your family as a whole?  30  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Larson  Jackson  Our overseas living broadened our viewpoint so that we can understand  other countries. We understand a lot of positions that they are in that we  wouldn   t have thought of, wouldn   t be able to think about even, because  we just wouldn   t have thought of it. We were exposed to a lot of things  like that.  And your daughters had the chance growing up to live in different  cultures and be exposed to that, too.  They have a different viewpoint from their peers because of that.  Would you do it over again?  Yes, I would.  If you had the chance to make the decision again     Yes, I would do it over again.  Now, once you were back in Oklahoma, what did your family do after  the seventeen and a half years in Thailand?  Well, my family, of course, Sherrie had a job and my other daughter  Charlynn was married, so they already had their lives started.  They were set up.  They were set up. Yes. And from Thailand we went to Arkansas. Ben  had sabbatical leave, and then after we were in Arkansas at Fayetteville,  we went to Mississippi for about five years, where he worked in rice.  Was that at the university there?  At the experimental station. Then, after we were there for five years, we  came to Tulsa. I was ready to go and settle down (laughs) and see my  girls and see my grandchildren and be part of the family again.  So that   s how you got back to Oklahoma.  That   s how we got back.  Well, is there anything else you want to mention while we   re talking?  I think that we were guided by the Lord to do this. I think that we were  not mature Christians, but we were striving to be good Christian people,  and to follow the Lord. I think that whatever effort we tried, God  31  Larson  Jackson  Larson  honored that. He blessed the people through us. That is my thinking on  it, is that, because the Lord works in many ways, and I   m grateful to be a  child of God.  I think that   s a good note to end on, and I   d like to thank you so much  for your time, and to Sherrie Jackson, who is also here helping out in  silent ways, we appreciate her presence as well. Thank you for  participating.  Yes.  You were wonderful, thank you.  -------  -------
