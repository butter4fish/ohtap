Speaker 1: We're going to start with a few kind of People magazine questions.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: They might seem a little silly so, you can just bear with us.  First of all, we'd like to know, what's your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food?  Gumbo, probably.  A good pot of gumbo, if I had one last meal, I think that's what I would want.
Speaker 1: I agree.  And, your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Spring.  I think spring sort of, when it's starting to get warm and the grass is green, and I think spring is my favorite time of year.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Good.  Your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite color is probably blue.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, when you going on vacation, what's your favorite destination?
Speaker 2: Anyplace where there are fish.  I'm an avid fisherperson so, I love to go someplace where there's water and I can throw a line in and try to catch some fish.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Wonderful.  And, your favorite phrase--Oops!
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Our favorite--your favorite phrase or saying.  Do you have one?
Speaker 2: Nothing comes to mind.  That's interesting.  I must have one but, nothing's coming to mind, and--
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's, that's fine.  Thank you--
Story_ID: 191541
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, we're gonna talk a little bit about your family.  Your background.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Could you please tell me about your mother?  What was her name and where was she born?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Wanzie, W-A-N-Z-I-E, Henderson, and she was born in Bude, Mississippi, B-U-D-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did she grow, she grew up there also?
Speaker 2: She grew up in Bude until the family moved to Shreveport, Louisiana.  Her father, my grandfather was a preacher, and he moved around a bit.  And, I'm--there were some other stops between Bude and Shreveport that I don't know about.  But, she, when she was probably five or six, she ended up in Louisiana and eventually in Shreveport.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Thank you.  How would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: Very hard-working, very serious woman who I think that her goal in life was to have her son.  I was an only child.  Make something of myself and that's what I remember most about her; was working hard.  She would go out and clean houses each day.  That was her job.  Come home, cook, and I was doing homework in there and she was ironing and I just remember her working hard most of her life.  Or, most of my childhood, certainly.
Speaker 1: Did she ever share any of her stories about growing up with you?
Speaker 2: Some.  Some of them.  Not a lot.  She wasn't much of a talker.  She just died last year, and I spent a lot of time with her as she--and we did a lot of reviewing of this.  And, one of the things I recall was that we didn't talk a lot.  She was a person of few words.
Story_ID: 191542
Speaker 1: Could you tell me something about your father?  What was his name and where was he born?
Speaker 2: His name was Eugene.  My middle name is after him.  Marion, M-A-R-I-O-N, Henderson, and he was born in Texas; Tyler, Texas.
Speaker 1: You know when?  What year?  The date?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry,--
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's--
Speaker 2: I don't remember that, right now.
Speaker 1: Do you know he--where he grew up?
Speaker 2: He grew up in Texas, and ended up in Louisiana in Shreveport where he met my mother [Wanzie Henderson].  And, he actually met her, he was--my mother was one of nine children.  She had five brothers and my father used to hang out with a couple of my uncles, and met my mother through that.  And, and they got married, and I was born.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he ever tell you any of his, any stories about his growing up?
Speaker 2: Again, not really.  It's interesting, I wasn't that close to my father as it turned out.  They separated when I was three years old.  And, my--the whole family, my mother's side of the family all moved to Los Angeles when I was three.  And, for three years, they were separated.  And, then my father came out and joined--they got back together when I was six.  And, stayed together until I was in high school and then they divorced permanently.  But, there wasn't closeness.  My father was a fairly harsh disciplinarian and I sort of stayed away from him as best I could, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did he do for a living?
Speaker 2: He was a janitor, primarily.  Yeah.  And, during the war for a short while, he and my mother got a job at one of the aircraft plants when those kinda jobs opened up to blacks, temporarily.  But, all the rest of the time, he did janitorial work.
Story_ID: 191543
Speaker 1: Do you know anything about your grandparents on your mother's [Wanzie Henderson] side?
Speaker 2: Just, I knew my grandmother, who was a very religious person, was a pillar of her church.  My grandfather, her husband, as I said was a minister.  And, he didn't come out to [Los Angeles] California with my grandmother.  They--it's not clear to me whether they divorced or she just left.  But, all I know about my grandfather on that side, was that he was a minister.
Speaker 1: Do you remember--recall their names?
Speaker 2: Estelle, my grandmother's name was Estelle [ph.], and my grandfather's name was John [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Thank you.  And what about your paternal grandparents?
Speaker 2: I don't know them.  My paternal grandmother was Mama Molly [ph.] (laughter).  I remember that, I, when I was a kid, she would come from Texas and visit a couple of times.  So, her name was Molly.  And, I saw her probably up until my teens.  And, then she never visited again, and I never got back to Texas.  And, I never met my grandfather on that side and I don't know his name.  That was one of those--I wanted to do a history of my family.  But, I never really got around--I should know all of these things, but I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Story_ID: 191544
Speaker 1: When you were--what's your earliest memory when you were growing up?  The first thing you recall when you were little.
Speaker 2: First thing I recall--
Speaker 1: Yes, that you--
Speaker 2: Was living on 27th Street in Los Angeles [California], and sort of being around, it was a, seemed like a big house then.  I've gone back and it wasn't that big.  Most of the kids lived there.  And, I just remember being in this house with my uncles and aunts coming in and out, and dancing.  And, you know, this fun loving group and my being a little kid hanging around the fringes of that.  Another clear memory for me about that time, well, my mother [Wanzie Henderson] lived-in service, as they said then.  She lived with the family that she worked for.  And, she would come home once a month for a weekend.  And, I remember those visits of my mother was coming.  And, I'd like to think it was because she was coming but, I think also because she always brought a nice present.  I remember those things very clearly, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, what was your, your family life like that?  You said your mother was gone a lot and you were living with--
Speaker 2: I was--
Speaker 1: Your aunts and uncles.  So, what was, what was the life like?
Speaker 2: I was raised by my grandmother [Estelle (ph.)] during those years.  I lived with my grandmother.  And, as I said, it was, she was a matriarch of the family, and there were nine kids.  And, I just remember very busy uncles in and out.  The daughters there cooking, going off to work, and then as they got older and married, there were fewer and fewer in the house.  But, it was, seemed to be a very happy existence, and interesting enough, I have no sense of poverty.  Although I now know we were very poor.  But, I didn't have a sense of that, 'cause we seemed to eat okay, and I seemed to have clothes.

Speaker 1: You grew up in South Central Los Angeles [California]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  South Central, L.A., right.
Speaker 1: Could you tell us what it was like?  What the, what it was like at that time?
Speaker 2: Again, it was--I had no sense of being in a ghetto, I mean, it was just a neighborhood.  It was all black, of course.  I think most people probably did the kind of work my mother [Wanzie Henderson] did.  They were janitors, and cleaning house, and menial jobs.  But, everyone seemed to be happy, the kids that we played, and it all seemed normal at the time.  As I look back on it, I think, it was--we weren't that well off.  And, one of the stories I've told over the years is that, I think the rich guy in the neighborhood was Mr. Reid [ph.], who had a job at the [U.S.] Post Office.  And, the Reid family, they were sort of the hierarchy of the neighborhood.  That's--
Speaker 1: When you would go out to play with your friends, what did the children in the neighborhood do?
Speaker 2: We would, it's so different from now.  I live in a neighborhood now in Berkeley [California] and there are a number of kids and they don't know each other.  And, they go off in play groups.  It's quite amazing to me.  When I grew up, you'd go out whenever, you know, time to go out, usually a weekend.  And, you know, sort of make a little noise or have a football and kick it, and the next things you know, someone down the street is out.  And, the kids start coming out and you start playing.  Depending on how old we were, early on, you'd play hide and go seek, or tag, or kickball, for something like that.  In later years, we might play softball, or football, touch football.  All of this in the streets, asphalt streets.  There weren't any playgrounds in the, you know, reasonably near.  So, it wasn't like going down the street to a park.  So, we played in the street there.
Story_ID: 191546
Speaker 1: Was the church, was your family a church, did they go to church often?  Was a church a part of your life?
Speaker 2: The church was integral to my grandmother's [Estelle (ph.)] life.  She went to church virtually every day, and they called her, "mother herring," and she was a centerpiece of her church.  My mother [Wanzie Henderson] on the other hand, when she did talk, I came to know that she--'cause my father [sic, grandfather] was a strict Baptist minister, she resented it very much.  She grew up, she couldn't drink coke.  She couldn't go to movies because of the religion, and she resisted that very much.  And, so, she--once she broke free from her father, she had nothing further to do with church.  Now, when I was growing up, when we bought the house that I grew on, 219 East 43rd Street [Los Angeles, California], there was a church down on the corner.  Actually, two doors away; Second A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] Church.  And, rather than take the responsibility of my growing up with no church background, I went to Sunday school there.  And, I grew up going to Sunday school but not to church.  And, I did that until I was fifteen at which point I was a fairly good baseball player by then.  And, I started playing semi-pro baseball on Sunday mornings.  And that was my last real experience with church.  So, I didn't grow up in--beyond that and being involved with the church.
Story_ID: 191547
Speaker 1: Are there any sights, or sounds, or smells when you come in contact with them, they remind you of your childhood?
Speaker 2: Let's see, sight.  I remember I can go into, I remember going to my grandmother's house.  And, it always smelled of good food; fried chicken, fried fish, collard greens and there are places I will go that will remind me of my grandmother's house, as I just said.  Good--somebody's been cooking here, there's some lingering smells from the kitchen smell.  Those I remember fondly, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Thank you.  Do you have any other memories of growing up that you'd like to share with us?
Speaker 2: Probably a lot of them.  I'm not sure which ones to mention here.  I remember one of the, probably the memory that's most relevant is feeling different.  I think, I've always felt like and outsider growing up.  And, the thing I've never be able to account for is that my mother, my family said I grew up talking like I talk now.  And, with kids, many of them who'd just come out from the South, talking quite different.  I never had a southern accent.  And, it distanced me from the kids.  The kids would mock me and say, "Oh, well (unclear)," you know, as if I talked proper.  And, I remember growing up sort of being weird.  And, also because I studied and I was kind of serious and couldn't dance.  Through high school, I just was in a school where everybody could boogie and dance.  So, I remember that as probably the dominant feature of my childhood as sort of being on the outside, never really on the inside.  I think, the thing that saved me socially was that I was a good athlete.  And, kids give a lot of slack to a good athlete.  So, I was captain of the high school football team.  And, that carried me a long way.  So much so that, they, you know, I didn't have a girlfriend, I was much too shy.  But, they made up one for me.  The word was that, "Oh, he's dating someone at this other high school across town."  So, it was sort of an interesting childhood in that sense.  I look back on it, I think it was probably good because I think I got the kind of grades and things that got me to college [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California], probably because of that.
Story_ID: 191548
Speaker 1: What was the name of the elementary school you attended?
Speaker 2: Trinity, Trinity Street Elementary or grammar School [Trinity Street Elementary School, Los Angeles, California].  I can't remember what it was called. Which was about fifteen blocks or so from where I lived.
Speaker 1: Did you have to walk to school?
Speaker 2: I did.  In fact, one of the memories I have was that first day at school.  It was very scary.  My mother was working.  My aunt was taking care of me and I remember flicking back, telling me how to get there.  So, you go down to San Pedro [Street, Los Angeles, California] and you go down to such and such, and I remember walk--very scared walking there by myself.  And, getting to school that first day, reporting wherever I did, I can't remember.  And, then the first day in the homeroom, the teacher introducing me to the other kids.  And, then lunchtime came, and they'd given me some money, I can't remember how much.  A quarter or something.  And, all the kids breaking for lunch and I sort of didn't know what to do.  And, I was sitting there and the teacher said, "Well," you know, "Don't you have lunch?"  And, I said, "No, I didn't bring any."  And, don't know why didn't say, I don't have a quarter.  So, the teacher gave me a half of sandwich that she had.  It was very--I was very shy.  And, so, I remember that first day.  It was a very traumatic day sort of, you know, frightening day for me.
Speaker 1: What were the teachers like at your school?
Speaker 2: Back in those days, all the teachers were white.  They were nice enough.  Except for one teacher, Mrs. Foats [ph.] that I convinced didn't like me.  And, I had trouble with her.  The other teachers were nice and accommodating and I think supportive, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: I think from what I've said, I probably made it sound like I was a better student than I was.  I think I was reasonably smart.  But, I got away with that.  And, I don't think I really worked particularly hard but, I could get Bs and As, I think.  And, I sort of gauged it as to what I could get away with and get a B or an A.
Story_ID: 191549
Speaker 1: When you were very young, what were your dreams and your aspirations?
Speaker 2: I thought about that many times, and I think I'm accurately reflecting what were my dreams at the time, as opposed to what I am now saying.  But, I think, you know, I think I can say, like, Abe Lincoln [President Abraham Lincoln] said, "Everything I am or every hope to be, I owe to my mother."  My mother, drummed in me, again, in a neighborhood where even the most ambitious kid's parents wanted them to be a teacher maybe or, you know, probation officer.  That seemed to be what blacks could aspire to and attain.  And, my mother said, "No, you're gonna be a, you're gonna be a professional.  You're gonna be a lawyer or a doctor."  And, I think I grew up thinking I had no choice at best.  And, I can't remember whether I really wanted to do it.  But, I grew up assuming that was what I was going to do.  And, the decision between those came when I started taking science courses and chemistry, and I really hated them.  So, that eliminated medicine.  And, I think that's how I became a lawyer.
Story_ID: 191550
Speaker 1: When you finished elementary school, did you go to junior high school, or high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I finished elementary school [Trinity Street Elementary School, Los Angeles, California] which was, as I said, about fifteen blocks from my home.  It was primarily black but they had some Mexican kids, and a few Asian, and very few white.  When, I graduated from Trinity, again, my mother [Wanzie Henderson]--the school nearest me, the junior high was a new school that had just opened up and was named George Washington Carver [Junior high, later, George Washington Carver Middle School, Los Angeles, California].  Carver Junior High, which as Chris Rock says, "So, you know that's a black school."  And, but, my mother and I think it were the reality back then, was that the white schools in Los Angeles were clearly superior.  The teachers were better.  The education was better.  And, my mother had me go to school across town to John Adams Junior High, which was mostly white.  And, I did that for the three years there.  Walked to school and sometime I would take the street car.  And, it was a long ways away.  But, I would walk every day, and went to John, John Adams Junior High [later, John Adams Middle School, Los Angeles, California].  After John Adams, and there I took algebra, geometry, and things like that.  And, I think, I got a pretty good education.  And, then when it came time to go to high school, the feeder school for John Adams, was again, one of the all-white schools on the West side of LA [Los Angeles].  But, I--by then I was a pretty good athlete, and they had a rule in Los Angeles, if not in California, that I could not play against my neighborhood school.  So, if I went to [Susan Miller] Dorsey High School [Los Angeles, California], which I wanted to go to, I could have done that.  But, I wouldn't been able to play football.  Because, they were in the same league with [Thomas] Jefferson High [School, Los Angeles, California], my neighborhood school.  And, I wouldn't've been able to play.  And, it was one of the few times I rebelled against my mother, you know.  Said, "Well, you're going to Dorsey."  "No.  I'm, I wanna play football."  And, I sort of cried and did all kinds of thing and she relented and let me go to Jefferson High, which was virtually all-black.  And, one of the advantages there is that I was quite a bit ahead of the kids there who had gone to Carver because, I had had these classes.  I had algebra and things and, so, again, I was able to coast a bit when I got to Jefferson High on what I had done at--learned at John Adams.
Story_ID: 191551
Speaker 1: So, were you able to play football there?
Speaker 2: I was able to play football.  I played football and baseball at Jeff[erson High School, Los Angeles, California] and as I said earlier, my last year I became captain of the football team.  And, you know, I've often said, I just gave a speech couple of weeks ago with my alma mater, Boalt Hall Law School [University of California Berkeley School of Law, Berkeley, California], and I was telling the students that as I--they had asked me to talk about my life.  How I got to where I am.  And, I said, "You know, I think, I think of 'Forrest Gump' when I think of my life."  Because, a lot of fortunate things happened, if you saw that movie, you know.  Forrest Gump was a man of modest means who met Elvis Presley and indeed inspired him to do the wiggle, you know.  All of those things that--and, in a sense, I had a number of fortunate things happen to me.  And, the earliest I can think of was that one day after football practice, my last year, a wonderful man who's passed on, Isaac McCullen [ph.], who was a counselor, came out on the football field and met me and said, "Have you ever thought about going to college?"  And, I said, "Yeah.  I have."  But, the general path of students out of Jefferson was to go to LA City College [Los Angeles City College, Los Angeles, California] and start that track.  And, so, I was sort of thinking along those terms.  And, he--I had just gotten a good grade on the Iowa Test [of Basic Skills], which was a test they gave to all the high school kids, and he thought I was college material.  And, to my great fortune, he was a UC Berkeley [University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, California] graduate and, he actually steered me.  Gave--filled out my papers, and sent an application to UC Berkeley, which changed my life in a very meaningful way.
Story_ID: 191552
Speaker 1: You had mentioned that when you were fifteen, you became a semi-ballplayer.  Could you tell--describe that experience for us.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I loved to play baseball.  And, actually, it's interesting I think I've mentioned that I got a football scholarship to Cal [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California].  But, I was actually a better baseball player.  But, keep in mind, we're talking about the days before Jackie Robinson came up.  So, there weren't any real opportunities for black players to certainly to get to the major leagues.  So, but, there were a lot of players playing in city leagues.  And, I began playing at Ross Snyder playground in east LA [Ross Snyder Recreation Center, Los Angeles, California].  And, had some older players there, including some players--[James Raleigh] "Biz" Mackey who was one of the great catchers.  You'll hear about him, he's caught [Leroy Robert] "Satchel" Paige and peo--he was at this time in his fifties but still, and he would play in this league.  And, he was--hang around, so I was playing with these kinds of guys as a fifteen-year-old.  And, played shortstop and was a good fielder, and finally, one of the teams asked me to tryout.  I'd tried out and I made shortstop, and starting playing on Sundays, which was this league.  And, so, I would play every Sunday.  We would go around town and play.  Interestingly enough, mostly white teams.  We were one of the few black teams in the league.  And, I did this until I went to high school and started playing baseball regularly for the high school team, and got too busy for semi-pro.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, your high school was Jefferson High [School, Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: Jefferson High, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, so, you played on their sports teams?
Speaker 2: I played on their team.  I played baseball and football.  Interesting thing about that, I actually, when I went to Jefferson, I'd planned to run track.  I learned something, I told you I went across town to John Adams Junior High [School, Los Angeles, California] and I exaggerate over the years in telling the story.  But, I was, like, the fastest thing they had ever seen.  I was one of the few blacks there.  And, I was really fast.  So, when I went to Jefferson, which had great track teams, and Jefferson used to win the city championship in track every year, and very often the state.  I was gonna run track.  Until I went out and, I think, half the student body could beat me running at Jefferson, although I was fast at John Adams.  So, I went to the other sports.
Story_ID: 191553
Speaker 1: What was the academic life like at Jefferson [High School, Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: It wasn't, it wasn't rigorous at all.  Some of the teachers would sort of, I think, look at--would humor us rather than teach us.  And, they were into discipline as much as they were teaching.  I remember a few teachers would sort of bring candy bars and bribe students to be quiet.  So, but, there were a few good teachers and some that I remember.  My English teacher, was--I liked her a lot and some place in a box I have--I won the English prize for the school that year.  They--Latin, I took Latin.  The Latin teacher; that was a joke.  And, I was telling someone recently, a young kid that I've come to know, is now taking Latin.  And, I said, "All I remember from Latin is the conjugation, which I still-- orum, este, musta, ent [ph.].  And, that seems to be all he (laughter) ever taught us.  So, it was a mixed education.  Some of the teachers I look back on, and I think, they probably didn't even wanna be at Jefferson High, teaching.  And, others were conscientious, dedicated teachers.  And, what that resulted with me, was sort of a mixed education, especially playing football.  So, that, when Mr. McCullen [ph.] came out that day, and said, "Are you interested in going to college?  Or, have you ever thought about it?"  And, we started pursuing getting into Cal [University of California, Berkeley, California], I actually, got admitted to Cal with the condition that I go to summer school at Cal and take two courses in which I had to get a B and a C.  And, so, I came up to Cal in the summer and came up to play football, but I took two courses; geology and history 4A.  And, geology was a snap because it was what I had done.  It was multiple choice and true and false kinds of questions about cumulus clouds, and rock formations.  And, my first exam in history, I'll always remember it, it was give the significant of Napoleon's [Napoleon Bonaparte] blockade of the English coast.  And, I just drew a blank.  I had never had a, an essay question in my life.  So, I didn't know what to do with it.  And, I started writing, you know, well, Napoleon was short, and he was born here, and he was married, you know.  I'm just giving facts, which is all I'd ever been taught to deal with.  And, I got a D plus on the exam, and the professor wrote the note to come see the professor.  And again, this is another part of the 'Forrest Gump' tale of people coming into my life and affecting it.  This wonderful man called me in, and he said, "I should've given you an F, son.  You didn't answer the question.  But, I know you studied.  'Cause I wrote the text book we're using and you told me half the things in the textbook."  But, you--and he started talking, he said--there weren't many black at Cal in those days and so I think, he was curious as to who I was and how I got there.  I told him I was up there to play football.  And, he said, "Well, then, won't the football team pay for a tutor for you?"  And, I said, "Well, I don't know."  He said, "Well go ask."  I went to the Athletic Department, they said, "Yeah."  And, so, I went back and he said, "Okay."  His teaching assistant, he--they hired him as my tutor.  And, first thing he did was show me some A papers and it started becoming clear.  "Oh, this is what you're looking for."  And, he tutored me and I was able to pull that D plus up and get a C in history, and I got a B in geology.  And, that's how I got into Cal for September.
Story_ID: 191554
Speaker 1: I just wanna go back a little bit.  When you were at--still in high school [Jefferson High School, Los Angeles, California], I'm sorry, who--were there--who were the students, the other students?  Were there--did you have any friends among the other students?  What were they like?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, I had good friend.  Most of my friends were the athletes.  I hung out with the athletes.  And, they lived around town.  I would mostly meet them at school.  And, again, I think because I, I've never been able to look back and understand this.  I wasn't a party guy and I didn't hang out and so my social life was at school.  I'd go to school, I'd meet my buddies, we'd play football, and I remember after football, most of the kids lived in a different part of L.A. [Los Angeles].  And, we would walk down the street and I'd maybe walk ten blocks beyond and then I'd (unclear) and come back home.  And, then that was it for the night.  I don't remember being on the phone, talking to kids.  I don't remember hanging out.  I'd go home and there I was with me and my mother [Wanzie Henderson].  And, I'd be reading in the living room.  This is pre-television, and that was the rest of the night.  So, those were my friends.  But, they were wonderful friends.  Some of them I'm still in touch with.

Speaker 1: All right. So, you've graduated from high school [Jefferson High School, Los Angeles, California] and you've gone to summer school.  You're going to enter college.  Did you have any i- what were you going to study?  What were you plans when you went to college?
Speaker 2: When I went to college, as I said, I think, by then I knew I was gonna be a lawyer and not a doctor.  And, I think those were the two choices I saw.  And, I was willfully prepared to go to college.  My mother--nobody in my family had ever gone to college, and I think, most of them had not graduated from high school.  So, I was going in cold, not knowing what it was other than it sounded good.  So, that the first day at Cal in registration, they had it outside, and you'd go to tables and they'd have letters of E to H or something.  And, you'd get your cards and you'd fill them out.  And, finally I got to a table and one of the cards said--one of the students that they'd hired to help with his process said, "What's you major?"  She was filling it out.  And, I said, "Law."  And, I still remember this sort of condescending look, "Law is a graduate major.  You're an undergraduate."  And, I tell you, I didn't know the difference at that point, between graduate and undergraduate.  I--and, I didn't know what my major was.  So, she said, "Well, come back when you figure out your major."  And, I walked off totally bewildered.  And, at this time, if you're--University of California [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California], one of the biggest schools in the nation at the time, had about less than twenty blacks going.  So, I wandered around, I found one, and another one of lucky strokes of mine, I ran into Julius Devereaux.  And, I said, "Well, what's your major?"  And, he said, "Poli sci."  And, I said, "What's poli sci?"  He said, "Political science."  And, he told me a little about it.  And, I went back, and my major was political science.  And, I've always thought over these years, he had a brother named Joe Devereaux who was an engineering major (laughter).  And, I've often wondered if I'd bumped into Joe, would I had been an engineering major.  I mean, I was that naive.  I was, in fact, I'll tell you another story.  Cal was so big, when I went to summer school, the football team registered me and did all of that for me and I lived in a boarding house there near campus.  And, the first day, our class was at 101 Dwinelle.  And, I went around looking for Dwinelle Street.  I thought that was an address.  I was--it's a miracle that I'm sitting here and you're interviewing me, and I survived all of that ignorance I brought to college.  But, anyway, that's the way I started off.
Story_ID: 191556
Speaker 1: So what was college life like for you?
Speaker 2: I've described my mother [Wanzie Henderson] earlier on.  I think life was grim with her.  It was making things work and meet.  I think college [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] was like that with me.  If you talk to any of the old friends that they will tell you that, "[HM The Honorable] Thelton [E. Henderson] didn't go to the parties, he studied all the time."  And, I was afraid of failure.  I studied and Mr. McCullen [ph.] had told me that, you know, it's gonna be challenging and I needed to study, and they'd be times I'd wanna give up, you know.  And, he gave a great pep talk and I remembered all that.  And, he had told me that, you know, one measure to make sure I did it, was to study three hours out of class for every hour in class.  And, that's what I did.  And, so, I didn't look up for air until I had studied.  And, then usually this was Friday or something, or Saturday when I got in my hours of study.  Then, I'd look up and I might go to a movie or I might do something.  But, I still couldn't dance.  So, I avoided the parties.  I mean, I was, you know, so, I was square.  And, I said the only reason I--if I hadn't been a football player, I'd been dismissed and laughed at by everybody.  But, you didn't do it with an athlete.  But, that was so--life was I say grim now.  I had fun, and I had buddies.  And, I hung out with the athletes but, that's what I remember.  It was a grind.  I remember, grinding my first year.  I joined a group called project PIC.  Which was a group of students that were going to travel that summer to Pakistan, India, and Ceylon [later, Sri Lanka].  And, that was the pic, P-I-C.  And, I survived and I got on it.  And, then I realized that I had to work in the summer, even though I had the scholarship.  And, I remember I had to get off the project and not go.  'Cause I wasn't sure how I was gonna live if I went there, they would pay those expenses, but I'd come back to school without any money.  And, so, I, that's what I remember college as a lot of doing without, trying to survive, year-to-year.
Story_ID: 191557
Speaker 1: --You were a political science major.
Speaker 2: Political science.
Speaker 1: What other classes did you take?
Speaker 2: One class I took that I remember particularly well.  One of the great professors there, a lot of students actually, a few years ago, they started a tenbrook society in honor of this man.  He was Jacob, Jacobus Tenbrook [ph.] who taught rhetoric.  And, he was a lawyer, and anybody who wanted to go to law school, it was a pre-law major, took his course.  And, he was wonderful.  And, I remember that, and I was in his course a week, and this happened to other students before I realized he was blind.  He would walk into (unclear).  I remember one of the first classes, he'd walk into class and, now I can see it.  He sort of had this look of not looking at any--but, it didn't really--and, the first class he would say, "You know there's a rule against smoking."  He'd smell the smoke, and you thought he was looking right (laughter)--he was a remarkable man.  I remember those as one of my favorite classes of going through the rhetoric and the logic and the reasoning process that one does in law school.  Another class, and all of these people are dead, Garth Wilson [ph.], was an English professor who befriended me; taught me how to write.  He thought I had a little talent and spent extra time with me on writing and things like that.  So, I remember those courses particularly well.
Speaker 1: What about political science?
Speaker 2: It's interestingly enough, I don't remember (laughter), I took them and I enjoyed them, but I remember these courses better.  The thing I remember about political science was getting a B plus in a class instead of the A.  Because, it was an essay about the political campaign that Adlai Stevenson, and I misspelled Stevenson through the exam.  I forget whether its--I still don't know how to spell it.  Whether it was a S-t-e-v-e-n, or S-t-e-p-h.  I spelled it the other way, and the professor telling me that he had deducted a half grade for that (laughter).  But, anyway, I don't remember a memorable poli sci [political science] class.  I remember taking it and it was painless but, I remember these courses as the things I liked and enjoyed, and looked forward to, and think I really learned something useful.
Story_ID: 191558
Speaker 1: So, you came to school [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] to play football.  So, how was football?
Speaker 2: Football was fun.  I came up and played freshmen football.  And, then in my sophomore year, I was playing and then I think it was the fifth game of the year, I got hurt.  I got a knee injury.  Someone clipped me in the game, and that was the end of my career.  Which is probably good in retrospect because I was small as you can see, and I was fast.  And, I probably would have played four years of football and gotten a C plus average.  And, then when I applied to law school, I wouldn't have gotten into a good one like Boalt Hall [University of California Berkeley School of Law, Berkeley, California].  So, I don't think that was somebody again, was looking out for me.  I became a full-time stu--well, I played baseball.  But, that was less demanding.  I became a better student and ended up getting the kind of grades that got me into a good law school.  But, there was a saying, the reason I--I wasn't hurt in a way that I couldn't play anymore.  But, it was a saying in football, that there's room in football for a big slow guy, and there's room in football for a little fast guy.  But, there's no room in football for a little slow guy, (laughter).  And, when I had hurt my knee, I was slower then.  And, I thought I'd, you know, I was no longer the player I was, having lost a step with that knee injury.  So, I gave it up.
Story_ID: 191559
Speaker 1: So, you became this really good student and you've graduated from college [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California].  And, what was the next thing you did?
Speaker 2: I graduated from Cal.  I went there in 1951.  I would've ordinarily have graduated in June in '55 [1955] but, because of the knee injury, I missed a semester.  I was in the hospital for six weeks.  And, so, I graduated in January of '56 [1956].  And, I was gonna go to law school in September.  But, when I hurt my knee, I was in the ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] and I quit the ROTC, because I became 4F and ineligible for the draft.  But, then, when I graduated, without my knowing it, they reclassified me 1A and drafted me (laughter).  And, so, instead of going to law school, I went into the [U.S.] Army.  They drafted me in June of '56 [1956] and I went into the Army for two years.  A perfectly miserable experience.  I hated the Army; resented being there.  But, I went in as a private and came out as a corporal.  And, then, I thought I needed some money by then.  So, I worked a year down in Santa Monica [California] at a place called Sussman Development Corporation [ph.] which was a spin off from the RAND Corporation.  And, I worked for a year, and then I went to Boalt Hall [University of California Berkeley School of Law, Berkeley, California].  Began Boalt Hall in September of 1959.
Story_ID: 191560
Speaker 1: Was Boalt Hall [the University of California Berkeley School of Law, Berkeley, California], was that the only law school you had applied to?
Speaker 2: Again, Yeah.  I just didn't know how things worked.  And, I didn't realize that it was probably at that time, the best law school in the West, and hard to get into.  But, it's the only school I applied to.  I've often thought, if I had not gotten in there, I probably would have had to wait a year, start over, and apply to other schools.  But, I did apply there and I got in.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, what was Boalt Hall like?
Speaker 2: It was a daunting experience.  I--by then, most people think I'm modest.  And, I seemed to be modest but, by then I, I was sort of a private little thing, hey, I'm pretty smart.  'Cause I've gotten good grades, and had come from this background that I've described, and I thought, Okay, now I'm in law school, I'm really gonna study.  I'm not playing sports.  I'm gonna really lay it to them.  And, I was surprised that, you know, everybody was smart there and again, it was a struggle.  I did what I always do.  I studied as hard as I could, and I think that the thing that happened that saved me.  It was going along fast and I was briefing and doing all the things; I was in a study group.  But, in those days, fortunately for me, when the Christmas vacation came, they gave you a two week break.  And, then you'd come back for exams.  And, I think, it's the best thing that ever happened to me, because most of the people went home and I was too frightened to go home.  I stayed and continued to study and all of a sudden I realized that I was a little out of it.  I mean, I didn't, you know, a little behind, and it all started falling into place.  I started reviewing and I remember saying, "Oh, that's what the professor was," and I think that saved me.  So, by the time that two weeks was up, I had my act together.  And, I did okay.  But, I've often wondered if they had the system now, where you go right into finals, I think I wouldn't've done nearly as good.  I might have even flunked out.  I just don't know.
Story_ID: 191561
Speaker 1: You had mentioned when you first started, when you were in [University of California] Berkeley [Berkeley, California], there weren't a lot of black students at that time.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: What about in Boalt Hall [University of California Berkeley School of Law, Berkeley, California]?
Speaker 2: That was worse.  At Boalt Hall, I was in the first class in the history of Boalt Hall that had two blacks in it.  They had, I think, another fellas down study and as best we can tell, I was the seventh black to graduate from Boalt Hall, in the history.  So, it was a rare, rare thing for blacks to go to Boalt at that point in time.
Speaker 1: During this time, this is like in the late '50s [1950s], early '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: No.  This was at--I started Boalt Hall in '59 [1959].  So, and, when I started in '59 [1959] there were two blacks in my class.  There was one black in the second year, and none in the third year.  By the time I got out in '62 [1962], there were the two.  There was one behind me, Henry Ramsey [Jr.], and then there was one behind him.  So, there was--and, things didn't change dramatic until '68 [1968], when [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] was assassinated.  And, then institutions started looking around and saying, you know, we have to do more.  And, I think, they started admitting more blacks.
Speaker 1: When you, when you were at, in school, were you interested in politics outside?  Things that were going on with blacks then, or anything (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not really.  Not really.  I was--I kept my nose to the grindstone.  I studied and, you know, would hang out a bit.  But, no.  I didn't do a lot of extracurricular things, including politics.
Story_ID: 191562
Speaker 1: How was taking the [State of California] bar [examination]?  How'd you do?  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I did okay.  It was, it was a very tough exam.  It's a two and half day exam, and someone had told me that it was rigorous and that I should treat not only the, the mental part of it; study and prepare for it.  But, that you get physically tired.  And, I'm glad I got that advice.  So, I would--I ate properly.  I started stating vitamin pills.  I would exercise.  I'd go for a walk during this whole period.  And, I think, it came to help me.  The last day of the exam, the last question had to do with contracts, which was my best subject.  I got As in contract throughout.  And, I was so tired.  I think my brain just almost shut down that I could barely think through it.  And, I think, if I hadn't done all this, I've always thought I would've shut down earlier.  And, who knows what would've happened.  It was a, it was a, it was a demanding exam.  But, I passed it.  And, I'll always remember passing it.  I took the exam and then I had a job with the Civil Rights Division of the [U.S.] Justice Department.  So, I went to Washington [D.C.] and started working in--they had an honors program where they took certain students from law schools around the country in an honors program.  They were all these bright kids from the West, I mean, from the East Coast; Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut], and Columbia [University, New York, New York].  And, they got their bar exam earlier.  So, people were walking around, they had passed.  And, they were saying, "Have you heard yet, [HM The Honorable] Thelton [E. Henderson]?"  And, I hadn't and the pressure started growing, you know, and it was my chance to be the class idiot, you know, if I fail.  And, I just remember--and finally it was snowing in Washington and I lived in a little rooming house when I first came.  And, I went down, walked down to the corner, okay, called home and said, "Has the Bar results come, mother?"  And, my mother who showed a rare sense of humor on this said, "Yeah, they came."  I said, "Well?"  Says, "Oh, I don't know.  Let me look and see."  And, then read the letter, "Dear," then I thought, Oh, she's holding the bad news.  But, she said I passed it.  And, I still remember skipping back to this rooming house in the snow, and I hated snow.  I was so--it was one of the happy days of my life, that I passed the bar exam.
Story_ID: 191563
Speaker 1: We'll go back to Boalt Hall [University of California Berkeley School of Law, Berkeley, California].  When you were there, what kind of law did you, were you thinking about going into?
Speaker 2: Strangely enough, when I started Boalt (laughter), I intended to be a tax lawyer of all things.  And, people are amazed at that seeing where my career actually went.  And, the reason for that is that when I played baseball at Cal [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California], a lot of the law school faculty would come out to watch the baseball games.  It was near the law school.  And, one of the biggest fans was a tax professor at Boalt Hall named Adrian Kragen, who befriended me and use to tell me, you know, "Looking forward to you coming up to Boalt."  He learned I was going to law school.  So, I went to Boalt thinking I was gonna be a tax lawyer, until I took Adrian Kragen's tax course.  And, one, I didn't have a knack for it, and it just was deadly boring.  So, I eliminated that.  But, I still didn't know what I was gonna do.  And, part of the reason for that though, you have to remember the times.  At that time, if you were graduating from Boalt Hall and you were black, the white law firms didn't interview you.  They would come to the school; they didn't interview blacks.  They didn't interview women.  These were the dark ages.  And, so, the typically future for a black student was, if you were lucky, my--I was thinking I would either go down to Los Angeles [California], or stay in the Bay Area [California].  And, what you did was find a successful black lawyer who would take you in; have some extra office space, give you the office down the hall, and give you extra cases.  Which was a euphemism for the dogs he had.  And, you try to make a living doing that until you built up your own practice.  That was what I was looking for.  That was what I was expecting to do.
Story_ID: 191564
Speaker 1: And, again, one of those fortunate circumstances in my life. One day in my last semester, I was walking down the hall and the dean, Dean William [Lloyd] Prosser, used to communicate.  He'd put a note on the blackboard said, "Mr. Henderson."  I took it, and it said, "Come in and see me."  And, I thought, Oh, well, I guess I have missed a couple of class this semester (laughter), you know.  And, I thought, what's he want with me?  Well, it turned out that the Kennedys [President John F. Kennedy and Robert Kennedy] were in and had this wonderful man who has been my mentor over the years now, John [Michael] Doar, who was the first assistant in the Civil Rights Division.  And, he had been going around the country and down south.  And, one of the things the administration wanted to do was integrate the government more.  And, he was going to U.S. attorneys and he was saying, "How many black do you have working for you?"  And, finally, one day one of them said, "How many blacks do you have working for you?"  And, he had never thought of--there had never been a black in the history of the Civil Rights Division working for him.  And, he thought, he better do something about that right away.  And, again, one of those being in the right place at the right time, he was an alumni of Boalt Hall [University of California Berkeley School of Law, Berkeley, California].  So, he called Dean Prosser and said, "Do you have any blacks working for you?"  And, I mean, "About to graduate?"  And, there was me, and the other fella and the dean gave him my name.  I think, I had better grades than the other guy.  And, he called me and didn't offer me a job, but offered me an interview.  And, I borrowed a hundred dollars from the loan office, flew back to Washington [D.C.], interviewed, and got the job.  And, that determined my career at that point.  I've often thought if that hadn't come along, I have no idea what, what I would've done.  And, I certainly don't think I would be a judge today had I not had that happy circumstance.
Story_ID: 191565
Speaker 1: So, what was Washington [D.C] like with the Kennedys [President John F. Kennedy and Robert Kennedy]?
Speaker 2: It was a very exciting place.  The town was interesting.  I'd grown up in [Los Angeles] California, and of course, there was no official segregation, you know.  Although there were economic seg--I lived on the east side of town.  That's where blacks lived.  But, for the first time, they were just restaurants, some restaurants still didn't serve blacks.  That was a shock to me.  One right across the street from the [U.S.] Justice Department that some of the guys went to until they realized they wouldn't serve me, and we stopped going there.  So, this was an interesting experience for me.  But, there were--I was talking to a young man recently who had worked one summer at the Civil Rights Division.  And, he was talking about a section he was in that had thirty or something people.  And, I shocked him, I said, "Do you know how many people we had in the entire Civil Rights Division in 1962, when I started?"  Seventeen lawyers in the entire division.  And, that's because the southern senators back then were powerful and they kept the budget down.  They limited the number by the budget.  So, it was a different day.  But, we seventeen were idealistic and we, we were gonna save the world by ourselves.  So, we worked.  I mean, it would--with pride, you know, if you left before nine or ten at night, you were a wimp.  And, that's what we did day in and day out, unless we were in the field.  And, I was single.  And, so, I started spending a lot of time in the field because most of the other guys were married.  So, I'd go down to the Kennedys where--focusing on voting rights where Bobby Kennedy was, and that was primarily in Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana.  So, we'd go down investigating patterns and practice of discrimination.  And, I probably at some point, I was out in the field 80 percent of the time.  Because, I would be in, say I was in Birmingham [Alabama] working on a case, and then I'd get a call that Frank Dunboss [ph.] say, you know, "Time to go home."  He'd been gone all week and the wife wanted him home.  So, I'd just go on over to where--Jackson, Mississippi.  And, so, I stayed out in the field quite a bit.  And, hardly had any social life in--I'm sounding pretty dull now aren't I?  No social life all the way through here.  But, I would come back in from the field, come to Washington [D.C.], sort of catch up, report in on my job, knew very few people.  I made a few friends eventually.  And I'd go back in the field again.  And, I did that almost until I had left.
Story_ID: 191566
Speaker 1: Could you tell us about some of your experiences in the field?
Speaker 2: Interesting experiences.  Let's--first time, my first field trip, and they had told me it's dangerous down there.  I was the first black that many of these southern cities didn't take well to someone coming down as an authority figure; a lawyer for the [U.S.] Justice Department.  I had to handle myself in a certain way.  So, they trained me on all that; keep a low profile.  So, my first trip was to the town I was born in, Shreveport [Louisiana], Caddo pen [ph.].  I don't think that was intentional.  I think it was accidental.  I was gonna work on a case in Caddo Parish, which is where Louisiana was.  And, flew into the airport, and I was so nervous, I rented a car, got in the car, started driving toward Shreveport.  Drove for maybe a half an hour and then I realized I never picked up my luggage.  I, you know, that's how nervous I was on this first trip.  So, I turned around and started heading back to the airport.  And, in a few minutes this light, this police light on, pulled me over and interestingly enough turned out that this was a super highway.  It was so wide that I was going the wrong way (laughter).  And, I was lucky it was at night.  He may have saved my life.  But, turned out to be a guy that scared the devil out of me.  Pull--got me out of the car, had a gun, said, "You got a knife on you boy?"  Just terrorized me.  "No."  Put my hands against the thing and took me in.  Took me into jail.  And, I still have in my scrapbook the ticket he gave me.  Which is a little pink slip, very poor, almost childlike writing, reckless carless.  I think he meant careless, says car C-A-R-L-E-S-S, and this ticket's in my Civil Rights scrapbook.  But, it was a terrorizing--it was my first experience there.  He was--and then we got in the car and he got on the radio and said, I got a one 'o, some code number and then I heard him say, "Nope.  He's sober as a judge."  See they were asking whether I was drunk.  And, took me in, and gave me the ticket and released me.  And, I had someone else, the other guy drive my car in.  They followed me and finally released me.  But, the thing I will always remember and it has informed some of my knowledge about police.  He started talking and I think he saw that I was a reasonable human being and started relating to me differently.  I said, "I'm from California and I'm a lawyer," didn't tell him I was with the government 'cause I thought that would be hostility.  But, then he started talking to me more like that.  And, she said, "Wow, you're Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California], huh?  Well, you know I used to be on the police force in Hayward [California]."  And, I said, "Yeah.  This is--I think there are people like you on these (unclear)."  And, I've never forgotten that in terms of one of life's lessons about the way the world works.
Story_ID: 191567
Speaker 1: One flowing from that, you know, I always wondered how I should've acted.  And, I got to know Dr. [Reverend Martin Luther] King [Jr.] during this period, and Dr. King used to sort of sidle up to me and say, things like, "You know the best thing that can happen to the Civil Rights Movement right now, [HM The Honorable] Thelton [E. Henderson], is if you know, if they go all up long side your head and beat you up 'cause you're a government attorney.  And, show the world that, you know, they don't just do it to these little kids that are marching and a (unclear) will they do it to you 'cause you're black."  And, I thought about that and I kept thinking, you know, gee maybe next time I get arrested rather than pull out my ID as this big--and they usually let me go or something, I'm gonna just take it for the [Civil Rights] Movement.  So, some while later, a few months later, I got arrested and I was gonna do it.  And, I think, I got arrested for nothing.  I say, "Driving while black," one of those kinds of tickets.  And, they took me in again, put someone in my car and drove me down to this little country store.  Which was sort of looked like it was a city hall, a country store, the police department, and his guy was really mean, southern, and said, "Let's see your driver's license."  I pulled out the driver's license which was in a plastic thing, and I held it out.  And, next thing I know, this billy club came and whacked me on the hand, and I still have this scar here, you know.  "Take it out of that plastic, nigger.  Don't you know how to show?"  And, blood started spurting out so I take it out, and I show him.  And, he writes me up and we're in the little town.  And, so, they again, they're gonna arrest me.  And, I get in the car, in my car this time, and they're driving me to the, to the county seat where the jail is.  And, I remember this was one of the most terrifying rides I've ever had because he put an old man who would--was in the store playing checkers to ride with me.  And, I don't know what that--and then he drove behind and followed me.  And, so, we were driving and we went through a wooded area.  And, this was about the time the three Civil Rights workers disappeared.  And, I started thinking, what's going on here.  They didn't know who I was.  And, I started fearing for my life.  I was gonna be driven in here and buried in this forest.  And, there were a lot of curves and I remember sort of measuring the guy behind.  And, I would do a curve, and I would speed up a little just, just to see, you know.  And, I started thinking that if they were gonna stop me, I was just gonna make a run for it and go and just get where ever I could, and jump in the middle of the street and say, "Hey."  I mean, that was my game plan.  And, just about the time--and the other thing I was thinking, this guy was quite old.  Although now that I look about it, he's probable as old as I am now (laughter), but he seemed really old.  And, I was thinking I'll punch him out and, you know, I was thinking actively about what I might do if they were gonna do something to me.  When finally, I came out of the wooded area, and came into this town and they took me into the jail, which was not like your jail here.  It was--and it looked to be in some sort of wooden structure, was almost like a house.  But, there was a cell there and it was the black cell.  And, I looked and it was a mattress on the floor and there was vomit on the floor and I thought, oh.  And, so, I thought, well--there's an article that I have that's in Jet Magazine about this.  So, I said, "Well, Dr. King (laughter), I'll sacrifice some other day," and I pulled out my ID.  And, then this deputy went out and went across the street.  And, one of the quotes I treasure all of these years, a sheriff came back.  And, he said, "Well, look at this sheriff."  And, looks at that and says, "Well, what are you?"  I said, "I'm an attorney with the Justice Department."  And, he said, "Well, boy with credentials like that, we'll treat you like any self-respecting white man."  And, let me go.  So, I've got too many stories for this one thing to tell that are similar to that.  But, it was quite an experience.

Speaker 1: The few times when you were in [Washington] D.C., what was it, what kind of work did you do in the office [Civil Rights Division, U.S. Justice Department]?
Speaker 2: We were doing researching for cases.  The way you tried a voting rights case was to look--you had to find a pattern in practice of discrimination.  And, what we would do is have the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] get the voting records from any particular community that we had targeted.  And, it, they would have all of the registered whites.  So, there would be a list, I mean, much longer than that, but that long.  And, all of the unregistered whites, which was a list like that.  All the registered blacks, which would be like that or non-existent.  And, all the unregistered, which was all the blacks in town.  And, you had to study these records.  What they did.  Their education and you look for the pattern of why the whites are registered and why the blacks--and that's how you build your case.  The next step was then to find certain people who sort of stood out as good examples.  That's when we would go down south.  We did this in Washington [D.C.].  And, then we'd go down south and interview, you know.  Someone for example, it wasn't uncommon to have someone with a masters from Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama] who couldn't qualify to vote.  And, you'd go interview them and get the story and that's, so that's what we were doing all the time.  Either working on this or preparing for an actual trial, which was trial briefs and briefing the witnesses.  But, that's what we were doing, pretty much, all the time.
Story_ID: 191569
Speaker 1: Having worked in the Civil Rights Movement, it must have affected the way you viewed life, the rest of your life.  How, how did work, this part of your life, how did it affect you?  How did it, did it change any, any way you thought or the way you acted, or any--
Speaker 2: I think it did.  And, I think it certainly that I was fairly naive about race and about discrimination even growing up in South Central LA [Los Angeles].  I think, I didn't really experience overt racism, and so I was pretty naive about it and all of a sudden, you know, here it was.  I was down south where it was very open.  And, it made me think differently, and I have something here on one of the window sills, which I framed.  I was in a doctor's office and I can't remember why.  And, it was literature on there like there is here.  And, there was booklet which I have framed over there, which said, "Ask yourself this important question.  What have I done to preserve segregation?"  And, I remember looking at that and there was a white citizen's counsel pamphlet, and I read it, and I took it.  And, somehow that struck me as, you know, I knew there was segregation.  But, somehow the notion that, they've preserved it so openly that this--they thought it was a duty down there.  This was in Selma, Alabama, I believe.  That somehow gave me a different perspective about the race problem that I hadn't had before.  And, I think, also the cruelty.  I mean, I was, I was down there in Birmingham [Alabama] when I--the police dogs were sicced on the kids.  And, they were sweeping them down the street and fire--with fire holes and you could see the hatred on the face.  And, that was a different experience for me.  So, I think that, probably a lot of the views I have now about race and segregation and discrimination were helped shaped during that experience.
Story_ID: 191570
Speaker 1: Another, very eye-opening thing, I was very naive about power.  And, so, I remember we had trouble with the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] on our civil rights cases.  And, I remember thinking, well, I had Bobby Kennedy [Robert Kennedy], the attorney general, and, you know, I would hear the complaints around there, "Well, we can't get J. Edgar Hoover to do this."  And, I thought, Well, Kennedy's his boss and I know he wants this, just make him do it, you know.  How naive, you didn't mess with Hoover.  So, just learning how the world works there.  And, one of the, I keep saying this, but one of the really memorable days I have and an experience with the FBI was, I was in Selma [Alabama], that's during the time [Revered] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was organizing and this was before the big march across the [Edmund] Pettus Bridge [Selma, Alabama].  But, he was organizing and he organized a big voting day, where the blacks were gonna go register to vote.  And, it was searing hot.  It was about a hundred degrees.  And, we had gotten a restraining order for them not to interfere with the voting.  And, the [U.S.] Post Office was right across the street from the county seat of government where the voting registration was going on.  Blacks dressed up and started going early and they were winding blocks; just hundreds of blacks come to register to vote.  And, the--what we learned mid-way through the morning was that they had gathered whites to register to vote too, and they were coming through the back door.  And, they let about one black an hour in, and you had, like, a thousand people ready; they would never get in.  And, we had the restraining order not to interfere.  But, they had also decided, you know, they could turn anything on its head.  That, if a black had to get out of line to go to the bathroom, had to go to the back of the line.  I mean, it was just--and they couldn't get out to get water or drinks, and it was.  So, some SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] workers were across the street, and I saw this happen.  And, they said, "Well, we're gonna take them some soft drinks."  And, they got paper cups and a box, and they must have had eight or ten cups in.  And, I still remember the bravery of these kids.  Because, they said, "Well, remember, protect yourself if, you know, if you get knocked down, cover up," and they bravely went.  And, I had--I told the FBI, "I want you to get pictures of this."  And, they had deputized all the hoods in town and they had guns and batons.  And, the cameras followed them and we thought they were getting the whole thing.  When we got back to Washington [D.C.] and we looked at the film, the film followed these kids across the street.  And then it showed them approaching these deputies, and you see a hand raise and then the camera goes off into the building and misses the whole thing.  And, again, that was my--that was the FBI in those days.  And, I will say this, I've actually written about this.  And, so, this was a learning lesson for me in democracy, and how institutions that you wanna respect were operating in those days.  So, it was a lesson.  I'll never forget these experiences.  I grew up in many ways through those years.
Story_ID: 191571
Speaker 1: How long were you with the Civil Rights Div--?
Speaker 2: Not long enough.  I was with them about two years.  I had planned to stay longer, and as I--and I'll tell you that story which is another one of those stories that have changed my life.  In Birmingham [Alabama], where [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] spent most of his time in those days, there's only one place for you to stay if you were black.  And, that was the A.G. Gaston Motel [Birmingham, Alabama], which was owned by Rich Insurance [ph.] and A.G. Gaston.  So, we both stayed at that hotel.  One night, I was out in the field working on a voting rights case, and as it was starting to get dark, I came back to the hotel--motel.  And, as I was pulling in, Dr. King was pulling out, or Reverend Smith was driving him.  And, they were going to Selma [Alabama] that night.  As I said, King was organizing Selma for the great march that we now know about.  But, you know, that didn't happen overnight.  Many people don't understand it, you don't just go in and say, let's go marching.  You had to prepare people.  And, he was in that process.  So, we stopped and I rolled down the window and we talked a bit.  And, then he said, "Oh, you know, Reverend Smith has--one of his tires isn't that good.  Do you mind if we used your car?"  And, I said, "Not at all."  'Cause, I thought, you know, I think the last thing that anyone wanted in those days, was for Dr. King to be stranded on one of those country roads and somebody come upon him, and--so, I let him use my car.  And, King didn't know at that time, and I certainly didn't, that he was being followed both by the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] and by George Wallace's [George Corley Wallace Jr.] [Alabama] state equivalent of the FBI.  And, so, they were out on the street.  There was a wall as you go in here, so, when we went back to exchange cars, they couldn't see, but my car came out and they followed them to Selma.  And, the next day, all the news reported that [HM The Honorable] Thelton [E.] Henderson had driving Dr. King to Selma.  And, that was a big event back then because, you know, it was the--before the [President Richard Milhous] Nixon southern strategy was getting.  And, [President John F.] Kennedy very much didn't wanna alienate the South.  He wanted to do what he could for civil rights, but.  And, so, it was very bad politically to be seen as supporting, secretly indeed, the Civil Rights Movement.  And, I jokingly said in a speech recently to some students.  Here I was a year and half out of law school and it was probably the highest point I've ever gotten in life, even as a federal judge.  Because, in the southern papers every time they would write about that, which was daily then, they would described me as a high ranking government official, or an intimate of President John F. Kennedy.  You know, I mean, that's the way they were putting the political spin on it.  And, it became a very real political risk for him.  And, it grew to the point that the southern senators--Selma is in Dallas County [Alabama].  The Dallas county grand jury was scheduled to hold hearings on this car loan.  And, in Washington [D.C.] they were coming, they were gonna stage this politically.  And, it was going to happen in December of '63 [1963].  And, I'm short, I'm truncating the story, and the only reason they didn't have it was that President Kennedy was assassinated in November [1963].  And, of course that, the political motivation was gone, and they cancelled those hearings.  But, anyway, you--this started out with you're asking how long did I work.  Well, I was eased out the door at this point for the car loan, and I resigned and came back to California--
Story_ID: 191572
Speaker 1: You were born in, well, you're raised in [Los Angeles] California, you go to Boalt Hall [University of California, Berkeley School of Law, Berkeley, California], and then you go to Washington [D.C.], and then you're--go back to Louisiana where you were born.  Did anything in your young life, or your education prepare you for what, the events and what you found in the South?
Speaker 2: Not at all.  Not at all.  I was--I realized that a lot of the things I knew about--I knew there was discrimination and my family was all from the South.  They would tell individual stories of discrimination.  But, it was--I realized when I finally was there, it was an abstraction really.  And, not until I actually saw in day-to-day operation, and some of the cruelty of it and the firmness with which it was enforced, did I really understand it.  So, it was, it was quite a shock.  I think it would be a fair word to say that I was shocked by what I actually saw and experienced.
Speaker 1: Did your experiences, did they change your view on the law?  You had, you not, you've studied political science and you went to law school, and then you get here and you see all this injustice and how laws are being used, you know, to hurt other people.  Did it change any of your views about being a lawyer, or the law, or what you wanted to do?
Speaker 2: Now, I think, that's when I--my career path was set.  I think that I believe that I could do something about it.  We were just starting to get law suit and Thurgood [Marshall] was starting to win kinds of cases and things like that were happening.  And, I was firmly convinced that that's--that was the way to go.  That that was the role I could play.  I realized very quickly that I was not one to lead a march.  I just am not an out front guy:  "Let's go gang, let's go get them."  I was more someone who could give advice and in a smoke filled room, and strategize and do those kinds of things.  And, I thought I could do that as a lawyer.  So, I was more than ever convinced to be a lawyer and really do a good job at it.  And, learn how to use those tools for the [Civil Rights] Movement.
Story_ID: 191573
Speaker 1: You mentioned that you exchanged cars with [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.], and you had some other experiences.  What was Dr. King like?  What was--what did knowing him mean to you?
Speaker 2: Oh, it meant everything.  I mean, it was inspiring.  He was an absolutely amazing man.  I'm convinced from little casual conversations that I would have with him, or that I was involved in with a group that he was prepared to give his live for the movement.  He often, you know, there's that speech you see on TV says, "When I get to the mountain top."  And, people interpret that as saying, he knows he gonna die.  And, I saw it even earlier then in '63 [1963].  I would see that, that he--that was his mission in life, that he wasn't gonna back down.  I think, he had that sense of purpose.  It was, it was inspiring, and he was amazing.  At his private self, he was fairly casual, that always impressed me.  He wasn't pretentious as you might expect it.  A man who was in the papers every day and on the front all of 'em.  He was casual and he'd sit around in his socks and sometimes in an undershirt and talk.  And, then one day, I remember we were at the A.G. Gaston Motel [Birmingham, Alabama], on this very hot day.  And, the press was following him every place; The New York Times, The World Press, and, he had a speech he was going, an address he was gonna give.  And, he was in his room and he was dead tired.  And, I remember just--look like he wasn't even gonna make it.  And, then Andy Young came in and said, "Okay, Dr., it's time to go get it."  He put on his shirt and just became a (unclear), I'll never forget that.  Got out there with that voice, and it was Dr. King.  And, that transformation when he went public was just--I'll never forget that.  How he just transformed himself, and gave the speech, and answered questions, and then went back in the room, and was tired again.  So, anyway, he was an inspiring, for a great man.  I think, certainly probably the greatest man I have had the pleasure of meeting and getting to know to the extent that I did. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Wonderful.  Thank you.  Were you in Washington [D.C.] during the March [on Washington]?
Speaker 2: I was not in Washington--
Speaker 1: You were not.
Speaker 2: During the march.  And, interestingly enough, I'd--by then I'd gotten to know many of the players in the Civil Rights Movement.  And, they were coming into town, and the [U.S. Justice] Department purposely sent me (laughter) on a trip.  I think so that I wouldn't be there for the march.  I think that they again, it was a fraternization and all that they wanted to minimize.  And, so, I wasn't in town for the march, interestingly enough.
Story_ID: 191574
Speaker 1: Is there anything else you wanna tell us about that time in your life?
Speaker 2: It was a formative time for me, as I said.  I think, much of the inspiration, the determination I've gotten came with that, during that time of my life.  I think it was the one formative job that I had that I think shaped me for the rest of my life.  There are many, many stories I could tell.  You were asking, there was some story I was thinking maybe I'll get to the point of it and--
Speaker 1: The bombing in the church?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The bombing of the church, and there was a point I'll make as I tell it.  I was back in Washington [D.C.] and I went to visit some friends on a hot Sunday day and the door with those screens as they have them in Arlington [Virginia] there.  And, the radio was on and I thought to ring the doorbell and I heard it.  They were saying, "The church had been bombed in Birmingham [Alabama]."  And, I knew that I would get involved in that.  And, I rang the doorbell and my friends came to the door, and I said, "I better go home and, 'cause I'm gonna have to go to Birmingham."  And, by the time I got home, there was a military vehicle there with two military police at my apartment.  And, I got a suit and suitcase and I packed up, flew me to the military base.  I got on a jet and flew to, to Birmingham.  And, the first thing they did was take me to the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] Headquarters where they were meeting.  And, one of the things they wanted me to do was to get the government, Brook Marshall [ph.], who was the head of the Civil Rights Division in touch with Dr. King.  'Cause things were very touchy there, and people were shooting and all.  And, actually the point I wanted to make here was about the sense of danger--
Story_ID: 191575
Speaker 1: They asked me to drive to this place and where one of the black leaders lived.  And, I knew [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was there.  And, I remember getting in a car and it was getting dark.  And, the reports were that people were shooting at each other.  And, whites were shooting at blacks.  And, some blacks were shooting back.  And, I remember, when I left I was in the white neighborhood.  And, I remember having the lights out and thinking, Oh, boy, this is dangerous being, driving a car in this white neighborhood.  And, then when I got to the black part of town, turning the lights on, so they could see that I was black.  But, the story I've always told and it's true, was that, it was dangerous but I couldn't image dying.  I mean, it was--I was actively thinking, what's gonna happen?  And, I remember thinking, if they shoot, you know, I could image getting nicked I the arm.  I couldn't image dying.  I sort of had this mission that I wasn't gonna die.  And, I've never forgotten, it was the strangest feeling.  It was almost transcending, that I was out of body.  That some non-corporeal person was driving this car and they might get shot, but I wasn't.  It was the strangest thing, and I think--and, I've talked to others out there, and I think, some others who were facing danger sort of felt that way.  That it wasn't, it wasn't gonna happened.  Or, if it did, okay.  But, that was--I'll never forget that drive.  It was the longest drive I have ever taken.  It seem to hours to get there because, you're, you're waiting for a bullet to be fired at you.  But it was, the whole thing was, I'm repeating myself now, but, it was just an amazing time in my life.
Story_ID: 191576
Speaker 1: When you left the Civil Rights department [sic, Civil Rights Division, U.S. Justice Department, Washington, D.C.], how did you feel?
Speaker 2: I felt bad.  I felt like a failure, 'cause this was my first job out of law school.  And, I essentially get fired, you know.  I resigned, but I essentially get fired.  I felt like I was a failure at that point in my life.  I've said when I've talked about it, I came back to California sort of with my tail between my legs and to try to pick up the pieces.  I could not have possibly imagined in 1964 that I'd someday be a federal judge.  I just, was a farther, you know, I felt I would be lucky if I picked up the pieces and had a decent law practice.  So, that, that's the way I felt most immediately.  And, you know, eventually got my confidence back and started doing things and, but the immediate feeling was one of failure, that I had blown it.  And, my first job out of law school.  And, my first real job.
Speaker 1: But, now when you look back at it, do you feel that you've succeeded?
Speaker 2: I do.
Speaker 1: That you did some good things (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I feel that I succeeded.  I am so glad that it all happened to me.  Even that, I'm glad it happened.  I'm glad that I did what I did.  I think, I would feel bad if I hadn't done what I did, to loan that car to [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.].  I think I would've had questions about myself, had I not done it.  So, and, I feel fortunate too.  As I say, most of these things just happened.  I didn't plan them.  And, so, I look back on how did I respond to things that happened to me and I, I give myself a passing grade, now, in 2004.  But, back then, it was so much more immediate.  And, I didn't know what the future held.
Story_ID: 191577
Speaker 1: So, when you left Washington [D.C.], what did you do?
Speaker 2: I actually stayed in Washington a short time because I thought I had a story to tell.  I had been on, you know, I had been--went and investigated the [Birmingham, Alabama] bombing.  I knew [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.].  I was a participant, or immediately there on the most significate things that were happening.  I knew Medgar Evers.  I'd been with him the night before he was assassinated.  I thought I had a story to tell.  And, I wanted to write what would've been a contemporary book about all of the things that I had seen and participated.  So, I stayed in Washington, got up faithfully, went to the library every day.  One of the problems was when I had to resign, they had us keep a book.  We kept a book on everything we did.  I had a little book and I would say, "Visited with Dr. King, we talked about this and that.  Went out, interviewed John Smith, Route 1, Box 2, about voting."  I had everything.  When I resigned, I had to turn in that book and it's never turned up again.  Even under the Freedom of Information Act.  So, that when I started writing about it; one, I'm not an author, still not after--and it came very slowly.  It came very hard.  I was writing it by myself.  If I were to do it over again, I'd probably get someone to help me, or maybe even, "as told by."  So, I worked on that for a number of months and it was coming along.  But, keep in mind I had no job at this point.  I ran out of money, and I had a decision to make.  And, I decided I needed to come back.  So, I--I still have it in a box somewhere.  And, now, I plan to resurrect it, and it will be ancient history now.  But, I will write about that.  And, I hope to publish it someday.  But, I came back to California and started practicing law.
Story_ID: 191578
Speaker 1: You mentioned you knew Medgar [Wiley] Evers.  Can you tell us something about that experience, what he was like?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Medgar Evers, I met Medgar in Jackson [Mississippi] of course.  And, he was the head of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] there, and a real fire brand.  He was organizing the city in a way it had never been organized before.  And, he really, I think, got the city and the nation's attention when he organized a boycott of a [F. W.] Woolworth [Company] store.  And, that was on the news and it was getting him a lot of attention, getting him a lot of enemies locally.  And, so much so, that if you recall those times, Roy Wilkins, who was the head of the NAACP was catching a lot of flak because [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] is the S--Southern Christian Leadership Conference [SCLC] was on the front line.  SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee], the student nonviolent, they were on the front line.  And, there was another Civil Rights group.  I'm having a senior moment, that I'm not thinking--
Speaker 1: CORE [Congress of Racial Equality].  It's CORE.  CORE.
Speaker 2: CORE--
Speaker 1: CORE.
Speaker 2: CORE.  CORE.  And, they were on the front line.  And, the NAACP was seen as, you know, sitting on a soft couch and not being involved.  And, so, on this particular day, Roy Wilkins flew to Jackson to participate in this boycott that was organized by Medgar.  Another one of those strange days for me.  I was assigned to cover that.  And, for some reason, I got there a little late and I couldn't park right at the scene on that main street.  I parked around the corner.  And, as I got out, black kids were handing out leaflets and I got some, which I collected.  And, I was rushing there to get to the front of the store and see this when the police arrested me (laughter), 'cause they saw me with the leaflets.  And, I don't know, and I was also heading for the thing and then most of the blacks; they were a little shy.  And, I was striding purposefully for this thing, and I looked out of place.  So, I got arrested, never got (laughter) to the actual scene where they were, you know, they were gonna go through a ritualistic arrest of Roy Wilkins.  And, I wanted to observe that and see if there was any violence, you know.  So, I never got there and was taken to a truck they had over on the side street, and booked, and taken out of play.  But, anyway, to get on with Medgar Evers, I got to know him during that time, and I'll tell you how inspiring he was.  There was an auditorium, they had a big fundraiser.  And, Lena Horne came, [HM] Harry Belafonte came, and some other people, I don't remember; James Baldwin.  And, I was there again, as an observer, and Lena Horne spoke and other's spoke, and Medgar spoke and told how important all this was.  And, then said now, you know, "Come on up and, had I had--turn in your money, give us your checks."  And, people started doing it.  And, I got so carried away, here I'm with the government [U.S. Justice Department], and I--I actually had gotten in line (laughter).  And, I just said, "I'm gonna do it."  And, then I came to my senses fortunately, and I didn't.  But, that's how inspire--I--he got me involved and I wanted to go up there and say, "I'm with you, brother."  But, I didn't. But, anyway, the night before he was assassinated, we went to a club.  It was a, Jackson was dry, as I recall, 'cause you went to a bottle club, that black bottle club.  And, we sat there and drank and talked until quite late.  And, I left, and went back to hotel.  By the way, again, I have to say, again, that in those days, there were no places I could stay.  I could stay at the A.G. Gaston in Birmingham [Alabama].  There was no place like that in Jackson.  And, I actually, stayed at a [U.S.] military base outside, I forget, an [U.S.] Air Force base.  I believe it was Craig Air Force [Base, Alabama].  That's the only place I could stay.  And, went there and then the next day, flew back to Washington [D.C.] and that night, the next night, he was assassinated.  So, he was a great man, great man.
Story_ID: 191579
Speaker 1: There's another story, and tell me if these war stories are getting boring but, there's another story related to an [U.S.] Air Force base.  James Baldwin was in Selma [Alabama], and I had met him in Birmingham when he was at the A.G. Gaston [Motel, Birmingham, Alabama].  And then things, the action moved to Selma and he was there.  And, I was in the [U.S.] Post Office building where the federal presence was.  And, I heard on the radio there, and I was the only one in there then, a two way radio conversation in which they were talking about Baldwin.  And, I heard them say, "Yeah, we're gonna get that black nigger.  He thinks he's," you know, "down here to tell us what to do."  So, and, I don't know who it was, but I went out and I told him.  I said, "Hey, I just heard this, and I think you better be careful."  And, he says (makes noise).  And, he says, "I better get out of here."  The story is, I tell you it's absolutely true, but (laughter).  So, he had driven there with a SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] worker who had this red convertible and, you know, I said, "No.  I don't think you ought to be going in a red convertible."  We talked, and we talked, and then finally, I said, "Well, look," it was getting late, "I'm going back to Birmingham, ride with me."  And, so, we went and got in my car, and his brother, David [Baldwin], got in and this SNCC worker.  And, I--he left his car there, as I recall.  We got in the car and I was telling them all the things I had learned.  "If--be careful, it's getting dark.  If you see a car that seems to be following us, let me know.  And, if a car comes up and it looks like it's gonna pass, watch out."  Because sometimes they do the drive by.  And, I was doing all of this and he was just scared, you know, thinking.  And, then I was staying at the Air Force base [Craig Air Force Base], and that's what started this story.  So, I hadn't checked out.  So, I went to the air force base, went in, checked out, paid my--it's great I stayed in the officer's quarter.  It cost one dollar a night to stay there.  And, I don't know, I think my per diem then was twenty-five dollars.  I came back to Washington always with a lot of money.  It was a good deal.  So, anyway, checked out of the air force base, got in the car, and drove to Birmingham.  And, then he thanked me.  And, two stories that grow from that.  One, a while later he came to, this is after I lost my job and I was in Washington [D.C.], right.  He came to Washington.  He was a big attraction then.  He was at the height of his fame and I went to this thing that was full of people and he said, "I want to introduce my friend, [HM] Thelton [E.] Henderson who saved my life," you know, and told the story.  And, said, you know, and he told the story much like I told it, and then said, "But, you know, when I started feeling safe?"  Talking to the audience, and answered his own quest--he said, "When he stopped at the military base and got a gun" (laughter).  And, over all the years, I'd never had the nerve to tell him, I didn't get a gun (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: He thought, I had gone and got a gun and I was ready to (laughter).  And, I never told him that I just got my suitcase (laughter).  But, the other story that derives from that, he always said as we were driving and we got where we knew we safe, we weren't being followed, he said, he was gonna write about this incident and he had a title for it.  It was gonna be called 'Flight to Birmingham.'  And, the title was the irony, he said, "Last week I was in Birmingham [Alabama] and I thought that was the most dangerous place I'd ever been.  And, now I'm fleeing to Birmingham."  And, then he was gonna write about that, and he never did.  I always looked forward to seeing him write about that incident.

Speaker 1: You have--you resigned.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And, you, you're writing, you're in Washington [D.C.] and you're writing this book, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: And, you're running out of money.
Speaker 2: I'm running out of money.
Speaker 1: So, what happened then (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Okay.  I come back to California, and interesting, I, very interesting career, I--remember I told you there was one black in the class ahead of me.  Don[ald] Warden had started practicing in the black neighborhood in Oakland [California].  And, he had a thriving practice.  He was a brilliant guy, and had a neighborhood practice.  And, I was still thinking of writing that book.  And, so, I started off just running errands for him, you know.  He had more, he'd say, "Why don't you go done and get a continuance for me?"  And, I would do that.  And, he'd give me, whatever, a hundred dollars, for when I do these things.  And, that was plenty.  I was actually, at that point in my life, I was staying back in a rooming house I had lived at as an undergrad [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California].  My expenses were none existed, and this was fine.  I did this for a while and then I finally realize the book isn't coming, I gotta get on with my life.  So, I actually started practicing with Don.  We set up a partnership with another fella and called it, Don was very modest, called it, Henderson, my name first, Holloman, and Warden.  And, it was a thriving practice in the sense that we made good money.  But, I came to realize that it wasn't the kind of practice that I wanted.  That I would never really become a lawyer.  You know, you'd get an auto accident and you would do a little discovery and you would settle it.  Or, someone would come in on Friday and say, "I gotta be in court on a criminal thing on Monday."  And, in those days in California you had a little booklet that told you what the proper fee should be.  And, you know, I'd sort of open the little book, and say, "Okay, drunk driving," or, "Assault with a deadly weapon," that will be $750 dollars or whatever it was.  And, the general answer is "Well, let's see.  I've got $623 dollars."  "I'll take it," you know, and that's the way the practice went.  And, I--that wasn't what I had in mind for myself.  So, after about a year of that, I decided I really wanted to be, what I thought was a real lawyer.  I left that and began practicing with a state assemblyman.  A wonderful man named Nicholas [C.] Petris--
Story_ID: 191581
Speaker 1: --When we left the last time, you were talking about you were in a practice and you didn't like, you found that you weren't happy with that kind of law and you wanted to change.  So, could you tell us--you left the law firm and?
Speaker 2: I left the law firm that I had set up with Don[ald Warden] and Bill Holloman [ph.].  And, I went over to Oakland and began a practice with a state assemblyman, Nick, Nick Petris [Nicholas C. Petris], who was a very respected legislator.  At a firm of FitzSimmons and Petris.  And, began practicing there.  It was a mixed practice.  Nick was Greek and had all the Greek business.  So, I actually (laughter) became a specialist on Greek probate.  Because it seems that everyone in the area who died, left something to the church in Greece that they went--and I became very good at probating those and writing up the wills and all.  But, I also, I did the criminal work for some reason with the firm.  I did the civil--It was a general practice.  And, I did that for a couple of years, and enjoyed it very much.  It was a good practice, good people.  But, I had met someone, whose name I can't now recall, he was a, he was a reporter for the New York Times, and we had become friends down South.  He covered the [Civil Rights] Movement down South.  And, one day I got a call from him.  And, he was now a, I forget his position, but he's with the Peace Corps.  And, he was recruiting for the Peace Corps and he called and said, "Hey, you ever thought about joining the Peace Corps.?"  And, I said, "Hm."  And, he started talking about it and you know, "Yeah, I'm sure you could probably head up one of the countries.  What you like?"  And, I said, "Well, Africa."  The more I thought about it, the greater it sounded.  So, I ended up applying, and actually, getting offered a job to head the Peace Corps in the Cameroons.  And, I made my announcement to the firm and began waiting for the processing.  And, I waited, and I waited, and it's a theme in my life, I started running out of money, 'cause I didn't have any money.  I shut down my practice.  And, I started inquiring, and he didn't know.  "Well, I don't know, something's"--turned out to make a long story short, that somebody had come upon the lending of the car [to Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  And, the fact that I had left under questionable circumstances, and this was holding it up.  And, so, finally, I waited a little longer and I said, "Hey, I can't wait."  So, I resigned before I had the job.  I said, "I can't wait for you to clear that up."  And, by then, I was headed in other directions. I didn't go back with the firm.  I went to East Palo Alto [California], which is a predominantly black community, as you know.  And, opened up the first legal aid office in East Palo Alto.  And, so, I did that, we're at 1966 now.  I opened up the East Bayshore Neighborhood Legal Center in East Palo Alto, and I ran that.  I had a lot of Stanford [University, Stanford, California] students working for me.  And, I did that and I enjoyed it very much, and they very much needed--the state of the law back then was awful.  The most typical client was someone who would come in and say, you know, "I went to pick up my paycheck and half of it was gone."  'Cause in those days before you got the protections you do now, a creditor would say, you know, "You owe me money," and they could get a garnishing on your check before they even won anything.  And, it was, it was awful.  So, we did a lot of that.  We did domestic relations.  We did divorces.  And, did bankruptcies, and all the things you do in a poor community of people who are eligible for legal aid.  And, I liked it very much.
Story_ID: 191582
Speaker 1: One day, one of the Stanford students working for me, said words to the effect that, "Gee, you know Sallyanne Payton is graduating from the [Stanford] Law School."  This was '68 [1968] now, and she'll be the first black in the history of the law school.  And, I was flabbergasted that even though Boalt [Hall, University of California Berkeley School of Law, Berkeley, California] didn't have that sterling a record, I couldn't believe that Stanford had never graduated a black in its history.  Sallyanne Payton, by the way, is a professor at Michigan's law school [University of Michigan Law School, Ann Arbor, Michigan] now.  She went on to do quite well.  So, the school [Stanford Law School, Stanford, California] approached me about this time.  They wanted to do something, and they ended up offering me a job to set up a minority program for them, on a half-time basis.  So, I went half-time at legal aid, and half-time at Stanford, and very quickly realized there's no such thing as two half-time jobs.  I was working full-time on both and, you know, sinking slowly into the sea.  So, I had been at legal aid three years by now.  And, I had a very able young assistant that I thought was ready to take over.  And, so, I went over to Stanford on a full-time basis as assistant dean, and set up a minority program there.  And, I had planned to stay a couple of years, and the dean was--met all my demands.  Gave me the money I thought I needed to fly around recruit people, fly people in, gave me the authority to admit people at a certain standard that we agreed upon.  And, the program started going so well, ultimately by the time I left, eight years later, twenty-two percent of the entering class was minority.  So, it was a very successful program.  But, I didn't leave in two or three years because I'd starting understanding the institution.  And, I was convinced that if I left the commitment was to me, that the program would wither away and go back to what it was.  And, I wanted to stay long enough to institutionalize the program.  So, I actually stayed there 'til 1976.  And, as I said, by that time twenty-two percent of the entering class was minority.  And, I also taught.  I taught clinical courses.  I taught a civil procedure class.  I caught--taught a trial advocacy class.  And, that was my undoing.  Although I loved this job.  I was very happy.  Teaching trial advocacy I convinced myself that, boy, I'll bet I'm a helluva lawyer now; that I've been teaching it and having an academic view, thinking about it.  And, certain things I'd say, "Gee, I wish I'd known that when I had that case."  And, I thought, I just had an itch to practice again, even though I loved this job.
Story_ID: 191583
Speaker 1: I left Stanford [Law School, Stanford, California] in '76 [1976], and went to--and then setup a practice with two friends; Joe Remcho, who was an ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union] lawyer at the time and; and Sandy Rosen [Sanford Jay Rosen], who was the chief counsel of the Mexican-American Legal Defense Fund [MALDEF].  And, we decided we were gonna setup what we call, "a good guy law firm."  We were gonna do public interest work, but in a private firm setting.  And, he was--they were working for nonprofits and we were just gonna do it as private lawyers.  I was gonna do the employment discrimination and that kind of thing, and I had had a criminal background, I was gonna do criminal law.  And, they were gonna do public interests, civil rights.  And, so we started doing that.  And, were more successful early on that we had any right to do, because Sandy had connections with the National Council of Churches through his (unclear).  So, right away, everyone tells you when you setup a law firm like the one we did, you're gonna lose money for a couple of years.  We never lost money.  We started getting a draw, which is good, 'cause I didn't have any money to lose (laughter).  I mean, everything I had was in the firm and I bought the house I now live in.  But, the National Council of Churches hired our firm to do the Wounded Knee litigation [United States v. Banks and Means (Wounded Knee)], and the Kent State [University, Kent, Ohio] appeal [Krause v. Rhodes].  So, we were lucky, since the National Council of Churches [NCC] paid us.  We were just like a real firm, you know, you put in your hours, you give it, and they'd send us a check.  So, we started meeting our bills immediately without losing that money.  So, it was wonderful.  And, we had a very good practice.  And, Sandy and Joe are two of the best lawyers I've ever met.  Joe, who passed away in a helicopter crash last year.  But, when he passed away, he was a, he was a legal advisor for [Governor Joseph] "Gray" Davis.  He was for many years, [California Assembly Speaker] Willie [L.] Brown's advisor, when Willie was head of the, a speaker of the house.  Joe was probably the top political lawyer, if not in the country.  And, then so, that was the kind of partners we--I had.  So, we were, we were good.  They were good, and I was riding along in a good thing.  We had a good firm.
Story_ID: 191584
Speaker 1: One day, I'm sitting at my desk and I open a piece of mail and it's on green paper.  I can still see it.  A form paper that said, "Dear counselor," counselor was crossed out and "Thelton" was written in.  And, the gist of the letter was that your name has come to our attention as the kind of person, Senator Alan [MacGregor] Cranston is thinking of appointing to the federal bench.  And, if you're interested, here's an application."  And, I swear to you as I sit here, that I had never thought about being a federal judge up until, even after that moment.  And, I thought, and I went to Sandy [Rosen] and Joe [Remcho], who were much more savvy politically than I.  And, I said, "What's this all--what do you think?"  And, they said, "Well, the word on the street is that Cranston is going to appoint a woman, and it turned out to be Marilyn [Hall] Patel, who is now our chief.  And, he's going to appoint a Hispanic, and that turned out to be Bob Aguilar, who was on our court for many years.  And, a black, turned out to be me, as it turn--and, so, and we had primarily a federal practice.  And, their thinking was that not many black, even today, twenty-three years later, I rarely see a black attorney in my court.  Blacks don't seem to practice in federal court a lot.  I see a few, John Burris comes in and people.  But, and, back then it was even fewer.  And, so, they said, "You practice in federal court.  You probably have a leg up on this."  So, I'm getting a federal appointment.  So, based on that wisdom, I turned in the application and through some miracle, I will never understand, I got the judgeship, and here I am.
Speaker 2: Here you are (unclear).  Boy, heavens.  I just--well, you have--your life is just so--I don't know what to say about your life, it's just wonderful.
Story_ID: 191585
Speaker 1: Can I go back, just a couple things you had mentioned?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Wounded Knee?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Could you tell us a little bit about that case [United States v. Banks and Means (Wounded Knee)]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: For those of--
Speaker 2: Okay.  This--
Speaker 1: Some people--
Speaker 2: Was a case of Indians were protesting in, it's been many years now, North--
Speaker 1: North Dakota.
Speaker 2: North Dakota.  And, they were arrested and charged with all kinds of things.  And, this was the appeal of those arrests.  And, many of them were incarcerated and they had had the trials.  And, then as a follow-up to that that I will tell you about in just a moment.  So, that was a very important case, and Sandy [Rosen] did the appellate--he's a, he's a superb appellate attorney.  So, we did the appellate arguments there and he did a wonderful job.  We won that appeal.  A follow-up to Wounded Knee was one of the defendants in that case was a, one of the leaders, Leonard Crow Dog.  Leonard Crow Dog, there is a, there's an Indian college up Highway 5 [California], I see it when I go fishing up there.  Its CDQ [ph.] is the name of the college and I forget what those initials stand for.  They had a conference and Leonard Crow Dog came out for that conference.  One of the terms; he was on probation.  One of the terms of his probation was no drinking, and he was arrested for drunk driving.  And, it was critical 'cause they were, you know, threw him back in jail for a long time.  And, I was the only one in the firm that did criminal stuff.  So, I took the case.  And, it was in Fairfield, California, and it was one of the strangest days of my life.  I went up to Fairfield, met Leonard at the court, and then was going to meet him--met him in my office, we briefed and I was gonna go up for the arraignment.  And, went up there and he had, you know, (unclear) the Indian hand, the feather down to the--and the Indian dress, and I'm of course black.  And, we talk into this courtroom.  They had never seen, I don't think they'd ever seen a black (laughter) in there.  And, they certainly had never seen a genuine Indian.  Mouths just fell open as we walked around.  And, I've told this story many times.  We, the way they did it there is informal.  We went into the judge's chambers to talk about the case and see if there is any possible disposition.  Leonard stayed outside.  I went in.  And, it's one of these small town courts that you hate, if you're an outsider.  Because first thing the DA [District Attorney] goes in and the judge says, "Boy, if you don't improve your golf game, you know, boy, I thought you would," you know, and they talk about that a while and I'm sitting there.  And, then he finally picks up the file, and you can imagine how I felt.  He looks at it and says, "Hm. Looks like injun chief drink too much firewater."  And, I said, "Oh, God, we're dead meat."  But, anyway, after a lot of work and continuances and research and memos, we got the charge reduced so that it didn't threaten his probation.  But, anyway, that was, that started with the Wounded Knee.  Then we got that case as an offshoot of our Wounded Knee representation.
Story_ID: 191586
Speaker 1: Kent State [shootings at Kent State University, Kent, Ohio].  As you know, was a case of where the [U.S.] National Guard was on duty there and ended up shooting several, I think it was several, boy, my memory is bad now, of the Kent State students who were protesting.  And, it was another--there's still a picture of that that you may have--of this young woman with her arms raised.  It was just in everybody's mind and in every, every paper.  And, we had the, the appeal of the conviction of some of the students who were arrested there and to clear up those convictions.  And, again, we had great success on that.  Got that reversed.  We, I say, Sandy [Rosen] did it, primarily, he's very good.  And, again, a very satisfying work.  And, the good thing about both of these in addition to be involved in something of national consequence, as I said, it paid the bills.  And, allowed us to do the kinds of things that we wanted to do.  One of the things we had said when we set up the law firm-- we had a goal.  We said, "We don't want to make as much money as our classmates," who started practicing in big firms.  We're not trying to get rich.  But, we do wanna, I wanna make more than I made as assistant dean at Stanford [Law School, Stanford, California].  Joe [Remcho] wanted to make more than he made at the ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union].  So, we wanted to make more money, but, we didn't want money to be the driving force.  And, that turned out to be very important because the kinds of work we did, doesn't make you rich.  So, it allowed us, though, because we weren't after money, which was to do the kind of Civil Rights things that we wanted.  And, it turned out to be a very important decisions because we had some fairly important small victories right early.  And, one, was a discrimination case we won against one of the big meat packing unions.  And, we did such a thorough job that they wanted to hire us.  And, it's lucky that we had make that decision because we would have made a lot of money.  But, had a regular client with a lot of business, but it wouldn't've been what we set out to do.  And, having said, "Here's what we wanna do and it isn't about money," we were able to turn down that business, you know.  And, I think it made all the difference in the world of how we felt about ourselves and what we thought we stood for.
Story_ID: 191587
Speaker 1: So, did your friend asked if you wanted to apply to be federal judge?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, you filled out the application.
Speaker 2: I filled out the application and again, I can't help but say, you know, I feel, again, I have to just say, 'Forrest Gump' where some hand is guiding me, and leading me, and protecting me.  Because, I turned in the application and that's all I did.  And, I now know, I'd say once a week some young lawyer, I bump into 'em or he ask if he can come up and he say, "You know, I wanna be a federal judge and I've done of these things.  I've talked to this person, I joined these groups."  They know what to do.  I was clueless.  I turned in my application.  I did nothing.  I didn't talk to anybody.  The only people that knew I turned it in were my partners.  And, I sat back and I waited, and (laughter) I'm so lucky.  And, one day, I don't know, about a month later, I got a call from someone and said, "They're interviewing some of the applicants over at the [California] State Bar [Examination], and your interview is at eleven o'clock next Tuesday," or something.  So, I go and again, I did nothing.  I went to the interview, and I almost blew it because [Senator Alan MacGregor] Cranston had a statewide committee.  Most of them were Democrats in the room, he had sprinkled it with some conservatives and some Republicans.  And, again, one of these guys took me on.  He said, "Well, I, I look at your application here, Mr. [HM Thelton E.] Henderson, and I see you're with the Civil Rights Division, your firm now, you do Civil Rights, you did this and you did that.  If you become a federal judge, you're gonna be handling a lot of business cases, and anti-trust, and securities, how can I be sure that you're gonna be fair to these people, with your take on life?"  That was essentially his questions.  And, I just--I don't get mad often.  But, I just--steam must have been coming out of my ears, 'cause I was practicing in federal court.  And, most of the judges in our court at that time were white males who had been business lawyers with big firms.  And, I just said, and I was just starting to realize, I said, "I can be as fair to them as the business lawyers can be to me."  And, I was starting--and one of the guys on the committee that I know, and I'm beholden to, cut in, and cut me off before I just totally blew it.  And, but anyway, I left there and said, "Well, I blew it."  You know, I had my chance.  And, about a week later, I got a call that I was one of five finalists.  There were three positions, I'm sorry, there was one position at that time, but two more were coming up, and that I was one of five--
Story_ID: 191588
Speaker 1: Me, Marilyn [Hall] Patel, the woman that I told you who got it, and Bob Aguilar and then two white males were on this short list.  And, [Senator Alan MacGregor] Cranston being the savvy politician he was, there was one opening.  He immediately appointed Bob Aguilar, so that the five of us wouldn't start lobbying him, you know.  He said, this was just--and, so, that left the four of us in limbo because, we didn't know when these other two position were gonna open up.  So, then all kinds of things happened that came back to haunt me, because I had done nothing politically at this point, remember.  And, I was sort of a stealth bomber in that sense.  People didn't even know I'd applied, so.  But, now that this was opened, they knew I was there.  And, a questions arose as to would Cranston open it up again or when these other two position or would he appoint from the four of us?  And, to my horror, he opened it up again.  So, by then, everybody knew I was there, and it's fortunate.  Willie [Lewis] Brown [Jr.] is a good friend but, Willie Brown had another candidate and he entered the fray.  And, started advocating for, who is a good friend of mine, stated advocating for another black to get it.  And, I figure, it's done.  Because now it's political, and I'm not a political person.  But, my wife at the time, I'm divorced, was very savvy, she had been a political aid in Sacramento [California].  She knew the political game.  And, I started saying, you know, "Really," and the people starting to put the word out that, "Well, you know, [HM] Thelton [E. Henderson], you know, he's got two white partners.  He practices on Montgomery. He taught at Stanford [Law School, Stanford, California], he's not really of the black community anyway.  And, they started feeding that to Alan Cranston, and so I started going around, saying, "Okay, I'm gonna"--and went to France.  I went to--well, just to give you an example, I went to Nick Petris [Nicholas Petris], who is a political power.  By then, he was a [California] state senator, and I said, you know, "I need your help, Nick."  And, he said, sort of laughed and said, "Thelton, you know, I've made a commitment a year ago, you're way too late."  I started going to friend, John George [ph.], he was the head of the county board of supervisors, and was a roommate at Cal [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California].  He said, the same thing, "[HM] Thelton [E. Henderson], you know, you're too late, I'm committed."  So, I was thoroughly distressed.  I didn't have any place to go.  My wife, who knows the game said, "Well, look, play your stre--you really are in the broader public interest community.  Go to your strength."  So, I started going to my strength, and the first thing I did I went to a student, someone who had been in one of my classes.  Colleen Gershon was her name.  It was now Colleen Gershon Haas.  She was married to Bob Haas of the Levi [Strauss and Co.].  I went to Colleen, and she wrote a letter and I still remember it.  And, I said, "My fortunes are turning."  She gave me a copy of it.  And, the letter, I still remember it.  It said, "Dear Alan," to Cranston.  "The family really enjoyed our dinner with you the other night, and you can count on us for all the things we talked about.  But, I'm really writing now about someone that we really want to see become a federal judge."  And, I said, "My wife, was right, this is the way to go."  And, then one of my friends at Stanford that I met, was on the faculty that I came, it was Cranston's campaign manager and fundraiser, and I went to him.  So, I went these sources and I think that kept me in the running.  So, when the position came up again, to Cranston's credit, 'cause I had nothing to give politically, he stayed with me, and appointed me.
