Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And the first one is: Do you have a favorite food and what is it?

Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last one is:  Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's kind of hard to answer.  You know, I, not a favorite, I guess I just--my friends would probably say that I say that it's just good to be living.
Story_ID: 304085
Speaker 1: Now I'm going to ask you about your family history.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Robert L. Billingslea] side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We'll start with your mother's side of the family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it?
Speaker 2: Yes, her name is Faye Billingslea.  Well, her maiden name was Stevenson--
Speaker 1: Okay, can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: S-T-E-V-E-N-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: And Faye?
Speaker 2: Faye--
Speaker 1: F-A--
Speaker 2: F-A-Y-E.
Speaker 1: --Y-E?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: F-A-Y-E, I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in 1920, and she was born in, I want to say it's, and I can't spell it but, let's say Woodland, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: They say Talbotton County [sic. Talbot County, Georgia], but I, and I, I tried to spell Talbotton County, but it was in Woodland, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Talbotton County.
Speaker 2: Talbotton County, yes, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what do you know about your mother's ancestors?  I mean, how, you know, the, how far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Not very far.  Well, you know, my, my grandfather [Gabriel Stevenson] of course.  I can, you know, I know my grandfather because he, my grandfather--my grandmother [Ella Mae Stevenson] really kind of raised me, so I'm familiar with them.  And I know when he was born in Georgia, also.  And he was born in 1897 and he was born July 7, 1897.  He was a seventh, the seventh child--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Not, not, not the seventh son of a--
Speaker 2: Seventh son.
Speaker 1: --seventh son, okay.
Speaker 2: --seventh son, yeah.
Speaker 1: What did--did he consider himself lucky?
Speaker 2: You know, I, I don't, I think he would say he was blessed in that he moved from Georgia and went to the industrial north where he found a good paying job, you know, relative to where, where he, he came from.  And, so he found--he, he considered himself a blessed man.  He was a religious man and, so him and my grandmother were both, both born in, in, in Georgia also.  So he moved his family and my aunt up, up to Youngstown, Ohio.  And as the story goes that they were on their way to Detroit [Michigan] to work in the, in, in, in the automotive industry, and he stopped over to see an uncle or cousin and he told him, "Well you know I can get you a job in the steel mill."  That's what he did.  He went with him, got a job in the steel mill.  At that time it was called Youngstown Sheet and Tube [Youngstown Iron Sheet and Tube Company, Youngstown, Ohio].  And he worked in that steel mill for forty years, probably never missed a day, so, you know, hard work and he took care of his family off, off of that, you know.
Speaker 1: Now is there a, is there a story about, you know, why?  I, I mean, I know we can also suppose why somebody would move to the North from Georgia in those days, but is there a story, a direct story, I mean a story, detailed story about why they moved to Youngstown?
Speaker 2: Well yeah, because he wanted a better life.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he figured that if he moved up north where he could get meaningful employment that was the thing to do.
Story_ID: 304086
Speaker 1: Well there was somebody in Youngstown [Ohio] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, yeah there was a--
Speaker 1: --already, right?
Speaker 2: --there was a lot of cousins.  As a matter-of-fact someone gave, got him [Billingslea's maternal grandfather, Gabriel Stevenson] a job and then, I mean, I've always--there was always people moving from the North--I mean, from the South, up to Youngstown.  And they, and we probably housed most of them (laughter) that I know because my grandfather ended up buying a pretty large house, you know, at that time.  And so he had maybe five, four or five bedrooms and he, you know, give 'em a break you know, let them stay there until they got on their feet, did that for many, many people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they were all relatives like, you know.  And some weren't relatives as a matter-of-fact, but they knew somebody, you know.  And I can remember sitting there, and he'd go through a little interview process (laughter), you know.  It was kind of funny, but he would talk to them and give them the rules, you know, if you're going to stay here, here, here's the rules; what you have to do, you know, and that kind of thing.  And he, you know, say, demanded respect; but he got respect by the way that he, he handled himself and so many people, some still living today, who got their start right there living in our, in our home in, in Youngstown, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what year did, did he move up to Youngstown, do you know?
Speaker 2: You know, I, I, I'm not sure.  I can't be sure what year he moved, but I know it was--
Speaker 1: How old was your mother [Faye Stevenson Billingslea] about, you know, when, when your family moved?
Speaker 2: I think my mother--well yeah, that's it, I think my mother was around two years old, if I'm not mistaken.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is about 1922, I guess, then, or so?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: About that, about that time, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Your mother grew up basically in Youngstown then?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother and her sister grew up basically in Youngstown, Ohio.
Story_ID: 304087
Speaker 1: Now before we leave the [maternal] ancestors.  Do they have any stories about conditions in Georgia before they left?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I mean, you know, I mean they, they tell stories.  And he [Billingslea's maternal grandfather, Gabriel Stevenson] could go back and, and--that's something that I've always said I wanted to do, is kind of trace the family, you know, the family tree.  But I remember he, he would talk about his father.  I believe his father was named Dan [ph.].  And, and Dan was the son of a slave, you know.  And he would talk about those, you know, those days, so I guess it wasn't that, it wasn't that great living in Georgia at the time, you know, that he was there.  And so he brought his two kids and, and, and my [maternal] grandmother [Ella Mae Stevenson] who was Ella Mae Huff [ph.], was her name, so it was the Stevensons, or--and the Huffs.  And I just found out.  I just found out about maybe a year ago because I was trying to do a little, a little background on, on, on my grandparents.  And my aunt told me, my Aunt Becky, Rebecca [Stevenson], that at one time that their name was Steverson, S-T-E-V-E-R-S-O-N, and really not Stevenson.  And I said, "Well what happened?"  And it was like, well, when we went to school the, the teachers changed the name.  And they became Stevensons rather than Steversons.  So that kind of muddies the waters, too, you know, because I, I was picking up like a family reunion thing and, and I kept seeing Steverson written, and I'm saying, "Are they misspelling it or, or what?"  So it just came as sort of a shock to me and this was just, you know, just about a year ago when I found this out, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  So you'd have to have traced two names going back to different (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah you really do because I tried to find, I tried to find, you know--went on, it wasn't Goggle, but one of 'em, to trace the family tree and, and about his death and I couldn't find it, I couldn't find it.  It was probably because I, I was looking under Stevenson rather than Steverson.
Story_ID: 304088
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother [Faye Stevenson Billingslea] talk about growing up in Youngstown [Ohio]?  What was it like for her?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, well--yeah, they, they had a, you know, what they considered a, a pretty good life because you know, you know, Youngstown, Ohio was you know, quote, you know, not a segregated, you know, city and, and with respect to, to you know, blacks and whites going to the same school, you know, so and then where we lived there were whites and blacks on the same street, you know, so to them life was good.  I know there was a lot of hidden things which you know, growing up you didn't kind of know until kind of when you looked back on it, you say, you know, there was a lot of racism and discrimination going on, but we didn't, we didn't kind of see it, you know what I mean?  It was there but you didn't kind of see it as, as you would let's say in the South or in Georgia where there was segregation, there were white schools, black schools and things of that nature, colored fountains, restrooms, you didn't have anything like that, so to them that was, that was, that was good living and they made--
Speaker 1: By comparison it was much better.
Speaker 2: By comparison it was much better.
Speaker 1: But was there a black side of Youngstown, I mean an area--
Speaker 2: There were--
Speaker 1: --that, that's predominately black?
Speaker 2: --yes, there were, there were areas, although blacks lived pretty much in any areas, but they were pretty much segregated by, by neighborhoods or streets if you will, you know.  On the side of town that I--that we actually lived, where we--we started out on the east side of town and ended up on the south side of town.  And where we lived there were, like I said, there were like three or four streets where blacks lived.  Now if you went you know, two or three streets down, there were all whites, and then a black neighborhood would start again, you know what I mean?  So, you know, we defined it as coming up the hill.  I lived on what they called the hill, but if you start down and you end downtown, they were coming up from downtown.  There were, you know, black residents there and then there were no blacks and then more blacks and then no blacks, by that time you got to Boardman [Ohio], yeah.  And that's where there were, you know, that was you know, a place where a lot of, a lot of white folks, or richer white folks lived.
Story_ID: 304089
Speaker 1: The guy that builds all the shopping malls, what's his name--now I'm drawing a blank here; used to own, own the San Francisco [49ers]--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I know who you're talking about, the--
Speaker 1: --DeBartolo [Edward J. DeBartolo, Sr. and Edward J. DeBartolo, Jr.].
Speaker 2: DeBartolo, yeah--
Speaker 1: DeBartolo, DeBartolo
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: As a matter-of-fact--
Speaker 2: --the DeBartolo family.
Speaker 1: --one of the families of DeBartolo lived on my street [in Youngstown, Ohio].  And there was--because I remember he lived in a little red brick house and he had one of those cement makers you know, in his backyard.  And the reason I know because I was the paperboy for that whole street.  I had sixty customers, so I knew everybody's name (laughter), trying to collect my money you know, on the street, and he was--and they were one of them.  So like I say, there were white people that lived on that street.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the DeBartolos are rich; owned the San Francisco Giants and I mean  (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, oh yeah
Speaker 2: --yeah, I mean the 49ers, right (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they built malls, see.
Speaker 2: --the San Francisco 49ers and
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --right, and some race tracks, you know --
Speaker 1: Um-hm --
Speaker 2: --and quite a few things.  They
Speaker 1: --very wealthy.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think Bernie Kosar is from Boardman [Ohio]--
Speaker 1: Yeah he was
Speaker 2: --the quarterback of the--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --[Cleveland] Browns or--
Speaker 1: That was Boardman and there were no blacks in Boardman--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --you know, not at that time, you know.  But I was--but Boardman would have been the next big high school [Boardman High School, Boardman, Ohio] from where I went to school, which was South High School [Youngstown, Ohio].  And South--and if I remember correctly, in our graduating class there were maybe sixty blacks out of three hundred or so.
Story_ID: 304090
Speaker 1: Your mother [Faye Stevenson Billingslea], did she grow up on the east side of Youngstown [Ohio] or on the south side?
Speaker 2: She grew up, started out on the east side, yes.  And then when my mother and father [Robert L. Billingslea] were married they moved to the north side.
Speaker 1: Now did she get a chance to go to high school and all that?  Did she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes she did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Went to high school and then they, they moved over on--which was the projects and it was called Westlake Terrace [Youngstown, Ohio].  As a matter of fact, you probably heard Omarosa [Omarosa Manigault] talk about the projects because she's from Youngstown.
Speaker 1: That's where she's from, from Westlake Terrace, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, so that was, I understand that that was the first experiment in, in urban housing, was, was right there in Youngstown in what we called the projects.  So my, my, my mother and father lived in the projects and a lot of my other relatives lived, lived there and, and I kind of went back and forth between my, my parents and my [maternal] grandparents [Ella Mae Stevenson and Gabriel Stevenson].  I was sort of a grandparent kind of baby, you know (laughter), so.  And, and then my mother and my father went into the armed services [U.S. Armed Forces].
Story_ID: 304091
Speaker 1: What is your father's full, full name?
Speaker 2: The same as mine.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're a junior?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah but, yeah, you could say I was a junior, yeah.  It was never--
Speaker 1: It was a slight difference in the middle name or something, or--
Speaker 2: It was, yeah because I kind of adopted his, his middle name, you know what I mean, so he was Robert L. Billingslea and I wanted to be Robert L., but I was Robert Billingslea and so, but it was--I considered myself a junior, you know, until I got older (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right, so what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My father was born in, in October; I want to say October 13th.  I can't remember the year.
Speaker 1: Okay, was he older than your mother [Faye Stevenson Billingslea]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah he was about, he may have been five years older than my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay, so maybe 1915?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I guess. All right.  And, and where was your father born?
Speaker 2: Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Pittsburgh, okay.  Now, what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side?  And how far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Almost nothing, almost nothing.  I know his, his, his--which would have been my [paternal] grandmother--I've never met her.  She had passed on before I was born.  My Aunt Becky [Rebecca Stevenson] was the historian, so she knew her, but that's about it.  And I know that his relatives were from Mississippi, but don't know any of them.
Speaker 1: Okay, so their roots are in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  My--my father was, his roots were from Mississippi.  He was born in Pittsburgh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I knew that his mother was a, she was a seamstress.
Speaker 1: If I'm not mistaken there is a railroad that runs from Mississippi to, to Pittsburgh.  And I, I think the playwright who, who did 'Piano Lesson' ['The Piano Lesson'] made, made the, yeah, August Wilson, the Yellow Dog--August Wilson.
Speaker 2: The Yellow Dog called the Yellow--Yazoo [Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Railroad] and something--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --railroad runs up through there, but that's, that might explain that migration.  But, well tell us about, well, are there any stories from your father's side that were passed down through the family that--
Speaker 1: No, not that I can recall, you know never, never really, you know, I never really got into it, you know, I was more so you know, raised with my, my [maternal] grandparents, so at that early age I never really talked to them about it and my father, my father passed when I was nineteen, so that was somewhat the end of that.
Story_ID: 304092
Speaker 1: Did he [Billingslea's father, Robert L. Billingslea] ever talk about growing up?  Did, did he grow up in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], or did he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, he grew up in Pittsburgh, yeah, well, born in Pittsburgh, but pretty much grew up in Youngstown [Ohio].  Yeah he grew up in Youngstown.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. So is, is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: Not that I can recall, you know, don't really know how they met, I can't--I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so when did they meet?
Speaker 2: Well, I think they met when my, my mother [Faye Stevenson Billingslea] was about seventeen or eighteen years old.  I do know that, and--but I don't know where, where exactly they met.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did your father work in the mills too, or did he--
Speaker 2: No, he worked in the, he worked like in nightclubs.  He was a bartender, stuff like that, and that's what he did pretty much for a living-- Okay.
Speaker 1: --you know, until he, until he moved into the [U.S. military] service.
Speaker 2: All right, so you said he went into the service in World War II [WWII], I guess, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah, he went in I want to say in--I think I was five years old.  I think I was five years old when he went into--
Speaker 2: About 1942?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, because I remember him going to the service and I remember going with him and he was stationed in Indiana somewhere and I remember living with him in Indiana at a very early age.  And then he ended up at, in California.  And they moved to California and I went out there for a little while and I went back to Youngstown and I would visit them occasionally.  I think I went to school out there one year, went to like, the third grade or something like that.  And it was at that time, it was called Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base [sic. Fairfield-Suisun Army Air Base], which is now Travis Air Force Base [Solano County, California].  And my father worked for General Travis [Robert F. Travis], so I met General Travis and General Travis' children.  And I used to run around the base and play with them; so that's how my mother got to California, my father got to go.
Speaker 2: Okay, so they, they basically stayed in California, or--
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah, once they, once they left and got to California, that's where they stayed.
Story_ID: 304093
Speaker 1: So your [maternal] grandparents [Ella Mae Stevenson and Gabriel Stevenson] basically raised you in Youngstown [Ohio] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but before we--can you describe your parents' [Faye Stevenson Billingslea and Robert L. Billingslea] personalities for us, and well, and your grandparents, too?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Who do you take after you think in your family the most, your grandparents or your parents, or--
Speaker 2: Probably, I probably take after my--my parents in terms of their personality, you know, my father was, was fairly outgoing kind of a person, loved by all you know, and so I kind of take after him and my mother was somewhat like that also.  My grandparents were good people, fun-loving people, but more serious, you know.  He was a very serious kind of, kind of a man, you know, I mean didn't, didn't play, you know what I mean?  He went to church, deacon in the church and that kind of thing.  Versus my, my father who, you know, didn't, didn't pretty much, you know--I never known him to go to church, you know.  My mother did because she was an organist in the church and sang in the choir and all that kind of stuff.  And I, I remember that kind of growing up.  And my aunt also was you know, pretty much in the church--so that was kind of how, how he was, you know.  He was sort of a wheeler-dealer kind of, kind of a guy, you know; I mean, very, very popular kind of a person.
Story_ID: 304094
Speaker 1: When you were eight years old you moved back to Youngstown [Ohio], I mean or, or nine, eight or nine (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I went out there for about, I want to say a year.  I'm not exactly sure how long I was in that school, but I know I couldn't, I couldn't handle it because I wanted to get back to Youngstown.  So I went back to Youngstown and pretty much, pretty much second or third grade if I remember correctly.  I was, I was there and then I went out there and then I came back.  And so, I, I would say maybe third, fourth grade on I was pretty much in Youngstown and I just, you know, we'd visit and that kind of thing, but I stayed, I stayed there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you actually liked Youngstown better than California?
Speaker 2: At that time yeah, oh yeah.  Yeah, Youngstown was, Youngstown was you know, I mean to me it, it was pretty good.  It was a pretty cool place to, to grow up you know.  I had a lot of you know, friends, who'd do the things I liked to do.  Life was good.
Speaker 1: Okay, now well, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, the smell was, was steel mills because that's what Youngstown is.  Youngstown had, you know, you know, several steel mills.  I mean, I could probably name four or five steel mills that were right there in Youngstown.  That was the lifeblood of, of that town, particularly for black folks that's where they worked and relatively they made good money, you know in, in the steel mills.  I mean, I, I, I remember working there for three weeks and man, I got that paycheck, it was, it was, it was pretty nice, you know.  But I mean I was like in, in between colleges, so that was some good money.  So, that's why I think they stayed, a lot of people stayed right there in Youngstown and people grew up there and that was it and they worked in the steel mill.  There was a lot of, a lot of nightclubs, you know, I got interested in music and became a pretty fair drummer.  So I played a lot, lot of music right around Youngstown, between Youngstown, Cleveland [Ohio] and Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  Youngstown was right in the middle almost.
Speaker 1: When, when did you start drumming?
Speaker 2: I started drumming when I was about twelve years old.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you drum in the public schools?  Did they--?
Speaker 2: Yes, I played in, I played, I played in the public schools.  And I was, when I was sixteen, man I had a union card.  So I was playing professionally at sixteen, you know, with some of the, some of the big boys (laughter) you know, in Youngstown.  And there were great musicians between Pittsburgh, Cleveland and Youngstown, I mean, you know, it wasn't no joke.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that was, that was what I loved to do you know.
Speaker 1: Now what were some of the other sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, when you say sounds, where we lived it wasn't, you know, we didn't hear sirens, sirens, you know, police.  It was a, it was a pretty, a pretty low-key black existence, you know.  The neighborhood, you know, you pretty much stayed in, in your neighborhood, although we'd go across town and it was, it was, it was good growing up.  Music was good; food was good, you know, smells of barbecue.  Some of the best barbecue I ever had in my life was right there in Youngstown (laughter).
Story_ID: 304095
Speaker 1: Well you were telling us during the break about some of the people that lived in the neighborhood [in Youngstown, Ohio] and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --just--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --kind of run down that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Paul [HistoryMaker Paul Brock], Paul asked about Nate Jones [HistoryMaker Nathaniel R. Jones] who was a, a prominent attorney out of Youngstown [Ohio].  Also he did work for the, he was a judge and he did work for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  And then right next door to me was another attorney, Napoleon Bell [Napoleon A. Bell] and then across the street there was a Herbert Armstrong [Herbert L. Armstrong], who became a, a principal, one of the first black principals in, in the City of Youngstown.  And then Mr. Layton [ph.] who was next door to him, he owned a, owned a grocery store, you know, a neighborhood grocery store a couple, couple blocks over.  So the neighborhood where I grew up there were some professionals and it was a neighborhood, I mean you, everybody was there, you know, so you could be the janitor, across the street the guy worked at--Mr. Freeman [ph.], he was, he worked for one of the country clubs, you know, he was a bartender.  Next door to him was, kind of diagonal across the street from me, was McCullough Williams [Jr.] who owned a funeral, you know, he was a--his father--but his father and he, McCullough Williams [Sr.], owned a funeral home [McCullough Williams Funeral Home; Sterling-McCullough Williams Funeral Home, Youngstown, Ohio].  So, you know, there was, it was a mix, a mixture of people that lived on this street.  But that's what, that's what the neighborhood was about, you know, I mean.  So you got a little bit of everything--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --there, you know, from the laborer to the attorney, to the storeowner, the entrepreneur to the steel workers were all there.

Speaker 1: How would you describe your, your personality as a little kid and how do you think people would describe you and see you?
Speaker 2: Oh I, I was, I guess I was fairly outgoing youngster and, you know, I, we had, had, you know, my followers or people that I hung out with all the time and that, and so I guess they would say I was an okay kid growing up.
Speaker 1: Well, you describe as your followers--now were you the leader (laughter) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I, I, I wouldn't say followers.  I shouldn't have said followers.  No, I wouldn't say I was, I wouldn't say I was a leader.  We, you know, there was just different personalities and we, we all kind of got together, you know and just hung out and did, and did those kind of things, you know, we were--never got into any, any real trouble at all.  And some of the people that I grew up with have gone on to do some pretty good things, you know.  Sometimes you, you look up and say, "Wow," you know, "Look at us, how did we do what we did coming from where we came?"  Because you know, in high school [South High School, Youngstown, Ohio] there wasn't a whole lot of incentive, incentive coming out of the, out of the high school, you know--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --all that was--it was a mixed high school, but--
Speaker 1: Oh, before we get to that--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --can we go to grade school first?
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: What, what was the name of your grade school?
Speaker 2: I went to, let's see, I went to Delason [Delason Elementary School, Youngstown, Ohio] and then Monroe [Monroe Elementary School, Youngstown, Ohio].
Speaker 1: How do you spell Delason?
Speaker 2: D-E-L-A-S-O-N, I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: Delason.
Speaker 1: --and then Monroe?
Speaker 2: And then Monroe, M-O-N-R-O-E, were the two high, I mean junior high, I mean elementary schools--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that I went to.
Speaker 1: So Monroe was an elementary?  What did (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Some, some, somehow they was--I don't know what happened whether they tore Delason down, or, or just what, or re-district or whatever, but I ended up going to Monroe and then from Monroe to Princeton [Princeton Junior High School, Youngstown, Ohio].  Princeton was a, was a--
Speaker 1: That's the junior high school?
Speaker 2: --junior high and now they call them middle schools, I guess.  It was a junior high and then high school, South High School [Youngstown, Ohio].
Story_ID: 304097
Speaker 1: How did you like school when you were coming up?
Speaker 2: Oh, I enjoyed it.  I mean it was, it was okay.  I wasn't, I wasn't you know, a great student.  I wasn't you know, I wasn't no A or B student.  I was--we were just getting by, you know.  We were, like I say, there was I, I, I guess there wasn't a whole lot of attention--the, the people in, my teachers in, in high school [South High School, Youngstown, Ohio] all thought I was going to be the musician.  So that's what I was encouraged to do, you know.  "You're a good musician," you know.  And never really got into the science or, or the math and all that kind of stuff no more than what I had to take.  But I wasn't really, really, really encouraged.  I don't think any of us were, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was, it, you know, it was, it was a good high school in, in terms of a mixture of people, you know.
Speaker 1: Were there black teachers in your high school?
Speaker 2: No.  I have never in my life had a black teacher, you know, and probably a shame, you know.  But where I grew up there were no, there were no black teachers.  There were no black teachers in my high school, junior high [Princeton Junior High School, Youngstown, Ohio], high school or, or elementary school [Delason Elementary School and Monroe Elementary School, Youngstown, Ohio], none.
Speaker 1: So the advice you got was basically none, I mean no advice really about how--you said that blacks students didn't receive any advice?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think you know, you know, some of the students in high school who played basketball, football, you know, did pretty well you know.  One guy, Pepper Martin [HistoryMaker Mel Watkins], you may know him, was in our high school and Pepper went on to be editor of The New York Times I believe and wrote a book, 'Dancing With Strangers[: A Memoir,' Mel Watkins] which is about growing up in Youngstown [Ohio].  When you get the chance read it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, it's--and you know, so, there were some people who came out of there, like I say, who, who've done, who've done well, but it was pretty much after high school, if you will.  You know how you kind of find yourself, you know (laughter), because I, I, I don't think most of us were encouraged to move on or go on, you know.
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers that, that you remember that really stood out in terms of encouraging you or teaching--
Speaker 2: In high school?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Or even grade school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--
Speaker 2: I can't say any of them were really that encouraging to--
Story_ID: 304098
Speaker 1: So your focal point for success is basically drumming, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yep, that was, that was my thing.  Yeah.  It was something that I could do and could do, you know, fairly well at that time and accolades that I got in high school [South High School, Youngstown, Ohio] was because of my musical ability.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So then you played--you said that you had your union card by the time that you were sixteen?
Speaker 2: Sixteen, yeah--
Speaker 1: So did, did you start off playing what, basically school band music, that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah I played, I played in the, in, in, in the marching band in high school you know.  And I had a jazz band in high school which I formed.  And I was voted the most, most musical, or whatever award there was in high school my senior year, you know.  So, that was, that was my, my claim to fame and then I, of course I played outside of high school, maybe a little bit too much, you know (laughter), looking back on it, but that was a way of making money, you know.
Speaker 1: Now what, what style did you play and did you have any--
Speaker 2: Oh I, we played everything man.  I mean, I, I played in polka bands, you know, rock and roll, rhythm and blues, jazz, you know, whatever, you know.  When I played, when I played with mostly other black musicians, it was mainly R&B and jazz.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you have any musical idols, or, or--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean--I won, I mean--Max Roach and Art Blakey were my two, two idols on drums, different styles, but then that's who I listened to the most, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is in the, talking about the early '50s [1950s] to mid-'50s [1950s], right, I mean?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So you graduated in what?
Speaker 2: Fifty-six [1956].
Speaker 1: Fifty-six [1956], okay, '56 [1956]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So that's like the beginning of the rock-n-roll period basically (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah, the rock-n-roll was not out that much.  It was more, you know, there was some, you know, rock bands but mostly it was the rhythm and blues and you know--
Speaker 1: That's what I mean.  And people, people refer to rock-n-roll--now they think of like long hair--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: --guys playing like way out guitar music--
Speaker 2: --no--
Speaker 1: But in those days, I mean like, like Chuck Berry and--
Speaker 2: Chuck Berry--
Speaker 1: --and you know and rock-n-rock musicians--
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: --I mean for those days, you know.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yes, rhythm and blues we called R&B.
Speaker 2: Right, that's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: R&B.  I think Elvis Presley came out some time right after that, or was coming out and playing which was more of the rock, if you will, kind of thing, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what was the name of your band?
Speaker 2: Oh, I, I mean, well I had a little group myself there, I, we called it what, Bobby B Orchestra [ph.] or something like that.  I don't really know (laughter).  But I played with a lot of different musicians around town [Youngstown, Ohio], you know.  Whoever needed a drummer, you know, I played in a group called [The] Pacesetters.  I played with Little Murph [ph.], and Big Daddy D [ph.], and I played with a whole lot of guys that could, you know, really play, I mean really play during our time, and, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you, did you--
Speaker 2: Hump Jones, piano player, was a good piano player--
Story_ID: 304099
Speaker 1: So were you involved in any other social activities in high school [South High School, Youngstown, Ohio] or clubs, or any, any, were there any particular subjects that, that you know, you focused on other than music?
Speaker 2: No, not, not, no, nothing other than what, what I had to do to, you know, get through, you know (laughter).  So it, it wasn't, I can't remember being in like the English club, or Spanish club, or anything like that, no.
Speaker 1: Now did you play sports at all (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, I did--we, we, we did.  I was involved in a Y [Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA)], in a Y, I can't think of the name of that, there was a group at the Y, YMCA and I was involved in that and I became like the president of that club.  I can't think of the name of it now, but it was, it was both, both male and female.  And gosh, I'm trying to think of Shirley's last name--Cosby; she's married now, Shirley Cosby [ph.].  She was, she, she was a person that was, you know, it's, it's called Y-Teens, or something like that, you know.  So I was involved in that, that kind of thing.  So that was sort of a social thing that we, we did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, well, when you were on the verge of graduating from high school, did you know what you were going to do?  Did you think you'd just go on and be a professional musician, or--
Speaker 2: Well, I kind of knew that I was going to go to college.  That was sort of stated early on--my [maternal] grandparents [Ella Mae Stevenson and Gabriel Stevenson] and my parents [Faye Stevenson Billingslea and Robert L. Billingslea], "You're going to go to college," that kind of thing.  So I kind of knew that.  Did I know what I was going to do? Not really, you know.  I was going to major in music, yeah, I thought that was going to be what I was going to do, you know.  And, so that was sort of my, my, my way out if you will, or what I was going to do in life, was going to play music you know, so that was what I focused on.
Story_ID: 304100
Speaker 1: What college did you go to (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I, I went, well when I graduated [from South High School, Youngstown, Ohio], I went--well, when my mother [Faye Stevenson Billingslea] and father [Robert L. Billingslea] had, by this time they had separated.  So I went, went out to California and stayed out there with my mother and my stepfather at the time, and I went to junior college and I took music courses and I did, did well my first year.
Speaker 1: Now what junior college did you go to?
Speaker 2: It was called Vallejo, Vallejo Junior College [Solano Community College, Fairfield, California].
Speaker 1: Okay. That's V-A-L-L-E-J-O?
Speaker 2: V-A-L-L-E-J-O.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, and I took a lot of courses in music.  I mean I was, I was--it was good, it, it was good.  I, I got there and pretty much made my way to be the drummer in, in the orchestra we had and we went over to San Francisco [California] and we cut an album.  At that time it was a 78, big 78, you know.  And we had a big, big group, about I don't know, maybe seventeen to twenty musicians.  And--
Speaker 1: Like a big band or something?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah big band and--which was a little different coming from Ohio or the East Coast 'cause more, more, more ensembles, more, you know, quartets or quintets or things like that.  And I got there and it was more, you know, focused more on, on larger groups, you know.  It was more of a West Coast sound than an East Coast sound.  And, and I got kind of entrenched in that and ended up with a guy who I played with, we had a little radio show on Saturdays.  Man, we, we had a radio show playing live music, you know.  So that was, that was a big step for me.
Speaker 1: What was the name of your show?
Speaker 2: I don't remember (laughter).  I can't remember what it was, or the name of the group.  It was like, it was like a trio or quartet.  And so I did, I did well.  I just kind of got homesick again and decided I was going to go back east.
Speaker 1: So when did you--how, how long did you stay in California?
Speaker 2: A year.
Speaker 1: A year, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I stayed there a year and--
Speaker 1: So you came back in '57 [1957]?
Speaker 2: About '58 [1958], yeah '57 [1957], '58 [1958]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --something like that and decided I was going to go back to, back to Ohio and that's what I did.
Story_ID: 304101
Speaker 1: Okay, so what did you do when you came back [to Ohio]?  Did you--
Speaker 2: I went to college.  I stayed in school.
Speaker 1: Okay, now where did you go when (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I went to Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went to Ohio State for--I was there for maybe, maybe two quarters, something like that, Ohio State.  That was, that was a different experience (laughter).
Speaker 1: So what, what were--
Speaker 2: Man, you could say I lost focus (laughter).  It was, it was, it, it was fun.  I concentrated too much on, let's say social life and, and playing music in, in the town of Columbus [Ohio] and, and didn't do well.  So at the end of that experience I, I went on the road and, and played music around, around Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania and I did that, then I went back to college.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how long was it before you went back to college?
Speaker 2: About a year.
Speaker 1: About a year, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A year or so, yeah.
Speaker 1: You travelled so, so now I'm back to like '59 [1959] or '60 [1960], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Then you went back to Ohio State?
Speaker 2: No, I went to Kent, Kent State.
Speaker 1: Kent State, okay.
Speaker 2: Kent State University [Kent, Ohio].
Speaker 1: That's nineteen--about 1960 I guess?
Speaker 2: Around, yeah, yeah about, about '60 [1960] and went, went there and I ended up graduating from, from Kent State.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you get a degree in music?
Speaker 2: No, a degree, my degree was in sociology and I think my minor was in psychology or speech and speech or something like that.
Speaker 1: Now, why did you choose those instead of pursuing music?
Speaker 2: Well, because when I, when I, when I finally got to Ohio State I, I really kind of got sick, I mean Kent State, I really got kind of serious about school and, and had some mentors and Don Henderson, who is Dr. Don Henderson, who was, I guess, my prime, my prime mentor at the time and I stayed with him.  He was from Youngstown [Ohio].  He was getting his master's [degree], and got in a fraternity [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity] and just started thinking seriously about, okay, you know, "What you going to do?" you know, "You done fooled around a little bit now, okay." you know, played the music and hit a school here, hit a school there, and, you know, it's funny how sometimes things just kind of happen to kind of motivate you to do things.  And, and, and seeing these guys and how they were in the academics and focusing on, on their books and things of that nature and, and my, and my parents [Faye Stevenson Billingslea and Robert L. Billingslea] and [maternal] grandparents [Ella Mae Stevenson and Gabriel Stevenson] had been very, very good to me in, in terms of financing my education.  And I heard a song one day and that song was 'God Bless The Child That's Got His Own' ['God Bless the Child'].  And for some reason it just hit me and it kind of motivated me to go on and get serious about school and, and get out of there and be a man, take care of myself and get it going; that's what I did.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So--
Speaker 2: Yeah. And in sociology because Don was in, in sociology and I thought maybe that was what I wanted to do and that's, that's what happened.
Story_ID: 304102
Speaker 1: So you graduated [from Kent State University, Kent, Ohio] in--was it in '60 [1960]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: Sixty-four [1964], okay.
Speaker 2: Graduated in '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I worked, I worked my last year or so at juvenile court.  One of my professors over at, at Kent asked me did I want to, want a job, and I told him, "Yep."  And he, he got me situated over at that juvenile court and I worked, I worked over there in the--from like two [o'clock] in the afternoon until ten [o'clock] at night.  And I was sort of, what they called, they called it an organizer, what they called that job, I can't remember the name, but what it was, was that I oversaw some of the juveniles who were in, in the court system, and I would relieve some of the guys who were the group leaders when they'd go on break or stuff like that.  So I got pretty much interested in that kind of work and so I, I worked over there about a little over a year, over a year at juvenile court.  And then, then when I graduated I, I got interviewed and I became a probation officer.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this was '64 [1964], you're a probation officer in--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --in, in Columbus [Ohio]--
Speaker 2: A probation officer.
Speaker 1: --or in--
Speaker 2: Akron [Ohio].
Speaker 1: --Akron, okay.
Speaker 2: Summit County Juvenile Court [Akron, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Okay, now, how did you like that?  I mean did you--
Speaker 2: I loved it.  I really did.  I, I enjoyed what I was doing.  It was helping, you know helping kids who were in, in need of attention.  Who were in need of love and I was pretty good at it.  I was very popular, you know, when, you know, when the juveniles, you know when they were you know, in--incarcerated, let's say in the juvenile detention center it made you feel good when they would you know, say, "Man, that's my PO," or, "That's my probation officer," you know.  It was sort of a pride thing, you know.  And so I, I enjoyed it.  And I, I think I really helped a lot of kids turn their life around at that time.  So I did that for a while.
Speaker 1: All right, so how, how long were you in--
Speaker 2: I, I worked at juvenile court for about a year and a half.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Year and a half.
Story_ID: 304103
Speaker 1: Then where did you go [after Summit County Juvenile Court, Akron, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Well, then I went to--at that time you may remember the Office of Economic Opportunity, OEO (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) OEO, yeah, right--
Speaker 2: Yeah. And some guys talked to me about coming over to work, work in the Office of Economic Opportunity and I said, "Well, that, that sounds okay."  It was a whole lot more money at that time, you know.  Probation officer wasn't making a whole lot of money and at OEO, man, they were paying some pretty good money.
Speaker 1: This was for the federal government?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So were you stationed in Ohio or were you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right there, right in Akron [Ohio].
Speaker 1: Right in Akron, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And I was called a community organizer, I believe.
Speaker 1: So you were a community organizer for OEO?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, Office of Economic Opportunity, yeah.
Speaker 1: So what did you have to do, I mean what were your duties?
Speaker 2: Well, I was supposed to organize communities, and the people in that community to, you know do better, you know, get jobs, help them get jobs, those kinds of things; have meetings--
Speaker 1: So is this like--
Speaker 2: After three months, man, I, I, I couldn't I couldn't hack it.
Speaker 1: Is this like classic community organizing, like the (unclear) type you knock on doors and, and, and try to you know, form like community groups?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah, right that's what it was.
Speaker 1: --and trying to find out what their interest is, and then trying--
Speaker 2: Right, trying to move their lifestyles up, you know--
Speaker 1: --consolidate their power.
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.  That's, that's pretty much what it was.  But it did, it just, it did, it wasn't, it wasn't gratifying, you know.  It was like, I don't know how to explain it, but in juvenile court I could see the end product, you know, I know what I was doing, I, and I could you know, work with the kids, get them off probation, and get them out of trouble and it was rewarding.  Over there it was like mass confusion, you know, and I, I couldn't, couldn't figure out what was, what was really going on.  What were we supposed to do, how we were going to get this thing moving.  And after three months, I said, "Man, I, I can't do this."
Story_ID: 304104
Speaker 1: And a friend of mine told me that I, I should go to a, a headhunter, which I didn't even know what a headhunter was.  "What's a headhunter?"  But they'll find you jobs.  And this guy had been a professional football player from my hometown [Youngstown, Ohio] and--
Speaker 2: Who, who, who was it?
Speaker 1: --Larry Jordan.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Larry Jordan, he played for San Diego [sic. Denver Broncos] and he went to Youngstown State [Youngstown University; Youngstown State University, Youngstown, Ohio], got drafted, and so we were good friends and so Larry said, "Man, you go and talk to these people and they'll hook you up for a job."  So, that's what I did.  And you know it's like, "What am I going to do?"  I wanted to, I wanted to, I thought get into corporate America, you know.  And I figured that's something I can do, you know.  And, so I went down there and they were going to, they had an interview for me with something, I believe it was Wisconsin, some kind of camp, or running something like that, you know, through the, you know, social, social work kind, kind of a job.  And I never did see the people because I was sitting there and when a gentleman walked over to me, he said, "Hey, this guy over here wants to talk to you."  I said, "About what?"  He said, "About, about a job in, in, maybe in Florida."  I said, "A job in Florida.  What kind of job?"  "Well, you need to talk to him," you know.  So I went in and I talked to this guy about a job and, and I'd been sitting there and I'd been watching these people walk back and forth with their briefcases, I said, "Man, that looks pretty cool" you know, "I think I want to do something, whatever they do," you know.  They were interviewers.  And this gentleman talked to me about coming down to Orlando, Florida and at that time it was, it was Martin Marietta Corporation [Lockheed Martin].  And he said, "Would you like to--like a job in Orlando, or come down and interview?"  And I said, "Well, yeah."  Now to be honest with you I, I had no intentions, I didn't think, of going to Florida, living in Florida.  I was raised up north.  I'd lived in California.  The South did not appeal to me.  But I said, "Well, I'll, I'll, I'll check it out."
Story_ID: 304105
Speaker 1: Okay so you're on the verge of taking this job [at Martin Marietta Corporation; Lockheed Martin] in Florida, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--I went down to, to Florida.  A guy by the name of Pat Vaughn who interviewed me initially up in Akron [Ohio]--and I went down to Orlando [Florida] and interviewed down there, and I ended up with the job offer.  So at that point I had to make a decision, you know, as to what am I going to do.  And I wanted to get into corporate America and so I said, "Well, you know, let me, let me try it out," so that's what I did.  I, I had a--my son was like very young at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay now, we skipped something.  Now you got married apparently or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, yeah.  I got married--
Speaker 1: --yeah, or something happened.
Speaker 2: --in, back in '65 [1965].
Speaker 1: Okay, now where did you meet your wife?
Speaker 2: I met her at, at Kent [Kent State University], in, in Kent, Ohio, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so we, we had a son and I think when I--my son was like, I want to say four weeks old, or something like that when I headed off to Orlando, Florida, a place I never thought in my wildest imagination that I would ever live.  I'd never even been to Florida, you know.
Speaker 1: And you were going south, now, now--
Speaker 2: I was going south.
Speaker 1: --had you, you know, been, well I guess you had been following the Civil Rights Movement on some level in those days--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah, yeah, but I was, I was--
Speaker 1: --television and you know, and did--what were your notions of what the South was like?
Speaker 2: Well, it was like, you know, I use to go South just about every year, every other year for sure because my [maternal] grandfather [Gabriel Stevenson] would go, would take us back to his hometown.
Speaker 1: Back to Georgia?
Speaker 2: Back to Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So as a kid I remember we'd get in the car and we'd pack the lunchboxes and chicken, devil eggs and then the food--because you know, after you left Cincinnati [Ohio], you know, it was like roll the windows up and you don't talk to nobody and, and, and you just head down, down south.  So I didn't have a real good you know, image of, of the South at all.  As soon as you crossed that Mason Dixon Line, man, it was you know, and you got into Kentucky and Tennessee and on down in Georgia, it was you know, you couldn't stop, you know.  We'd always stop in Cincinnati because we had relatives there; spend the night there and then get on the road the next day and go down south, you know.  So, so my images of, of the South wasn't, wasn't very good.
Story_ID: 304106
Speaker 1: I didn't know really what, to, to expect when I was moving down there [to Orlando, Florida].  So I, when I got there I, you know, got into my work, got into the job and I enjoyed what I was, what I was doing.  I, I learned a lot.  I worked in the, in, they called wage and salary, and which I didn't know; I didn't have the foggiest idea what wage and salary compensation was.  I had no knowledge whatsoever; but that's what I did.  And it was a great learning experience because you learned about all the jobs in that particular industry.  And you learned how to write job descriptions.  You learned how to peg people's salary, what you want to pay them, or what they should be paid, you know, based upon information that you would gather.  I worked with, with the labor people, and the employee relation's people.  They used me to do a lot of recruiting and I, I would recruit particularly at the historically black colleges, universities [HBCUs].  And so that's what I kind of wanted to do in the first place.  There were no openings when I first got there to go into the interviewing or recruiting kind of stage.  So they would use me to do that.  And so I used to go on a lot of recruiting trips for, for Martin Marietta Corporation and recruit engineers, mainly engineers, and finance people, people like that.  So it was, it was a great learning experience for me.
Speaker 2: Now, now what does Martin Marietta do?
Speaker 1: Martin Marietta, it's now Lockheed Martin--
Speaker 2: Lockheed, okay--
Speaker 1: --aerospace.
Speaker 2: All right, okay.
Speaker 1: Aerospace, yeah, they're now Lockheed Martin.  And they were at that time, the largest employer in, in the Orlando [Florida] area, you know.  So that was, so they had a good brand.
Speaker 2: That's right, they were like pushing the envelope a little bit in, in Orlando in terms of race relations and sort of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah they were.  The schools were, had just begun to be integrated.  But what they were talking about when they were talking about integration at that time, it was the white teachers in black schools and some black teachers in white schools, you know.  And that's, that's how they kind of started, you know.
Story_ID: 304107
Speaker 1: I became fairly active in, in, in race relations, in human relations, in the Orlando [Florida] area at that time.
Speaker 2: Now had you ever been active before in, in anything like that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Not, not really, not really.  My uncle was, was, was very active.  In growing up I remember back in Youngstown [Ohio], you know, there was segregation--swimming pools, you know, there was a swimming pool for the black people and swimming pools for white people.  And one of the biggest things I remember is that they were, they were going to try to integrate swimming pools, which they did, but that was, I mean that was really, I mean that was, that was civil rights, you know, what, what I saw growing up how they were doing that, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because Youngstown's an activist city, you know, with the unions, black organizations (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Youngstown's always been a--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 2: --strong kind of activist kind of city.
Speaker 1: --so it was, it was you know, so, that, that was my, you know, sort of entre into the Civil Rights Movement.  And when I got down to Orlando I became involved with human relations stuff and things like that and helped move the needle down there.  And I ended up, I worked, well that's after I came back, because I was there for three years in Orlando working in aerospace [at Martin Marietta Corporation; Lockheed Martin].  The same gentleman, Pat Vaughn who'd hired, or got me down to Florida was leaving to go to Disney [The Walt Disney Company, Burbank, California], so I went in his office one day and I said, "Well, Pat you hired me once, you can do it again."  And he said, "You ready to leave?"  And I said, "Well, hey, you're going to Disney."  Now, my motivation was to get out of Florida, to be honest with you (laughter), you know, to California, my mother [Faye Stevenson Billingslea] was there and that's what I, I thought I wanted to do.  And about four or five months later he told me somebody was going to come down and interview me for, for a position at Disneyland [Anaheim, California].
Story_ID: 304108
Speaker 1: Now what year is this?
Speaker 2: Sixty-nine [1969].
Speaker 1: Sixty-nine [1969] okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  So I went out there [Anaheim, California] in 1969 and I worked at, at Disneyland for a year and a half and it was, I mean, the ironic part about it is that it was like, "Well, we want you to come out to Disneyland and sort of train and learn the ropes, learn about theme parks because we're going to send you back and when we open up Walt Disney World [Orlando, Florida], you will be on the opening team of Walt Disney World."  I said, "Man," (laughter), "okay," but my intentions were, let me get to California first and then I'll sort through all this because that's where I wanted to be.
Speaker 1: Now, now what were your impressions of, of Disneyland and Walt Disney [The Walt Disney Company, Burbank, California] at that juncture?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I, I, I knew that Disneyland did not have a, a good reputation in terms of hiring black folks, I knew that going in, you know.  But I, I thought I could probably help out, you know.  And, and they hired me out there and I did, you know.  I did a lot, I did some recruiting particularly at colleges for intern programs.  People were going to come out there and, and train to go back to Florida and things of that nature.  So, so I, I worked that and, and enjoyed what I was doing, you know.  The Anaheim [California] area is, is not, is not known for (laughter), you know, for civil rights, if you will.  There were very, very few, very few black people in, in Orange County [California], you know, very few.  So there was a lot of work to be done in that particular area.  So I stayed there for a year and a half and went back to Florida--
Speaker 1: Okay, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and went back with Disney.
Speaker 1: --so now about 1971?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy [1970].  I was there--
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy [1970].
Speaker 2: --a year and a half.  From--sounds like a year, when you say '69 [1969] to '70 [1970], but it was really a year and a half--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --from the time I got there 'til the time I got back.
Story_ID: 304109
Speaker 1: And then that's when I, you know, when I got back to Florida I really got involved in, in, in local human relations kind of, kinds of things down in Orlando [Florida] at that time.  I served on the mayor's [Carl T. Langford] Human Relations Advisory Board.  And we really, we really did some things there.  We, we raised the bar and I became, I think I became the chairman, or president of the Orlando Human Relations Advisory Board and at that time we had set out, we had three things on our agenda that we wanted to do.  One, we wanted to establish a human relations department and two, we wanted to get an ordinance to support it and make it meaningful in terms of accountability.  And then the third thing we wanted to do was single-member district voting.  So those are the three things while I was, I was president of that, of that body--and we did it.  We did, we did, we got, we got the department, we got the ordinances to support the department and then about a couple of years later we were successful in getting single member district voting.  To be honest with you they didn't, I think they voted on it, but, you know, it was one of these things where, "We'll let them have it, but, you know, it's going to fail."  So they gave us very little money to run the department.  And I interviewed people for that job because I was the president and found a gentleman by the name of Al Nelson, who was getting his master's [degree] out of North Carolina, the University of North Carolina, who was from the Orlando area.  He grew up in Orlando, went to South Carolina, Johnson C. Smith [Johnson C. Smith University, Charlotte, North Carolina], I believe and then on to the University of North Carolina.  So we hired him.  I think we got $38,000 to hire furniture person, a secretary and buy furniture (laughter), you know.  So, it, it was, they, they really kind of set us up to fail.  But, we won out.  Al's a dynamic person.  He stayed there for twenty-one years, twenty-two years in that position.  And that human relations department was one of the best run, had most power of any civil rights organizations of its kind in the State of Florida.  So I was very proud, proud of that and then we established the review board.  So this was, this was some powerful stuff, you know.  And then I went on from there to the Florida Commission on Human Relations.  And I, and I worked on the, I worked there.  I was on that commission for twelve years I believe.  And I was chairman of that commission for my last two years that I was on there.  I was appointed by at least three governors, three or four governors to that position.  And we did some pretty good things.  Florida started really moving in that, in the area of civil rights.  We had, you know, we had same status as--we had seminal six status, which is the same thing that the EEOC [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] had, so there were representatives like the EEOC.  People could file charges, they'd dual file them with the federal government.  So we were really proud of a lot of work that we did at that time.
Speaker 2: Is there a particular story that, that sticks out as something that was done that you can tell us about?
Speaker 1: Well, not, not a particular one, but we, we handled a lot of charges of discrimination because we had, we had that power and we, and we, we, we really changed the landscape of, of Florida in terms of discrimination.  So, you know, we, we were a powerful group and we had some great people to work with at that particular time, you know.  It started out I think, I was appointed by Askew [Governor Reubin Askew], [Governor] Bob Graham for sure, then there was another governor, I can't think who that was, who also appointed me to that commission [Florida Commission on Human Relations].
Speaker 2: Is that Reubin Askew, or--
Speaker 1: Yes, Reubin Askew, Bob Graham and I want to say Martinez, I want to say [Governor] Bob Martinez, something like that, was a governor.  So I did a lot of work at the state level and then I, I was appointed to the, the, can't remember the name of the office now, but it had to do with training and stuff of that nature on, on a state level.  So we had some, we had some, we had, you know, twelve or thirteen real good years of getting policies in place that would prohibit discrimination with respect of employment, you know, for the protected class at that time.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, now had, now this is separate from your work at Disney [The Walt Disney Company, Burbank, California]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, so that's--yeah--
Speaker 1: --I still had my paying job (laughter).
Story_ID: 304110
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, how were things at Disney [The Walt Disney Company, Burbank, California], I mean how did that--were there any stories from your work at Disney you can tell us?
Speaker 1: Well, well, they let me do that, you know.  And, and, and I think what it did it set a higher standard for where we were, you know, certainly if I'm out there you know, doing this on a state level and, and chairman of it that, that set a higher standard for us.  I think we were better off for it you know, because you know, my philosophy and it differs from, from a lot of people's philosophy.  See, I don't look at those agencies as--as adverse kind of agencies, you know what I mean.  I look at them more as a friendship, the same way I look at the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  Whereas a lot of companies would shy away from that you know.  But it, it helps you know, in my opinion because if things are going wrong they are going to tell you.  And you work with them and you solve the problem, you know.  You don't wait until they knock on the door; you work with them all the time.  And that's been my philosophy in working with, you know, social agencies or social justice agencies, the Urban Leagues [National Urban League] or any of those agencies.  That, that philosophy doesn't hold true for a lot of people, you know.  They don't, they, they say they don't won't to deal with it, you know, want you to go away and that was just my philosophy.  And that's how I worked, worked it for all these years, you know.  So I was, we were great friends with the office, I mean EEOC [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] for twenty years I was the chief affirmative action officer, if you will.  My title was the director of equal opportunity programs for The Walt Disney Company.  So, I, I, I, I remained on the Florida Commission [Florida Commission on Human Relations].  I was on those kinds of organizations, so I went to the, a lot of the conferences, the (unclear) conference and those kinds of things.  They knew me and I think it helped our company.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And still helps our company today I think.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Is there any particular story about a tough case that you had to deal with that you can tell us about?
Speaker 1: No, none that I better--want to tell you about (laughter), that I can say, I can tell you about; but we've had some tough ones.  Yeah, we've had some (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But you don't have to give the names you know--
Speaker 1: --some pretty tough, tough cases.
Speaker 2: --but maybe you can tell us about something, I mean, for instance, you know, you can--
Speaker 1: Well you know, I mean, we, we, we, we've had, we've had cases of discrimination that could have been some class action, you know, suits, that we were able to, to ward off, you know, those kinds of things.  But, not, none, none really comes to mind that are earth, earth shattering, you know, no more than any other company that would have some charges, you know, but we, we were able to overcome and I think it's--a lot of it has to do with, do with your philosophy or your willingness to work with, with the organizations and treat them with respect and vice-versa.
Story_ID: 304111
Speaker 1: Time to ask you about the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, I don't.  I'll--well tell us how you got involved in the NAACP for the first time?
Speaker 2: Well, my first real introduction on a corporate level was back in 1985 and that was during the time that the, the, that the NAACP were looking at the studios, and they were looking at particularly with blacks in front of and behind the camera.  So I became very much involved with that in, in putting a package together and that's where I say the philosophy was, "Hey," you know, "Let's, let's work with the people," you know.  "Let's show them what we have."  And at that time they had the fair share agreements.  And, and I took a look at what the fair share agreements were that they had signed with some other companies and I said, you know, we're doing a lot of these things, you know.  Some of the things, yeah, we, we got a lot of work to do, but in, in, in terms of you know, top employment, we, we had some work to do.  In terms of blacks in front of and behind the camera, we had a lot of work to do.  In terms of--of blacks or other minorities on the boards of the, the, the board of directors, we had some work to do.  In terms of, of philanthropic giving we were okay.  In terms of our, some of the programs we were doing, of inclusion, we, we had some, some pretty good programs together.  So I took a look at everything and put it all together, we weren't as bad off as one would think.  And so, I encouraged our company [The Walt Disney Company, Burbank, California] to sign a letter of understanding with the NAACP and let's work with them.  So what we did, we, we formed two committees, review committees, if you will, monitoring committees; one was in-house for us, and, and the NAACP had one.  So we would meet at least once a year and go over all these things that I just talked about, and we got blacks on the board.  We, we, we worked with, you know, with the union people and stuff and trying to get, get the blacks behind the camera, you know, and, and some of those, which is, which is tough, tough to do.  But we've, we've done some of that.
Speaker 1: So they guard that pretty jealously I guess, you know, when the, the people that--the white cameramen kind of guard that.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, very much (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) From what I've heard it's kind of passed down from one generation to the next one.
Speaker 2: --oh, yeah, yes, yeah, it's, it's tough, you know.  And we, then we started working on you know, doing things, with, you know, getting blacks in front of the camera as actors and actresses.  So we put a lot of things in place.  And, and I, I think now if you look at us and look at us, some of our, our films, look at our TVs, you know, we're, we're, we're a whole lot better than we were.  And we're, you know we're, I would say one of the leaders in, in the industry in that regard now, but it took, it took some time and it took some convincing of people that this is what we need to do.
Story_ID: 304112
Speaker 1: Did you have much interaction with the Hollywood Branch of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --[HistoryMaker] Willis Edwards and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Hollywood, Beverly Hills Branch.  Yeah, and we [The Walt Disney Company, Burbank, California] worked with them a lot.  I was able to--the one thing that I was, I was kind of most proud of is that I got our people you know, to start reading scripts that were written by African Americans.  And at that time Jeffrey Katzenberg signed David Hoberman, who worked for him as, as a, as a, as a focal point.  So there was an organization called the Association of African Americans in television and motion pictures, something like that.  And a guy by the name of John Forbes was the president of it at that time and so anyone who was a member of that association could forward scripts to us and they would take a look at them.  So that took some doing and it took some convincing that we need to do this, you know and, and see if there is something there.  So, and we worked with oh, I can't think of her name now, when she was president of the Hollywood Branch.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Sandra Evers-Manly.
Speaker 2: Sandra Evers-Manly, still very active in, in Los Angeles [California] in doing some, some things; worked with Sandra and Sandra had a, I mean she could pick up the phone, call Jeffrey Katzenberg, sit down with him, who was at that time was the, you know--Michael Eisner came on in '85 [1985] and Jeffrey Katzenberg, and those, those people.  So we had a, you know, so we had, we started working on some things to, to, to make things happen in that industry, which is a tough industry, it really is.  And then since that time we've had you know, we have now three minorities on our board, one African American.  We've had as many as two at one time, Sidney Poitier being one and so it's almost now, that that's you know, a foregone conclusion that there will be some minority representation on our board of directors.  So I think we've got about nine percent (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: Something like that, yeah.
Story_ID: 304113
Speaker 1: We [The Walt Disney Company, Burbank, California] agreed that we would maintain a, a percentage of, of blacks and minorities on our, in, in our employment force and we've done that, you know.  And we established the supplier diversity arm to, to look at that and so all, all these things came about as a result of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], [HistoryMaker Reverend] Benjamin Hooks coming out there and sitting down and we've had some real good meetings (laughter), you know, with our chairman of the board at the time.  But at the time, backup a couple of times, that was before Eisner [Michael Eisner] because it was Card Walker and Donn Tatum, they were the actual ones who signed the statement of understanding that we have.
Speaker 2: So prior to Michael Eisner.
Speaker 1: It was prior to Michael Eisner, right.  So, so that's been a, been a good document, keep us focused on what we need to be doing, you know.  We've grown tremendously since that time because matter-of-fact during that time, it was only, it was only the Disneyland [Anaheim, California], Walt Disney World [Orlando, Florida] and the motion picture company [Walt Disney Studios, Burbank, California].  And we have consumer products and some other little companies, but we didn't have ABC, we didn't have ESPN.  We didn't have all these other companies that we have--there was no, no Tokyo [Tokyo Disney Resort, Urayasu, Japan], no, no, no Europe [Euro Disney Resort; Disneyland Paris, Marne-la-Vallee, France], you know.  The theme parks were just a very small, small group of people, you know.  Walt Disney World, which is still the largest of all of the so-called business units has grown now to about fifty-something thousand, just in that one location.  So we still work at it, you know.
Story_ID: 304114
Speaker 1: Are you ever called in to talk about the, the content of Disney movies in terms of the, the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I have been--
Speaker 1: --racial implications?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I have been on occasion, you know, the, the--what comes to mind is a movie 'Song of the South.'  There have been occasions when some people want to release that and others are saying, "No, let's not release that."  And I'm one of those who would say, "We [The Walt Disney Company, Burbank, California] don't need to release that."
Speaker 1: That's the one that features Uncle Remus, right?
Speaker 2: Uncle Remus, right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Br'er Rabbit and Tar Baby.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, yeah, you know, I, I, I don't see any redeeming value, if you will, in releasing that, that movie, you know, I'm not, I'm not the last word on it though you know, but if asked I, I, I say "No."  I've said no before and we haven't released it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Disney was criticized a few years ago for having a--for putting out 'Tarzan' with, with no--in Africa, with no black people whatsoever (laughter) in the movie.  Is, is--
Speaker 2: Is that right?  I don't remember that one--
Speaker 1: Did people talk about that, that at all?
Speaker 2: I don't remember that one.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'Tarzan,' the Disney 'Tarzan' was a--actually, it was a very entertaining movie for kids, they, they liked it but there are--
Speaker 2: Was there animation or something?
Speaker 1: Yes, animated.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: With--Tarzan is, is white.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: He's a European and his--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, Jane and her father--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --is a hunter that's a bad guy.  He's a white guy.  And there is a ship crew but there is not a single black person in the movie and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, see that shouldn't happen--
Speaker 1: --and it takes place in Africa you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, and then--
Speaker 1: --and animals.
Speaker 2: --and, and those kinds of things should not happen and, and we try to, you know, you know, raise the conscious level of the people who are in, in the film industry that, you know, these things shouldn't happen.  And you know, we've been successful in, you know, most, most of the time, but every now and then something like that will happen.  And you say, "Well where did that come from?" you know, so, yeah.
Speaker 1: And people kind of notice that.  It was, you know, it was a good, a popular movie, too.  I mean, a lot of kids watched, a lot of black kids, you know, watched it--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and they liked the music--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and the story, but it, you know--
Speaker 2: Well that's a matter of, of, you know, of, of talking diversity, you know, and keeping it on everybody's mind all the time, you know.
Speaker 1: You know, I wondered if there was a discussion about the reason, I mean, about, about not having Africans in because they were worried if they did they would somehow offend black people by having, by misinterpreting that--the Africans in the movie.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I mean, how it misrepresented Africa in the movie.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I wondered if that was it.  I don't know if there was a discussion that you heard of?
Speaker 2: I, that, that I really don't know.
Speaker 1: But by avoiding any at all it raised another question, why--
Speaker 2: Right, of yeah, why (laughter), right.
Speaker 1: --African people in Africa, you know, so.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I think the same for 'Lion King' ['The Lion King'].  There was, there's not a single, in fact--
Speaker 2: No, 'Lion King.'
Speaker 1: --there's not a single human in 'Lion King' though, to tell the truth.  I don't think there's a human--
Speaker 2: Yeah, everything is--is, you know, is animation, you know, and it's animals.  Which is a, a great movie and they've gotten a lot of accolades about 'Lion King' on Broadway.  I don't know whether you've ever seen it, but it is--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Have you seen it, yeah?  It's--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm seen parts of the Broadway version.  I've never seen the whole--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well you to, you need to see that.  It's, you know, it's a great, great production.
Speaker 1: Is that the movie you think you've--I mean it's done the most good in terms of race relations in terms of with, with--in Disney?
Speaker 2: Well, there, there's several, you know, movies, I think 'Remember the Titans,' I think was one that was, you know, a very good movie about race relations and a true story.  And then 'The Lion King' is just, just a great, great story.  And, you know, if you go on Broadway you'll see almost all the cast, maybe for exception of maybe two people, are of African American, or African descent.  So that's, that's helped, you know.  So it's things like that.  You know we try to, you know, in all of our businesses, we try to make sure that we, we have diverse talent, you know, whether it's, whether it's on TV, you know, ABC, or ESPN, you know, or our motion picture company [Walt Disney Studios, Burbank, California], so, or whatever we produce, you know, with a constant reminder that we have to be, be diverse.
Story_ID: 304115
Speaker 1: Tell me about ACT-SO [Afro-Academic, Cultural, Technological and Scientific Olympics] and your involvement. Now you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah--I'm involved, you know--getting back to the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], there are several committees and things that I, I sit on.  One is the [NAACP] Image Awards committee and one is ACT-SO.  And then I've chaired in one of the motivators we had, Industry Advisory Council, which is a group of corporate people who supports ACT-SO financially, technically and whatever we can do.  But ACT-SO is, in my opinion, one of the best-kept secrets in the, in the NAACP movement.  And what it is, it's a, it's, it's a competition among mainly African American students in high school in twenty-five categories.  And it's ongoing.  The thing is it's just not a one-day, a one-day kind of a thing, but it, it, it happens all year long throughout the country in mentoring those students in those twenty-five categories, which range from math and science to the humanities, to poetry, oratory, dance, filmmaking, entrepreneurism, chemistry, biology, the whole works.  And it's a great program.  We culminate the awards with the, the, with the award show at the national convention [NAACP Annual Convention] each year where these students come together and they compete against each other for medals, just like the Olympics; gold, silver and bronze medals.  And they are giving--given monies and medals for, for winning in those categories.  A lot of corporations give them other, other things, for example, State Farm just this last, couple of days ago, every student that won a medal got a laptop computer from State Farm and it happens, I mean there's a lot of stuff like that.
Speaker 1: So how many are we talking about?  Was there one for each category, or, or what?
Speaker 2: There's, there's three winners in each category, you know, like I said, the bronze, silver and gold.
Speaker 1: So you are talking about seventy-five students got (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So you've got, you have twenty-five times three, seventy-five.  So that would give 'em, you know.
Story_ID: 304116
Speaker 1: I was chairman for about twelve years of the Industry Advisory Council.  And one of the things that the, the space--aeronautical people do is that they, they take the winners [of the Afro-Academic, Cultural, Technological and Scientific Olympics (ACT-SO)] in the, in the science categories to like a camp for about a week and these kids sit down with real rocket scientists.  I mean they really sit down and talk about their projects and they defend their projects as to why they did it and it's not, you know, tell me about your project, but they really delve into it and talk with these, with these students, man.  And these are, these are rocket scientists who quiz these kids on what they're doing.  And we--they have astronauts to come in and talk to them.  And we've been to Kennedy Space Center [Florida].  We've been to Ames Research Lab [Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California].  We've been to the one in Alabama and, and--I can't think of the name of it right now, Redstone Arsenal [Madison County, Alabama], whatever it is, in, in, in Alabama.  And I've gone with the kids and I've sat down through these camps and it's just unbelievable.  So these are the kinds of exposures that these students get.  This past, couple of days ago, Sunday, Berklee School of Music [Berklee College of Music, Boston, Massachusetts] gave, I want to say, at least ten scholarships to those people who were in music composition, whatever they do in, in the, in the arts and music.  So these are, these happen right, right in front of your very eyes, you know.  So it's a great program and it's a real, real good program.  And we're looking at ways to enhance the program.  We're--we're even thinking about maybe having its own, its, its own award show away from the convention [NAACP Annual Convention].  You know, if we can, we're doing a feasibility study right now to see if that's, if that's possible.  Which would give a little more, more recognition and hopefully more financial gains for the students.
Speaker 2: It seems like there, there's a lot potential there to, you know, raise money to send black kids to college--
Speaker 1: Um-hm oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --it seems like--
Speaker 1: Well they give--I mean as far as this competition, I think they get 500 [dollars], 750 [dollars] and 1,000 [dollars].  $1000 go to the, the gold and 750 to the silver, and I think 500 to the bronze.  That's what they get for, for winning.  But, yeah, a lot of, you know, you know, you know, my thing is at least the HBCUs ought to be there--historically black colleges and universities ought to be there to see these kids and offer them scholarships right off, you know, because they're there.
Story_ID: 304117
Speaker 1: And that's one of the directions we're trying to move in.  We, we just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So right, right now the HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities] are not--
Speaker 1: There's no formal program to get them there.  And I think that's something we need to take a look at.  We, we just completed a, a DVD which, you know, you would think we would have one by now, but we just completed one that, you know, would be a tool to show everybody what ACT-SO [Afro-Academic, Cultural, Technological and Scientific Olympics] is about, you know.  And it's, it's a real, real good, real good tool--marketing tool.  And then we can take out to the corporate America.  We can take to the HBCUs and say, "Look at this, you need to be here, or you need to support it because it is a great program."  And the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], you know, has been behind it.  We need more resources though.  And, that's one, one of the things we want to sit down with the new, with the new CEO, president [HistoryMaker Bruce Gordon] of, of the NAACP and hopefully get some, you know, more resources, more people on the payroll to help, to help run it.  And--
Speaker 2: How is it, is it run by volunteers now, mostly in the--
Speaker 1: Um-hm, yeah--
Speaker 2: --in the various cities--
Speaker 1: Well there is staff.  Yeah there is a staff but right now it's like maybe two people, you know.  But they, you know--
Speaker 2: --but they are operate out of, out of Baltimore [Maryland]?
Speaker 1: Out of Baltimore, um-hm.  Right.  And, and so but you have, you know, I'm, I'm not sure exactly how many students were here this, this year, but usually we run around 1000 to 1200 students; come from all over the country and you know, they have to get here.  Someone's got to pay, pay their way, put them up in a hotel for the time they're here for the competitions, which normally start--the competitions start on, on a Wednesday; Thursday, Friday and Saturday.  And we have judges.  One of the things we've done that I'm, I'm really proud of is that we have really, really narrowed the, the, the criteria for judges, you know.  You know, when I first, when I first got involved in it I mean, it was like people off the street, "Well, you go judging this and you go judging--," you know, you know what I'm saying, it's not fair to these kids.  You need people who are professors and in, in the sciences, you know.  In, in, in people like that you need filmmakers judging film, you know, when I got there they had somebody from IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] one year judging you know, we have three or four judges judging filmmaking.  Well, come on, you know, we need somebody who is in the film industry.  So I sponsor one every year to come out, you know, from our, our, our, our company [The Walt Disney Company, Burbank, California] to help judge filmmaking you know, as an example.  So, we've narrowed that and we have very competent judges now.  We judge in, in all these areas.  And we have some students who come back, you know.  This year we've had several students who were, who were there, like one guy who judged filmmaking, he came back, he's now works for Fox [Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation], you know, in, in the motion picture company there.  And he came back to judge.  And he told them that when he, he competed in, in, in the ACT-SO before and he didn't win.  So that sends a great message.  So you may not win, but keep on going, you know.  It's like look at me now.  So those are the kinds of things.  And we've, we've had astronauts to come in and judge in, in some of the, in the science categories.  And so it's just, it's, it's a good, it's a good, it's a great program and we have some very dedicated IAC members, Industry Advisory Council members.  UPS [United Parcel Service, Inc.], State Farm, McDonald's, The Walt Disney Company, are just a few that I can remember off the top of my head who, who actually belong to the Industry Advisory Council.  CBS is one of our members--
Story_ID: 304118
Speaker 1: So you see it's--been growing steadily over the years (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean, we've had to kind of limit it, you know, and, and what, what's, what happens though is a lot of you know--you hear these stories about--matter-of-fact Jackie, Jackie Holmes [Jacqueline Holmes] who is the advisor in, in the Jacksonville [Florida] area, you know, she had about maybe fifteen or twenty kids here and she said, "Bob [HistoryMaker Robert Billingslea], I almost didn't get them here."  You know, I mean, we just don't have the money to get them to the competition, you know.  And so, that, that happens frequently, you know.  And I try to support, I try to bring people out of California, out of Florida, out of my budget to, you know, fly them out there and, and let them compete, you know--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: --so those are some of the things that we, we, we have to do with ACT-SO [Afro-Academic, Cultural, Technological and Scientific Olympics] and just get the message out that, that we have not done a good marketing--we haven't done the marketing as well as we should, you know.  We've got to get a marketing campaign and let people know what it's about.  And I think once, once people see what ACT-SO is about they, they'll usually want to support it.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, I--there, there is so many, so many concerns that I have, particularly with our, our young people, you know, getting the opportunities that they need to better themselves, you know.  I wish we could eliminate the drug traffic that, that goes on.  I wish we could eliminate, you know, gangs that, that we have; black on black crime, you know, I wish we had better educational programs for, for our people, you know, it's, it's all those kind of things; it's better jobs, it's you know, it's those things that we need in the black community.  Seems like we're kind of slipping back a little bit, you know from where we, where we were.  You know, it's--I, I don't, I don't know the edge, I don't know if I have the solution to all these problems.  But, we, we got to get busy.  We, we, meaning black people got to get busy.  And we got to clean up our act in, in, in, in the communities you know.  Community has got to be a community.  You know there, there, you know, you've got to be a neighborhood, if you will, you know, more so than what's, what's happening now, you know.  It just don't have that same kind of feel I guess, when I grew up.  You know, when I can look at those people, you know because things have changed.  And, and I, I was telling that when I, when I grew up there was the janitor, there was the person who worked at, at the, the club, you know, as a bartender.  There was a person that owned the funeral, funeral home.  There was a person next door who was a lawyer.  There was the people across the street who was a principal.  There was the retail person who owned a store, you know, all lived in the community or the neighborhood.  We don't have that now, you know.  So our youngsters growing up don't see that, it's not the same.  And somehow we've got to get them to see the role models to see the people that are out there doing things, you know, that you can, you can be like, you know, if you put your mind to it.  And that's a tough one, you know, because the more, the more affluent we get we tend to move away.
Story_ID: 304120
Speaker 1: Do you see anything as being the cultural glue that would hold us together or, or whatever, or what cultural attraction would pull us together as a people (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, well I don't know whether there is any, any one, any one thing that we can do, but we've got to somehow, I guess a lot of these organizations that are out there, we, we've, we've got to sort of come together and give back.  And, and not just financially, but we've got to give back in time.  We've got to be better mentors; you know like the 100 Black Men [100 Black Men of America, Inc.] and what they are doing, you know.  We've got to get you know, the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] has got to, you know, be more involved in youth programs.  I, I understand what the mission is, but somehow they've got to get involved; the Urban Leagues [National Urban League] got to get involved.  I, I think all these organizations have somehow got to come together and say, "Well, what can we do collectively"?  You know, I mean, you know, the boule--the Kappas [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity], the Omegas [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity], the Alphas [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity], I think it takes us all to get in there and, and, and raise the child, you know.  It--it takes that village.  And I think that's what we, we all have to do, you know.  I would love to see all these organizations really, really come together, I guess, and sit down and map out a plan, you know.  And it's not their plan, or their plan, but it's our plan and what can we do, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know whether that answered your question.
Speaker 1: That's okay.
Speaker 2: That was a long way around, but--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --that's, that's what I think has got to happen, you know.  And we can't put this burden on other people.  It, it ain't other peoples problem.  It's our problem, you know.  It ain't the white man's problem.  It's our problem.  We've got to solve it.  And, and we, they've got to work with us, you know.  And, I mean, Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] made, made a great point yesterday in talking about, you know, his talk about guns.  There is not one gun shop in the black community, you know.  There is not one cocaine manufacturing shop in the black community, you know.  Or crack, so it's coming from somewhere.  It ain't--we're not manufacturing it, you know.  We don't manufacture guns.  We don't manufacture dope.  So it's coming in from somewhere and we've got to figure out a way to help stop that, you know.  And it's going to take everybody.

Speaker 1: When you look back at your life, when you look back at everything you've done up to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: Yeah, probably, probably, I think that I probably would have went on and either got a master's [degree], law degree or a Ph.D., educationally.  I think I'm sorry I didn't, I didn't do that.  By the time I got to work I started working, you know, and never took the time out to do that.  I think that's what I would, I would do, I would do differently, yeah.
Speaker 1: Likewise, when you look back over your life to this point--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --what do you see today as your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I, I think that what I have done and what I have a passion for is to help our community.  I think I've been fortunate in that I've been able to take the resources of a major, major company [The Walt Disney Company, Burbank, California] and give it back to those people who need it.  And I think if anything that's, that's what I bring to the party.  I've been able to convince our people that we've got to give back to the people and, and, in terms of jobs, but also in terms of other things that we need to do.  And I have driven that in our company and that's what I'm proud of.  I'm proud of the fact that I've been able to do that, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It ain't been easy, but I've been able to do it.

Speaker 1: Tell us about your family.
Speaker 2: Um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, now, we talked about one son that you had--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, I have one son.
Speaker 1: --and is it still just one?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my son is--matter-of-fact, my son lives in the Orlando [Florida] area and he finished, finished Florida A&M University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] and he is a, he's a probation officer, you know.  My wife [Deidre Billingslea] is my, my second wife is, of course, lives in Orlando, Florida.  She is now an entrepreneur.  She has a master's [degree] in public health administration, so she worked in public health for about fifteen years.  And then she wanted to go into the entrepreneur thing.  So she now owns three sunglass stores [Sunglass International], you know, designer sunglasses, in two airports, Tampa Airport [Tampa International Airport, Tampa, Florida] and Orlando Airport [Orlando International Airport, Orlando, Florida].  And she just now got into real estate about six months ago, so she's also doing that.  So everybody's got to work, (laughter) in the family, but that's what she's doing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there anything we haven't asked that you think we, we, we need to talk about before we ask our last question?
Speaker 2: No, I can't think of anything.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And the question is sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As a person who cared and who did something about it.
