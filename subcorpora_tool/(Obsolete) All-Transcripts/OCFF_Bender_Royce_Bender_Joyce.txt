 Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  Today is September 19, 2014. My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn. Also  with me is Tanya Finchum. We   re with the Oklahoma Oral History  Research Program at the OSU Library, and today we are interviewing  Royce and Joyce Bender as part of the Oklahoma Centennial Farm  Families Oral History Project. We   ll be talking about Bender Farms  today. Thank you so much for being with us.  Okay, good. Glad to be here, glad you   re here.  Glad we   re here, too. I   d like to start by having you tell me how your  family came to Oklahoma, came to settle that land.  Well, the four brothers left Kiowa, Kansas, in two spring wagons during  the Run, which was what, a 121 years, I think, now. Some people  thought they were sooners because they got four corners together out  there. (Laughs) Some of my aunts definitely denied that. They  homesteaded in section one and section twelve. Also, my grandmother,  her father Lewis Helmich homesteaded in section one, just across the  road from each other, and that is four and a half miles west of Cherokee.  We used to call it Fifth Street all the time, and now it   s Greer Road. It  was all tall prairie grass at the time, I think, and they went back to  Kiowa, Kansas, to get some of their lumber to build anything out of.  I think originally they had the dugout west of the buildings, and then  later they built a little one-room house way out in the middle of the  section almost. Always told me there was, oh, what do you call them?  Gypsies, or so, later in life they   d come in there and steal their chickens  or anything they could get a hold of. So they went way out, and they  didn   t farm it all with horses or mules. My granddad didn   t believe in  farming with horses, though he used mules.  And dug a hand-dug well, which I still use it. There   s four hand-dug  5  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  wells, but we still use two of them now to water our cattle with. They   re  approximately thirty feet deep and only maybe twelve feet to water  there. It was always good water. I don   t know, later on he added a nicer  home when the family got bigger. They built on sections of these houses  a lot of times. In 1918, he added on there, and they had water and a  bathtub. I have the old bathtub and lavatory out at the farm and had tile  floors in part of the house and a pantry. It   s pretty modern. In    29 and     30 a man by the name of Zenith put a gas line from Alva to Cherokee  over there, and they got to have natural gas and a Seville refrigerator  back in the    30s or so, the early    30s.  Of course, I   m old enough to remember some of the dust bowls we had  here. My granddad, after a couple of brothers died, my great-grandfather  moved here from Kansas, and he was quite wealthy, because I have  records in here. My sister kept everything, and my dad, and granddad,   and even had a  1915 Sandusky tractor. My granddad had a 1912  Cadillac and a 1915 Cadillac and he seemed to have some money. Most  all of his children are college graduates. My dad, of course, was the  oldest. Well, he had a younger sister just lived two days. She was born in     97 and my dad    98 and then on down the line.  Some of the foundation from the house was the soft rocks they hauled in  from west of Cherokee, or west of Alva out here in the hills. I heard my  granddad hauled a bunch there for the Enterprise School. You know  there   s a schoolhouse every three miles out here. Short Springs you  came by over here by Ashley standing, and they have one up here at the  museum they moved in.  I have the original copy of when he staked his claim and went to the  Land Office in Alva, original copy in there. Over here on the highway, if  you cut across the country and out here by Ampride or so, that canyon  there they said they couldn   t cross it. It was so deep they had to go down  to Salt Fork River to get into Alva.  I started mostly farming, well, drove out three of our first tractors. I ran a  thirty-three Allis-Chalmers, and we had thirty-seven and forty-one and  we got into D John Deeres and Internationals. Granddad had a J. I. Case  threshing machine and had crews, and they hauled the wheat to town  with the wagons and teams, or maybe pickups or cars pulled the wagons.  And horses at first. Yeah, a lot of history.  Let   s back up a little bit and talk about how the land progressed through  your family.  How I acquired it?  6  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  J. Bender  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  Right.   We started buying aunts and uncles out in the 1960   s.  I bought an  eighty next to  the homestead  in section twelve, and then we bought  that quarter there, and we had eighty down here in Woods county. My  dad   s aunt and uncle, in section one after my great-granddaddy died, he  willed his two daughters and my granddad land there. My granddad  bought out one of his sisters, and the other one lived in Chicago and  sued him to get that other eighty. I ended up buying the aunts and  cousins out, and then my wife started teaching school at Cherokee. We  were going to build  on the farm  but we built a new house in Cherokee   instead .  I just remember the old blacksmith   s shop as a kid. I   d go out there and  fire up the forge and hammer on stuff and played on those old tractors  and everything else. They had several. Granddad never got rid of the old  tractors, kept around at least two or three of those there, a Sandusky. I  don   t know. After I ended up getting some of that land, I had three of  those Allis-Chalmers tractors at one time, and I wasn   t into the old  tractor pulls. I had enough newer machinery that I didn   t want them, so I  sold all three of those. A lot of junk to clean up, especially on section  one there. When I acquired it, there were thirteen binders and about that  many combines, just junk you had to haul off for scrap metal, I guess.  So your grandfather William was the one who came from Kiowa to settle  the land?  Yes and his three brothers.  And his three brothers.  Four quarters.  And William had how many children?  Well, there   s five daughters   six, wasn   t it?   Seven. There were five daughters and two sons .  Yeah,  seven .  And William, was he primarily a farmer, or did he work off the farm?  Back in those days, I don   t know how they were able to keep them. Of  course, they were supposed to improve upon it in five years, but  undoubtedly they kept a brother or two there most of the time. And they  7  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  J. Bender  R. Bender  J. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  could leave. No, he went  to  Kansas and worked. He was a foreman on  a railroad for a while. He was a big man, six four or five, and back in  those days, if you probably been around the old railroad, the rails are  small, short and smaller rails. They had them tied together with pieces in  there. You probably saw in the movies where a few guys pick up these  rails and carry them. I heard one time that he could lift one of those rails,  which I don   t know, but they were big. He was a big man. I   m the runt  of the family on our side. I have a sister and another sister bigger than I  am, you know.  So, on his 160, what were some of the early structures he started  building?  Well, after they moved up towards the road, got the dugout and the well  dug there. Probably the little building there was just small, and they  probably put corn in. I remember they had a grinder out there with a  horse or mule. They went in a circle and ground their own corn. Then  they built some bigger granaries near the house up here and had a lean-to  on each side. One of them there had a little window out there and  stanchions. Inside there these old horse collars were hanging on the wall  in there until they finally fell down. Got tromped on by cattle, I guess.  Probably the first two buildings were granaries, first three buildings and  a lean-to or two to park cattle or machinery in. The next bigger building  there was   might show her that picture there of the Goofy barn we  called it later. One of my daughter-in-laws painted Goofy on the side of  it. It was built in 1916, machinery shed, and then in    24 another barn was  built, and it   s still out there. This was quite a landmark for this (gestures  to photo). On the side of that building, an ex-daughter-in-law painted  that on there (   You gotta be Goofy to be a farmer   ). Is there another  picture of that? I think there   s another one in there. Yeah, yeah, that   s  another one, but I did just tear that one down. It was getting pretty  rickety and about to fall.  That became a landmark.  Yeah, everybody     For lots of people.  What were some of the early crops William worked on?  Well, I think they grew pretty well their own corn for their cattle and  milk cows, and I   m sure they had oats and wheat. A small elevator just a  mile and half east of there. Of course, there wasn   t any Cherokee there,  so my granddad did all the banking in Ingersoll. You came through  8  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  J. Bender  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  there. There   s not much there anymore. There were a lot of saloons and  banks in Ingersoll in the old days. I think they kind of had a little  squabble between Ingersoll and Cherokee after Cherokee came in. They  got the railroads more into Cherokee, and it   s built in kind of a flood  area. It   s had a lot of flooding, a lot of problems. The post office was  there at Auburn. There   s a church and cemetery still there and a post  office at Auburn. From the farm, a five-mile corner west and first corner  and two miles south there where they did their post office. What   s more  questions?  Do you know much about William   s wife?  Other than she was Rozella Helmich, the oldest child, and when her  mother and father passed away, my granddad was appointed guardian.  They had to sell the land, and my granddad already had a couple of kids  of his own and, what, about eight of those, so they were sent to my  grandmother   s brother and sisters or put in an orphanage in Wichita   Kansas .  Which I find unusual, because they were only a few miles from the  Carmen Home and it seems like they would have gone there but they  didn   t. I   ve done quite a bit of research on the Carmen Home, and it  seems strange they went to Wichita, and yet the family seemed drawn to  Wichita more. Probably Enid was almost non-existent at that time. His  father went to university at Friends University in Wichita, and one of his  sisters went there to the hospital to become a nurse. I guess it was just  because Enid was not as developed as Wichita was at the time.  At one time there were a lot of pictures of threshing machines,  combines, tractors and everything. I don   t know, probably most of them  were taken near town where my dad lived and his younger sister. I don   t  know what happened to them all. I think she gave them all away or  didn   t know what to do with stuff. There was a fire in the house. I think  that burned a few things, too. House is still there because it didn   t burn  the house. It had a solid cement floor over the top, so it didn   t burn the  house.  Well, let   s talk a little bit about your father. Did he grow up on the  farm?  Yes.  And did he ever tell you any about any of his early chores on the farm or  what he had to do?  Well, I know when he was over there in section one running a lister and  9  duster, he had a team run away, and they went around the section back  home. The team went back home there across the road more or less, and  he walked home and got home. My grandmother looked at him, and he  had blood running out of his shoe or boot, and that lister had a disk on it  to kill the lister, and he had a pretty bad cut.  He came over to Northwestern to go to school, he thought, and the  president of the university offered him a drink. My dad was a teetotaler,  and so he went to Friends University, which the Quakers didn   t believe  too much in drinking. He finished classes at Horace Mann. Northwestern  had a high school there for a while. He got his degree at Friends  University and started teaching school in 1924 and met my mother and  got married in    24. He bought a house at 824 Church Street, that I was  born in and my older brother and sister, we believed for a twenty-dollar  bill. (Laughs) He had sold that house not very many years ago and built  a new one up on the highway and rented  the old one  out for years.  He couldn   t cash his Oklahoma Teachers warrants in 1929. The state  was broke. He banked at Central National. They wouldn   t even loan him  any money on his warrants. He went up to Alva State, and they did loan  him some money, part of it on interest, you know.  He joined the  National Guard and eventually became company commander.  And he   first  reported to the 45th Division company commander as, I think, a  first lieutenant. Then he went to Fort Mammoth Signal Corps School. He  and his brother had HAM radio operator licenses in 1918, HAM radios.  He was a math major and science, and they made and built their own  Delco Remy thirty-two volt system out at the farm and pretty well built  their own HAM radio. I heard they were able to talk to Cuba on a five-watt  unit. He was taken in in the 45th when they were activated in 1940,  but he had a wife and four kids at home,  so  they let him out. That  means you   re an officer. They pulled him back in before Pearl Harbor,  and he was home on leave when Roosevelt came on and told us about  the Pearl Harbor bombing. I was sitting there about ten years old, wasn   t  I? Nine, ten. On an old Zenith radio we heard that, and the next day we  had a telegram to report back to camp.  He was stationed mostly or for a while at Fort Bliss, Texas,  later Fort  Hood  and did go over to Germany. He was a signal supply officer. He  made captain then, retired major later. He was cleared by the FBI to  code and decode messages out of Washington.  When he was in Texas  I  got to go down there and live in the summer a time or two in the  barracks with him, and, boy, I was treated pretty nice. All these non-coms  out there would come in and see a coke machine back there and  say,    Kid, we   ll buy you a coke if you   ll go get us one.    You know? But  you couldn   t drink the water. Camp Hood, it was Camp Hood then.  1 0  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender   My dad  was chewed out by Patton once, I heard. The telephones  weren   t working, and my dad had nothing to do with the telephones. He  was strictly radios. They were good radios they had then, put the  batteries in. They didn   t work too good, either. Then I know one time  the commander over him wanted to get rid of him. I don   t know why,  but anyway, I think a full-bird colonel came in there and told him,    Let   s  take a walk down the railroad track.    They did, and the next day the  other guy was shipped out. He went over to Germany awhile at Hanau,  Germany. It was really after the war ended, though.  Sent him out on some guard duty. They had to guard all the water  supply. They were afraid that the Germans might poison the soldiers  there. I was there at Camp Hood when he was Officer of the Day, or  OD. Of course, you had to wear your forty-five, and he could set his  shoes outside his room and a black, African American, would polish his  shoes and take care of everything. Privilege of being an officer. They  were segregated then pretty well, and once they said you had to head  count all of them, and they said all these black soldiers had their heads  completely covered up even though it   s summer and it   s hot. They had  to lift the blanket off to make sure they was there, I guess. I don   t know.  It   s just some stories about my dad, I guess.  Well, when he came back from the war, did he continue teaching, or did  he move back to the farm?  No, he put in his own radio/television shop. I had some cousin in   Capron, Oklahoma  that did mechanic work there in the buildings and  still up here. My older brother and I built all the cement blocks for the  building, forty-by-sixty building, on one block mold. Then I helped  build a couple of houses for my sister and brother-in-law and my dad   s  there.  Well, what was going on on the farm during the war and after?  Well, I remember a lot of pigs and chickens. Some of the land that they  couldn   t farm at all, they rented some out to other people because you  just couldn   t   with the machinery and things you had back there, mules  before, you just couldn   t farm it all. I even broke out some of it there  because they just couldn   t farm it all until you get into the better, newer  machinery, tractors. A lot of difference from even when I started running  an old no air conditioned cab tractor and not four-wheel drive.  Yeah, I remember plowing with a little 314 plow that turned the ground  and choked up on the straw. Maybe you   d sit on the plow and try to kick  the straw out.  Now we have  four-wheel drive tractors and thirty-foot  disks and chisels. When you was using a little plow that wasn   t five-foot  1 1  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  J. Bender  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  J. Bender  big, would take you all day. I know we had a lot more help. You hired  help, and you maybe run a combine during the daytime and unhooked  the tractor and plowed at night.  I know we had one tractor that burned. They carried their gasoline out in  five-gallon or ten-gallon cream cans, a funnel, pour it in, and maybe  you   d spill it on the hot exhaust and burn something up or so. A lot of  changes.  So when you were growing up did you live on the farm, or did you live in  town?  I lived here in town, but we went to the farm about every summer and  probably from the day school  was  out clear to school start.  So as a little boy what were some of your chores on the farm when  school was out?  I didn   t do a whole lot, I suppose. (Laughs)  You walked a mile up the road to go swimming in the tank.  Yeah, and they were out there. Chub Wessels just passed away recently.  They had a big cement tank. I was kind of Mom and Dad   s pet of the  family, I guess. (Laughs) I played a lot. Later, though, we had a cow we  milked and even brought the cow in the winter to town. You could have  cows and chickens in Alva. Up until, gosh, clear into almost the   60s, we  had a cow in town. Well, I milked the cow quite a bit. We had our own  chickens, fryers. It was good to have a fresh fried chicken and corn on  the cob and mashed potatoes almost every day for dinner.  Whose job was it to kill the chicken?  My mother.  How did she do it?  With a big ol    butcher knife.  Did she have a technique?  I don   t know. She   d put it down, I think put her foot on the legs, and pull  the head up, and whack.  My mother did that differently. She would put the chicken down, and  she   d put a board over the chicken   s neck and stand on it and then just  1 2  R. Bender  J. Bender  R. Bender  Finchum  R. Bender  Finchum  R. Bender  Finchum  R. Bender  pull the head off.  That   s the way we did our rabbits. Yeah, I did a lot of hunting.  My worst one was chickens. That scared me to death when the chicken  would bounce around afterwards, you know. I   d go running away. I  couldn   t stand it.  I think my granddad was kind of the hunter of the family. Some other  stories, they were putting some fences around, the old bodark posts,  which some of those put in a hundred years ago or more than a hundred  years ago are still out there. Everything   s partition fenced, forty acres  and twenty acres. I remember a time there that we had the old stationary  hay baler, and they had the old hay rakes. I rode on the hay rake, dump  rake. Then they had their buckboards and Model Ts or Model As shoved  up there to the baler, and you   d pitch the hay and alfalfa into the baler.  Then guys would have to sit on the side there and put the wire in and tie  them. I remember dragging the bales back from the baler and trying to  stack them or putting on the wagon. Wasn   t too old. I was probably  fourth grade, nine years old when I plowed by myself on a tractor. My  father was over there in a another field, maybe cutting wheat or so.  So what year were you born?  Thirty-one.  In 1931, okay, during the Depression.  Oh, yes, I can remember the dust bowls. We were invited out to see Ken  Burns out at Panhandle State to see the original film when he was out  there and to talk to several people he interviewed there. Had a big  banquet at the time. Of course, now he   s got the Roosevelts on public  television  PBS  now, and I enjoyed watching Teddy Roosevelt.  So while your dad was in the military, what was your mother doing?  She went down to Camp Hood some, and we moved down to Fort Bliss  for a while one winter. She was pretty well keeping care of things. My  older brother and my uncle did the farming then. Of course, back then  you didn   t have antifreeze to put in the tractors and things. In the winter  if drilling wheat, you   d have to drain the radiator every night or it   d  freeze, and the next morning you had to put water back in the tractors to  keep them from freezing and breaking a block or radiator. My older  brother was old enough that he helped do a lot of the farming, which I  did some too, but not as much as my older brother.  1 3  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  J. Bender  R. Bender  J. Bender  We had pretty well stayed in Alva while he was away, managing the  farm and doing things. I know once I heard my dad put me on the train  out of Kilgore, Texas. I think I was about fourteen, sent me home, and I  could only make it to Guthrie  Oklahoma  on that train. The depot agent  telegrammed my mother, and she sent back and told the depot to find me  a room for the night. The train then came on up to Cherokee. And you  know, you had your gasoline stamps. I think she had to borrow some of  those. Maybe you blow out a tire or two, you couldn   t even buy car tires.  At school, we had our little coupons where you   d take some money or  something to help the war effort. I don   t know, just stayed at home, I  guess, and raised the kids and spanked me because I was ornery.  (Laughter)  I couldn   t tell. (Laughter)  Had a lot of yardsticks broke on me.  You   d get into quite a bit of mischief?  Oh, yeah. I was at school, fourth grade. I went out here to the sand pits  and about drowned if another kid hadn   t pulled me out. Of course later  in life, I had my Harley. Well, we have an older son. He   s a manager at  the National Fish Hatchery in Wyoming, and hunt   oh hunt, he was just  hunting last week. I think he   s got pictures out here. He   s got every  animal there is about hanging out in two different houses, from his  mountain goat to his elks and to his antelope to everything. I don   t  know.  And our younger son that farms, we had a terrible accident in April.  They put in a new eye socket and a new jawbone, and he still has to have  another surgery. They cut the top of your head open and pull your face  down and put in new eye sockets. He   s getting along fine except he  doesn   t have sight in his one eye. He   s a big boy, six four or five.  An unusual thing, I don   t know whether it had anything to do with the  genes or something about their living conditions, but of the seven  children, only the oldest two escaped cancer. Their mother had cancer,  and all of the younger ones did, too. Seems really strange, and it could  well be the genes. The oldest child and the youngest were male. The  ones in between were all women, and they all had breast cancer, except  the oldest daughter didn   t, but the others all experienced it in one way or  another.  My dad   s brother had it.  And most of them died from it, but one went ahead and had the surgery  1 4  R. Bender  Finchum  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  J. Bender  R. Bender  and had both breasts removed just to avoid having it.  Well, my Uncle Wayne had a brain tumor. Well, he wasn   t the youngest.  Ferris was the youngest.  Were they using pesticides that early that would   ve     Not anything that I know of. Two, Four-D didn   t come around until  sometime in the Vietnam era, didn   t it? There   s hardly any 2,4-D or  DDT used now. We   re using a lot of Roundup because we   re no-till  farming. One neighbor over there, been in it probably thirteen, fourteen  years. Been real successful. We   ve only been in it about four.  How did you make the decision to go to no-till?  Well, I think probably influenced a lot by  a  neighbor. If you had been  here last week or the week before, they closed Highway 64. All the dirt  was blowing so bad, two days we had last week. A no-till doesn   t wash  as bad, and dirt   s not blowing off of it. We cleaned up one twenty-some-acre  ground there it was blowing because we wanted it clean to plant  alfalfa on. The rest of it   s still left in the stubble or the straw, and it   s not  blowing. You don   t have to work as much. I hadn   t really used a tractor  until I worked that twenty-some acres up the other day. I ran a tractor.  You don   t burn near the fuel, but no-till farming isn   t cheap. It   s  expensive for your chemicals and spray.  Several neighbors have bought their own spray rigs. It isn   t the price per  acre of doing it. It   s mainly the chemicals. I think you do have to put on  a little more fertilizer to offset the residue and everything. The boy went  to several OSU plots and things where they dig down four, five feet  deep, and your earthworms are more. Soil is just more mellow. A lot of  these people, up by Burlington especially, are still using the anhydrous  ammonia, the gas, and that seems to dry the ground out more. I think it  will kill earthworms, or this just seems like where you would get stuck  before, the ground   s more mellow and yet it soaks the water in better.  What about the cost of equipment?  You have  less  equipment  now , a tractor and a wheat drill, and you  contract or own a combine  and  truck. Whereas in the   40s, you were  having to buy plow shears or disk blades or more bearings. It kind of  offsets. I don   t know.  But you pay for it in the fertilizer and the things that they   re using.  Yeah, it   s different. Different ball of wax, you might say. I kind of miss,  1 5  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  maybe, going out there and running a tractor some, but then on the other  hand you have time to do other things, which I should be building some  fence. (Laughs) Now with our things that we   ve got right now, there   s  pipelines all over the country. I hope they   ve got all those mapped out.  Meant to say, on that back there in 1918, which is still at the farm, have  an old Delco Remy generator with a single motor on it out of  Hutchinson, Kansas, that they furnished electricity with. The light  switches were push buttons with a brass deal around it in the old house. I  think somebody come down from Wichita and put the wiring in for that.  Had their wind charger, generator. I think they made those out of some  old Dodge starter generators combined. My dad   s 1915 Dodge car had a  big old starter generator on it, run off the timing gears or timing chain up  front. They took those and carved out their own propellers, put up their  own tower. Had settling welder and foot, welded that tower out of brass  rods instead of steel.  That gas line was put in there. I don   t know whether they didn   t have  any ark welders then, but it was all  acetylene and oxygen  piping. Then  in expansion joints, they had a piece over that and rubber seals on that  every so often. I dug up some of that pipe, that Zenith. They gave us the  pipe. For a dollar you could have all the pipe back. Surprising how good  that pipe was. They went from west of Cherokee five-mile road, put a T  into Carmen, and now west of Cherokee one mile feeds up to, I think it  goes to Burlington now. They   re still using it, but the rest of it got so  many leaks on it they took it out after we moved to Cherokee. In the    70s there, they took that gas line out.  When did they start drilling on your land?  Oil?  Yes.  Actually, she   s got a well out west of Burlington, and all the rest we  have over here, they   re on the neighbors. (Laughs)  Was it in your father   s time or grandfather   s time, or has it only been  recent?  No, this is just the last few years really. We   ve really got a boom here.  It looks like it when you   re driving in this area. So what have been some  of the positives and negatives of this?  Well, there   s more crime.  1 6  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  J. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  J. Bender  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  J. Bender  R. Bender  Okay.  More accidents up here on the highway. A semi driver ran into an old  gentleman, ninety years old, sitting in his living room, and a semi ran in  there and killed him. Every day you read maybe a truck turned over or a  wreck, a semi. And look at the Alva paper and everything, help-wanted  ads. You can   t hire any help because everyone   s gone to the oil field,  begging for truck drivers. The only place that   s worse, I guess, is up  there in the Dakotas.  You probably saw, just as you were coming out from Alva, that just in  this mile, all of the mobile homes there.  Yes.  East of Alva.  That   s an oil camp.  All the big tanks set up, south of Cherokee, east of Alva, oil tanks. The  trucks the other day, I counted twelve trucks in a row. These gravel  trucks are graveling a lot of the country roads. It   s to get to the well  sites.  Have you felt any earthquakes?  Not here. I can remember one years and years ago, but they   re mainly  around Medford and Enid. They   re smalls, maybe four at the most. I  don   t know.  I think this part of Oklahoma is very special because of the Salt Plains  and the environment. Have you noticed any changes with the  environment with this rise in drilling?  Traffic.  Do you see as many birds?  Birds? Oh, well, they   re out here eating on this food. (Laughter)  There was a squirrel hanging on our birdfeeder right before you came.  This area right here is just full of squirrels, but they all seem to find our  birdfeeder. Drives the little dog nuts.  No, Alva is really built up. Just go south there on 281, the oil people     1 7  J. Bender  R. Bender  J. Bender  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  Well, on 64 that you came in, those three motels are all new. You  couldn   t get a room there if you wanted it, on a weekend maybe, but  otherwise they   re all booked by the oil people.  I don   t even know if they opened that little one yet. The other two, that   s  just essentially oil wealth.  The third one may not be open yet, but she   s already building another  one. She told the mayor, at least, that she could pay for it in four years.  The one in Cherokee, that lady has it. She   s leased it out by the year to  Sandridge, whole thing.  Thinking about your farm land, how have your neighbors changed  through the years?  Well, there   s less of them. Used to be a farmhouse on every quarter,  schoolhouse every three miles, and everybody had from six to ten kids  or more or less. They   ve all got bigger or either sold out or something.  Used to be, maybe, you made your living on one quarter or two. We  don   t have a lot, 880 acres that we own, and our boys own another 400  and some. But then, we rent a little bit. All these guys, they have from  three to four thousand acres around here.  With the land itself, wasn   t too long ago we thought a thousand dollars  an acre was expensive and you got the minerals with it. Now you can   t  even buy the minerals. The oil companies are even offering three or four  thousand dollars an acre just for the minerals. To go way back with my  granddad back in the    20s, I don   t know whether he was scammed or  what, but he sold half the minerals on two or three quarters over there  for a dollar an acre. I just leased them here a while back for  2,100 or   2,150, I think, an acre. We leased them and kept the minerals.  That   s the difference in the price of land up in here now, gone from a  thousand to three or four thousand dollars an acre. In fact, we just  bought an eighty over there, and what was it? Over two thousand dollars  an acre. It   s the roughest piece of ground I got, but it   s next to me. You  get two people betting on something like two old bucks, but I wanted it  because I already owned the two quarters and an eighty in that section  where this farm is, so I just added another eighty to it. The oil money, I  just wrote them out a check for it, anyway. It was a hundred sixty or  seventy thousand or something. So I don   t know.  Were you eyeing that particular piece of land because it touched up  against land you already owned?  1 8  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  J. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  Well, I kind of wanted it. Years ago I offered a hundred and twenty  thousand for it, for the whole quarter, and I gave twice that almost for an  eighth and didn   t get the minerals either. Well, not really. I really wanted  across the street in section one that my cousins owned because I owned  it one time when I bought this aunt and cousins out. I owned it. Had  seven kids, and I owned six-sevenths of it. I probably would   ve got it  except for one aunt gave her share to my uncle. When I bought all of this  place and that eighty, I had to do some swapping with my uncle to get  him off the quarter. He kept the eighty next to him is how I got some of  that land. We just traded land.  Well, I thought your farm story   s interesting because you actually went  out and tried to purchase everything once again and bring it all back  into the family. Is that correct? Was it hard dealing with your relatives  trying to get everything back to one owner?  Well, my dad started out buying his youngest sister out first, and some  of the cousins there didn   t want an exchange of money to show on taxes,  so I bought some land in Kansas and then just switched that way. That  land, I   ve never seen it or anything else. Don   t even know where it is.  They sent a legal down, and I bought that, and they signed the papers for  mine. Of course, I had to make out the check to those people, which I  said I   d never seen them.  Was it important for you to do this? What was motivating you to get it  all?  Well, one time as a kid I always said I wanted to own those four quarters  that my granddad and his brothers homesteaded. The one, his wife left  him, Frank Bender, next to mine, his wife left him, and after he passed  away, she sold it. My granddad just every way in the world tried to buy  it, but she wouldn   t sell it to him, so Sanders bought it. Then my dad   s  uncle and aunt bought it over there, and after on in the family here, my  dad and my aunt inherited some. I was able to buy some then, more of it.  So, like I say, where this farm is, I own one, two, three quarters right  there in that section.  Well, you   ve seen lots of changes through the years, and I   m sure it   s  even complicated now how you handle your bookkeeping. Do you have  any idea of how it was handled during your father   s time or your  grandfather   s time until today?  He kept everything.  He kept everything.  1 9  J. Bender  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  J. Bender  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  We   ve got a safe out in the garage that was the safe that was there on the  original farm. When his dad started the shop in Alva, then he moved it  there, but we have it out here now.  Nobody threw away anything. I got a barrel out there now that   s got  checks dated 1900, so many checks, a dollar and a half, two dollars,  even a house add-on. I think eighteen hundred dollars    worth of material  practically built that part of the house. Things were so cheap. There   s  file drawers in here. I can show you papers from all sides of the family  from one grandparent from Frankfurt am Main  Germany , another one  from Bremerhaven  Germany . My own mother didn   t even know  English when she started school. She had two younger sisters buried  over in Russia, Prussia. I have file drawers. My sister was a DAR,   Daughters of the  American Revolution. One, I know, was in the Civil  War and was taken prisoner and escaped. I   m not sure, but Joe Bender, I  think, when he made the Run he only had one leg, one of the brothers.  And they were in the Chicago Fire, my great-grandfather. They were  supposed to have dug a deep hole and put their belongings in, and then  some friend or neighbor come along, and they uncovered some of that  and put theirs in it. Then they didn   t have enough dirt on the top of it,  and so they still lost everything. They worked for the Schuttler Wagon  Wheel Company. I have some, out here in the safe, little trinkets that  Peter Bender   s supposed to have made. The Bender name is supposed to  come from Germany. They put the steel band around the wagon wheel,  the bender. Bender, you wouldn   t think was too much German, but I  have papers in here. There   s thousands of Benders in Germany. My  mother   s name was Goenger, which is German or early German, Prussia,  Russia. There   s a lot of German people.  How did she meet your father?  She meet my father? Well, one of her brothers worked there for my  granddad for a lot of years, and she went to school over there at  Enterprise, six west of Cherokee. Probably, I don   t know.  I   d expect they were going to the same school.  Well, they did go to the same school, grade school. Although records I  have in here, I think my dad was already out of there when my mother  was going there, four years difference.  How many brothers and sisters do you have?  A brother and sister   s deceased, and one sister living, younger sister.  2 0  Finchum  R. Bender  J. Bender  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  J. Bender  R. Bender  Finchum  R. Bender  J. Bender  R. Bender  Finchum  R. Bender  Four of us.  Was church a very important part of your upbringing?  It definitely was. My mother and father, she was really a Lutheran, and  after she married my dad, joined the Friends Church. My dad, like I said,  was a teetotaler and claimed he never smoked a cigarette in his life or  drank. I don   t know. My granddad, I think he ended up being a diabetic.  I never did talk or ask anybody about that, but I heard he always kept a  jug with cold water pumping on it out of the windmill. So I don   t know.  I think he had severe arthritis, too. That might have been part of the  reason for the wine in the cooler.  Well, I made a mistake out there when I buried three different storm  shelters, caves. I built a barn right over the top and didn   t have it settled  good, and my floors sunk in there some. (Laughs) Yeah.  Well, through the years what other structures have been added to the  property? We talked about some of the early ones.  Well, in    81, I built a Butler building and, what was it, a couple years  ago, where this Goofy barn, right near it, I put up a fifty-by-eighty open  barn, machinery shed. That one barn is still there from 1924, and the rest  of those and the house, I tore down.  There   s just two buildings (they show up in the picture of the house) that  are still there. Not worth anything, but     In section one, there   s still an old barn with the old woodwork and  board, and it was moved in there, I think, in 1912 or so.  A butler building, what is that?  That   s just the brand name.  The name of the person building it.  Like the other building we have is a Star building. It   s just a galvanized  barn. That   s just the brand name.  Well, has farming been your way of life, or have you had other  employment?  I worked on the railroad awhile, about two years at Boeing, and spent  my eighteen months overseas, there in the Korean War. Basically ever  2 1  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  J. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  J. Bender  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  J. Bender  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  J. Bender  R. Bender  J. Bender  since about    58, I   ve done it pretty well I guess. We did run a shop in  Alva. My military was mechanic, anyway, and pretty well used to try to  do all our own repairs and welding and everything, but too old for it  anymore.  Well, in your adult life after you came back from the war, did you ever  live on the farm as an adult, or did you always live in town?  Pretty well always lived in town.  Always lived in town.  Except, like I say, through the wheat drilling time, we stayed there.  When I started teaching in Cherokee, we thought about putting a trailer  out there because the house was already either gone or not worth living  in. It was August, and the wind was blowing off of those plowed fields,  and the dust was coming. I said,    Let   s live in town.    (Laughter) I grew  up on a farm, but I didn   t like it, ever.  Well, how did you two meet?  I was a car hop at A W Root Beer. Didn   t wear roller skates.  And a few years younger.  Did he have a nice car, at least?  Well, I had a brand new    54     It was okay.     Ford, traded it in and got an   88 Oldsmobile then. Our first car we  bought after we was married was a    62 Ford for thirty-two hundred  dollars.  So you weren   t typically drawn to the farm because you grew up on a  farm. Did you help out, once you were married, on the farm?  No.  Once. We were wanting to go on vacation, and so     Did some field plowing.     he started the plowing and put me on the tractor. I   d go around, and  2 2  R. Bender  J. Bender  R. Bender  J. Bender  R. Bender  J. Bender  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  J. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  every round I made it was beginning to lean and tilt a little bit more. I  was getting really worried about that, so I cut the field in half and made  twice as many corners for him to have to work out, and he never asked  me to do that again.  And the dust, it   s this 930 Case or 1030 Case. I had two of them. Every  round she   d make, she   d put a mark over here (gestures) and    That   s my  round.    (Laughter) Then you had a little mouse or something in the  furrow.  There was a little mouse running along in front of me. I just couldn   t run  over that mouse, so I stopped the tractor and had to go through the, you  know,    How do I get this started again?    Stopped it, and about that time  a hawk came down and swooped up that mouse and flew away with it.  (Laughs) So that was wasted effort. No, I do not like farming. I drove a  truck a few times, too.  Busted an axle and about run me over. (Laughs)  Not my thing to do.  Oh, the hay baling, when you picked up hay bales, little bales.  I threw him off the bale wagon.  You run over a few, too. (Laughter) Tossing the bales on a truck, you  know, the old-time ways. Now everything   s done with hydraulic front-end  loaders. You don   t handle anything by hand much anymore. Then  they had those automatic    you haul    em    wagons.  And how many kids do you have?  Two.  Two kids.  Two boys.  And did they help out on the farm when they were younger?  Oh yeah, yeah. They ran a combine or a tractor, yeah, quite good. The  older boy is a manager at the National Fish Hatchery. He was an Eagle  Scout, and he was a park ranger at the Columbia River Basin. Then he  got into several Bryant and Durant fish hatcheries. Jones Hole, Utah, up  there in Vernal, Utah, up near Roosevelt. Snow   s deep, but yeah.  2 3  J. Bender  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  J. Bender  R. Bender  J. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  J. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  Now he   s in Saratoga, Wyoming.  Good workers, good mechanics, at least the older one. He had his  Toyota cars fixed up, rock climbing with the cars out there at Moab   Utah , everywhere.  And your other son is farming?  He   s full-time farming.  As a fourth generation.  He did live  near Burlington . It   s three miles west of Burlington, on a  half section there. Then he bought a house about a year or so ago in  Cherokee.  But they have only a girl, so this is probably the end of the Bender  Farms.  The other boy, his wife has two boys, but they   re     When she brought the boys out, they got to ride the combine, and she  was really excited about it because her father had grown up on a farm.  But they won   t be doing that, I   m sure.  Well, as a family, have you talked about what will happen to the farm in  the future? Have you made those decisions looking into the next one  hundred years?  We have a trust account, and it will go to our boys. If something  happens to both of those, then it   ll probably go to foundations or  whatever. It   ll all be dissolved, I   m sure.  I turned my dad   s farms over to them when he died, just skipped a  generation. I don   t think it meant a great deal of difference in taxes.  In a perfect world, what would you like to see happen in the next  hundred years to the farm? In a perfect world. (Laughter)  I think it   s going to be un-perfect.  You worked so hard to put all of the pieces back together. What would  you like to see happen?  Well, I wish we did have some grandsons that could take it on and keep  it in the family yet, but we don   t, and we   re not the only ones. I could  2 4  J. Bender  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  J. Bender  R. Bender  J. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  J. Bender  R. Bender  J. Bender  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  name several of my neighbors over there in the same deal. The  McMurtrys had four. Four of the McMurtry brothers had farms, and  some of that   s still in the family, but they won   t have another generation  because the only son     Well, and there   s Curtis.  Well, yes, but not by the McMurtry name. I don   t know. Probably all of  it   ll be sold. Somebody will farm it and have it.  It   s a challenge facing a lot of our farm families.  If the Chinese don   t take us over or who all else.  I guess we   ll     What do you call them over there now? Isaacs or something?  ISIS.  Oh, ISIS, yes.  Always happy to take the money, but on the other hand, I can   t believe  that the fracking is doing the world any good. Who knows. There are  more earthquakes and close around here all the time, so     Yeah, if you   d told me        I have to think there   s some kind of connection.     told me five years ago what we have now, I   d never believed it.  Have you worked much with your cooperative extension agent?  Nope. (Laughter)  Where do you go for advice or to learn new farming techniques or     Well, read all the farm magazines for a lot of things. OSU has all kinds  of test plots, and either Kenny Fields or the McMurtrys out here, and  they all have their test plots for soybeans or milo. The boys went to one  here a while back with the milo. Of course, sometimes you disagree with  those OSU people. (Laughs) They bring their little four-foot combine up  here and cut their wheat field, and little four-foot drill and drill it every  fall. McMurtry over here he is a OSU graduate. In fact, his mother and  dad and grandfather on his wife   s side, they were several of them OSU  2 5  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  J. Bender  R. Bender  J. Bender  R. Bender  J. Bender  R. Bender  graduates there, and he is.  His nephew, they set him up in farming here recently and all this oil  money and told him,    You   ve got to go to college.    Well, he lasted  about one year or one semester at Northwestern, but he   s still set up big.  His dad is a CPA, and he had a good business at Cherokee. Now he   s got  all Colorado Springs and Denver dentists. He   s got a home in Arizona  and everywhere else. It   s just a poor kid over there who lost his mom  and dad and was one of your students. He   s a good accountant, but he   s  got money.  Was your mom or grandma involved in home demonstration clubs?  I only knew one grandmother. Almost all my grandparents were  deceased before   well, my granddad died in    33 and another one about     36. My mother   s mother was really the only grandmother I ever knew.  Did your mom do any quilting?  She was in Eastern Star for a while. I don   t know. It seems like too busy  on a lot of things. People took you (Joyce) to join all the clubs after you  got out of school.  Were your kids involved with 4-H or FFA  Future Farmers of  America ?  FFA, the younger boy was. The older boy was, like I said, an Eagle  Scout. He did a lot of scouting.  He was also the Student Conservationist Association  and spent two  summers with them  and had lots and lots of good opportunities come  from that.  Yeah, he went to     Good training, too. They went        Yellowstone one summer and then New Mexico.      out, and they   d work on the trails out there. Every ten days, you  would be the cook. You got to take a shower if you were the cook. That  day you   d stay in camp, and you could take a shower.  One year he was in Yellowstone, and they made a little swinging bridge  of some kind to get across the river there. He was the youngest and  smallest, so he got to try the bridge out, I guess.  2 6  J. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  Probably the most daring, too.  Would you do any type of conservation work on the farm, any terracing?  We probably built some terraces there in 1949. Of course, on this section  one, I put in a nice waterway and a few terraces there. Ended up making  one or two of them by myself. Those first ones were in    49. They put  them too close together for our newer machinery where you can   t even  turn around, and some of them now need about every other one taken  out. I remember the little ditches washed out those hills on that, and it   s  definitely improved the farm. A lot of that topsoil would be off it if it  wouldn   t be terraced.  Has the farm ever seen tough times? I think about the 1980s, and we  spoke a little bit about the Great Depression.  Well, I   m sure in the dirty    30s there were tough times.  Was there ever a point where you thought you were going to lose the  farm?  Not ourselves. I don   t think, well, I know in    24, my dad bought one  there in section ten, and I think he was struggling then to make his  payments, probably why he joined the National Guard. Yeah, the    80s,  the oil boom hit here and went down. Some of those farms were  bringing big money we thought then, but then nothing like it is now. We  didn   t ever think we was ever going to lose anything. Pretty well kept  the machinery up and things.  Of course now, the last new tractor I bought was a 930 Case in about  1965 or so. I   ve owned a lot of tractors since then, one four-wheel drive.  I just bought two tractors here in the last year. They   re used. Everything  I   ve bought has been used. I haven   t bought a new tractor since back in  the    60s. You know, some of these combines and tractors now, we  bought a MacDon   s thirty-five foot draper header a year or so ago, made  in Canada, and that   s seventy-seven thousand they start as a header. I  bought a used combine for a hundred and eighteen. Before we got our  wheat cut that summer, shelled the engine out, burned that side of the  block. Twenty-four thousand just to put an engine in it. Things are so  different. Combines and tractors are three hundred thousand, or that one  tractor I bought new might have been fifty-five hundred, but you didn   t  have a cab,  but you had  the dirt and heat. Yeah, time   s has changed. I  wouldn   t run one anymore without an air conditioner cab, I know that.  Well, on the farm today, what   s a typical day like for you? Or are you  2 7  R. Bender  J. Bender  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  J. Bender  R. Bender  just enjoying retirement?  Oh, I went out yesterday. Took a neighbor kid down there to Carmen to  drive our semi back. They were cutting milo, and I go out and maybe  check the cattle, water, and drive my pickup around more than anything.  I think I   m not doing a lot. Sitting there, like I said.  This summer, he   s done more because of Todd   s accident.  Yeah, I check the cattle there quite a bit this summer, and we had to sell  some because the dry conditions here. We were running out of hay and  could even buy hay hardly a year ago, but with the rain we   ve had now,  the grass is plentiful. Yeah, for some hay, you   ve only got fifteen bales  off a little patch. Alfalfa, and after first cutting you   ve got fifty-something  bales where you only got eighteen, twenty bales last year.  Wanted to plant more, but the cattle problem after his accident where he  went ahead and sold about, oh, I don   t know, about twenty-five, twenty-six  cows.  We   ve got one out there now with foot rot that needs to be sold, and  we   ve got all the calves. You   ve got some of them penned up, weaning  them, and need to work them and do the rest of them, but I don   t know if  I   m going to help him yet. I told him to hire some help. They need to  give them their shots, get branded, and what have you. They need to get  them off the cows so the cows will do better, instead of giving all their  milk to the calves. Calf gets four or five hundred pounds, they need to be  off the cow. (Laughs)  Do you have a family brand?  Yeah, it   s    BF.    It   s not registered, but it   s what we   re using, and these  cousins on that other quarter and eighty after I got Bender Farms. It   s  even in the historical building there in Oklahoma City. Isn   t that the  historical building down there on Eighty-First?  The History Center     And then after we got that in the plaque in there signed by one of the  governors in    93, my cousins after 2000, they went ahead and put  Bender Farms on everything. You can see on the map they had Bender  Farms, and I tried to tell them. I guess they   ve got it, too, that I had that  first. All girls. Well, one boy. They hadn   t lived there. My uncle started  farming in Colorado for another uncle, and they moved out there in    52.  Left that farm and everything abandoned, and there I farmed it some for  them a time or two. Now it   s all sold, anyway, so it won   t have that  Bender Farms on all that abstracts and elevator and everything, I don   t  2 8  Finchum  R. Bender  Finchum  R. Bender  J. Bender  R. Bender  Finchum  R. Bender  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  know.  So today, there   s cattle, wheat     Milo     Milo.     a little alfalfa. We used to grow a lot of barley and oats.  Soybeans, sometimes.  Well, canola, and we have soybeans out on two quarters right now.  Milo, that   s good, Four miles to town in a semi, eleven hundred bushel  on it or so. You   d have the combine bed full before the truck would get  back. About a three-hundred-bushel bed on the combine. Neighbors over  there had two John Deere combines, one of the latest 680 or so and the  other 9770 or something. Two semis and a thousand-bushel grain cart,  and trucks couldn   t keep up with the combines. You   d get a hundred  bushel of milo. I   ve never had that in my life before. It   s a ideal year.  We had some up there last year that made eighty-some. That was really  good as dry as it was. They just had the rains at the right times, though.  Wouldn   t have believed it. I had a John Deere here, and they said  somebody in the old quarter made 110 bushel of milo, which something  needs to make up because we didn   t have a wheat crop this year, very,  very little wheat. I got seed wheat. (Laughs)  So it   s important to diversify with your crops?  Well, we   re doing it, but no-till you almost have to. This one neighbor  cover crops, and they plant their radishes and beets and feed, and turn  cattle in on it for winter wheat pasture. I don   t know how people   s going  to buy their cattle this winter. Seven-hundred-pound steer sold might  bring fifteen hundred dollars now. If your meat is high, cattle is high.  Back there in the    30s, you know, the government would come out and  give you five dollars for your cow and shoot her or something. One of  my uncles told me he herded cows on the side of the road ditch, and the  federal people pulled up there and wanted to shoot his cows,    Give you  five dollars for them.    He said,    You better shoot me first.     Has crop insurance had an impact on y   all?  Oh, you better believe it. That   s the only thing we   ve made any money  from this on, but it isn   t cheap, either. Four years ago, a lot of years we  didn   t even take it. The first time I collected it was when I completely  hailed out, and the last time or two here it   s been the dry weather, the  2 9  Nykolaiszyn  R. Bender  Finchum  R. Bender  J. Bender  R. Bender  J. Bender  R. Bender  Finchum  drought. Things have changed, and we won   t get any more of your  government payments. I think they   d probably just as well close the  farm service agencies. We still have to go in and report your crops and  turn in your crop insurance and, of course, the thing when they send you  a check and they take the premium out before you get your money,  anyway. It isn   t cheap. It   s probably going to get higher. I don   t know  what you   d   a lot of the people, it   s all they depend on is raising  something. I have a neighbor or two over there on some school land.  They hadn   t farmed very good. I think that   s all they   ve been living on is  their insurance off of it. I don   t know what you   re supposed to do.  Well, what have we missed? Anything else you want to tell us?  I don   t know.  Is there a family plot where grandparents and great-grandparents are  buried here in the county?  My parents are buried up there in Alva Cemetery. My great-grandparents  and grandparents are in Cherokee Cemetery.  And they were moved.  My great-grandparents off of section one were moved over there.  Into a cemetery later. His dad told the story of going to dig them up and  I guess looking to make sure that that was who it was and that, I think,  he said that the bodies were still well-preserved.  One wooden casket had fell in, but the other one was good. I didn   t  know it, but my dad   s younger sister, Shirley Bender, born in    97. I said  something to a bunch of my cousins. They didn   t even know. The only  reason I found out was because I found a little tombstone out there at the  farm. She might   ve just been buried on the farm. I inquired about it, and  my dad said that was his sister born before he was, lived two days. W. J.  Bender and Frank Bender   s the only two that had children, and his wife  went back. Frank Bender   s wife went back to Greensburg, Kansas, and  had Edward Bender and didn   t have any contact with my dad. My dad  didn   t have any contact with his first cousin there for probably from  whenever he was born, both of them in 1898 and 1905 or something,  probably up until the    60s. Divorced and that far away, didn   t even know  they existed, I guess.  Well, what   s your favorite time on the farm, season-wise or time of day  or what? Your favorite time.  3 0  R.

Back in    71, I had twenty-four-inch snow here with  seventy-mile-an-hour wind. They closed school up here for two weeks  or more, and the shelves were cleaned out at the grocery stores. The only  way you got around there for a while was on a tractor. I drove a tractor  to Cherokee, an open cab tractor. We started that snow on Friday and  didn   t get out of the house until Monday. Yeah, we had some snows a  time or two.  Your dad had cattle out west of Burlington there, had probably sixty  head or so of his own, and electric fences and things. The cattle we had,  ended up having over two hundred head in this corral we were feeding,  and by Wednesday he and I went out there and sorted all the neighbor   s  cattle out of his and told his neighbors to get their cattle. He wasn   t  going to feed them anymore. So, it   s yeah, when you walk around in  manure this deep    (Laughs) I was younger.  So when you want a steak, you go get a fresh one?  Well, we really hadn   t fed out a calf and butchered. Now, the boy did  this winter. In fact, we   ve got all his hamburger out here in this freezer  because he didn   t have room for it, but we really haven   t butchered one.  I don   t like to cook that much. (Laughs)  We used to have some good steaks.  Well, good memories. We appreciate you sharing a little bit about your  family and telling us about Bender Farms. Thank you so much.  Thank you.  -------  -------
