 Gill. The date is March 9, 2009. I   m visiting with Dr.  Earl Mitchell here in the OSU Library in the Angie Debo Room on the  campus of Oklahoma State University. This interview is for the O-STATE  Stories Project of the Oklahoma Oral History Research  Program. Dr. Mitchell, I appreciate you being with us this morning,  taking the time to visit with us. I want to start off at the beginning. So my  first question is can you tell me a little bit about your early life? About  your family and where you grew up?  Yes, Jerry. I grew up in New Orleans. I   m one of what you call the Lost  Generation because I was born right before World War II, so I was a  baby in the beginning of World War II. Young enough that I still  remember, I was three years old when Pearl Harbor was bombed and I  still remember those days. My father spent a little time in the military,  but he worked for the Army Air Corps during World War II in the early  part before he went to the Navy. Now, essentially my dad was a Navy  man but he spent the whole war in Nebraska. (Laughter) He was drafted  towards the end because he was a guy with seven children and went to  the Navy. He got to be a Chief Petty Officer, an acting Chief Petty  Officer at that time.  But I grew up in New Orleans in the projects, public housing. I spent the  first 13 years of my life living in public housing. Mainly because with  seven children that   s the only thing my dad could afford. So in the    40s  and    50s I grew up in New Orleans in public housing. It was quite  different in those days because, remember it was very segregated during  those days and so we had public housing for both white and black. I  grew up in the area called the Calliope Project Area which is also where  I went to high school. So I pretty much grew up in that part of New  Orleans which is close to  the  inner city, about 12 blocks from  downtown Canal Street, in that area.  6  But it was an exciting time for me as a kid growing up in New Orleans  because I had all the best of the worlds because my family was very  close around. My grandmother and aunt lived about 12 blocks away so  we could walk to their house on Sunday. And like most kids during that  time, you had relatives and family close around. I had cousins who lived  around the corner from me, about half a block away, and they were the  same age. I had cousins who were close to my same age. So there were  the five Mitchell boys as we ran through the neighborhood. We were  kind of a little gang by ourselves, which maybe was good because it was  protection from all. The other kids (laughs) didn   t mess with a Mitchell  boy. But I was the one who was, I would consider myself being the calm  one. I had a cousin, Joe, who was the rough one and Joe was kind of the  leader.  But something happened when I was 12 years old. Joe died from  swimming in the Mississippi River. It was a very traumatic experience  for us because Joe was the oldest Mitchell boy and when he died that  made me the oldest Mitchell boy and it   s been that way ever since. I   ve  been the oldest in the family  of  seven children. In terms of cousins     and most of the cousins on my father   s side of the family, I have only  one who   s still living today and survived. I had three cousins who died  in the    40s and    50s and they all died before 20 years old. Two from  illnesses and one from the accident. Joe was the one that really impacted  me quite strongly because he was a leader, a very good athlete, and kind  of a good leader. We looked up to Joe as our leader.  But growing up in New Orleans during that time, I went to school, I  walked to school in the neighborhood. Those were days when you saw  the kids   we lived in a mixed neighborhood, so people don   t realize  New Orleans you had a lot of mixtures of whites and blacks in the same  neighborhood but going to different schools. The white kids would be  bussed out to go to the white schools from the neighborhood. And we  had friends across the street, we had mostly Irish-Americans and we  lived close to a place, it was the Irish Channel of New Orleans. So the  blacks and the Irish lived pretty close together. We had a policeman  across the street that lived in the neighborhood. He was a white Irish  policeman. His boys, I remember Mickey and Donald, we played with  them. They went to school and went their way during the daytime and in  the weekends we played together.  But then eventually things changed over the years where the whites  moved out and the affluent blacks moved out because in those days in  the project, you had a mixture of people live in the projects. We had a  large number of us who were, I   d say, middle-class in terms of thinking,  but you also had some people who were in one sense low  socioeconomic. We were too, but we didn   t know we were poor  7  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  (Laughs) because everybody was in the same boat. But  my  family was  a really good part in those days, growing up in New Orleans.  Earl, in your immediate family, how many brothers and sisters did you  have?  I have three brothers and three sisters. I   m the oldest of seven. My  mother had seven kids and I was the oldest at six years old. So she had a  lot of kids to take care of at one time. And my brothers and sisters were  all college graduates, three of us are Ph.D. chemists and one who  couldn   t do chemistry, he only could do math. And so he went to work  for the federal government as a GAO  Government Accounting Office   accountant and now he   s teaching math at a small college in Dallas,  Texas.  Earl, your dad, what did he do after the war?  After the war my dad became an employee of the federal government.  He was a postal clerk. A postal clerk at night. My dad had three jobs.  The only time I saw my dad he was either coming down the stairs from  the bedroom going to work or sleeping. Because he worked at post  office from 5:00pm to 2:30am, he would come home and get up at 9 and  go to work because he worked for an insurance company. He collected  insurance. In those days, people didn   t pay their insurance; people came  around and collected weekly. So he was an insurance collector. Then he  became a claim adjuster, but he did that for a long time. I remember my  dad had at least two jobs, sometimes three jobs the whole time. My  mother never worked outside the home. And the reason for that is  because my dad would not allow her to work outside the home because  the only job she could get as a high school graduate (even though she  was quite literate) was  as  a domestic. My dad would not have his wife  being a domestic for anybody else. That was his, and he made that very  clear.    She   s not going to clean anybody   s house. She   s going to clean  her own house.    (Laughs) Those were his words.  Where did the emphasis for education in your family come from? You  said three of you are Ph.D. chemists and one is in math. Phenomenal.  And the sisters all  have  degrees. Two  are  retired public school  teachers now. Well, this came primarily from my dad and mom. One of  the things we had around the house all the time was books. We had  books. We took the newspaper every day. Had two newspapers: the  morning paper and the evening paper. I remember we took the Times-  Picayune and the New Orleans States-Item, a daily paper. We also had  the black papers coming to the house. Because as a little kid, as a little  boy, my cousin Joe and I, we sold the Louisiana Weekly and the  8  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  Pittsburgh Courier. We sold papers on the corner. We always had things  to read around the house. One of the things I remember very strongly in  those days, we went to many kids    homes and you couldn   t find a thing  to read in the house. No paper, no newspaper. No books, nothing. But  we had books around all the time and it was important. My dad wanted  to go to college, but couldn   t go. He   s a Depression kid. So he had to  work very early because his father believed in hard work. My  grandfather on my dad   s side was very hard working. Contrary, on my  mother   s side, her father was a preacher who actually had a college  degree from Rust College in Holly Springs, Mississippi. He was a  teacher who decided to become a preacher, because people took care of  preachers better than they took care of teachers. (Laughs)  What was his denomination?  Baptist. He was a Baptist and my dad was a Methodist, and joined the  Methodist Church, so I grew up as a Bapto-Methodist. (Laughter) But  Methodist was a strong part of our family.  Earl, in addition to education, are there other values you learned from  your parents, experiences growing up that helped mold and shape your  life?  Yes, I guess my dad had a lot of pride. He was a very proud man. And  he also pushed excellence. That was his strong thing. We used to have  an interesting story about how Dad told us he wanted bragging material.  Bragging material meant good grades. (Laughter) I do the same thing  with my kids. I say,    Bring me some bragging material.    So he said,     Bring me some good grades, bragging material.    Because my dad  worked with a lot of people who were college graduates and he never  could go and he just wanted to show that his kids were smart and they  could do well. And my dad would   ve, I think, had the ability to go to  college. He tried to go to college on the G.I. Bill after World War II, but  working two jobs, it was impossible for him to go to school, just  impossible. And so I think the fact that he could not go, he wanted to be  sure his kids  went .  My mother was also instrumental. My mother really pushed my sisters  very strongly about education because she thought,    Well, you girls  need to learn to be independent.    See my mother had a concern, all her  life she wanted to be more than just a housewife. But knowing how  noble that was at the time, because she felt she could   ve done other  things professionally. She wanted her girls to have that independence, to  get a degree so they could be independent and be professional. And my  sisters tell me that. Now, I didn   t know my mother was doing that to the  girls, but my sisters told me that many years later. Mother had told them  9  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  they needed to go to college, get a degree, because they needed to have  something that they could fall back on.  Were you enrolled at Xavier University?  Yes, Xavier in New Orleans.  Do you remember what led to your decision?  Yes. Xavier is an interesting, fascinating school. I had a high school  teacher, chemistry teacher, Mr. Webster, James Webster was his name. I  was a pretty good student. He was a graduate of Xavier and teaching in  science. He thought that I should go to Xavier in chemistry because  Xavier had a reputation at the time for having a good pre-med pharmacy  program and the sciences. Very good and still to this day. But it   s a  historical black college. It   s a Catholic school. It was the only co-educational  Catholic college in the world because they had to have  special dispensation from the Pope to have that school exist. Founded by  a woman from a very wealthy family in Philadelphia, the Drexels, so  Katherine Drexel, who is now Saint Katherine Drexel because she has  been canonized as a saint. Saint Katherine Drexel was the founder of this  order of nuns called the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament whose  responsibility was to provide service to Native Americans and to blacks  in education. They had schools in South Dakota, in Arizona on the  reservation, and in New Orleans. New Orleans became their flagship.  But that school was run entirely on the money of Katherine Drexel   s  family, the Drexel family. The Order and the school was run entirely by  that person.  Did you pay tuition or did you have a scholarship?  Tuition was very, very cheap. They kept tuition very low. I remember in  those days college costs for me at Xavier was  200 a semester and it was  hard to make. I worked in the summers to make enough money and  doing the post office over Christmas vacation. That   s where I worked, at  the post office about two weeks and usually made enough money. I had  my aunt, Aunt Anna, who I lived with partly while I was in college. She  helped me pay my tuition. I worked summers to make enough money to  pay tuition. An 18 hour semester, four years, I was finished.  Earl you talked about you had a high school teacher that interested you  in chemistry, is that where your desire to major in chemistry came from?  Well, I was always good in science. Science and history were my two  major areas of   matter of fact I have a minor in history in college and  had a choice of going to law school because I had a professor Dr. Paul  10  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  Konkel who was a graduate of the University of Texas. He wanted me to  go to law school and he would   ve gotten me into Texas law school, but  that was 1956 and I really didn   t have the pioneering spirit to go to  Texas. But chemistry was my first love so I decided to go in the  chemistry direction.  So you got your undergraduate degree at Xavier and then you moved to  Michigan State, got your master   s and doctorate. Can you talk a little bit  about your experience there and was that a little bit of cultural shock for  you going to Michigan?  Well, it was culture shock, major culture shock, because leaving New  Orleans and going to Michigan   remember, I left in 1956, this was the  beginning of the peak for the Civil Rights Movement. Civil Rights and  war, and anti-war. I was involved in some civil rights activities in New  Orleans. I was part of a New Orleans group who integrated the Dry  Street Area in New Orleans. It was a group of young businessmen, black  businessmen and also some young preachers who formed this coalition. I  was president of my senior class in college and so as a senior class  president I became involved with that group as part of the group and did  the picketing.  That was a year that our class was the first class at Xavier to not get  class rings because the person that sold the rings to us was a leader of  the White Citizens    Council, which was what I called    the Klan with ties  on.    So we decided to not get class rings that year, which I led as the  president of the class to show our support for civil rights activities. And  we had the boycott and  decided to  not get the class rings. But that  experience at Xavier was very good for me at the time because when I  went to Xavier I went there as a young student interested in getting an  education, going on to graduate school, and I had good mentors at  Xavier. So going to Xavier was a positive thing. My brothers and sisters  went to the other black school. Dillard was the other school in town. My  two brothers got their degrees in chemistry from Dillard. Dillard was a  Methodist school and I went to the Catholic school. A Methodist going  to the Catholic school. (Laughs)  So you graduated at Michigan State and I guess in 1967 you came to  Oklahoma State as a research associate?  Let me go back and talk about the Michigan State experience.  Okay, sure.  Because I think you asked me a question on it. Michigan State was  really quite a shock for me moving there because when I moved to  11  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  Michigan State I moved from a segregated environment to a totally  integrated environment. I had fantastic experiences there with all the  people. When I first moved there, I came to Michigan State with a trunk.  A large trunk, which I travelled on a train. I rode the City of New  Orleans train to Chicago and then from Chicago to East Lansing and got  off at the station at East Lansing. Had to get a cab to get to campus.  They had married student housing. I was there by myself. Bernice was  not there. She stayed home. We had one child. So I went up with ten  dollars to last me for the rest of the month until I got my first check. But  I had a trunk that was loaded with goodies because my family had  stuffed all sorts of things in my trunk. And so with ten dollars I could  buy rice. I could buy chicken necks and backs. I could cook so I could  make myself some chicken, make some gravy, get a little milk because  things were pretty cheap then. So ten dollars lasted me a full month. I  had enough food and cans and stuff in the trunk to last me for the month.  Bernice couldn   t come until I got my first check, so I   d send her money  to buy the train ticket to come up to Michigan.  This is for your assistantship?  For my assistantship, my graduate assistantship. And so that was a great  thing because I had some young colleagues who took me under their  wing. Didn   t have a car, and it was cold. Didn   t have the clothes. It got  cold in Michigan. Didn   t know a thing about heavy coats, never had to  have one. I finally found a place to get a coat, a very cheap coat. A guy  loaned me a coat, let me borrow a coat first then I finally bought one.  Then, Bernice came the next month and from that point on we adjusted  quite easily. And living off  222.22 per month was my, I remember that  very distinctly. That was a lot of money for me. Because I had not made  over  150 a month working in the summers. So that was pretty good, it  paid the rent. I had enough money to pay the rent and to buy baby food.  One of the tragic things of the time is I smoked and so I   d buy a carton  of cigarettes a month. Bernice used to shake her finger at me and say,     This is enough that you   re burning up. That should be for baby food.     (Laughs) So I quit smoking.  Little guilt trip there.  Yes.  How would you characterize your experience there at Michigan State?  Academically and socially?  Academically, it really didn   t work because I was coming from a black  school and then going up there and going to school with those kids who  had been from MIT. And we had one from Harvard, we had some Big  12  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Ten schools, Ohio State, and there were a few kids from private schools  like St. Olaf College. I thought that well, you know, this is going to be  very difficult and I know that it was difficult to make   my first semester  I didn   t do very well. And by not doing very well meant that I did not  make all A   s. As a matter of fact, I got a couple of B   s and a C in a  course, a physical chemistry course, which was really quite shocking to  me at the time because I felt that I should   ve earned a better grade than  that. But I got a C my first semester. And I remember visiting with the  department head about it and he looked at me and he said,    Well, young  man, you   re not the only one. We have some students here from schools  that are a lot better than yours that got C   s, that got worse grades than  you.    So he said,    Just settle down and you   ll make it, you   ll be okay.     He was right. So I settled down and decided to hit it a little harder and  knew what my abilities were and didn   t have any problems academically  from that point on. But the first semester was very traumatic. I didn   t  know whether I was going to stay there or not and when you got a  family and don   t know   it   s somewhat miraculous to that extent. But I  had good support from all of the faculty there. My mentors were great  mentors. I had good colleagues. It was the best experience anyone  could   ve had.  Let me back up, I meant to ask you, when you come from living in the  projects with seven kids and then of course the parents, nine living in   I  mean can you describe a little bit the home that you lived in?  Yes.  A little bit of what that was like for you?  Yes, we had a three bedroom place. The kids being small that meant you  had four and three in a room. The three boys and we had one little baby  boy who kind of slept with Mom and Dad in their room. But the three  girls were in one room, baby girls, and the three boys, we slept in one  bed. Two of us at one end and one in the middle down at the other end,  so we had feet in our faces. (Laughter) But we slept three in a bed, very  comfortable. If we needed to get more space one of us would sleep  downstairs on the sofa. So we had an upstairs where the bedrooms were  and years later we just used the living room sofa as a place to sleep, pull  out the bed at night and then we   d sleep two to a bed. So that worked out  very well.  So you finished your Ph.D. in    67 at Michigan State        66.     66. Then you came to Oklahoma State in   67?  13  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  I came to Stillwater on January 1, 1967 at 4pm. We just came to stay at  the Holiday Inn. We drove in from Michigan. Left Michigan after the  Christmas holidays and drove pulling a four-wheel U-Haul truck on the  back of a new car I just bought, an Oldsmobile, just bought it before I  left. What   s fascinating about that is I was member of the Michigan  State University Credit Union so before I left town I went and borrowed  money, bought a car, and that was standard for the Credit Union.  Students who left there, they were able to get loans to get a job and  stayed members of the Credit Union. I was a member of the Credit  Union for a long time.  Earl, what influenced you to come to Oklahoma State University? Did  you have a contact or know somebody here?  Yes, George  R.  Waller sent a notice out, as did most researchers. They  sent out notices to all the other colleagues saying that post-doc positions  opened for research and I saw that, it came through. So I wrote him and  said I   ll be finishing up sometime in the end of October and I   d like to  apply for this position. So he wrote me back and said,    Yes, come on,  I   d like to have you.    Now I had a position, so it gave me incentive to  hurry up and get my degree finished. So I wrote my dissertation   this  was about six months before I finished   so I wrote the dissertation and  got the research completed. And I stayed on for three months as a post-doc  at Michigan State to finish up some research work I   d done on a  grant. Then, came here to be involved with his great new instrument that  he had called a mass spectrometer.  As it turns out, George had one of the first GC/MS Gas chromatograph-mass  spectrometers in the country. It was built in Sweden and it is now  in the Smithsonian Institute as one of the first. And so I came here to  work in that area and that   s the hottest area going for studying small  molecules and so I came to be a part of that. Out of that I was able to get  a research publication in which we were on the cover of Science  magazine for this. They did a story on the study of catnip, metabolism of  ingredients of catnip. So in 1969 we had a cover story in Science for this  research. Everybody has their three minutes of fame.  Now was George department head?  No, George was a professor, George Waller. And that instrument that he  got, he had it moved here from Sweden. Actually, Henry Bellmon,   who  was Governor, had to use the National Guard to transport it here  to Stillwater. They had no other way of getting it here. So they used the  National Guard to get this here because it   s a National Science  Foundation grant that got the instrument and brought it here to  Stillwater.  14  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  How does it make you feel that it was cutting edge then and now it   s in  the Smithsonian? (Laughter)  That   s right. (Laughter) Yes.  A few years lapse.  That   s right, a few years lapsed.  So the recruitment and interview process, when you came here, you  came here as a post-doc, is that right?  Post-doc research associate.  Now, did you have to go through a further process to actually get an  assistantship and start     Well, the post-doc is a non-tenure track faculty position. And the way  the culture is in biochemistry, you have to do post-doctoral work before  you even look for an academic position. When I was here with George  Waller, I worked pretty hard and was part of the laboratory and had  several projects that I initiated myself with George. With him. So I was  kind of like a junior faculty member in that sense, in terms of working  with the department. I worked with students and did everything you can  do except teach. I helped him in some of his classes, but mostly  research. It   s what you call a great honeymoon for anyone that finished a  Ph.D. as a post-doc experience because you have all the freedom in the  world to do research and publish papers. That   s the name of the game,  publishing papers. And we published quite a few papers in that time.  But a faculty position opened up here. Jimmy Webster retired and there  was a position open at OSU in Biochemistry. The interview process  brought in a number of people who were coming in from outside for the  position. I was here at the time and hadn   t thought about staying here,  but then the position opened up and one of my colleagues in the  department said,    Earl, why don   t you apply for the position? The  people coming in, some of them don   t have the credentials you have.  Why don   t you apply for it?    So I decided well, I   d probably put my  name in the hat. It was a good time. I had been here two years. So a  position opened up academically and I thought,    Well, that   s a good  idea. I like it here. I like the research and I have some ideas on things I   d  like to do.    I applied and most of the people in the faculty, I think all of  them almost unanimously, I was the one they wanted to keep around on  the faculty. That was very reassuring and I was very fortunate because I  was able to write a proposal, got two funded grants right away, NSF and  NIH grants funded, and began the process of becoming a full faculty  15  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  member, working on tenure, publishing papers, teaching. I knew at that  time that nothing was going to get me tenure other than having some  good research, publishing, and doing good teaching. Doing one was not  going to get it.  What were your first impressions of Oklahoma State when you came  here?  (Laughter) This is a great story. My first impression, I had never been  west of the Mississippi or west of New Orleans in my life because  Michigan   s still in the east. Coming to Oklahoma was quite a shock  because I saw these people with cowboy hats on. When you grow up in  New Orleans, cowboy hats are Mardi Gras so I thought there was some  sort of a costume party. Everybody wore these cowboy hats and boots. It  was very different. But then I found out that was real. But what   s even  more fascinating is the first year I was here, there was a fraternity called  Kappa Alpha  Order . They had a special program in which they  acknowledged the Civil War. So they would ride across the campus with  guns and with these rebel outfits on and sabers. I was going to the  Student Union one day and there were these guys riding out with these  sabers and riding across campus. And I said,    Lo and behold, where am  I? What is going on here?    Well, as it turns out, the students weren   t too  pleased about that either, and the students thought that was rather  ridiculously silly. They really panned them quite a bit for this rebel  attitude   rebel yell. I said I didn   t know where I was at this time. But  that was one of the interesting things about coming to Oklahoma is  seeing the complete Western culture.  During the process of you coming to work for you post-doc and then  moving into a tenure track position, did you ever feel that race was an  issue at all? You were one of the first black faculty members     Yes, right. I never felt race was an issue in my department, but it was an  issue within the university. The thing that kept me here was that I had  what I call a great bunch of colleagues. Race was not an issue, I was just  another scientist. My acceptance was based upon my ability to be a good  scientist and to be productive. That   s all that mattered. Race was  immaterial but it was a difficult living in Stillwater and also being at the  university because the university as a whole   I remember my first  evaluations from students, comments on my evaluations like, I  remember this one very strongly because it said,    This guy   s okay, but  he   s not the kind of race I   d like.    I mean that   s on the evaluation form. I  got lots of things like that. Most of the students were very open, but  there were a few that were difficult. But race was more of a difficulty for  the family and for Bernice than for me on campus.  16  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  Who was department head at that time?  Roger Koeppe. Great department head. Roger Koeppe grew up as a  missionary. His parents were missionaries in China. So Roger had a very  special concern about doing good things and in terms of equality, he felt  very good about those kinds of things.  Do you remember the department of biochemistry at that time, where the  classes were held, a little about the facilities?  Yes. We were in the Physical Science building, but the classes were held  pretty much all over campus. My second year teaching I taught the vet  students, which was a course for all the vet students that was taught at  7:30 in the morning. That class met out at the Vet Med building, the  building where they did large animal exhibits. It was a hard floor in  which you had, the chairs were further back, but the floor as far as you  could bring horses and live animals in it meant you had to bring a board  that was on wheels, a rolling blackboard. And so every morning before  class, three times a week, I would have to come in, move a desk, move  that rolling blackboard, prop a desk on it so it wouldn   t roll as I talked,  as I wrote on it and use that to give my lecture. No lecture lectern. And  give my lecture and write on the board because those were the days  before we had good overhead projectors and equipment. Everything had  to be written on the board, and so I had to write on that board, and every  now and then it would slip and start sliding. As I was writing on the  board, it would roll across. That was my first experience.  So you had to get there early every day?  Yes, get there very early for a 7:30 class  So I taught 7:30 classes for the  first 15 years here and I had the last 7:30 class on Saturday morning, the  last one taught. It was for the vet students. They had a laboratory at 8:00  on Saturday morning, which we   d come and open up the lab and have  them come do their laboratory work. But then the university, the Vet  School, decided to make Biochemistry a pre-requisite rather than part of  the curriculum. Because these students took Biochemistry at 7:30 in the  morning; toughest course they could have besides Anatomy. It was very  hard, I know, at 7:30. They went to class from 7:30 to 5, five days a  week and on Saturdays. One year I had a starting tight-end who was a  vet student who never made any Saturday classes because of football in  the fall. He got a B in the course with no problem. (Laughs)  In addition to Dr. Waller, did you have some mentors or faculty  members who were especially helpful to you in those early years?  Well, yes. There were a number of   we were all colleagues, and so we  17  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  worked together. E.C. Nelson was probably one because we published  together. I remember Kermit Carraway, is no longer here, we were very  close friends. Kurt Ebner, who left here. Bob  Robert  Gholson who  retired, we did some work together, too. And George Odell. George  Odell was also my neighbor down the street from where I lived so that  was rather nice, and E.C. Nelson lived around the corner not too far  from me. So we were the Eastsiders, we called ourselves. So we had a  very great camaraderie with each other in the department. We shared  things   and that was the nice thing about   see Biochemistry, I knew of  many departments where each person had their own fiefdom. That   s  pretty typical. But at Oklahoma State University we shared equipment  with each other and we helped each other and that still goes on today.  That was the thing that made life so much easier, so much simpler is that  we were very cooperative with each other and that really helped quite a  bit.  Earl, am I correct, and maybe correct me here, but were you the first  African American to get tenure at Oklahoma State University?  Well, I think Lionel Arnold came here as a full professor, as a tenured  professor, I think I had received tenure by that time, by the time he got  here. I was tenured, I   m probably the first to receive tenure. But he was  the first professor and he moved here from the LeMoyne College in the  Department of Religion at the time, or Humanities. And he retired, but  he was the first African American who was a full professor at OSU.  But you were the first to receive tenure?  I   m the first to receive tenure through the ranks of going up and  promotions all the way up.  Is that special looking back and reflecting on that?  Yes, now that I look back on it, it was special. But at the time it was just  a normal progression of the way we did things in the department. I  wasn   t different from anybody else. And remember, we had people in  the department who did not get tenure. So getting tenure in the  department   Roger Koeppe was somewhat genius in looking at that  because he evaluated people very early and he could probably tell if you  were going to get tenure very early. We had at that time, he would do  early promotion for tenure. You could get tenured in three or four years.  There were certain signs that you were going to be productive. Those  signs were if you became a member of the society and you were able to  get grants and you had good evaluations in teaching, then tenure was  going to be an option right away. They were good signs in that you were  going to be   and you had some stature in the profession, that was the  18  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  main thing. If you did not have those, then you were not going to get  tenure and he made it very clear from the beginning. You could fill out  your years but you   re not going to get tenured.  Earl, you alluded earlier, you may want to expand on it, but how well  were you received by your faculty members, by teachers, by students?  I had no problems in terms of being received by my colleagues. Even  across campus because I became involved in a number of different  committees and part of the university. But I think part of it is that I  became actively involved in the academia profession. I remember one of  the early courses that were started by Dan Kroll who was in English.  Dan Kroll thought we should have a course on peace. So he put together  a seminar series in which I was one of the organizers of, to give some  talks on peace. Because he said, in the university we have lots of courses  on war. In history, we have war and all behavior. He said,    But there   s  not one course on peace.    And so he put together a seminar. And I still  say today that we don   t have any courses on peace and such. I think the  term used was i-r-e-n-olgy, irenolgy the study of peace. And he always  thought we should have a course on peace and no one   s ever followed  that through since.  (Laughs) Well, expand on that question a little bit Earl, what was the  OSU environment like for African Americans, faculty generally in the  late    60s?  In the late    60s, again, I have to preface my experiences with the  department. There were other faculty members that came here that did  not have even close to the experience I had, because they never had the  relationship in their departments. So we had a lot of turnover. We had  departments that would not accept their faculty members very well. We  had   let me give you one example. We tried to establish a Black Studies  program. That was pushed by the students, and I chaired a committee.  Jay Boggs was interested in establishing some academic units in this  area so he thought,    Good idea, why don   t we get some of these people  in these African American studies areas to develop an area?    And he put  together a budget to hire three new faculty in the area. Now, when he put  that budget out and offered to hire three new faculty members, the  committee started looking,    Well, let   s look at where they would be.  What departments?    Well, I   m not going to mention a name, but there  was one department at the time that would not even consider the idea,  even though it would not cost them anything in terms of budget. It was  not going to take away any faculty positions from them, but they didn   t  want to have any part of it and they made it very clear they were not  going to cooperate. You cannot get things done if the faculty won   t  cooperate and so we had a chance to hire three new minority faculty  19  Gill  Mitchell  members; that was 1972. Jay was willing to do that and put the money  up, because as the Vice President of Academic Affairs he controlled all  the money so he could establish that. And this department was not  interested at all in the area, they were not accepting.  Those were the kinds of things that  happened to  other blacks on the  campus   we had a lot of turnover and people had difficulty. I think the  only reason I was able to not have those problems is because I had an  environment that was very very protective and very reassuring. As long  as I was being productive as a scientist, I could be involved and be into  other things and I was involved in other things, things that were  controversial in terms of the university. But knowing that I had to write  papers and do research, produce students, that was an honest test. I think  people don   t understand because my time in doing those other things I  made sure to not detract from my main responsibility. I knew I still had  to do that. So what happened? Well on weekends, I   d be here on  weekends. I   d go home, put the kids to bed, come back to the lab at  night. That was pretty standard. Saturday was a standard time to go into  the office. Every Saturday morning, we   d go and that   s when I   d sit  down and read the journals and get experiments done, also it was  teaching, too. So family and job all became entwined. And that   s what  made it interesting. I only took a maximum of two weeks    vacation. I  had 22 days a year. I think the first 15, 20 years we only took the two  weeks, in August, vacation. That   s all we ever took.  Earl, what do you recall the black student experience was like at that  time?  When I came the black students were pretty much isolated. They had  difficulty with classes, they had difficulty with some faculty, depends on  what classes they were in. Especially, difficulty with other students  because the system was that if you were part of a sorority or fraternity,  you had access to a lot of information and black students didn   t have that  information. People wouldn   t share it with them. The Afro-American  Students Association was formed in 1968 and I was the first advisor,  because students were concerned about their own education and wanted  to organize in some fashion that they could have some impact on their  own education. Remember the town was very much segregated at the  time. You had South Stillwater, which there was a place south of... the  church that students went to was Mount Zion, the black church. Students  would go to many churches in this town. We had a system whereby  international students were very much welcome into the homes of most  of the people in town, but not African American students. And the  students knew that. That was the thing that really kind of disturbed me  was that we had all these open arms for international students,  particularly Ethiopian students, but yet African American students were  20  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  not welcome. They were like... they were strangers in their own home.  Because being African American, people said,    You know, you   re not  foreign, you   re just like everybody else.    But no one would welcome  them into their homes. We had no home program for black students.  Earl you talked about being the faculty advisor to the Afro-American  Student Association, the first one. Did you have students that would  come to you for personal advice and academic advice?  Yes, I had a number of students come to me with all sorts of problems.  A lot of the problems stemmed from the classroom, it stemmed from  feelings of not being treated fairly. That was most of the problems.  Many of those I could deal with because on some occasions I could  contact faculty members who didn   t have a clue as to what they were  doing. And that was interesting because in some cases I knew a faculty   member  and I could talk to them about what was happening to a  student so they could make a student feel more welcome into the  program. And many did. Interesting that when the students left campus  for the black student boycott, when they came back the faculty were  very open to let the students make up the work. The difficulty the  students had were from graduate assistants, from those white students  who were graduate assistants. They were the worst in terms of behavior  towards the students. Faculty were very very helpful and very  understanding of the students and that was a reassuring thing for me at  the time.  Earl, you alluded to the environment of Stillwater for your family, could  you expand on that?  Yes, let me give you some specific examples. Even though we lived on  the east side of town we were only the second family to live outside of  the south side of Stillwater. Sylvester Combs, the other family that lived  in Stillwater, they lived on the west side and we lived on the east side     Sam Combs?  No not Sam, Sylvester. His wife worked for extension service at OSU  and Sylvester taught at the middle school, he taught shop. To say about  things being off limits, my son, Doug, spent a weekend in jail when he  was 16 years old. We went to Chicago, I   ve never told this story before  but I can tell it now. We went to Chicago with Bob and Gloria Webber,  we went to Chicago to see the King Tut exhibit and we left the kids here.  Michael was with a friend, and Karen was old enough to stay at home,  and Doug was at home. Doug was 16. Because Doug worked at the  Student Union at the time, they hired him, so he was going to work. We  were gone for a long weekend. We left on Wednesday and came back on  21  Saturday. I got back home on Saturday and the house was clean, it  looked like nobody had been there for a couple of days. So I figured  Doug was at work. I went over to the Student Union to find out and they  said,    No, he never showed up for work.    So now the panic: Where   s  Doug? What happened? I called Karen and Karen said she didn   t know,  she   d not heard from him.  Well, it   s interesting, about ten minutes later I was in the house getting  ready to call the police, put an APB out, say my son   s missing, and I got  a call from Paul Anderson. Paul Anderson was a lawyer at the time. He  says,    Earl, did you know your son is locked up in jail?    No, I didn   t.  He said,    He   s down there.    He says,    We can get him out. If you come  down I   ll get him released.    Paul was not the DA at the time, he was a  lawyer. So I went down there and Doug was just, you know, he was  scared. He was more scared because he thought Dad was going to be  upset with him.  And I found out what happened. Well Doug on Friday, Doug and  Jerome Clark   Jerome Clark was a wrestler, ended up going to the  Naval Academy, he got a degree at the Naval Academy. But Jerome  Clark, they went to play basketball, the high school was open for  basketball so Doug went to play basketball on Friday. And while playing  basketball, a little girl, Kelly, who lives up on, I think, Osage Street,  said,    Why don   t you come by later, come by the house?    Her family  had a pool. He was going to go by Kelly   s and swim because her mother  had invited the kids to come over. Doug had the car, so he parked on the  corner under the light, walked across this lawn, and didn   t quite know  where the house was, so he came back to the car. Meanwhile, the person  who lived in that corner house called the police to say there was a black  prowler in the neighborhood. So Doug got out, went and stepped on the  porch and he knocked on the door. A policeman said,    Freeze     And the  woman opened the door, came in, the police said,    We got this peeping  Tom here, this burglar here.    And she said,    Oh, Doug,    she said,     Kelly, Doug is here.    And the policeman said,    No, he   s a trespasser, a  peeping Tom.    And so the lady said,    Well, can you let him stay here  because we know him?    He said,    No, I   ve got to take him in.     So he took him in and he called Judge, I can   t remember the Judge we  had on juveniles at the time, called the judge, Judge York. And he asked,     I got a Negro subject here, parents can   t be found, what to do?    And he  said,    Well, hold him until we can arraign him on Monday.    So he took  him and put him down in the county jail. Doug said,    I need to make a  phone call, I need to call and let people know where I am.    Well, here   s  the clincher. Doug knew and Karen knew, if they needed any help, they  were to call Ray Wall, the district judge. Bernice was the bailiff at the  district judge. They would not let him make a phone call and Ray was  22  Gill  Mitchell  just livid when he found out about that. Doug was not allowed to make a  phone call. So when I got there and took him home, I reassured Doug  that he did nothing wrong, and there   s no   and this is where Doug got a  lesson too because Doug really found out that there   s some places that   s  off limits to him as a black running around in Stillwater. It was a lesson  to him. But I also wanted to give him another lesson, that he   d done  nothing wrong and that his parents were supportive.  So on Monday morning I contacted the judge and I contacted Eli, the  captain, Captain Eli and we met with the policeman face to face to talk  about this incident. Captain Eli was just outraged that this would happen  and so was the judge. The judge   but here   s what   s interesting   the  judge said,    Well, if you   d told me it was Earl Mitchell   s kid, it was  okay.    Well, that adds to the problem. That means that only because he   s  Earl Mitchell   s kid, but he was seen as just another black kid in the  neighborhood. And so that was quite an experience. But also, he also  knew that his parents were supportive and he learned something about     because he had been friends with some of the kids in the neighborhood  that people knew and he was a good kid, had to spend a night in jail.  Now, here   s the thing that   s interesting, that policeman who pulled a gun  on him is the one that later killed a teenager in a chase when he thought  the kid had a gun. So I think, well that   s really, we were lucky. Because  if Doug had done any move, he would   ve been dead. That   s an  experience that you get as a black living in Stillwater.  And Karen was at the Girl Scout camp  Camp Scott  when the girl  scouts were killed, she was one of the training cadets there. So she  experienced the rape and murder of those Girl Scout kids, she was there  at the camp at the time as one of the leaders  June 12, 1977  and was a  witness in the case against Gene Leroy Hart because they found some of  her things from her locker in a cave that he had. It was a mirror that she  had as a little kid and a hat with a corncob pipe that I had bought her.  They found that in his possession because he had broken into camp that  weekend and broke into her   and took those things out. So she was a  witness to identify those things. So those kinds of experiences you have  as a family member.  Earl, back about the time you had tenure, early    70s, how many black  professors did we have on campus at that time? What numbers are we  talking about?  Well, we went through a number of eight, ten, eleven, maybe. Because  people came and went very fast. So we had I think at the height in the     70s we had about 11 at the time. There were various levels of faculty.  Some were instructors, some were assistant professors, but those were  the tenure track people. Not very many.  23  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Were there some other black faculty that you remember in that era that  stand out in your mind?  Well, of course, Lionel Arnold was one because he was Bernice   s  advisor. And she was one of the few people who got a degree in the area  that no longer exists anymore, in humanities. Lionel Arnold was one.  George Taylor, who left here and went to Virginia State and is now  retired, George was in the sociology department. He and I were good  friends, good colleagues working with the students. George was in the  corrections area, so he knew a lot about corrections. Those were the two  who were probably   Nudie Williams was another one. Nudie got his  degree here. He was an instructor in history. He   s deceased now, but  Nudie was another one. See Nudie got a degree in biology so we were  scientists first but he went to history and did very well in history.  Were there any special concerns or issues that black faculty had at that  time?  The main concern of black faculty were students and getting more black  faculty. That   s always been a concern. Getting more people who look  like us for the students, and who could go through in all areas of the  university. The College of Education probably had more consistent  people hired   tenure-track people. They had the largest number at any  one time, the College of Education. Katie Perry is still a good friend and  she   s been through. And Vandee McGlonn is retired, I remember  Vandee McGlonn. And Betty Gaffney, who just died recently, was a  good stable person in the university. They were always very helpful to  students. Having those faculty over in the College of Education at HES  was really very helpful to every black student over there.  Earl, you told me the average is somewhere around 11 or 12 faculty  members coming and going, but there was a lot of African American  students at that time. That ratio of instructors even to African American  students was pretty high, wasn   t it?  We got up to close to 1000 or so African American students here on the  campus, which is quite a large number. It dropped down towards 500 or  400 at one time. When I went in as Associate Vice President, the number  was down to 400 but we started working to get the numbers back up  again. Engineering has done a marvelous job in getting students in there,  in that area, recruiting. Matter of fact, I think it   s been outstanding in  that sense.  We were talking a little bit about black faculty/staff issues. But about  that time, maybe you remember the year it was, but the Black Faculty  Staff Association was formed.  24  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  Yes.  Do you remember a little bit about that? Can you share some  information with us on that?  The feeling of most of us at the time, we needed to have some sort of  organization for two purposes: one for our own camaraderie, and two, to  do what we could to help students. The first thing we did when we  formed our organization was establish a scholarship committee. Because  we thought we should give students financial help when we can, not  very much, but it was a gesture we thought was important because  of   our primary mission. Our primary goal for being here was to help  students even though we had a professional responsibility, too. So we  formed an organization and primarily in terms for some social activities  too. So we   d just get together. We were all separated and, just like the  students, the students don   t realize this either, but see students will go to  class, there are very few black students who will see other black students  in their classes even though it   s a large campus and a large number of  black students. They are not necessarily in the same class with each  other, very rarely you have the same class. That same thing happens to  us. We   re isolated too. Because we   re in our disciplines and we don   t get  together very often, because we are so isolated. And I think the students  don   t understand that either. But we thought having a Black  Faculty/Staff Association would give us a chance to know each other,  know who we are, and also do some mentoring to each other.  One of the things that I took it upon myself to do is to try and talk to the  younger faculty members about what was required to get tenure. That  was an interesting part because getting tenure varied quite a bit on the  campus depending upon the discipline, but if you were African  American or black, you had to be sure that you did all the things   you  could not do what everybody else did to get tenure, let   s put it that way.  For example, if joining the Kiwanis Club and being involved in other  activities helped you get tenure in the department, if you were black that  wouldn   t work. You   ve got to publish papers, you   ve got to write, write  your books, you   ve got to teach your classes. It   s important that you  understand that, that that   s important to get tenured. Everything else is  immaterial. So all the extra things you do that seem nice and something  that people appreciate, won   t get you tenure. That was part of what I  figured was my responsibility to let them know that component of the  academia, what it meant.  Do you remember what year you formed the Black Faculty/Staff  Association?  That was formed in the mid-70s, sometime in the mid-70s. I remember  25  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  George Taylor was here we first got the group together.  Do you remember some of the early leaders in the organization?  Like I said, George Taylor was one. Tom Wetzel became involved later.  In the early stages, Nudie Williams was part of it, even though he was an  instructor, still a graduate student. Katie Perry and Betty Gaffney, they  were all part of it. All members of the Black Faculty/Staff.  Was Patricia Bell here at that time?  Pat came about    78, and got involved    78,    79 she came about that time  and got involved in it, yes.  You talked about scholarships, were there other goals and issues that  you remember you had as an organization in those early years?  I think the scholarships were the primary issues. And also supporting  students. In any kind of controversial activity with students, we were  there with them from the beginning, involved with the students,  primarily as what I call a supportive and calming influence. Supportive  in terms of letting the students know that they had support from us, but  calming in the sense that it   s important that you don   t go too far. That  you don   t push things too far that will be problematic for everybody  else. That doesn   t mean backing down. It meant doing things in a proper  manner.  One of the other issues I was going to ask you about, was there  connectivity in any way with the Faculty Council? In terms of structure  of that organization outside of that organization?  Well, the only thing that the Black Faculty/Staff was able to do with  Faculty Council was to convince the Faculty Council that they needed to  have representation of minority faculty. So we have a position that they  created, a minority position that represents minorities on the faculty.  And that was something that we pushed as part of the Black  Faculty/Staff. We have a Native American Faculty/Staff and there   s a  Hispanic Faculty/Staff group, but we were the ones that started it and  pushed it. But what   s interesting about that process is that if you look at  the number of minority faculty, the largest group is Asian. We have a  little over 100 Asian faculty. So when you go through a Faculty Council  election process, it   s very difficult for a black to get elected because  you   ve got more Asians voting than the blacks. I think I was the only  one elected one time to represent the minority faculty.  Back on you personally and professionally, can you briefly review your  26  Mitchell  academic career and teaching, research? We   ll talk about your  administrative responsibilities at OSU later. Will you share some of your  professional accomplishments and highlights?  Well, in teaching, I was just one of many of the department of  biochemistry. Teaching biochemistry is not an easy subject to teach to  most students because the vast majority of students really don   t want to  be there. The course I taught for a long time was a course for Ag  students, which required they take this chemistry course. And most of  them really didn   t see any sense of taking it. So that creates an onerous  task to teach a course where students really don   t want to be there. And  to have a course at 7:30 in the morning just adds to the problem. So you  have to try and make it interesting, but at the same time there   s a need to  make sure the students are knowledge-based in terms of information. So  teaching the course, as most of us have, we are not known as great  teachers   none of us will ever win any teaching awards. Mainly,  because of the style of teaching and the difficulty of the course. If the  course was easy we   d get awards, but it   s not easy. And so you have to  divide the grades up and the grades will run from A to F with lots of C   s  and sometimes lots of D   s. So that makes it difficult teaching.  Now, as a faculty member, you know that, but you feel you have to try  to open their heads up and put the knowledge in, whether they want it or  not. And that is the style of teaching. So you try all sorts of mechanisms  and procedures to do that, you spend a lot of time with them one-on-one.  I was always available to students and would spend time with special  help sessions. I ran these help sessions, which was outside of the lecture  period, and we   d set times up where students could come for an hour,  maybe set two or three hours up where I   d be available for them to come  as a group and ask questions. This is outside of class time. All students  can   t do that, so I   d try to have times where students can come. So  putting the extra time on myself. Now, I didn   t have to do that, but I felt  it was important to try to give students some extra help personally from  me outside of the lecture period because it   s very difficult. Because we  have a lot of information to cover in biochemistry and it comes so fast,  so quickly, students are not used to the terminology.  The first thing you have to learn in biochemistry is the vocabulary. The  vocabulary is also attached to the knowledge because the words that are  used to describe the pathways also tell you something about the  pathways. And if you don   t understand the words, then you can   t  understand the conversation at all. So that   s the first difficult problem. In  teaching and research, they go together. In biochemistry, we make sure  they go together. We try to incorporate the research part in your  teaching. So as things are being developed in the scientific world in  biochemistry, you bring it up in your classroom so that they can have  27  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  some sort of feeling for what   s happening in the real world with what we  teach them in this pathway. That   s pretty much the concept of teaching,  and it   s strictly lecture-style information. I think with the PowerPoint  presentations now and all that information we provide to them, it   s a  little different.  Earl, what about your research, and you probably won   t say it, but  you   ve received some pretty significant recognitions and awards in your  lifetime. I   m thinking of some like Distinguished 100 African American  Scientists of the 20th Century     Yes.     pretty impressive. Member of the Board of Oklahoma School of  Science and Mathematics, special research recognition. Can you share a  little bit about your research with us?  I consider my research to be just average research for a biochemist and it  really is nothing outstanding or exciting. Except that I think the few  things I   ve done, like I say, having a story to cover Sciences, you know  you reach a peak and from that point it   s downhill. But I think being a  teacher of science and also being involved with research gives me  something very special to offer in terms of the public. For example,  being involved with  the  School of Science and Math, it   s because I was  a scientist and have been involved with research grants, writing papers,  publishing papers, doing research, having students. I think that kind of  experience helps me to work in what I call the    real world.    So being  involved with the School of Science and Math was quite an accolade for  me because I was instrumental in getting it started. And again, it   s  because of my interest in the next generation of scientists and how we  can transfer information to somehow brighter students. And that   s  always a problem. Sometimes the most discriminated people in the  world are the very smart. (Laughs) They   re sometimes left out in a lot of  things.  And just background information, the Oklahoma Science and Math  School is a special school for bright students     Yes, it   s special. It   s one of the few state-supported residence schools for  our very bright students in Oklahoma and so it   s a state-wide school in  which students come from all over the state to get this special  curriculum. That   s a college curriculum for these students for the two  years they   re in high school. They go off to do marvelous things. We   ve  seen some great results from these students today.  You served on that board. Did you ever help in the curriculum  28  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  development or anything?  No, as a board we   re just overseers. As a board, we just hire the best  director we can find, the principal. (Laughs) And the president. And just  turn it loose.  Were you involved in this AMP  Alliance for Minority Participation   part of your academic side of it, or is that later     No, in 1994, the State Regents formed a group called the  Underrepresented Minorities in Science, Oklahoma Science and Math  for Minorities. They formed an organization of all the colleges in the  state. I was fortunate enough to be involved in that and became Chair of  that board for what they called the AMP Program, science and math  program. It   s an alliance of schools. Alliance for science and math in  terms of college. The purpose of the alliance is to enhance the number of  underrepresented minorities, that is black, Hispanic, Native Americans,  Pacific Islanders, earning degrees in science and math and technology in  the state of Oklahoma. And from that I was able to write a grant and get  funding from the National Science Foundation for this alliance, which  has lasted for 15 years.  And that   s a summer program, isn   t it?  The summer program is one, but it supports students in an academic  year. And nine campuses, OSU being the lead institution, which  supports students with stipends and they do summer internships and  research. The idea is to have them graduate and go to graduate school  and get their Ph.D. in the science or math area. That   s the goal   or go to  work in the science industry. We   ve been very successful in supporting a  lot of students who   ve gone on and gotten their Ph.D.s. We have a  second phase of that program now called the Bridge to Doctorate  Program in which the students will be going into graduate school to  bridge from the baccalaureate to the doctorate. The grant will support  them for two years and then the university will find a way to get them a  Ph.D. later. We have several people who have earned their Ph.D.s now.  Well, speaking of that, in your experience with those programs but also  as a faculty member at Oklahoma State, are there some students that  you   ve mentored and tutored and personally counseled that stand out in  your mind as special?  I just got a note from one the other day. She   s the young lady who now  works for General Motors, Sandra McNeil. She got a degree in  Engineering. And she was the first student we had here, she   s an African  American student   matter of fact, she   s mixed, her mother is German  29  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  but her father was military. And so she speaks German. She spent a year  in Germany as an undergraduate at a research institute in Germany. Now  she   s back in Germany, she went to work for General Motors. She  worked in Oklahoma City and she moved to Dallas and they have  moved her to Germany to work for General Motors in connection with  research in Germany. I   m trying to get her to come back and get her  Ph.D. But that   s one of the students. We have another student, Sid  Carter, who is now in Sweden getting a Ph.D. He was a student here at  OSU and worked for Ulrich Melcher in Biochemistry. He is now in  Sweden earning a Ph.D. in Sweden in biochemistry. So those students  kind of stand out.  You also served many years as an Associate Vice President for  Multicultural Affairs. Can you talk about some of the initiatives during  that career that you put in place and give some information about some  of the things you did?  That particular program, during the time, considered two components.  One is what I call the Affirmative Action component, in which we  develop programs for Women   s Studies as part of the diversity part of  the university   the affirmative action program which Dr. Carolyn  Hernandez was part of it, I hired her. She established all the guidelines  and rules for our affirmative action program. Then, the other initiatives  that I set up were primarily for students in terms of diversity. For  example, the talent search program and the science and math program  and the Louis Stokes program. All of those were part of the initiative  that we set up. The talent search was a trio program which is going to  great guns now, which I first wrote the proposal with Mary Lawler, and  now Deborah  Evers  has the program and she   s doing an excellent job  in running the program. This program is to get high school students  prepared for college, low socio-income high school students. And we  chose the area that   s been left out, that is the rural areas that encompass  all surrounding counties around Oklahoma going as far as Okmulgee.  Because rural students are pretty much left out, the idea is to increase the  number of college graduates from many of these young people in these  small rural areas. She   s done a great job in terms of the program.  Looking back, you mentioned other things but there were some successes  you had that you   re proud of that you think back on in the affirmative  action area and in the multicultural area?  Some of the success of affirmative action, which probably no longer  exists, one was a program that we had developed that was an incentive  program for hiring of minority faculty. That is the minority incentive  program in which the recent Vice President would supply funds for  hiring minority faculty and be aggressive about doing it. We have a  30  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  procedure which was accepted by the Department of Labor in terms of  target recruitment. So those are the things that were pushed very  strongly to increase the number of faculty. That would be one of the  really strong things that I think we had at one time that was very helpful.  Are there still unresolved issues that you   ve worked on that you can  think of?  Well, the unresolved issue is always going to be hiring of minority  faculty. Mainly, because the one part of the unresolved issue is a concept  that I   ve never been able to get anybody to buy into and it   s something  that Jay Boggs talked about in 1972. Jay Boggs said that if we can   t find  people then we need to grow our own. Well, people took that and just  said,    You know that   s crazy.    When I came here I found a lot of faculty  members were getting degrees at Oklahoma State University, and joined  the faculty. Some would go off who were on the faculty and get a Ph.D.  someplace else and then come back. I think Karl  N.  Reid,  Jr.  was  MIT and I remember Charlie Bacon was in grad school with me at  Michigan State and he came here on the faculty and he was on the  faculty at Michigan State, got his Ph.D., came back and became a  department head. Agriculture is full of them. So why couldn   t we have a  program like that for African Americans? Why can   t we make the  initiative to have a program to produce more in a graduate program? If  we can   t find them, then why don   t we have a program to get them?  There   s a Bridge to Doctorate program that the federal government has  put together, is money supported by NSF. But that   s only one area.  But we need people in all areas; in Humanities, in Education, in Vet  Med. All the areas we need people. Why can   t the Graduate College or  the graduate dean or the Vice President of Research build a program to  enhance the number of minority graduates in graduate school? I   ve been  arguing that for 40 years. No one wants to do it, no one believes it. And I  said only this way will it get done. You can continue to talk about not  having enough people, but until you start producing them you   re always  not going to have enough people. And no one will take that to heart. And  I tip my hat to Jay Boggs who wanted to do it, but he couldn   t get the  people to buy into it. He would   ve supplied the money. But I   m not  sure   there   s no commitment, there isn   t a commitment to do that now  with the administration. There is no commitment for this sort of thing.  Well Earl, looking back over the years, going back there to the late    60s,  early    70s when you came to Oklahoma State, has the environment for  black students at Oklahoma State University changed? How has it  evolved over the years?  Oh, it has changed drastically. When I see the number of students that  31  Gill  Mitchell  are involved   well just last week I went to the Master Works concert.  When I go to these things I count the number of black faces in there.  (Laughter) I still do that, everywhere I go I still see how many black  faces are in there. I saw more black students involved and outstanding  students, a freshman who plays the bass, outstanding student, two black  students on the bass, playing. One of them was in the first part, he was  one of the students running around putting everything, hooking  everything up and I said to my wife,    Oh my God, they got a black  student to do all the hard work.    Turned out he was one of the students  on the bass, one of the best bass players out there. (Laughter) So you  have to be careful how you think about these things. But yes, it   s  changed drastically in terms of acceptance. Many white students don   t  understand how it used to be. But there still is some bits of racism that  still exist, because it   s a learned thing. It   s nothing that you are born  with. You learn it from behavior, of how other people behave.  Earl, on a broader stage outside of the academy, you   ve had a passion  for human rights and issues and you   ve been socially and politically  active for many years. Can you share some of these, some of your  activities in this arena?  I became immediately involved with civil rights when I first came to  Stillwater. I became involved with the   we had a local NAACP chapter  called the Payne County Chapter NAACP. I became immediately  involved with that chapter. It existed primarily in the black community  and there were virtually a few people there. Ruby Cook and Thelma  Connors and several other people in the community were involved. I  became involved in it and became President of the chapter. I brought in  more people in the community to be involved, outside of the black  community. So we had a very active chapter and looking at   and  for   awhile our primary focus was equality for the students in Stillwater. At  that time when I first came, Washington  High  School was still in  existence. It was the last of the segregated schools even though Lee  Ward had been moved to Highland Park School as principal,  Washington School still had a few classes left, it was being closed down.  The black kids were still not part of the school system.  I remember writing a letter to the newspaper when Stillwater had an all-white  football team. There were a lot of black kids who could play  football  and  they were not welcome at that time on the team. And I  remember writing a letter saying,    I can   t understand a team that would  rather lose with all whites than to win with a few blacks.    (Laughs)The  NewsPress, I wrote a letter saying that. It kind of stirred people up a  little bit thinking about it. It made some people mad, but you know that   s  what you   re supposed to do. So I spent a lot of time working with the  black kids trying to get them in the community and helping them to do  32  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  things right. I think we missed an opportunity because there   s several  kids who went through the school system at the time who probably  would   ve come out quite a bit different if they   d had an opportunity to  participate in sports. There were some very good kids at the time that  missed out on that opportunity in Stillwater to do that. That was the  culture at the time. Very segregated because all the black kids still lived  in South Stillwater, went to school, and went home.  There was a group, a private group, called TOGs which is a girl   s  sorority type thing in high school. They didn   t take any black kids into it  at all, no black kids could be part of the TOGs. And we complained  about that. Even though I have   for me, it   s like who the hell wants to  be part of a group like that anyway? (Laughs) It   s like Dick Gregory  said, he went into a Walgreen   s one day and people said,    Oh, here they  come     and people say,    Who the hell would integrate Walgreen   s?     (Laughter) So I don   t understand. I   m not really a fraternity person, I  supported them. And kids need to have that. Some kids need to have  that. But it   s not something that I really would automatically tell kids  they ought to do, I don   t understand the system. But it   s important for  some kids to be part of it.  Earl, you were active at the statewide level as well?  Yes with the state NAACP I was active, I was active with the ACLU  too, very much active. I was Vice Chair of the ACLU at the time when  they had the prison riot down in McAlester, I was Vice Chair. Also, with  the Bobby Battle case (Battle v. Fields), we were involved with that. Lou  Bullock was involved and took over some of the cases there. That   s  where I got to meet Angie Debo because Angie was on the board and on  occasion we would drive to Marshall to pick her up and take her to the  board meetings. I got to spend a little bit of time with Angie Debo and  got to know her quite well. I became one of her persons on her mailing  list that she would call to write letters when she needed them to do  something for Native Americans. But if you didn   t write the letter, she  took you off her list and she   d tell you why. If you didn   t write a letter,  she was very bold about that.    If you   re not going to write a letter then I  don   t want your name.    (Laughter) So when Angie called you moved.  You   ve touched on a couple of things, but have there been some  highlights in your engagement in the civil rights arena through the  years?  Well, I think in terms of the working with the ACLU during the time  when we had the prison riots and also the changes that occurred with the  Bobby Battle case, which we took on as an ACLU project, and changing  the prison system was really important. The prison system still needs a  33  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  lot of work because we still incarcerate too many people for minor  things. I think that was a really important part for me at the time. And  with the state NAACP we were supportive of the initiatives in terms of  school integration and bussing because I was a member and chaired the  advisory committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. We have  produced several documents and reports on studies. A major report we  put out was the study of the integration of Tulsa. During the bussing  period, this is the early    70s or mid    70s, the U.S. Commission on Civil  Rights decided to do a study of bussing around the country and how  communities handled that integration problem. Tulsa did something that  was very unique and very different. If you remember, Tulsa didn   t have  the kind of problems that Oklahoma City had with bussing. Tulsa  decided to go with the magnet school concept and developed  Booker  T.  Washington School as a magnet school, and that has worked very  well for Tulsa in terms of integrating the school system. That was one of  the things we wrote up in our report as a really monumental thing in  terms of handling the problem and it diffused quite a bit. So even Tulsa,  with the race riot and long history, they managed to do their school  integration a lot different and a lot better than Oklahoma City.  Earl you were chair of the Oklahoma Advisory Committee of the U.S.  Commission on Civil Rights     Yes.  And you received the Oklahoma Human Rights Award from the  Oklahoma Human Rights Commission. Is that pretty special for you?  Yes, sometimes you do things not to get awards, but because it   s  something that needs to be done. When someone acknowledges it, it is  kind of special. Very special to know that people do appreciate what you  do. Even though I know from all of my past histories that the things I   ve  done may never be appreciated by anybody but me and a few people that  know. And that   s fine with me. But when someone else acknowledges it,  it really does have a bearing. Some of my human rights things are  involvement in different groups through the church   the Methodist  Church. I   ve been involved with a number of groups. I was with the  Conference Board   Vice Chair of the Conference Board of Social  Concerns in those days, now it   s called Church in Society, in which we  were looking at all the human rights issues in the church. I was involved  in that through the church. That   s been a good thing for me, because it   s  been a great outlet to be involved at a level which we can have some  impact on making some changes.  You mentioned that your Christian faith has been an informative part of  your experience. Is there any particular faith story that you have that  34  Mitchell  you can share with us? In your years of service with the church and in  your personal life?  The best story I can tell you is one that stumped me for a long time. I  teach in the School of Missions. This year I   m going to be teaching on  Darfur and the Sudan. I usually teach on some geographical aspect of the  church. I   ve taught on Vietnam. The biggest one was teaching on South  Africa. Bear with me, I have to tell you a story on this because in 1968,  the women   s division of the United Methodist Church decided to move  their funds from the Chase Manhattan Bank in New York City because  of the Apartheid problem, supporting the Apartheid, they didn   t want  any money going to South Africa. That caused quite a stir within the  church, because now the church is getting involved with politics. But the  women owned the money, they can do what they want with it. There   s  not much anybody can do with it, since they are the primary arm for the  global ministries for the United Methodist Church.  So Chase Manhattan Bank decided they needed to do something about  this. So you have hierarchy people in the Methodist Church,  businessmen, being concerned and raising holy hell about being  involved with this politics. But the women were ahead of the game.  They discovered that the Methodists didn   t know the problem in South  Africa. So they had a study in 1972-   73 on the problem of South Africa.  I taught in the School of Missions that year and learned all about the  problems of South Africa, learned about Nelson Mandela, Steve Biko,  and the whole history of South Africa. And we had a South African who  was of Boer origin who was a Methodist minister who came here and  was part of the program, Don Morton, who was from South Africa, who  had challenged the South African government.  He  was persona non  grata  and  he had to leave his country, leave his family because he was  a death wish for the government. Came to the United States, a Methodist  minister. So I got to talking to Don Morton about the problems.  And I taught that course. As you teach the course, I always offered  myself to go to church as a teacher, I taught at the School of Missions,  which is held for a long weekend. And I offer people that come to the  School of Missions that I will come to your church, help you to teach  this program. I got an invitation from Woodward, Oklahoma and  Woodward, Oklahoma they asked me to come teach about South Africa.  I go to Woodward and I teach this course about, and give all information  about South Africa, all the problems, and what the church has been  trying to do, why we took the money out, and most of them were just  totally incensed.  At that time, Kissinger was meeting with  South African leader P. W.   Botha to talk about how we can solve this problem in South Africa by  35  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  making some changes. The women in Woodward, Oklahoma thought  they should send something to Kissinger telling him that the thing he  needed to do was free Nelson Mandela, because we had talked about the  leaders and Mandela was a person that stood out. Now this is before  anybody in the country really knew that, but that of course brought that  information out. Here you have Methodist women who learned through  a mission program about the problems in South Africa and say you need  to free Nelson Mandela is quite a moment for me. It was a Eureka  moment because it really touched me to no end about what the church is  doing and what kind of things you can do with education and the  feelings of people in church in terms of the right thing. Now, this is  before anybody in the country is talking about Nelson Mandela. Those  women knew that. I consider that to be one of the miraculous things  about being involved with the church. That has touched me for a long  time.  Earl, going back to OSU just a minute, what do you remember about the  formation of the OSU Black Alumni Association? Were you a member of  the OSU Alumni Association?  Yes. Again, this is, the person who was really interested in getting that  done was Pat Bell. And she got Smith Holt to put the first money up for  the first meetings, so that was even more fascinating. But Pat, being a  graduate of OSU, undergraduate degree here, Ph.D. at U.T.-Austin,  knowing that and people she was in school with, there was a large  number of people she was aware of. She thought  they  had a connection  to OSU but did not have a connection to the university as a whole. She  thought having a Black Alumni Association would be a way to get those  people connected to the university. Because it is also helpful for our  students to know that you have all these blacks who   ve come before you,  who   ve gone through some difficult times when they were here, who are  very successful, and are still committed to you. That was the intent to get  that organization started. And so I think getting some of the people  involved with it early, and those women are still involved with it, those  graduates. Which has been a really good   Bernice and I are now life  members of the Alumni Association. We have life membership. We  have our life membership to be involved with the Black Alumni  Association, too.  In your opinion, has it been effective in helping maintain relationships  among black alumni and on behalf of the university?  Yes, it   s been effective in a sense that we have more people involved  with the Alumni Association who are African Americans in a time  period who left here and did not feel good about the university in terms  of their experiences. They bleed orange like you wouldn   t believe.  36  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  (Laughs) They bleed orange. But that experience they had, they look at  their experiences and see something now quite different because even  though their experience with the institution was not good, their  experience with each other has always been great. So they have a  support system for themselves. It   s interesting to hear them talk when  they come here about the things they did as a group and the camaraderie  that they had because they all knew each other, they supported each  other even though they had difficulty in other places. But those things  come out, so all the positive things come out with them and those  negative things become minor. It   s like I   ve always pushed, if you ever  want to see people come together, look at the common things, and then  those things that divide them become very minor. The problem with us  in this country, we   ve always let the divisive things be the controlling  factor. We look at the divisions first, we should look at the common  grounds first and the divisions become very minor.  Earl, you received the Black Alumni Association   s Trailblazer award a  couple years ago. How did that feel?  (Laughs) Yes. Again, you know, you do things and you never expect  anything and it was quite a surprise (laughs) because I didn   t even know  I was getting it and it was kind of a    Gotcha     moment. But yeah, it was  very special because it came from a group that is very special to me. So  when your own group does that, it means somebody saw something that  maybe others didn   t see. And that   s very reassuring, it   s very helpful.  Well, looking back at your years at Oklahoma State University, how has  the Biochemistry and I guess  now the  Molecular Biology Department,  changed over the years?  The change has been in terms of the type of research that   s being done.  The camaraderie is still the same. And what   s interesting is that in the  College of Agriculture, in the history of the College of Agriculture, I  was the first and only African American faculty member. I guess you  could say, I can   t remember his name now, but Jim Mosley who was in  the dean   s office from Langston, he had an academic appointment. But  he was primarily an administrator, he was not a teacher. But I was the  only African American member of the Ag research and research faculty  member until six years ago when they hired the second one. And he is in  Biochemistry, Michael Massiah. Biochemistry now has a tradition, I  guess they   ll have a black seat now. (Laughter) But we were very  fortunate to get Michael Massiah. He   s a very outstanding young  scientist, very brilliant young man.  Have there been some milestones in the department that you can think  about over the years?  37  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  Milestones in terms of growth and development. We have moved from a  very small department to a fairly large sized department. I think some of  the faculty members that have received awards have been interesting  milestones in terms of the Regent Professors and the special endowed  chairs that we have in the department. And we have people who left here  who are very very good. We got the last Borden Award  which  was  given to Kurt Ebner.  He  was a member of the department here and  that   s an outstanding award by the American Chemical Society. Kurt  Ebner received that award for some of the work he did. He did work on  a special protein in milk, which he found was not necessarily a protein  for nutrition, but was part of an enzyme system that helped catalyze a  pathway in milk, a carbohydrate pathway. A great fantastic discovery.  People had this protein around for years, didn   t know what it did. He  discovered it.  Along those same lines, were there some professors, administrators, who  stand out in your mind who were important in developing the  department?  Roger Koeppe probably stands out as much as anyone else because he  was the leading department head. Roger   s attitude was pretty much of  service. Roger thought it was important that he would do whatever he  could as a department head to see that all faculty had everything they  needed to get the work done. Now there   s a degree of paternalism in  this. And we always accused Roger of being a very benevolent dictator.  (Laughs)  Benevolent dictator.  Benevolent dictator. Which we really liked the way he did things  because he made sure that everybody had what they needed to get the  work done. And so that was really one of the things, I think he was a  very good department head in that sense. Being a dictator is not always a  thing that you really appreciate, because sometimes you do things that  makes somebody upset. But he always thought about the common good.  I learned from Roger more than anything else is that you do what you  can to provide service. The other person, not necessarily   is Norm an  N.  Durham because Norm was my mentor in the graduate college. I  worked for Norm as the Assistant Dean of the Graduate School. Norm  taught me something that has stuck with me when I became an  administrator. He said,    Our job is to make it easier for those doing the  hard work. It   s not about us.    I think one of the problems we have in the  university system in administration is that there are too many  administrators from presidents on down who   s thinking  it   s  more about  them. Norm Durham said it   s about us making it easier for them to do  the job. And so our job is to provide service.  38  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  So one of the things I did as an administrator is I never let any problem  go unsolved in the sense that if someone came to me with a problem and  I couldn   t help them, I   d find out where they needed to get the help. I  would then make sure that they got to the person and I always told them,     Come back and tell me what happened.    That I think was very effective  as an administrator, because I was able to get a lot of things solved that  way and never had anybody leave my office not knowing where to go or  just being left high and dry. Some came to me because they had been to  a place that people didn   t help them, didn   t try to help them. Sometimes  you can   t help people, but you need to find a way to help them do what  they need to do. It may not be what they want to do, but you can find  something.  Expanding that question from the department to the university, I mean  you   ve seen it evolve for gosh, 40 plus years here at Oklahoma State.  How in your opinion has the university changed and evolved?  We   ve gotten bigger. The fiefdoms have become more fiefdoms in that  sense. (Laughter) But I think we have a central administration now that  probably does not have the concept of the well being of everyone as  opposed to the well being of different small units. One of the things  that   s hard to do is to think about what   s the common good. Because  sometimes the common good is in conflict with the individual good or  what individuals or other groups need. There   s something bigger. And  we   ve not had that for awhile. I have great respect for Burns Hargis.  Burns has a common good mentality, but I   m not convinced that the  people he has to depend upon have that.  Jay Boggs used to always (laughs)   Jay was interesting. Jay was a good  administrator. Jay said he would meet with the deans, they would have a  Deans    Council meeting and they would all agree on what they were  going to do. Then, each one came back independently one by one to get  their special deal, that they really didn   t like this part. That   s a concept  that continues to work at OSU. That people will make a public statement  about what they agree with and then cut their small deals behind the  scene, and so therefore you don   t really get the change you need to have.  Earl, are you optimistic about the future of Oklahoma State University  under President Hargis    leadership?  I have a degree of optimism about it because I like Burns very much. I  think he has all the right attitudes and accolades. But being a person  coming from outside the university, not really knowing the one  component, the academic component of the university and depending  upon that from others, makes him vulnerable to things that he probably  doesn   t understand. Because one way you control people is don   t give  39  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  them all the information. (Laughs) That   s a very simple process. Only  give them the information that you want them to have.  Earl, can you share some special memories that you have of OSU in  your 40 years with the university? Maybe some personal highlights for  you, some milestones?  Personally, I think the real thing that hit me at the university was back in     70 when the black students left the campus in boycott. I was with them  every evening. I came and taught my courses, I did my research, and  then in the evening I went with the students. And that was driving back  and forth every night, getting home at 1 A.M. in the morning and being  with the students. At the end of that period, I was really touched by most  of the faculty at the time. Because I had a lot of faculty calling me and  telling me that they were supportive, they wanted to know what they  could do to help the students. They probably didn   t understand  everything about it, but they thought that since I was involved, they had  confidence in me. That if I was involved, there was some problem. That  was very very touching.  The one thing that really got to me and was really   as I was travelling in  the evening, there were two of us getting hate calls. One was Sam  Aubrey and the other one was me. Because Sam had dismissed the  basketball players. Sam Aubrey is a fine gentleman, he   s a member of  my church. We go to the same church together. I was and the two of us  were getting hate calls. I came home one night and George Odell was  sitting in my living room grading his papers with his gun in his lap.  Because I didn   t realize that, but there were some phone calls that came  to the house and Bernice answered them and it was some    blankety-blank  we gonna take care of that blankety-blank professor, we gonna  take care of him, we   ll be by the house.    So she called George, panicked  with the kids, George,    No don   t worry about it I   ll come by and grade  papers. But I   ll bring my gun just in case.    (Laughs) I got home, there  was George sitting there grading his papers. Me, being my positive self,  did not know the fear that Bernice had   we didn   t have cell phones in  those days to call me and tell me what   s going on. Having George there  and having faculty members who didn   t know me personally call me and  tell me that they appreciate what I was doing and then Bob Kamm also  told me he appreciated me being out there with the students. That was  very   he always told me that, every time he saw me he always said,     Earl, you did a good job. I appreciate you being out there.    That was  the touching part for me, very touching part.  Looking back on your OSU experience, and we   ve looked at several  aspects. What personal and professional accomplishments and  recognitions have been especially meaningful to you?  40  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Well, I think being inducted into the Oklahoma Higher Education Hall  of Fame was probably most touching because it   s recognition outside of  campus. Because most people on that committee that made the decision  are not OSU people, including some who were with the State Regents  office at the time. And I had worked with the State Regents for a long  time on a number of programs. So I   ve been involved with the State  Regents for a long time in terms of initiatives, the civil rights initiative at  the State Regents, their integration cases, I was always advisory to them  for a number of years. But that recognition meant a lot to me because it  goes beyond the small little area that I   m involved in.  Well Earl, think about this for a minute. How do you hope people will  remember Earl Mitchell?  (Laughs) Well, I hope people will remember me as the positive, jolly  person who always thought that people were good and that things are  going to be fine in the future. That I was always positive about  everything regardless of how low it was, I could always see a little light  some place. And I hope people remember me as that kind of person. Not  a gloom and doom bug guy. (Laughter)  You   re retired now, Earl. What   s on your bucket list? Anything else you  got there?  Well, no I don   t have any personal agenda other than the one thing I  need to do is I   ve started putting down some memoirs. I need to write  some things. These things I   m talking about here, I need to go into some  detail about a number of different things in terms of things that have  happened to me in my 40 years here. But I think there are a lot of things  about my family, growing up in New Orleans that I   d like to share with  people. So I need to write something. That   s mainly what I want to do.  And particularly about the family. I   ve been doing family history, a  family tree. I   m learning things about family and things, struggles that  some people have had, which I   d like to put down. I had a great aunt     see I   m probably one of the few people who has Muslims in the family,  Christians, and Jews. My grandkids are Jewish because my daughter-in-law  is Jewish. So we celebrate Hanukah. I just had my granddaughter   s  Bat Mitzvah a couple weeks ago. My grandson   s Bar Mitzvah in two  years. I had a great aunt who was a very devout Muslim. She taught me  about the Koran and Muslim life. So I learned a lot. And she was very  devout, very devout Muslim. So religious-wise those are the kinds of  things I   d like to share. She told me a lot of stories about sharecropping  when she was a little kid. What happened, moving around from different  parts of Mississippi and Louisiana, interesting stories she   s given me.  That   d be great.  41  Mitchell  Gill  Mitchell  Gill  Yes.  Earl, is there anything else we   ve left out? Anything you want to add?  I don   t think so.  Okay. We appreciate it. Thank you.  -------  -------
