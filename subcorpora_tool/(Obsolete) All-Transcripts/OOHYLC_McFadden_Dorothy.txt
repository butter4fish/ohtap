I liked to play games with boys.  Finchum Were you born on a farm or in town?  5  McFadden No farm. In town, in a little town. Beloit, Kansas, was a small town, but  was a county seat. It was a nice little town, I knew practically  everybody. I played for church when I was a young girl growing up.  That   s the way I made my spending money was playing for church,  because I was a good sight-reader. I started when I was five years old,  playing the piano.

McFadden I had to. Sue insisted I give up my car. She said if I was in an accident  I   d be blamed because of my age even if it wasn   t my fault.
