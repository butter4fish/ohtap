LIZ LUNDEEN:  This is July 30th and this is Liz Lundeen, and I&#8217;m interviewing Susan Sassman, and we&#8217;re here at the Creative Center in Greensboro where Susan is the executive director.  So I thought maybe we could just get started by me asking you to share a little bit about where you were born, your own life growing up, anything memorable about your family, if you have any siblings et cetera.  SUSAN SASSMAN:  I was born in January 1955 in Toronto, Canada.  I was the only girl in a family of three.  I had an older brother and a younger brother.  My mom was a stay at home mom, and it was the [19]50s and the [19]60s.  She raised the three of us.  She was a very traditional wife, did all the cooking, the laundry, the shopping.  My father went to work every day, &#8220;brought home the bacon.&#8221;  We lived in the suburbs.  We went on picnics.  Pretty standard, traditional growing up period.  Then when I was twelve years old we moved to Cleveland, Ohio.  My father was transferred and that was a huge leap.  I was now in junior high school, had a thick Canadian accent, was, always looked really young for my age.  So even when I went off to college at seventeen, I looked like I was about fourteen.  I&#8217;m pretty sheltered as the only girl in the family.  I was my father&#8217;s favorite and my mother&#8217;s favorite, which caused some issues with my two brothers.  They continued to act to get attention whether it was going through rehab or going to jail but lots of big drama, negative drama in their life.  The more they acted out in that direction, the more of a good girl I wanted to be, to please my parents and to balance out all of the crazy drama going on.  So I was a good student.  I was kind of shy.  I did what I was told, and my parents never abused me or spanked me or anything.  I just always took the high road.  I was the mediator in the family and the one to bring a smile to people&#8217;s faces.  So I got really good at being entertaining and really liked the security of going off to college to find a husband.  I was the first one to go to college in my family.  So when I left, my parents urged me to find a husband as quickly as possible, get out.  Don&#8217;t worry about the degree.  Get the &#8220;MRS degree&#8221; and find a nice guy who would take care of me and maybe get a degree, if I needed to get a degree, then do something where you can have something to fall back on in the event that your husband dies early.  So I chose home economics thinking that I could use those skills to decorate the nursery and to make the home prettier and do upholstery and make my own clothes and my children&#8217;s costumes and all that.  I was really skilled with a sewing machine.  So I grew up thinking that I would get a degree in home economics, find a nice guy, get married and then stay at home and raise children just like my mom did.  And that&#8217;s what I set about to do.  LL:  Can I just go back a little bit and ask, so moving to Cleveland, this would&#8217;ve been the early [19]60s?  SS:  1966.       LL:  Okay, mid-sixties.  What did you perceive about what was going on with all the social and political upheavals in the country?  Civil rights, the beginnings of &#8211;  SS:  Well, there were race riots going on in Cleveland at the time, and Mayor Stokes was in charge.  And personally I had never even seen a person of color, ever.  And so I was fascinated to move to Cleveland and to see black and brown people around me.  Fascinated, not scared.  I never did understand why black people and brown and white people would have issues because in my book it was the Catholics and the Protestants that were always at war.  And I was raised to not ever be thinking about dating or marrying a Catholic boy.  So consequently I only dated Catholic boys.  But didn&#8217;t get the whole race thing at all.  I was really young.  And in the late [19]60s I was still, I was in junior high school.  So I wasn&#8217;t quite aware politically of all the upheaval that was going on and [what] was to come.  And I of course never thought of any other way to live out my life except the one that had been set before me by my mother.  LL:  Do you remember anything &#8211; were the schools in Cleveland integrated by the time you entered?  SS:  No.  LL:  In high school?  SS:  No, not at all.  And I lived again in the suburbs.  And I&#8217;ll be going back again to my fortieth class reunion in a few weeks, and we&#8217;re going to walk through our old school and look at our lockers and play a little basketball and all that.  No, totally Caucasian school, middle/upper class.  So in my world, everybody was a middle class white person that was educated, and the women stayed at home and the men took care of them.  That was my picture.  Yeah.  LL:  So going off to college.  Where did you&#8212;  SS:  Southern Illinois University.  Started out in the field of dance.  Then realized I probably didn&#8217;t have a future as a dancer.  I wasn&#8217;t good enough.  Switched over to psychology, which was fascinating to me, but realized I would have to stay in college for a long, long time in order to do anything with a degree in psychology.  And I wanted to get out, the find a husband so I went into home economics.  When I was in high school, that was the era where our counselors would say to us if we were women, you basically have three choices.  You could be a secretary, a nurse, a teacher.  Which do you want to be?  And I mean I thought secretary, I can&#8217;t sit still that long, and I&#8217;m not that good of a typist.  Teacher children, teaching children is not my bag.  And nurse didn&#8217;t resonate with me at all, but those were the three choices.  And so I ended up like my mom helped me decide that because I was so skillful with my hands and clothing and had such a good eye for that that home ec, which they don&#8217;t even have anymore.    LL:  Right.  Right.  SS:  That was my degree.  So I got a bachelor&#8217;s degree in clothing and textiles and I met my husband when I was a freshman.  I was seventeen.  I met him at a party a few weeks after we started college.  We remained friends throughout college, never dated.  And then my senior year we started to date.  Now I've been married to him thirty-four years.  We have two kids.    We went from Cleveland, I went from Cleveland after I graduated from high school.  And I [had] secured a boyfriend in junior high school that remained with me throughout my high school days.  And then I went off to college and so did he.  I was saving myself for him.  So when he got out of college, and I got out of college we were supposed to get married.  But something went awry there.  And I ended up breaking up with him and then I ended up with [my husband.] So I didn&#8217;t have a lot of men in my life.  I really didn&#8217;t.  But I was definitely looking for that security.  I never for a moment imagined that I could take care of myself financially, not even in the cards, which is something I struggle with today at fifty-seven.  So went to college, found a husband, graduated, moved to North Carolina. And because my parents were moving here to start a business, they hired my boyfriend to work with them.  We moved in together.  It was the seventies.  Our parents were all very upset about that.  LL:  I was going to ask.  SS:  The living in sin part.  His parents just kind of cut the cord.    LL:  And where were his parents?  SS:  Chicago.  They were very disappointed in him, not in us but that he would do such a thing to such a lovely girl as me. What if I got pregnant, just the shame of it all, and they were heavily Catholic, heavily.  So&#8212;  LL:  And how was that with you and with your family having sort of thought through the, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to go to college going to get married, going to have security.&#8221;  Was the living together before getting married, did that seem like a rupture for you in terms of&#8212;  SS:  It was hard for my parents to swallow, but they were trying to think of themselves as kind of hip and cool whereas my in-laws were not.  They were very staunch Catholics, and my parents since we lived in the same town and we had followed them down here and were part of the business and this obviously was the man that was going to be their future, provide their future grandchildren whatever it took.  LL:  That was acceptable.  Yeah.  SS:  Yeah, so we got married and this was the late [19]70s and then in the early [19]80s we started having children.  That was a turning point for me because I finally realized that the pedestal that I'd been sitting on wasn&#8217;t so high.  That suddenly I was giving up everything, it seemed like, my body, my income, the friends that I had.  I was at home with a child, twenty-four-seven, kind of winging it.  And I was trying to keep the house up and didn&#8217;t have any plans to do anything with my home ec degree.  I think I made a lot of stuffed animals during that time.  And then the baby was born and we go along and then another baby shows up.  Mid-eighties, now I&#8217;m really feeling it.  My husband is going to work every day.  I&#8217;m at home with two small children.  We don&#8217;t have a lot of money.  I'd given up career options.  I've given up all that and I stumbled on a NOW meeting, a girlfriend called me up.    LL:  So this was in&#8212;  SS:  [19]85.  [She] called me and said, &#8220;You will not believe what I have stumbled upon.&#8221;  This nest of women who are very vocal, and they&#8217;re bright, and they&#8217;re odd.  It&#8217;s like they don&#8217;t care about fashion or their hair, and I&#8217;m like really?  What kind of people are these?  So we went to a meeting and I was hooked.  I mean, I walked in the door and they were showing Killing Me Softly.  I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve ever seen that film.  But it was my turning point.  Having these two kids, fighting with my husband, not having enough money, carrying extra weight.  Having no options for a career and not feeling like the greatest mom because I was sleep deprived, and I couldn&#8217;t bear for my children to cry so I would always hold them.  I was holding them, always nursing them.  And I just wasn&#8217;t prepared for all that.  When I found the NOW chapter, all these light bulbs started going on in my head, and I started thinking about the way the world uses women, how they objectify women, their body parts, how we have to strive to be the Barbie doll.  All the sexual ads that are running around us subliminally all the time that I had never noticed.  Never noticed.  I was happy to be a pretty young female with a father who adored me and a husband that was taking care of me.  And then I read Betty Friedan&#8217;s book, and I realized that this whole pedestal thing had a downside.  And that I was cutting myself off all the time from my own skills and burying myself into the identity of being Mrs. Sassman.  And that was, I was more and more unhappy.  My depression was setting in.  And at some point, I think when I was about forty, it all came crashing down.  I jut couldn&#8217;t get out of bed.  I was so depressed.  I couldn&#8217;t bear it.  I walked around the house.  I knew I had to get a job.  My kids were like ten and five or something, ten and seven.  And I was walking around the house saying, &#8220;Would you like fries with that?&#8221;  &#8220;Would you like fries with that?&#8221;  I could only imagine myself working at McDonald&#8217;s.  It was really a bad scene.  I didn&#8217;t get out of bed for three months.  I don&#8217;t even know who took care of my children during that time.  I really don&#8217;t.  But&#8212;  LL:  And what, had you talked, so you said when your husband was working, he was the breadwinner.  Was there any discussion of you ever working especially if times were tight financially?  SS:  No, no.  He wanted to be able to take care of us.    LL: Right.  Take care of you; take care of the children.    SS:  Yeah, his ego demanded that.   LL:  What about when you started to get depressed?  What were things like between the two of you?  Was he&#8212;  SS:  He didn&#8217;t pursue it.  I remember saying to him one time, &#8220;Do you not notice how depressed I am or do you notice but you just don&#8217;t care?  Which is it?&#8221;  Because either way he was screwed.  There was a third answer in there, which I never came upon until I went to therapy, but it was, I notice but I don&#8217;t know what to do with it.  That was the answer.  I do recall though as soon as both my kids were off in school, off in kindergarten, I had this like ah-ha thing, like wow.  What can I do now?  I've got this talent that sewing machine, clothing and stuff.  And my kids are in school half a day.  They were in Montessori school.  And a man approached me and said, &#8220;You are so talented.  How about if I invest $5,000 in your talent; we create a business together, called Sassman Designs.  You design maternity wear&#8221;&#8212;this is what happened.  I designed maternity wear because all the maternity stuff was so lame in the [19]80s.  It was like the word baby with an arrow and little Peter Pan collars and little pleats and little puff sleeves, and I was becoming a, I was a feminist now.  I mean, I couldn&#8217;t, blah.  I couldn&#8217;t bear the thought of people wearing that stuff.  We&#8217;re not babies.  We&#8217;re having a baby.  So I started designing really sleek looking evening gowns and playwear and cool stuff.  It took off, and I had a couple of factories that were manufacturing these clothes for me, and I was shipping them around the country to boutiques, high-end boutiques.  And not really making any money, just breaking even, but going to New York regularly, buying fabrics and trims and buttons and coming back and designing prototypes in my home with my kids running around and getting them out into stores.  They were in magazines; they were on runways.  I was like wow.  This is great.    And then we, we weren&#8217;t, I wasn&#8217;t getting along with my business partner.  Times were getting really tense.  And then and I was taking karate class.  My whole family was taking karate class.  I had taken a test in Newsweek about if I was going to do some kind of exercise what would be best suited for my personality, and it came back martial arts, which I thought was hilarious because I&#8217;m so prissy.  I&#8217;m such a girl.  I was baton twirler, and I was head pom-pom girl in college, and I was little miss homemaker, and I loved to have parties at my house and be &#8220;the hostess with the mostest.&#8221;  And gosh, that seems like a long time ago.  But all of that has worked its way into my present life now.  So I forgot where I was going with that.    LL:  Can I ask a little bit about NOW, about your experience?  So you went to a meeting in [19]85?  Did you have girlfriends that you would talk about sort of being at home or having children or sort of the troubles of&#8212;?  SS:  Yes.  LL:  Before you went to the NOW meeting?  You said a girlfriend called you to say let&#8217;s go.  I&#8217;m just kind of curious what discussions were sort of going on between you and your female friends.  SS:  We were all getting together with our small children running around and complaining about the same things in our life.  That we weren&#8217;t feeling valued enough, that we were overworked, underpaid, overlooked.  Our husbands were the lucky ones because they were out there in the real world, and they were getting paid for doing things like being on the phone and talking, and we weren&#8217;t getting paid for anything.  And we bitched and moaned about how can we change these men to be more emotionally connected to us and to want to hear what our struggles were and they didn&#8217;t.  When the husbands came home from work, we would push them into their arms and go, &#8220;I&#8217;m out of here.&#8221;  So it was like tag team parenting and resentment that was building up.    So finally I looked at five or six of us one day and said, &#8220;You know we need a therapist.  And we can&#8217;t afford one so maybe we can find one therapist to treat all of us and do group therapy since we&#8217;re all bitching about the same things.&#8221;  So that&#8217;s exactly what happened.  We went and got somebody who created a group, and we all worked through our issues at the same time.  That&#8217;s when I found the NOW chapter.  So things were starting to happen.  I was in therapy.  I met the feminists, the NOW group.  I very quickly became president of that group.  I don&#8217;t know why because I think I was new and fresh and had some skills and they were tired.  They were trying to push through the, it was seventy cents on the dollar at that time, the Equal Rights Amendment.  I quickly ascended to be the president and started going to national conferences.  It was just lighting me, it lit me up like nothing ever did.  And then I would come home and tell my husband, &#8220;I&#8217;m not ironing your shirts anymore.  I want to take care, I want to change the oil in the car.  I want to know how a refrigerator works.  I want you to make Sunday dinner.&#8221;  And he was like, &#8220;Uh-uh.  I am the boy and you are the girl.&#8221;  I think he called me a name like a selfish, I don&#8217;t know, I think he used the word dike at one point.  I was freaked right out that he had called me a name.  And then of course everybody, I became a very strident feminist at that point, and I was at the News and Record all the time.  &#8220;This is what the feminists think about what is going on in this town right now, blah, blah, blah.&#8221;  And they would be calling me and interviewing me if there was something happening.  I loved it.  But I was angry; I was angry.  And I was in my thirties, and I fell into the, oh karate class.    My whole family started taking karate and so I was getting stronger, physically stronger, emotionally, intellectually.  I was a huge growth period for me.  And then my business partner tried to strangle me one day.  He was manic-depressive.  And he grabbed me around the throat, and he squeezed and he was 240 pounds, six foot four and a manic-depressive.  He took me down to the floor and said, &#8220;I should just fucking kill you.&#8221;  And I did nothing.  I did nothing, and I was a karate student.  I just couldn't even believe&#8212;and that reminds me of how many women are abused by people that they know and love and that you just become paralyzed at that point.  So the business ended; the friendship ended, and I got on the stick about I&#8217;m not taking this anymore.  I am not going to be a woman on a pedestal.  So I became pretty strident and angry.  I credit my husband for staying with me during those years.  I just said men are the root of all evil.  The wars, let&#8217;s look at the wars.  Let&#8217;s look at the economy.  Let&#8217;s look at this, the abuse of little girls.  It&#8217;s like men, men, men, men, men, and I started holding my husband accountable for all men of all time.  It was hard.  I mean I'd love for somebody to interview him about that.    LL:  See how that was.  SS:  Yeah.    LL:  So [you&#8217;re] in Greensboro right, you&#8217;re in the South, what was the reception around the NOW meetings.  What did feminists, was it&#8212;?  I imagine it was used quite a lot as a derogatory term, but you said you were called up by the newspapers as sort of the representative.  So what was that like?  SS:  Yeah.  I liked that.  I wished that I had been more informed.  And I know what happened.  While I was at home raising children and designing clothing and I was in the NOW chapter, a lot of times people would call me and say to the area, I need an attorney.  Can you help me?  I looked in the yellow pages under women&#8217;s leadership or issues, and your name is here because I had the hotline at my house.  So I kept picking up the phone every day, more and more women wanting more and more help.  I thought I can&#8217;t do this by myself.  I need a team of people to help me.  I can&#8217;t spend all day long chasing down information for all these folks.  We need like a women&#8217;s center.    That&#8217;s how the idea of the Women&#8217;s Resource Center was birthed.  And I was in therapy because I was depressed.  This guy had tried to kill me, blah, blah, blah.  My husband was mad because I was becoming this person that he didn&#8217;t know.  And my therapist said, &#8220;If you could do anything in the world, what would it be?&#8221;  I said, &#8220;I would work at a women&#8217;s center.&#8221;  He said, &#8220;What would that look like?&#8221;  &#8220;I said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know but there&#8217;d be a lot of women around.  And we&#8217;d be changing the world, at least our community, maybe not the world.  And nobody would be telling us what to do.  We would know what to do and we would have all these women and everybody would have different skills.  One woman would know how to change a tire and another one would know how to make a turkey dinner and another one would know how to give birth under water.  And we would all come together in this place that would be on the busline and it would be free and we&#8217;d have an office for NOW and an office for the Commission on the Status for Women and the YWCA.  It would be like a wheel with spokes.&#8221;  I could visualize it, but my father came to me one day and said, &#8220;Stop talking about it.  Here&#8217;s five hundred dollars go do it.&#8221;  So I got three girlfriends together and I said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s make a women&#8217;s resource center.&#8221;  And we did and it&#8217;s down the street.      LL:  And this is in the [19]90s.    SS:  [19]93.  And I was just coming out of my depression.  I started on anti-depressants at that point.  And I think about thirty seconds after I took the first Prozac, I was cured.  I was like okay.  I&#8217;m ready.  Launched into the Women&#8217;s Resource Center for the next eight years, lived and breathed it and visited all the women&#8217;s centers in the state of North Carolina.  Took the best pieces of each one, brought it back, got the media on it, got the volunteer pool happening, got women with money to put money into it and it became this women&#8217;s beacon of light, which was only bought into by the mainstream because it wasn&#8217;t radical feminists.  LL:  I was, yeah, I was going to ask about that.  So again being in the South, what kinds of things couldn&#8217;t you do at the Women&#8217;s Center?  SS:  You couldn&#8217;t take a stand on abortion, and I took a lot of flak for that.  We needed to be non-political and non-religious.  And that was the hard one.  We encouraged women to make choices about their life, but we didn&#8217;t make a statement about pro-choice or pro-life.  We wanted all women in the community to feel welcome there, all races, ages, colors, religions and political leanings, and we stuck to that mission, and that was hard for me because I was one to step up and make a statement.  LL:  And had you been active in a pro-choice movement?  SS:  Oh yeah, yeah.  I'd interviewed for jobs to run Planned Parenthood.  I was dragging my kid to Washington for marches on Washington.  I was there when [President] Clinton was inaugurated, on a bus, all night, on TV, organizing the troops, grassroots organizer.  I mean, I was like the face of feminism at that point in the early [19]90s.  And when the Women&#8217;s Center took off, it took off with a vengeance because it wasn&#8217;t radical.  It was&#8212;  LL:  You had to &#8211;.  SS:  My way of selling feminism to Greensboro was to open up the Resource Center and it was fabulous.  And now a woman gave us $800,000; we matched it.  We built a two million dollar building.  We serve 10,000 women a year.  They start businesses; they get scholarships.  It&#8217;s awesome, awesome.  Out of the eleven hundred non-profits in our area, it ranks second after Hospice for earmarked donations because people want women to succeed.  And if women aren&#8217;t happy, no one is happy.  And I wanted that on a bumper sticker on everybody&#8217;s car in Greensboro.  I mean we are the glue to society.  We are the ones who are taking care of the disenfranchised and our girlfriends and the men in our lives and the churches and the schools.  We&#8217;re doing the second shift; we&#8217;re getting paid less still.  So what&#8217;s not to love about women.  Men love to be in the company of women; women love to be in the company of women.  Children love to be in the company of women.  So I&#8217;m just a huge advocate for women.  I would&#8217;ve been a great lesbian.    LL:  Well, that brings me to another question in terms of both NOW and the Women&#8217;s Center, what, how racially, ethnically diverse were these spaces or organizations and also in terms of sexuality, was it a friendly space for lesbians?  SS:  Yeah, yeah.  Black and white, yeah, gay and straight.  It was a bastion for everybody.  It was a microcosm of the community, and we made sure we went after the lesbian population to come and join us.  And the Asian and the Latina, we had a nice cross section.  But these were, that was in the early days, and then it got harder and harder to fund the Women&#8217;s Center because we were trying to fund things like self-esteem classes, r&#233;sum&#233; writing, technology, and the money was more available for the women who were beaten and raped and bloody.  So the more pitiful you could present yourself as a nonprofit, the more likely you&#8217;d be to get money.    So we started looking to individuals in the community to support us and what happened was the women were not stepping forward at some point.  The men were.  The men with the deep pockets, and the men who had a better idea of how to run things, more like a corporate thing.  So the structure that we had set up was like a circular leadership where there were four of us and we took turns running the place and we all crossed over.  Every two years we would hand the torch to the next person.  Well, when the men came in with their deep pockets, they said, &#8220;We&#8217;ll give you the money to keep running but you&#8217;ve got to stop this silly thing that you&#8217;re doing.  You need to pick one person to become the director and they stay that way forever.  You need to have this go on and this go on and no more of this girlie stuff.  You don&#8217;t run around barefoot, drinking coffee, helping women in the street.  You get a board of directors; you play by the rules; we need more bylaws.&#8221;  LL:  And a board of directors.  SS:  Mm-hmm, oh yeah, and then at one point I looked at my girlfriends.  I started to get depressed again.  And I couldn&#8217;t figure out why.  I thought either I needed to leave the Women&#8217;s Center or I needed to leave my husband.  I knew it was one or the other.  I didn&#8217;t know where my sadness was coming from, but those were the two things that were so big in my life.  And I went away to something called the Landmark Forum for a weekend, and I did a lot of internal searching and when I came out, I realized that if the Women&#8217;s Center was going to grow a penis, I wasn&#8217;t going to do it anymore.  So that&#8217;s what I told them.  I said if the men are going to run it, I&#8217;m out of here and so I left.    And for five years I wouldn&#8217;t come back and I wouldn&#8217;t go in.  And the men ran it and it changed a little bit.  And now it&#8217;s more of a place where the wealthier white women fund it.  And they serve the poorer black population &#8211;  LL:  Interesting.  SS:  Who are need help with housing and a little more desperate than what it had been imagined in the beginning, which was a think-tank for all women who could come and relate to each other on all levels and get what they needed out of it.  For that I&#8217;m sad, but it&#8217;ll morph some more.  It&#8217;ll be around forever I think, and it&#8217;ll be what it needs to be.  The reality of the community will probably dictate what it needs to be.    LL:  So your vision of having it be a center for a lot of women&#8217;s organizations like NOW having an office &#8211;.  I imagine it to be more palatable to the general community to stay away from NOW, which is not necessarily a radical organization, but is that the case?  Is that why that could [not] come to fruition?  SS:  No, I think all those people that I was trying to tap &#8211; Planned Parenthood, NOW, the Commission &#8211; they all had offices already.  They didn&#8217;t want to break their leases in hopes that this would take off, and we couldn&#8217;t just give them space because we needed the income.  So I think there was some of that going on.  And maybe we didn&#8217;t need to be blended with all of them.  But I wanted all the women&#8217;s groups together, to come together.  There&#8217;s something about that that made me smile.    LL:  Right.  SS:  This is like a women&#8217;s center over here.  It&#8217;s fifty people, but it&#8217;s forty-two women, and they&#8217;re all passionate and creative and opinionated and dramatic.  It&#8217;s a women&#8217;s center for sure with a few men sprinkled in.    LL:  Yeah, so can you say a little bit about how you got here [the Creative Center in Greensboro].  So what was the transition like from leaving the Women&#8217;s Center?  SS:  I left the Women&#8217;s Center for what I just, the reason I just told you, and I felt like the women&#8217;s presence was diminishing and I couldn&#8217;t stay and watch it.  And it was a good thing that I left because the following year, three of our four parents died.    LL:  Oh my.  SS:  So it was like every four months somebody&#8217;s mother or father was dying in my family.  And I was the one who was sent to go and be with them for the end of life, which is another one of my passions.  The life celebrations upon your death and how to remember people.  And it was good that I was available to do that, I think.  It was good for them and it was good for me.  And then I bopped around and did some special event work and I ran a costume shop for a while with my clothing and textile thing and create&#8212;.  I always wanted to blend my creative juices with a nonprofit spin.  But I could never, there needed to be a creative center in Greensboro that I could run, but there wasn&#8217;t one.  I wasn&#8217;t going to start one.  I'd already started five businesses along the way and some of them were nonprofit.  I went and ran an agency called Sports Dreams for girls, thirteen-year-old girls who were losing their excitement about sports because they were getting excited about boys.  And they felt like they couldn&#8217;t do both.  LL:  Had to choose.  SS:  And they felt like they had to choose.  And it was always going to be boys.  So I had this after school program that kept the girls, it was called Girls in the Game.  And I ran that for two or three years.  I just started different businesses, moved around.  My kids grew up; they left.  And then two years ago I was diagnosed with cancer, third degree, or stage three esophageal cancer.  So I thought, oh no that&#8217;s not good.  And it has as really low survival rate.  So I took a year off and I did chemo and radiation; I did surgery.  I went to Houston, they had an esophagectomy, lost forty pounds, was fed through a tube in my stomach, regained my health and my joie and came out of that thinking, &#8220;I think I should go to culinary school because I really love food now like I never did before.&#8221;  Because if you go for a year and don&#8217;t eat, you have a lot of fantasies about, mmm, whatever.  But then this job popped up.  My girlfriend came and said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re in for this but the Creative Center needs a director.&#8221;  And I said, &#8220;Yep, that&#8217;s my job.&#8221;  And she said, &#8220;Well, there are twenty-two people applying.&#8221;  I said, &#8220;That&#8217;s fine.  You can interview them if you like.  But this is my job.&#8221;  She said, &#8220;Well, good luck.&#8221;  I said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t need any luck.  This is my job.&#8221;  And I talked myself right through it, and I met with all the board of directors and I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m your girl.&#8221;  Not only am I your person [but I] will work really hard for a little bit of money because I always have. And part of that is I never believed that I could make enough money to support myself.  And as I watch all my girlfriends divorce their husbands and have to go out into the world and they grew up in the [19]50s too with the same fear of, &#8220;Oh my god, what if he leaves me.&#8221;  I've watched them take, in fact I've been one to help them leave and take flight.  And I've got kind of a reputation that once you meet Susan it&#8217;s only a matter of time before you leave your husband because they&#8217;re unhappy.  LL:  That&#8217;s a good reason.  SS:  But I couldn&#8217;t I support myself, I don&#8217;t think.  I don&#8217;t know.  I don&#8217;t know.  But what&#8217;s been beautiful for me is that my husband, because he filled that traditional role, for the last thirty-four years I've been able to go out and change the world in so many ways.  And that&#8217;s been a gift that I could stay at home with my kids and that they grew up to be fabulous people and put them in Montessori school and all that and worked around the edges and then took off in a radical direction and then came back and figured a better way to sell feminism and then to come and blend it with the creative arts and all that.  It&#8217;s been beautiful.  Now at fifty-seven, I&#8217;ve got the cancer thing behind me, and I&#8217;m in the perfect place and I&#8217;m a softer feminist now.  I dress more like a hippy now, like a flower child, not power suits and not aggressively down at the News and Record pounding on their door.    But I remember when they opened Hooters in Greensboro.  I got all my women together and said, &#8220;Okay here&#8217;s the plan.  We&#8217;re going to dress in black and we&#8217;re going to go in the middle of the night and we&#8217;re going to get a big ladder and we&#8217;re going to go up and we&#8217;re going to cover the signs that says &#8216;Hooters&#8217; with another one that says &#8216;Peckers&#8217;.  We&#8217;re going to have the News and Record there about and yeah, boys how does it feel to have a restaurant named after your genitals?  How dare you name a restaurant after our breasts?  Where do you get away with that and who&#8217;s the guy that came up with this plan?&#8221;  That kind of stuff.  LL:  How did that go?  SS:  We never did it.  We laughed about it.  We never did it.  We couldn&#8217;t&#8212;  LL:  It still could be done.  SS:  It could be.  We never had enough money to get the sign made.    LL:  Yeah, exactly.  SS:  My next-door neighbor was good friends with Barbara and George Bush so they would come down here on Air Force One and have lunch, and I would be trying to rally the women together and picket the next-door neighbor because we were anti-Bush and all that kind of stuff, just fun radical stuff to do.    LL:  Yeah, so you&#8217;ve talked a lot about the sort of general vicinity Greensboro as well as your own family.  I&#8217;m just curious, what was your reaction to sort of what&#8217;s going on in Washington and the political changes there.  I mean you&#8217;ve really found feminism as the rise of the New Right, and this huge backlash culture is really developing.  So I&#8217;m curious as to what that was like?  SS:  [Big sigh]  Roe v Wade, I've been a big fan of that, and I've certainly had enough experience holding the hands of my girlfriends who&#8217;ve gone through abortions and I have as well.  And so there&#8217;s always that threat, and I&#8217;m sad that the X and Y generation are so cavalier about that that oh we&#8217;ll always have that.  I&#8217;m not so sure.    I became an American citizen in order to vote for Barack Obama.  I had been in the States all that time since I was twelve but always held onto my Canadian citizenship just in case I needed to run across the border.  LL:  To get away, yeah, absolutely.  SS:  I&#8217;m a Democrat.  My husband is a Libertarian, and I feel like I&#8217;m very tolerant of a lot of political and religious beliefs, but the radical right does scare me quite a bit.  I&#8217;m at the point now at fifty-seven that I&#8217;m not going to be out on the streets probably.  It&#8217;s too hot.  I&#8217;m too tired.  I&#8217;m too old, but I love to see like when the occupy movement came about or when the, you see the younger generation take to the streets, it lights up my heart just like it did when I was in my thirties.  I love to see that.  I still really like Barack Obama.  I can&#8217;t imagine anybody else doing a better job, given what he was handed and the way he thinks about women and Michelle thinks about women.  I&#8217;m his supporter, and we&#8217;ll have to just see how it goes.  I could get back out in the streets but probably if I lost this job, I'd go to Planned Parenthood or try to revive the NOW chapter.  I think there&#8217;s another&#8211;  When I almost died having cancer, I thought this is what pulled me through.  There were a lot of things I think, but one of them was I've got a couple more revolutions to throw especially this end of life stuff, the way we die.  [Jack] Kevorkian is my hero.  I want to make an impact on that, on the scene.  When I am in my seventies or in my sixties, I can imagine, because special events has become a part of my fabric, that I could throw some really great funerals for people.  I think I&#8217;m probably going to go more in that direction in helping the boomers live out their life in a way that really feels great to them.  But feminism is still my favorite thing to think about and talk about and Gloria Steinem&#8212;  LL:  Hero?  SS:  She&#8217;s my hero.  LL:  So what is it that if you had say, this would be a tough question, what is sort of at the root that gets you going with all these causes.  Obviously you had some very personal connections to getting into feminism, but I mean in a way, that&#8217;s connected to your activities here.  It&#8217;s connected to your motivation to want to sort of help people live out the end of life.  I mean what is at the core?  [What] do you think motivates you?  SS:  Yeah, fighting for the underdog.  I think at some point when I stopped being so shy and started coming into my own, which is in my thirties when I found feminism truly, was my biggest light that ever flipped on.  And had I not been a mother at the time, the timing was perfect.  My depression was setting in.  This new idea was presented to me.  From that point forward, and karate too, doing six years of karate and becoming a brown belt and after that, that experience to be able to push myself to the point where I remember getting on an elevator and thinking, a couple strange, or one strange guy on an elevator, kind of looked at me and I thought, &#8220;Yeah, make my day buddy.  You know like just even try to touch me.  I&#8217;ll kill you.&#8221;  I love that feeling.  Just really, I realized my strength and my power I think that I, that I was so passionate about certain things that I could move people.  I could rally the troops easily because I had this enthusiasm about me, and a sense of humor about it too that wasn&#8217;t off-putting.  It would entice people into the game.  So if there&#8217;s a new idea out there, I might be tapped to be the one to sell it.  And rallying the troops and connecting the dots and putting in place people around me that can do things I can&#8217;t do.  Together that was a really powerful potion, and many people have come to me and said, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry you&#8217;re an agnostic because if you ever believed in Jesus the way you believed in feminism or the art world or gun control, boy would we be lucky to have you at our church.&#8221;  Because I can really sell the hell out of something that I&#8217;m passionate about to the point where, I mean people don&#8217;t even know what hit them.  They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Sign me up.&#8221;  So I need to use that to help people that can&#8217;t do it.  And people that are dying deserve to die properly I think, and women that are underserved, I can help that.  I know I can.  I can go to the media.  I can help them personally on a small level if you need a doctor or a couch or a glass eye or something.  I worked at the Women&#8217;s Resource Center for a decade.  I am the resource gal.  I am not hesitant to pick up the phone to ask the mayor for something.  Well, he&#8217;s my best friend, but he wasn&#8217;t always my best friend.  And so I've got a huge network in the gay community, the art community the senior community and the community at large.  I've been here thirty years; I've mouthed off enough and mellowed out. And the fact that I&#8217;m a cancer patient is even better because they went through a year going, &#8220;Poor Susan, she&#8217;s going to die.&#8221;  I&#8217;m not dying.  I have a few more revolutions to throw.  So voom, back comes my energy and I will.  If things go awry in my own hometown, I&#8217;m probably not going to go across the country and campaign for anybody, but it&#8217;s there.  It could be, that light could come again.  LL:  So with that, and I think you alluded to the X and Ys sort of taking for granted things like the right to choose.  Right.    SS:  Yeah.  LL:  I think we&#8217;ve gotten to a place where feminism is a dirty word, right, among people of my generation.  So what would you say, I mean, taking lessons from your path, you found a way to sell feminism at the Women&#8217;s Center, right?  What would you tell young aspiring feminists who don&#8217;t necessarily want to call themselves that?  SS:  Yeah, I guess you have to find yourself another word.  Is activist a bad word?  LL:  Depends who you ask I suppose.  Activist about what, right?   SS:  Yeah, activist for women&#8217;s issues is the way I present myself sometimes.  I&#8217;m a community activist; my strength is in women&#8217;s issues.  That&#8217;s kind of what, I don&#8217;t use the word feminist very often just for that reason.  I don&#8217;t even see the NOW chapter around anymore.  I don&#8217;t see Planned Parenthood saying much.  I don&#8217;t see the Commission on the Status for Women anymore.  So who is the &#8211;  Who is spearheading in Greensboro for women?  I mean it&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s an equal playing field.  I don&#8217;t know.  And people have asked me to be on the board of some of those things. But boards are not my thing.  I'd rather do public speaking about it but, or grassroots organizing.  There&#8217;s got to be one coming down the pike, and I don&#8217;t know what the young women&#8212;my daughter, she is a feminist, but she doesn&#8217;t spend any of her time or energy in trying to keep that alive or promoting the agenda.  She&#8217;s thirty-one, lives in Charleston.  Your time is coming, where the rubber will hit the road, and maybe you&#8217;ll call on the senior sages who have been there for a little advice.  Just like when I listen to Gloria Steinem and her life, she&#8217;s got a lot of wisdom in there. She&#8217;s calmed down a lot.  She got married.  How about that?  LL:  Yeah, who knew.  SS:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle.  Right.  That&#8217;s a good one to ponder.  I&#8217;ll have to think more about what that&#8217;s going to look like or how I would advise you.  I would go quietly into the night.  I wouldn't go storming.  It scares people.  You have to be smart about it and you have to use some honey to get people in.  I'd like to be in a think tank with you and your girlfriends and the women&#8217;s studies people to see how are you going to sell it to the mainstream, to the average bear.  LL:  Yeah, I think it&#8217;s a tough question.  SS:  It is.  LL:  Especially when you teach young college students right, and they say, &#8220;Women&#8217;s movement, that&#8217;s in the past.&#8221;  And you say, &#8220;No, no it&#8217;s still going and it needs to keep going.&#8221;   SS:  Yes, yes.  LL:  That actually brings me into another question just to ask about.  So things really clicked for you in the [19]80s.    SS:  Yeah.  LL:  Did you feel sort of when you found feminism as though you were a part of a longer history.  You mentioned Gloria Steinem when you were in college and everything, Roe v Wade, ERA, [19]72, so did you feel a part of that longer history or was it sort of&#8212;  SS:  Oh yeah it opened up so much to me.  I had no idea and what is it, August 26th, women&#8217;s right to vote, right.  Women&#8217;s equality day, when women got the right to vote in 1920.  So when I was running the NOW chapter, I was also at the Women&#8217;s Resource Center.  Every August 26th, I would dress up all these women in 1920s attire because I have a girlfriend that owns a costume shop.  And we&#8217;d go downtown.  And we&#8217;d stop traffic, and we&#8217;d have these little cards that we&#8217;d hand out to all the drivers that said meet us at five o&#8217;clock for champagne at this restaurant on this street with all the other women in this city to celebrate the fact that we have the right to vote and don&#8217;t take it lightly.  We&#8217;d hand them out and the news would come down and cover it.  And take your daughter to work day, we always did a big thing around that.  I don&#8217;t see any of that happening anymore.  It makes me sad, and I&#8217;m too busy to do it here.  It&#8217;s too much of a sidetrack.  If I ever got too passionate about what&#8217;s going on with the sex trade and young girls and stuff, that&#8217;s a rabbit hole that I don&#8217;t know that I could go down because I don&#8217;t want to touch that anger again that I lived through in the [19]80s when I realized how much men are responsible for the ills of the world.  Now I don&#8217;t hold my husband accountable anymore for all of it.    LL:  Well, is there anything else that you&#8217;d&#8217; like to add or&#8212;  SS:  I do have a, if you want another name of a person that I think you would love to interview, her name is Jennifer Byrd.  She&#8217;s a Ph.D. in women&#8217;s studies.  She&#8217;s a feminist here in town.  A girlfriend of mine, drinking buddy.  LL:  Is it B-I or B-Y&#8212;  SS:  It&#8217;s B-I-R-D.  Jennifer Bird, Dr. Bird.  We call her Jay Byrd.  I&#8217;ll get you her email.  She teaches women&#8217;s studies and religion.  I just think she&#8217;d just add a lot of color to your interviews.  Yeah, I appreciate being able to rehash this because it&#8217;s something that really is a huge part of my life.    LL:  Yeah, I can tell.  SS:  Huge, huge and I&#8217;m just so proud to be a feminist, and I wouldn&#8217;t take any of it back.  So&#8212;  LL:  Well, it&#8217;s been inspiring.  I had no idea all the things that went on in Greensboro.  And it sounds like you were at the root of a lot of it.    SS:  I was, I was on a lot of it.  Couldn&#8217;t get enough of it.  I do that, I dive in pretty hard when I find something I really like.  It&#8217;s never been Jesus but&#8212;you never know what could happen.  LL:  All right.  I think that&#8217;s a good end to the interview.  Thanks so much.  SS:  All right.
