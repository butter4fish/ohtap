 Finchum Today is April 25, 2016. My name is Tanya Finchum, and I   m with Oklahoma State University. Today, I am in Clearview, Oklahoma, Okfuskee County, and this is part of our Cowboys in Every County project. I appreciate being here with Shirley Ann Ballard-Nero, so thank you for having me today.  Nero Thank you for coming.  Finchum Let   s begin with learning a little bit about you. When and where were you born?  Nero I was born in Clearview, Oklahoma. I was born on December 15, 1949. I was born at home in rural Clearview, Oklahoma. My parents owned a forty-acre farm, and I am the first of three girls. My parents were, I guess you could say back then, quite elderly when I was born. (Laughs) My dad was fifty, my mom was thirty-eight, and they were married for a while, and they didn   t think they were going to have children, but they always had children around their house. Nieces and nephews always stayed, and all of a sudden, they had me, and it was a surprise, and then within three and a half years, they had two more girls.  I used to call my dad Uncle Roy. His name was Roy Robert Ballard, so I was born Shirley Ann Ballard, and because I was the first one, they couldn   t decide on a name. They thought about calling me Roberta, and naming me Roy, after my dad Roy. They didn   t like that name, and my mama   s name was Mary Ann, so they gave me the middle name of Ann, after my mom. I don   t know where they came up with the name Shirley. I think one of the neighbors had a daughter that was named Shirley, and maybe they came up with that to give me the name Shirley, but I   m sure glad they didn   t call me Roberta. (Laughs) So that   s   and I was born at home.  Finchum If your dad   s was Roy, who was your mother? 5  Nero My mother   s name was Mary Ann.  Finchum Oh, Mary Ann.  Nero Her maiden name was Johnson. My mom was born in 1912 in Clearview, and she stayed in Clearview until she passed away, so she never left Clearview. My dad was born in Greenwood, Arkansas, in 1899 and moved to Clearview in 1909. After he was grown, I guess about eighteen or nineteen, I   m not sure, but he left and went to Kansas City for a while. Played with one of the   he was really good in baseball, so he played with one of the black leagues in Kansas City, and stayed there for a while. Then he came back to Clearview, and he stayed here and farmed a forty-acre farm until he got sick, but they   ve both since passed away.  Finchum What team did he play for?  Nero He played for the Kansas City   let me think. I   ll come back to that a little later when you ask me, and I   ll have to remember   Monarchs   Finchum Okay.  Nero The Kansas City Monarchs.  Finchum And did he do that very long?  Nero He did. I don   t know exactly how many. It was a few years, and he had two brothers that also played up there with them in Kansas City.  Finchum He came from Arkansas. Were his parents from Arkansas or had they   .  Nero They weren   t from Arkansas. I think they moved there and stayed there maybe ten or fifteen years, but I think they   one of them, he met his   his father met his wife in Greenwood, Arkansas, and I think she was from South Carolina. They have some really deep roots in Greenwood, Arkansas. They were the Norwood family, his mother was, and they have quite a history back there in Arkansas. In fact, the Norwood family has a whole history book written about them. They were quite   very good singers, and his grandfather actually served as a guide for hunters, prestigious people back in Arkansas. They have pictures of him serving as the guide. There was people that hunted bear and things like that. So they were pretty well-known back then. In fact, this summer we went back and looked for the cemetery where some of them are buried. But they came here in 1909, and some of them are buried here in Clearview in this North Fork Cemetery.  Finchum What brought them here? 6  Nero Well, they   you know, Oklahoma is one of those states that in the early 1900s, there was a development of all-black towns in Oklahoma, and a lot of people were coming here for a new beginning, for a new start. A lot of the people that came from Arkansas and Texas, Louisiana, the Mississippi area, came here for a new start. They came and Clearview, with its beginning in 1902, was a new town, and it was a new place to start all over. My dad said that they came here with the Pharoahs. That   s probably   what, another three miles from here. They had quite a vast area of land, and they came over to Arkansas looking for people to come and work their land, and a group of families came together, and came to this area.  Finchum Came by wagon and horse, I suppose.  Nero Came wagon, horses, walked, whichever way. (Laughs) I think they came by wagon and came to this area, and then they lived on some   did some sharecropping and also worked on farms around here on the Pharoah lands. Then some of them moved between here and Okemah and worked on the Doug Sharp lands and some other lands, and eventually moved up to Galilee, which is another black settlement that was in the area. Then from there into Clearview, just another mile section over from where I live right now, onto a place they called the Ballard place, where my dad was and his family.  Finchum Is it still in the family?  Nero Not that particular place where they lived because they didn   t own that place, but then about a mile and a half down the road, my mom and dad purchased the forty acres, and then that   s   we still have that.  Finchum What did they farm?  Nero They farmed cotton, and corn, and rotated the crops.  Finchum Did you have to help?  Nero I played around at helping. (Laughs) My dad hired people to help with the cotton during the cotton time. We had a little croker sack that my dad gave us when we were growing up, and we maybe filled it up during the day. We didn   t really have to work it like a lot of other people in the area that did. The cotton, and picking cotton, and stuff like that, we didn   t really have to because my dad owned the farm, but there were a lot of other families that were in Clearview that did a whole lot of work, pulling   it wasn   t picking, but pulling cotton, and those kinds of crops, and things like that. I remember going to school down here in Clearview, and we would close the school down for six weeks during the fall, and just the   almost half of the town or 7  more would just move away, and go out West, and pull cotton for that time just to make money for the rest of the year.  Finchum That   s free time for you then.  Nero It was. Well, that   s when my dad did his, but it was almost like free time for me because I didn   t really have to do a whole lot of work then.  Finchum With three daughters   Nero Yes. (Laughter)  Finchum He was hoping for boys at some point, I guess?  Nero Yeah, well you see he had a lot of boys that came around that was his nephews, and then we had a lot of neighbors and everything. There was always someone around the house, and we   they would always come around and everything like that, so it wasn   t like   . Our house was sort of like in the middle of transit between   walking to Clearview, to the town, and there was always people that were coming. We had nieces and things, and I think a lot of them just showed up at our house. For some reason or another, there was always someone around.  Finchum Liked your mother   s cooking?  Nero I had   they did like my mother   s cooking, and so it was almost like I had big brothers and sisters, that weren   t related to me or anything like that, so I have a lot of people now that I can call my brothers and sisters. That   s just the way it was. I think we were three of the most spoiled kids around. (Laughs)  Finchum What were your sisters    names?  Nero My sister that   s next to me, her name was Marilyn Bernice, yeah, and then I had another sister that   s name was Lavada Marie. I had an uncle that was out in California that thought my parents was so old that he always had a plan in his mind that my parents weren   t going to live long enough to see us to be grown. He always had a plan that we were going   that he was going to take us when they passed away and raise us, but luckily, they lived to see us all grown, way grown, passed being grown. They even saw some grandchildren.  Finchum Describe the house you grew up in.  Nero The house where I grew up in was   my mom said it was an oilfield house, so it was almost like a little shotgun-type house, and then I think they put 8  two little rooms on the side of it. It was like a little shed-type house, so it was two rooms long and then two on the side of the house. Then I can remember that it was set on rocks that held it up off the ground, and you could crawl under it. So my earliest memories of us, my dad had a hound dog, and he called it Old Blue, and he would crawl under the house, and I could go under the house where he was, the dog was. It didn   t have any siding or anything like that to keep the air   or the wind out, so you could see all the way underneath the house. Eventually we got something so it didn   t do that, but that   s the way the house was.  It had a front porch on it, and it had a back porch on it, and on the back porch   my mom had a wringer washer on the back porch, and then we   d get   she would wash clothes and then hang them out on the clothesline. Sometimes in the wintertime, those clothes would freeze before you could get them in because it was so cold, so that   s how we did. We didn   t have any indoor plumbing or anything like that. We had   I can remember the first time we got electricity in the house and the first time we ever had a TV. Well, all the whole time that I was growing up, I never had a phone, and no indoor bath or anything like that, and I went to college   it was the first time I had indoor plumbing or a phone, but we did have electricity. (Laughs) It was nothing that I ever missed because I   d never had it.  Finchum Well, how was it heated?  Nero Oh, we heated it with wood  At first we had wood, and then we had propane. We had a woodstove that was in the middle in the   I guess you call it a kitchen, and we had a front room, and we heated with the woodstove. My dad would parch corn on the stove and we   d have corn, parched corn or we   d have peanuts. My uncle grew a lot of peanuts, and we would parch those peanuts on the stove, and that was a lot of fun and a lot of good eating. My mom would can a lot, and we had a food shelf, and I guess kids would probably wouldn   t even know what a food shelf was. (Laughs)  Finchum I   m not sure, either.  Nero She had a   we called it a food shelf. It was just a shelf on the side of a wall, and it was just shelves, and it was stacked from the floor all the way up to the ceiling. We would can all summer long, and she   d just fill that whole side of the wall with canned goods, and it may be peaches, greens, beans, and even one year   my dad went fishing all the time and she even canned fish  (Laughter) So it was just food that she would put up for the whole winter, and   . The school that we went to   even the bus driver would fill up the bus with whoever wanted to and would go fishing. We would drive way up to Nuyaka  Oklahoma , or someplace like that, and fish all day long and just fill up the croker sacks full of fish, and then bring them back home.  9  We canned fish, and it was carp, buffalo (laughter), those kinds of fish, and we   d can fish for the wintertime and that was those kinds of things. So that was on the food shelf, and we would can those little peaches that would be on the   they were the ones that didn   t come off the seed. They never   the little, bitty ones, you just peel them and then just can the whole thing, and in the wintertime, and I thought those were so good. We   d just get those open   open those jars of the peaches and then suck the peach off the seed and then just suck on the seed for a long time. You just don   t get those kinds of things anymore.  Finchum Did you have sand plums, too?  Nero Yes we   oh, yes  We walked and we walked for the sand plums, and this last summer, my   the sand plum patch is still back up there. Where we stay now, we would walk over here from where our place was. We just never   we lived   where we live now is just a mile over from where I grew up. I told my kids, I said,    You ever seen a sand plum?    I said,    I   m going to show where there   s a sand plum patch.    We   d walk a mile over to the sand plums, and get sand plums and make jelly. So we took them up to the sand plum patch, and let them pick plums, and I took pictures of them and all that. Then we brought it back and made some plum butter and all that, with the sand plums. We had the berries, and we put coal oil on your socks, and all that to keep the chiggers off of you, (laughs) those kinds of things. Yeah.  Finchum And that worked?  Nero Oh yeah.  Finchum Did it?  Nero Yeah, we didn   t have OFF  insect repellent  back in the day, so you had to do something to keep them off of you.  Finchum I   ve had a few chigger bites. (Laughter) My mother would make us take baths with Clorox  bleach  to kill the chiggers.  Nero I don   t know if we had Clorox. I don   t remember anything about a Clorox.  Finchum Watered down, of course, but   .  Nero No, it was kerosene.  Finchum Is that how you lit   no, you said you had electricity.  Nero Oh, well we had kerosene lamps before we got the electricity, so that   s what you   d use, with the coal oil and the kerosene lamps before you had 10  electricity, and those were the ones that was on the wall. You   d light the little lamp with the little   .  Finchum You had to do homework before it got dark then.  Nero (Laughs) Oh, well that   s true. You   d have the little flicker of a light, but then I was in grade school when we got the electricity, and then we got the propane. We had one stove, in the front room was where we had the stove, and that   s where you took your bath, in the front room. Close up all the doors, because that was the only room that was heated in the house.  Finchum Had a number two tub, or whatever they called those?  Nero Yes, the number two tubs we had. (Laughs) Yeah, we had those, and then we had a smokehouse in the summertime, and you   d go out in the smokehouse in the summer time. When it wasn   t filled with meat or something like that you could go out and take your bath in the summertime, out in the smokehouse.  Finchum Well, being the oldest, did you get in the water first?  Nero I got in the water first. That   s what I always tell everybody  (Laughter) I got in the water first. Being the oldest, I could get in the water first. That was the joy of being the oldest, you got to do a lot of things first. Even got to be the boss a lot of times. (Laughs)  Finchum Well, did you get to do that once a week, or was it every other day, or every day?  Nero Yeah, it was a once a week. Well, you know, you got to get to do the little tub   the little pan baths in between the times, and doing those kinds of things.  Finchum Well, were there ponds where you could go swimming in the summer?  Nero I didn   t never   I never learned to swim. My dad could swim, but then we were up and down the creeks, we were up and down the rivers following my dad. He would make the footprints in the side of the banks and say   the foot holes and say,    You just step in my foot holes that I made,    and made sure we never fell in, or anything like that, and I never learned how to swim. The boys that came up to the house would   and with my older cousins and everything, they would go to the ponds and swim, but we never followed them or anything like that. We would go to the creeks, and my dad would always get us a big, long pole, and said,    When you cross the creek, just put this pole in front of you, and if the water   s too deep,    or something like, 11     you don   t cross in that place like that. Just make sure that the water is not too deep.     We never had any problem being out in the creeks and playing in creeks. I had other cousins, and girl cousins, and all that, and my uncle had a syrup mill. He grew cane, and he made syrup, and sold syrup and everything, and you know, you always have to be around the creek when you   re doing syrup. We played in the creek down by where he was and splashed in the water, and I don   t know   we never learned how to swim, none of us, but we always went mud-crawling and everything else, but we didn   t   and we were around those spring creeks and everything like that, but no swimming. I didn   t learn to swim until I went to college, and they told us we had to take P.E., and I thought,    Well, I   ll just take P.E. in college and try to swim.    I made a C in the class, because I couldn   t float. (Laughter)  Finchum That is about all I can do.  Nero I couldn   t float. I said   they said   you had to jump in the water, and there   s ten feet of water, and come back up and lay on your back and float for a while, and I jumped in and the lady had to   the teacher had to pull me out with the hook. (Laughter) I was next to the last one to finally finish all the criteria for swimming and I thought    Well, if I made a C, I survived.    (Laughs)  Finchum What did your dad say about that C?  Nero He said   he just laughed at me. He said,    Well, I guess you survived.    I said,    Well I could make it out.    I said,    I couldn   t save anybody, but I could probably save myself.    (Laughter)  Finchum Well, you followed his instructions, at least when you were in the water growing up.  Nero Yeah, I don   t get in the water too often unless I have a life jacket on.  Finchum Well, if you were around water that much, were there snakes?  Nero I   m not afraid of them so the snakes didn   t ever bother me, because I never was afraid of a snake or anything like that, so those things didn   t ever bother me at all.  Finchum Well, crawling under the house you wouldn   t have been afraid of anything.  Nero I mean, that was the thing about it. I never was afraid to go out into the woods or follow the dogs. My mom said once she looked up and I was way out across the road, following the dogs out through the woods. That just 12  never bothered me, about being afraid of anything like that. Spiders or snakes or anything didn   t bother me.  Finchum Well, did you have to share a room with the sisters?  Nero I did, we had one bed. The house only had like two, little bedrooms, and while I was little, all three of us slept in the bed. Since I was the oldest and could out power my other two sisters   remember I told you we just had one room that was heated in the wintertime, so I always slept in the middle so as I could be warm, (laughter) and that was mean of me. I think about that a lot of times. I said,    I made them sleep on the outside.     Our bedroom in the wintertime would be so cold. It was on the north side of the house and my dad would say, well, he would say,    Get a towel, and go and hold it up next to the fire, and get the towel real hot, and then go jump in the bed, and wrap it around your feet so your feet would stay warm.    I remember the covers being so heavy that you couldn   t hardly turn over, because you were just trying to stay warm, you   d have so many covers on the bed.  Eventually, you know, we kind of got some of those plastic kits that you could put on the windows to keep the air from coming into your house. We were talking about that just the other day. About how you can put those plastic kits around the windows to keep the air from coming into your house, so it wasn   t very insulated or anything like that. It was some cold nights.  Finchum Did your mother quilt?  Nero She quilted, and we did. We would have people come, neighbors or something. We   d set up a big quilt in the front room, and quilt a quilt in a week or something like that. And before I left home, I quilted my first quilt, and I still have it.  Finchum What pattern? Do you remember?  Nero It was just a block quilt.  Finchum Like a nine-patch or something?  Nero Yes.  Finchum I   m assuming if you were layered up, you probably had quilts     Nero Yes   Finchum    keeping you warm. 13  Nero Oh, we were making quilts out of   some of them I look back at and I say,    There   s my old dress, or there   s       something like that that they put into it. So whatever they could tear up and put into a quilt, that   s what it was. I can see some of my stitches compared to my mom   s stiches, or somebody else   s stitches, or something like that.  I learned to crochet. There was a neighbor that could crochet, and she taught me a little bit about crocheting. She made these beautiful dollies. I never made one, I just learned how to do a little chain stitch and something like that.  Then my mom worked for a lady that lived on up on 62 Highway. She had an old store, and my mom would go up and clean her house or something like that, and I was small, and she knitted. She was knitting a blanket, and so she said,    Come here. Let me teach you some stitches,    and so she had me stitch. I did one or two, and I said,    Oh, they look so ugly     She said,    They   re just beautiful. That   s pretty,    and she just let me do them. Then she just knitted right around them and left them in her pattern that she was doing. She didn   t take them out and redo them or anything. She just left them the way they were in her blanket that she was knitting.  Finchum That was sweet.  Nero I thought that was real nice of her to do that.  Finchum Well, did your mother make your clothes?  Nero She did.  Finchum Did she?  Nero She taught me to make clothes, so she made them and then she taught me to sew when I was too small to   she had a treadle machine, so I would stand up, and peddle that old machine and sew. I don   t remember   . She must made some of them, but I remember making my own clothes. I know I started sewing really early. I know she used to make the, you know   used to buy flour in those flour sacks, and we went to the store, and we   d pick out the flour sack pattern that you wanted, and she would make the clothes out of that.  I always liked being in 4-H Club and home economics and like that, so I just really started sewing my own stuff. The first really big outfit that I ever made, it was a green pea-colored suit that I made, and it had a three-quarter length suit top, and it was a dress, an A-line dress under it. I made it, and I got to thinking about that. I said,    My aunt gave me some material.    I 14  always had someone giving me fabric to make something out of. I think back to those days, I said,    That dress, and that suit that I made,    I said,    I think that might have been some curtain material, some drapery material I used to make that dress out of.    (Laughs) I said,    But I don   t know if it was or not, but I kind of think       That   s what it kind of reminded me of when I was making it, but I made it. It was really a tailored outfit that was real pretty, that I made. Since I could sew really, really good, my two aunts that I had, one on my dad   s side and one on my mom   s side, they would just bring me material, and I could just make things without a pattern     Finchum Without a pattern?  Nero    or anything. I wish I could do it now  (Laughs)  Finchum Visualize it and put it to work, huh?  Nero Put it together. Just sew it up. Uh-huh.  Finchum Well, you mentioned that you went to school here in Clearview.  Nero Yes.  Finchum How many were in your class, your particular class?  Nero My class? There was only seven of us in my class. You know, being from Clearview, which is an historically all-black town, and it was during the time of segregation so by the time I started school in 1956   I wanted to start the school   my birthday is in December and I wanted to go to school earlier, the year before. There was some other kids that were in December or earlier, and we all went to school, and they sent me and a couple others back home the year before, and told us we had to wait until the next year.  Well, then there were some other kids that they kept, that I was actually older than they were, and they were some of the teachers    kids that had gone. Looking back at it, I think that the class ahead of me, they were probably deciding on who was going to be in the class ahead, to try to divide them up. They said what class was, to make the classes even or something like that, so I got send home. I was devastated because I didn   t get to go school and had to wait. I was crying and everything else, but there were seven of us that started the school the next year.  Finchum How many of each? Boys and girls?  Nero There were three boys and four girls.  Finchum Well, you outnumbered. Okay  15  Nero Yes.  Finchum And close enough to walk from home?  Nero No, no. I had to ride a bus because I lived out off of 62 Highway, and the school district meandered out to my district. Where 62 Highway meets    where I had to be picked up, there was an Indian family that lived right on the corner, and they went to school at Pharoah, and we went to school at Clearview, so we all stood on the same corner. Two buses picked us up at the same corner, and that was because that   s just the way it was back in those days, you know. You had to go to your own school district.  It was kind of funny though because of how they drew those school districts, because they crossed each other. They had to cross each other, because there was another black family that lived across the street, across the highway, and those kids had to go to Clearview School, but then those Indian kids right there, they went to the school over in Pharoah. I know they had to hop over each other or something like that, however they did that, to get those kids to go to Pharoah School and not in the Clearview school district. And then the ones right up the road, too, they went to Pharoah School. So it   s strange how they can draw school districts and make them work to where you can make sure you get to go to the right school, back in the days.  I used to teach. When I was teaching school, I told them, I said,    That   s how it worked. We all stood on the same corner, but two school buses picked us up at the same corner.    We all stood on the same corner, but got on separate school buses. I said,    There was a whole line of mailboxes, and all the mailboxes were all on the same post, but then you had two mail carriers that put mail in.    Even our mailboxes were segregated. (Laughs) The mailman came there, and there was your mailboxes, and you got your mail from Clearview, and then the Pharoah people got their mail from Pharoah, but they were all lined up on the same post. I said,    That was even strange to me, too, how you got your mail the same way, too.    So your mail was segregated the same way.  Finchum Well, when the students were sitting there waiting for the bus, could you communicate without getting in trouble?  Nero Oh, we played together. Oh yeah  Oh no, we were all friends, and we played together, and we visited each other, and everything else. Everybody was as friendly as they could be. They were up in our house, we were down in their house. The girl on the corner taught me how to ride a bike. She had a bike and I didn   t have one, so she came up and taught me how to ride a bicycle, and wrote me out a bicycle license, and made me an official bicycle driver. (Laughter) She sure did. She later became a school teacher up in Bearden 16   Oklahoma , so it was like a   they traded meat. My dad had hogs, and he had cattle, so they would trade beef or pork, and just shared everything. It was just that your school was segregated, your mail was all segregated, but as far as living and sharing everything else, everybody else was the same way.  We just had one neighbor up the road, and he was really strange. He didn   t want to have too much to do with us. We called him the sawmill man, and he had a sawmill, and he was a little bit strange. He didn   t want anybody messing with him or anything like that, you know, until he thought that   when Cuba had gone communist, and he thought there was going to be an atomic bomb or something set off, he all of a sudden got friendly  We had a cellar and he didn   t. He thought that he was going to get to come down and use our cement cellar, just in case we got bombed. (Laughs) Him and my dad had some words over that. (Laughs) Other than that, everybody else was just as friendly as   and you know, it was just the times. That   s just the way it was, back in the day.  Finchum Well, was the school one through twelve?  Nero It was one through twelve. It was a high school, first grade through twelfth grade.  Finchum So total number of kids would probably be less than a hundred?  Nero It was. It got down to   when there got to be less than a hundred, then, you know, they said that they had to integrate, and then they closed the high school in 1964, and then left the first through eighth grade. Then they decided,    Well, we   re going to integrate the kids,    you know.    You got to go somewhere.    Clearview was closer to Okemah, and Okemah   although I guess they weren   t ready for it, and then   so Weleetka  Oklahoma .  Weleetka had a black school, at one time, that burned down. It was strange about them. They had a one through eighth grade, and that one through eighth grade was   it was on the same campus, but they were still segregated. They had a black teacher, two of them, that taught one through eighth grade, but the high school was integrated, but they were still on the same campus. They had two little rooms on the back of a library, (laughs) on the same campus and everything. They were still segregated, so then they just integrated the whole school, and then they took Clearview   s school.  Finchum So that   s where you graduated from high school?  Nero Uh-huh. I went to high school down there.  Finchum What year did you graduate? 17  Nero Sixty-eight.  Finchum Sixty-eight so   .  Nero Uh-huh, and then by    69, they closed the entire Clearview School down, and just integrated the whole thing and closed the whole school down.  Finchum So you would have gone there one through   .  Nero No, I just went to the high school there.  Finchum No, but here in Clearview, you went grades one through     Nero One through eight.  Finchum    one through eight. So you had a different teacher each year or      Nero I had, no. When I was going to school there, we had   I had a   one teacher taught two grades. I had the first and second grade, one teacher, and then I had a different teacher in the third grade, a different teacher in the fourth grade, different teacher in the fifth grade, different teacher in sixth grade. Then they moved them around. My sister that was next to me, she had the same teacher. They moved her around, and she ended up with the same teacher one through sixth grade. She never changed teachers. (Laughter)  Finchum That can be good and bad, I guess.  Nero She said it was bad, (laughter) but I only had that one teacher once, first and second grade, but she had that one teacher one through sixth grade, because she kept moving up. Then by the time she moved up, that same teacher had   by the time they moved her up to the seventh grade, I got her, but she was the home economics teacher, so I got her as a   which was what she was. She was actually a home economics teacher, and she was really good as a home economics teacher, which is what she should   ve been teaching.  I think the teacher who was the home economics teacher had moved away, or no   had come there, and put this Ms. Walker into the first and the second grade. Put her down in elementary, as an elementary teacher, and she really wasn   t an elementary school teacher. We had a lot of teachers that came to Clearview, and they were, I guess you call them, transit teachers, or they didn   t live in the community. They came down to stay for a week. They boarded. They would stay and then they would go home on the weekends, a lot of them would.  Finchum From Tulsa? 18  Nero From Tulsa.  Finchum Bigger towns?  Nero Oklahoma City, and they would move on to another bigger school or something like that, so they didn   t actually live in the community. We had, during the time I was there, maybe four of the teachers, maybe, stayed in the town. The rest of them just came and went so   .  Finchum Makes it a little different for you.  Nero It made them a little different. Then when they integrated, none of the teachers followed us. So that was the bad thing about integration, is that they move you but they don   t move your teachers with you.  Finchum Well, did that go smoothly or roughly for the students?  Nero It was   because I was in the middle of it, I was. When they closed, I was the one that had to go, so it was a different situation. It was scary for us, and I   m sure it was scary for the   it was a different situation for those other teachers. Some of the teachers down at Weleetka had already experienced teaching black kids, because they had already integrated the high school and they had had some of them. Some of those kids in Weleetka had a choice. Before they had integrated the high school in Weleetka, the kids in Weleetka came to Clearview. That   s where they had to come, to Clearview.  When they first started integration, they gave them a choice to go to Weleetka or come to Clearview, and some of them still came over to Clearview, and a few of them went to Weleetka. After, I think, Weleetka found out that they could get that state money, they didn   t want to give it up, that they told them to come on over to Weleetka, and they got that money. They had   some of them had that experience, and I think that after such a big number of black kids coming over to Weleetka, it was probably frightening for them. But we didn   t have any problems, it was just a new experience, some of them welcomed us.  Finchum Some didn   t?  Nero Some didn   t, so   but it wasn   t any really big problems. It was   the challenge was for us. We were a little deficient in some areas, you know. We didn   t have a lot of the supplies and a lot of the     Finchum Science and chemistry probably, and biology, whatever   .  19  Nero    yeah, some of the classes that those kids had had. We were a little bit behind, probably, in math, and literature, and things like that.  Finchum Caught up quick though, I   d say.  Nero We did, yeah. (Laughs)  Finchum Did you have 4-H there, then?  Nero I don   t remember if they had any 4-H. I went straight into home ec, I did. No more 4-H. I don   t    remember any 4-H down there. If they had it, I don   t know anything a   I don   t remember. I went right into home ec because I knew that   s where I could survive.  Finchum You could sew already.  Nero I knew, I just   what the teacher said,    You already know what to do. You already know how to do this. You can sew, and you can cook, and you can teach us something,    because that   s what we did. That was our strong point in Clearview, was 4-H Club. We knew how to do that because that was one thing that they wanted. That was the big thing that they wanted blacks to learn how to do was, you know, you can sew and you can cook. That was it. That was what they wanted you to do, and it was learning how to do those kinds of skills.  Finchum But your parents wanted more than...  Nero Yeah, they did.  Finchum    they expected you to go to college?  Nero Yeah, they did. They wanted us to. They gave up everything they could to get us to go to college. They wanted to see that happen.  Finchum Well, what was your favorite subject in high school?  Nero Just like I said, home economics.  Finchum Home ec.  Nero When I went to college, that   s what I majored in was home economics.  Finchum And where did you go to for that?  Nero I went to that East Central State.  20  Finchum East Central, in Ada  Oklahoma ?  Nero In Ada.  Finchum And majored in home economics.  Nero In home economics, yeah. We had   in the    60s, you know, most of the time if you got a scholarship, you got a scholarship from Langston. So I   ve always been asked,    Why didn   t you go to Langston?    and I say,    Well, you know, that was in the    60s. That was the year of the Civil Rights Movement and everything like that.    I said,    I didn   t have anything against going to Langston, but then that was the movement, and that was where, you know, you going to go where somebody didn   t want you to go.     We went to East Central, and that was   it just happened to be that there was a lot of other people with that kind of a thinking:    We   re going to go into these colleges and universities where you   re not expected to be.    I told my counselor in school in Weleetka,    I   m not going to take a scholarship to go to Langston. I want to go someplace else,    and several of the rest of us. He said,    Well, pick out three places you want to go, and I   ll take you, and we   ll go look at them,    and I chose East Central.  Finchum What were the other two?  Nero Wilburton and down at Murray State.  Finchum Not OSU?  Nero No, I thought that was probably too big for me. I didn   t know if I could survive. It was kind of scary for OSU, but then there were some other   was one right behind me that went to OSU, and then I think there were some other ones that went to OU.  Finchum Between Ada and Stillwater, it would be about the same distance or maybe it   s further to Ada?  Nero It   s probably   it   s a little bit farther, yeah, but then, I just wasn   t   in my mind   . I know some other ones that had gone to OSU and everything, but that was a little   it was just a little bit scarier for me, then, to do that.  Finchum Well, did you have any trouble getting in Ada, in East Central?  Nero No, and it could be because of my counselor. Could have said that, and then plus it was money, getting the money to go there. It was cheaper.  Finchum Did you have to work or was there    21  Nero I did  I had to go to work. I had to get a grant and everything else to go, and I had to work to go there. I worked in the Student Union. Went down and begged them to give me the job to work, so I worked in the Student Union down there, and stayed in the dorm, and got that little government grant to go to school on, so   .  Finchum Stayed four years, and graduated in, would have graduated in seventy     Nero Sixty-eight.  Finchum Okay. Well then, what did you do after that?  Nero Well, I met my husband down there, and we got married while we were down there, and then we left there. There was a so called little race riot in Sapulpa  Oklahoma  in    72 or    71, something like that, that they supposedly said that they had up at the school some problems. There was a gentleman that had just come to work down there at East Central named Mr. Lee, and Mr. Lee said that,    They have a lot of job openings in Sapulpa. You all can go up there and get you a job.    Just at the right time, and they said,    There   s a lot of teachers that left.    So we came to Sapulpa, and there got a job in Sapulpa, and then   .  You know, it was the Vietnam era, and my husband was trying to stay out of Vietnam. They called him up to go to   and he got in the Reserves and then they called him and said,    You got to go.    So he asked the people in Sapulpa if they would hold his job. They sent him off to Fort Dix, New Jersey, for one semester and then let him   then didn   t send him over to Vietnam. They let him stay in the Reserves and sent him back. They held his job open for him up in Sapulpa, so that   s where we went, to Sapulpa. Got a job up there, and they hired a lot of blacks   black teachers in Sapulpa, probably about ten or so.  Finchum It   s better than being the only one, I guess, isn   t it?  Nero Yeah.  Finchum To have some comrades? (Laughter)  Nero Yeah, they hired a lot of them.  Finchum Well, where was your husband from?  Nero He was from another black school, Dunjee. Dunjee is in Spencer  Oklahoma .  22  Finchum Okay. So he   s from Oklahoma City?  Nero He   s from the Oklahoma City area.  Finchum He had chosen to go   .  Nero He chose to go   he had a scholarship to play baseball at Langston, and he turned it down to go to  East Central . It was just quite interesting about how all   it just happened that there were a lot of blacks that just came to East Central during the   like 1966,    67,    68 because at East Central, there were only a very few. They were playing football. I think in sixty   maybe    64,    65,    66 there were only two that were down maybe, two or three   Tex Rollins and Jimmie Scales were playing football, and they were the first  black  athletes to ever play at East Central. Then there was one, Sherman Moore, I think he came maybe two years after that, somewhere right around    67 or something like that, played basketball. So it was just a handful of blacks down at East Central at all. Then all of a sudden, there   s just this drove of blacks that just showed up down at East Central, and we formed a   got together, and come from Wilburton and out of Tishomingo, they started coming in.  We got together and formed this club called the Utilidelphian Club. We got a sponsor. Mr.  Wagner , the president of the college, welcomed the club and got us the sponsor, Dr. Pascal. (Laughs) He had to say that,    I don   t care what anybody else is saying. They need a sponsor,    because you had to have a sponsor to have a club. He sponsored our Utilidelphian Club, and we just started putting the black kids into every organization, applying for everything on campus, student of the month. This is happening over a couple of years, and my sister came the next year, and then the next year we got two girls on the cheerleading squad. We were running for queen. I ran for queen, you know. You   re not going to get it, but then you   re going to be running for things. We were in the Homecoming parades, we did plays, we did everything. We had a few of them   couple of them got to be students of the month, and everything else like that, so we just changed everything on campus just by doing stuff like that. We were trying to get in the sororities, fraternities, and everything   just changed the whole atmosphere, what it was like at East Central.  We had a lot of   some of the professors didn   t want it to happen, but it happened, but   . We had to figure out how to study, we had to get together. We were in the library every night, strategizing and everything like that on how to make it, because we even had to do work with   even having to fight the police in the city, (laughs) because they were just on our   every time you   d turn around, we got   we laughed about it. We had a fund in my dorm. I didn   t spend money, I always was trying to make money. I ironed for the guys and make a little money, or cut their hair, something like this, 23  and I always had my extra little money somewhere. And they always laughed about me, about having money to fund   money to go down and get somebody out of jail, (laughs) because they were always looking for somebody to put them in jail for some reason or other, so I   d have bail money. (Laughs)  Finchum Did you actually have to use it?  Nero One time, I did. One time, I did. I did. I had to go down there and bail him, pay and get a little bail money, just because   it was just one guy they had picked up because he had his tag. He had it in the back of his car in the window. He just didn   t have time to put it on his car, and they took him to jail, and said,    Well, you didn   t have it on your car.    So they kept him in the lockup down there until they drove back and got my money, took it down there and paid his little fine, and then let him   they had to put the tag on the car, and let him go. It was my husband   s cousin, we weren   t married then, and put the tag on the car, drive back to the dorm, get the money, and then go take it back up there and get him out. Over a tag.  Finchum You had a strong will to keep plowing ahead.  Nero Well, yeah. You know, that was just the way   we knew that   s how it was, and you know, you just do what you have to do to   .  Finchum So you   ve formed some good friendships, too.  Nero You do, good friendships like that, and you deal with it, and you try to make things right.  Finchum Were your parents supportive of that decision, to go the hard path instead of the easy path?  Nero Yeah.  Finchum Were they?  Nero Yeah. They were, they knew. They had lived it, they knew what to do. Daddy always says,    Watch out for certain things.    That   s what he always said.  Finchum Didn   t worry about your safety too much?  Nero Well, I   m sure he was, he did, but they didn   t      Finchum Let that be enough to keep you here.  24  Nero Uh-umm. They knew you had to be out in the world someday. It   s kind of like I am with my own, you know? You raise your kids up to get out on their own and make their own decisions. You worry about them, but you know someday they going to have to live without you.  Finchum Well did you spend your entire career at Sapulpa?  Nero No, I didn   t. We taught there until 2000, and we left. My husband got a job at Warner, and you know, I was pretty secure at Sapulpa. I loved it there, I liked the school system that I was working in, and I was pretty comfortable with my job and all that, and had made my way and loved it there. He   s the adventurous one, and I   m kind of one of those people that when you got it made, you just stay there. You don   t move on, (laughs) to do anything like that, and he had several jobs. He had been a principal, and   well, he was a coach and he was a teacher, and he   d become a principal. He left education and went to work for an airplane company for a while, and stayed there two years, and he came back.  He was the principal in the high school, and then he left there, and he went to work for Tulsa Community Colleges as a provost for fifteen years. Then he decided, well, he   s going to go and do something else, so he became president at Connors State College. I said,    Well, shoot. That   s going to make me have to move.    (Laughs) You know,    You   ve been doing all your things all your life. I get to stay where I wanted to stay. I don   t have to move and do all these things. I can still stay where I am, and my kids are all grown up now and out, and I   m satisfied being right here. Now we have to sell my house, and I have to move and all this.     I was involved in the Oklahoma Education Association and all that. I think while we were gone that year in Florida or someplace like that he says,    Well, we   re moving,    and I guess   well, he and my daughter, they got together, and they sold the house. They had a garage sale, sold the house during the garage sale and all this. (Laughter) I come back, and I said,    I guess I   m really going to have to move now.       Yeah, you   re going to have to move.    I told my principal, I said,    I guess I   m moving.    We go down and get our place down here in Warner, and I said,    I never have been to Warner in my life. You know, I don   t know what it   s going to be like or anything like that,    and I says,    Well, I guess I need to go find a job down here in Warner.    Do you know where Warner is?  Finchum No.  Nero You don   t? It   s in Muskogee County.  Finchum Okay.  25  Nero It   s south of Muskogee right on Interstate 40, and I thought,    Oh, wow  I guess I have three more years before I can retire, and I have to find another job somewhere. I don   t know if I can find another job anywhere else.    I never resigned from my teaching job in Sapulpa, and I left everything in my room and all this, and I thought   . Well, my principal called back and said,    You   re going to have to come get your stuff out of your room. You   re going to really have to leave. You   re going to have to resign.    I guess I was in denial. (Laughs) I wasn   t going to do it, and he said,    You   re going to have to come get this.    I still didn   t go get my stuff, so finally the janitor, who was really good friends with me, she packed up all my stuff and said,    You got to come get your stuff. Somebody else is in your room.     I said,    Aw man  I guess I have to come up and resign and get all my stuff,    so I went on up there, and I got my stuff and went on back down to Warner. Says,    I guess I need to get me a job,    and I tried to find a job down there, and I couldn   t find a job anywhere down in there. Finally, my husband said    You   re going to have to go get you a job someplace,    and he finally called around, and I applied a few places. They just wasn   t looking for me, is what it was. They just   if you know anything about that area down there, and I tried over in Muskogee.  Finally, he called down to this little place called Porum  Oklahoma , and the principal down there (and I never even put in an application or anything like that), and he called me down for an interview, and I went in. The little lady down there says,    Just sit down, right over there, and the principal will be out in a minute,    and I sit down in the seat. He finally called me in, and he says,    Well, I think we need you down here. You will bring a new perspective to the area,    and I says,    I don   t know if I want to be the new perspective in Porum.    (Laughs) He called me back three times before I finally said yes, that I   d go and work in Porum, but it was a good experience to work in Porum. It was a little town. It was about nine hundred people. Yeah, and I told the kids, I said,    Nine hundred people.    I said,    In the school where I came from, there was nine hundred people in the two classes that I taught, so this is a little bit different for me to be teaching down in Porum.     The first class   when I walked in, he told me I had the ninth grade. I said,    Okay.    He said,    Well you   ll be taking the ninth grade class as the sponsor.    I said,    Okay.    Well, I   d never sponsored a class. I said,    I guess I can sponsor the ninth grade class. All right, I   ll take the ninth grade class.    I taught ninth grade through twelfth grade, and I was just accustomed to having just the ninth grade class. That   s what I thought I   d have. He said,    No, you   re going to have the ninth grade through the twelfth grade classes,    and I taught social studies. I told you, I was a home economics teacher, but the whole time, I never got to teach home economics. I was a social studies teacher, I taught Oklahoma History most of my career, 26  because I had a minor in sociology/psychology, which later developed and I went ahead and got a degree in social studies. I taught Oklahoma History, and I ended up at OSU and got a MA in History, so that   s how I ended up at OSU.  Finchum We should probably talk about that then. When was that? When did you go to OSU?  Nero I went   I started in 1982.  Finchum Eighty-two. Finished it in two years or   .  Nero No, I didn   t. It took me a long time before I finally finished it. I didn   t actually start the degree in history then. I started on a teacher corps project. They were giving degrees in, I can   t remember what the actual degree was. It was a teacher corps program. You could come out with a communications, or it was just some sort of general degree that you just kind of got a master   s degree in, and I cannot remember what it was. It was some kind of teacher corps project or something they gave a degree in, but I never did finish up that. They were just some hours, and so I never did finish up that part of it.  So what I did was, since I was teaching social studies   and I had gone over to TCC  Tulsa Community College  and gotten some geography classes and all that, because I couldn   t get a home economics job, which I was waiting on. While we were in Sapulpa, the home economics teachers never retired, so I thought,    This is no end to this. They   re not going to leave.    I needed to do something else. I got the social study   I went back and got a social studies certification so I could actually have a standard certificate in social studies. I went on a   later on than the    80s,    82 through    86. I went on a geography study tour two years in a row at OSU, and they were both in the summer time. That got me interested in geography and history, because it was a combined study tour with the history classes and the geography classes, so then I got interested in that. I thought,    I   ll just go back, and just get me a master   s degree in history,    so that   s what I did. I did that and finished it in    92.  Finchum Taking a couple of classes a semester?  Nero Yes.  Finchum So you couldn   t do it full-time because you were working?  Nero No. Oh, yeah.  Finchum So most of your classes would have been in   where are the history classes? Classroom Building, maybe. 27  Nero It was in the Classroom Building. Uh-huh.  Finchum You   d have to commute back and forth?  Nero Night time, by myself.  Finchum Before the BOB, before the big orange bus?  Nero Oh, before that  Yes, there was no orange bus. Not at all. No, no bus to commute. I had to commute one time with a couple of teachers that started out   in fact, I don   t even know if he ever finished over there or not.  Finchum Well, if you   re going at night, did you spend much time, outside of class time, on campus?  Nero No, not at   . Most of it was just in that history department, over there with the   in that library. That was before the computers and everything else, when you actually had to go, and look at the documents, and everything like that. In fact, I had a class with Dr. Rohrs, his methods class, and oh, he was tough  He was, he was   we had to do a research paper, and he said that he would go over, and actually look at your resources, and check to see if you actually looked at that resource.  He thought maybe I was about to plagiarize on something, or I didn   t actually look at the source is what it was. He went over there and said,    Oh well, I guess you did look at the source because I saw where you checked it off in red marks,    and I said,    Oh, wow  I   m so glad I checked that resource off in those red marks, so he can actually say I did look at it     (Laughs) I said,    Oh, he scared me to death,    I thought,    Oh, I could have just failed this class if I hadn   t put some marks on those places on there where he actually looked at it to see that I did it.    I said,    I didn   t know that they really went over and checked your resources like that in the library.    He was a   I   ll always remember Dr. Rohrs. He was a good, good methods teacher, and I remember him.  And Dr. Stout was one that also was a good teacher that I had written a paper, and I was using passive voice in there. He said,    Don   t ever use that again,    and he took that paper, and he marked all over it, and he just threw it across the table at me like that and said,    I don   t ever want to see that in your paper again.    I said    You won   t ever see it in my papers again.    (Laughter) There was my experiences with the history department.  Finchum I guess you had to do some research then in Special Collections.  Nero Uh-huh  Uh-huh. 28  Finchum The archival part?  Nero Yes, I did.  Finchum I didn   t come until the late    90s. Was the card catalog still there on the second floor?  Nero The card catalog was there. Yes, the card catalog was there.  Finchum I would have loved to have seen it all set up right there, but it was gone by the time I got there.  Nero Oh really   oh, yes  The card catalog was there, and all those books, and everything else. You had to go and ask Special Collections, and go in there, and ask to go in and do all that. I said,    I don   t even know how to act if I had to go over there again,    because that   s what I remember  I don   t know anything else other than that.  Finchum Did you have to go over on weekends, too, to do the homework?  Nero The weekends, yes.  Finchum Did history require a foreign language? Did you have to have a foreign language?  Nero No, they were asking me to do one that you don   t have to   as long as you were able to read it, you didn   t have to speak it. (Laughs)  Finchum Oh, okay.  Nero They said,    Why don   t you get your doctorate degree?    (Laughs) I said,    No, no, no, no     I said,    Now I   m killing myself.    I should have gone ahead and done it while they were really interested in me getting it, and that they would have really helped me a lot on doing that. Then I could   ve gone on and done that, but I was so tired of having to drive over and do all that. Now, I   m kind of killing myself that I didn   t go ahead and get that doctorate degree, because I probably would   ve had a lot of help getting it done.  Finchum Never too late   Nero Oh, yeah, it is  Now all the people that I knew once, knew over there   I think Dr. Smith is probably about the only one. Well, Dr. Rohrs is still there.  Finchum He still comes in the library from time to time.  29  Nero Does he? He   s probably checking on those students just like he was checking on me. (Laughs) You tell him I said hello the next time you see him. (Laughs)  Finchum That   s a switch though, from home ec to history. You   d have to take some prerequisites and catch up I would think.  Nero Yeah, uh-huh. Well, I had that minor in psychology/sociology, which was a social studies. Now   things are so different now. You have to be specialized in every subject to teach it now. You have to pass every subject area to teach it, so I wouldn   t make it now so   .  Finchum Well, did you go through the graduation ceremony at OSU?  Nero I did, I did.  Finchum You got hooded?  Nero Yeah, I did. It was Dr. Bryans that hooded me. He   s still there too.  Finchum I don   t recognize that name.  Nero Bryans?  Finchum Oh, yes, Bryans. Yes, he is. Bill, he is still there.  Nero He did. I wanted Dr. Rohrs to do it, but he wasn   t available I don   t think, so it was Dr. Bryans.  Finchum Was it in the arena or in the football stadium?  Nero It was in the arena.  Finchum Inside.  Nero Uh-huh. He did. The thing about it was that my son and my husband, we all graduated the same day. I had my master   s degree, my husband got his doctorate   s degree, and my son got his bachelor   s degree. We all   we made the front page of the Tulsa World.  Finchum All from OSU?  Nero All from OSU  We were all there for the same weekend and OSU grads  Doctorate, master   s, and bachelor   s.  Finchum I   d say that doesn   t happen very often  30  Nero No, so we got our picture made, and it was on the Tulsa World front page. The Tulsa World   Finchum Where had your husband got his master   s?  Nero At OSU.  Finchum OSU. In higher ed or   .  Nero In higher ed, yeah. He has his own story about that too, so    (Laughs)  Finchum Okay, I may have to come back.  Nero Yeah, he   s got his own story about that master   s degree.  Finchum And your   how many children do you have?  Nero We have two. A daughter, Tanya, and a son is   we call him D. J. His name is Donnie Lee Nero, Jr.  Finchum Did the daughter go to OSU too?  Nero No, she didn   t.  Finchum Not yet, anyway.  Nero No. She went to NSU  Northeastern State University . She went to school on a basketball scholarship, so she got her way paid through all the way on a basketball scholarship, and then she got a grad assistantship and got her master   s degree. All free   Finchum Good for her, huh?  Nero So she   s got her master   s degree, and she went all six years before she even got out. Now, she   s a teacher and a basketball coach at Glenpool, so she probably won   t go back. (Laughs) She might later on.  Finchum It just depends on if she gets a pay raise to. Do more hours and you get a pay raise, in teaching?  Nero No. (Laughs) Right now, she   s busy with coaching and teaching.  Finchum Coaching basketball?  Nero Basketball, track. 31  Finchum Well, did you play basketball?.  Nero I did. I actually tried to   well, that was in the day when they didn   t give scholarships to girls in basketball. If you wanted to play, you just went out and played. I went out, and looked at those girls on that basketball court, and thought,    I don   t think I want to get beat up by these girls.    (Laughs) I was too skinny. I was tall but I was little. Those girls were tall and they were big. I didn   t want to   I said,    Nah, that   s all right. I   ll just not do this.    My girlfriend and I both went. We thought we were good at playing basketball, until we went down there and thought,    No, we don   t want to do this.    (Laughs)  Finchum But you encouraged your daughter to.  Nero I did, yeah. Well, they were giving scholarships then. I guess if I   d have got a scholarship, and it would have paid me to do that, then that   s probably something I would have done, but   .  Finchum Well, what degree did your son get from OSU?  Nero He was in communications.  Finchum So he walked across the stage first   well, I guess they had different ceremonies.  Nero Yeah.  Finchum His would have been   undergrad would   ve been different from the others. That   s pretty neat, all three of you.  Nero Yes.  Finchum The daughter   s taking the pictures then. (Laughs)  Nero Yeah.  Finchum It was always assumed they would go to college, but they could pick where?  Nero They could pick wherever they wanted to go. He always wanted to go to   we made him go to TCC first, stay home, and he could drive and go, because he could go for tuition free at TCC.  Finchum Get his core done.  32  Nero Yeah, and I said    You   re going to go first, and you go over there where you don   t have to pay tuition, and see if you...,    and he   s a little different, and I said,    See if you can make it,    and all this kind of stuff.    You can go on over there, and stay those two years, and then if you want to go to OSU   ,    that   s where he always wanted to go. He and his best friend, and they wanted to room together and all that.  I said,    Well, you go over there, and you work and pay for your tuition, and everything else. We can help you with your room and board or whatever, and do that.    So that   s what he and his little friend, he did. Let   s see, what did his friend   . Yeah, he stayed with him until   both of them stayed roommates until they both graduated and everything, but his friend, he stayed in Sapulpa. I think he still stays in Sapulpa, or Tulsa, somewhere along in that, and my son, he   s out in California.  Finchum That   s too far from home   Nero Too far from home  He stayed around Tulsa for a long time, then finally decided to move out to California, but his friend   I think he got married, early, and stayed in Sapulpa, where his hometown was.  Finchum Where did you son live on campus? Did he stay in a dorm?  Nero No, he stayed in   they got them a little, old apartment.  Finchum Off-campus?  Nero Uh-huh. He never stayed in a dorm. Never, never, never.  Finchum Well, he   s an OSU supporter  Got some orange somewhere, huh?  Nero Oh, he   s definitely OSU to the core. (Laughs)  Finchum Well, tell me how you ended up back in Clearview.  Nero How did we end up? We   re retired. I retired from, like I said, I went to Porum, and I stayed down there four years until I got that ninth grade graduated. Like I told you, I had the ninth grade, and I found out that I had to keep them until they graduated. I got them all graduated and it was a class of thirty-eight I think it was, something like that, and they all got graduated. I told them I was walking across the stage with them. I   d be the last one to cross the stage, so we all left at the same time, and so that was in 2004. Then my husband retired in 2011, and we had no home. Oh well, we had this place. I told him whenever we retired, we were going to move back to my hometown.  33  Finchum You told him, huh? (Laughs)  Nero I told him. I said,    We   re going to have to find some place to go,    because we had sold everything in Sapulpa that we owned in Sapulpa when we moved, because we weren   t going to take care of two places. And I told him,    Whenever you retired, I was going to have a place to come to.    I wasn   t going to retire and then build something, so we had this house already built when he retired. He always knew that I was going to come back home. When my mom and dad were still alive, we always came back here, anyway, on the weekends to visit them, and he loved this place just as much as I did. He had no problem with coming back to here.  Finchum If you retired in    04, and he worked until    11, what did you do during those seven years?  Nero Oh, well, it was just about the s   I never quit doing what I was doing. I still worked a lot with OEA  Oklahoma Education Association , and then I was back here in Clearview, working with the town, doing what I do with them. I was busy with the retired educators, Oklahoma Education Association, I was busy with them. I do a whole lot of things with the Oklahoma Historical Society, so I still did that. I had plenty of stuff, and I   m still   just like with OKAGE  OKlahoma Alliance for Geographic Education , doing things with them. I was doing those tours, and those summer institutes, and so I had plenty to do. It wasn   t anything that I was bored doing. I was doing a lot with building the house. I was doing this, and I have lots of relatives around here, so I had plenty to do.  Finchum Your to-do list got longer and longer.  Nero Got longer and longer  (Laughs)  Finchum Well, how has Clearview changed from the time you were younger to now? I know it has, so tell us a little bit about Clearview.  Nero Oh, it has  Clearview has changed. Clearview when I was younger, it was   we had, oh, three stores  Well, we actually had two stores that were viable, and we had one lady that had a restaurant and a little boarding house. We had a little gas station, and there was a place for teenagers to go to. It wasn   t a club, but it was just a community hangout where this man had a little jukebox and thing in there for them.  The school had first through eighth grade. We had a basketball team I played on   I was on the track team. We had a lot of activities for the kids to do, 4-H was the biggest thing. We had   and it was called NFA and NHA, New Farmers of America and New Homemakers of America, so there were a lot of activities. The school activities, the kids got to go on summer field 34  trips. Well, in the spring time, you know, you had the school fieldtrips, which I always looked forward to going, to the zoo and the amusement park.  Finchum Tulsa or Oklahoma City?  Nero We went to both. Well, the zoo in Oklahoma City, and it was Mohawk Park in Tulsa then. I never got to go to Spring Lake because Spring Lake wasn   t always opened to blacks, back in the day. That was when you   after   you probably remember Clara Luper, when she was fighting to open up Spring Lake to blacks. I never got to go there but we went to Mohawk Park. There were a lot of people, lot of houses, and lots of people in Clearview. And today, I guess, you know, a lot of people moved away for various reasons. Jobs mostly, and a lot of different ones that graduated, they moved off, to start new families in cities, because they needed a place to go for a job.  There were just not any places around in Okfuskee County, period, for jobs, at all. As they moved away, the town just got smaller and smaller. Right now, there   s less than fifty people in Clearview. Most of the houses are all gone, there   s not any businesses. We   ve got a few people that have   we have one guy that has his own lawn service and t-shirt service in town. We   ve got an old guy that has his junk yard business for cars and parts service is down there (that we kind of wish it wasn   t there, but that   s his business). What else? Most of the people that live there are elderly. We   ve got some younger people that are there, but they   re not employable, or they   re not employed or don   t want to be employed.  Finchum Well, did it ever have a post office?  Nero We had a post office up until, like I think 1979. We had our own post office. Our zip code was 74835.  Finchum And it stopped because of population?  Nero I think the postmaster retired, and then he went to work for Weleetka, and I think it was    I don   t know if it stopped because the population or they just closed the post office because they could close it down. I don   t know if it was population or what, why they closed it. They just   I know some of the rural ones    I was thinking about Boley. I think they were going to shut theirs down, but they fought to keep their post office in there.  Finchum Is it still open?  Nero In Boley? It is     Finchum Is it?  35  Nero ...and I was knowing that they were going to shut theirs down, and I was thinking about Rentiesville  Oklahoma , and they were   I mean, I was   they were telling me about them, but they were going to shut their post office down and they were going to lose their zip code, and they fought to keep theirs. I wasn   t here during that time, but I   m not sure. We probably could have fought to even just keep our own zip code and kept our little boxes down there, but I know the post   the lady that ran the post office, she retired, and that may have been why they closed the post office.  Finchum So where do you get your mail out of now?  Nero We get it   it comes out of Weleetka. We share, and we have the Weleetka zip code. Pharoah has the Weleetka zip code, so we all have those same zip code even though we still have our own town name, we still have the post office box of   zip code of Weleetka.  Finchum Well, when you were a teenager, did you do much with Boley?  Nero We did   .  Finchum Truelove   s hamburgers is what comes to mind. Several told stories about having the best hamburger around.  Nero We did. Going back and thinking about it, you know, Boley and Clearview were rivals, but we did a whole lot of things with Boley. We shared homecomings. Boley had a band and we didn   t, so whenever we had our homecoming, we   d have Boley   s band come down and play for our homecoming. When we   d have proms   every other year, well, we   d have the prom   the high school prom would be in Boley, and then Boley would come down here and have a prom down here. We shared graduations. I graduated eighth grade from Boley.  Well, we had a   it was a whole Okfuskee County, because we were all black schools, so when we had the big graduation   when it was time for me to graduate from eighth grade, I graduated, and it was held in Boley, so all the little black towns around had a big commencement at Boley. It was about, I guess, nine or ten schools that held the eighth grade graduation at Boley, and I had my little eighth grade graduation   commencement graduation program with all the little schools that were there. It was like Chilesville, IXL, Boley, Clearview, Sand Creek. What was some of those other names of those little towns? All those little towns. We all went up there, and marched in, and had our little commencement and all that.  We come back and then you have your own little ceremony in Clearview or something, for those people that couldn   t make it up there to Boley. The next year, or the year before that   it was when I was in seventh grade, 36  Boley   they came down here and did the big commencement in Clearview, so that   s how   .  Finchum Is the school building still standing?  Nero The gym is still there. When they closed down the high school, they tore down the building, and it just went that next year. They just tore it down. I thought   it was a Rosenwald School. And I   m thinking,    Oh, wow  That would   ve been great if they   d just thought about the significance of the school, and tried to keep the building itself.    Nobody was thinking about what kind of building they had or anything like that or tried to preserve it. I asked somebody later,    Why did they close it? Why did they tear it down?    They said,    Well, they didn   t want the kids that were still on that campus to go over there and get hurt in that building or something.    Instead of trying to save the building   .  Finchum Are there other ones still standing in Okfuskee?  Nero Rosenwalds?  Finchum Yes.  Nero Well, we   just last month, we found a Rosenwald School over by   between here and Henrietta, over off of 62 Highway. Someone had turned the building into a house, and it   s still got Rosenwald written on the front door, and the bell and everything is on it. There   s a couple of them that we   ve found lately. I know that there   s one big, big building that   s just standing and it   s about to fall in, and it   s at Lima.  Finchum Okay. I know a little bit about Rosenwalds.  Nero I wish we could find some more. The historical society is looking out and they   re asking people if they know of any buildings to please let them know of buildings.  Finchum I   ll keep my ears open, too, because we   re out a lot.  Nero If you find any, let the historical society know. They   re looking for them.  Finchum That and one-room  schoolhouses  have kind of slowly disappeared, or quickly disappeared lately it seems.  Nero Really, yeah, I know it. There was   we were up   just the other day up   there   s one called White Rock. The stone is still up, and I don   t know if it was a one-room building or not, but we just drove by it the other day.  37  Finchum Those and WPA  Works Progress Administration project  ones are hard to find too.  Nero Our gym is a WPA building.  Finchum Clearview   s?  Nero Uh-huh.  Finchum Cool.  Nero It   s still up.  Finchum That   s good.  Nero We   re fixing on it right now. I wish there was some funding. If you know of anybody that has funding for WPA buildings     Finchum I   ll keep that in mind too, yeah.  Nero Keep that in mind, because we need to get it repaired. We need some money for termites.  Finchum Well, when you were in school here, was the library part of the school or did you     Nero It was. We   luckily, our building had   you know, some of the Rosenwald schools, you could get them without a library or something, and ours had a library. The thing is, I remember going in there and looking, and it had no books. The shelves were empty. They didn   t have any   they had maybe two or three books on the shelves, and it had one typewriter in there, in that library. I can remember   as I got to studying about Rosenwald schools and everything, and the building types that they have and everything, I said,    Our school,    I said,    I remembered us calling that the library.    I said,    I could remember the tables, the chairs. I remember where they were sitting and everything.    I remember that one time they said   I wanted to go in because I got interested in reading, and I wanted to go find some books and I said,    There were no books in that library     I went and told my mom, I said,    I was wanting a book, and I couldn   t find any books to read,    and she said,    Oh      Well then, there was this grocery store in Okemah, and I think it was a Safeway store, and you could get stamps at the store, and she had collected a bunch of stamps. They were doing   you could buy a set of encyclopedias with the stamps, so she went in there, and she used her stamps and bought a set of encyclopedias for me. I sat there and I think I must have read every 38  one of those encyclopedias, so she got me some books to read. I looked in there, and they were those   they were white, and they were made out of the paperboard, whatever it is     Finchum Cardboard?  Nero    cardboard books, and there wasn   t much to them. They weren   t very thick, and so they were real cheap set of encyclopedias, but they had color pictures and all this. I was like in the seventh or eighth grade, and I   d sit there, and I would just thumb through those books, and just read through those books, and read through those books, all the time, thinking. I could just   see the outside world was coming into my life  Reading about birds, I can think about birds, and then think about some other things that I was just reading. That there was probably one of the best gifts I   ve ever gotten with some stamps. (Laughs)  Finchum The green stamps or yellow? I know there were S  H  Sperry and Hutchinson trading stamps .  Nero S and H  I think it was Safeway, wasn   t it? Is that   I think that was Safeway.  Finchum I remember Top Value and S   H, but I don   t know. One was yellow and one was green.  Nero It was green. I think it was what it was, but I can remember those books, and she kept those books for a long, long time. I guess after they passed away, I think those books have disappeared. Uh-huh, but she kept them until they cleaned out the house. I don   t know what happened to them.  Finchum Did your sisters read them too?  Nero I don   t think so, not like I did. They used them every now and then, but not like I did. They did use them for a few reports or something like that.  Finchum Well, to go to a public library you would have had to have gone to Weleetka or Okemah?  Nero Yeah, we   I remember Weleetka had a public library, a small one. Okemah   we didn   t go to Okemah that much. (Laughs) You went to Okemah for groceries, and the only thing I remember about being in Okemah is you went up there to the grocery store, and we were just on Main Street and that was it. We didn   t   we couldn   t go to the movie theatre or anything like that, so I never went to a movie theatre in high school or any other thing. We were invited to go to the movie theatre in Okemah. During Christmas, they would invite all the black schools to come to the movie 39  theatre on one day. I guess that was our little gift to us, to come to the movie theatre. You   d pull up, and you   d see all the little buses from all the other little black schools up there, and they showed us Francis the Talking Mule.  That was the movie that we would see every year was Francis the Talking Mule. I said,    That must have been the movie they had stored, for us to see that over       and I think there was like, what is it? Twelve parts to that series of Francis the Talking Mule, or something like that. And my sister, she got me a gag gift. She bought me the movie Francis the Talking Mule. (Laughs) I said,    I can   t believe you did this,    I said,    That   s what we saw every year was Francis the Talking Mule,    so that   s what I saw every year was that old movie. We didn   t ever go to the movies. I said, only time that I have ever   and then some of my older cousins, that had a car or something like that, they said that they remember going to another theatre that was in Tulsa, but has since been   I mean, Tulsa   in Okemah, has since been torn down, but they   d go in the movie, and it was in the balcony, and they could only go on a certain night.  You just couldn   t go to the movies in Okemah anytime you wanted to. You had to go on a certain night, or not at all in Okemah, so we didn   t go into a library or anything like that. You could go to Weleetka down there, but not in Okemah, so that wasn   t   . The only thing I remember going up there was on Saturday. You went to one grocery store up there that they allowed you to go and charge your food, or whatever groceries you wanted, and you had a bill that you could pay once a month or every two months or something. Whenever you got paid, when you had a crop that came in, or if somebody was on some assistance, you got paid once a month. It was Sally Troves, and that   s where   that   s my memories of Okemah. I was   I think I was in college. My first year in college, I guess, was the first time I went to the drive-in theatre in Okemah.  Finchum They had one?  Nero They had one, they had a drive-in theatre up there. I   m not sure   that was the first time I   d gone. I   m sure that they may have been able to go up there before then, but that was the first time I   d ever been to there. They could have gone before then, I don   t know, but I hadn   t ever been up there at all.  Finchum Was I-40 here when you were   ?  Nero Huh-uh.  Finchum That made a difference, I bet, when it came through.  Nero I-40, my dad   s   it took part of my dad   s property. When they came, and I remember when they walked up to the door, and told my dad that they going 40  to put in Interstate 40, and he was so mad  He did not want them to take his property, and they told him   well, there wasn   t anything he could do about it. It was imminent domain. It was   they were already, been in the works for ten years, and everybody had to give up their property because it was going to come through here whether they wanted it to or not. He wasn   t the only one that was upset about it, because it just took up probably three acres of his property, but some of the people that were our neighbors and everything else, it cut right down the middle of their property. It took a whole lot more of their acreage than it took of ours. Our house was right in the way, so we had to move our house.  Finchum Did they pay him any?  Nero They paid him a little.  Finchum Not enough, I   m sure, but   .  Nero They sent out   they paid him a little bit, not what he thought it was worth. They sent out a mover to pick up our house and move it up. That year, that they moved it, he had planted corn, so he moved it up into the cornfield. Our cellar and our well used to be in the backyard, but it was in the front yard when they moved it and everything, so we sat there on the front porch and watched them build Interstate 40. The interstate wasn   t there when I was growing up, so we watched them build Interstate 40. It brought a few jobs to Clearview, and some people in the town worked on the highway. And just like I said, it   s a few of them didn   t like it because it came and took away some of their property. It wasn   t   we were the only ones, I guess, in Clearview that it actually took some of our property away. With most of the rest of them, it was other families that weren   t part of the town of Clearview, that it took.  Finchum I would think that it has contributed to the out-migration, too, from Clearview, because it   s easy to get on and go.  Nero Yeah.  Finchum Although, it might help with people coming back like you   Nero Yeah, it   s   now, it makes it easier for travel and everything like that. Because, you know, 62 Highway is right there. You can get on 62 Highway, and stay on it, and it   ll take you straight to the Capitol Building because it turns   62 is Twenty-Third.  Finchum Okay.  41  Nero Once you get into Oklahoma City, it turns into Twenty-Third Street, and Twenty-Third Street runs right into the State Capitol Building, so that   s how they went to Oklahoma City. It was a bus route and everything. You can get on 62, and go to Muskogee, so it was the highway, so it was a lot of traffic up and down 62 Highway.  Finchum Were people going to work at Tinker?  Nero Tinker? Yeah. Tinker. So the interstate brought a lot of   for us, being living on the highway, it was a lot of traffic noise, and it changed us from being a   where we lived in the country, and you could go to bed and not even lock your doors (or anything like that), to a lot of people stopping on the highway, coming over. Just pulling off on the side of the road and walking over to the house, things like that, so it got to be scary a couple of times for my parents, with strangers and things like that.  Finchum Asking to use to phone if they had car trouble or something?  Nero Yes, those kinds of things. Trying to get in, and it was kind of bad for a while because traffic   people weren   t driving as fast as they are now, and you know, there was a couple accidents and trucks and things   people   these truck drivers that were drunk and stuff, wanting you to hide their liquor, and things like that, from the police. Then other people breaking down, and there   s just people just seeing your house on the side of the road with lights on it, thinking that you   re out in the country, and they want to come in and rob you. I think a couple of times they had something like that. That   s kind of   you know, because you   re out there by yourself.  Finchum Did they have a gun? (Laughs)  Nero Yeah   Finchum Have a shotgun under the bed?  Nero Yeah.  Finchum Well, where do you go to get groceries now? Today?  Nero Well, we go to Okemah. You can go to Homeland. The people   most of them go up to Homeland. We had a Walmart for about a year, then they closed that little Walmart down.  Finchum I wondered if that   the colors matched. I didn   t know if it was a Walmart or not.  42  Nero It was. It lasted about a year. It was one of the ones that was shut down. Mostly everybody in town goes up to Homeland. A lot of them will go over to   in Okemah because it   s the closest, because we   re just six miles from Okemah. If someone wants to venture over, they will go over to Okmulgee to Warehouse or Walmart, but there   s a Homeland in Henrietta.  Finchum Okay.  Nero A lot of them, if they want something else, if they don   t want to go to the Dollar Store, or the other    Green Dollar Store    as I call it, (laughs) and they don   t want to go to Henrietta, that   s where they mostly shop is in Okemah now, because Okemah has changed a whole lot since the    60s, you know. Since Boley lost their high school, they   ve taken in a lot of the Boley kids, and there   s a lot of   now, blacks do live in Okemah, so things have changed.  Finchum And more Native Americans, too, I would imagine.  Nero Yeah.  Finchum Well, when your dad was raising cotton, is that where he would take it to the gin?  Nero Yeah  He   d take it to the gin     Finchum    in Okemah?  Nero    Uh-huh. Yeah, rode with him a lot of times up there to the gin. Take his cotton to the gin, and then we   d get   when he sold his cotton, we got three sets of clothes for the wintertime: a pair of shoes, and three pairs of jeans, and three shirts. Three little t-shirts. (Laughs)  Finchum You actually got jeans, though?  Nero Yeah, we had jeans.  Finchum You got pants?  Nero We got jeans for   yeah, those jeans, when we were little. You know, when we got big enough to say what we wanted. By that time, my dad had gotten sick and he couldn   t farm anymore. He leased his land out to somebody that grew soybeans, so then they grew soybeans.  Finchum Your shoes would have to do until spring or summer?  Nero Yeah, penny loafers and then those tied-up shoes. 43  Finchum Oxfords.  Nero Oxfords, yeah  Uh-huh.  Finchum In the summer, were you barefoot most of the time?  Nero Yeah, most of the time you went barefoot.  Finchum Me too   Nero Uh-huh.  Finchum Bee stings, lots of bee stings.  Nero Yeah, the sand   you   d get those little sand cuts under your toes. (Laughs) A lot of fishing, well, we did a lot of fishing. My sister doesn   t want any fish now, because we ate so much fish in the summertime   squirrels and rabbits. (Laughs)  Finchum Squirrels and rabbits?  Nero Squirrels, and rabbits, and quail. My daddy was pretty good at hunting, so we could live off the land.  Finchum Any possum?  Nero Oh, my mom cooked a possum once, and we said,    Don   t never bring one of those things back in the house again     (Laughs) No possum. I could eat just about anything, but I couldn   t handle no possum.  Finchum Well, did she raise chickens?  Nero Oh, yes  We had chickens. We had chickens, and pigs, and a cow.  Finchum Would she be the one that had to kill them?  Nero She would. She tried to teach me how to do it, but I couldn   t handle it. I couldn   t wring their neck. I never tried to chop off   why, I saw her chopping off the necks, but I never did. We didn   t really have to do a whole lot, we weren   t   I told you, we were spoiled. We didn   t have to, really have to work.  Finchum What was the favorite thing she made, cooking-wise, that you liked? Your favorite?  44  Nero My favorite thing, well, the dessert was she made tea cakes. Those were the best, and her thing that everybody liked was her tea cakes. Food-wise, I don   t know   she could make some pretty good fried chicken, I guess. She was a really good cook at everything she made. Everybody just loved whatever   .  Finchum Did she make lye soap?  Nero Oh, yeah.  Finchum Did she?  Nero Oh, my auntie   my Aunt Julia, she made the best peanut brittle, peanut candy. It wasn   t brittle, it was peanut candy. She made those little chunks of peanut candy. She cut them up into little squares, and she could make   that was her best thing, but her best friend was my uncle. He was my great uncle (my mom   s uncle), and his wife, Aunt Julia, and they were just best buds. She   they cooked, and they were   we were at their house, or they were at our house every Sunday, and we   d go out. They lived out kind of south and west of town. They lived in the sand, and they had a spring, and we would go down to the spring. We   d have to tote the water up from the spring, and it was probably an eighth of a mile or something like that. My uncle had a little shelf at the back door at the kitchen, and he   d put the bucket on the shelf.  The water bucket was on the shelf, and he had a dipper. I tell my kids, I said,    That was the drinking water, and that was the dipper. We all drank out of the same dipper.    (Laughs) I told them, I said,    I don   t bet you wouldn   t do that for anything in the world,    and I said,    Well, that   s what we all did. We all drank out of that same dipper.    That cool, spring water and it was on that big shelf with a galvanized bucket, a gallon bucket, and that was our water for the day.  They would go in there after church on Sunday. It was a little narrow kitchen, and it had one big, long table in it. The stove was   it was about this far away (gestures) from the table, you know, and they were go in there and cook. And Aunt Julia and Uncle A.T.  Ashord Tennerhill  would have   they raised most of their grandkids, and one of the daughters had probably about six kids, and we were all   they was all about the same age.  I don   t know how they would come up with enough food to cook for all of us, but they had a cellar that was dug down in the sand. You could go walking in there, and it would smell so clean and so good down in that dirt. You could go and get potatoes and everything else out of that cellar, and just make the biggest, nicest, old dinner out of   it might be chicken and guinea and whatever else they would cook up, but it would be so good, and biscuits 45  and everything else, cooking for a whole bunch of people, but they did some really good cooking.  Finchum Fried onions in there with the potatoes.(Laughs) Cornbread, too, or just mostly biscuits?  Nero Cornbread.  Finchum Both?  Nero Maybe cornbread and some biscuits and all that, and have enough for everybody to eat. I don   t know how they did it. It would take me all day long to cook the kind of food that they would cook. How they did it, I don   t know.  Finchum It was pre-microwave, too, huh? (Laughter)  Nero I don   t know.  Finchum Pre-microwave.  Nero I don   t know. My son-in-law says I can do it too. He says,    You can go on in and just make something out of nothing,    and I thought,    I can?    I guess maybe I can. I don   t know. (Laughs)  Finchum Chicken and dumplings?  Nero Yeah  Chicken and dumplings, that   s maybe what we had.  Finchum Well, what was Christmas like?  Nero Christmas? Back then?  Finchum Yes.  Nero Daddy would go up into the field, and we would get a old cedar tree, like two days before, because you know those things dry out pretty fast, and put up an old Christmas tree. We put something there, and we didn   t have anything so   . What was Christmas   what we got was, we would be glad to get up and we would find a pineapple, a coconut, and a basketful of fresh fruit, and we would be so happy that   s what we got for Christmas.    Wow  We got some oranges and some apples, and a pineapple, and a coconut,    and Daddy would crack the coconut and break it open. We got the coconut milk, and then he would break the coconut so we could eat the coconut, and that was what   .  46  And then we   d get a big, old peppermint stick, and then he would break that, and we would stick the peppermint stick down the orange, and suck the orange and the peppermint stick. If we were lucky, we might get a little, bitty bottle of perfume or something like that. If my mom   s sisters and them would come down from Kansas, or someplace like that, we might get a doll or something that they would bring. Every now and then, one of us would get a doll. One year, I got a wedding doll, and then my sisters, maybe they got a doll, or something like that, every other Christmas, but it wasn   t anything big. But what we were looking for was that good, fresh fruit that wasn   t canned on that fruit shelf. (Laughs)  Finchum Coconut that would be pretty exotic almost, in those days   Nero It was  It was a coconut. We didn   t get one, I don   t think, every year, but it was the fresh fruit.     There was the fresh fruit and those kinds of things that we got. I can remember just getting a little bottle of perfume and a little tricycle one time, and I   but that was it. It was just getting something that was fresh and that it wasn   t canned.  Finchum You mentioned church, would that be part of the Christmas thing too?  Nero No, that wasn   t. We   re members of the Church of Christ, so that wasn   t a big   we did do   we did go and do Christmas carols and things at school. We did that, and we   d have a big Santa Claus at school. One of my mother   s first cousins, who was   he was fat and jolly. He got his Santa Claus suit from somewhere, and he would do Santa Claus, and come into the school, and he   d go,    Ho, ho, ho  Merry Christmas     He would come in and have this sack full of this little brown penny sacks, and they would have oranges and apples, and nuts and little hard candies, and everything. He would pass those out to the kids, and we were just   for some reason, we were just all just thrilled to death to get fruits and nuts, and candies, and everything like that  That was a big treat for us to have those kinds of things for Christmas.  Finchum No wonder if you wouldn   t get them any other time.  Nero You wouldn   t get them any   not in the wintertime, you just didn   t get anything fresh fruits and I said,    That was a big thing.    We looked forward to having the Santa Claus come, passing out those little, brown sacks full of fruit, and nuts, and candies, and things like that, because you just didn   t get them then at all. You   d have Christmas programs at the other churches and things like that that we would attend on Sundays, little Christmas programs.  Finchum Well, did it snow much? Was it   do you remember many snows?  Nero I don   t remember it snowing a whole lot, at all. No, I just remember one big, big snow that we had that closed down school one time, and we had no 47  phone. See, I grew up without a phone in our house, and we had no way of knowing that school was closed, and my mama said, she said,    It   s not going to be any school today, and I said,    Yes, it is     I was wanting   I had never missed school. I was not going to miss school, and my baby sister, she couldn   t care less about going to school, and she wouldn   t get up. Me and my other sister, we got up and we said,    Well, we   re going to go down there and catch the school bus.    We had to walk a fourth of a mile to catch the school bus, so we put on our little sacks, our little, bread sack shoes. You know, we didn   t have any rubber boots, so we just got us some plastic bread sacks, and put them over our shoes, and put a rubber band around them so they wouldn   t slide off our feet.  Got out there and that snow probably was twelve feet   not twelve feet, twelve inches, or maybe more than that. It probably was up to our knees or something like that. Marched on down there, and waited and waited for that school bus, and waited and waited for that school bus. It never showed up, guess we went on back home. Mama said,    I told you you wasn   t going to have any school today     (Laughter) So we didn   t, school was out for a week. It had snowed so much, it had   yes, it was really, really bad, and I know we couldn   t do laundry or anything. Mama couldn   t wash and hang our clothes out or anything like that, and they piled up, so we ended up going to Weleetka and doing the clothes at the washhouse. You know, you called it the washhouse then (the laundromat), so we had to go and do it, because it was too cold to wash our clothes outside.  Finchum Did it have a dryer at that time?  Nero No   Finchum No. At the washhouse?  Nero Oh, at the   yeah, they had a   at the washhouse, they did.  Finchum Well, I know at your house, you probably didn   t. We didn   t either forever   Nero No. I don   t guess my mama ever had it, and she never had a dryer until they finally got where they were just too old to stay out in the country, and they moved to town. They moved to Weleetka, and so in that house, we got them a washer and a dryer. They had a place that you could put a washer and dryer, and got her a washer and a dryer so she didn   t have to wash outside.  Finchum She probably didn   t like that either, did she?  Nero She loved it  (Laughter)  Finchum She loved it  She didn   t have to go hang out clothes on it. (Laughter) 48  Nero I just told my husband, I finally got him to finally put up me a clothesline in the backyard. (Laughs) I looked around, and I   ve finally found me some clothesline. I had this lady that lived almost a hundred years old. She died a few years ago. Before she died, I told her,    Would you please let me have your clotheslines, you know, your posts, so that when you pass away, I can have them?    He went down there and got them, and then he never would put them up. I finally got him (just the other day) to finally put the poles in the ground so I could have me a clothesline, because I still want to hang my clothes out. (Laughs)  Finchum In this wind, it won   t take long to dry, and the sheets will feel     Nero Uh-huh   Finchum    so good under.  Nero Yeah. After I told him, when I took my bedspread to the laundromat, it cost me twenty dollars for that lady to wash it.    Will you please let me have my clothesline?    (Laughter)  Finchum Well, you   ve come full circle here in Clearview, from birth to back around here. You consider it home-home?  Nero Yeah, we   re trying to bring some life back into Clearview. We have   my husband and I, we   re trying to restore, get the gym all restored. We   re looking for people to donate money and everything to help get it restored. We   re working on trying to get the windows all fixed in it, and get the   looking for funding and everything like that. We got a grant last year to redo the bathrooms, and then we applied for another grant and they denied us. Said we got one last year so we won   t qualify for one this year. I   m thinking,    Well, I keep seeing some of these other towns that keeps getting grants year after year,    but that   s what they said.  Finchum Every other year then, give it a go  If they say no, try again.  Nero Yeah, so we   ll put it back on there to see if we do. We started on the Hall of Fame for the State of Oklahoma, and it   s located here in Clearview. We   re going to do a Founder   s Day, for the first time ever, in Clearview. We was hoping that we could make this a retirement community for people to come into some day. My sisters moved back.  Finchum Both of them?  Nero My baby sister passed away in    99, but my other sister retired and moved back. I had a cousin that retired this last year and moved back, so we can get 49  people to start retiring and moving back to the area, maybe we can bring this town back to life. If we could get people to sell their property. We had a lot of people that own property and won   t   and they   re not planning on coming back, but they want to hold onto their land.  Finchum And repair the buildings that are...  Nero That   s here, yeah. They won   t do that   they won   t clean their lots off or anything like that. They just want to hold onto something that   s in Clearview, but they don   t want to take care of it. That happens in all the cities.  Finchum Yeah, I think Boley was having that issue too.  Nero Yes, they do. They have the same issue, so I don   t know why, but they want to hold onto something.  Finchum Well, we   ll bring it back around to OSU, then we will close off. Are people in town aware that you have a degree from OSU? I mean the people in Clearview, do they know you have OSU     Nero Ties?  Finchum Yes.  Nero Let me think. Well, I know my sister knows that I have an OSU degree, and I suppose I probably need to let some of them know that I have a degree from OSU. (Laughs)  Finchum You need a Pistol Pete on your gate, and you   ll be good.  Nero I need a Pistol Pete, then I   d be good, to put a Pistol Pete up there  (Laughs) I don   t know if any of them know what kind of degree I have or anything like that.  Finchum Well, Clearview may not be a OSU stronghold then. It may be more East Central.  Nero No   well, you know, there   s one girl (that   s down there) that she   s an East Central grad, and has her master   s degree from East Central. My sister is an East Central grad, and   I   m trying to think who else is down there that may be college. Thinking around   oh, there   s another one down there that   s East Central, so most of the people in this area are all East Central people.  Finchum Yeah, okay.  50  Nero Yeah, but if they   ve gone anywhere else, and they got a master   s degree, and it was something   it was in education, so most of them are all in education anyway.  Finchum Okay.  Nero So most of the people in Weleetka, they   re all education. Most of the people even in Weleetka have degrees in education, so that   s just this area.  Finchum Well, when was the last time you were back on campus?  Nero Not long ago. What did we go over there   to somebody   s   oh  We were over there for   that   s where I saw Lynne  Simpson , the last time. When they were inducting somebody into a Hall   oh, it was a frat  One of the fraternities was inducting somebody into a Hall of Fame (their Hall of fame) is when I was over there, and that was in, was it October or November? I know we   re over there two or three times a year     Finchum Okay.  Nero    on campus.  Finchum Do you have a favorite spot on campus?  Nero On campus?  Finchum Uh-huh.  Nero I liked Old Central. I was over at Old Central. What was that last year?  Finchum It   s a pretty building.  Nero Old Central, and then I   another friend of mine that   s down at Connors, we went over and looked at the what used to be Murray Hall. Well, I guess it   s still called Murray Hall, where they have the history department     Finchum Okay, yeah.  Nero    and I went over looking for some of our old professors, because he was in history with me, and we saw Dr. Smith. Everybody else was gone. Let me think   oh, Donnie and I went over, we looked at the Union, the Student Union     Finchum It has changed a lot   51  Nero    and we just kind of toured all of that. The Student Union, and I   m trying to think, the   .  Finchum Not the library, huh?(Laughs)  Nero Not   well, the last time I was in that library, I didn   t even know where I was. It had changed. (Laughs)  Finchum Next time, come in and I   ll give you a tour.  Nero It had changed  (Laughter) He wouldn   t know too much about maybe how it   d changed because he didn   t spent that much time in that library, I don   t think. Not like I did.  Finchum Well, it   s a pretty campus. It   s changed a lot   Nero It   s changed a lot. I think   let   s see, the last time we were at a football game over there, it was when they had the   there was an earthquake that had happened. Oh, and then we were leaving, and the car went doing this and doing this like here, and I thought,    Why are those people behind us shaking our car?    It was doing like this, and I said,    Did somebody bump the car? It   s not anybody bumping us like this here     I got to looking on my phone (or doing something), I said,    You know what? Nobody was shaking our car or bumping into us.    I said,    We were just in an earthquake     (Laughter)  Finchum I remember that, rattled our windows   Nero Oh, we were in the car, and the car was just going like this, you know, like that. (Gestures) That was the last football game that we attended over there.  Finchum It   s been a little while.  Nero That   s been a while since we were over there for that. Usually Donnie gets invited to go at least once a year for the Regents. They invite us over once a year, but he   s got to where he doesn   t want to fight the traffic. It was just too much traffic to have to deal with going over there, and he don   t want to do all that. He said he   s doesn   t like trying to find parking, and then having to walk, and do all that so   .  Finchum Just watch it on TV.  Nero Just he   d rather stay and watch it on TV. Watch it on TV.  Finchum Well, we   ve covered a lot. Is there anything else you want to add before we close it?  52  Nero Well, OSU was an interesting place. It was fun. I enjoyed every minute of it. I got to meet a lot of good professors. I have no regrets, and maybe back in the day, that if I   d gone there to begin with, I probably would   ve enjoyed it, but I enjoyed what I got to do when I was down at East Central. I probably would   ve had the same experiences at OSU, but that was just the time.  Finchum You may have made a C in swimming there too.  Nero I may have  (Laughter)  Finchum Because I know you had to take it. I   m pretty sure you had to take it back when they required PE.  Nero I think when I went over to OSU, I did have to take some class. I took a bowling class at OSU. I don   t know why I had to end up taking that class.  Finchum And that was in the basement of the Student Union.  Nero It was  It was in the basement of the Student Union.  Finchum They took that out when they remodeled. I think that   s a shame.  Nero Yeah, I did. I took a bowling class over there. It was something to do with that Teacher Corps class that we had to take over there.  Finchum Made better than a C?  Nero Oh, yeah  I made an A in that because I already had bowling over at East Central. (Laughs) I could bowl, but I just couldn   t swim.  Finchum Anything else?  Nero Oh, I did stay in the dorms. I stayed in Willham one summer that I was over there for something. I used to sponsor   oh, I   ve done a lot of things, and I   ve sponsored a lot, so I have had dorm experience at OSU. Stayed in the dorms over there, and I tell you what, I didn   t like it because I had to go   I stayed in the dorms at East Central, and our dorms always were suites. We had   we shared bathrooms, and in Willham, you had to go to the end of the hallway for the bathrooms, and I didn   t like that. (Laughs) So I have had experiences in dorm life at OSU, but I don   t think those dorms are there anymore.  Finchum No, they   ve taken down a lot, and most of them are suites that they   ve replaced them with, so you   d like it now, I guess.  Nero Maybe that was why I didn   t go down there. (Laughs) 53  Finchum Could be. Or maybe you didn   t like orange?  Nero No, that wasn   t it. In fact, East Central is orange and black, because it   s the Tigers.  Finchum Oh, okay. Then that wasn   t it then (Laughs)  Nero That was not   it didn   t have anything to do with the colors. Nothing to do with the colors, nothing at all.  Finchum Well, we   ll close by saying thank you so much for spending the afternoon with me.  Nero You   re welcome.  Finchum Go Pokes   Nero All right, go Pokes  I   ve got some OSU stuff up there, my kids wear OSU clothes, and we got some    Go Pokes    stuff in the office upstairs so   .  Finchum There you go   -------  -------
