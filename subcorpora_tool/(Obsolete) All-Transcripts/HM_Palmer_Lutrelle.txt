Speaker 1: What's your date of birth?
Speaker 2: March 28, 1922.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where were you born?
Speaker 2: Newport News, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay, and tell me a bit about your mother, Myrtle Palmer?
Speaker 2: My mother was what I presume to be a typical housewife.  She was a stay-at-home mother, extremely supportive of my father [Lutrelle Palmer, Sr.].  She was always at his side, always assisting him.  And that was her life--my father was her life.
Speaker 1: Now, what was her background?  Where did her people come from, and do you know?
Speaker 2: Ohio.  She came from a place called Bellefontaine, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that's right outside of Dayton, you know, my hometown.
Speaker 2: I don't know where it is.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's near--Bellefontaine, Ohio, okay.  And do you know what brought her to Virginia?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she, she came with my, my father.  They met at Wilberforce University [Ohio] and ended up at Newport News, Virginia.  And I was born shortly after they came to Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your mother was from Bellefontaine, Ohio.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And she attended Wilberforce.
Speaker 2: Wilberforce.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's--they're both near Dayton, right there.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, did--what did she major in, in school?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: That I don't know.
Speaker 1: And do you know much about her family?
Speaker 2: No, I, I know very little about my, about my relatives.  Beyond my mother and father, no, I have very little.
Speaker 1: And her maiden name was again?
Speaker 2: Hathcock.
Speaker 1: Hathcock.  So she came to Newport News right after college, right, with your father?
Speaker 2: Pardon?
Speaker 1: She came to Newport News right after college with your father, right?
Speaker 2: He came 1920 or '21 [1921].  I presume it was shortly after college.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: Did she have any stories about her college life that she shared with you?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Well, what do you remember the most about your mother?
Speaker 2: I remember most how, how devoted she was to my, to my father.  She was a soulmate to my father.  That's most of what I remember about her.
Speaker 1: Okay, was she involved in civil activities or did she do anything--?
Speaker 2: No, except as the soulmate to my father, who was extremely, extremely involved.  And she always good with him, everything he did.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she never worked outside the home or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what kind of home--did you all live in town in Newport News or did you live in the suburbs--?
Speaker 2: We lived in the town, in the, I guess they called at that time, the Negro section, Marshall Avenue.  We lived in a house, modest.
Story_ID: 11554
Speaker 1: My father [Lutrelle Palmer, Sr.] was the, the high school principal [in Newport News, Virginia].  As a matter of fact, he, he founded what was then the Negro high school.  It's my recollection that that's the reason he came to Newport News to start the school.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, now, let's talk about him.  Now, do you know where he's from originally or--?
Speaker 1: Alabama, some small town in Alabama.
Speaker 2: Okay, was he raised in, on a farm or in a city or, do you know?
Speaker 1: That I don't know.
Speaker 2: Okay, but do you know much about his parents or his background at all?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay, and he--but we do know he went to Wilberforce [University, Ohio]?
Speaker 1: He went to Wilberforce.
Speaker 2: Was he about the same age as your mother [Myrtle Palmer]  or was he--?
Speaker 1: They were roughly the same age.
Speaker 2: Okay, well, what was his specialty in school?  What did he major in?  What was he--what did he specialize in?
Speaker 1: I don't know what his major was.  I, I don't know, maybe education--I don't know.
Speaker 2: Okay, but he ended up as an educator.
Speaker 1: He was an educator.
Speaker 2: And so you're saying he came to Newport News to found the school.
Speaker 1: At that time, there was no, no school, Negro children high school, could go to.  And I don't remember whether he specifically was called to start the school, but he did start the only high school in Newport News for, at that time, they called them Negro children.  In fact, they didn't even call the, the school, they called it the Negro High School.  And the thing that was remarkable about my father, he developed that school into such an excellent institution that graduates were able to go to virtually any university or college in the country without entrance examinations.  The, later--the school later became Huntington High School.  It was named Huntington High School and became known throughout the nation as one of the best high schools, Negro or white, in the country.  And that was his life, the school, oh, the, the family, of course.  But the school was him.  He was the school.  They, they called him professor, Professor Palmer.  And he, he did everything for those boys and girls.  He was not only their surrogate fathers--father, but he was the--he, he was the guider.  He, he guided them, not only gave them a tremendous education, but he provided them what was needed to become real men and women.  At the same time that he was doing all this, he was extremely active in the community.  He was way before his time.  He was head of the Virginia Teachers Association.  And at that time, teachers, Negro teachers, were paid less than white teachers, regardless of their degrees or their experience.  They were on a lesser scale.  He led the fight throughout the whole state to equalize the salaries for Negro and white teachers.  And for years this dragged on.  It went through the courts, but eventually, he won.  The other thing about him, he was dogged.  He didn't, he did not turn loose.  He was like a pit bull.  He led the fight to see to it that the first--he led the fight to bring the first black policeman in Newport News.  In those days, all the policemen were white.  He led a fight.  Eventually, one--I never will forget I--well, I have forgotten this person's name, of the first black policeman in Newport News.  And he was, he told us that he was given instruction, he could not arrest white people.  He could only (laughter), he could only arrest black folks.  But that, that was typical of the South in those days.  And the reason I said that my father was ahead of his time, he, he recognized the need to advance our people beyond where they were.  And he was not afraid.  He was not--he had no fear.  I never will forget after he was--well, after he had been principal of, of the school for many years, probably eighteen or twenty years, we, the family was eating breakfast.  And in Newport News, Virginia in those days, teachers were given one year contracts.  So you--at, at a certain time of the year, all the teachers wondered whether they were going to be there next year.  We were having breakfast and they, they published the, the new teachers, the teachers that had been hired for the upcoming year.  And I remember my wife saying to my father, "Dearie", she called him Dearie, "I don't see your name."
Speaker 2: You're talking about your mother, rather than--your mother saying to your--?
Speaker 1: My mother--.
Speaker 2: Saying to your father.
Speaker 1: --said to my father.  She'd been looking at the paper, looking to see who were the new, who were the new hires.  And he, he said, "Well, look again, I'm sure it's there."  She looked again.  Sure enough, my father's name was not there.  So he said, "What about T. Roger Thompson", a teacher, one of his teachers, and one of his lead fighters in the fight to bring equal education?  She said, "No, I don't see T.R.'s name."  And my father said, "Well, what about Ethel Parnell?"  She looked.  She didn't see Parnell's name.  So it suddenly dawned on my father what was going on.  All of the teachers and principals who had led this fight to bring about equal salaries, had been fired.  And this brought a, quite a reaction from the, the black community.  They had all kinds of mass meetings and all, made all kind of protests, and--but the newspaper said that my father was fired because of his communist leanings.  The closest thing he had to communist leanings, he was the head of a group--I don't remember if you remember the Progressive Party or not, but in the old days, the Progressive Party was the radical party.  Well, he, he was a part of that group.
Speaker 2: Yeah, who was their candidate for president or something?  Do you remember that?
Speaker 1: Wallace.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Henry, Henry Wallace?
Speaker 2: Could be.
Speaker 1: Henry Wallace.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, this would have been in what year?
Speaker 2: Oh, my goodness, this had to be early '40's [1940s].  So the black community did all that they could to save my father's job, as well as Thompson and Parnell and the other teachers who had led this fight.
Speaker 1: Now, he had been in place for almost twenty years at this point?
Speaker 2: Yeah, about twenty years.  But we, we--they were unsuccessful.  They could not do a thing.  The superintendent called my father, called him over to his office--I'm trying to remember, and told him that if he would give up this fight for equal salaries, he would give my father the same salary as the white principal, the principal of the white school.  And my father turned him down, said no way.  So all kinds of, all kinds of things happened.  But I never will forget, my father was out of work, and he got a call one day from the head of the Newport News Shipbuilding Company.  Newport News had a huge shipyard.  A man who was the head had been, had been brought in from New York who he used to be head of Madison Square Garden.  And he called my father--he had read that he had been fired.  And he told him, "I'm going to give you a job."  This is a white man now.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how did your father feel about that?  I mean, because--?
Speaker 2: He, he'd--he said, absolutely, I'll take it.  The job was an inspector in this shipyard, about which he knew nothing, but this--who was this man?  I wish I could think of his name; the head of Madison Square Garden at that time.  He just said, I, I, I want to help.  So for a while, my father was a, an inspector at the shipyard.  Eventually, maybe a few months later, he got a job teaching at Hampton Institute.  It's Hampton University [Virginia] now.  So, but this incident virtually--I always said, it killed my father.  In a year's time, he was, he was gone.  And I say that he was lynched.  He was not lynched in the usual sense, but the white folks in Newport News, Virginia lynched him by taking away his school.  And he figured it as his school.  He gave--gave his everything to that school.  And that had such a profound effect on me, I'm sure--I'm often asked why am I so militant?  Why am I am always so pro-black?  Well, I, I have to.  I--my father taught me this.  Well, I am convinced that because he lost his school, he died in--within a year's time, and he died of a broken heart.  And I, I, I was in college.  I was a youngster then, but I, I, I think I must have said, I got to do something about this.  I got--I don't know what it's gonna be.  But that's--I'm convinced that's why I became a journalist because I--well, my father had put me in journalism school.  When I graduated from college, friend of mine and I were going to start a, a cab company in Newport News.  My father shook his head, didn't much then, but a few days later, maybe a week later, he called me and told me I was going to Syracuse University.  I said, "Syracuse University?"  I never had heard of Syracuse University.  I said, "I'm gonna start a cab company."  He said, "You are going to school."  Well, my father didn't have a lot of money.  I later learned that Syracuse is a rather, an expensive school, but in those days the state of Virginia would send you to any school in the country to keep you from going to the University of Virginia.
Speaker 1: This is the repeated phenomenon in the South from what I've heard.  This is happens--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, it certainly, it certainly was true in Virginia.  And my father had heard what the--what a good journalism school Syracuse had, and so I went to Syracuse, earned my master's degree in journalism.  The state paid it.
Story_ID: 11555
Speaker 1: We have time to go back and to talk about how you felt as a child, what kind of a child you were like, what your dreams and aspirations were, and that sort of thing.  Like what--Newport News [Virginia], you all lived in the black section of Newport News--.
Speaker 2: We lived in the--.
Speaker 1: Did it have a special name?  Did they call it something.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Did they have a special name for the black section of Newport News?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: The west side of town, south side or something like that or?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: What did they call it?
Speaker 2: I don't recall that they called it anything.  We just knew that we, we lived in the black section.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In those days if you--oh, the other thing about my father [Lutrelle Palmer, Sr.], he was, he was so determined that black children be normal, he would not let his children, us, go to the theater.  The theaters--there was a black theater and there was a white theater.  At the white theater, blacks had to sit in the balcony.  He wouldn't let us go.  In fact, he wouldn't let us go to the black theater, except on occasions when we'd-- just so, begged him so.  But he was determined, I mean we, we wouldn't even think of going to the white theater and going in the back door and going upstairs.  That, that was just unheard of in my family.
Speaker 1: He was trying to shield you all from that of disappointment.
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: He was trying to shield you all from that kind of humiliation.
Speaker 2: Well, maybe, maybe so, but the more I think about it, he was just determined that, when there was a Jim Crow law, that we didn't have to obey, we just wouldn't participate.
Story_ID: 11556
Speaker 1: Can you tell us now, can you reflect on what life was like for you as a child?  I mean what kind of kid were you?
Speaker 2: What kind of student?
Speaker 1: What kind of kid and student too?  You know, what kind of little boy were you?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess--because I was the son of the professor--my father [Lutrelle Palmer, Sr.] was well known, particularly in the black community.  And because I was the son, I, I imagine I, I didn't live quite the normal life.  But everybody respected my father so, they kind of pampered me.  But I--the, the elementary school I went to [Marshall Elementary School] was near my home [Newport News, Virginia].  And I think it was kind of routine that I went there.  The difference that I recall was high school because when I went to high school, my father was the principal of the high school [Huntington High School].
Speaker 1: Now, when you were a child, did you enjoy the status of having your father as the principal of--?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sure I did.  I'm sure I did.  I can't remember specifically, but the fact that I was--well, see, and everybody called me Junior, and that made it even more, more, I was more pampered.  Even today, they think of me as Junior.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, if you did something wrong, would it get back real quick?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Well, in those days, if you did something wrong, regardless of who you were, in those extended families, sent word back to your, your family.  So, yes, I guess I had to, I had to walk a tight rope because I didn't want to do anything that would disgrace my, my father and my mother [Myrtle Palmer].
Speaker 1: So you felt like you internalized their values, and you really an obligation to--did you feel like that?  Did you feel obligated to do, to behave in a certain way?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I, I did.
Speaker 1: Well, some people would resent that.
Speaker 2: Except, I still had a streak of my father in me because I remember in high school, I led a, a strike against my father.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: I was a member of the band.  I don't remember the details, but it was something about graduation and something we didn't like.  And I led the protest against my father.
Speaker 1: Well, did you--how did your father react to that?
Speaker 2: He reacted, which was typical of him, we talked it out.  You know, he talked, he called me in, and I laid my story on the table.  And he--I don't recall, as I, as I remember--I don't remember exactly how it was resolved.  It was resolved, but I do remember that I was the ringleader in this strike.  Being the son of the professor, I had to--there are certain things I, I knew I, I just wouldn't do.  Certainly, all through--during my school days, there was very drinking and certainly no drugs.  We flirted and I remember another incident where--I don't know whether I stole or took without permission, a teacher's car and took a girl.  And we went out and did something wrong.
Speaker 1: A car?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: An automobile?
Speaker 2: Automobile.  I just took it without permission.
Speaker 1: Okay, and this was a teacher that you, you--?
Speaker 2: A teacher at the school, at, at my father's school.  And, again, my father, very stern, but compassionate, made me feel bad about it and told me how wrong I was and smoothed it over.  But I never did anything like that again.
Story_ID: 11557
Speaker 1: He was, he--would you say, I mean he--did you see him as a model for using reason to resolve conflicts?  I mean in the future and I mean as you grew older?  Now, did you, did that make an impression on you?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  I, I think I--I thought of my father [Lutrelle Palmer, Sr.], not only as my father, but as the father for all the children.  And because of his intense interests and love for these children, I have tried to follow through in my adult life--I don't know if I've been successful, but I have tried.  But he'd always had such a impact, not only on the young, but on the, the older--the teachers loved him.  They, they saw what he wanted to do for, for everybody.  About the only folks that outwardly did not like my father were white folks.  But I think a lot of them--I've always said that they may not have liked him or loved him, but they respected him.  And he had such a, such an impact upon, on me, and I think on many young people whether they were his family or not.
Speaker 1: Now, did we talk about when your father was born or did we get the date?  Do you remember when your father was born?
Speaker 2: The date he was born?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the year?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't.  And I'm not sure that I know the answer.
Speaker 1: Okay, but it sounds like he had a tremendous impact on the community.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: So many people that are stern, they think of as being--we think of as being stern, have, use corporal punishment and that sort of thing.  But you say he talked through a lot of things.
Speaker 2: Yes, he, he, he did.  He talked through.  He had a, had a talent for talking something out.  And what I did not tell you, I should have, that even after he went through all of this business of being fired, and we had to quiet a outcry from the black community, years later they named his school for him.  Right now, in Newport News, Virginia, there is a Lutrelle F. Palmer Elementary School.  And I remember that the family, we were astounded that this happened.  We went down to the, to the dedication, and it--I think after years and years and years, and maybe a new administration came.  I don't know what happened.
Speaker 1: How many years was it after he passed?
Speaker 2: Oh, it had to be fifteen to twenty years later, that they named the school--.
Speaker 1: So that would be in the '60s [1960s], in the early '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I, and in a way it, it illustrates what has--well, Newport News came through a, a period of integration.  Huntington High School, his old school, became integrated, black and white children.  The whole system changed, where there was--from segregated, separate education, to integrated education.  So the school that was named for him was an integrated school.  It's kind of--
Speaker 1: Well, that's a wonderful story.  And at least it has an ending that makes some, you know--.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --gives you hope.
Story_ID: 11558
Speaker 1: Back to your childhood, what were the sights and sounds and smells of Newport News [Virginia]?  You said it was a shipping--I mean a town heavily engaged in shipping, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Newport News Shipbuilding Company is probably one of the world's greatest shipbuilding companies.  Hardly a person lived in Newport News, at one time or another, who didn't work at the shipyard.  I worked at the shipyard; not long, but I--everybody, sooner or later, worked at the shipyard.  We're on the, on the water.  We--in my childhood, there was such, such segregation.  There were really two worlds.  Whenever we went, what we call overtown,--and here we call downtown, had to go over a bridge to the main shopping area.  And we called it overtown, whenever we went, we, we couldn't try on clothes or we couldn't buy a hot dog or, or a drink.  We, we just settled in as being Jim Crowed, discriminated against.  And apparently, most of black folks just took it as a matter of course.  And I think that's what I, I love so much about my father [Lutrelle Palmer, Sr.].  He would not take it as a matter of course.  He would do something about it, couldn't change it totally.  But he would do everything that, that he could.  So I, I grew up under Jim Crow.  And I grew up, I don't know if hating is the word, but I disliked white people.  I didn't have any contact with 'em.  I really didn't, I didn't know white people.  The, the first time I knew white people as people was when, when I went to, to Syracuse University [New York].  The first time I'd ever mingled.
Speaker 1: But in Newport News, you saw them as the cause of segregation and Jim Crow?
Speaker 2: Of course, of course.
Speaker 1: So it wasn't any mystery on anybody's part about that?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: There wasn't any mystery on anybody's part about that?
Speaker 2: No, every, everything having to do with power was in the hands of white people.  And it affected all of us.
Speaker 1: Now, what were--what things did you like about Newport News coming up? And what did you like to do when you--?
Speaker 2: Well, I, with my buddies, we, as a kid, we, we played--what did we call it?  I think we called it night trick.  We'd wait 'til it got dark and went through the alley and did kid stuff, nothing vandalous, but climbing fences and I don't know.  I guess the only thing I can remember that I really liked about Newport News, it was close to what we called Bay Shore Beach.  And we used to go to the beach and go in the water.  But I don't recall anything that I particularly liked about Newport News.  I, I don't.
Story_ID: 11559
Speaker 1: What kind of a student were you in school?  Did you like school?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I--.
Speaker 1: I know those are two different questions.
Speaker 2: No, but I had to because of who I was, I felt the obligation to be as good a student as possible.  So I, I guess I was better than the average student.  I studied.  I didn't have any choice.  When I, when I finally came to high school, I had to watch my P's and Q's because of my father [Lutrelle Palmer, Sr.].  And I was as good a, a boy as I could be because I knew if I, if I blew something, I was in trouble, although my father, he, he was very compassionate.
Speaker 1: Did you feel close to your father?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was very close to my father.
Speaker 1: Okay, ;cause you, I know you sound like you--did you feel you fulfilled your obligation as a dutiful son to be--?
Speaker 2: Well, I think I have in my adult life.  I don't know in my younger life.  I was another kid.  But I always--I don't think I really understood my, my feelings about the need to emulate my dad until later in life, particularly, after I finished college and got, got a job as a journalist, and all of this began to, to come out because when I, when I began my journalism career, it was only, it was only Negro newspapers, the Negro press, that was open to me.  And, of course, all we did at, at the, at the black press was talk about and criticize white folks.
Speaker 1: But did you--I don't know--I'm just trying to--well, you know, it's obvious that your father had a tremendous impact on you?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I'm just asking did you feel particularly close to him?
Speaker 2: I was close to him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, no question about that.
Speaker 1: Did you feel close to your mother [Myrtle Palmer]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't think quite as close as I did to my father.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother was very compliant.  She, she did what she--I guess what she thought she was supposed to do.  And she was a, a good mother, saw to it that her children were cared for and so it's hard to, to determine whether I was closer to him or to her.  They always said that, that I was my, my mother's favorite.  So I'm sure we were extremely close in that regard.
Speaker 1: But you felt equally--you felt warmly towards them both--.
Speaker 2: Oh, both of them, right.
Speaker 1: So would you had a--how would you sum up your family life and--?
Speaker 2: Good, better than usual.  I think that if everyone had as good a family life as I had, we wouldn't have this trouble that we're having today.  Yes, I, I'm very, very lucky in that regard.
Story_ID: 11560
Speaker 1: So in high school, you were pretty--how did you do in school; you did pretty good in school?
Speaker 2: I was better than average.  I probably was a, a B plus student.
Speaker 1: Did you participate in sports or any other kind of activities?
Speaker 2: No, I was not a, a participant in sports.  I played in the band.  I sang in the choir.
Speaker 1: What did you play?
Speaker 2: Trombone.
Speaker 1: Trombone, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you like music?
Speaker 2: Yeah, very much.  And I was never very good at it, but I liked it.  I still like music.
Speaker 1: Well, what's your favorite kind of music?
Speaker 2: Jazz.  I, I'm, I'm, I like the traditional jazz, Count Basie and [Duke] Ellington and Sarah Vaughan and not this new kind of stuff, which, which I don't, I don't really think it's jazz.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you sang in the choir, you said, too?
Speaker 2: I sang in the choir.
Speaker 1: What other kind of activities--were you in any school clubs or were you popular or were you like, you stayed off to yourself or--?
Speaker 2: Well, I was popular because I was the professor's son.  And I never forgot that.  Yeah, I was popular.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when--what were things like when you were a senior--?
Speaker 2: When what?
Speaker 1: When you were a senior in high school?  What was that year like?
Speaker 2: Well, I was--I don't remember any particular feeling except that I was anxious to go to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think I was anxious to go to college because it gave me a, a sense of freedom.
Speaker 1: I intended to ask you this.  Did your father treat you differently after that strike, after you and your band--?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: He didn't, okay.
Speaker 2: No, we resolved it, however, and probably never, never spoke about it anymore.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you're getting ready for college, and you were thinking about that a lot as you were graduating from high school.  Was it Huntington High School at that time?
Speaker 2: Huntington High School.
Speaker 1: By the time you graduated, had they named it Huntington?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was Huntington then.
Story_ID: 11561
Speaker 1: So you went to Virginia Union [University].
Speaker 2: I went to Virginia Union.  My major was sociology.
Speaker 1: That's a black school, right.
Speaker 2: It's a black school.  And interestingly, I thought about a ministry, being a minister, but that didn't last long?
Speaker 1: Was your family very religious in terms of--?
Speaker 2: Nah, not very religious.
Speaker 1: I know you hadn't mentioned it, so I--.
Speaker 2: My father [Lutrelle Palmer, Sr.] taught Sunday school.  I don't think we were religious any more than usual.
Speaker 1: What denomination did you all--?
Speaker 2: Well, he, he was Methodist.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, he went to Wilberforce [University, Ohio].  Did that determine any denomination on such level?
Speaker 2: I really don't know.
Speaker 1: Because Wilberforce is AME [African Methodist Episcopal].
Speaker 2: Could be.  But we, the rest of the family was Presbyterian.  And why that is, I don't know.  But we went to church every Sunday--I guess every Sunday, and went to Sunday school.  It was routine.
Speaker 1: What was your, I guess, role in the church?  Did you have a particular role to play in Sunday school, and did you take a leadership role?  Or did you--?
Speaker 2: Nah, I wasn't--I didn't have any particular role.  I was just another Sunday school student.  And we used to have church plays and what not, and I--when, when I was forced into, I did it.
Speaker 1: Were you a good orator, public speaking as a kid?
Speaker 2: Nah, not that I can remember.  I didn't do, didn't start speaking publicly until my late life, when I, when I became an activist.  But I'd never thought of myself as a public speaker.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you tell us something about Virginia Union?  I mean who founded--where did it come from, and what--did you know at the time what kind of, who--?
Speaker 2: Virginia Union is a church-related school, I guess Baptist.  The main thing to me, it was a black school.  I can't remember why I chose Virginia Union, maybe because it was--it's in Richmond and very close to Newport News.  But it's just another black college.
Speaker 1: Okay, but did you enjoy that experience?  I mean did you enjoy going--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I enjoyed it.  I, again, I sang in the choir at Virginia Union, did not participate in sports, was very active among the student body.  But I enjoyed being on my own.  I wasn't the professor's son.  And I--.
Speaker 1: You lost some of that scrutiny?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: You weren't scrutinized as much, and people--.
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't under such scrutiny.  But I changed my, my major and went into sociology.  I think I graduated, yeah, I graduated in sociology.  With no particular goal in mind.
Story_ID: 11562
Speaker 1: I was asking you if you got involved in fraternities and that sort of thing in school when you--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I was inducted into Alpha Phi Alpha, and I remember the first time I tried, I was blackballed.  I can't remember why.  But again, my father [Lutrelle Palmer, Sr.] stepped in and soothed my ruffled feathers, told me I had to try again.  I did, and made it.  Later, I discovered that fraternities, for me--well, they were not for me.  I, I wasn't, I wasn't heavy on the social scene.  Fraternities are heavy on the social scene.
Speaker 1: Why not?  Why didn't you, you know--a lot of young people are very--the social life is their number one priority.  Why weren't you like that?
Speaker 2: I, I don't know why.  I wasn't--this is not to say I was antisocial.  But I didn't make that priority, and I got disgusted with my fraternity because that seemed to be all they were interested in.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what were you interested in?
Speaker 2: I wanted to do something--I'm not sure I knew what, but I wanted to do something more constructive.  But they wanted to have dances and parties and so I, I went along.  But as soon as I graduated, I, I put the fraternity down.  I never joined the--what do they call them?
Speaker 1: Alumni chapters?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I never--I don't go to the, the group here in Chicago.  And I don't associate myself as a, as an Alpha.  I just, I think they, they could do better in terms of goals.  But I, I remember the one professor that I will never forget, his name was Pat McGuinn, a black man, but--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Not Irish.
Speaker 2: --doesn't sound like it. But he seemed to give me something that the others didn't give me.  He--and I'm, I'm not sure, but I never will forget him.  He, he kept behind me and inspired me and saw to it that I did what I was supposed to do.  Virginia Union was just another phase in my life.
Speaker 1: And a small school.
Speaker 2: It was very small, very small.
Speaker 1: And how do you spell McGuinn?
Speaker 2: M-C-G-U-I-N-N, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I never will forget how--maybe because his was Pat McGuinn, but he, he--.
Speaker 1: What did he teach?
Speaker 2: He--social, took--taught sociology.  But he really, he inspired me sufficiently that I have never, never forgotten him.
Speaker 1: Were there any alternatives to the social life that you didn't, didn't really cater to that much?  What other--were there any sort of intellectual stimulation, organization stimulation, any other kind of activity at Virginia Union that attracted you?
Speaker 2: No, this isn't intellectual, but one thing we used to do, right behind us--behind the university, was a little settlement where they made booze, homemade booze.  And we used to, on weekends, the fellows used to go there and get jugs and I used--I was drinking then.  And we would be students.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember that.
Speaker 1: You all were drinking like college students?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there's nothing else that you remember or any activities that you--?
Speaker 2: Well, the other thing I remember--I wasn't a part of it, but we had a heck of a, of a basketball team; called them the dream team.  And we reveled in, in our basketball team.
Speaker 1: Who was on it?  Can you remember any of the outstanding players?
Speaker 2: Nah, I don't remember--none of them as I recall, went on to pros, but they were a great college basketball team.
Story_ID: 11563
Speaker 1: So at Virginia Union [University], you got a degree sociology there, right?  And you, you said that your father influenced you to go to Syracuse [University, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess I--while I was at Union or just after, was when I went in the Army.
Speaker 1: Okay, would you tell us about that?
Speaker 2: And I was--?
Speaker 1: Were you drafted?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Were you drafted?
Speaker 2: Nah, let's see, was I drafted?  No, I, I volunteered because I had a great offer.  I don't know if you remember--what do they call 'em?  There was a quartet here--.
Speaker 1: Singers?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Singers?
Speaker 2: Singers, yeah.
Speaker 1: Not the Mills Brothers or?
Speaker 2: Nah, but they were, they were real good.
Speaker 1: Deep River.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Deep River.
Speaker 2: Deep River Boys.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: Right, Deep River.  And I was offered--I don't remember why, but I was offered to join--they, they, they were in the Army, and one of their guys, something happened to him, and they needed, they needed another guy.  And I was offered the--to take his place.  So I went to the Army--I went in what they called Special Service.  And all we did, we didn't fight, we, we sang.  We'd go on troop ships, back and forth, the battlefield, entertaining troops.
Speaker 1: Now, is this during World War II or is this?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, during World War II?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So--.
Speaker 1: Did you leave the country?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, we used to, we used to go--we used to go on troop ships, when ships would be, when they would take ships to whatever country, they would, we'd go along as, as entertainers and entertain them on the way and whoever we would bring back, or while we were there.  We, it was quite a, quite an experience.  We became quite famous in army circles as a quartet, and I never shot a gun, thankfully.
Speaker 1: So you had a career as a singer there for a while?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So when I, when I came out, that was when I went to Syracuse.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I came out--.
Speaker 1: Okay, what countries did you go to when you were with the Deep River Boys?
Speaker 2: Oh, we went to, we went all over Africa, Germany--I, I sometimes, I wouldn't even--we, we were just on the ship, and I don't know where we were.  But we would go to various countries that we were engaged in.
Story_ID: 11564
Speaker 1: It was then that I came out [of the military], that I was gonna start this taxi company.  And my father [Lutrelle Palmer, Sr.] insisted that I--he didn't insist it.  He just, to--not my knowledge, he just wrote out and enrolled me in Syracuse, journalism.  That was really the first time I had genuine interaction with white people.  There weren't but two blacks in the journalism school.  I, myself and a brother from Africa named Aggrey.
Speaker 2: How do you spell that?
Speaker 1: A-G-E--, A-G-G-R-E-Y.
Speaker 2: Aggrey, yeah, okay.  So he was the--.
Speaker 1: His, his father or grandfather--.
Speaker 2: James Aggrey.
Speaker 1: --had a name in Africa.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He was well known in Africa.  Any how, we were known as the Gold Dust Twins because we didn't have any social life so all we did was study.
Speaker 2: Now, who were the original Gold Dust Twins, just for the sake of those listening to this that haven't been exposed to this?
Speaker 1: I--the Gold Dust Twins, as I recall, were some kind of cleaning--it was some kind of cleaning product.
Speaker 2: The twins were like--.
Speaker 1: And they had on the box two black faces. I--but they called us the Gold Dust twins.  And we, we made all A's.  I mean we just, we just didn't do, do anything but study and make good grades.  In fact, I became the assistant--what do they call them, when, when--.
Speaker 2: The graduate assistant.
Speaker 1: Graduate assistant.  And I used to teach a class of undergraduates.  So I made quite a record at, at Syracuse [University], mainly because it was nothing else to do but study and do right.
Speaker 2: So it wasn't much of a social life for you?
Speaker 1: No, no social life.
Speaker 2: And Mr. Aggrey, I guess.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Okay, was this of your own choosing or was it imposed upon you that you had no social life?
Speaker 1: Well, that, that was the--that's the way it was.
Speaker 2: This is New York, you know.
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: This is not the South any longer.  It's New York.
Speaker 1: Nah, it's not the South, but, and it was not Chicago either.  There were very, very, very few black students, period, at Syracuse.  I didn't know then, but it's quite an affluent school, and had a very, very good journalism school.  So I had a good experience at Syracuse.  I think that was about the time that I, I became socially alert, aware.  And when I finished Syracuse, I got my master's--oh, that was another thing that my father did for me.  I flunked the, the German--see, you have to take a language proficiency.  And I flunked that.
Speaker 2: At Syracuse?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, and that's uncharacteristic of what your other grades, right?
Speaker 1: That's right.  And I, I was, I was really down.  But my father, again, insisted that perk up, got me a tutor, and put me through the paces.  And I passed it later.
Speaker 2: What do you think the problem was?  I mean--?
Speaker 1: I don't know.  I don't know.  I just didn't, I just couldn't, I just couldn't learn it.  I don't think I was particularly interested, but, but I had to pass it in order to get my degree.  But I finally did, and--.
Speaker 2: Okay, did you have any outstanding teachers at Syracuse, I mean and how did you feel about them?
Speaker 1: Well, the dean of the school--I wish I could think of his name, the one who, who got me the teaching assistant, he took a liking to me and did everything he could to help me.  As a matter of fact, once when he went on vacation, he left me as the housekeeper.  I stayed at his house about two weeks.  I can't think of his name, but he was a dean, and he saw something in me that made him want to help me.  And he did.
Speaker 2: Did you all have a close relationship?
Speaker 1: I don't know if you'd call it close.  Teacher, student relationship.  But he--I think it was a little more than that.
Speaker 2: So he saw something in you that he liked, and--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and he pushed me, pushed me hard.  So, let's see, that would have been the early '50s [1950s], I guess or late '40s [1940s].
Story_ID: 11565
Speaker 1: Then I came out [of Syracuse University, New York]--I'm trying to think why I went to the University of Iowa for my Ph.D.  I think I just decided to stay on in school.  I didn't have a job.  So I went to the University of Iowa.
Speaker 2: Was there any particular why you chose University of Iowa over any other school?
Speaker 1: It had a--.
Speaker 2: Did they offer you any money or anything?
Speaker 1: --outstanding school of journalism.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I had a good experience in Iowa.  Again, the whole racial thing came up.
Speaker 2: (off-camera interruption)
Speaker 1: Hold on a second.
Speaker 2: So you're at the University of Iowa in this great journalism school--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, at the, at--this is Iowa City, Iowa.  There weren't many blacks at, at the University of Iowa.  As a matter of fact, none in the dormitories.  The only, only place we could stay were with black families in town.  And the black families in town made a, kind of an industry out of keeping students.  So I stayed with other students at a black family.
Speaker 2: Do you remember any of the other students that were with you?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: Can you remember the names of any of the other students that were in school with you, black students or, or white ones, any students? If you can't, that's okay.
Speaker 1: No, I, it's terrible, but I don't.  But we used to--we couldn't get our hair cut in Iowa City.  So one thing we used to do, every other weekend or so, we'd organize a party and go to Cedar Rapids, about twenty, twenty-five miles away and, and get our haircuts, and have a little fun while we were over there.
Speaker 2: Cedar Rapids was a little bit different from Iowa City.
Speaker 1: Cedar Rapids was a larger city and had quite a few black people.  So I presume there was a, a black barber there, and he took care of us.  I was working on my Ph.D. and I did not complete it.  I completed all of the coursework.  I started on my dissertation, but by then--let's see, I'd married my first wife.  And--.
Speaker 2: Did you marry in Iowa?
Speaker 1: No, Chicago.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  Was she from Syracuse or where did you meet her?
Speaker 1: Here.
Speaker 2: Here in Chicago?
Speaker 1: See, I left, I left the University of Iowa to come to Chicago to do my dissertation.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I made arrangements with the ['Chicago] Defender' to use their files, and I was gonna do a twenty-five year--what do they call it?  Any how, I was gonna research the 'Defender' for the last twenty-five years.  And I came here and worked at the 'Defender' and worked at my--on my dissertation.  But I got an offer of a job at Fisk University [Tennessee], director of the news bureau.  So I went to Fisk and in packing to go to Fisk, my dissertation got lost, and all of my research--.
Speaker 2: That must have really been a--.
Speaker 1: --was lost.  And at first I, I just, I just--I was heartbroken.  Later, I, I'm glad that I didn't get the Ph.D. because if I had received the Ph.D., I would have gone to some college teaching--.
Speaker 2: Yeah,--.
Speaker 1: I never would have become the activist, which I think really is my life.  I would have been lost on my campus.  So I'm, I'm, I'm glad I never got the Ph.D.
Story_ID: 11566
Speaker 1: So you're at Fisk [University, Tennessee], you went to Fisk and, to be director of the news bureau?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I had been--.
Speaker 1: Were you depressed at this time?
Speaker 2: Depressed?
Speaker 1: Yeah, cause you lost your Ph.D., I mean you lost your dissertation?
Speaker 2: Nah, I, I was unhappy, but I, I didn't, I, I wasn't, I wasn't greatly unhappy.  But I, I didn't stay--you see, I had been working at the ['Chicago] Defender', and the 'Defender' had sent me to Memphis to edit the 'Tri-State Defender'.
Speaker 1: Right, the southern version of the 'Defender', I guess.  Is that what it was, a southern version of the 'Defender'?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It cover Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee.
Speaker 1: And at the time, for the record, just for the record, what was the importance of the 'Chicago Defender'?
Speaker 2: Well, the 'Chicago Defender' at that time, the 'Chicago Defender' was probably the number two black newspaper in the country.
Speaker 1: And number one would be?
Speaker 2: Number one was the 'Pittsburgh Courier'.  And Memphis was a, a dog.  It was one of the worst southern cities in the country.  I didn't realize it.  It was terrible, and me, with my, with my attitude, I didn't fit at all.  They burned a cross in front of my office.  They tried to run me down in my car.  I got thrown out of a jail in West Memphis, Arkansas by the police, not thrown in jail, thrown out of the jail, beaten.  Oh, it was, it was a terrible experience, so much so that my first wife finally told me she was coming back to Chicago, and I, I could if I wanted to, but she was definitely coming back.
Speaker 1: She was gone.
Speaker 2: So she came back to Chicago.  I came back a little later at the 'Defender', but see, I went, I, I worked for the 'Defender'. I, I quit the 'Defender' three times.  And this time took.  So I came back to Chicago, worked for a short at Provident Hospital, director of the news bureau there.  And I had been working with the black press for quite a while.  And a friend of mine, his name is Ernest Rather, I think he's deceased now, he kept on telling me that I should work for the white press, that I--my talent was such that, that I should go to the white press.  And he had a contact with 'Chicago's American', which was the afternoon paper owned by the ['Chicago] Tribune'.  And he used his contact after convincing me--I did not want to go.  But he said that's what I needed to do, and I did.
Story_ID: 11567
Speaker 1: So we're about 1960.  And--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And a friend of yours urged you to apply for a job at the 'Chicago American' [sic, 'Chicago's American']?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I resisted because I, I did not particularly want to work for a white press. But I--.
Speaker 1: Why not?  A lot of people, as they go to college, they aspire to work for white people and make more money, more prestige and--.
Speaker 2: Well, that's right, but--.
Speaker 1: They see their success being at--.
Speaker 2: Well, after I went, I found out why I didn't want to go.  It was terrible.  You talking about racism.  The only thing, the only way I survived there, I was put on what they called the graveyard shift, from midnight to six or seven o'clock in the morning.  The editor on that shift--I never will forget him.  We called him 'Romie', his name was [Harry] Romanoff, he, he liked the way I wrote.  See, on a graveyard shift, almost everything you do is rewrite.  You take a story that's been published and you dress it up and get it ready for the next day.
Speaker 1: So, it's not really news.  It's rehashing the old.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.  So, it got to the point that all the big stories for overnight, he'd give to me.  He liked the way I handled them.  He just--it got to the point that the others on the staff complained.  But he didn't give a damn.  Anyhow, my byline was appearing on the front page, regular.  So I got a call from the 'Chicago Daily News', which was a competitor, asking me to come over and talk to 'em.  They didn't know I was black 'cause when I walked in, his jaw dropped.  But they asked me would I come to the 'Daily News'.  I said, I hesitated, and he said, "I'll tell you what.  We want you to write a column, once a week from the black perspective."  Well, you know, that hooked me.  I, so I said, "Well, absolutely."  So I switched to the 'Daily News'.
Speaker 1: Now, when you were at the 'Chicago American', were there any other black employees?  I mean, any black writers?
Speaker 2: As I recall, not--I don't think there were but two or three of us.
Speaker 1: Out of a staff of--?
Speaker 2: Oh, fifty or sixty.  And we used to, we used to, whenever we had a problem, we, we cooked up a scheme whereby the three of us would come, say maybe to my desk or one of the other guy's desk, and we'd have a huddle, right in the middle of the, of the newsroom.  And they knew we had to be talking about something that had to do with race.  And they, they, they kind of, they didn't like that.  Anyhow when I went to the 'Daily News', I thought I had seen the tops on racism.  But I had not.  They did everything at the 'Daily News' that they hadn't done at the 'American'.
Speaker 1: Well, you know the question?  Well, what did they do?
Speaker 2: They would only give me certain stories.  They would--I never will forget.  I went to--they assigned me, and they, they were careful what they assigned me to.  They sent me one day to the Drake Hotel.  There'd been a murder at the Drake Hotel.  And I went to Drake Hotel and started in, and the bell--and the doorman asked me what did I want?  And I told him, I showed him my press card, where I was going.  He said, "All deliveries have to go through the back."  I said, "Are you kidding?"  I said, "I'm a reporter."  I showed him my press card.  And I had to raise hell just to get in.  And after I got up to the floor that the murder was on, I was stopped by detectives, and they wouldn't let me go into--with the other reporters, until finally, I saw a reporter I knew, a police reporter.  And I beckoned to him, and he came.  I told him what my problem was, and so he went over to the--who was in charge and got me in.  My column, every Saturday, on these big newspapers, a columnist sends his copy to the editor of the editorial page.  My column had to go straight to the editor.  Now, the editor is the top boss.  My column always had to go--Roy Fisher, will never forget him--my column went to Roy Fisher.  And we used to have, I mean we used to have--we used to have it.  He said, you got to change this, you got to change that.  Well, at first I would, I would change it.  I knew, and I--but after awhile, I started balking.  I--so it was, became a regular that Thursday or Friday, Roy Fisher and Lu Palmer would have it.
Speaker 1: Well, was it a custom of the editorial staff at the 'Daily News' to argue with columnists who were writing opinion, or they, I mean?
Speaker 2: Nah, that is not--well, I don't know whether it was a custom.  It's not supposed to be a policy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But ordinarily, a columnist, he would send his copy to the--to the editor or editorial page.  He might see a word that's misspelled or punctuation or--but he wouldn't change the thought.
Speaker 1: Wouldn't mess with the contents.
Speaker 2: No, the content.  But Fisher, he would insist that I change my stuff, until I just finally--I told him I wasn't gonna do it.  And it got to the point that I would submit my column, and he'd reject it totally; it wouldn't run.  So I remember one night during the Jeff Fort days, gangs and what, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, Jeff Fort, tell us who Jeff Fort was.
Speaker 2: Jeff Fort was the leader of the biggest gang in Chicago [Blackstone Rangers].  And his, his second in command, Jeff's second in command was named Bey, B-E-Y, Charles Bey.  And they had arrested Bey, police, on a murder charge.  He changed--they claimed he killed a cop.  Well, to make a long story short, I went to a press conference called by the gang and made arrangements--no, one of the fellows told me that Bey wanted to give himself up.  But he was afraid.  So I said, maybe I can help.  So I made arrangements with him that Bey could turn himself in to me at the 'Daily News', and they would--cops weren't gonna come in the 'Daily News'.  And we agreed.  So I, they sent word to me where to pick him up and all of that.  And I wrote, I called my editor, the same Roy Fisher, and told him at such and such a time I would have Bey at the 'Daily News'.  Sure enough, we managed to get him there.  And before they took him downtown, they called a, they called a judge, a judge called the police, and they escorted him downtown.  And I told him, told Fisher to call a photographer and take a picture of him naked because they, they might beat him up.  Then I said, I'm going down with him to the police station.  Now, while I went with him to the police station, when I came back to write the story, the editor had written the story.  And, of course, he had written the way he wanted.  And he said the 'Daily News'--he said, Bey had surrendered to the 'Daily News'.  And I, I hit the ceiling.  I said, "Oh no, I ain't gonna stand for that."  I said, "You, you don't--you haven't been writing the stories.  Why'd you take this story?"  He, I--so I called Jeff Fort.  I said, "Jeff, you'd better come down here and bring some of your guys 'cause they messing with Bey."  And about fifteen, twenty minutes, security called upstairs and said the Blackstone Rangers are downstairs.  And they came upstairs, and we went in Fisher's office, and Roy Fisher changed his mind.  I wrote the story the way I wanted to write it.  He has never, he'd never forgive me for that.  Then finally--and this was--not to this extreme, but this kind of thing went on all the time.  So finally I've forgotten the story, but he messed with another one of my stories.  It involved Charles Hurst, remember Charlie Hurst.
Speaker 1: Right of Malcolm X.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Malcolm X.  And--.
Speaker 1: He was the president of Malcolm X College.
Speaker 2: Right.  And I, I, I told him I wasn't gonna stand for it.  I called [wife] Jorja [English Palmer], I said, "Jorja, I'm quitting."  She said, "Go on have, get a cup of coffee and cool down."  So I got a cup of coffee, but I didn't cool down.  I came back.  I said, "I'm quitting."  She said, "All right, if you say so."  So I wrote my letter of resignation, told 'em I would not stand for them, any, any further, doing what they're doing to me.
Speaker 1: Had you thought about that for a long time, basically or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'd thought about it.  But I, I hated, I hated to give it up.  I made good money, and I had a good audience, and a circulation of almost a half million.  And, you know, anyhow, I quit.  I wrote my letter of resignation.  Fisher wrote it back--I, I told him two weeks.  He wrote, he wrote right back, you don't need to wait two weeks.  Your check'll be ready in, tomorrow, and pick it up.  So I quit.  And I vowed, in fact I had a press conference, little ol' me, I had a press conference, and vowed never in life would a white person edit anything that I wrote.  And no--none has.  Everything I have written since have gone through black hands.
Speaker 1: Now, someone would probably want me to ask--?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: I probably should ask this, and this--and the question is this:  Do you think that it was because he was white that he edited your work the way he did or it was because he was just a peculiar--I mean he was not a good editor?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, no, no.  A good editor couldn't have gone as far as he went.  He was at the top of the 'Daily News'.  The editor.
Speaker 1: So he went to the top of his profession.
Speaker 2: The editor.  There's no other reason.  And, and because he's white, he probably just didn't understand my feelings, why I felt that way, why I reacted that way, because I've had white editors I've got along with wonderful.
Story_ID: 11568
Speaker 1: But, I just decided--well, by then I had been through a lot of experiences.  And I had come, I, what I would call, of age, when, activism.  And I was--by then, I had started the radio show.  I was doing 'Lu's Notebook'.  And I had, I had developed in me an ideology that I just could not, I could not change.  So I left the ['Chicago] Daily News', had this press conference.  Everybody, I mean--I won't say everybody, so many people said I made a mistake.  In fact, Mike Royko, remember Royko?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Royko wrote a--.
Speaker 2: He was a columnist for the, first the ['Chicago] 'Sun-Times', I guess, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And then the, yeah, the 'Sun-Times' then, right.
Speaker 1: Later, the ['Chicago] Tribune'.  He, he was writing a piece for 'Chicago Journalism Review', and he, he wrote a piece, he was wondering what, what--in order words, had I gone crazy, 'cause I had started my own newspaper then.  He said, why would I leave a, a newspaper with five hundred [thousand] circulation and have a newspaper where hardly anybody gonna read it?  Well, the first thing I did with my newspaper was answer him.  And I--my, my point was, however many readers I may have with the 'Black Express', I know they are readers that understand what I'm saying.  I might have 500,000 readers at the 'Daily News', most of them can't imagine what I'm really trying to get across.  So I started 'The Black X-Press'.  I, the only way I could start it, I borrowed money from a dear friend of ours--he's dead now, Dr. Clark, Dr. William Clark.  I started the paper and on the, in the first issue, my headline was here is the column the 'Daily News' refused to run.  They would not run the column I had written about the Black Panthers.  So I ran it in my newspaper.  I, and I said to myself, maybe it won't, but a dozen people read it, but it's there to be read.  The paper lasted fourteen months.  We caught hell.  I made the crazy mistake of not accepting white advertising.  Everybody, and my wife [Jorja English Palmer] included, told me I was making a mistake.  Dr. Clark told me I was making a mistake, but I was stubborn.
Story_ID: 11569
Speaker 1: These are--the vow never to work for a white editor again and now, not to accept white advertising, are these like issues of control you were dealing with?  I mean, and power, in terms of what you could or could not write?  I mean were you trying to make sure that you could write to write what you wanted to write.  Is that fundamentally it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I think, I think I was, I was saying, I no longer will be controlled by white people.  I've been controlled by white people all my life, and at least on my, on the newspaper, I will control what goes in that newspaper.  And I will control who edits what I write in the newspaper ['The Black X-Press'].  So the matter of control was a matter of--I, I'm sure it's, it's ideology, that we have--and, and I learned.  I, I think I got this from my father [Lutrelle Palmer, Sr.].  White folks have controlled us all our lives.  And there are certain areas in which I am going to control myself.  Now, this is difficult.  I couldn't, I couldn't get enough advertising from black people.  I got good circulation.  I had good circulation.  This matter of control showed itself the second issue of my newspaper.  My--the printer, who was white--I couldn't find a black printer who would who would print a newspaper, certain articles, he would not run.  He just wouldn't run--he wouldn't type 'em--he wouldn't set 'em in type.  And my second issue--and it's historical, I wish I could find it, had a dozen or more blank spaces.  And I put it on there, "this story, the printer would not print this story".  And there's certain, certain things that we just cannot control.  I could not find a black printer who could print a newspaper.  So I had to use this white.
Speaker 1: That's incredible, I mean a lot of people looking at this, I mean looking at this interview in the future would just find that so hard to believe.  But that's one of the realities of the '60s [1960s] and maybe even now in some places, but they just refused to print certain articles.  A printer is now trying to exercise editorial control over you.
Speaker 2: It's, it's just--it's just a fact.  The biggest publisher in, that we know, who is black is John [H.] Johnson.  He can't find a black company, printing company to print his, his newspaper--his, his magazines.  I'm not saying that he has tried.  I don't know.  But there is no black printer who could handle 'Ebony' and 'Jet'.  And my newspaper was nothing like, you know, that, that size.  Mine was just a little, weekly newspaper.  Well, during all of this I think my activism began to emerge.  I tried to be an activist, but activism and journalism just don't mix.
Speaker 1: Well, why not?
Speaker 2: Because the tenents of journalism are that you must be objective, which is crazy.  You can't be objective.  But all publishers, and well, almost all publishers, have only one thing in mind.  And that's the bottom line.  That means advertising.  If you don't have advertising, you don't have a newspaper or a magazine to print.  Therefore, you've got to toe a line if you want advertising.  And that's just a fact of life.  Well, my wife [Jorja English Palmer] and I were talking the other day about Bill Maher, who was just put off the air.
Speaker 1: He's the host of--.
Speaker 2: 'Politically Incorrect'.
Speaker 1: Right, on TV.
Speaker 2: He's, says things that--.
Speaker 1: ABC [American Broadcasting Company] television.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he says things that, that don't, don't make the establishment happy.  So the advertisers quit advertising that show.  So they canceled him.
Speaker 1: So in some ways, his activism is limited by the activism of his advertisers?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: His activism is limited by the, or his ability to express his opinion is limited the imagination of his advertisers?
Speaker 2: Exactly.  So that's just a fact in, in journalism.
Story_ID: 11570
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you who some of the columnists were for 'The Black X-Press'.  And I've seen an edition and it includes a lot of fascinating people.  Can you talk about some of the columnists and some of the exposure that they got as being the--?
Speaker 2: Some of the what?
Speaker 1: Some of the exposure they got to the larger black world, out of Chicago, cause I know the paper was distributed all over the Midwest, and is this true?
Speaker 2: I'm, I don't, I don't follow you.
Speaker 1: You know, I'm just saying that 'The Black X-Press' had a wide distribution, not only in Chicago, but over other cities.  And I just wanted you to speak that, to confirm that as being true or not.  I mean is that, is that true?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I don't know.  We had wide circulation here in Chicago.  I'm told across the country, but I can't confirm that.  Our columnists, for the most part, were activists.
Story_ID: 11571
Speaker 1: I was asking you about the columnists for 'The Black X-Press', some of the people who wrote columns, 'cause it wasn't just you writing.
Speaker 2: Oh no, it wasn't just me.  Most of our columnists were activists.  Bobby Wright, as you remember--I think Frances Cress Welsing, Conrad Worrill, Mark Starks, my wife, Jorja [English Palmer].  The, the paper sought to have a nationalist bent.  By nationalist, I mean the need for black people in this country to become a nation and to act like a nation.
Speaker 1: You mean a sovereign nation or?
Speaker 2: Well, maybe sovereign, I don't know, but, but have the characteristics of a nation, have its people have loyalty to it, them, each other.  And even nationalism has many definitions.  But we, through 'The Black X-Press', we opened up our columns, news columns and opinion columns, to people who ordinarily wouldn't have any, an audience.  Each, each week we did a, a long piece on somebody or something.  And education, the education of our people was a major topic, but not education as you usually think of education.  Education as we think of it, is really nothing but sustaining the status quo, seeing to it that people know and understand that which will keep those in control, in control.  So we, we hoped--and I think we succeeded for our short life, that we got people thinking and thinking about how we control, how we can control ourselves, rather than be controlled by other people.
Speaker 1: So getting back to nationalism, I mean we had just come out of--at the time you formed that in the early '70s [1970s], the nation had just come out of this great push for integration, and, you know, Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] died in '68 [1968], his message, black and white together, and we shall overcome, and I mean how did you feel about all that?  I mean how did you become a nationalist?
Speaker 2: Well, I contend that--and many people do not agree with this, I think the worst thing that ever happened to black people was integration.  I really do.  I think we were better off, not integrated than we are when we are, so-called integrated, or when we believe in the concept of integration.  I think the concept of integration itself is, is very faulty and very dangerous.  It suggests that we depend or we must have someone else to do for us, rather than doing for ourselves.  So that is probably one of the reasons why the newspaper did not succeed from that advertising standpoint, because people do not really understand the need for independence, rather than dependence.  And to me, integration leans towards dependence.
Story_ID: 11572
Speaker 1: I think a lot of people think of integration in the same breath as they do civil rights.  Now, do you think that the Civil Rights Movement of the '60s [1960s] improved life on any level for us?
Speaker 2: Well, the only thing wrong from my standpoint with the Civil Rights Movement was that it was based on integration.  It was faulty from the beginning.  I used to--I don't any more, I used to speak a good bit when--on King birth--King's birthday [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  And I made two points.  I stopped making them because people did not--either didn't understand or didn't want to understand it.  King's philosophy was built on two faulty premises.  Number one, integration and number two, nonviolence, which does not mean that I agree or I condone violence.  It does mean, however, that in a violent world, it takes more than nonviolence to make it right.  So integration--just look today.  I had a friend--what is his name?  Well, he used to say all the time, we--he's asked--Nahaz Rogers, you remember Nahaz.
Speaker 1: Right, he's a economic--.
Speaker 2: Yeah--.
Speaker 1: --spokesman for self help projects in the community.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, can you spell his name for--?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Can you spell his name for the sake of the--?
Speaker 2: N-A-H-A-Z, Nahaz Rogers.  He's dead now.  He used to call my show all the time.  But he, he said just, just think of the old days how many drugstores we had on the corners, corner drugstores, not illegal drugs, but drugstores.  How many do you have now?  You don't have hardly any now.  In the days of, before integration we had to patronize each other.  We had to if we wanted it.  But now, we--it, it appears that we go out of our way to give white people our money and go out of our way not to give black people our money.  I used to have a little store, a little store.  And I use it as this example.  I used to--the, the man who brings the bread for me to sell brings bread for Jewel [Osco Grocery Store].  He may drop off a dozen loaves for me and a hundred dozen for Jewel; same bread, same wrapper, the same date stamped on it, same price.  But our people would walk past my store and buy the bread at Jewel.
Speaker 1: Now, what do you, what do you suppose the reason for that is?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What's the reason for that?  Is there a reason for that?
Speaker 2: Something's wrong with our, our, our minds, our heads.  That's the only thing I can think of.
Speaker 1: Does this have anything to do with the educational process you were talking about?
Speaker 2: Yes, the education process is designed to keep the status quo.  So our children are taught this.  Our children--and the media, probably equally as strong as the education system.  But the media is a part of the education system.  We teach our people these things.  And we have not learned how to, to over come them.
Speaker 1: So 'The Black X-Press' was, was designed as a vehicle for, to deliver a message of black nationalism, meaning unity and economic solidarity at least, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, the only problem was we didn't have a wide enough audience.  That's the, that's the big problem.  You can't do it with one medium.  You can't do it with one, one newspaper or one broadcasting station, like WVON now, here in Chicago, where I used to have a talk show.  We tried, but we can only reach a small portion of our, of our people.  This has to take on widespread importance and dimensions in order to--a good example of what you can do with, with activism, is the election of Harold Washington.
Story_ID: 11573
Speaker 1: Can we go back to the beginning of 'Lu's Notebook' 'cause that, it played such a vital role in that, and we haven't talked about the 'Notebook' yet, you know, on tape.  So 'Lu's Notebook' started when?  When did 'Lu's Notebook' start?
Speaker 2: 1971.
Speaker 1: And what was it for the sake of, can you explain what it was?
Speaker 2: It was a radio commentary, sponsored by Illinois Bell Telephone Company, produced by Vince Cullers, an advertising agency here at Chicago--.
Speaker 1: A black agency.
Speaker 2: Black agency.  Illinois Bell Telephone Company came to Vince.  They needed an instrument to make them closer to the black community.  At the time that they came to Vince, telephone trucks were being raided, and they needed--they couldn't come into the black community without being jumped on.  And they had a terrible relationship.  They wanted to better that relationship.  Vince suggested the commentary, and asked me if I would do it, and I said of course.  So we, we started on four black radio stations, and for most of the time, we were on three and had almost saturation coverage of the black community, radio-wise, in Chicago.  My purpose with 'Lu's Notebook' was to provide information, provide facts of history and to give inspiration to our people and to teach them, hopefully, how to be independent and self reliant.  And everyday, I had a commentary.  And everyday it had one of those elements in it.  Well, the beautiful thing about it from my standpoint, I had control over what was being said.  The sponsor didn't know what I was going to say until I said it.  And they caught hell from the establishment, from advertisers, politicians, even black folks.  I was able to stay on the air for twelve years, mainly--.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Well--.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay go ahead.
Speaker 2: Mainly because the community backed me, and every time, Bell tried to cancel me, the community would rear up and say, no way.  Well, it finally had to come to an end.
Speaker 1: Now, wait a minute, before you get to that part, we're getting to heart of everything now.  But this is--to a lot of activity--but can you describe for us how your show came on the air.  And I want you to do two things.  Describe that and describe how many of the shows closed, the way it closed with the same phrase, I think it's your favorite phrase.  But, so can you describe, can you do the opening for us.  I know you didn't do, but somebody else did it, but--.
Speaker 2: No, it came on with, with African drums, and the announcer, talking about the talking drums and describing me as the talking drums.  And a very clever introduction which, which--.
Speaker 1: Oh, can you repeat what you just said 'cause you were moving the mic.
Speaker 2: It was a very clever introduction which welded together the African history as well as the ideology of the day, so far as I am concerned, and during, during the years that I was, I was on the air, I, I developed--whenever something particularly bad happened, when white folks did something that was just outrageous, I would always close by saying, it's enough to make a Negro turn black.  And it caught on.  People began saying, that's enough to make a Negro turn black.  And that was during the time that we were struggling to identify ourselves.  We finally became used to saying black, although we at first hesitated.  But the 'Notebook'--.
Speaker 1: Well, what--let's back up for a second.  What was the difference in your mind and in the mind, do you think of your listeners between--?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What was the difference in your mind and in the mind of your listeners between a Negro and a black person?
Speaker 2: Well, what was different is that a Negro gives in to the system and takes orders without question from white folks.  A black person resists racism and fights.  The, the, this is the activism we've been talking about.  And we have some terrible things, examples of what white folks do to black folks and when they, when they became known, I, I, I just said, this is enough to, to make a Negro--who has not yet become an activist, turn black and become one.
Speaker 1: Okay, being black requires--.
Speaker 2: Resistance.
Speaker 1: --acti-activism.
Speaker 2: And activity, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the 'Notebook', I, I can talk about Harold Washington now.  I suspect the, the greatest thing that has happened to me, for my people, was the election of Harold Washington as the first black mayor of Chicago.
Story_ID: 11574
Speaker 1: Before we--I mean in the path of that, I think you were engaged in, your [radio show 'Lu's] Notebook' engaged a, the--you had already engaged the Richard J. Daley administration, the [Michael] Bilandic administration, and you were castigating the Jane Byrne administration for some school board activities, I think.  Can you talk about that and how that, that led into the Harold Washington--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, education has always been a big problem in Chicago for black people.  We have been fighting, and my wife [Jorja English Palmer], who has been stalwart in this struggle, she can really run this down to you, but we have been fighting for proper education for black children ever since we can remember.  We, we were outraged when Jane Byrne, who was then mayor, sent word that she was going to make a white man who was the, who lived in the suburbs, president of the school board.  We were outraged.  And we called some people together at Bethel AME Church, in the parish house, and plotted a strategy to keep her from doing this.
Speaker 1: Now, let's, let's just set this up again in the sense that, what--why did you feel that there should be a black head of the school board.  I mean was the--have anything to do with the black population of the city?  What was it?
Speaker 2: Of course.  I can't remember exactly at that time, but now, the population is majority black students.
Speaker 1: In the public schools.
Speaker 2: In the public schools, and if we weren't majority then, we were very close to it.  And it just made no sense.  There had been, there had--at that point, there had been a succession of white superintendents and white board presidents, school board presidents, and things only get worse.  They don't get better.
Speaker 1: So the, the top level administration of the school board was white and the majority of the students, vast majority was black--.
Speaker 2: Of course.
Speaker 1: --in Chicago at that time.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we, we were outraged that she would think of appointing a white dude president of school board and particularly, one who didn't even live in Chicago, one who lived in the suburbs.  Well, we, we plotted our strategy.  We even went to court, had to go to court.  And again, it shows what we can do if we put our heads to it.  We, we were a ragtag bunch of folks, no money.
Speaker 1: Was this an ad hoc committee or did you have a name, or--?
Speaker 2: This was a, this was ad hoc at this time.  It was ad hoc.  What we did, we had one lawyer, and the way we paid that lawyer, we'd have rallies at Bethel Church, and take up a collection, and give it to the lawyer.  We didn't know what it would be.  He didn't know what it would be.
Speaker 1: Who was your lawyer? I don't want to stumble you, just, just keep going--.
Speaker 2: Forgotten his name.
Speaker 1: --and maybe you'll remember--.
Speaker 2: That's terrible too.
Speaker 1: Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: He's dead now.  Anyhow, he--.
Speaker 1: Grant.
Speaker 2: Grant, first name?
Speaker 1: I forget.
Speaker 2: His first--his name was Grant.  They, the city and the school board brought together all of their--they, they must have had six or eight lawyers.  And the, the force of all these six or eight lawyers couldn't subdue this one black lawyer.  And we won.  We won.  This led to the--.
Speaker 1: So, wait, you'd have to--one would have to conclude on some level, he must have had the legal higher ground because if he didn't--.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Well, one would have to conclude that he had the legal higher ground since he did not have the power that these other guys had.  So I mean he didn't represent the power structure like these other guys so he must have really had a good case.
Speaker 2: Yes, but, but we did our homework.  We proved that he did not live in Chicago.  The law says you have to live in Chicago.  They tried to say he lived in some suburb.  We proved through our lawyer that he lived in the suburb.  He did not live in Chicago.  So we had, we had the law on our side, but that doesn't mean anything in Chicago, when the establishment is concerned.  But we won.  And the result was a black school board president, the first, a minister.
Speaker 1: Smith, Kenneth Smith.
Speaker 2: Smith, was, was appointed the first black school board president of, of Chicago.  As a result of those meetings, when we won this case, and I never will forget, the ['Chicago] Tribune's' big, big headline was that we'd won, was that we had won.  I don't remember what that headline was, but huge headline cause it was a big thing.  We decided that we had better keep this group, this ad hoc group together.  And it was out of this group that CBUC was born, Chicago Black United Communities, CBUC.  I became the first president.  Harold Washington was a member of this group.  At the time, he was a congressman.  I was trying to think, he may have been--.
Speaker 1: State, state representative.
Speaker 2: --state rep.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think this is nineteen--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he became, he was a state rep.  He later became Congress.
Speaker 1: Right, in the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: But Harold, we kept this group together and formed CBUC.
Story_ID: 11575
Speaker 1: This election of Kenneth Smith as the president of the school board [of Chicago, Illinois] was in the Jane Byrne administration, right?
Speaker 2: It was under the Byrne administration.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is 1980-what? '80 [1980], '81 [1981]?
Speaker 2: It had to be '82 [1982] or three [1983].  Nah, '81, '80, probably '80.  Anyway, '80, '81.
Speaker 1: Harold Washington was a congressman in, by '80 [1980], by the election of '80 [1980], so he--well, by November of '80 [1980], I guess he was.  Go ahead.  Now, now, you achieved this victory against the combined city forces of all the city attorneys with one lawyer named Grant.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Grant was something else.  And honestly, we paid him, sometimes we might collect a thousand dollars at the rally or sometimes less than that.  Whatever we collected at these rallies, we paid him.  And it was, that's the only way we paid him.
Speaker 1: What were these rallies like, you know, for somebody who never attended one of these.  What were these rallies like?
Speaker 2: Oh man, oh they were like, they--it's hard to describe.  They, they, there were just people--emotional, and, and ready.  It's, it's a whole different climate today.  People, people were ready to move.  And they didn't make any, any bones about it, loud.  One, one--I don't, I don't remember whether it was this issue or not, but one rally we had a motorcycle gang came, came up to--.
Speaker 1: Plebiscite.
Speaker 2: Oh, that was at the plebiscite.  Ah, it was, it's hard to describe.  People were ready.  That's the only way I can say.
Speaker 1: A lot of people would pack the church.
Speaker 2: Oh, standing room only.  So the--we formed CBUC, Chicago Black United Communities, CBUC.  And among things--among other things that we were successful in doing, in retrospect, I don't know if you remember this, but it's important now.  We, we started the fight to get asbestos out of schools.  Nobody knew anything about it or why or--it's a big thing now, but back then, it was, we--people thought we were crazy.  But anyhow we, we won that fight.  We started getting schools stripped of asbestos.  And so we tried to keep CBUC on an education track, but one night at a meeting--we used to meet every Wednesday night, and they would be packed, somebody--we had on the wall a list of all the cities with black mayors.  And there were about 200 of 'em, small and large.  Somebody said, it's crazy that we have these 200 cities in the country with black mayors and we don't have a black mayor in Chicago.  Well, that started something.  Somebody else said, you know, whatever they said, I don't remember.  But they indicated that you could never have a black mayor in Chicago.  You can't beat city hall.  So we, we decided we were going to start a movement to elect a black mayor in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Now, that, that is to a large--that was, I know at that time, astonishing to a lot of people.
Speaker 2: Well, that's--black people included, 'cause black people, they used to say, oh, you're crazy, man.  You can't have no black person in--mayor in Chicago.  And then we started answering by saying, "We shall see in '83".  The election was '83.  This was '81.  So we had started two years before the election.  And it got so, again, coming back to 'Lu's Notebook', I would close out 'Lu's Notebook' with, "We shall see in '83".  And every chance I got, would make a pitch for a black mayor in Chicago.  Slowly, and I mean slowly, it caught on.  We, we didn't--we said we were going to have a, conferences at, at Malcolm X College towards a black mayor.  It was the most--one of the most successful things we've done.  Malcolm X was jammed, I mean jammed.  And we, all day, we had this conference toward a black mayor.  And we had workshops, planning sessions, committees met.  At the end of the day, as the president of CBUC, I gave the summation.  And as I stood at the microphone summing up the day's work, I started crying.  I just broke down.  I had to--Jesse Jackson stepped up, put his arms around me, and said I'll, I'll close it out.  I just couldn't--I was overwhelmed.  [Wife] Jorja [English Palmer] said, "What was wrong with you?"  I said, "Baby, I don't know.  I just, I was overwhelmed."  I said, "Something big happened today."  And--
Speaker 1: Political education.
Speaker 2: What'd she say?
Speaker 1: Yeah, she said, political education, and I know that was a big part of what CBUC did--.
Speaker 2: So then we, as, as a part of the campaign, we began political education classes because we knew we had to make the people aware of what, what this really meant.  My wife, Georgia, who was the, really the brainstorm behind most, much of this, she was the, the being of political education.  Every four weeks, we would have a political education cycle.  One, two--one class, second class, third class and the fourth class would be graduation.  And we brought in some of the best political minds in the city, taught people, really what educat--what politics was, is and how it works.  We used to have seventy-five to a hundred people per class.  By the end, by the time it was over, we had graduated over twenty--over, about twenty three hundred people.  And we had taught them how to poll watch, how to be a candidate, how to be a--how fund raise, how to, about all of the elements of politics.  And -we, we gave them, I don't know what you call it, internships.

Speaker 1: Jane Byrne, the same Jane Byrne, Mayor Jane Byrne had sent word that she was going to get Alderman [Allan] Streeter--.
Speaker 2: Now, let's tell who--Streeter was appointed by Jane Byrne, right?
Speaker 1: Streeter was appointed by the mayor, and he had--she had put these two white women over these--in place of two black men on the school board.  CBUC [Chicago Black United Communities] had protested and we--
Speaker 2: And why--can you tell us something about these two white women because I know there's more to it--?
Speaker 1: Oh, they were, they were, they were racists.  They made no bones about being racist.
Speaker 2: They were known as the Bogan broads.
Speaker 1: Bogan broads, made no bones.  They used to meet the white--black children who were bussed to white schools and throw stones at 'em and make no bones about they didn't want black, blacks in their schools.  Well, we, we tried, we protested her appointment of these two, Bogan broads.  And Alderman Streeter voted for them, and we made a--we tried to get all of the blacks to vote against them.  But Streeter voted for them.  We pitched a, you know what, with Streeter; called him, we printed leaflets and called him a traitor, and went to his meetings.  Ah, we just raised hell.  So he finally backed up and reversed his vote.  Mayor Jane Byrne said she was gonna get him.  So she had somebody running against him at the next election.  So we put all these people we had trained over in the 17th Ward to work for Streeter.  And we, we beat her candidate.  We kept Streeter in there.  We had a slogan, "Streeter beat her", talking about Jane Byrne.  Well, several racists, we put people in because we had trained them.  All of this time the, the sentiment was growing toward a black mayor.  Tom Todd, who spoke at many of our rallies, spoke at one of our rallies and said, "We are not going to have any pop-up niggers running for mayor".  That's exactly what he said.  And the people went wild.  He said, "Some Negro is gonna pop up like toast and try to run for mayor".  He said--.
Speaker 2: Just to be clear, he was, he's saying that, that a black candidate would have to represent the black community and not just pop up out of--.
Speaker 1: Precisely.  Not just any old--because that's a fact of life in Chicago.  They, they get these Negroes to run as spoils.  But Tom Todd called 'em pop-up niggers, and we were not, he said, gonna have any pop-up niggers running for mayor.

Speaker 1: So CBUC [Chicago Black United Communities] did a survey--again, [wife] Jorja [English Palmer] was the, the brainchild.  We did a survey of who should run--what black person should run for mayor [of Chicago, Illinois].  My recollection is, we had about twenty-five names--.
Speaker 2: Now, you announced this on the radio, right, I think--?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, we did all this with radio and news--everywhere, everywhere we could, we let the word out.  But we, we, we took--we, we had a survey, and then we, we had a committee to pair the survey down to the ones who got the biggest number, we brought them down to ten.  Then I called each one of them, of the ten, asked them if they won, would they run.  We didn't want to put anybody up that wouldn't run because running against [Richard M.] Daley in this town is death.
Speaker 2: Political death.
Speaker 1: Yes.  So six of them said yes.
Speaker 2: What six were they?  Can you remember?  I doubt that I can remember, Harold Washington, Jesse Jackson--.
Speaker 1: Manfred Byrd.
Speaker 2: Manfred Byrd.
Speaker 1: Was [Roland] Burris on the--.
Speaker 2: Probably Burris, I just can't remember.  We took those six, Jorja said let's have a plebiscite, black people that--most black people had never heard of that word, didn't know what it meant.  Well, a plebiscite is a vote on any issue important to a people.  So we began working on a plebiscite with these six people.  And the one who would win, we would push for mayor.  Man, when we had that plebiscite at, at Bethel [AME] Church, you couldn't go--couldn't get in the block.  I mean it was, people--that's when the motorcycle folks came.  It was about fifty motorcycles came, a motorcycle gang.
Speaker 1: It was a black motorcycle gang.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Black, yeah, scared the people to death.  They roared up there.  Everybody by this time was excited about the prospect of having a black mayor.  So we had the plebiscite.  Harold Washington, who had won the survey, won the plebiscite.  So it was clear the people wanted Harold.  The problem was, we didn't know it, but Harold wasn't excited.  He was not excited about running.  We had a meeting down in my basement--.
Speaker 1: This meeting is legendary 'cause--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --anybody who really knows this story, knows about this meeting.
Speaker 2: Boy, and we had a meeting 'cause Harold had decided he didn't want to run.
Speaker 1: Now, who was at the meeting?  Can you recall?
Speaker 2: Jorja, Conrad Worrill--.
Speaker 1: Hannibal Afrique.
Speaker 2: Hannibal Afrique, Vernon Jarrett.
Speaker 1: Renault Robinson.
Speaker 2: Renault Robinson.
Speaker 1: Danny Davis.
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: Danny Davis.
Speaker 2: What'd you say?
Speaker 1: Danny Davis.
Speaker 2: Oh, Danny Davis, yeah.  And, and we had some watermelon, never will forget.  Jorja fed us watermelon, and with watermelon we had a--Harold told us that we could not tell him what to do.  He wasn't going to run.  But you see Harold was very, very comfortable being a congressman.
Speaker 1: Because he hadn't been there long.
Speaker 2: He hadn't been there long, you're right.  But he enjoyed being a congressman.  And he decided that night that we couldn't make him run.
Speaker 1: Said we couldn't enough money.
Speaker 2: He said we couldn't raise enough money.  We couldn't get enough people registered to vote.  Well, on, on the voting, we put on a voting registration drive and, and registered the largest number of people who had ever been registered.  Harold said we needed 50,000 more registered.  We registered 150,000.
Speaker 1: Now, what--who participated in this kind of a effort?  This is something that--.
Speaker 2: Who participated in what?
Speaker 1: In this voting registration?
Speaker 2: Everybody. [Edward] Gardner at Soft Sheen, put up the money and coined the phrase--.
Speaker 1: "Come Alive".
Speaker 2: "Come Alive, October 5".  October 5 was the registration date.  Gardner put up money.  Renault was very active.  Bob Starks was very active, Conrad, everybody, sororities and fraternities and churches.  It just became a, a thing.  That's when, let's see, Taste of--no, it wasn't the Taste of Chicago.
Speaker 1: Chicago Fest.
Speaker 2: Chicago Fest, we boycotted the Chicago Fest.
Speaker 1: And that's sort of like--what is that?  What was Chicago Fest?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What was Chicago Fest?
Speaker 2: Chicago Fest, well, people know it today as Taste of Chicago where people come, sponsored by the city, and just eat. And restaurants bring food in from everywhere and just, just eat.  It's crazy.  And it was one of Mayor Jane Byrne's babies.  And we, we told people that--told black folks not, not to participate because of Jane Byrne.  We don't want her, and we--anyhow, there, there was so much going on.
Speaker 1: So was the boycott successful?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was so successful, a, a white woman came up--we had a picket line around there.  She came over to, to one of our people and said, they don't let colored people in that--there're no colored people in there.  She thought that they wouldn't let 'em in (laughter).  We just wouldn't--we, we'd stopped everybody from coming.  It became a crusade, particularly when Harold finally--we had all kinds of meetings and finally convinced Harold, you got to run.  Harold said, on November 15th he would announce whether he would run or not.  This was a special election.  He would have a press conference and at the Ramada Inn now.  It used to be the Lake Shore something--.
Speaker 1: It was the Hilton at one time.
Speaker 2: It's the Ramada Inn now.  He had it over there.  I'm not--I, I remember the date because the night before Vince Cullers, my producer, called me and said Illinois Bell Telephone Company wanted a meeting with me the next morning (laughter).  And Jorja said, "You know what that is."  I said, "No."  She said, "You are going to be fired."  Well, I went, the meeting didn't last but ten minutes.  They told me I was through, and I said why?  They said that I have become too partisan.  And I said, "You crazy.  I talk about the Democrats.  I talk about the Republicans.  I talk about the Communists, I criticize everybody."  And then finally they said, "You are pushing Harold Washington too hard."  They fired me on the spot.  And I called myself the first casualty of the election 'cause I was out of a job.  I called Jorja.  She was, was on her way to Harold--Harold's press conference was ten o'clock.  My meeting was nine o'clock.  I called Jorja and told her, and then I rushed on over to the press conference.  Harold announced that he was, he had decided to run.  And I announced to Jorja and those close to me that I was out of a job.  Well, the rest is history.  Harold won the election, the first black mayor of Chicago.  Some say today, the greatest black mayor--or the greatest mayor of Chicago.  I suppose of all my activism, that was the one thing, if I had to choose one, I would say was the greatest achievement because we showed--and I used to make speeches on this, what we, as black people can do, only if we would come together.  We came together on the Harold Washington victory.  You could not say a word against electing Harold, if you didn't want to get your face squashed in.  You just couldn't.  Everybody--and the night that he won, his victory party was over here at McCormick Inn on the outer drive, so many people were there, the people came and parked on the outer drive, just left their cars.  They couldn't find any place to park.  They just left their cars on the outer drive.  Chicago hasn't been the same since.  But, unfortunately, we are back in our days of apathy when it comes to pushing for black people.  The last election, 45 percent of black people voted for Daley, even though a black man was running, Bobby Rush.

Speaker 1: After the Harold Washington [mayoral] campaign, with the community now in this great spirit of having this, achieved this victory, something that people thought couldn't happen, what did you do after the election?  What was your--?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I just have to admit that I made a, a huge mistake.  I--you see, what I tried to tell different people close to me, I'm not a leader, and I, I, I, unfortunately, did not keep CBUC [Chicago Black United Communities] together.  Physically, I wasn't up to it, mentally, I wasn't up to it.  And I should have--if I had been a leader, I would have kept that group together.  But I, I'm not a leader, I don't want to be a leader.
Speaker 1: Sir, let me just say this--well you didn't have the radio show anymore, you know.  That might have had an effect on you.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: What do you think about--do you think that affected your--?
Speaker 2: No, not really 'cause I was, I had VON [WVON radio station], I had VON.  I, I was on the air twice a week.  I had a talk show.  But I, I just--it's kind of hard to say.  I, I don't want to be a leader, and I needed to be.  And I dropped the ball.
Speaker 1: What do you think you should have done, I mean in retrospect?  Would you do anything differently than you did?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think probably I should have called the people together, all of us who were active in the election and made some demands on, on the mayor.  That's where all of us failed.  We just let him be there.  And we didn't demand anything.
Speaker 1: What did you want or what did the group want that they didn't get?
Speaker 2: What, what I wanted, I wanted the power of city hall used to hold together the black political community.  And because Harold was the mayor, and because the community was together--that's why he became mayor, we needed him to pull us together and keep us together.  But Harold, Harold didn't want to be that kind of a leader.  Harold, if you, if you look back on Harold, he's never been an organizer.  All during his years, when he was state rep and when he was congressman, he did not have an organization because he did not know, apparently, he did not know how to organize--or he didn't want to organize, I don't know.  But that is what he should have done, and we should have made him do it.
Speaker 1: Are you saying that he didn't really feel he had a base or, I mean a--.
Speaker 2: Well, he had a base, ain't no doubt about that.  I, I may be saying he didn't know what to do with the base.  That's the only thing I can think of.  He didn't--Harold had the, the, the black community in the palm of his hands.  He could have done anything he wanted to do with the black community, black political community.  But for reasons that I don't know, he didn't do it.  And that's what I would have wanted, and I blame myself for not pulling my people together and making those demands on him.
Speaker 1: Well, were there any--was there anything accomplished during the Harold Washington administration that you really wanted to see done that you could look back and say, well, this, this--at least this happened and--?
Speaker 2: I can't think of any, anything.  There were a few more black faces in city hall.  But they were black faces.  That doesn't mean they were black in ideology.  They were black in color.  I don't know, I, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But what we must--must never forget is that by coming together, being of one mind, we did the impossible by electing a black mayor, whoever he was.  And I don't think we could have elected another black mayor without the, the, the experience and the charisma of a Harold Washington.
Speaker 1: Would you say that he was superior to Mayor Richard J. Daley or Jane Byrne or Michael Bilandic--?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely, yeah, just by virtue of being black to me makes him superior.  He's got to think along that line, even though he doesn't show it.  Yeah, I'm he's--I'm glad he was elected mayor.
Speaker 1: But did you support him in '87 [1987]?
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't, I don't even remember--I know he ran in '87 [1987], but he didn't--apparently, he didn't do much toward organizing 'cause it was, it was almost a silent campaign.
Story_ID: 11580
Speaker 1: Let me talk about some other activities.  I know you've been in some other campaigns to help people in the city.  One person was Wallace Davis--.
Speaker 2: Oh, Wallace.
Speaker 1: You want to discuss the Wallace Davis situation.  Now, this would have been in the late '70s [1970s], I guess, I mean from the mid-'70s, I guess.  The case lasted through, I guess the early '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: Well, that's really a very interesting situation.  I did not know Wallace, but I heard that he had been shot by police, and, and looking into it, I learned that he had, he had called the police to his place of business and ended up being shot and almost dead.  It almost killed him.  As a matter of fact, Wallace told me that he was given up for dead, and the only reason he's alive the nurse saw his toe twitch, and told them, "Oh, he's alive".  So I became interested and organized a committee for Wallace Davis.  And we backed him, gave him all kinds of support.  He eventually--.
Speaker 1: I know there were rallies around the city.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had rallies, marches and he eventually received a settlement from the city.  But nothing has changed.  We still have those kinds of incidents here in Chicago.
Speaker 1: So you were, you all--did you want him to settle at the time that he--?
Speaker 2: I didn't want him to settle.  I wanted to, I wanted to go to court so we could bring out all of the negatives of the police department and what, what they did to him.  But I didn't have any control over that.
Story_ID: 11581
Speaker 1: We always ask people like what do you think your legacy will be?
Speaker 2: What do I think what?
Speaker 1: Your legacy will be?
Speaker 2: Well, I hope my legacy will be my consistency.  I tried to be consistent over the years about how I feel and what is necessary for black people to do to better themselves.  That's, I hope--what I hope my legacy will be.
Speaker 1: And how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I suppose as, as the man who, who loved black people, who did all he could to help black people.  That's, that's it.
Speaker 1: Do you think your father'd [Lutrelle Palmer, Sr.] be proud of you?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, I think so, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  One last thing, I wanted to know what do you think of this project [The HistoryMakers], this history--?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think this is, I think this is fabulous.  I'm glad somebody is doing what, what we have said over and over needs to be done.  So I'm delighted to be a part of it, and delighted that it exists.
