Story_ID: 145715
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, I want to start out by asking about your family.  Now, your mother's name was Hattie Keys [ph.]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you tell us about, you know, the year--date or year of her birth and what you know about her background?
Speaker 2: My mother was born April 9th of 1921.  She was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Leo Keys [ph.] and Marie West [ph.].
Speaker 1: Do you know much about the background, you know, where they're from or, you know, how much of your family history do you know?
Speaker 2: My grandmother was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and then moved to Warren, Ohio.  And my grandfather was born in Columbus, Ohio.
Speaker 1: I see.  I see.  Okay.  And did you ever talk about growing up?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Can you share some of those stories?
Speaker 1: Yes. She was born on the north side of Pennsylvania--of the north side of--my mother was born on the north side of Pittsburgh, and she grew up on the north side of Pittsburgh and lived there until 1954 when--or in 1953, and she moved to McKeesport [Pennsylvania] with my father [Arnold Holloway]--or she moved to Braddock [Pennsylvania].  And then they--I was born in 1954, and my mother is one of eleven children, six boys and five girls, and she is the middle child.  Professionally, she was--started off--they were fairly poor.  Her father died when she was a teenager, and she had to raise brothers and sisters, and she started off as a domestic then worked waiting tables, and then sent herself to nursing school and became a nurse, and she was a practicing nurse for all of my life.  And she worked for the VA Hospital [Veterans Affairs Hospital], and then she was also a private duty nurse.
Speaker 2: So, how would you describe her?  What is your mother's personality?
Speaker 1: Well, she is a five-foot ball of energy and fire.  She's a very independent woman.  Her and my father split up when I was very young, about a year old.  And she was a dominant figure.  She was the matriarch of her family and the center of her family.  And she was very aggressive, extremely aggressive, very good with money and very independent.
Speaker 2: So how many kids in your family?
Speaker 1: I am my mother's only child, and I have an older brother and sister that are considerably older, sixteen, seventeen years older.
Speaker 2: They were products of your father?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 145716
Speaker 1: So your father, can you give his name?
Speaker 2: Arnold Decatur Holloway.
Speaker 1: And do you know much about his background?
Speaker 2: Yes. He was born in Durham, North Carolina, on a farm to Wiley Holloway and Anne, and I forget my grandmother's maiden name.  And he was one of ten children.  There were three boys and seven girls, and he also was the middle child.  He moved to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] with his father at about the age of twelve or thirteen, he and one other sister.  And then eventually the rest of the family moved to Pittsburgh.  And my father was a very talented man.  He was born on April 9th, 1917, and he studied music, played tuba, he was a very athletic person, swimmer, and, unfortunately, he dropped out of high school.  He wanted to be a doctor.  He had to drop out of high school in the twelfth grade to help take care of the family and work, and he eventually became a policeman in McKeesport, Pennsylvania, and he also worked most of his career as a security officer for Westinghouse Bettis Atomic Plant [sic, Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory].
Story_ID: 145717
Speaker 1: So did he [Arnold Holloway] stay in your life during the, you know--'cause you said that your parents split up, so was he in your life?
Speaker 2: He was in my life --
Speaker 1: The whole time?
Speaker 2: --the whole time.  As a matter of fact, before he died, I guess about fifteen years ago, he and my mother [Hattie Keys] got back together and remarried.  But they dated for most of my life.
Speaker 1: So--I shouldn't act surprised.  I have some friends, but I don't they (unclear) yet, but they broke up and then they became sort of best friends, you know.  So--that's like a little love story.
Speaker 2: It is.  They broke up.  My father got married again, and then he and my mother got back together when I was a young child, probably elementary school, and they stayed together their entire lives until he passed in 2005.
Speaker 1: But they just got back together--they got remarried.
Speaker 2: They got remarried, I believe, in 2003.
Speaker 1: (Laughs.)
Speaker 2: But they lived together for a very long time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Oh.  So do you know how your parents met?
Speaker 2: They met skating.  My father was a roller skater.  He was very athletic, and he was a big roller skater and a big swimmer.  And my mother was a skater too, a roller skater.  And they met roller skating.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That was--that's really, you don't hear so much about it, but that was a huge tradition.  And if you could roller skate, which I never could, you know, that--it was beautiful, like you were on a dance.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  'Cause they could dance, and my father could spin, he could really skate.  He was really a top skater.  He used to do roller derby and he did roller hockey, and--so he was very athletic with respect to skating.  And so, they used--we used to go skating--I think they met in Bridgeville [Pennsylvania] or somewhere like that, but maybe on the North Side, and he was older.  He was five years older.  But I believe when they met, she was in high school, and he was the love of her life (laughs.)  And she's still alive.
Speaker 1: Oh, she's still alive?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She's ninety-three.
Speaker 1: Oh, she's--wow, congratulations.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Story_ID: 145718
Speaker 1: My earliest memory growing up was, I think, moving day to the house that I grew up in, where we moved on Halloween.  And I remember being sat in a highchair, and I was a year-and-a-half old.  And I remember everything being--it was, just, you know, I guess the--all of the activity was very memorable.  And I have a lot of memories, I guess, going back to when I was three or four years old.
Speaker 2: SO like what kind of memories?
Speaker 1: Well, I remember my mother [Hattie Keys] taking me to see my father [Arnold Holloway] and pulling me on a sled and getting frostbitten (laughs).  And I was about three years old.  And then when I was three and a half or four, I was on 'Romper Room' in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], on channel 11.  And that's actually the reason that I pursued a career in television.  I was star struck by what television was up close and personal.  I was on there for a week, and I was one of the first black kids on from what my mother tells me.  And ever since then, I was struck by television.  Pretty much, that's all I ever wanted to do ever since.
Speaker 2: So did she ever explain how she got you on or what the process was like?  Did she?
Speaker 1: No, she never did.  My mother was funny.  I guess when I was two years old, I won a baby contest.  So my mother was always really searching out activities and things for me to do or, you know, exposure.  And so she would enter me in these baby contests when I was little (laughs), and I won.  I won one that I was in.  I do remember that.  And then, somehow she got me on 'Romper Room.'
Speaker 2: That would have been a big deal back then.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was. (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Story_ID: 145719
Speaker 1: Now, when you moved, what was the address you moved to?
Speaker 2: We moved from, I believe, from the North Side [of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  We lived on Bidwell Street in the Bidwell section of the North Side.  And we moved to 7014 Upland Street in Homewood.  And we moved there in 1955.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And can you describe the street that you grew up on?
Speaker 2: Then or now (laughs)?
Speaker 1: Then.  I know, not it's (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yes.  It was a street--it was a kind of a thoroughfare street through Homewood [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], which was the section of town that I lived in.  And at the time, it was full of three-story Victorian homes that were fairly large with nice front yards and backyards.  When we moved there in 1955, it was predominantly a white neighborhood, and it was one of those neighborhoods that transitioned.  By the early '60s [1960s], it was predominantly black.  It was a nice neighborhood when I grew up there.  Early in the '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s], our neighbors were predominantly white.
Speaker 1: Did you have much interaction with the neighbors?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Actually, my first friend was a little boy that lived next to me, Darryl Manke [ph.], I remember (laughs).  And then more and more black kids moved on the block.  As a matter of fact, one of my father's childhood friends lived up the street from us and he had six kids.  So we were very close.  There were a lot of kids on our block.
Speaker 1: Now, do you know the ethnic--the white kids, do you know if there were any ethnic groups, Polish--you know, the Pittsburgh area tend to have more Slavic--
Speaker 2: Yes.  These--I think they were just Protestant English background.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They weren't Eastern European.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 145720
Speaker 1: So what was the family life like?  What was it like inside your household?
Speaker 2: Family life was actually very nice.  I had a great family life.  It was an extended family, so it was my mother [Hattie Keyes], myself, early on, three of her brothers, all younger, and her mother [Marie West ph.], and then at one point, one of my cousins.  My mother's nephew, one of her sister's sons, lived with us as well.  But we had--it was a fairly large house.  It was five bedrooms.  We had a finished basement, so, and we had a big backyard.  And so that was during--that was in the '50s [1950s].  And by the early '60s [1960s], her two youngest brothers went off to the service and one went to college, Carnegie Tech [Carnegie Technical Schools, later Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] at the time, studied to be a classical and jazz musician.  And the one that went off to the service, after he came back in the mid-sixties or early sixties, then he got married and didn't move back with us for very long.  And then her other brother, who is also my godfather, he lived with us until he moved out--he lived with us until about 1970, and then he moved out two doors down the street (laughs).  But, as a result of having three uncles for a lot of my life, and one for all of my childhood, I had a lot of male role models and companionship, and we did a lot together.  One of my uncles was a big [Pittsburgh] Steeler fan, so he had season tickets to the Steelers, and I went to all the Steeler games throughout my childhood.  My other uncle, my godfather, my uncle George, he was a handyman and he worked two jobs.  And so when he wasn't working, he was working around the house and working on his cars, and he taught me a lot about taking care of a house, taking care of a property.  And then he was big into camping, and he was big into trying stuff.  So we did everything together on the weekends.  And so my time was split between him primarily and my father, who was also very aggressive in working on cars and doing things and going places.  So I had kind of the best of both worlds.
Speaker 1: You did, because that's not a typical story.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, to have that much male power around you.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You know, unless you had boys--all boys in the family.
Speaker 2: I know.  And, as a matter of fact, a lot of people would--used to think that my uncle George was my father because we spent so much time together.  And I saw my father multiple times every week and, you know, he would also work two jobs for a large part of my life.  But between the two of them, they dedicated a lot of time to me.  And it--I was--I think I really benefited from that.  And then my mother worked a lot.  She was a nurse.  But she was totally dedicated to the family.  And so, you know, she cooked and cleaned and took care of me and took care of her brothers and her mother, and probably the only difficult part of my childhood was my grandmother [Marie Keys] and my mother didn't get along (laughs).  And my grandmother did not like my father [Arnold Decatur Holloway], and she would take it out on me.
Speaker 1: Oh, she would?
Speaker 2: She would take it out on me.  And she was a very proud woman, but she was illiterate, functionally illiterate.  But no one really knew that, and I didn't even know that until I was probably almost a teenager, 'cause she was able to mask it so well, because she was a very smart woman, and--
Speaker 1: So what was her temperament then?  Why would they argue?  What was the difference in their temperament?
Speaker 2: My grandmother was very proud, and she was a very domineering person, and my mother was a very strong woman.  And so they clashed in terms of who was queen of the roost (laughs), basically.
Speaker 1: (Laughs).
Speaker 2: And my grandmother was just a very difficult person, you know.  She was born in 1894, and she had to quit school early on to take care of her younger brother and sister.  And she got married very, very early and had kids very early, and she had eleven children.  And then her husband [Leo Keys] died, and she, you know, had to really fend for herself.  And she--my grandmother never really ever worked outside the home.
Speaker 1: Do you think your mother was--how did she come to live with your mother?  Do you think she was the most responsible or one of the most responsible of--'cause she was the middle?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She was my--apparently my grandfather's favorite.  And on my grandfather's dying bed, he asked my mother to take care of her.  And she made a promise that she would and she did her entire, rest of her life.
Story_ID: 145721
Speaker 1: Now, when you think about growing up on your street at that period, what sights, smells, and sounds remind you of your childhood?
Speaker 2: Well, one sight is that it was always hazy (laughs).  Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] at that time was always gray and dusty.  And it was very cold and snowy in the winter, and very hot and humid in the summer.  And my mother [Hattie Keys] loved gardening.  And so the sights around our house were full of flowers, beautiful flowers, front and backyard.  She spent her--when she wasn't cooking, cleaning, she was gardening.  And so I just recall just beautiful flowers all over our--outside of house, and it was just a very fragrant house, and so those flowers were always brought inside.  And when she wasn't gardening, she was cooking.  My mother cooked all the time.  We never went out to eat.  Maybe, you know, on Saturdays, that was the only time when we would go for a ride.  The family, we'd all get in the car, one of our other sisters with a bunch of kids and my uncle George or my father, they, back in the sixties, everybody had big cars.  The cars held about ten people (laughs), particularly when you had kids and you didn't have seatbelts.  So the big thing, Saturday activity, was going for a ride.  And then we would go out to dinner or go to a fast-food restaurant or some kind of diner.
Speaker 1: What about sounds?
Speaker 2: Music.  My uncle, my--the middle uncle of the three, Lawrence [ph.], he was a musician, and he played the tuba, the piano, and the string bass.  And he was studying composing at Carnegie Tech[nical Schools], which is now Carnegie Mellon [University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  And he always was either listening to music or playing music.  And he played classical music and jazz.  So it was always music going on in our home.
Speaker 1: What did he end up doing?  'Cause that was pretty amazing he did that back then.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Unfortunately, he could not afford to finish, and he became an alcoholic.  But he did recover from that, and then he became an electrician.  He had to drop out his third year and work, and that crushed him.
Speaker 1: I'm sure that did, I'm telling you.  I mean, to have--to get into that school at that time and have--he had to be talented.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He was very talented.
Speaker 1: So what about smells?
Speaker 2: The smells, you know, flowers and cooking food, delicious food.
Speaker 1: Now, what about holidays then.  How were--how did you celebrate holidays and are there, you know--how did you celebrate holidays?
Speaker 2: My mother was the matriarch of the family.  Holidays were always at our home.  So Christmas, Thanksgiving, Fourth of July, Easter, Labor Day.  We would have anywhere from twenty to fifty people entering the home, eating and celebrating.  And she was--she loved to entertain the family, and she had a lot of it, so.  And most of all of her family, except two brothers, lived in Pittsburg and lived in--most of them all lived in Homewood [neighborhood in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  So they were all very close by.  As a matter of fact, her sisters and brothers on Saturday and Sunday would regularly visit.  So our home was a revolving door of family Saturday and Sunday all day.  And there were plenty of kids, cousins and aunts and uncles that were just coming and going all day long.  And so we were a very close-knit family.  Almost--you know, Pittsburgh, families are really like clans.  And so it was very, very close.  And then my grandmother [Marie Keys] lived there, so people, you know, the kids would come to see her as well.  And my father, similarly, was kind of the focal point of his family.  And has a sister that is one year older, and so holidays on that side of the family were spent at her house.  And she loved to cook and entertain.  So I would alternate going back between her house and my mother's house on, say, Christmas or Thanksgiving.  And on Christmas or Thanksgiving--or the big holidays when my mother didn't entertain, then it was always at my Aunt Hazel's house.
Story_ID: 145722
Speaker 1: And then in 1964, my mother [Hattie Keys] and uncle, George [ph.], bought a summer house in Cockerton, Pennsylvania, which is about two hours north of Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], just south of--it's a neighboring town to Media, Pennsylvania.  And so we spent our summers up there, and we would go up there on weekends all throughout the summer, because we never took any real vacations.
Speaker 2: Now, Cockerton, was it a black resort community or was it mixed?
Speaker 1: It was all white.  We were the only black people.  And actually we found out about it because my father [Arnold Holloway] had a best friend, his name was Kenny Johnson [ph.], and Kenny was half-black and half-Indian.  And he had a house in--he had a house about a half-hour north, I forget the town, but it was a summer cottage on a river called French Creek.  And so when before 1964, when we bought ours, my father and I would vacation with Kenny and his family on weekends throughout the summer.  And so my father told my mother and uncle about it 'cause--and they went up to see it and then they fell in love with it, and then they decided that they wanted to buy a house.  And where he lived, there were no black people either.  And so we kept that house until about five years ago.
Speaker 2: Oh.  That's--so you, you're really--there're two things that strike me.  One is that, even as an only child, you really have constant family around you.  It's--right?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And then the second is the purchase of that--you know, the summer home, too, you know, at that time.
Speaker 1: Oh, it was aggressive step for a black family, in Pittsburgh in particular, to have a summer home.  And it was funny, until the house was not winterized, so it was just really a summer resident.  And then I guess 1976 my uncle and mother decided that they--it didn't have a basement.  It had a third cellar.  They decided they wanted to have a basement put in.  So they contracted with the local contractor to have a basement installed.  And on the last day of the excavation, there was a high-lift under the house, the house was up on stilts, and the high-lifts struck the center beam of the house and the house fell in the hole.  And so the contractor agreed to build a new house for what he was going to spend on being paid to put in the basement.  So he put up the shell of a house, and one of my mother's brother-in-laws was a draftsman for Westinghouse, and he designed a small, three-bedroom house, and the contractor built the house, but he only finished it 75 percent and then he skipped town.  So for the next year, my family and I built--finished that house.  We did all the work ourselves, and it was a nice little house.
Speaker 2: So this is your--so every summer you would go there?
Speaker 1: Yes.  We'd spend every weekend in the summer, unless there was something--some sports or something else that I was involved in.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Oh.
Speaker 1: And it was right off of the French Creek.  So we had a boat.  We would go boating, and we swam, we fished.
Speaker 2: So who had the boat?  Your uncle?
Speaker 1: My uncle.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Your uncle.
Speaker 1: My Uncle George had a boat.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Story_ID: 145723
Speaker 1: Now, what schools do you attend?
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: Elementary--
Speaker 2: Elementary school, from kindergarten to fourth grade was Belmar Elementary School [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], which was in Homewood [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] around the corner from my house.  And in 1964, I was bused at the age of ten, which was the first year of school busing nationally.  And I was bused to Sterrett Elementary School.  And I went from the fifth grade to the eighth grade at Sterrett.  And that school was in Point Breeze [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: And then, did high school go from ninth to twelfth?
Speaker 2: High school went from ninth to twelfth, and the high school I went to was Taylor Allerdice [High School] which was in Squirrel Hill section, which is a very ritzy, exclusive section of Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].
Story_ID: 145724
Speaker 1: My mother [Hattie Keyes] did a whole thing on my grandmother [Marie Keys], and because she didn't have any birth records, she didn't have any records, social security card or anything.  And so to get Medicaid and Medicare when that came out, my mother had to do research on how old--when exactly she was born and where she was born and that sort of thing, and they found the birth records, and she was born on Susquihanna Street in Pitts--in Homewood [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And she--my--her grandmother was a slave, and apparently she was either married to her master or her master freed her or something and had my grandmother's mother.
Speaker 2: And had?
Speaker 1: My grandmother's mother.
Speaker 2: I see.  You mean, because she was freed or because there was intermixing?
Speaker 1: It was intermixing.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I was going to say.  Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Yeah--
Speaker 1: My grandmother's mother was the product of a slave and a white man.
Story_ID: 145725
Speaker 1: I went to Belmar Elementary [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: In that--
Speaker 1: In Homewood [neighborhood in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, is that walking distance from you?
Speaker 1: Yes.  It was just four blocks away.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, can--tell me how you were as a little boy.
Speaker 1: As far as what?
Speaker 2: What--your demeanor.  Were you quiet?  Were you--because only children--but you sort of got a lot of people around you, but only children sometimes live, you know, in their head or they have--sometimes they even have imaginary character--you know, friends, and--
Speaker 1: No.  I didn't have any imaginary characters.  Well, at that time, I guess when I was about seven or eight, my cousin, who is nine years older than one, came to live with us.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so he was, I believe, he was in high school.  And so we were very close, and it was like having a big brother who--
Speaker 2: You have all these big brothers.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Wow.  Okay.
Speaker 1: And I was a fairly quiet kid.  I was very, you know--or, initially, I was fairly studious, but kind of got away from that.  I--by the time I got into elementary school at Belmar, Homewood had turned into an all-black--predominantly black neighborhood, and it was a fair--it was a tough neighborhood.  It was becoming a tough neighborhood.  And so, being an only child in the elementary school where most everybody had siblings, I got into a lot of fights.
Speaker 2: You know, it's interesting how quickly that changed.
Speaker 1: It changed in about six years.
Speaker 2: You know, 'cause you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Less than ten years.
Speaker 2: --and now, I mean, when you tell me that it was--that was white flight, and it's, I mean--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: You know.  So you got in fights?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I had to fight a lot.
Speaker 2: You did?  Okay.  So starting in what grade?
Speaker 1: First grade.
Speaker 2: First grade?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: 'Cause often you would be tested, right, coming home from school?  Or did you start the fight?
Speaker 1: No.  I generally was the victim.
Speaker 2: So what is your cousin, your uncles, what are they telling you?
Speaker 1: To fight (laughs).  Actually (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: You don't want to be a sissy (laughs).
Speaker 1: Right.  They--actually, my uncle put me in judo--in karate class, and I took that for several years.  And my mother [Hattie Keys ph.] was determined, and my father [Arnold Decatur Holloway] just said, "You got to fight."  And so I was kind of a small kid.  I was, you know, a little--about as average to small.  So, as a result, I was, you know, I was bullied a lot, and I had a temper.  I was quiet, but I had a very bad temper.
Speaker 2: Now, how did your temper, how did it display then?
Speaker 1: I would fight back (laughs).  I refused to allow myself to be bullied.  And so that's why I said, I got in a lot of fights.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So if someone would come, they would be picking on you, you'd be like, wait a minute (unclear).
Speaker 1: I didn't--yes.  I'd fight.
Speaker 2: And in first grade, I couldn't see really, because they, you know, they didn't test your eyes back in those days.  So in first grade, I was in--in my elementary school, they had levels in each grade.  They had a high level, a medium level, a low level, and then disturbed kids or problem kids.  And actually the lower two levels were most of the either kids who had, you know, low-functioning intelligence compared to the others, or they were behavioral problems.  And so in the first grade, I suffered in--I suffered from a lot of headaches, and I didn't sit in the front of the room.  And I was, I guess, testing going into--testing from kindergarten to first grade--I was tested high, and so they put me in the smart class.  And then when I didn't learn, because I couldn't see the blackboard, by the time they discovered that I needed classes in first grade, it was so far along in the year, and I was not doing well.  And then in second grade, they put me in the third level down.  And in that level of--in second grade, I was with a lot of problem kids, and then I was smart, a lot smarter than most of them.  And so I got bullied a lot, and then that's when the fighting really began, and very heavy from--and then I had to--second and third grade, I had to climb back up.  And third grade they put me in the second highest, and then in fourth grade, I got back to the highest level.   But in the process, I had--there was a lot of bullying and a lot of fighting, lot of fist fighting.
Speaker 1: Now, when you say a lot, how often, like--'cause when you're saying a lot, it sounds like not every day, but--
Speaker 2: Almost every day.  Almost every day.
Speaker 1: So there's not a lot of--your activity is more outside the school.  What about inside the school?
Speaker 2: It's--inside the school, well, in those days--
Speaker 1: You weren't--you said you weren't the best student back then, right?
Speaker 2: Well, no, because I initially couldn't see.  And so--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --when they put me in the lower levels, you know, there wasn't as much teaching going on because it was a lot of discipline problems with the kids.  And so, you know, I just learned--I became slack myself.  And it took, you know, a couple of years to get back on track.
Story_ID: 145726
Speaker 1: What do you think your mother's [Hattie Keys] thinking during this period of time?  Is she aware or is she just really--
Speaker 2: No.  She's aware, because there was so much fighting going on, you know.  Kids would steal my books and I'd come home missing things, and, you know.  She could see that I had been fighting.  And she knew that I also, you know, there were some problem kids that lived on our block, and so, you know, she knew that I was fighting a lot.  And she talked to a couple of the parents, but, you know, it didn't matter.  And she realized that she needed to get me out of the school, out of that school, that it was a problem.  And so she signed me up for busing.
Speaker 1: So that's when you got bused to the-and she did that to get you out of the community.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And this is new, integration, you know, this is after Brown versus Board of Education [1954], but it's not that far.
Speaker 2: It's the first year of the execution of Brown versus Board of Education.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: It's 1964.
Speaker 1: I see.  Okay.  Because this is pre-busing of the, you know, the '70s [1970s], really.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So how would (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: So, she didn't, you know, no one knew what to expect, really.  And so, she didn't have any real knowledge other than I was going to be shipped off to a better school in a white neighborhood.  And so, there was a whole group of kids from Homewood [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] that were bused to Sterrett [Classical Academy, Point Breeze, Pennsylvania] and to other schools, Linden [Elementary School, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], Greenfield [Elementary School, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  Those were predominant schools from my side of town that the kids were bused to.  And Sterrett was in a predominantly Jewish neighborhood of Point Breeze [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] at that time.  And the school was fine.  We didn't have any problems with the kids.  The only problems we had were with the administrators, the principal and some of the teachers.
Speaker 1: And in what way?
Speaker 2: Well, it was like a two or three strike rule on discipline.  You were thrown out.  You were graded on a different set of criteria, particularly on anything that was subjective.  They played favorites.  We didn't get to do things like clean the erasers or wash the blackboard.  And then at lunchtime, since it was a school that was set up for kids to be bused in, we had no cafeteria.  So ate lunch--they'd put tables in a room in the basement near the boiler room, just a big open space, and you had the long tables with stools.  And we'd eat--had to bring our lunch.  And that's where we ate lunch.  But we weren't able to interact with the regular kids, the white kids, who lived in that community during lunchtime.  We all had to stay together by ourselves.  And we were watched by an older woman, who was hired by the school to come and just nursemaid us.  And we weren't allowed to leave a certain area.  We could go outside, but we weren't allowed to leave a certain--the basketball court.  And we weren't allowed to play with balls or run.  So we made up our own games.  And we used to collect--have all the kids bring sandwiches in aluminum foil.  And then we would make balls out of the aluminum foil and we would play slow motion games.  We'd play slow motion basketball with a ball made out of aluminum foil.  We played slow motion football made out of aluminum foil, because we weren't allowed to run (pause) or--
Speaker 1: This is totally a description of they had no plan.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And they were forced to do it.  I haven't heard that.  So they just had you there sort of.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, who was teaching you though?
Speaker 2: The regular teachers.
Speaker 1: The regular teachers.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: So they just--
Speaker 2: We were fully integrated into the classrooms.
Speaker 1: But you said that they had you--
Speaker 2: Oh, only during lunchtime.
Speaker 1: Oh.  Only--oh.  So during lunchtime.
Speaker 2: We were segregated.
Speaker 1: They segregated you. That's--okay.
Story_ID: 145727
Speaker 1: What else is forming you, Doug, in those early years?  Or did--you know, and these--you know, when you're in your, you know, the boys become sort of teenage, what is forming you, sort of as a--
Speaker 2: Well, the Civil Rights Movement is in full swing.
Speaker 1: And are you aware?
Speaker 2: Oh, very much so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And why is that?  A lot of discussion in the household?
Speaker 2: Lot of discussion in the household.  My uncle Lawrence [ph.] was very politically active.  He, by now, he had pretty much cleaned up and he was an electrician, and he was protesting, trying to get jobs for union workers in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  And there was--you would--there was just a--Pittsburgh was going through a lot of change at that time, and Pittsburgh, as you know, was a very segregated city by then, and a lot of Eastern Europeans, Italians, Irish, and there were a lot of clashes.  And so I was being formed by all that was going on in Pittsburgh at that time, growing up in what had become a really tough neighborhood, Homewood, and just being a man, you know, kid about Pittsburgh, plus starting in 1961, at the age of seven, you know, my family was much into the European or I'd say East European work ethic.  They had grown up in the North Side, and my father [Arnold Holloway] grew up in Braddock [Pennsylvania], and so they were pretty much workaholics, so everybody had to kind of pull their own weight.  And when I was seven, I was old enough to get a paper route.  So I had some friends that were two years older.  And so they decided that they wanted money, and so, nobody--the kids in the neighborhood were all middle income, lower or middle income.  And so we all went and signed up to get [Pittsburgh] Courier routes.  And so starting at age seven, I went around the neighborhood and I got thirty-six people to sign up to be my Courier route, and also Jet magazine.  And so I--I sold Couriers and Jet magazine once a week, and I did it until I was twelve years old.  And so I was kind of--I had a fair amount of independence, it was at seven and eight years old, walking around Pittsburgh, particularly in the wintertime.  And around Homewood at night, 'cause I to deliver the papers after school and homework and, you know, it was dark.  So I had to really get tough, as a tough kid so that the other kids wouldn't my money, and 'cause by--my route was pretty--it was pretty--pretty--it was a pretty long route in terms of how far I had to walk.  It was several miles that I had to walk carrying papers.  And when I was seven, eight, nine years old, I used to have to make two trips home to get the papers, because I couldn't carry them all in a bag in one shot (laughs).
Speaker 1: 'Cause that was your money there, right, your papers?
Speaker 2: That was my money.
Speaker 1: Your papers and your money.
Speaker 2: Right.  That was my money.
Story_ID: 145728
Speaker 1: What you're really describing is sort of life, you know, where there's a lot of fighting going on.  You know, maybe the area is changing, a lot of people coming in.  You know, there's a lot of--but I think people would have been--wouldn't they--they would be moving to Homewood [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] to move up?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right?  Yes.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, you know, the play 'Fences' [by August Wilson, 1983] it takes place in Homewood.  And 'Fences' is really based on a true story.  And it's based on the garbage man who is my garbage man.  His name was Vasser.  And his son was the star football player for Westinghouse [High School, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], and his name was Dorian Vasser.  As a matter of fact, he was one of--my older cousin was his best friend.  And the difference between the true story and the story in 'Fences' is that, Dorian got shot.  I believe he was a sophomore or junior in high school.  He shot and killed on my block, at the corner of my block.
Speaker 1: So you knew those actual people?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I didn't--yes.  Vasser was our garbage man.  He was our garbage man.
Speaker 1: See, you know--I'm telling you.  August Wilson was amazing when it came to Pittsburgh history.
Speaker 2: He was.
Speaker 1: (unclear).  So your--what about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: There were other characters in his plays that I knew as well.
Speaker 1: Like who?
Speaker 2: Well, there's a reference to a number runner.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: And--from the Hill District, and I believe, by all accounts, that it was my uncle, who was my brother--my father's [Arnold Holloway] brother-in-law.  And he was married to one of the major beauticians in the Hill, up on Crawford and Wiley [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  And then, West [ph.], the funeral director, is a relative by marriage, my cousin.  One of my older cousins married the West's daughter, one of the daughters.  So I knew, you know--and he's a lot older, this cousin, Theodore Butler, and he was, I guess he's twenty years older than I.  No, he's about fifteen, sixteen years older than I am.  And so we were very close.  As a matter of fact, one of the reasons I was able to defend myself is that he was, in the service, a Golden Glove Boxer, and he taught me how to box when I was a very young kid.  So, you know, though I fought a lot, I was able to defend myself well because I did know how to fight, both martial arts and actual boxing.
Story_ID: 145729
Speaker 1: So what would hear about the numbers runners?  Were your--was anyone in your household placed--you know, dreaming numbers?  I remember growing up people were dreaming the numbers, and--
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --you know, they'd put the money, and you would hear whether they, you know, would they win or not.  Did that happen in your household?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Well, my father [Arnold Holloway] played numbers every day of his life (laughs).  And my mother's [Hattie Keys] sister was actually a numbers drop-off point.  And she was--so people, you know, brought the numbers to her, and then she, you know, had somebody that she, you know, took the numbers to, and the money.  And so the numbers were very big in our family.
Story_ID: 145730
Speaker 1: What other things do you think of when you think of that neighborhood?  Were there--were you religious at all?  Was your family religious and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, what denomination?
Speaker 2: Well, I was baptized Presbyterian.  And for a long--I guess until probably I was about eight or nine--seven or eight years old, we commuted to the North Side to Bidwell Presbyterian Church.  That's where my mother [Hattie Keys] and grandmother [Marie West] went, and they were raised in that church.  And then, I'd say, probably around seven or eight, nine years old, I joined with my cousins, Homewood AME Zion Methodist Church on Homewood Avenue [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  And so, one of my good friends--or actually, two of my good friends that I grew up with, we would walk to church every Sunday to go to Sunday school and then stay for church.  So my mother, by--didn't go to church that much 'cause she worked so much, and it was difficult to get to church on Sunday.  But I was required to go to church, and I went to church up until high school.
Story_ID: 145731
Speaker 1: What other things do you think were influential in your growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, I was very big into sports.  I played little league baseball.  I ran track, both in elementary school and in high school.  I played some football, first year in high school, and played a lot of street football.  And I was very independent.  I was with a group of guys, we rode our bikes and we explored--we would just go exploring walking.  We would walk for hours just to explore other neighborhoods, not knowing--we would just tear off and start walking in a direction and then explore.
Speaker 1: So who were your friends growing up like then?
Speaker 2: They were of--a lot guys from the neighborhood, from my block.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then, I guess when I was ten years old, my older cousin, who'd also taught me to box, he was in college at Point Park College [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], and some of his friends from college took him skiing, and he fell in love with it.  And came back on one of his weekend visits to our house, 'cause he was very close to my mother [Hattie Keyes ph.] 'cause his mother and my mother were very close, so he would come by a lot, and he told me about skiing and asked me if I wanted to go.  And so he took me skiing, I fell in love with skiing, and then we started skiing all the time.  We started skiing several days a week.  And I used money from my paper route.  And then I start--later started to be a janitor for my uncle, who worked at a janitorial company, my uncle George, and he was the supervisor, and so I used to janitor with him on the weekends.  And then I earned enough money to be able to buy my own ski equipment and then go skiing.  So I got to be a very good skier.  I'm still a very good skier.
Speaker 1: Wow. (Simultaneous)
Story_ID: 145732
Speaker 1: How does junior high change from elementary?  Is there any change for you?
Speaker 2: Well, yes (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: You were--
Speaker 2: It was a big change from elementary to junior high.  One, because I was going to school in a white neighborhood [Sterrett Classical Academy, Point Breeze, Pennsylvania], and, you know, the curriculum was fairly rigorous compared with the curriculum was at the black elementary school.  And then I had to come home to an all-black community where, you know, there was concern that, well, maybe you're better than us.  And then in 1968, I was in the seventh or eighth grade, and that's when the riots went off in Pittsburgh.  And so, my neighborhood, Homewood [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], burned.  I was out in the streets, as a matter of fact, during the riots, witnessing, not participating, but certainly witnessing a lot of stores being burned, a lot of vandalism, shootings.  And then the National Guard moved into Homewood, as it did the Hill [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] and other sections.  So we had to get police escorts, because we caught the public bus, the 74-A, which we called the maid express, because in the mornings when we got on the bus, it was just kids and maids going into Pointe Breeze in Squirrel Hill [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  And so, you know, it was a difficult time because the white kids at school seeing on television what was happening, and then Homewood and how it had burned, and the National Guard being there and, you know, it was--it became an interesting time.  But I did get some--I had a couple of--developed some good friendships with some of the kids.
Speaker 1: With some of the white kids?
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Some of which I'm still friends with today.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 145733
Speaker 1: I wanna ask you, you know, because there's sort of strong work ethic there.  Now, none of your family--what I don't hear, I don't hear the mills.  I hear janitor.  I hear whatever--I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: My father [Arnold Holloway] was in security.
Speaker 1: Yeah, secur--were there--'cause the mills--a lot of people worked in the mills.
Speaker 2: Right.  But only two members of my family that I know of worked in the mills.
Speaker 1: I mean, that's just interesting, because that was the main employer, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and that was why the sky was always, you know, gray.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: In fact, it's--I went back there, and I couldn't believe how pretty Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] is.
Speaker 2: Yes.  It's really (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 1: I looks like (laughs) (unclear)--I said, "It looks like Switzerland (laughs)," 'cause I hated--there were, you know, the homes were on stilts and, you know, that may be outside of Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], 'cause--.  So you--you know what I also found interesting in preparing for your interview, that the things your parents taught you or your, you know, your family members taught you, like, your--I heard that your father said, you know, your word is your bond.  You have to stand up and believe--well, this is what you, you know, I had you put--really, stand up for what you believe and be a righteous person.  I mean, these--you were--things were being set in motion back then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --to who, you know, you would be today.  So now in the--so what are you hearing discussed in your family about, you know, what's happening both in Pittsburgh and around the country and, you know, what are people--what are people talking about?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, my family--my uncle Lawrence [ph.] was fairly radical.  He was out there in the streets protesting, and he was very educated, having gone to Carnegie Tech [Carnegie Technical Schools, later Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  And so, he was very politically motivated.  He was kind of torn between violence and non-violence or civil disobedience.  My uncle George was pretty much a pacifist.  He just felt that working hard would do it.  My father [Arnold Holloway] was--he was pretty much a stand-up guy, he didn't really take one side or another, 'cause he had grown up in Braddock [Pennsylvania] when it was all white, and--so he didn't take one position or another.  He was concerned about all the violence that was going on and was against it.  But he wasn't really one to get involved so much.  He was kind of a loner.  I mean, he had some good friends, but he was a bit of a loner.  And my mother [Hattie Keys] was much the same.  And so there was a lot of debate in the family about what was right and what was wrong and whose tactics were correct or not.  And the Black Muslims were fairly big in Pittsburgh and in Homewood [Pittsburg, Pennsylvania].  And kind of in our family, there was a joke about Brother would come to the door every Saturday, you know, with Muhammad Speaks.  And out of deference, you know, they would buy the paper.  So, you know, between myself selling the Pittsburgh Courier and Jet magazine, I did a lot of reading of what was going on.  And then it was always a Muhammad Speaks in our house.  You know, they would just, you know, help--to help out, you know.  They didn't know much about the Black Muslims, but, you know, they would be intrigued by some of the, I guess, stories that were there.  So we always had one of those in the house.
Story_ID: 147206
Speaker 1: So you were talking about the Pittsburgh Courier, the Muhammad Speaks, these are where you're becoming aware of what's going on, sort of, around.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And that and the news.  My family were news junkies.  Everybody, you know, religiously we watched the news.
Speaker 1: Now, what about boxing; was there watch--was there interest in boxing?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Well, particularly because my cousin was a boxer.  So--and he, you know, was in love with Muhammad Ali or Cassius Clay originally.  And so I was very aware of Cassius, who then became Muhammad.  So we--there was a lot of discussion in our family about that.
Speaker 1: And then so, when you go--so the school that you, the junior high school, how many blacks are in that school?
Speaker 2: Throughout all the grades, maybe thirty.
Speaker 1: I see.  So what is the relationship between black boys and white girls?  In that school?  In junior high?
Speaker 2: It was a good relationship.  There were white girls that liked us.
Speaker 1: But that would always happen.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughs).
Speaker 2: And you know, we had a cloakroom.  We didn't have lockers in junior high school.  We had a cloakroom that was behind the blackboard.  So the normal things went on in the cloakroom (laughs).
Speaker 1: Okay (laughs).  So it was where you would hang your coats and things like that.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  And then, now, what subjects--what are you interested in at that point?  I know you're interested in the sports, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  As far as my interests, they were pretty broad, you know.  I was really-I wanted to be an entertainer to a degree.  I wanted to be on television, so my mother [Hattie Keys] signed me up for tap dance lessons.  I wanted to be like a Sammy Davis, Jr.  So I took piano lessons in first grade.  I didn't like piano.  I then took up the drums.  And I had--my uncle in Denver [Colorado], Leo [ph.], he was a drummer.  He was a jazz drummer.  And so I wanted to be a drummer.  And so I played the drums.  And then I took acting lessons at the Pittsburgh Playhouse.  And so I took dance and acting.  And those were my interests.  And I thought that I could combine them with a career either on television or in television in some way.
Speaker 1: So then who are you--who were you admiring then?  Who did you want to be like?
Speaker 2: Well, from an entertainment standpoint, I wanted to be like Sammy Davis Jr.
Speaker 1: Junior.  Okay.
Speaker 2: But I wasn't--I didn't like his personality too much and nor his slick hair, because I had an Afro.  But in terms of his talent, 'cause I also sang; I sang in the church choir, and I was a soloist.  And I also sang in the school choir.
Speaker 1: So were you an alto?
Speaker 2: I was soprano.
Speaker 1: Soprano?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Then I became an alto.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: But I was--I sang a lot.
Speaker 1: A lot?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you ever have a part of a singing group of any sort?
Speaker 2: No.  But I had a jazz quartet.
Speaker 1: Oh, you did?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.  We called them (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 1: You never--
Speaker 2: --a combo.
Speaker 1: A combo.  Was that in high school?
Speaker 2: Junior high school.
Speaker 1: That's in junior high?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Wow.  Okay.  So were you performing around or performing at school?
Speaker 2: No.  We just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Just practicing?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I did--I played drums in the school orchestra.
Speaker 1: Well, now, what instrument did you play in the jazz combo?
Speaker 2: Drums.
Speaker 1: Drums?  Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  As a matter of fact, two of the guys went on to be professional musicians.
Speaker 1: Wow.  Okay.
Story_ID: 147207
Speaker 1: Now--now, when you go to high school, where is that?  Because that's across town too, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It's in Squirrel Hill [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: And squirrel--Explain what Squirrel Hill is for people who don't know.
Speaker 2: Squirrel Hill is a predominantly Jewish, very upper middleclass to highly affluent neighborhood.  And it borders Point Breeze [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], which is a middleclass neighborhood and Greenfield [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], which is an ethnically--ethnic neighborhood of Eastern Europeans, Italians and Irish.  And it's not far from Homestead, which were in Hazelwood, which were the hubs of the steel mills.  As a matter of fact, a lot of executives from the mills or other associated industries lived in Squirrel Hill in large Victorian and Tudor homes.
Speaker 1: And so when--how do you come to go to--is it--it's--
Speaker 2: Taylor Allerdice High School [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Taylor Allerdice.  How do you have (unclear)?
Speaker 2: What--Sterrett was a feeder school to Taylor Allerdice.  It was one of four or five feeder schools to Taylor Allerdice.  And Taylor Allerdice started in the seventh grade and went to twelfth.  But, because I was in elementary school, they had a middle school, I went in ninth grade.  And I got to Taylor Allerdice in 1968.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, oh, 1968, all kinds of things are happening.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So you've got your radical uncle, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Didn't you say your uncle was a radical and he's--and then you have--you know, there's a lot of things about Vietnam--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and the draft that's sort of going on.  Those things are around you, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And you have the hippie movement.  And you have the, you know, just all sorts of things, you know; politically and economically going on.  And so when we get to Allerdice, everything about busing changes, because the kids that come from Greenfield [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] and Homestead and Hazelwood that are of Eastern European, Irish and Italian descent, they are middle and lower middleclass whites and even poorer.  And so, they resent the fact that black kids are in school with them.  And so what's happening around the country in terms of racial issues get carried out in high school.  And so there's constant fighting, there are riots, there's a lot of problems.  We almost didn't graduate because of--the white kids pulled the fire alarm, and I think called in a bomb scare during our finals, so that when we came out they jumped us.  But we had--we--our school would--generally would be shut down two or three times a year because of fights and riots.  And we'd have to call in--they'd call in the police and we would have to get escorted out of the neighborhood on school buses, because we took--we didn't come in on school buses.  We came in on city buses.  But they would have to escort us home because they would stone us, stone our buses.  And so, you never really would walk around the school by yourself.  You always had to be with someone, because if you were by yourself you would get jumped, which many kids and get beat up really badly.  And so, you know, we--there were two high school--there were many high school football rivalries.  Allerdice had a big rivalry with Westinghouse High School [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  And Westinghouse High School was in Homewood [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], and mostly all the black kids came from Homewood.  And so, and it got to the point where they wouldn't even allow kids from the other schools to attend the away games because of the fights and the rioting that would take place.  They'd ask--some of the games even got stopped because it was so bad.
Speaker 1: So did the population of Squirrel Hill change?
Speaker 2: No.  The population (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Or are you both--so both--or who--both whites and blacks, are they being bused into--I'm just trying to--
Speaker 2: Right.  They're being both (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --bused into (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, to the school.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: I see.  So what was the ratio?  Was it more whites than blacks or more blacks--or even?
Speaker 2: More whites than blacks.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They--the whites that were coming in from the other neighborhoods outside of Squirrel Hill were coming in from feeder schools.  Just like Sterrett was a feeder school.  Greenfield Elementary School [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] was a feeder school, and Hazelwood and Homestead elementaries were feeder schools into Allerdice.  So once everybody got into high school, then all hell broke loose.
Story_ID: 147208
Speaker 1: So what about the teachers [at Taylor Allerdice High School, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]?  So what was the racial makeup of the teachers?
Speaker 2: I believe we only had about three or four black teachers.  But we did, after freshman year and sophomore year, we got a black principal.  And he cracked down on everything.  They brought in armed guards into the high school.  And so things at times would get better.  He would also chase kids, you know, out of the--you know, if you were in the hall during class or outside.  He was known to roam the halls and the perimeters and chase you down or, you know, he'd started finding out who you were and, you know, he'd go get you in class, pull you out, and then they start, you know--the detention and suspension ratio went way up.  But it didn't--I mean, it stopped some of the fighting, but it didn't stop some of the rioting when it--when--'cause someone would get beat up or attacked and then there would be retaliation, and it would be a big to do.
Speaker 1: Did you--if I'm hearing this, there was a lot of fighting going on.  I mean, from elementary to high school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean, first--but the first part was just the change in community and you being maybe small, you know, just this--this--but then--I mean, you know, you hear about the other places, but I didn't think that was, you know, it was--I don't know if I didn't understand that going on in Pittsburgh like that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was pretty--it was an intense place.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: But, it--it really didn't bother me much.  You know, it was just something--but the problem I had, I guess in high school, was kids resenting me because I was going to a white high school.  So I had that to contend with.
Speaker 1: You mean in your community?
Speaker 2: In my community.
Speaker 1: Now, why was that--were they going to Homewood [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: They were going to Westinghouse [High School, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: They were going to Westinghouse.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And so, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay.  But, no--but how did you end up going there?  I mean what was the division?  Who was--who from your neighborhood was going to Westinghouse , and who was going to Taylor Allerdice?
Speaker 2: It was really if you were bused.  If you were in--if you had been put into the busing program, then you went to Allerdice; otherwise, you went to Westinghouse.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Or if you got kicked out of the busing program, then you went to Westinghouse.
Speaker 1: Westinghouse, right.
Story_ID: 147209
Speaker 1: So then people, are they calling you--I mean, do they make any references, like, you know, your--about being around white people?  I mean, is there anything like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Some of that, you know.  But I always had friends.  I always was around friends.  In school or at home, I didn't really, in high school, go out really by myself much, out.
Speaker 1: You would always go with friends.
Speaker 2: I would always go with friends.  As a matter of fact, I'm still friends with some of those same guys.  One of those guys, as a matter o fact, saved my life one day.
Speaker 1: How?
Speaker 2: Well, we were drinking wine (laughs) in the alley, and there was a guy that resented the fact--resented--just resented me, didn't like me.  And he had a gun.  And he was going to take me out.
Speaker 1: And what did your friend do to prevent (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: He talked him out of it.
Speaker 1: He talked him out of it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What did he say?  "Man, you don't want to do that?"
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  And he had the gun in my face, and he talked him out of it.
Speaker 1: Have you guys--had that particular guy and you had encounters before?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Was he drunk?
Speaker 2: He had been drinking, then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Wow.  Okay.
Story_ID: 147210
Speaker 1: So is there talk of ways of you going to college?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It was--in my household, there was never any other expectation that I would not go to college.  My mother [Hattie Keys], when I was in high school, was actually in college herself getting her (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Getting her nursing.
Speaker 2: She was getting her nursing degree.  She was already a nurse.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But she was getting a degree in nursing.
Speaker 1: And--see, and you know--and that's what I think.  You know, a lot of people, they kept striving, you know.  They wanted to improve and make things better.  So do you end up going to Northeastern University [Boston, Massachusetts]?  Why that choice?  Had you heard about it?  Who was from (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Nobody.  I didn't want to go--I didn't want to stay in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], and I didn't want to really go to the Midwest.  I wanted to go to a big city, and I wanted to go to a college town.  And I got recruited by the University of Dayton [Dayton, Ohio], Bradley University [Peoria, Illinois], Northeastern, and Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts]; and a couple of other schools locally.  But the schools outside of the city, those were the main schools I got recruited by.  And I applied to Northeastern, and I ended up getting a full scholarship, [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] five-year scholarship.  And I really wanted to go to Boston University, because Boston University had a communications program, and that was my first choice, but I only got a partial scholarship, and I couldn't afford to go to Boston University at the time.  So even though I had never been to Boston or Northeastern or any other place to look at colleges, it was probably--it was just a (unclear) that I go to Northeastern.  And so, since they didn't have a television program or communications program, they had journalism.  So I decided to study journalism.  And I did that for two years.
Speaker 1: And then you moved over to Emerson [College, Boston, Massachusetts], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.  To Emerson.
Speaker 2: You know, the program at Northeastern was a co-op program.  It was a quarterly program.  It was five years.  And 1972 was--Boston was gearing up for busing, and I was a freshman there.  And my--I almost flunked out my first year 'cause I wasn't a good student.  And I--my geography teacher lost my final, and so I failed geography.  And I convinced my mother that I didn't--not take the test.  And she contacted the school and they reinstated me, and they let me take the final over. And then I regained my scholarship.  And then the next year as a sophomore, I had to go on co-op the second quarter, and it was the beginning of the winter season.  And I--they didn't have any--I couldn't get a job.  I couldn't find a job for a co-op in journalism.  So I ended up going to work for the federal records department in South Boston [Massachusetts], in the South Boston Neighborhood Yards.  And basically all I was doing was filing records.  And the guy who ran the facility was from South Boston.  And I had a big Afro and I was fairly militant by then.  And we did not get along.  And I had bought a car over the summer, and so I was driving, and I guess, one day in January, at the beginning of January, I got hit.  A bus ran a red light and totaled my car.  And so the next week, the manager facility sent me to Waltham-Mass [Waltham, Massachusetts].  He transferred me to Waltham-Mass, because he knew I didn't have transportation.  And the facility on Waltham-Mass was beyond the bus line.  And so I had--and I lived--at the time I lived in Forest Hills [Boston, Massachusetts].  And so I had to go, take three trains and then walk a mile and a half.  And that was one of the worst winters ever in Boston.  It was snow and cold.  And I'll never forget, I went to the [U.S.] Army/Navy store, and I bought a World War Two, long winter coat, because that was the only thing that would really me warm on that walk, because I had to walk two and from.  Coming back, some of the guys would give me a ride to the train, but I had to walk there in the morning.  So after that, I decided that I did not want any more of Northeastern, and I didn't want any more of the co-op.  And so some friends of mine had--found out about Emerson, and I looked into the program and I transferred.
Speaker 1: So this is the thing.  Northeastern--so you didn't like the cold--did--where did you co-op--do you co-op, do the co-op the first year?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Oh, so it just starts the second year?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Because that's what it distinguishes it.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: You know, from them--now, would there be--who--did you make friends at Northeastern?
Speaker 2: I had a lot of friends, even to this day.  And Northeastern, you know, we were--was kind of tumultuous, too, because we protested a lot of what was going on with the administration, and we ended shutting down the school for a period of time, took over the dean's office, and I became fairly involved in politics of the college and then beginning politics of Boston.
Story_ID: 147211
Speaker 1: Okay. And was there--you know, I was wondering, maybe they came later, because I know [HM] Napoleon Jones-Henderson, and now I think, those are artists, but they had sort of set up a place to paint over there, or they were affiliated with--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: The Artists in Residence.
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: I'm familiar with them.  I was right across the street from the black institute, [John D. O'Bryant] African American Institute [at Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: But what--the thing about it is, is that this is a time of talk.  You know, this is still on the--it's--would be lessening, but there's a lot of agitation going on, you know.  People, whether around classes or treatment of minorities and all of that, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  The African Studies program, the dormitories, the African-American Institute.  So there was a lot going on and, as a matter of fact, there was so much going on in my dormitory freshman year, all the black guys got together and we got our own floor.
Speaker 1: (Laughs).  But this was--but it was also the fun times though, too.
Speaker 2: Oh, it was great.
Speaker 1: Could you--I mean, there are so many people in Boston [Massachusetts].  There're so many schools.
Speaker 2: There are so many schools in--actually, the years that I was in college was the bubble of the most black kids on a percentage basis and absolute number basis, I think, that there ever has been.  And we were from all over, you know.  And the good thing about going to school in Boston [Massachusetts] we had kids from Boston, we had kids from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], Washington, D.C.; a few from Chicago [Illinois], and so we had a ball.  I mean, those were some of the best years of my life.  There we--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: I had very close friends, and so we just--and we were all over the city, you know. We had friends from Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], BU [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts], BC [Boston College, Boston, Massachusetts]; we traveled a lot.  And by the second year, we all had cars, 'cause the scholarships that were surpluses.  You know, they had surpluses to them.  And then several of us, we got jobs at the [U.S.] Post Office.  So you could work at the Post Office on weekends and at night, and so--sorting mail.  So we did that and made a lot of money.  And so we all had, you know, we all had plenty of money.  It was not a problem.  We weren't, like, starving college kids.
Speaker 1: Now, when did you meet [HM] Peter Bynoe?  Did you meet him later?
Speaker 2: I met Peter when I was at Emerson [College, Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: At Emerson.  Okay. Okay.
Speaker 2: Peter was at Harvard in the J.D. M.B.A. program, and he volunteered--there was a friend of his, Harold Stewart [ph.], he had the Boston Black Repertory Company.  And I had another friend from Emerson, Steve--Steven Ferrer [ph.], who also knew Harold Stuart from Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts].  And he got involved with the Boston Black Repertory Theatre, so I started doing volunteer work, working with the Boston Black Repertory Theatre, and that's how Peter and I became friends.
Speaker 1: You know, because he's older than you, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: He is older.  Now, the other thing, did you ever go out to places like Brandeis [University, Waltham, Massachusetts]?  No one ever came out to us.  We were so (unclear).  So when you mentioned both of them, I know, because it would take three trains, you know.
Speaker 2: Well, yes.  When I was at Northeastern, we would go out to Brandeis , but then we got banned because, I don't know, we got into a fight out there (laughs).  Brandeis and Tufts [University, Medford, Massachusetts], they didn't like people from Northeastern [University, Boston, Massachusetts], 'cause the one thing about the black kids from Northeastern, were most of them were blue collar.  They were--a lot were blue collar.  They went out of their way to bring in kind of, you know, good students, but from disadvantaged backgrounds.
Story_ID: 147212
Speaker 1: Like one of my roommates was-he was the son of a black gangster in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  He was a bona fide gangster (laughs).
Speaker 2: So you (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And as a matter, he was so much--his father was so much of a gangster, his son who was my roommate, he went by an alias.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  He came to the school, he had an alias name.  So the only people that knew his real name were the--well, I knew his real name, but he went--and it was a first and last name.
Speaker 2: His alias was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: His alias was first and last name.  It wasn't just the first name.  It was the first and last name.
Speaker 2: How did you find that out?
Speaker 1: Because his parents came up to school, and they introduced themselves, and they had different names (laughs).  So I went to him and I said, "What's this?  That's your name."  And he said, "Well, you know, I have--I go by another name."  And, you know, his father--it was--I mean it was classic, you know 1972.  Gangsters, you know, his father had the big hat and the long coat (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Like Shaft.
Speaker 1: And they drove a white on white Eldorado--no, it was a Fleetwood.  A white on white Fleetwood (laughs).
Story_ID: 147213
Speaker 1: Okay, so you get to Emerson [College, Boston, Massachusetts].  Now, what do you read about Emerson?  Or what do you see about Emerson that attracts you?
Speaker 2: Well, that they had one of the top television programs around.  And it was an up and coming school, and it was a small school but it was expensive.  And I had a couple of friends that had transferred over.  And so I decided--I went over and I checked it out and liked what I saw, and so I decided I was going to transfer.
Speaker 1: Now, did they give you money?
Speaker 2: The first--no.  And so I used the money that I had saved from working at the [U.S.] Post Office and some of the surplus money that I had left over from my scholarship, and then my parents [Hattie Keys and Arnold Holloway] chipped in a little bit.  And then I worked during the summer.  I worked constantly from that point on, and I then I paid for it myself and I took out some loans.
Speaker 1: So what did (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: And then the other thing I did was to accelerate getting out of school early, I went to summer school at a community college in Pittsburgh.  So I was able to reduce the amount of money that I had to spend.  And then by doing that, by going to community college, I was able to finish Emerson in a year and a half instead of two years.  So I got out.  I save a whole semester by getting out early.  And so that's how I was able to do it.
Speaker 1: Now, did you think their program was good, and how did it different from Northeastern?
Speaker 2: Well, it was hands on.  And Emerson only had a couple thousand kids versus Northeastern, which was 36,000 at the time.  And it was a very small school.  You know, the school was located in brownstones on Beacon Street and Boylston.  So--
Speaker 1: Where were you living at this point?
Speaker 2: I was living in Parker Hill [Massachusetts] at this time.
Story_ID: 147214
Speaker 1: As a matter of fact, Parker Hill [Boston, Massachusetts] was one of the centers of some of the problems with busing, because the kids were being bused into the Parker Hill school and that was 1974.  That was September of 1974.  As a matter of fact, that September, I had some real problems.  I got into an altercation in Faneuil Hall [Boston, Massachusetts]which was the first day of busing, and the first day of school at Emerson, and so I was chairman of the Black Student Organization.
Speaker 2: At Emerson [College, Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 1: At Emerson.  And I (laughs)--I got--the vice-chairman and I were going with the dean to go buy fruit for a reception of new students at Fana Hall.  And Faneuil Hall in those days was a Farmer's Market.  And so we go down to Fana Hall and the dean drops us off.  It's a black dean.  He drops us off and the woman, it's a woman that I'm with, and we go buy some fruit, and she's going to buy some oranges and some apples and such.  And she takes a take and starts putting--well, first the--she says, "Give me a dozen," or a half dozen, whatever it is.  So the proprietor beyond the fruit cart starts taking fruit from the--not off the display, but from underneath the display and put it in a bag and he hands it to her.  She looks in the bag and the fruit is rotten.  So she says, "I don't want this fruit.  I want this fruit."  So she takes the fruit out of the bag and then takes the fresh fruit that's on display.  And the guy says, "Don't touch the fruit."  So, you know, this is an aggressive sister and she's got a big Afro, and she says, well, you know, in so many words, choice words, "We're not going to buy anything from you."  So then she's says, "Come on, Doug, let's--."  And I'm just standing there watching.  I'm not--I'm just there, you know, as to help carry stuff, not to really do anything.  So we walk away, and the guy starts yelling at us and calling all kinds of obscenities at us. And then he attacks me.  And so we get into a fight, and I came out on the winning side of the fight.  And so then we walk away again and his friend comes with a dolly, and he's going to--he's going to throw this dolly at me, I guess.  So we run.  I said--you know, I told her to just run.  And so we ran and then I run up under a truck and then some guy out of nowhere and grabs this guy and tells me to just get out there.  So I end up running--I don't even know where I ran at that time.  Just luck happens as I ran into the dean in his car.  And we would ride around and pick up the other sister, and then we leave.
Story_ID: 148221
Speaker 1: There were very few restaurants around.  You had to get in a car and drive to a diner.  And after the first week, they wouldn't serve me.  So I got into a verbal altercation with one, I guess the waiters behind the counter, whatever.  And they told me never to get in--come in the store again.  And so I went back, I guess it was a couple of days later, with the white guys I worked with and they still wouldn't serve me.  So they threatened to call the police on me, and the guy pulled out a knife, said he was going to cut me up.  So from that point on, then the white guys used to take me out and they would keep me in the back of the van, because they--the guy had a van.  So they'd go in and get my food and bring it out to me.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean it was bad.  You wouldn't think of it that way, I mean.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It was very bad.
Speaker 2: That was surprising.  Really.  And it didn't--it got--really the busing made it--well, I don't know if it made it worst, but it just--the--everything was heightened--it was made for years.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  As a matter of fact, you know, I very--you know, I lived in Parker Hill [Boston, Pennsylvania], so I would generally not walk in the neighborhood by myself, 'cause there were issues.  And then, you know, even in Kenmore Square [Boston, Massachusetts], like, you know, we wouldn't--we wouldn't ever go to Kenmore Square because you could get attacked in Kenmore Square.  As a matter of fact, I had gotten chased in--over near the Emerson Campus one night.  I was on--I had a radio show and I got off at twelve or one o'clock at night.  And I'd come out of the radio show and some guys came down the street in a car and started throwing cans and bottles at me.
Speaker 2: So why did you live in that area?  Why did you live in Parker Hill?
Speaker 1: It was--there was just a bunch of students, you know. It was cheap, nice housing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Okay.  Right.
Speaker 1: You know.  It was convenient to a lot of--it was convenient to BU [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts], Northeastern [University, Boston, Massachusetts], Emerson [College, Boston, College].
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: So a lot of students lived up there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 148222
Speaker 1: How active were you?  I know you mentioned the Boston Black Repertory Company.  How--were you active with that or just--you just volunteered on productions?
Speaker 2: I just volunteered.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay. So you have a conversation with [HM] Peter Bynoe, you know, around this time, you know, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was it around this time or is this after you graduate or is it while you're there?
Speaker 2: No.  It was while I was there.  It was when we were working for the Boston Black Repertory Theatre.  We were working on a production of 'Raisin in the Sun' [Lorraine Hansberry], and Peter did the books.  And so I asked him, you know, about his program that he was in at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  You know, there was a J.D. M.B.A., and I didn't know what an M.B.A. was.  So he told me what an M.B.A. was, and I was, you know, fascinated by him being able to, you know, understand the financial aspects of this business, because I didn't know anything about that.  And so I became very intrigued by it.
Story_ID: 148223
Speaker 1: And during the same period of time, I had a job working at WEEI Radio, which was an A.M. all-news radio station in Boston [Massachusetts].  And I was a news writer.  And I wrote the--you know, it was a twenty-four hour news station, and WEEI was a twenty--hour news station.  And so I worked, I think, the morning shift.  And one day I was walking down the hall of the radio station and I see this tall, good-looking, well-dressed black man.  And I said to one of the guys I was with, I said, "Who's that?"  And the guy said, "Oh, that's [Eugene] Gene Lothery.  He's the general manager of the station."  So I said, "Really?  Wow, a black general manager."  And the station was an O and O of CBS; owned and operated station of CBS.  So I walked up to Gene and I said, "Excuse me, but I'm a student at Emerson College [Boston, Massachusetts]. I'm here working part time, and I'm a news writer in the newsroom, and I just wonder if I could come and talk to you about career advice?"  So he said, "Sure.  Set up a time and come in and see me."  So I set a time with his secretary, and I--it was about a week or so later, and I had my one blue polyester suit that wore.  I had put my suit on and I went to see him.  And he said, "Well, you know, what do you want to do with yourself?"  And I said, "I want to be a television director."  And he said, "No.  But what do you want to do long-term?"  And I said, "I don't know.  I guess be a television director."  He said, "Well, think about what you want to do ten, twenty years from now; where you want to end up in your career.  Plan your career that way."  And I said, "Really?"  So I--he said, "You know, yeah," he said, "write a plan on your career, like a business plan."  But I didn't know what a business plan was, but--so he said, "Just, you know, write a script for your career."  So I went back and I thought about it, and I thought about it.  And around the same time, I'm getting involved in the politics of Boston and protesting against school busing opposition (unclear) and marching, going to Washington [D.C.] and marching, going to--marching and protesting in Boston, and getting very involved in media.  We were having issues with the administration of Emerson [College, Boston, Massachusetts], because they wouldn't allow the black students to really participate.  And so I then was running the Black Student Organization, but the protestors shut down the school.  So I was becoming very aggressive, racially aggressive with respect to wanting to change media and the policies.  So through all this, I decide that I want to run a television company.  That's going to be my twenty-year plan that I want to run a television company.
Story_ID: 148224
Speaker 1: And so I start to research the heads of the three networks and other television companies and find out that most of them are either salesmen or lawyers.  And I go to my dean, who was a black dean, Dean Shelton Forrest.  And this is a funny conversation, because, I said, "Well, Shelton, I decided where I want to do, and I want to go to grad school and get an M.B.A. (laughs).  And he laughed at me and in a very affectionate way.  He was--we were very close, and he said, "Well, that's very admirable, but I don't know how I can help you 'cause I don't know much about M.B.A.."  And I said, "Well, you know, it's even more complicated 'cause I want to go to Columbia University [New York City, New York] (laughs)."  He said, Well, I really can't help you there because no one has graduated from Emerson [College, Boston, Massachusetts] that we know of and gone on to get an Ivy League degree, let alone an MBA.  So, you know, you're going to really kind of do your research.  I'll do what I can, but, you know--you know, I think is--is one's on you."  So I decide that I want to go to Columbia because Columbia is in New York, all the television companies are in New York, and media is centered in New York.  And I had worked out a plan where I wanted to be a president in twenty years, and I wanted to work in all of key disciplines; production---I had already worked in news; I'd done some production, wanted to do some more; I wanted to work in finance, marketing, and then I was going to do--have most of my career in sales, 'cause that's where a lot of the heads of the networks and television companies were coming from.
Story_ID: 148225
Speaker 1: By this time, turned around my grades [at Emerson College, Boston, Massachusetts] and I'm an honor roll student.  And I decided that I'm going to apply to the COGME [The Council on Graduate Management Education] schools and the consortium of graduate management study schools.  And those were the schools that had good scholarship and recruiting minorities into the MBA programs.  And so, since Columbia [University, New York City, New York] was my first choice, I decided that I would go to New York [City, New York] and get an interview at Columbia to try to increase my chances, 'cause I wasn't the typical student that was going to go to an Ivy League graduate school and certainly not get an M.B.A.  So I get an interview, and I come to New York and there's a middle-aged white woman who's my interviewer, and she asked me, "Well, where are you from?"  And I said, "I'm from Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]."  And she says, "Where?"  And I say, "Homewood [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]."  And she looks at me and her eyes get big.  She said, "What street did you grow up on?"  And I said, "Upland."  And she can't believe it.  She's like, "Really?  You're here?  You want to go to Columbia and you're from Homewood on Upland Street?"  I said, "Yeah."  She said, "I grew up on Upland Street."  And she was part of the white flight, her family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And she couldn't believe that she was sitting here with a black student that had gotten out of Homewood and was wanting to go to Columbia.  And the irony is that Columbia was the only graduate school of the top schools that I got into.
Speaker 2: That's--now you--I want to ask you, how did the--was it difficult?  'Cause back then, you could set up appointments, right?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: In the college process to set up interviews.  So you had gone down there.  Had you applied at this point?
Speaker 1: I had not applied at that point.
Speaker 2: So did you apply?  So (laughs)--so, she got you (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Well, no.  I had applied.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: You had applied.
Speaker 1: I had just applied (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And then you were going to (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 1: And I (simultaneous) for an interview.
Speaker 2: --for an interview?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Wow.  And so she said that--what did she say?
Speaker 1: She said, "This is remark--you have a remarkable story.  I think you'll make a good student."
Speaker 2: So what did you tell her though?  You said that you wanted--what was your story?  Why did you-- what would you do if you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Well, one, I (simultaneous)---
Speaker 2: --got in?  What?
Speaker 1: One, I told her that, you know, I got bused and all the problems.  She knew of all of the problems in Pittsburgh and busing at that time.  And then I told her that I wanted to be a president of a television company.
Speaker 2: That's amazing.  See.
Speaker 1: And she was amazed by the story, and I guess, she made the difference.
Speaker 2: So you got in and that is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I got in and I got a (COGME?) Fellowship.
Speaker 2: Now, explain the (COGME?) Fellowship.
Speaker 1: (COGME?) was an organization that gave minority, primarily black students, fellowships to go to graduate school.  And there were, I think, five graduate programs that were participants.  And so they gave you a pretty large, I'd say, 50, 60, 70 percent--I forget what the number was--of your tuition every year.  And you had to come up with loans or contributions for the rest.
Story_ID: 148226
Speaker 1: So you end up in 19--so you graduate in 1976, and by the fall you're entering Columbia [University, New York City, New York].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you take the year off?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: So I got out of Emerson [College, Boston, Massachusetts] a half year early.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  Early.  Okay.  That's right.
Speaker 2: And then I couldn't get a job in Boston [Massachusetts] in television.  So I moved back to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] in February.  And I started networking, and I got a job at OIC [Opportunities Industrialization Center] of Rev. Dr. Leon Sullivan's organization; Opportunities Industrialization Center, and they wanted to start a program to get people jobs in television and radio.  And so they wanted me to teach a licensing course to get the first class FCC [Federal Communications Commission] license.  Now, while I was at Emerson, I took a course and I would pass--and got my first-class FCC engineering license.  In those days, you, to work a camera or to be an engineer at a radio station, or to be an engineer at a television station, you had to be a first-class license recipient.  And it was a fairly rigorous course.  And you had to take a test, standardized test, and you had to pass.  So there were very few blacks anywhere with those licenses back then.  So I got the job at the OIC to teach this course.  And so I taught the course to, you know, to disadvantaged people from the Hill District [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] and from Homewood [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] that were part of--that signed up at OIC to get jobs in television.
Speaker 1: So did you go from--so you went from there into school then in the fall?
Speaker 2: So I worked--I worked at OIC from, I guess, March all the way until August.
Story_ID: 148227
Speaker 1: And then in July, a mentor of mine at Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], who, one of the people that connected me with that job, Regis Bobonis, he was a newspaperman, and also a reporter and a PR [public relations] guy in Pittsburgh; he got a grant to do a bicentennial special on blacks in Pittsburgh, and this is in 1976.  And it was a multimedia production.  So it was going to be a newspaper supplement; it was going to be vignettes for television, and it was going to be vignettes for radio.  So he hired me to produce and put this project together, along with his daughter.  And so I was entering--so he hired me that July.  We started the project in August.  And in order for me to do it, what I had did was, took one last class at Columbia [University, New York, New York] in my entering semester, and I would travel on the weekends to different parts of Pennsylvania producing and shooting this multimedia special and researching it.  And we completed it in November, and it debuted in December of 1976.
Story_ID: 148228
Speaker 1: And then, what I ended up doing is, I picked up the full course load in the fall--in the spring semester.  And then in my second year, I signed up to take a full load and then an independent study.  And my marketing professor, Morris Holbrook, was a jazz aficionado.  And so he took a liking to me, and I sold him to be my--sold him on the idea to be my sponsor for an independent study.  And since he was music, and I was into music, he said, "Well, okay.  I'll do--I'll sponsor as long as you do an independent study on music."  And so what we did, we decided to use multi-dimensionally scaling regression analysis to predict music preferences based on psychographic information of individuals.  So at that time, there was a jazz radio stations in New York out of the Riverside Church [formerly WRVR].  So I went up to the station and met the general manager, a guy by the name of Dennis Waters, and I sold him on the idea of letting me research his listeners on this study, and if he would try to use some of the information, if he would work with me to use some of the information to see if we could, you know, preprogram his radio station.  So he agreed.  So for the next six or eight months, we worked on this study.  And we reprogrammed his radio station and his ratings went up.  So by the time I graduated Columbia [University, New York, New York], or was about to graduate Columbia, he, myself and my professor decided that we would form a research company.  And Dennis Waters was very good friends with Bob Pittman.  And Bob Pittman, at the time was working at WNBC Radio in New York as the program director.  So during that next year when I graduated Columbia, we worked on a study for Bob Pittman to help him reprogram his radio station, which we did.  And so when I came out of Columbia, what I decided that I wanted to get into NBC [National Broadcasting Company].  NBC had what was called the Associates Program.  And the Associates Program would rotate you through different departments, you know, for two years, and you'd land into a job.  And so I was applying to the Associates Program, and I was also applying to consumer package goods, marketing, because I wanted to get marketing training, and the consumer package goods firms were--would give you sales training.  And because I ultimately wanted to go into sales, I would learn--I would have had my training in selling, and then I would also have gotten experience in consumer package goods marketing, which was, at the time, the most respected companies.  And so my choice was General Foods.  So I went to work for General Foods, got a good offer to go to work there.  And I got my assignment that I wanted, which was in the main mill division.  I ended up working on Shake 'n Bake.  And I got my sales training in Atlanta [Georgia], because I wanted to live in Atlanta.  And so they gave me pretty much everything I wanted, and I stayed at General Foods for, I guess, twenty months.
Speaker 2: So you worked for General Foods in Atlanta--not in Minneapolis [Minnesota], but in Atlanta.
Speaker 1: No.  Atlanta and New York.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I did sales training in Atlanta, but my job in product management was in New York, in White Plains [New York].
Story_ID: 148229
Speaker 1: So how is it that you do so well in business school?
Speaker 2: Well, I came to New York and Columbia [University, New York, New York] with a new mindset of discipline, and I guess this is where kind of my family's Eastern European work ethic kicked in.  The summer before I came to Columbia, I took up yoga, and I also took up transcendental meditation.  And so I decided that I was going to get into a Zen state to be able to handle the stress of going to Columbia.  And not knowing what to expect in New York and not knowing to expect in the rigors of Columbia, that I was just going to discipline my way through it.  And so I practiced yoga and meditation every day.  And I just studied.  And because the first semester I was traveling almost every weekend, and then I'd have late night calls after I got my school work done with some people that were helping me produce, I had to become extremely disciplined.  And that's what I did.  And I just worked all the time.  And I ended up getting very good grades.
Speaker 1: You know, what is shocking to me--I mean, this description is sort shocking because, sometimes people, when they don't get it early in life, they struggle throughout the rest of their life.  But you must have had native intelligence I'm just saying that.  A lot of people can't do that.  I don't care, yoga or anything (laughs).
Speaker 2: (Laughs.)
Speaker 1: (Unclear).  I'm sorry.  Okay.  The Transcendental Society, they ought to use you as a poster child.  Though they are trying to bring that to inner-city youth.
Speaker 2: I still practice.
Speaker 1: You do?
Speaker 2: Not religiously, but I still practice.  Yeah.  It helps.
Story_ID: 148230
Speaker 1: You work for Shake 'n Bake, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, around that--was--Ann Fudge was there much later, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She came after.
Speaker 1: Right.  She came--
Speaker 2: I was there with Paula Wynn.  No, not Paula Wynn.  Oh, shoot.
Speaker 1: Paula--.  Paula Black?  Okay.  Okay.  That's okay.
Speaker 2: I forget Paula's last name.  Anyway, Paula was from Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], and she was a year ahead of me, and she worked on oven-fried; the launch of oven-fried, which at the time was one of the biggest launches at--of a consumer packaged goods at the time.  And I helped Paula on oven-fried, and we became very good friends.  And she helped me with my career.  I struggled at General Foods initially.
Speaker 1: You did?  Was it the corporate environment?
Speaker 2: Some of it was the corporate environment, and I was--I was very--I was different.  I was, you know, very principled.  I had a beard.  It's funny, because all--I was the only--I think I was the only grad student in my class at Columbia [University, New York, New York] that didn't shave during the interview process, and then didn't shave when they got their job.  So stood out, and I, you know, I just--you know, there were very few people that I worked with that could really relate to me, and so it was kind of, you know, it was a stark lesson.  I didn't have any clue to the environment that I was going into.  And I was doing a fair amount of partying, kind of making up for the years that I was, you know, focused at Columbia.  And, but, you know, I got what I needed to get out of it.  And I didn't plan to stay there very---I didn't plan to stay and go through, you know, years of promotion and that sort of thing.  I was there for a specific task, and that was to learn marketing and to learn sales.
Speaker 1: Do you feel they taught you well?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  It was a very disciplined, very rigorous job.  You know, we worked fifty, sixty-hour weeks, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Back then too, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And you know, we didn't have--we didn't use computers really.  Everything was done by hand, so you really had to know--even in Columbia, you know, when I got to Columbia, you know, they had just come out with the business calculator.  When I got to Columbia, I didn't even own a calculator the first semester.  I didn't get a calculator, really, until midway through the first semester, and it was just one that added and subtracted.  And then, I guess later, I got the business calculator.  But we had to learn internal rates, return, their present values; all those things, all of the modeling, regression analysis; we did it all by hand.  And then we used the calculator.  It wasn't--you know, we had access to computers, but we really didn't use them for many of the classes at all.  Everything was done by hand.  So the work was very rigorous, and you really had to know what you were doing, check your stuff, because there was, you know, there was no spell check--it was (laughs), you know, there were--none of the shortcut conveniences of doing work now.
Speaker 1: So, you were--were you in what they call brand management?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I see.  Okay.
Story_ID: 148231
Speaker 1: Were there any African Americans in positions of authority?  No?
Speaker 2: Well, Lee Archer was in HR [human resources] at the time when I was there, and, you know, Lee was a Tuskegee airman.  He was the only Ace of the Tuskegee Airmen.  But I didn't know any of that about Lee at the time.  I just knew that he was, you know, high up.  You know, he was in HR.  I really didn't have any contact with him.  And there was Paula that was there, and there was another guy in--he was a product manager in Coffee, and there was another guy that was in desserts.  But there were not very many of us in product management.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 145754
Speaker 1: So one of my good friends from Emerson [College, Boston, Massachusetts], [Robert] Rob Edney, he also went to Columbia Business School [New York, New York], and he was in the business school and journalism school graduate program.  And he was from Boston.  We became good friends at Emerson.  We were both in the TV program there, and talked about both of us going to Columbia.  He ended up coming out of Columbia and he got a job at CBS in finance.  I didn't want to go into finance at that time out of Columbia.  I wanted to go into marketing.  But he decided he wanted to go into finance and chose a job at CBS.  And I had, as I mentioned earlier, I had applied to the NBC Associates' Program.  And it was funny.  I got it--was to get into the program and was to get my job offer.  And the day that I was to have the final sign-off interview was the big snowstorm of 1978.  And not knowing what to do, and the subways were shut down, the buses weren't running, 'cause the snowstorm happened overnight.  I ended up walking to NBC [National Broadcasting Company] from Columbia.  And I get to NBC, it was closed.  No one was there.  I couldn't get in.  None of the people who I was supposed to have a conversation with that day were there.  And so I never got my final offer letter.
Speaker 2: So the--just because--how did that--I mean, just because things--the snowstorm was so big that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I never got rescheduled.
Speaker 2: --they just never got--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yep.  I never got rescheduled.  So, fortunately, that happened, and I ended up going to General Foods.
Story_ID: 145755
Speaker 1: And so my friend, Rob [Robert Edney], was at CBS and he was working in the finance department in strategic planning.  So he calls me up one day and says that they're getting ready to expand and hire some more people.  And he knew that I was really unhappy at General Foods and wanted to get back into the TV business.  So I came and I interviewed and I got the job.  And, you know, it was good news, bad news, actually for me because it was a really tough place to work.  I went from the fire into the frying--from the frying pan into the fire, from General Foods to CBS.
Speaker 2: So can you describe that?  What you mean by that?
Speaker 1: Well, I--well, CBS was a very structured--it was even more structured than General Foods at the time.  There was a dress code.  It was during the [William S.] Bill Paley days.  He was still chairman.  It was classic television.  If you ever watched the TV show 'Mad Men?' That was CBS.  You know, everybody was very formally dressed.  You couldn't wear brown suits or shoes.  You had to wear blue suits and gray suits and pinstripes.  You couldn't wear pink shirts.  When you left your office, you had to wear your jacket.  You had to socialize.  You know, it was a very big part of it, and drinking at lunch and after work.  And it was a dog-eat-dog business.  And since we weren't strategic planning, we worked for the vice president of finance, and we worked for the president of the television division, the broadcast network.  And so it was a very, very aggressive place. Very political.  And so you were either eaten or you were--you either ate or you were eaten.  And I didn't play and didn't want to play the corporate politics at that time.  And I got assigned to--I was kind of like a--I worked for a guy and a woman who were very aggressive, and they had very high aspirations.  And so they wanted to take over different areas of the company, and they wanted things under their control.  And so I was assigned two things:  One, I was assigned--I was a new kid on the block--to become an expert in new technologies.  And in 1980 or '79 (1979), new technologies were satellite communications and cable television.  So nobody wanted those two and I got them.  Second thing I was assigned to was to go and do kind of search and destroy other areas.  So I would go work with people in another department, find out all the dirt, come back, report on it and then they would use it to get them fired or demoted or some other, you know, control.  And there was this one guy that I liked.  He was in another department.  He was in the (unclear) relations department, operations.  And so they sent me out to get him.  And I was having a lot of trouble internally doing the assignments that I was given.  So I let him--I let this guy know what they were planning for him.  So he was able to put up his own defense and build up his own defense.  And I think the woman that I worked for and her boss, I think they figured it out that I must have tipped him off, 'cause, you know, he was able to really put up a strong defense.  And after that, they made my life miserable.  They really made my life miserable to the point where, you know, I couldn't sleep.  I was just a wreck.  I mean, they literally, every single day made my life unbearable at work.  And so, at the time, there were some black women in HR, and they were doing developmental training.  And so I became friends with them, and they put me through different courses on how to survive corporate America.  How to survive; maneuver your way through your career.  And so what had happened was I got blackballed.
Speaker 2: By the two?
Speaker 1: No.  I got blackballed by my bosses.
Speaker 2: That's what I'm saying.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: By the two bosses.  I'm sorry (unclear).
Speaker 1: So I couldn't buy a job at that time.
Speaker 2: So you couldn't move (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I couldn't move.
Speaker 2: --any place because they would block you.
Speaker 1: Right.  And I was trying to move internally to CBS because I wanted to get into sales, 'cause now I had finance and I had strategic planning under my belt.  But I was trying to get into sales.  And so they just put up all sort of roadblocks.  And then I tried to leave CBS, and nobody would even talk to me.  I was like poison meat.
Speaker 2: So who were the two of them?  Did they end up doing well at CBS?
Speaker 1: They did--the one woman, her name was Kara [ph.].  I don't know--she didn't last much longer after I left.  I don't even know where she ended up.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: The other gentleman, her boss, Ron [ph.], I see him today at--you know, he's still around.  He's retired pretty much now, but he's still around.  I saw him recently on the street.
Story_ID: 145756
Speaker 1: Can you talk about the overall broadcasting industry at that time, and what are the issues that they're dealing with, and what were some of the strategic--you know, issues that were presented in terms of strategic planning?  Was it growing the market share?  Was it, I mean, what was it?
Speaker 2: Well, one, at CBS and at all the broadcast networks, there were very few blacks.  There were, maybe, one or two in sales, one or two in finance, nobody that I knew in programming, a couple in news, radio.  But it was a very stark, very white business. And this is in 1980, right?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so we all kind of knew each other.  And we started an organization called Braining to try to promote blacks in the industry and support them.  And then at--what was going on strategically was, you know, Ted Turner was getting ready to launch CNN [Cable News Network].  The Madison Square Gardens Sports Network had launched, which later became USA [Network].  ESPN [Entertainment and Sports Programming Network] was in development.  MTV [Music Television] was in development.  And so there was a lot of concern about, you know, what's going to happen--were these--will these new upstart networks, you know, perform, will they get distribution, cable is not going to go anywhere; there were only a couple million cabled homes at the time, because the big cities hadn't been wired other than New York City [New York].  And most cable was rural and some suburbs, but mainly rural and in places where you had reception problems because of, you know, antenna fade.  So there was also the issue of the use of satellites to transmit the signals because at that time, all of the signals from the broadcasters to the local TV stations were done via landline.  And they were just beginning to use satellites for backhaul, but they were expensive and they were not that reliable.  And then there was the new technology, upgrading the studio facilities.  I worked on that.  All the plant, the ENG [electronic news gathering] cameras, you know, the wireless cameras and use of microwave was--all those things were in development.  And those were all projects that I worked on for CBS.
Story_ID: 145757
Speaker 1: And so one of those projects was CBS Cable, which was the cable network.  And there was a woman by--Charlotte Shift-Jones [ph.], who was a producer. She produced the People television show, and she worked for Time, Inc. on People magazine.  And she was married to [HM] Clarence Jones, who was Martin Luther King's lawyer.  And she convinced Bill Paley [William S. Paley] that he should start a cable network and it should represent the quality of CBS, because it--at that time CBS was the number one broadcast network, and it was called the Tiffany Network, because of the class and style of Bill Paley.  You know, you had the signature Bill in Black Rock.  You know, he was a patron of the arts.  And so what they decided is that they would make a cable network that would be an arch channel, a high-end arch channel with music and dance and theatre, and it was called CBS Cable.  So around this time, Bob Pittman goes over to work at the Star Channel, which later became the Movie Channel, and it was owned by WASAC-Warner Warner-AMEX Satellite Company.  And it was a joint venture between Warner and American Express.  And so now there's this guy, Dennis Waters, who used to work at the radio station, a jazz radio station that I convinced--he was the program director--where he's putting on seminars about new technologies.  And so he has me come speak at some of these seminars.  And one of the guys that was coming to speak was Bob Pittman.  And Bob Pittman's talking about music television, that which later becomes MTV.  And so when CBS cable is being formed, they hire a guy who is--knows a lot about cable.  He was intellectual and his name was Bob Mariano, and he was hired to head up marketing and affiliate relations for the CBS Cable Channel.  And Bob Mariano came from Columbus, Ohio, where he worked on QUBE.  He was involved in QUBE, which QUBE was the Warner Cable System that started in Columbus [Ohio], and it was the first interactive cable system.  So Bob Mariano was friends with Bob Pittman, because they were both part of Warner.  So I went to Dennis Waters and got Dennis to convince Bob Pittman to talk to Bob Mariano to hire me in the affiliate relations area, which were sales for CBS Cable.  And so they hired four sales people:  myself; Mark Rosenthal, who later became president of MTV; Nora Ryan, who was at Showtime as head of programming, and now she's at EPICS, head of programming; and Mariah Duny [ph.], who's out of the business.  So it was the four of us, and we divided up the country.  I had twenty-five states, and we each went around the country selling CBS Cable to cable system--cable system on planes, trains, and automobiles; all over.  And so that's kind of how I got into cable, and that's how I cut my teeth in the programming side of the business.
Speaker 2: So first of all, QUBE was very--I mean, it was very much touted in the industry, because it was sort of forward thinking.
Speaker 1: It was two-way.
Speaker 2: It was two-way, and it was interactive before there was interactive.  And then the other thing that sort of strikes me, what happened to your boss--so they weren't able to prevent--
Speaker 1: No, because I went outside.  That's why I went to Dennis Waters and Bob Pittman.  And because they brought Bob Mariano in from outside the company, he was coming from Columbus, I was able to--
Speaker 2: To (unclear).
Speaker 1: --to circumvent.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 145758
Speaker 1: So talk about those early days of going around.  And you said what part of the country did you have?
Speaker 2: I had twenty-five states starting with Ohio, going straight--you just draw a line from Ohio across the country to Bakersville, California, and everything north.  But since there were only four of us, we often did double duty.  So I would double up with people in the East that covered the Northeast and the Southeast, because there was a--there were more cable systems there, and there was more density.  Because out West, there was a lot less density, so I would have to often go out on the road for two weeks at a time in order to meet and make appointments from state to state.  Plus, in those days there were--each state had a cable convention.  So I would travel to all of the regional and statewide cable conventions, 'cause that's where we did a lot of our business.  But because there were no computers, really to speak of, everything was done from a fact book and by telephone, you know.  It was pretty rigorous work, because you would stay in your office, it was just dialing up cable companies, making an acquaintance, trying to sell, and then making an appointment to get on an airplane or multiple planes and then drive from city to city.
Speaker 1: This is the earliest--early--earlier days.  I want to say earliest--or earlier days (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: This is 1980, '81 [1981].
Speaker 1: Right, of affiliate sales.
Speaker 2: Right.  It was the beginning (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: It was the beginning (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --of affiliate sales.  There were only, you know, maybe fifty people; seventy-five or 100 people that were doing it around the country.
Speaker 1: So where--what systems and things are you putting in place?  'Cause even what you're promising people, you know, the pricing, the percentages, all that you're--are you working out and who are you competing with then in the whole?
Speaker 2: Well, at the beginning we were free.  We were giving it away.  And it was ad-supported.  And then, in the case of ESPN [Entertainment and Sports Programming Network], ESPN was paying cable operators to carry it.  They started and, you know, everybody was--everybody had a different name then.  ESPN was the entertainment, sports programming network; A&E was Arts and Entertainment network; Lifetime started as the cable health network; USA started as the Madison Square Garden [MSG] sports network, then it became USA Network, and then they recreated the MSG Network.  HBO [Home Box Office] was around.  HBO.  BET [Black Entertainment Television] started as a weekend insert on the transponder of USA, two hours on Satur--Friday and Saturday nights.  And so there were very few, you know, networks in those days that were competing.  But there were also very few cable systems, and there were very few channels on the cable systems.  You know, a lot of the cable systems only had seven or ten or twelve channels.  So you were competing to get on those, you know, those channels, the very few that were available.  You know, and then they started increasing to sixteen, twenty-four, thirty-six.  And so, you know, more and more cable systems were being built.  But it was--the cities were just being franchised.  So, no, there--I don't believe when we started there were probably not even 10 million homes in the country that were wired.  And there was no satellite.  So it was a--it was a really hand-to-hand combat type of thing.  And CBS cable went out of business, because we were losing so much money, and there was an internal fight at CBS between the broadcast network and the cable guys.  And so they forced some unreasonable pricing on the advertising on the CBS Cable to prove a point, because they didn't want it to really survive, because the broadcasters were pooh-poohing the fact that cable was not a long-term viable business.  And so, you know, it was one of the first cable network casualties.
Story_ID: 145759
Speaker 1: And then so what happens after that then?  'Cause you do that for how (unclear)--
Speaker 2: A year and a half.
Speaker 1: Year and a half.  And then, what happens after that?
Speaker 2: So after that, I go to Jim Rosenfield, who was president of CBS Television Network at the time, and we had had a good rapport, because when I worked in strategic planning, I was responsible for the strategic plan, and also was involved in writing speeches for him.  And so he, you know, he liked me.  So he went--I went to him and he tried to get me to stay and asked me, you know, what I wanted to do.  And so we talked about it.  And at the time I started interviewing at Time Inc., and Time Inc. was creating a start-up called TV Cable Week, and it was going to be of a weekly television guide custom made for each individual cable system.  And it was going to be the first guide, weekly guide, at the time that would have local broadcast listings on a regular basis, because the computer systems weren't invented that could get the broadcast listings, 'cause it took six weeks to compile the broadcast listings in a market for the networks.  So it could only be done on a monthly basis, and for half the month you wouldn't have accuracy, because then they changed the programming lineups.  And, but there were no weekly guides.  The weekly guides were only for cable systems, but they didn't have any broadcast listings in them.  So Time Inc. decided they were going to create a weekly guide, and they created a massive computer system that could handle processing all the data and producing a guide on a weekly basis.  And it would be customized for each individual cable system.  And they were looking for affiliate people.  And so, I got a job working at TV Cable Week as one of the affiliate people.  And so we sold guides to individual cable systems.

Speaker 1: The problem was, there was an internal strife at Time Inc., and Time Inc. was--owned the cable systems, and it was called ATC, American Television and Cable and they owned publishing and they owned HBO.  And so people on the video side of the business, the HBO and cable system people, were vying for power with the magazine and print people.  And so, they staffed the company, TV Cable Week, with print people and not anybody from video.  And so when we--we went out to sell it to the ATC Systems, they made sure that it was not a success.  And then there was another thing.  One of--the guy who was head of Acquisition Marketing came from the print business.  I think he worked for Time magazine at the time, a young, smart guy.  His father was a bigwig at Money Magazine.  And he came up with the idea of attaching the subscription of the magazine to the cable bill, and then handling any delinquencies like they did it at the Time in their traditional magazine business, which were done in letters and threatening, threatening mail if you didn't pay your bill on time or if you canceled.  And so when we rolled the magazine out, and I launched the magazine and the most cable systems of any of the sales people, and it created--oh, and the other part, it was a--we gave a free sample, and it was a negative option.  And that's when--that's before negative options were outlawed.  And we did a negative option, and then people automatically got billed.  Well, once that happened, people went berserk.  They called the Attorney General's, they stormed the cable system offices, they canceled their cable subscriptions, they--just--it just was a nightmare across the country.  And after a year, we lost $48 million.  And we had this huge infrastructure, and because of the infighting of the video versus print people at the company, they shut it down, and then they wrote a book about it.  One of the editors wrote a book called 'The Fanciest Dive [What Happened When the Media Empire of Time/Life Leaped Without Looking Into the Age of High-Tech,' Christopher Byron].  And it was about the internal struggles of--it was the beginning of the struggle between print and video at Time Inc., and now, as you know, video has won out (laughs), in a big way.  As a matter of fact, they're spinning off the print and they're loading it up with that and, you know, it's been downsized and, you know, it's on almost life support.
Story_ID: 145761
Speaker 1: So that now is 1982.  And '82 [1982] would be--it was--no, 1983.  And Time Inc. owned one-third of USA Network.  And USA Network was a startup company couple years old.  And it was run and it had been founded by Kay Koplovitz, and it was--actually it had been started by a cable company, UA Bob Rosencrans of UA Cablevision, UA-Columbia Cablevision out of New Jersey.  And Kay Koplovitz had worked for UAColumbia Cable doing franchising.  And UA Columbia Cable teamed up with Madison Square Garden [Network], and they created this company called Madison Square Garden Sports Network, and then Kay was the president--they made her president--she was a young woman--made her president.  And then what they decided to do was turn it into a sports and entertainment network.  And they renamed it USA Network, and they added entertainment.  And so it was like, really like, it was a syndicated version of, say, CBS or ABC [American Broadcasting Company] at the time.  And it was owned by Time Inc., Paramount Pictures and Universal Pictures, and those three companies didn't get along.  And at the time, HBO, which was owned by Time Inc., was doing the affiliate relations, and they had been giving USA Network away as an incentive for people to increase their distribution of HBO and also launch Cinemax.  And they really did some shady deals, some bad deals.  And the movie studios got upset, because they thought that they were getting taken advantage of and that USA wasn't going to reach its full potential.  So they decided that they didn't want HBO to handle the affiliate relations, and sales or marketing anymore; that they wanted to start their own group within the company.  So I got--I was then presented to Kay Koplovitz as a candidate to come in and do that.  And I had become good friends with Don Anderson and Stan Thomas.  And they were pioneers in the business, and they were at HBO [Home Box Office].
Speaker 2: Can you talk about--'cause I--Don Anderson was one of the--he was African-American.  I don't--Stan I don't know.
Speaker 1: Stan is an African-American, too.
Speaker 2: Too?  They both (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Stan came out of politics.
Speaker 2: So they both were at HBO?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Stan was in New York in national accounts; vice president of national accounts.  And Don Anderson ran the L.A. [Los Angeles, California] office for HBO, and he was one of the early, first-hires in affiliate relations.  And so I had gotten to know them, because when I was at CBS Cable, a group of blacks in the industry started the National Association of Minorities in Cable [NAMIC].  I was part of that group, which is still in existence, NAMIC.  And so, you know, they had taken me under their wing, and they were kind of my mentors and they were, you know, really senior in affiliate relations.  So they had offered me an opportunity to go to HBO and work in affiliate relations at HBO.  And then I got a job offer to go work for Kay, to come in help start up the affiliate relations group for USA Network.  And when I talked it over and flushed it out with the two of them and really thought about it, I decided to go with USA Network, because I was going to be there on the ground floor, and there was lot of more upside, I thought, as opposed to going into the factory of HBO at the time.  So I did, and I was the first person hired in the affiliate relations and helped to set that up.  And then they hired a person senior over me, Gil Fasio [ph.], who came over from MTV, and the two of us set up the department and ran affiliate relations.  And we did that together, and we hired other people, opened up a Chicago [Illinois] and L.A. [Los Angeles, California] office.  I ran national accounts, and he ran everything.  And he--we did that together for about four years, and then he left to go to Financial News Network, to head up affiliate relations.  And I, in a political shootout, got the top job at USA.
Story_ID: 145762
Speaker 1: So when you say that there was a political shootout and you want--who is the shootout with if you're--the person Gil--
Speaker 2: Fasio [ph.].
Speaker 1: Fasio leaves?  He leaves, right?
Speaker 2: He leaves.
Speaker 1: So who is the political shootout with?
Speaker 2: So there were--there were five--four--no. (pause) At the time, there were five senior reports to Gil.  There was myself and four other women.  Two of the women were much older; Barbara Kirbach [ph.] out of L.A. [Los Angeles, California]; Carolyn McCrory out of Chicago [Illinois]; Betsy Dirnberger [ph.] out of New York; and then Jody Crabtree [ph.] also out of New York.  And so the two women in New York were in competition with me.  Betsy was the frontrunner, and she was an older woman, and she was really kind of a real tough woman, very aggressive.  And so we battled it out for about five or six months.  And part of the issue was--this is now 1987--and in 1986, Time Inc. got into a spat with the movie studios, and they pulled out.  They sold their third share to Paramount and Universal.  They didn't want to be in bed with them anymore.  So now the studios have total control, and we report up in to the division--the television divisions of Paramount and Universal.  And Universal at the time was a very ugly place.  It was still being run by [Lewis Robert] Lew Wasserman who was chairman, the last Hollywood mogul, as he's known as.  By now, he's a statesman.  But his--and Lew Wasserman started his career as a gangster in Cleveland, Ohio; part of the Jewish Mafia, I guess, really; and Jules Stein, you know, when they were forming the music business, the way, in its modern form.  And then they moved to Hollywood and went into the television and film business.  And [Sidney] Sid Sheinberg, who grew up in that environment, was just as ruthless and cutthroat as you'd ever want to be.  And so then on the Paramount side you had Mel Harris, who was a gentleman, statesman, who was president of television; and Lucie Salhany, who was a tough, you know, hardnosed executive, and they ran the Paramount business.  So they didn't want me to have the job.  At the time, there was no black executive that was running a major cable business, television business, in any facet of the network.  You had [HM] Johnathan Rodgers, who, at the time, was now running CBS News or stations out of Chicago; and you had Gene [Eugene] Lothery, who was running the radio business.  Now he had moved up to the radio business in New York.
Speaker 1: And you had met him.  That's who you met--
Speaker 2: That's who I met in Boston [Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: --in Boston.
Story_ID: 145763
Speaker 1: And so, you know, and there were no black studio executives that I knew of at the time, and certainly not in the television business.  So they really were opposed to me getting the job.  And Kay Koplovitz had taken a liking to me.  We had worked very well together, and she was the president of USA [Network].  And to their opposition, she gave me the job as vice president of affiliate relations.  And at the time, that was probably the biggest--other than Stan Thomas and Don Anderson--the biggest responsibility of any black executive on the programming side of the business.
Speaker 2: So what made her make that decision?
Speaker 1: She was an obstinate person, you know.  She was a contrarian in some respects.  She also was an advocate for women and minorities.  You know, she was very supportive of all my activities with NAMIC [National Association of Minorities in Cable], and she was, you know, she was just a big advocate for making change.  And she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And you're, what, how old at this point?
Speaker 1: I'm thirty-three.  And I--I came out of business school when I was twenty-three, so my career was on a pretty strong trajectory.  And I joined USA when I was twenty-eight.  So by the time I was thirty-three, I was promoted into the top job.
Speaker 2: So what did she see in you though?  Did she say that?  And can you describe her a little bit more, too, besides, you know, you said she was...?
Speaker 1: Well, she's a hardcore business woman.  She's very bright, and she was in the cable business at the very beginning in terms of the programming at the cable (unclear) cable business, certainly.  And she, you know, considered--she's a petite woman, you know.  Her name is actually Kay Smith, and she married Koplovitz and--but she's very hardnosed.  She was the first person to really bring big sports to cable television with the Madison Square Garden Sports Network.  And so she's had to duke it out with, you know, hardnosed men in the entertainment and sports business from the very beginning, not to mention she was in franchising during the franchise wars, and, you know, she was fighting against the likes of [Charles] Chuck Dolan and Warner-Amex [Satellite Entertainment] and such.  And so, you know, she's a real tough--but very--when you meet her, very affable, very gentle, but she holds her own.
Speaker 2: And you had started there, I mean, you know, you were--remember, you had said it was she and you--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --at the beginning, you know.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Well, in the affiliate relations side.
Speaker 2: In the affiliate relations side.  But the other thing is, what happened--if she's an advocate for women, you won over the females there, someone older than you, too, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --so when you're made--when you're promoted, what happens with the other--the ones that were competing with you?
Speaker 1: Well, Betsy Dirnberger [ph.] left and went to work for Gil Fasio [ph.] at FNN, Financial News Network.  And then I went on to have a long lustrous career at USA.  And I got promoted up the ranks from vice president to senior vice present to executive vice president.  And this goes back to the beginning of my career story.  Within twenty-one years, I'd become president.
Story_ID: 145764
Speaker 1: So, can you talk about the growth of USA [Network] today and the changes that happened and some of the issues you were dealing with during that time?  Because, this is a time that, you know, what you're--a little skipping over--you know, well you had mentioned that, you know, the cities hadn't come on, but by this time, the cities were starting to come.
Speaker 2: The cities are being built (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Built.
Speaker 2: --when I--during my years at USA, the cities were being built.  And we--the business is becoming more sophisticated.  In 1987, Ted Turner had become very successful with CNN [Cable News Network].  He has TBS [Turner Broadcasting System], he has the Atlanta Braves.  And then he and Kay Koplovitz are rivals in the industry, because they both had general entertainment networks, and they are the predominant basic entertainment networks.  And so, he decides that he was going to try to be directly competitive with the cable network with USA, and he announces TNT [Turner Network Television].  And he comes out with a plan that's going to have one rate for everybody.  And in those days, the rate cards for the basic cable networks were very complicated, had a lot of discounting.  And so we were really kind of coming into the modern age of more simplified rate structures and such.  And so, he convinces Glenn Jones, who was, I think, the third or fourth largest cable operator at the time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Jones.
Speaker 2: Jones Intercable--to launch TNT, and I believe it was September of 1987, and to drop USA.  So after Ted comes out with his announcement earlier that year that he's going to come out with this simplified rate card, he's going to take, you know, subscribers from USA, 'cause it's still very competitive to get on cable companies, because the cable companies now only have thirty-six, forty-eight channels, maybe fifty-six; they're talking about having 200; but they still haven't really had the big build-outs where, you know, subscribers were easy to come by.  And, you know, maybe there're 30, 40 million homes now with cable.  And so in response to that, I come up with a plan that is going to simplify our rate card, and over a three-year period have three, five-cent rate increases.  'Cause we were about twelve cents on average, and Ted Turner was coming out with TNT at a twenty-five cent rate.  So with that much of a rate differential, he would have been able to be more aggressively competitive to get programming and sports on TNT and away from USA.  And at the time, USA had golf, tennis; I believe we still had some baseball and some college sports and WWE [World Wrestling Entertainment].  And so we sent out a rate notification, and everybody had to send the acceptance back or decline by July 31st by registered mail.  And somewhere in the middle of August, we get a letter not registered from Jones saying that they declined the rate increase.  And long story short, in September, Greg Liptak, the president of the cable company, comes to meet with us and says, "You know, tomorrow, which is when Ted pulls the switch to turn on TNT, you're going to be dropped in 1.3 million homes," which was one of the largest drops of its time at that time, and it was a substantial percentage of our distribution.  So, in fact, they did.  We tried to get a temporary restraining order, we failed.  And then they dropped us the next day.  And so the movie studios went berserk.  We filed suit, and for the next two years we were off, and we were in--we actually kind of created what now you see, when a cable company drops a broadcast or a cable network, all the tactics that are used, were those tactics that we created; going to the local politicians, running ads, setting up 800 numbers; and we did that for two years in all the Jones franchise areas.  And there was no satellite distribution.  There was no DirectTV or anything, so we couldn't use that.  It was just try and get back on.  So through the deposition process in the court case, breach of contract, we deposed the secretary of the general counsel of Jones, and she admitted that she had backdated the postal meter on the letter that was sent us.  And so once that came out, then we settled, and I negotiated kind of a landmark ten-year agreement, because in those days, agreements weren't ten-years; they were generally three.  So we did a ten-year agreement, and we got back on all the cable systems.
Speaker 1: So she backdated it to what--now, what--
Speaker 2: She backdated it to a date in July, which would have been prior to the expiration--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --of the notification.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: You had to notify us by July 31st.
Speaker 1: I--so they hadn't really notified in the sufficient time that she backdated it to say (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: But even though they hadn't notified us, they didn't notify us correctly, because it was supposed to come back registered, and they didn't send it registered.
Story_ID: 145765
Speaker 1: Also with the affiliate sales, aren't you trying to also negotiate your channel position?  You know, I mean, where you're actually located on the dial and--
Speaker 2: We were negotiating channel positions, we were negotiating--one of the other things that was happening at this time was cable advertising was still in its infancy on cable networks, in terms of local cable advertising by the cable operators.  So they were inserting ads, but they were not really making much money.  And one of the things that we decided at USA [Network] is that we would put a lot of money into training the cable systems' ad sales groups on how to sell and package and price the networks' inventory.  And by so doing, we would make our inventory more valuable, and we would help them grow their business.  And the more they grew their business, it would benefit us.  And so we put a lot of money into marketing and to promoting our local ad sales business.  The other thing that we did going into the early nineties was, I pioneered a target marketing.  So, you know, as the networks were growing, and you know, we're gaining momentum in terms of viewership, we discovered that minorities liked USA Network.  It was comfort television for them.  And the liked the fact that we had a lot of action adventure.  And we were pioneering a lot of action adventure series.  As a matter of fact, we had one of the first scripted original series called Air Wolf.  Air Wolf was a CBS television show about a helicopter, a combat helicopter.  And so, when it was canceled on CBS, we bought it and started--went back into production with it.  But we used all the original helicopter action scenes so that they didn't have to recreate all the action scenes.  So we made it much more affordable.  And then they shot it in Canada.  So that was kind of a pioneering thing that USA did.  And so what I started was target marketing.  So we hired an African American agency, a Spanish agency, and an Asian agency.  And then we customized all of our marketing materials that we would send out to the cable systems for these different ethnic groups, and actually helped USA become number one in all of the cable ratings back then, and we never looked back.
Story_ID: 145766
Speaker 1: Now what ended up then being the relationship between Kay [Koplovitz] and Ted Turner?  Ted Turner was totally bombastic and would try to eat people for lunch, denigrate operators, you know, if he was upset with them.
Speaker 2: Ted Turner was a character.  He has admitted to being bipolar and in those days, you know, acted like it.  He was, you know, hard drinking, hard partying.  As a matter of fact, when I was leaving TV Cable Week, when it was being shut down, I got recruited by his head of affiliate relations, Noretal Braun [ph.], who I had known through the business for a long time.  And so they gave me a job offer, and to seal the deal, they wanted me to come fly down to Atlanta and meet with Ted.  And so Nore [ph.] flew me down to Atlanta [Georgia], and we went and hung out--I'll never forget, it was the weekend of the Kentucky Derby--went to a Kentucky Derby party, and Nore, was, you know, selling me on why it's such a great deal to come work for Ted, and he had a convertible Jaguar, and we were riding around Atlanta in his Jag, and then we ended up going to the Braves game at the stadium with Ted and his wife, and I think one of his sons was there, and Nore and his girlfriend.  And we sat in Ted's box right off the first baseline.  And I guess by the sixth inning, Ted was drunk (laughs).  He was yelling at the umpires, he was spitting tobacco on the field, and he took off his shirt (laughs).  He was quite a character.  He was quite a character.  Long story short, I ended up not taking that job, and I ended up taking the job at USA Network.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was character.  He was.
Speaker 2: He was a character.  So, you know, he was--and he would be degrading to Kay and, you know, he didn't like the movie studio guys and, you know, he was very, you know, a very aggressive business man.  He bought, you know, at that time, he bought the MGM [Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer] library and kind of fed it into TNT [Turner Network Television] and TBS [Turner Broadcasting System].
Speaker 1: I mean he was smart.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yes.  He bought the Hanna-Barbera library.  As a matter of fact, we were competing with him to buy the Hanna-Barbera [Productions, Inc.] library, which he then created the Cartoon Network.
Story_ID: 145767
Speaker 1: And so, going into the early nineties, there was a rush for everybody to get big and launch new channels.  Channel--the cable operators were expanding, the cities were now built, and they were growing rapidly.  And so as part of that, one of my jobs was to identify new revenue opportun--new business opportunities.  And so I was scouring for new networks and coming up with ideas for new networks.  We looked at buying a number of networks at the time.  And it just so happened I was at a cable show and met one of--a former Cox [Communications] employee, Eric Kalawski [ph.].  And he was working for a startup network that was trying to get off the ground, and it was called the Sci-Fi Channel [later SyFy].  So he introduced me to his boss, Mitch [Mitchell] Rubenstein, and Laurie Silvers, and they kind of pitched me on the idea of, you know how big sci-fi [science fiction] is, particularly in bookstores and movies.  And I came back and I pitched the idea to Kay, and then we ended up buying the rights to the Sci-Fi Channel, and we launched the Sci-Fi Channel.  So I was part of the whole concept of creating the Sci-Fi Channel and selling it.  And at the time when we launched in 1992, it was one of the biggest launches of any cable network ever.
Speaker 2: So can you talk about it?  So you're saying you're at the cable show, and they approach you or you approach them?
Speaker 1: No.  I'm just walking the floor--
Speaker 2: You're walking the floor, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --and they have a booth.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so I stopped at the booth because I know this guy, Eric Kalawski [ph.], and he's now working for them.  But they haven't launched, they just have a concept.  And so we get to talking and he sells me on the concept (laughs).  And so I know that we're trying to start or buy new cable networks.  So I come back and I pitch it to Kay [Koplovitz], and then we ended up buying the concept, and we launched the network.
Story_ID: 145768
Speaker 1: So when you launched that [Sci-Fi Channel, later SyFy], how much of investment did you make into the--?  Do you know the--
Speaker 2: I believe we've paid $15 million for the concept.  And we spent, I want to say, probably fifty, sixty million dollars before it turned a profit.  And one of the problems, and it almost was shut down, because in, I believe it was 1993, '94 [1994], the government was feuding with cable operators.  And that's when the whole process of the 1994 Cable Act was being put into place.  And so what the government did was, they put a freeze, because there was so much concern about cable operators raising prices and gouging consumers on pricing and offering poor service, that they put a freeze on launching new cable networks for almost a year or so.  And there was a freeze on price increases.  And that freeze was right in the infancy of the Sci-Fi Channel.  And so we just were dead in the water.  We couldn't sell it.  They--we couldn't get launched.  Very, very little.  There were special circumstances where you could, but we couldn't meet our targets for growth.  And without the growth, we couldn't generate new and more advertising revenues.  And we couldn't put marketing in--dollars in programming and marketing.  And the studios who were so cost conscious, were becoming very impatient.  And so, they wanted to shut it down.  And fortunately, just as they were thinking about shutting it down, the freeze got lifted, and we had substantial growth right after that, which saved the business, and saved probably my career at the time, because I had this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Because you were--you were the one who brought the project.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then I was the one who was responsible for selling it and then the other thing that was going on was the rebuilding of the cable systems.  And so there was a lot of tiering going on.  And the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Explain the tiering, 'cause that--
Speaker 2: Well, they created higher packages, higher priced packages that were full smaller services, and there was--they were launching networks, but they were putting them on these smaller packages; and so some of USA's distribution in those days was going into these smaller packages.  Well, the movie studios didn't like that.  And so, given their aggressiveness, they wanted, you know, USA [Network]'s--more growth, they wanted it faster, and they wanted it more profitable.  And so I was kind of at the forefront of that.  And it was funny, 'cause I'm on the executive committee of USA at this point, and so I sit in on all the board meetings.  And I became the target of all their animosity, anger, and aggression.  And since they didn't want me in the job anyway going back, they made an example out of me in those meetings.  It was so bad at one point, all my fellow executives from USA, we would go into the board meetings and they would take a seat, and then everybody would move away from me.  So they would joke at it and say, "We don't want any more blood splashed on our nice"--'cause in those days, everybody wore Armani suits,"--so it's like, "You know, my cleaning bill on my Armani suits is getting too high, so I'm not going to sit next to you 'cause I keep getting splashed."  Because I would go into these meetings, and they would just wear me out, in particular, Tom Wertheimer, who is from Universal [Television].  And he was very, very aggressive, and just a--you know, he came out of the--he worked for Sid Sheinberg, and so that's they were just, you know, aggressive, you know, mean guys.  Which is funny 'cause now Tom sees me, he's very nice to me.  He's now retired.  But they would--it was really--it was an arena.
Story_ID: 145769
Speaker 1: Okay, so what--how do you survive all of that though?  I mean, is it the staff that you brought in?  Because you're sort of telling a fairytale story.  I mean, you're--I know that there're ups and downs, but your rise keeps going really up.  But who do you have around you, and who is mentoring you and sort of looking out for you?  The only reason I say that 'cause you had mentioned that, in the one instant, this is many jobs back, you know, they put you through some courses.  You know, you were put through courses.  I don't think that was Kay [Koplovitz].
Speaker 2: No.  That was at CBS.
Speaker 1: That was at CBS.
Speaker 2: Well, Kay becomes my sponsor.  She becomes my sponsor, guardian angel.  And, you know, I--we have a very good working relationship, and she really kind of battles for me with the studios.  And, you know, I am battling with the studios, and I'm battling with the cable operators, and I surrounded myself with a pretty good team.  I spent a lot of money on development, the team's development.  And then I'm also working on my personal development.  I'm taking courses.  I'm very active in the industry.  She tells me that she wants to support me and wants me to become very active and a statesman to the industry, so I get involved in CTAM [Cable & Telecommunications Association for Marketing].  I'm already running NAMIC [National Association of Minorities in Cable].  And I become a supporter of all the industry initiatives.  And in so doing, I become very high profile.  I do a lot of speaking.  And I travel.  And then, what we engaged in by now is entertainment becomes a huge part of the cable television business.  And so we have the French Open, we have the U.S. Open, we had tennis matches around the country.  And so we start to entertain very heavily.  Oh, we had the Masters Golf, plus other golf events by now.  And so what happens is, I start to use entertainment and golf as my way of becoming like an asset, not only to my business, but also to cable operators, because I become like Johnny Appleseed.  And I get to know all of the senior guys in the cable business, because they all--by now, they've all kind of switched from playing tennis to playing golf.  And since we have the Masters, and I had taken up golf, I'd take all the senior guys once a year to the Masters, and then I let them play of the Monday after during media day.  And then we pick up the Ryder Cup and we start taking people to Europe to play golf.  And we have the French Open, so we start taking people on the Concord to Paris [France] every year.  And we have a suite at the U.S. Open, and we entertain there for two weeks.  So I become an entertainment maven and use this to promote my business.  And, you know, we get into kind of what people call classy entertainment.
Story_ID: 145770
Speaker 1: Who else is like you around at this point?
Speaker 2: Well, in the early 90s [1990s], L. Patrick Mellon, who is with TeleCable, which is a cable operator out of Norfolk, Virginia, they get bought by, I believe, TCI [Tele-Communications, Inc.] or Time-Warner [Cable].  I forget who.  Anyway, he moves over from TeleCable to ESPN.  And then he gets the job as head of affiliate relations for ESPN.  As a matter of fact, he's the one that's credited with the strategy on all the big rate increases of ESPN on how they've been able to become the biggest cable network in terms of revenue.  And then he dies in--around '99 [1999] or 2000 or something like that, an untimely death.  But I guess [HM] Johnathan Rodgers moved over from CBS--
Speaker 1: The Discovery Channel.
Speaker 2: --to Discovery Channel.
Speaker 1: Mm-mm.
Speaker 2: And then you've got [HM] Gayle Greer, who's very high at Time-Warner Cable.  And I'm--and there's me.
Speaker 1: Oh (unclear).  All right, because--and you have Bob Johnson--BET starts taking off (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: But, not in terms of the general (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: The major--the major networks.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: There's nothing, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, you had--
Speaker 1: Who else?
Speaker 2: Marva Smalls at MTV [Music Television].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And Christina Norman at MTV.
Speaker 1: But they're not at your--that--it's not at your level, I don't think.
Speaker 2: Well, they were slightly below me.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: At the time.
Story_ID: 145771
Speaker 1: So how do you--I'd also like you just to talk just a little bit in terms of context about the networks and the relationship.  You've sort of touched upon it, but, you know, at first cable is not really, you know, they're the ones sort of knocking at the door.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: 'Cause they need content.  But then it switches.  And can you tell me when it sort of switched?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Where they were--you know, where--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it's interesting. Kay Koplovitz always had the dream that we weren't so much looking at competing against other cable networks.  We were looking to compete with the broadcast networks and stealing market share from them.  And so, all of our focus is really on ABC [American Broadcasting Company], CBS, NBC [National Broadcasting Company] and Fox [Broadcasting Company] and to really outdo what they did.  That's really kind of where we put our focus on.  And so, everything we did was to, whether it was our marketing, whether it was our programming; and we started to move initially into original programming.  We're the first real big broad--cable network to move into original programming.  And we did it with movies, and then we did it with scripted series.  And one of the backdrops to all of this was the fact that, Universal [Television] was going through changes because Universal originally was owned by MCA [Music Corporation of America], and then MCA sold itself to the Japanese Matsushita [later Panasonic], and then Matsushita sold Universal to Seagrams [sic, Seagram], and Seagram ended up selling the domestic part of Universal, which was included, USA [Network] to Barry Diller.  And on the Paramount side, Paramount sold itself to Viacom [Inc.], and Viacom owned the MTV Networks.  And then they wanted to own a piece of Lifetime, I believe it was.  So they ended up selling the half that they owned to Universal. So then Universal owned it entirely, and then that--they sold the whole thing to Seagram.  And then Seagram turns and sells--splits the company, because originally it was the theme parks, television production, the movie studio and records, and both domestic and international.  And when Seagram sells it to Barry Diller, he splits the company and keeps records and international, and sells the domestic business to Barry Diller.  And Barry Diller combined USA with his TV stations.  He owned twelve TV stations, which were outlets for the Home Shopping Network, and he owned the Home Shopping Network [HSN] at that time.  And so he renames the company USA Network, Inc.  And so for the next five years, we worked under Barry Diller.  And Barry Diller ended up selling the company, but he maintained a share to Vivendi [S.A.], the French water conglomerate that owned water and Vodafone and some other--it was a conglomerate.  And it was run at the time by Jean-Marie Messier who was fixing the books and overleveraged the company, and then it was on the verge of going bankrupt.  And so Vivendi--
Speaker 1: Vivendi was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --or you--Okay.
Speaker 2: And so to--that--so he got pushed out, and he then--his successor to--started to scale down Vivendi, and they sold off Universal to NBC.
Story_ID: 145772
Speaker 1: Now, but where--Barry Diller, where is his--where is his role within--was he a positive influence in that?  'Cause I--that's why the--that, you know, he was Home Shopping [Network, HSN].  He really (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --he really (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: So--so, in '97 [1997] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So this is all--you're talking about really the nineties right here.
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Nineties (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: --into the early 2000's.
Speaker 1: And early 2000's.  Okay.
Speaker 2: So the company was sold to Barry Diller in 1997.  And then Barry Diller fired Kay Koplovitz, and from that point on, from '97 [1997] to 2004, it was just a revolving door of executives.  He brought in this guy by the name of Stephen Chao, who basically just obliviated the--well, he destroyed the company (laughs).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The programming, and it was a constant revolving door of executives.  The vice-chairman under--of USA Networks, Inc. was Victor Kaufman, who was a lawyer and a movie studio guy.  And so he was Barry's dealmaker.  And that's who I ended up reporting to.  So what happened was they created a new structure for the company, and the combined all the networks under my auspices for distribution and marketing.  So we had the Home Shopping Network, America's Store [HSN], USA Network, the SciFi Network [later SyFy].  Then we bought two other networks from the Canadian Broadcast Company [CBC], Trio and News World International.  And so all those were then under my auspices.  And at the time, Home Shopping Network was losing money.  And so I was part of the team, we helped to turn the Home Shopping Network around.  And then we had twelve TV stations.  And we had to--Barry wanted to monetize the value of the TV stations.  So we had to find--we had to take Home Shopping Network off the TV stations, get a channel for it, and the he sold off all the TV stations to Univision or $1.2 billion or something like that at the time.  And--and, you know, under the Barry Diller scenario, things were--those were the dark days, 'cause, one, he was abusive to most of the executives.  He wasn't abusive to me.  It was funny.  The first time I had a meeting with him, it was me, Kay Koplovitz, Jonathan Miller, who was then--who became head of AOL [America Online], and Victor Kaufman.  And so Barry enters the room, and we're sitting around a conference room, and it's I've got to give a presentation on all of our business, and where we're going in the future.  And Barry looks around the table, and it's the small conference room, round table, and he shoos Victor (laughs), 'cause he doesn't like people to sit close to him.  So he shoos Victor.  Victor slides his chair away.  And he says, "Well, Mr. Holloway, you can begin now."  So start into my presentation, and I guess about five minutes into my presentation, he asked a question, and I say, "Oh, that's a very good question, Barry."  And he says, with a straight face, "I'm here to grade you.  You're not here to grade me."  (laughs)  So once that happened, I didn't miss a beat.  I basically continued on with my presentation, and from that point forward, Barry never really messed around with me.  He never abused me or verbally abused me as many of the other executives.  They used to ask me--we would sit in staff meetings, they'd say, "How come he never gives you a hard time?"  (laughs).
Speaker 1: So what happened between he and Kay Koplovitz?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  And, you know, there's speculation, but, you know, Kay was a very dominant figure, and I think (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So--and he was strong--she was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I think he just didn't want another dominant figure in his sandbox.  And, you know, Victor Kaufman was his deal guy, and Victor Kaufman was his henchman.  So he didn't need anybody else.  And so what he did was, you know, he just brought in a revolving door of executives to kind of battle it out with each other.  And so it was a very hostile environment for a lot of years.  And he brought in this other guy from broadcasting by the name of Barry Baker.  And then he set--pit Barry Baker and Victor Kaufman against each other, and then they battled it out, and Baker ended up leaving.  So it was an intense five years.  And then the--then things kind of mellowed out when he sold it for two years to--he was still involved, but things kind of mellowed a little once it went to Vivendi.
Story_ID: 145773
Speaker 1: And then, you know, things changed radically by the time we got to NBC [National Broadcasting Company].  And by the time NBC bought it, I was the only senior executive on the business side that was still in place.
Speaker 2: From the original team?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Everybody else had gone.  And during the course of that, you know, I became a target of a number of new executives, because I had been there a long time, I was black, and I controlled a big piece of the business and I reported to the vice chairman.  And, you know, I was a target.  So for several of those years, there were a lot of executives, once in particular, the CFO for a period of time; his name was Peterman, his last name was Peterman.  Tim Peterman.  And Tim Peterman, his father, I think, had the Peterman Clothing Company, he was from Tennessee, and he was a bit of a good-old-boy.  He was younger, and I think he made it his--made up his mind that he was going to take me out, 'cause we were in a meeting once, and I had mentioned earlier in the conversation that we developed the local ad sales business to really promote USA, and we became very successful.  We became the poster child for networks in terms of the local ads sales business.  So this one particular day, I was--had been having issues with Peterman, 'cause he would tell me one thing and then go tell my boss something else.  And he would put one thing in an email and then say he didn't say it.  And so, we were in a meeting, and I had two of my lieutenants, two executive vice presidents that reported to me.  I was president of the division.  And he told me, he said, "Well, Bubba, I don't think you know what you're talking about."  And so the two guys that were sitting next to me, my two lieutenants who knew I still kind of a bad temper at times, they looked at me (laughs), and they're like, no this is not going to end well (laughs).  They knew that it was not going to.  But, I got to say, it probably saved my career what I did next, which was I didn't say a word, I got up and I left.  I walked out.  And at that point, I made it my business that I was going to survive the company one day longer than he was.
Speaker 2: So how did you set about to do that? I knew that he was trying the same ploys on other executives; one being, you know, the head of programming; and the other being the president of USA.  One of those people was Doug Herzog, who now is at MTV [Music Television].  He runs Spike [TV] and all of those networks.  And other was Bonnie Hammer, who is now chairman of USA Studios and all the networks, the cable networks there.  And so Bonnie and I worked for a long time, and Doug and I had become friends.  And I think by now I was a trustee at Emerson College [Boston, Massachusetts], and I think by now I had kind of gotten Doug to be a trustee as well.  So we had some commonality there.  And so I just basically let them know what he was doing and how he was going to undercut their business and their success.  And they took care of the rest.
Speaker 1: That's good.  And you had learned along the way.  I mean, this is back in your days at CBS.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: (Laughs.)  You had had good training at CBS cable.
Speaker 2: I did.  Although I had to pay a heavy price for it, it was good training.
Story_ID: 145774
Speaker 1: What other sort of critical things?  Because NBC [National Broadcasting Company]--you know, NBCUniversal, that lasted until--that lasted about ten--was that about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, it lasted until 2010.
Speaker 1: Ten.
Speaker 2: And so, in 2004 when NBC bought the Vin-Universal [Television] from Vivendi [S.A.], I was president of distribution for all their cable networks.  And David Zaslav, who was at NBC, was president of the NBC networks, and MSNBC [Microsoft National Broadcasting Company]--well, president of distribution for the NBC networks; MSNBC, CNBC [Consumer News and Business Channel], Bravo and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: DMA?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Oxygen.
Speaker 1: Oxygen.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, during the merger, NBC had the plan to get rid of all the Universal Television executives.  And what was interesting is, during the merger, before it was completed, I get a call one day from my general counsel, and she says, "Doug, you're being investigated for gun jumping, and so the SEC [securities and exchange commission] and the FTC [federal trade commission] are going to be coming up here to investigate you and your staff to see if you have engaged in gun jumping."  And gun jumping is what occurs during a merger, when the executives cooperate with the other company prior to them getting certain levels of approval.  So somebody had dimed on me or accused me.  And my thought was that it was somebody at NBC, because I was the highest ranking black person that was going to potentially survive the merger, and I had a stellar record in the industry, and I was a known--you know, I was pretty well known in the television business and particularly in cable.  So I don't think that they wanted--somebody wanted blood on their hands.  So if they accused me of gun jumping, I would either leave or they would find something and that would be grounds to dismiss me.  So the next six weeks or so I got investigated.  They came in one day, a group of lawyers and they told me to put my hands on my desk, and they explained to me that for the next couple of weeks, they were going to take over my conference room and that they were going to take all the paper out of my office, take--download my hard drive, and take any documents out of my briefcase.  And so they were going to ask me to leave, and I could come back when it was done, and that the next day they would bring it all back and put it away.  And then they were going to do the same to my direct reports in New York [City, New York], Chicago [Illinois] and L.A. [Los Angeles, California]. And that's what they did.  And then they came back, that we were clean as a whistle.  So then the merger occurs, and now they got to figure what to do with me.  So they combined my job with the job of David Zaslav, who is now chairman or CEO--not chairman--but a CEO president of Discovery Network.  And so they combine the jobs, and then have me report to him.  And then he creates--he and I had been friends in the business-- so he creates a job for me.  And so what they did, is they--NBC at the time owned 25 percent of A&E [Arts & Entertainment] Networks, 25 percent of National Geographic International, they had a joint partnership with the TV stations on the New Venture, the first digital broadcast called Weather Plus, and they were starting a new nonscripted production called Peacock Productions.  So--and they owned 30 percent of Shop NBC, which is a public company and a shopping service based out of Minneapolis [Minnesota].  So what they did was they took all of those businesses and they put them under my auspices, and I would be the NBC representative on those businesses.  And then I was to look for new business opportunities for them to expand into.  But in the meantime what they did was they took away my staff, they took away my budgets, and they put me in an office in 30 Rock [30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York City, New York] with a secretary.  And there I sat for four years.  And they didn't even--you know, people didn't even know I was still with the company, because I didn't really get invited to participate in senior executive activities very much.
Speaker 1: This is from what year to what year?
Speaker 2: 2004 to 2007, '8 [2008].  And then one day, I was at the Black Employee Forum for GE and several executives from NBC were there, you know, white executives.  And they are like, "Doug, you're still here?"  (laughs).  It was this big (unclear) somebody else.  They're like, "We didn't even know you were still at the company."
Speaker 1: (Laughs.)
Story_ID: 145775
Speaker 1: And so the head of affiliate relations was retiring for the broadcast network, NBC [National Broadcast Network].  And they wanted to turn NBC into more of a cable-like business, because NBC was losing money.  And now they owned USA, and USA was making--all the cable networks were making a lot of money, and NBC was not.  So they brought me into NBC to head up affiliate relations.  But NBC was really kind of backwards.  They didn't have anything computerized.  Everything was done on spreadsheets.  They didn't have a management information system that they were using.  The contracts were not computerized.  The staff didn't have BlackBerrys.  They weren't compensated with bonuses or anything.  And so, they bring me in, and then they want me to put together a business turnaround and pricing business for NBC.  Which I did.  I put together a model.  And my boss--well, no one at the broadcast networks really liked cable, and they were envious of cable, and they didn't understand cable.  And so we would go out with affiliates, the broadcasters, and if I ever--when I would often talk about some of the things that cable is doing and letting them understand why it was so successful and such, my boss didn't like that and told me never to talk about that again.  And so he and I really didn't gel.  And then the people that worked for me were old timers in the broadcast business, and they resented that they didn't get the job, and so between the two of them they undercut me.  And, at the same time, NBC was going through the process of the early mating dance with Comcast to be acquired, which I was aware of.  And the television business crashed.  So my model to turn NBC around--and there was investigation--they were looking at turning it into a cable network.  Well, all those plans fell, because to get a fee for NBC was going to be impossible based on what we were trying to do.  And they were saddled with long-term contracts with some of the big affiliate groups through 2013 to '17 [2017].  So we were going to have to unravel those contracts and renegotiate them.  But once the television business crashed, they weren't willing to do that, because NBC were paying them the affiliate fees.  They were--it was your first payments.  So they wanted--we wanted the affiliates to pay us like they were doing with Fox and ABC.  So once that happened, then they eliminated my job. And then I left NBC.
Speaker 2: I see.  And you left when?  In 2000--
Speaker 1: And nine [2009].
Speaker 2: Nine.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  What they did was, I had a contract, and so they paid out my contract and then they put me into early--they bridged me to early retirement.
Story_ID: 145776
Speaker 1: And then so what ends up next then?  Because--
Speaker 2: So this is at the, you know, the height of the recession.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Well, the height of the recession and the--right in the middle of the economic, you know, the economic meltdown.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right during the economic meltdown. So I started going through a divorce, and then I started to consult.  I consulted for an upstart network called One World Sports.  And then I got hired by--to do some consulting for American Express to create a online financial personal--personal financial management business called Pay You First.  And I was teamed up with Sharon Lechter, who is the author of--coauthor of 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad.'  And so American Express, at the time, was looking to monetize some of their intellectual property.  And they had intellectual property in the financial services area.  And some of those were in the area of personal financial management.  So we put together a business plan and mockup business for their personal financial management system.  And I did that for the better part of two years.  And then Kay Koplovitz who, during this period of time, had, after she left USA [Network], started a private equity firm to invest in women's businesses.  And then she became chairwoman of Liz Claiborne.  And she had some other things that she was doing as well.  And she ended up on the board of ION Media.  And ION was owned by three private equity firms.  And Carl Vogel who was at one point president of Dish Network, and before that he was president of Jones Intercable.  He was president Intercable, and he was CFO at Jones Intercable.  And going back to 1987 when Jones dropped USA, in 1989 when we settled the deal, I negotiated the deal to reinstate USA with Jones with Carl Vogel.  And so Carl Vogel is on the board of ION Media.  And so they decided that they want to do a changeover of their affiliate relations person and also start charging affiliates, 'cause it was for free up until that point.  So through my association with Kay [Koplovitz] and Brandon Burgess, who is CEO of ION Media [Networks] was EVP of business development at NBC.  And so he's the one that's credited with orchestrating the purchase of Universal from Vivendi [S.A.].  And after that happened he came over to what was then the Pax Network to be CEO.  And NBC owned a piece of that company at the time.  And but they divested themselves of Pax, because they ended up buying Telemundo that same year.  And so, Brandon came over here in 2007 and changed the name to ION Media.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So ION Media was Pax?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 145777
Speaker 1: This opportunity gets presented to you.  Wait you--so what happens then?
Speaker 2: So through Kay Koplovitz, she tells me about the opportunity, and then I end up interviewing with Brandon [Burgess] and joining [ION Media Networks] in 2011.  And so I've been here ever since.
Speaker 1: So what do you like about this--I mean, you're president again?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  (Laughs)  Okay.  So what do you think of this opportunity?
Speaker 2: It's a good opportunity.  You know, it's a business that's still growing.  It has a lot of upside.
Speaker 1: So what are wanting to accomplish here?
Speaker 2: Well, what we're trying to do is change the economic model for ION by turning it into a network that gets paid as opposed to just being free.  And we're a hybrid company.  We're a broadcaster--we're the largest owner of broadcast stations in the country.  Not the number of stations, but the most distribution of stations.  We own sixty stations which represents about 62 percent of the population.  And then the other (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: These are broadcast stations?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And then when we don't have broadcast stations, we're a satellite network like a cable network, like USA [Networks] or TBS [Turner Broadcasting System].  And so we're trying to get paid now for our carriage in the cable systems.
Story_ID: 145778
Speaker 1: What has changed about the dynamics of cable to begin with?  Is there still a need for, you know, cable channels?  Are you finding it's more competition?  Is there going to be some consolidation?  You know, I--
Speaker 2: Right now, there's a lot of consolidation going on.  If you notice, the broadcast affiliate groups, station affiliate groups are, you know buying each other up.  NetStar now owns the largest number of TV stations with 102, although they only represent about 18 to 20 percent of the households.  And Sinclair [Broadcast Group] is buying stations.  Gray [Television] is buying stations.  Tribune is buying stations.  And then on the cable network side, there's consolidation.  Discovery [Communications] is talking about buying scripts.  There have been a couple other deals that are in process right now.  And so, you're going to see consolidation all over the place, because hef [ph.] and market power is where everyone is going.  They're trying to get as much money out of the consumer and out of each other as possible.  And then, you know, on the horizon, you've got, you know, the competitors, older builders of AT&T and Verizon.  And then, you know, you have the potential of what is called over the top; you know, Intel was creating an over the top service.  Dish [Network] with Blockbuster was looking at an over the top service.  Not so--nonlinear internet is the future and Netflix, Amazon Plus and Hulu, you know, just to name a few.  So that's where everyone is trying to jockey for position.
Story_ID: 145779
Speaker 1: Doug, where do you think things will end up?  Because, you know, a lot of Google and those--and Netflix, they were looking like they were, you know, like, very serious competitors.  You know, you have young people who are necessarily paying for cable, you know, anymore. So--and the consolidation is interesting, you know, 'cause now, with the 1996, you know, Telcon Act, anything--anyone can buy anyone.  So it's--there're interesting consolidations happening.
Speaker 2: And you're going to see more of that.  And--well, I think what's going to happen in the next five years is that the industry is just going to be fragmented in all of these pieces.  So, you know, satellite, it will coexist with broadcast; it will coexist with cable; it will coexist with Telco, it will coexist with over the top.  And then there's some new technology that's on the horizon where they can create--they can build a satellite dish the size of a laptop computer, and can put it in your home instead of being out on the roof.  And so that's going to be a new technology.  It's going to go over the top, and it's going to be broadband, and it's also going to be television.
Speaker 1: So, if you--where do you want to go with your career?  You're still relatively young.  Unless you're thinking about retirement.
Speaker 2: No retirement any time soon.  I still want to run a television company, or I'd like to run an internet video company.
Speaker 1: 'Cause see, you see the growth there.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: With the Internet video.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I can tell.
Speaker 2: That's the future.
Story_ID: 145780
Speaker 1: I mean, really, your story is an amazing story.  And literally, when you talk about the others that were around, a lot of people have left, and haven't been able to sort of be productive (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yes.  I'm one of the--I'm the last of the old guard.
Speaker 1: Mm-mm.  And I want to talk about that in terms of NAMIC [National Association of Minorities in Cable], and I'd like you to talk about the history of NAMIC, because you were one of the founders.  And even, I learned the other day that NAMIC stands for something different--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you know, than minorities in cable.  So I just learned that the other day.
Speaker 2: It started off as the National Association of Minorities in Cable.  And now it's the National Association of Multiculturals in Communications [sic, Nation Association for Multi-Ethnicity in Communications].  And it began as a way to promote employment as well as entrepreneurial opportunities in cable systems and suppliers and networks.  And now it's really focused on employment and promoting, mentoring.  And it was originally black.  Now it is black, Hispanic and Asian and even a few white folks.  And, you know, it was started by a group of pioneers, what we call cable pioneers, of which I am also now a cable pioneer, which is a formal organization.  You've got to be in the industry twenty years and have had major contributions.  But we started with those ideals in mind.  And now it's really an educational organization as well as promoting employment and upward mobility.
Speaker 1: So let me ask you this:  Who are the original founders besides yourself?
Speaker 2: Nate Garner, Barry Washington [ph.], [HM] Gayle Greer, Don Anderson, and there are two other people that I forget, whose names; two or three others that I forget.
Speaker 1: And do you think now sitting from this vantage point of what you originally set out to do that you were able to do as an organization?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: Yes.  You know, one of the things that's happened is, we never got the ranks in senior management that we've been trying to get for thirty years.  We never really were able to get the entrepreneurial opportunities in big businesses that we should have that we tried to get.  And so, you know, a lot of monies been made by a lot of people in the cable business.  And the number of minorities, particular blacks, that have made money has really been very small.  And there was other than Bob Johnson [Robert L. Johnson] and those people that worked with him at BET [Black Entertainment Television], nobody really made much in the way of big money, myself included.
Speaker 1: And I think, you know, when you--I mean, that's somewhat of a travesty because just even being at Herb's funeral [HM Herbert P. Wilkins] the other day, I mean, there was a lot of hope, you know, and cable was, like, the ground floor.  You know, you were on the ground floor, and there was no specification at the time, you know what I mean?  It came in time, but there was none.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So I would like to--do you--in hind--do you think there are things that could have been done differently?  You know, because, you know, you don't--you didn't mention--you know, you mentioned the Chuck Owens' of the world, but there was the John Malones, you know, there were the Peter Bartons--well, he died.  You know, I mean, there are--you had--you mentioned Glenn Jones, but there was--that's where--that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, that--I mean, we tried, you know.  Nate Garner, [L.] Patrick Mellon, myself, we put together some companies to try to buy cable systems; we worked with others to try to start cable networks, and we just never could get the funding to get them off the ground.  And so, you know, and we all knew--you know, I worked with John Malone, I knew John, I knew--you know, there wasn't anybody that I didn't know in the cable business, including Brian Roberts, that I didn't work with.  But, you know, when it came to, you know, starting businesses or supporting us in businesses, and, you know, also the banks and the money people, we just never could really get it off the ground.

Speaker 1: It came to really funding a lot.  And then the programming, not having impact on programming either.
Speaker 2: Well, some of us did.  For me at USA [Channel], I had some impact on the inside, more of keeping programs off than on getting programs on.
Speaker 1: But I was much more able in my position to get--keep programs, certain kinds of programs off.
Speaker 2: So can you talk about that?
Speaker 1: Oh--there was a, you know, a movie they wanted to do about Huck Finn, and, you know, at the time, I thought the dialogue was inappropriate.  I, you know, work very diligently to get certain kinds of characters off the WWE, and characters that were misogynistic and that were racially biased or overly racially stereotyped against blacks and women.  Things of that nature.  The use of handguns in advertising.  So--and also just the images, the kind of images that we use in advertising, the kind of images we used in our original series and movies.
Speaker 2: Do you think, now, Doug, because it would be a shame to have all that--I mean all the knowledge you have go by the wayside--do you see that there are opportunities, you know, as we speak, in terms of African Americans in the new media or Telcon?  I don't know what we're calling it, because the broadcasters are saying they're not even going to be around.  They've been saying that for years
Speaker 1: Yeah, they'll be around. You know, the interesting part of it, throughout my entire career, you know, there's a lot of movement in this business.  And the number of head hunter calls, the more senior I've gotten, the fewer they come.  And, you know, it--a lot of it I--a friend of mine, we're talking about this just the other day.  It is what exists in this industry is the attitudes that were demonstrated in 'Twelve Years a Slave.'  You know, when Solomon Northrup goes up against the overseer and he tries to tell him what to do, and Solomon knows better and knows more, you know, he is beaten down.  And those same attitudes exist in this business.  And the more popular and the more notoriety that I've received, the more I've seen it, including people that worked for me.  So and it's really, you know, been a few women that have had a fair amount of power that have mentored and shepherded me, like Char Beales, who's a retiring, outgoing president of CTAM [Cable and Telecommunications Association for Marketing].  She became very good friends.  She became a big advocate of mine.  Another one is Ann Carlson, who, you know, runs Carlson Resources, one of the major headhunting firms.  But, beyond that, you know, not much has happened.  You know, the one big recognition I got from the general industry was the Vanguard Award from the NCTA [National Cable and Telecommunications Association] in marketing in, I believe, 1997, '96 [1996].
Speaker 2: So do you--what are your hopes--or do you believe that there are hopes?  'Cause, I mean, I loved 'Twelve Years a Slave.'  I've been talking about that, but to use it as an analogy, but there are a lot dashed hopes out there.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: And I don't--I mean, like I said, I'm on Comcast [Corporation], and I don't see, you know--I keep saying, like, it was in there executive ranks they have no one.  Even the committee--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --that they put together, I was the only one who even had a smidgen of--you know, background in the industry.  So people were just--they were just happy to be there.
Speaker 1: Oh, they have no powerful black executives.  At a company that big, it's a--
Speaker 2: It's a shame.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It's a slap in the face.
Speaker 2: It's a slap in the face.  But see, people don't know that because people get crossed off.  And then they surround--and then there's no one in there.  Because I was asking a lot of questions when I got back.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: And the other companies is the same.  I mean, the only one that really does is MTV [Music Television].  CBS doesn't.  Disney doesn't.  You know, and it was--they are there, they're in non-revenue generating operating roles or certainly non-programming roles.  They don't get much above the VP level.

Speaker 1: Doug, what do you think will make things change or different?  Do you--
Speaker 2: You know, you got to get lucky.  I got lucky.  I was at the right place at the right time, and I got sponsored.  And you got to get lucky.  You know, you really don't get to these high-level jobs without getting sponsored.
Speaker 1: That's true.  But you also--I mean, you don't need to denigrate that because you also work really hard.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you were focused.  I mean, you really worked hard.  And you had something or you wouldn't have even survived.  I mean, there are a lot of--there's a lot of carnage so--I want to ask you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, to that point, you said in--early in my--in this conversation, you said there's a lot of fighting going on.  And that fighting has helped me survive, because when you stare down the barrel of a gun, when you stand in front of somebody with a pipe or baseball bat or a knife or you take a punch to the face or to the gut, and you don't let it overcome you, then when you get to be my age in these corporations, you can withstand the hits.

Speaker 1: I'm going to ask you about the trajectory of your life, but I would like to go back to the state of the black community and the state of blacks in Telecom, but I mean, what hopes and concerns do you have?
Speaker 2: The concerns I have is that we have lost ground.  That there is a political as well as racial backlash.  That economically we in a worst position.  We potentially could be in a worst position politically after Obama leaves office.  There is a resurgence of, I think, racism in America right now, and also economic bias.  And the hopes are that, you know, I'm able to tell my story to the youth.  I try to at every particular instance.  I try to mentor and sponsor as many young people coming up as I can.  And I've got two sons, and hopefully they're learning their lessons.
Speaker 1: Can you give their names, 'cause I saw--can you give both of your sons' names?
Speaker 2: Douglas J. Holloway.  He goes by D.J.  And Marcus S. Holloway.
Speaker 1: And what are their ages now?
Speaker 2: D.J. is eighteen and a freshman at Syracuse University [Syracuse, New York] in the School of--the NewHouse School of [Public] Communications.   And Marcus is sixteen and he's a junior in Scarsdale High School [Scarsdale, New York].
Speaker 1: So D.J. is following in his father's footsteps.
Speaker 2: Well, he's creating his own footsteps.
Speaker 1: (Laughs)
Speaker 2: But, yes, he's going into the--he wants to go into the television or film business.

Speaker 1: If you had your career to do all over again, what would you do differently?
Speaker 2: Nothing.
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Other than I just wish I would have made more money.  And I should have, but certain things happened that it just went the wrong way.
Speaker 1: Why is it--was it the minus Kay Koplovitz?  Is that what--
Speaker 2: No.  Well, when we were owned--when USA [Network] was owned by the movie studios, they didn't give the executives any phantom stock.  We were privately held, and so we never had any phantom stock.  So when they sold the company and they sold it repeatedly, we never got any economic benefit.  And so, you know, the company, when I joined it, it was worth $24 million, and it ended up ultimately selling for $13 billion.  So I never got any economic benefit.  And when it was sold--when it was sold to NBC, I was bring in revenues of $600 million.  And the other thing is, when Barry Diller had bought the company and created, I--when he created USA Networks, Inc., he kept the Universal [Television] executives out of the stock plan for a year.  And so during that year, the stocks split twice.  And the year that he sold the company to Vivendi [S.A.], we were supposed to get a stock distribution of restricted stock in June, and then another group of options in December.  And he reneged on both of those, which were--between the two scenarios, under the Barry Diller scenario, it probably cost me three to five million dollars.  And under the USA scenario, probably ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty million; who knows.  So, really, I only got paid in cash, you know, just a salary and bonus.  You know, other of my counterparts that worked for public companies, you know, they made tens of millions of dollars (pause).
Speaker 1: Wow.  And the internet world has worked that way, you know.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: That's astound--did that also affect Kay Koplovitz too?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, well, you know, Bob Johnson [Robert L. Johnson] made $3 billion, and Ted Turner made $10 billion, whatever it was.  Kay Koplovitz, she got paid out.  She got paid out of her contract, and she only made ten million.
Speaker 1: That's unbelievable.  'Cause I mean she--she--when you--I think--I mean, I think I know her name.  (Unclear) big.
Speaker 2: No.  She never made big money.
Speaker 1: That is astounding.  There's no basis of a lawsuit by anyone?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head.)
Speaker 1: Well, were there too many (hats)?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head.)
Speaker 1: That is astounding.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: That's astounding.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, when people say, "Doug, you should be rich."  And what, you know, what--and all the money I did make is--has been eaten up by my divorce (laughs), and by the court system.
Speaker 1: I think you'll prevail.  Let's just say, I believe it (laughs).  That is--that's astounding.  I mean, astounding.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I should--you now, I should be wealthy, and you know, be at the--what I would have liked to have been by now is a philanthropist and started my own companies and done other things, but, no.  I have to work.  I have to work.

Speaker 1: Do you have a Kay Koplovitz story, you know, or memory that you'd like to share with us?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We were negotiating a deal with Time-Warner [Cable].  And Time-Warner Cable had not paid us for two years.  And so I had been negotiating this contract for two years or more.  And they didn't want to pay our rate increase.  So I scheduled a meeting with Kay Koplovitz; Steve Brenner [Stephen Brenner], who was our general counsel;, and my counterpart at Time-Warner, Fred Dressler, who's now passed; Andy Heller [Andrew Heller], who was his general counsel who just retired from Turner as president; and Jimmy Doolittle, who was president of Time-Warner Cable.  So we go up to Stanford [California].  Their offices were in Stanford and we're in a conference room.  And we--we've having a conversation, it's going okay, and Kay says to Jimmy, she says, "Jimmy," and Jimmy was a good old boy from South Carolina with a drawl, and he was a redneck.  And she says, "Jimmy, we're just not going to stand here and allow you to continue to not pay us and be your bank."  And Jimmy Doolittle goes off.  And he starts swearing, and he gets up out of his chair at this conference table and walks over to Kay.  Now Kay is about five foot five, a petite woman.  And he gets over her and starts swearing at her and puts his finger in her face.  So all of the rest of us in the room were stark--we're like, what do we do now?  And he says, "If you don't get the fuck out, I'm going to call security and have you thrown out."  And she stands up and looks at him, and she says, "Jimmy, I may be thrown out of here, but we're still not going to be your bank."  And so she looked at me, she looked at Steve, she said, "Let's go."  And we walked out.  And he said, "Don't you ever come back in here again."  So long story short, months go by, maybe another year, and we're not talking, we're not doing anything.  And Kay says, "You know, we're just going to have to be patient, because there's going to be a change in the sea.  Something's going to happen and we're going to be right there."  And so Time-Warner Cable decides that they're going to buy Cablevision Industries, another MSO.  And so just at that point, she said, "I got 'em."  And so they had to come back to the bargaining table, because they needed to get approval, and we were going to interfere.

Speaker 1: I would like to know what you want your legacy to be.
Speaker 2: I'd like my legacy to be that I made a difference for black people sitting at home watching television, cable television, and minorities in the television industry, and I (laughs)--and I would like my legacy to be that I made a difference for those people at home watching television and also all the minorities that are in the television industry.
Speaker 1: And what would you like to be remembered for?
Speaker 2: Helping others.
Story_ID: 145787
Speaker 1: What would you want your sons [Douglas J. Holloway and Marcus S. Holloway]to know about you that they don't know?
Speaker 2: That's a really good question. (Long pause) That I'd like them to know that there was another side of me.  That I could very easily been not successful.  I could have very easily ended up in jail.  Could have very easily ended up being a drug addict.  Could have very easily done things that would have been self-destructive, and that it was just the luck of the draw that I didn't end up that way.

Speaker 1: So what would you call, if you were--if you were writing a book on yourself, what would you call your life journey from Homewood [Pennsylvania] to here?
Speaker 2: (Long pause) Know.  Do.  Be.  Know something.  Do something.  Be something.  That came from--that was an inscription over the auditorium stage of my high school, and I used to think about it sitting in the auditorium study hall every day, wanting to know, do something, and be something.
