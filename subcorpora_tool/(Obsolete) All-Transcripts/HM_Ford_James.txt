Speaker 2: --my mother--
Speaker 1: --name and spelling of it.
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Elvier Brown, E-L-V-I-E-R, B-R-O-W-N.  My father's name was William Benjamin Ford, and you want me to spell all that?

Speaker 1: Sisters or brothers did you have?
Speaker 2: I have one sister Kathryn Robinson.
Story_ID: 55303
Speaker 1: And sir, did your mother [Elvier Brown] ever tell you about her parents, did--her grandparents, her parents?  Did you know anything about them?
Speaker 2: I knew her parents because I lived with my grandfather out on his farm.  And I knew my father's parents because they lived by 5 or ten miles north of my grandfather's farm.  My grandfather's father was constable of Leon County [Florida] many, many years ago.  And they, they--at that particular time, with the family I lived with my grandfather and I could commute by walking through the woods (unclear) listening to the birds and bees from one farm to the other, 'cause if you took the short cut, it was only about a couple miles.
Speaker 1: Now your mother's parents, what were, what were your mother's grandmother and grandfather's names?
Speaker 2: Hallie Reeves (ph.) was my mother's mother name.  William Reeves was her father.
Speaker 1: What type of people were they?
Speaker 2: Well mother was a domestic worker.  She worked for white folk and did the laundry, whatever chores that were necessary at that time to assist.  My father [William Benjamin Ford] worked for Neptune, New Jersey Newspaper and of course he did all the things that the owners--just for run errands, chauffeuring them, whatever was necessary.  That was basically what he did most of his life.
Speaker 1: And what type of people were mother's parents?
Speaker 2: They were farmers, both of my--on my father's side--grandfather were farmers.  And, of course, when they left the farm, seeking greener pastures, my mother still resided in Leon County and my mother's house is next door to where you went to my house, my house today where my sister is presently.  That's my sister's residence, presently.
Story_ID: 55304
Speaker 1: Now you said your great-grandfather, your father's [William Benjamin Ford] grandfather was a constable in Leon County [Florida], he was like a sheriff.  Can you explain any stories like you have about him?
Speaker 2: He was Wild Bill Ford that was his handle.  And as I understand from things he was a pretty starch law enforcement officer in Leon County.  And many, many citizens, white and everybody remember him very well.  I never met him because he died before my time.  But my Aunt Luth-- Louise, my father's sister told us many, many stories about his exploits.  But it seems that he was a very respectable law enforcement officer in Leon County.
Speaker 1: Could you share any of these stories with us?
Speaker 2: Not really because they're too vague for me.  I, I listen to 'em when she was talking and she often talked about, about him because that was her grandfather, you know, and she was very proud.  The part--the Ford side of the family was much more publicly oriented and outgoing and educated than the Reeves side of my family because at that time my Aunt Lou was a school teacher and she taught in Leon County for many, many years.  In fact, we have on Bruno Street now the Ford Mims house and that was her house.  And it is one of the historical places on the Tallahassee [Florida] historical homes and she always enjoyed talking about Ford accomplishments.  So I learned most of what I know about the family on that side from her, listening to her.
Speaker 1: So your family history on the Ford side goes back pretty far, it's pretty--it's documented.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: What types of things public service were you doing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well I originally think the Fords came from Washington D.C. and the Reeves side came from Orangeburg, South Carolina.  That's about, historically, that's about as much as I know about my grandfather [William Reeves] on my mother's [Elvier Brown] side.
Speaker 1: Your father's father and mother, what--
Speaker 2: Were farmers.
Speaker 1: What type of people were they, just any stories, you know, about their grandparents on your father's side?
Speaker 2: Well my grand--my--John Ford was my granddaddy on my father's side and as we talked earlier today about land ownerships, both grandparents owed a reasonable amount of property and they were, they were exclusively farmers.  My grandfather on my mother's side two girls and four boys.  My father on my father's side had two daughters and five sons.  And we were very close, both family were very close and I always enjoyed going to down to my Ford granddaddy's place because Fords Arm owned Lake Jackson [Leon County, Florida] which is a historically lake in Leon County just north of Leon County, that Arm that's down there at the lake down there is named Fords Arm.  And, of course, as a kid I used to walk around the lake, I used to go down there and they had what, at that particular time, was open range.  Open range mean that the cattle, the horses, whatever animals that you had, had free range to go anywhere around the lake.  There were no fences and they could go anywhere they wanted to go and when we used to have round them up and herd them, everybody else's cattle horses were around the lake all intermingle, so you had to know your property.  And it wasn't always easy to cull them out when your, when your grandparents said go down there and take care of those kinds of duties.  It was--that was always kind of stressful because had to be pretty fast.
Story_ID: 55305
Speaker 1: Your mother [Elvier Brown], what type of woman was she?
Speaker 2: My mother was a very, very gentle woman.  She believed in education.  Her early, earlier life wasn't, wasn't in the church as devoted as the last half of her life.  She went to work and she was always attentive to making sure that my sister and I was always following the proper paths.  And she was always very active in, in school activities.  So--she kept up with us as, as far as the education and the teachers were concerned.  We--if something went wrong, let's put it this way, she knew it almost by the time we get home.  I don't know how the lines of communications went out, the telephones or things we had today, but communication back in those days really was not as slow as one today would think it is, with word of mouth passed rapidly.
Speaker 1: Was she a disciplinarian, was she--
Speaker 2: Well, my sister [Kathryn Brown] and I were really never discipline problem kids.  We always knew if she said something that that what the rules were and we pretty well followed them.
Story_ID: 55306
Speaker 1: I had no problem with, with discipline with my grandfather or the rest of the members of the family because--and the community I lived in, when grew up in, everybody in the community in Macon where I grew up as a boy, because I stayed with my granddaddy [William Reeves], any of those people who lived along the roadway could discipline you.  It wasn't one of the situation where if, if you coming from school and you acted up and raising sand and doing anything, that they thought nothing of, of taking care of the situation as it was in front of their property.  And that went for all of the parents who lived in the community.  And as we say today, it takes a community to raise a child.  At that particular time and era that was the way it was.  There was no such thing as the Deacon Taylor in Macon [Florida] and Mr. Gardner who lived along the way.  If you were doing something that wasn't supposed to be done, they could either tell our grandpa when he went to conference and that's to church on Wednesday night.  And, of course, you knew Thursday's morning that what, what the problem was gonna be and you knew exactly what had occurred and you knew exactly what was going to happen.  So it was never one of these things about a lot of promises, they were all always real.  As a result, we fought a little--a few times after we thought we were out of the ear sight, I mean, the ear distance of the neighbors and we'll get it on again, but sometime that didn't work so good because, you know, kids are noisy.  And if any--all that noise we'll keep choosing sides and pushing and urging one side to continue the conflict, we used to have conflict after the school in the evening, we were no angels.  And I'm not trying to portray that, but we always had a problem.
Story_ID: 55307
Speaker 1: What type of man was your father [William Benjamin Ford]?
Speaker 2: I didn't know too much about my father because my father and mother were not married and I--what I do know about him was in the later years we grew to know each other much better, but the earlier years I, I don't know anything other than he worked in New Jersey, lived in New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Did you how your parents met?
Speaker 2: Well like I said, it was only about two miles that separate one farm--one family farm from the other and of course, going to church-to Macon [Florida] church and to Macon school, they would ulti--ultimately meet each other.  So that just like the students going to the neighborhood school, Macon was a neighborhood school for, for where my father lived as well as where my grandfather lived.
Story_ID: 55308
Speaker 1: So what type of child were you?
Speaker 2: Inquisitive, studious, not, not much nonsense, perhaps more an introvert than extrovert.
Speaker 1: What is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memory probably would be crawling under my grandfather's [William Reeves] barn and going--I went under there behind the cat and if you've ever been under a (unclear), a barn that was built with log rails and a regular floor-like, the regular old corn sheds and things were built, the logs laid parallel to the ground and the chickens and the dogs and whatever in the summertime would dig a hole and go under the floor in the barn to keep cool.  The chickens would go under there to lay their eggs and so forth.  Going in is relatively easy, coming out is extremely difficult because you got to come up that slope and get your back over to get out from under there and I could not get out from under the barn.  And this was about probably about 2:00, 3:00 in the evening when I went in there and it was probably 6:00 or 6:30 and it was getting dark and I could not get out.  So that has lingered in my memory pretty well.
Speaker 1: How did you finally get out?
Speaker 2: I finally kept digging and doing until I got out.  I hollered until I was frantic and everything and nobody came and I finally squeezed myself out from under there.  But it was not--it was very traumatic experience.
Story_ID: 55309
Speaker 1: You grew up on a farm, tell us about the responsibilities you had on the farm there as a child.
Speaker 2: Basically we had to get up in the morning, feed the horses, we had several horses, we had lots of cows, we had milked cows and we had lots of hogs and chickens.  It was my responsibility morning and evening to make sure they were feed, along with my uncles and other members.  And along with them it was also my responsibility and their responsibilities to make sure that there was adequate fire wood chopped and in the yard in the woodshed for use when it rained and for heating and cooking.  The stove we used at that time was a wood stove, so you had to have a lot of wood and you had to have it dry, a method to keeping it dry, and you had to have a good supply and along with that you had to have kindling that we called "light wood."  And we--you get that my digging up pine stumps that that had decayed to the point that the rosin in them had created fat lighter and that was used to raise the temperature of your other wood to the point that it would burn.  So--and their responsibility of making sure that they adequate water and we had two boiling springs.  We were fortunate 'cause we had one on our property and it was only about two blocks away and we had another one on the adjoining property to us that was about four blocks away.  And it depended on what time of day it was which one you would decide to use, not, not necessarily the closest one.  Because around these springs in the summertime, because deer and many other animals and everything went there to drink water, it was a general watering hole for all of the animals.  So it was not usual for moccasin snakes to be right coiled in the vegetations and ferns around the spring.  And obviously we didn't go to get water after certain daylight, you know, but those are just a few of the things that I had to do.
Story_ID: 55310
Speaker 1: And, of course, you had to study your lesson and be ready for school the next day.  And one of the things that I perhaps dislike the most, it was a custom back in that time, unlike today, to get all of the grass out from around the house.  Around the house then we use to take straw that grew in the field, regular broom sage we called it, but it's a straw that gray--they had brown straw you see in a lot of fields and wrap it and make brooms to sweep the yards nice and clean.  It, it was one of those things like ritual, you spent a lot of Saturdays cleaning all that trash, debris, leaves or whatever got in the yard, sweeping it away with those brooms.  And it was a reason why the yard was always kept out in rural areas like that, sweep cleaned, because you could see snakes and any other kinds of things that was out there at night or any other times.  So that--it was not just by accident that the grass for a reasonable distance around the house, there were not grass.  Flowers would be planted, johnny quills and other kinds of flowers, but that was one of the chores that I didn't particularly like.  And that had to happen before we could play baseball or whatever we was gonna play on Saturday evenings.  We had little leagues within our community and other communities where we would play on Saturdays evenings.  We would only had baseball diamonds.  And, of course, we all had those little hoops off of barrels and things on both side of the tree where we played basketball, but that's, that's about the way it was at that time.
Story_ID: 55311
Speaker 1: Now you were explaining earlier, you made a comment that there was a lot of land owned not just your father's [William Benjamin Ford] parents but your mother's [Elvier Brown] parents, that there was a lot of land.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Tell us how that community was, was that land system and how they acquired that land?
Speaker 2: When I was born, they already, already had the land.  The land acquisition from the Reeves family, my mother's side.  There was a black man name Mr. Macon, Elliot Macon, who had very large track of land.  He acquired--how he acquired I can't answer that, but you know, land at that time was a $1.00 an acre, 50 cent an acre, all kinds of prices, very cheap.  But any way, my granddaddy [Willian Reeves] acquired 50 acres from him that he used for his farm and there was about 150 acres through the down meridian road that my grandfather on the Ford side [Bill Ford] owned.  And I don't know how the black land owners in Leon County [Florida] acquired the properties that they had but they would have to have been able to get that property from plantation owners in Leon County in South Georgia.  They--much of the land that you would find along many of thoroughfares in Leon County was previously owned by blacks who lost that land through tax deeds, neglecting to pay their property taxes.  And there's a lot of reasons why this occurred. First of all a farmer's income is not guaranteed.  And as they grew older and as things occurred and as their children migrated north, they lacked the financial resources to pay the taxes on it.  And, of course, much of it was sold because of tax liens.
Speaker 1: What, what I do want to know about this neighborhood was how many homes?  Was it like one house and a large track of land then another house and a large track of land or--explain how that community was?
Speaker 2: Around where the school and the road was--let's say that there was a couple blocks between houses.  And many of them were miles.  My grandfather on the Ford side [John Ford], there were many miles in between one house and the next house.  On my mother's side, there was probably two to three blocks between the houses.  That's, that's about the population the way it was and like you said, that--because of the different land owners and farm land in between, the house was probably the furthest thing--the closest things to the road that went through the community.  And we had--roads followed where the property owners was, it had no rhyme or reason of how many curves that it took.  Trying to run a straight road wasn't the objective.  It was the shortest distance to get between one person's house and the others.  And at that particular time too, freedom to roam is something that kids today can't do that we--the ability to do.  There were no restrictions on taking the short cut across any neighbor's property.  The kids--all kids--well everybody knew everybody and it was never--we never had that kind of problem.  There was not conflict between land owners.
Story_ID: 54837
Speaker 1: Okay sir, I'll like you to tell us about your schooling, beginning with your elementary school in Tallahassee [Florida].
Speaker 2: I lived about six blocks from school [Macon Elementary school] where my grandfather's [William Reeves] house, of course, and it was, at first a one room schoolhouse and the schoolhouse was donated to the community by the plantation owner.  Many of the schools in Leon County [Florida] at that particular time that were black schools were named for either plantation owners or were donated one way or the other.  The county invested very little money in schools at many of these areas for blacks.  The county did have some money invested in Macon [Elementary] school and some of the other schools.  But it was minimum when you start thinking about what schooling was really like at that time.  The text books we would get were text books were hand-me-down.  Many times half of text was mutilated or pages would be missing or it was written--the book had written up all on the covers and everywhere else.  In other words, I don't recall ever having in elementary school a new text book.  And they had two teachers when I was going to school and the school went to the eighth grade at that time, no, no, sixth grade at that time.  And for lunch, we had no lunchrooms and no, no lunch situation until, I don't know what years that started, but then it started when they start having government subsidized food.  When they had a lot of cans of canned beef that they would send out.  Cases of canned beef or stuff like that, that the teachers could make soup or something else to subsidize the fact that many of the kids didn't really have anything to eat when they came to school.  They, they brought whatever they had from home in their little pails and lunch boxes and set them back in the cloak room.  Sometime somebody would raise, would raid (laughter), raid your lunch pail and you'll find out that you didn't have any lunch, but basically the rules of school at that time had the same kind of pot belly stoves that I've told you about and we had to the students had to collect the wood or the parents would haul wood to keep the stove and the heat going during the winter part of the time.  And, of course, always, there was no running water, so you always had to go to these same boiling springs that I would tell you about.  And they were few and far in between.  So our boiling spring also served the supply water for the school.
Story_ID: 54838
Speaker 1: The community is a very-- was a very close-knit community and there's two churches and a lodge in the community.  The lodge was right next to the school.  And later the lodge turned out to be one of the classrooms for the school in later years.  The two churches approximately two blocks apart, one is a Missionary Baptist that my grandfather [William Reeves] on my mother's side was a deacon in the church.  The other was a Primitive Baptist church that Mr. [Elliot] Macon, who was a major land owner, donated the land for the church and, and that was the Primitive Baptist church in Macon.  So the school and the church bore his name.
Story_ID: 54839
Speaker 1: Now while you're either in this community [Macon in Leon County, Florida] or in your elementary school [Macon Elementary School], are there any people really have any influence upon you or act as a mentor or you look at them and you look up to them and admire them in the community or in the school, your elementary school?
Speaker 2: At the elementary school?  (laughter)  There was some black families who worked on the plantation and who run the plant--supervisor and run the plantation like (unclear) plantation, the Snead family who are cousins of mine incidentally, because my grandmother on my father's [William Benjamin Ford] side, well my father's mother was a Snead.  Anyway they, they were a little more well off than most of the citizens in the community and they had more resources though, they were meager, to add to the community's wealth they like the church enlarge and various other things to support and they--the other things that they kinds of physical things that they could do because they had access to the community, I mean, to the plantations facilities and equipment.  My teachers were not necessarily my great mentors.  I guess because my experiences, one was my Aunt Lou and I thought that she was harder on me than she was anybody else and I recognized she wanted me to be a success or whatever all that stuff is.  But it appeared to me that she was always punishing me unnecessarily so she wasn't on my favorite list to say the least and but the lady that worked with her, I was not in the grades that she taught at school at that time.
Speaker 1: Now the Snead family, you said you looked up to them or look up--(unclear)(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well they had kids my age and they had a whole series of them, probably six or seven daughters, five or six sons.  We played together and generally they felt that they were a little bit better than we were, when you think about the hierarchy ranking in the community, if there's still such a thing, they would have been the people who would have been the well-to-do, if you use that term.
Story_ID: 54840
Speaker 1: Church and school [Macon Elementary School] relationships I can remember several things that the schools always had a May Day exercise, where you played, flag day, maypole, did Scottish dances and a whole lot of other stuff that have May Days and all schools had May Days when I was growing up, even when I went to secondary school they still had May Days.  But, I guess the thing that I really enjoyed about going to school was recess.  At recess, and recess last an hour unlike school (laughter). In that hour it plenty time for me to go back home and get back to school in time because as I told you it was only about two or three blocks away.  So that--I could always go home and there was always plenty sweet potatoes, syrup, buttered bread, stuff like that because I guess when you think of the community on the other spectrum, my granddaddy [William Reeves] probably would have been the next wealthy to do that we didn't have everything.  We have never not had an abundance of agriculture products like year round ham and meat in the smoke house and barrels of syrup in the smoke house, corn for grinding meal and all the type of vegetables if you wanna have--I never have been hungry and I never had to worry about food, but clothes-- Christmastime we would get a pair of tennis shoes and probably a pair of dress shoes, some oranges, five crackers, cap pistol, caps and nuts, fruits and nuts.  And I always got this big ole cane, no it wasn't a cane it was just a big round bar of peppermint candy, you know, the huge ones and, of course, that was a real bargaining chip 'cause you could go around and get a lot of help (laughter) sharing your peppermint stick.
Story_ID: 54841
Speaker 1: Now what was your church?  What was the church community like?
Speaker 2: Oh the church community was really tight-knit, depend--it didn't make much difference whether you were a Primitive Baptist or the Missionary Baptist, the only difference--they differentiated the two with us at that time was the Primitive Baptist washed feet and the Missionary Baptist didn't.  But other than that there weren't a nickel worth of difference in their services or the people and the people would go to each other's churches so it wasn't, it wasn't really a clannish thing at all.  I guess the thing about the church at that time, in the rural community they had these wooden pews made out of pine, very straight backs, very uncomfortable and parents back in those days were very strict about the kids going to Sunday school and going to church and going to B.Y.P.U. [Baptist Young Peoples Union].  Now that ate up your Sunday.  When you had to go to B.Y.P.U. before the night evening church service 'cause you couldn't play softball.  And obviously I don't need to tell you that wasn't the most favorite thing for the younger group because--especially the first Sunday, that was the Sunday that the rotating--no the roaving preacher came around the circuit, like they were second riding judges, the preacher would come on the second--the first Sunday, one church second Sunday another, they not the same preacher now, but that was the sequence of how the churches operated.  They did not have a permanent preacher--churches didn't have the permanent preacher who, who stayed right at that church and did all of his preaching, he preached and was the pastor at several churches, but he had a Sunday for which his duties at that church were required.  But we had to go to Sunday school every Sunday morning and as you, as you got in high school and those kinds of things, you end up having to be a Sunday school teacher which meant now you had to kinda review what you was going to do Saturday because you had to teach it Sunday morning and those kinda task pretty much ironed out a lot of the social life that you would normally have.
Story_ID: 54842
Speaker 1: The social life in the community like that gets to be little.  Aside from having a baseball game or horseshoes or having a basket feast and a basket feast is something that--there's two, three things we used to always like in the community, cane grindings, basket feast and harvesting the peanuts.  Those particular things always, though they were labor intense, they were the kinds of things that every family in the community who farmed would assistance the other family in harvesting their crops or whatever they had to do.  When it time to make cane juice and into syrup or to grind the cane, the kids could stay up later because in grinding and cooking off the syrup from having ground the juice from the cane, always lasted late at night--later in the night and the kids had more time to roam around and it also meant more time for the boys to play with the girls because it was dark and we stayed around, we could stay up until the adults shut down and cooked off the syrup for the night and sometimes that would last until about ten o'clock otherwise you were suppose to bed almost like people use to say, with the chickens.  When sundown, that was another written law, when the sundown came you were suppose to be home.  So we didn't have anybody loitering after dark.
Story_ID: 54843
Speaker 1: Sir, may I ask you question, what's sights, sounds and smells reminds you of your childhood there in Macon, Leon County, Tallahassee [Florida] area.
Speaker 2: Flowers, like cherokee rose blossoms, honeysuckle vines, even when you were coming here.  The wisteria and the honeysuckle smell is along that roadway if you, if you know what those smells are.  Instead of orange blossoms like you smell down where you are, you would get those kinds of smells and then if you were looking at it from another point of view at the various times of year, you could identify anybody who's cooking off cane syrup anywhere.  That has a very distinctive, pleasant smell.
Story_ID: 54844
Speaker 1: The sounds, one of the sounds, well I would take, go back a little bit that--what probably determined what my career would be happen in 1935.  In 1935 was the first time I had ever heard a radio and the radio belonged to an insurance man who came in the evening he came to collect his 10, 15 cents for the insurance that grandpa [William Reeves] had, you know, for the members of the family and so forth and so on.  But at that particular era in broadcast stations everything was AM, number one, and it was extremely few broadcast stations in the county.  WLAC, the station in Chicago [Illinois], the station WLW, I believe in New Orleans [Louisiana] and WSM in Nashville [Tennessee].  Well WSM in Nashville is the station that was more prevalent at that time, but I was so fascinated and carried away with how this could occur until I spent most of my--a lot of my other time when I was going to school and everything in radio and electronics.  And that's really my major, not school administration.  I'm a vocational major.  But I would even tell you the song that was playing on the radio was "Buffalo Gals" and "We're Gonna Raise Ruckus Tonight".  And that was in 1935 Ford Coupe, I remember that very distinctive like it was yesterday.
Story_ID: 54845
Speaker 1: So that really made you interested in--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --(unclear)(simultaneous--
Speaker 2: I was fascinated.  In fact, as you, as you probably know, I was a manager of WFANM [WAMN] radio in Tallahassee [Florida] for a while and that's black radio station that was right down there on Tennessee Street.
Speaker 1: Did your grandparents or mother ever get a radio or have one?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, we, we graduated up to radio during Joe Louis' reign as a boxer 'cause they had--there were two kinds radios then that rural people had.  They didn't have electricity, so they had to buy this huge battery that was 1-1/2 volt, 90 volt B battery, it ran your radios during that period of time.  And they had a life expectancy on how you played them just like your flashlight, because that's all it was, was a series of flashlight batteries hooked together.  And, of course, you didn't listen--you listen to the radio selectively you didn't listen to the radio like we listen to radio today.  The radio played when there was going to be some particular incident like Joe Louis was gonna fight and that was the most popular of all.  Everybody in the neighborhood who didn't have a radio, we had a big party that night listening to Joe Louis fight.  There were many times walking by us when the battery wasn't there or to come to listen to Joe Louis say, "I'm glad I won."  So that was one of the, one of the things that had a great impact on me.

Speaker 1: Ask you about your high school, tell me about your high school experiences.  The teachers there, your high school--(unclear)(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh my high school experiences probably would be the similar to those of any kid who went from a rural community to an urban school.  First of all inferiority complex.  I had to walk about five miles to get to school and as strange as it might seem to people, if you would check my attendance rate at Lincoln High School at that time, I believe I missed 10 days going to school during my high school career.  And yet I had to walk from where I lived through Fremont Street all from where my grandfather's [William Reeves] farm is on I-10 to the school.  Because my parents and my granddaddy was staunch believers in education and didn't matter to them about rain or shine, you didn't stay home because it rain, that didn't mean a thing.  You worked in the rain when you farmed and when you got the other stuff raining in the evening, you had your chores do.  And unless there was some terrific thunderstorm or something mighty bad, it really didn't, didn't make any difference.  And I guess after--as a result of that, I'm not deterred because the weather gets bad or, or something because I learned to live with those kinds of experiences.  So if it's thundering and lightening, I respect that, the lightening and all of that, but I also know something about what lightening and how lightening reacts, where not to be.

Speaker 1: Now at Leon High School--
Speaker 2: Lincoln.
Speaker 1: Lincoln High School [in Tallahassee, Florida], were there any teachers or anyone who guided you, mentored you while you were there?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  Now you've gotten into the area where I can talk about mentors.  When I first went to Lincoln High School, as fate would have it, I was in the seventh grade and all of the kids just about along the road who went to school to Lincoln, after a while, there was nobody but me who was at that grade level to have to walk to Lincoln.  They were still in sixth grade and at Macon.  But the school burned down at Lincoln and subsequently they built another school, brick, the first one was wood, and it burned down just about a month before time for me to go to school to Lincoln.  So they had to run double sessions and as fate would have it, my session started around noon and lasted until about 6:00 in the evening.  And I don't--we didn't have what is known as daylight savings time, that's a newcomer to the scene, which meant when I got out of school at every night, that evening, it was night.  And I had that walking trek back home.  But that's the way life was.  Now some of the mentors that I had in high school that I had a great deal of respect for was a lady name Mrs. Henrietta Williams.  Mrs. Williams was the kindest, gentlest, soft spoken lady that you want to meet.  An intense interest in her students and an excellent disciplinarian.  She never raised her voice, but you knew she meant business none the less so you didn't raise hell in the class.  But the reason she is important to me is I was having problems doing mathematics, especially fractions.  And one afternoon she told me to stay later after class went.  She explained to me what math was all about, what the relationship of what fractions and multiplication, division and all that stuff was.  And I never had to this day any more problems with Arithmetic.  She took the time, she recognized and took that interest in me when nobody else all the way through did, that's one teacher.
Story_ID: 54848
Speaker 1: Then my Vocational Ag. [agriculture] teacher, George Henry Brown, who taught me basically, I knew a great deal about growing crops and vegetables and everything, but he taught me the mechanical side, the mechanized agriculture thing like using tractors and various other kinds of stuff in the process.  And we'll go to NFA meetings and if you're familiar with agricultural organizations and in high school at that time, there was NFA [New Farmers of America] and FFA [Future Farmers of America] in the State of Florida.  And, of course, we went to conferences to various places.  That meant we got to travel and, of course, obviously any kid likes his mentor who takes him places and he sees new things and experiences so he had an impact.  And he was an ardent lover fisherman, of fishing, and obviously like I told you for years my, my great-grandfather [Bill Ford] in the family owned their owned Fords Arms on Lake Jackson [Florida] so that was a natural.  I knew the lake, I knew, you know, all that kind of stuff.  We had a good thing going on in that respect.  And then the principal of the school, Dr. Gilbert, Dr. Gilbert Porter, who recently passed about 4 or 5 years ago [1995], was principal at the school at that time.  And he took an interest in me and he would let me and some other kids go back to the science lab after hours in the evening and study and experiment, if we wanted to, and of course, this was a great asset to us, we had the run of the lab 'til about 8:30 at night.  So that--he had a good sense of humor and an intense interest in you succeeding.  So I would put him high on my list of people who had, had a very positive influence on my life.
Story_ID: 55312
Speaker 1: Okay Mr. Ford, you're a senior in high school [Lincoln High School in Tallahassee, Florida], you're about to graduate, what are your thoughts about what you're going to do next?
Speaker 2: I had no thoughts about what I was gonna do next when I graduated from Lincoln High School, not really.  Because when I graduated from Lincoln High School, prior to graduating from Lincoln High School, World War II broke out and [President] Franklin Roosevelt gave his speech that we were going to--that we were in war and all of that kind of stuff with the Japanese [1941].  And at that particular time they needed people, they needed people to help build ships and all the other goodies and we--about six of us boys made up in our minds--we had heard that Sun Ship [Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Co. in Chester, Pennsylvania] that they were hiring people to do, to do sheet metal work.  I'm a little ahead myself.  Prior to, graduating from school, Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University in Tallahassee, Florida] offered defense training classing in trades electricity.  We all in sheet metals, you name it, all the things that would go in National Defense Trades.  So we were excused earlier in the day to go to A&M and take up which ever one of those courses that we wanted to take, they were free to us.  So we got credit for the time, school credit and everything, but we went to these trade courses so when we graduated we had also finished the requirements in those courses and trades.  We were proficient let's say, no, no, not perfect but skilled to a certain extent in the trades of sheet metal for the class.  And the members of the class that was in sheet metal, we decided that we would go to Pennsylvania to Sun Ship and work in the defense.  And, of course, we took off with meager funds in our pocket.  Obviously, we ain't got no money, just getting out of school and we knew we had no scholarships and it would have been a very near, very near impossible thing for me to gone to college anyway 'cause my mother didn't have that kind of funds to send me.  And we went to Pennsylvania to apply for the jobs.  We went down and filled out all the applications and we got on down there and we find out that you had to be a certain age to be employed.  Well I and about two more of the classmates were under age, we needed another year.  So we arbitrarily tacked on another year and went on to work.
Story_ID: 55313
Speaker 1: Things went fine until I came back to-- I came back to Tallahassee [Florida] and did not return back after a couple weeks after the Christmas season, when I should've been going back to work.  Well there's another little interested thing about what happen.  Stanley Black, the man we were rooming with in Chester, Pennsylvania was happen also be the Chairman of the Draft Board in Pennsylvania.  Well I didn't return back to his house after the Christmas break, so now I'm eligible to be drafted.  And, of course, that's what occurred.  I got all this stuff from Pennsylvania to be drafted in Pennsylvania in about three or weeks of interaction between the draft board and Tallahassee and Pennsylvania to get it transferred back to Leon County [Florida] draft board.  Well obviously I had put my age up in Pennsylvania.  Well obviously I ain't old enough in Leon County (laughter) to be drafted.  So now I got a slight dilemma.  So rather than to divulge the fact, and informed the Leon County people that I wasn't eligible to be drafted yet.  I went on and was drafted and, of course, like every draftee, you get called up and they send you off.  They sent me to Camp Blanding and at Camp Blanding they sorted you out where you gonna go, where they were gonna ship you and what branch of service you were gonna be in.  So they put me in the [United States] Navy as a steward mate sent to Maryland, Bainbridge, Maryland that was Steward Mate Training Center.  And at that time in the Navy, very few black seaman who went--who were getting into the Navy, most blacks were trained in schoolmates--steward mate school to wait on the officers aboard the ship and so forth and carry out the housekeeping chores, so I was drafted and went to Bainbridge, Maryland from basic training and then was sent from Bainbridge, Maryland to the U.S.S. Gage [attack transport].  When I was aboard U.S.S. Gage, I was assigned as a Captain's Steward Mate.  And that was basically my duty throughout my Navy career.  I ended up from Steward Mate to First Class Steward in the Navy.
Story_ID: 55314
Speaker 1: Now how were your experiences as a black man in the military [United States Navy] in the '40's [1940s], still a segregated military, how was that?
Speaker 2: Well it would not have been very good had I not been the Captain's Steward [on the USS Gage].  Having been the Captain's Steward I had full range of the ship.  I did not have the same rules and regulations as it related to leave, as related to access to whatever I need and wanted to do.  Because I was the Skipper's Steward, I did not experience having some of the other problems that as--that you have in general mess or the stewards and officer quarters or otherwise.
Speaker 1: What were some of the problems that existed for those who weren't fortunate as you were?
Speaker 2: Well, for instance, it became import--this would be a classical one, unless the Skipper decided to stay aboard, I had all the time that I could go ashore.  And I could go ashore anytime there were any vehicle from the ship going to shore and I could come back anytime I wanted to that vehicle or boat was coming back to the ship.  I was not relegated to have and to wait until 11:00 or 12:00 or whatever it is for something to occur or for when my leave would begin or end to that extent.  If he was going to stay aboard, I had no leave.  If it was not--I had all the leave (laughter) the leave because I had no real duties to do.  So there were certain advantages.  And then I had to also the advantage of not having--I could bring anything aboard that I wanted to and, of course, I had to bring a lot of things to the Executive Officer and everybody else I got to have--a lot of it I got to be courier for bringing their booze and stuff that they wanted to get back aboard ship. You know, all those things occurred.  We had certain advantages.
Speaker 1: So it seem you're enjoying the military?
Speaker 2: Oh I had no problem with it.  I stayed sick for the first month and after that and after I got my sea legs, every rain, shine, storm, I didn't care.  But the first month I spent, I prayed to die.  And in the first time the ship went out from Bremerton, Washington out, it was Thanksgiving Day and 90 per cent officers and the crew were sea sick.  And the storm, it had stormed and lighting, it had the worse--the fan tail and the propeller on the ship would come out and shake it and you could feel all of it the rivets in the ships and the seams wondering if it was going to fall apart 'cause it would come up and shake and the bow would come and all that water when it would come back up, would come back up across the top of the ship, decks.  And all of us were sick and water was running all over your pants and your shoes 'cause you had to go up and get some fresh air.  You couldn't possibly stay downstairs.  Imagine trying get that--the crew of a ship up on deck.  It was miserable.
Speaker 1: So you did enjoy being in the Navy?
Speaker 2: I enjoyed the Navy fine.  I enjoyed the Navy better than I did the Army because I had all the comforts when I was in the Navy.  And as I told you about my Army experiences, though I was a Commission Officer, First Lieutenant, I was living primitive in steward.
Story_ID: 55315
Speaker 1: So the war [World War II], you leave the [United States Navy] Navy and what do you do next?  What do you think on embarking on next?
Speaker 2: After I got out of the Navy I went to ROTC [Reserve Officer's Training Corps] at the University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University in Tallahassee, Florida], because that was how now I can get an education because as a veteran you can go to school.  And I took advantage of that  And because I had been prior--I had prior service, there were only two years of ROTC when I came to A&M we had to take because of previous military service at that time we had.  And, of course, I was commissioned in 1950 as Second Lieutenant [for the United States Army] and about six months after that I was called to active duty and shipped to Fort Stewart [Georgia] where training center after training center I got pushed back.  I started off with 77th then transferred to the 35th and then a new group came in and I was transferred to all these different battalions.  One battalion was sent to Fort Totten, New York [New York City, New York], another one was sent to California.  And all of these were nice places for duty but each time I got letters transferring me back to post after the training ended for each of these battalions.  So it got to the  point that after I gone through the third on and couldn't get shipped out of Stewart, I found this little caveat in Army Regulations that if you served 24 months, you could get out.  My wife [Clinita Arnsby] didn't want me to do this, but I had--I was-- I would have stayed in and re-upped had I not been in Stewart and been transferred three times back to post.  I got tired of summer and winter out there on the range with a bunch of folk who didn't want to qualify.
Story_ID: 55316
Speaker 1: Going back to your FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University in Tallahassee, Florida] days, you enter into FAMU, what are your thoughts on what you're going to major in, what you're going to do any of these things when you first got there on the campus?
Speaker 2: Well I knew that I was going to take the electronic courses because here again I told you about the experiences as a kid. And I felt now was an opportunity for me to learn something about transmitters and basically all the radio theory.  So enrolled in those classes and at that particular time at the University there was a requirement in your vocational education curriculum that you take all of the trades, you had to take brick masonry, you had to take electricity, you had to take carpentry, auto mechanics.  That was part of the curriculum that you had to take and finish before you could graduate from--with a vocational degree.  That's why all the things in this building and the things that you see me do I do them very well because I'm pretty good at doing them, that's part of the training.
Story_ID: 55317
Speaker 1: So what type of experiences where you having while you were there?  Socially, what was going on?
Speaker 2: Well, at A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University in Tallahassee, Florida]?
Speaker 1: Or in the City of Tallahassee [Florida], both place.
Speaker 2: In the City of Tallahassee prior to-- I was a pretty bashful guy when I was in high school [Lincoln High School], when it came time for the junior, senior prom, I hadn't learn to dance good so I got a--one young lady taught me how to dance good enough to go to the prom.  But the girls, I use to be really shy of girls, they use to run me--get behind me and run me through the hole in the cemetery fence that would go 'cause school is right beside cemetery.  Got a chain-link in fence and the students had cut a hole in the fence, the chain-link 'cause that was the short cut.  So they would run me to this opening when they felt like--they would--what they would do there would be three or four of them chasing me and being a country boy, I didn't know how to handle this sudden change.  And this continue for about two years off and on.  I was kinda bashful and felt insecure because the boys who were in town had jobs at the hotel and other places and they had the zoot suits and all other kind of clothes and I didn't have and couldn't afford all that stuff and even if I did, by the time I walked to school in them, they would've looked like hell.  So I was a misfit as far as-- emotionally I felt and otherwise, so in that respect my social life as it related to the school, to the extent was limited.  So I spent, I guess, more of my time becoming more intellectual involved.
Speaker 1: Now you're saying--was it like this while you was at FAMU also?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: What was it like when you were at FAMU?
Speaker 2: When I went to FAMU I came back as a veteran [of the United States Navy] and I had all these others experiences in, in Japan, in the Philippines, all over the Pacific.  And as a result of that I didn't have social fear, I didn't have an, being the Captain's Steward I had no emotional anything.
Speaker 1: So the Navy given you some reassurance about--
Speaker 2: Oh I felt totally competent, obviously from being a non-commissioned officer in the Navy.  You didn't have any complexes, inferiority complexes or other things about leadership.  For that matter abilities so that, that was not a problem.
Story_ID: 55318
Speaker 1: Are there any specific experiences while you were in the [United States] Navy that gave you these feelings of reassurance or leadership that you can speak about, any stories?
Speaker 2: I guess, I guess you could say because I was the Captain Steward and all the other Officers, especially the Executive Officer had to come in and see every day and brief the Captain on what was going on and take his orders, that I was there and a part of it.  And before the Exec would knock on the door to go in to see the Captain, they would ask me what the mood of the Captain was try to pick me for all kind of information and a lot of times he was trying to pick me for secret information that he felt that I knew would divulge like where the ship was going, like when we expected to arrive, like that, a whole lot of those things.  A lot of that data I had access and knew, but I never violated the trust to the Captain and the Captain may have may have been had all this stuff implore to find out whether I would.  But they never broke me nor did I violate any of those trust because I recognized that they weren't suppose to know, so they weren't suppose to know.  And because here again, though they were the commissioned officers, when they came up on my deck it didn't matter to me whether they were commissioned officers that much, not because I did not feel the same subservience that I would felt on any other deck or any other--had been in any other position.  Because none of 'em-- would not been guilty of rubbing me the wrong way.  Because they had no way of knowing what the repercussions could end of being.
Speaker 1: So they had-they, they were--(unclear)(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, there was a certain amount of fear to say the least, there was.
Story_ID: 55319
Speaker 1: So while you were at FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University in Tallahassee, Florida] in the ROTC [Reserve Officer's Training Corps], how does this [his previous experience in the United States Navy] help you while you're in that situation in the ROTC?
Speaker 2: Well you felt, you were in there, most of the people in the ROTC for the first two years had served in some branch of the service and everybody in there felt kinda independent or special no matter which branch you represented.  We were not cadets, we were cadets, but we were not at the lowest echelon or starting off.  We had certain experiences, all of us and we didn't act like we were beginners.  And didn't feel threaten by anybody.  My experiences, I've been all over the Pacific, I've been all over Sea posts on the West Coast.  I didn't have any reason to feel threaten by other experiences or anything.  I felt quite comfortable.
Speaker 1: Now while you at FAMU, do you pick up on any mentors here as you did with Dr. Porter in high school?  Did you see any--did you meet any people or come in contact with those say gave you guidance or advice or had special relationship with?
Speaker 2: Most of that happen to me basically in graduate school then undergraduate school of the mentoring, because you stayed such a short time with a person, on a graduate level, you probably took one course for a semester and then you didn't have any interaction with that person or that professor afterwards.
Story_ID: 55320
Speaker 1: So you're nearing graduation [from Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University in Tallahassee, Florida], what do you foreseeing yourself doing?
Speaker 2: When I was ending graduation, I really hadn't given that a hear a gain which thought as I told you earlier, having been in the service before graduation and going into school--I hadn't seriously thought about what, what I was going to do too much.  I just wanted to get out and have the freedom of having finish the education.  And I guess I did a lot of that for moma [Elvier Brown] 'cause she wanted me to get an education.  She wanted me to be something she could be proud of and I wanted her to be proud and as a result I stuck it out.
Story_ID: 55321
Speaker 1: So after graduation where do you go?
Speaker 2: After graduation I started telling you about Dr. [Gilbert] Porter enters into the picture.
Speaker 1: Tell us that story.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Dr. Porter was my high school principal.  He was also the President of FSTA which is the black version of the Florida State Teacher Association and the white was FEA, Florida Education Associates.  But there used to be two associations, educational associations, which later merged.  When Dr. Porter saw me and offered me a job teaching at Lincoln High School [in Tallahassee, Florida] and also telling me that I could go and get prepared for that job, 'cause they were introducing Driver's Ed. at the school this particular year so I went that summer at A&M and got certified to teach Driver's Ed., and he said I was the first Driver's Ed. Teacher in Leon County [Florida].
Speaker 1: So this is the beginning of the education?
Speaker 2: That's the beginning of the education career.  I worked, I worked there teaching science and math for several years, I don't know how long necessarily in these particular cases.  And then the vocational department at Lincoln High School was expanding, the course offering were expanding, they offered electricity as one of those courses in the Vocational Ed. Department at the high school.  And, of course, I taught that and they wanted to increase the electrical curriculum into electronics so I taught both of those for several years.
Speaker 1: Now education was not something you were actually interested in before hand, before--
Speaker 2: I have then and have now no real educational desires.  They--things that occurred, they were opportunities that presented themselves and I simply took advantage of the opportunities as they presented themselves.  I did not go out and seek any of other 'em or the transfers or the appointments from one position to the other.  That's what I was telling you in the beginning.  I never--I don't' have any solicitation skills.
Speaker 1: So your first experience teaching, when you get in the classroom you have these students, what's it like?
Speaker 2: In the classroom in '51' [1951], the students' behavior was totally different from today's student behavior.  They were really no serious problems in controlling the class.  You were the teacher, it was understood that, you made that very clear.  You laid down what the rules and regulations for the conduct of the class were gonna be.  They were told what quality of work they were gonna have to do in order to get out.  All of this was explained up front and so that it would be no misunderstanding at the end.  This is the way the grading would be done, this is the information you're expected to know, now it's up to you.
Story_ID: 55343
Speaker 1: Now sir, you're been a teacher since 1950, you've been an educator, you've been rather successful.  Now the time comes where school integration is occurring throughout the south and areas, tell us about the role you played in that area?
Speaker 2: After leaving Lincoln High School [Tallahassee, Florida] the superintendent had offered me a rural school in Miccosukee community, that's in the northeast part of Leon County [Florida].  The school is Concord School.  When I first went out at the school, took a one good look at the school, the school was about 20 miles out of town and I, this was on a Friday and I was supposed to tell the superintendent that Monday whether or not I wanted to accept the principalship, I went out and looked at and decided at first the answer would no, that I preferred not being transferred unless I had to take it.  But by Monday morning I thought about the potential that the school had and I envisioned what I could do in that school and the community the change the lives of a lot of folk and I took it own as a challenge.  So I accepted that position at the school.  After beginning there 3 or 4 years, the opportunity came to hire two new teachers.  As people retired, as people were able to transfer from school to another, it was a policy that when openings would occur at some of the city's schools that rural teachers could fill, would have first crack at filling those position at city school because they've been driving these miles and things for a long time and there was a little difference in pay because of the length of the school year for the city or the rural school.  These two vacancies came up and, of course, these two white teachers, female teachers' applications were in the court house with all their credentials and of course I had the positions and they knew that I had the position so they contacted me for an interview and I graciously gave the interview and I graciously agreed to hire 'em.  This was not one of those things that was, was known necessarily county wide or county at all.  Superintendent gave approval to the hiring, they worked at the school, they worked at the school separately as before.  Any knowledge otherwise in the-- among the other principals and so forth about the situation because in the rural setting at that time, we had itinerant people who would come in a teach speech, we had a speech therapist, a P.E. [physical education] person, language people, we had all kinds of folk who would come in and spend "X" amount of hours a week in the school.  So it would not have been just visually looking an unusual situation for a person of color to be in the school.  So we really had no problems with that.  They worked well, they rode to and from school with the other teachers from town in order to make it an economical space.  In fact, just last year, one of them came back from the City of Tallahassee [Florida], I mean to the City of Tallahassee looked me up and we had a long conversation about she wanted to know about all the people that were out of the community, where the other old teachers were.  And it was just like old times.
Story_ID: 55344
Speaker 1: So the integration, was there ever a problem that you saw as an educator with integration happening?  Were there any complication or difficulties that you, you experienced?
Speaker 2: Yes, from this standpoint, I didn't experience those things as in the working relationship realm because one thing, which goes back to my personality, I'm not one of the kind of person that really had a whole lot of problems with white folk because I grew up with them as neighbors and I played with neighbors and they cared--even when my kids, when they went to school, and when springtime Tallahassee and other things, it was the white mothers that would pick 'em up from school and bring them home.  So I had had excellent race relationship kinds of experience.  So obviously my perspective would probably be slightly different from somebody else's because of the interactions that I've had, from childhood too.  The problems that I saw with the integration process basically dealt with transportation issues, faculties issues, economical issues of dollars spent in rural black schools and so forth and now the integration prob--when it began occurring the attrition of black teachers the upsetting-- uprooting rather students from neighborhood schools into a totally white integrated system where they no longer can be the May Day Queen, they can no longer be the football quarterback or various other things at the beginning, because only one at that school that happen when you're integrating at that particular time we had about eight or nine  black schools in the process and to integrate all these kids into the situation meant that they lost their identity and it's the identity thing that I think was detrimental as I looked at it.  Like when the kids came from school that I had to Leon [High School], the coaches were not going to make them the cheerleaders and varies other things like they would of have the same opportunities in their school settings.
Story_ID: 55345
Speaker 1: As for me in the integrated process, I was sent to Leon High School [Tallahassee, Florida] and Leon High School is a traditional high school for Leon County because it was the only high school that all the white folks who graduated from Leon County prior to integration when to, there were no other white school that they would have gone to, high school.  So everybody is oriented to Leon.  And you asked a two-part question when you talked about getting into politics and the school settings.  It was Leon High School having been in the right school at the right did I think created the right results.  Leon High School's old principal had been there for years, retired.  And they hired Fred Murray from up in Ohio to come down and be the principal of Leon High School.  He brought with him his assistant principal from up there to Leon and the superintendent sent me to Leon because of what I, I'm assuming a considered my even temperament in the black administrators which would mean-- diminished now because with integration they've got all these black school administrators that been out in rural school and they have no place to place 'em now as they have integrated the schools in the city because they already had a principals, so what you gonna do with all these other people.  But that was a real no concern to me at time, but I was called in the superintendent and the superintendent didn't pull any bones.  He said, "I'm gonna send you over to Leon because I don't got nobody else that I can send that I think can keep the lid on things."  That's the kind of way he put it, so I'm a guinea pig.  And I recognized that situation, that I was going into a hotbed because like everything else in the integrated process doing this period of time, there was conflict.  There's no questions about that.  Any time you gonna change people lifestyle and put into a situation where they don't feel comfortable don't feel a part of, you got tensions.
Story_ID: 55346
Speaker 1: What type of conflicts did you have when you went in, you were assistant principal or principal [at Leon High School]?
Speaker 2: Assistant Principal.
Speaker 1: What type of conflicts existed while you were there?  If you could give a few instances.
Speaker 2: Well let me give you an example of something that's not conflict, construed as conflict. You see, perceived things and reality are not the same.  An incident occurred, well you have to know the campus is like, it had a steep bank.  The school is uphill and the kids or parents or anybody else got the edge of it and a lot of kids are out there to see what is going on they push the people in front over the embankment, okay.  Just before lunch one day, some parents came up to the school, in the parking lot, it's at the bottom and there was some conflict between the parents at the bottom.  Well because of this slight conflict, the kids who were outside out front rushed to the bank and, of course, a lot of 'em got pushed over the embankment.  The whole thing was never racial, but when the word got to the office and all these white kids and these black kids that's down there trying to recover themselves from the fall and everything, I guess someone looking on thought it was a riot, thought whatever it was.  It hit the cafeteria during lunchtime, the kids are outside fighting and rioting, well [principal] Fred Murray, being the person oriented like he was, of quelling riot situation on the campus, immediately got in touch with the sheriff's office and within a few minutes we were surrounded with Sheriff [Raymond Reed] Hamlin that wore his black hat all the time cigar in his mouth and was stubborn as hell, he came down there and now he's gonna take over the school and in essence he basically did.  Well by the time the assistant principal and all of us got the root and fathomed out what really took place and what was happening at the time, the campus is crawling and by now telephone calls have been made, white parents coming to pick up their kids 'cause black kids are beating 'em up and all of this, which did not occur.  And the school obviously couldn't call and couldn't do about anything and there was no reason to dismiss school it was not that.  But what immediately happened was as soon as the sheriff's department got there, the students solidified, it's us and them and the pigs have arrived.  And now this has infuriated Sheriff Raymond Hamlin.  And we're like under siege at school.
Story_ID: 55347
Speaker 1: So we finally got everybody out and bussed home.  There never was a racial conflict at all, but a perceived one that got out of hand.  The next morning when school open, the Sheriff and everybody still on campus.  They there that morning walking the halls and student body then played a big role in my election into political office.  And the kids, like I immediately told you had solidified themselves and when they saw the law there that day it was hard for us to maintain control because the students now have gotten themselves in a protest posture where they want the pigs off the campus and then we gonna go to class.  Now I want you to fathom out the situation we're faced with here now.  We need to get these kids out of the hall and into the classroom where they legitimately belong but the Sheriff won't leave the campus.  With all our persuasion, we got him off about noon, but it took us about that long to get what we considered law and order in some semblance of running the school.  So that was the experience that that we had, the worst experience that I had in the as far as integration is concerned in the school.  In fact, I think it ran--integration at Leon High School really ran very smoothly.  And that goes back to the leadership of the student body president, Doug Mannheimer.
Story_ID: 55348
Speaker 1: Sir, how does this then lead you to City Commissioner?
Speaker 2: Well the school at this point has nothing to do with what occurred.  What occurred as far as the City Commission, me becoming involved in that was the Reverend R.N. Gooden of SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] and other black ministers who had been in the leadership of Tallahassee [Florida] for years, over a period of years doing the struggle of the city ends and bus boycotts and all that other stuff, they were key figures in those activities.  Two city commission seats came up for election.  And these two people run for reelections.  One was the Dean of the Commission and other one was almost at the same status as far as invincibility.  And there was a coalition of blacks' with the pastors and some members of the white community who were inspiring to run for these seats.  And they meet Father Brooks' church who was also a minister in during bus boycott, very strong person and that night I got an invitation to attend the reelection rally at his church.  Me and Herman Landers who was principal of middle--Griffin middle school at the time and we were good friends when had been friends for--lifetime friends.  So I said to Herman, "let's go over and see what they're talking about tonight."  So we mosey over to the church, sit in the back listen to all kinds of dialogue and schemes until I got tired of listening to rhetoric that was totally impossible to execute in the timeframe that they had and totally impossible and illogical for even go into such a coalition to do  because it was never going to work.  And I sat there I took about as much it I could take 'cause Reverend Gooden would not divulge who--he made this statement, "We already have our black candidate, but we're not telling who the person is yet."  Now imagine being at a coalition, cooperation and everything you got a candidate and we don't know who the black candidate is well we see three white candidates out here who is vying to the black citizens at the church for their support.  So I just visualized all this stuff and I said--I took about long as I could and I stood up in the back of the church and I made the following statement, "My name is James R. Ford, I reside at 2024 North Meridian Road and as to date I have not been interviewed about black candidate for-to enter into the election process and as I visualized the plans that ya'll have tonight it's seem to me that you've got impossible dreams.  Number one, I heard a lot of rhetoric that how ya'll gonna go over in three weeks and make Christians out of the white folks in South City?"  I say, "Now that's an impossible dream that simple can and will not occur.  Number two, you've got three candidates here that's aspiring for the leadership for your votes in this coalition, what have ya'll decided about which of the three ya'll gonna support in the coalition?"  And-I've forgotten the other part of it, but anyway, when the meeting was over I got surrounded by the newspaper people and students from FSU [Florida State University] as to whether I was a candidate.  I was not a candidate when I spoke I was not a candidate when I left.  I had no interest in it while I spoke I no interest in it when I left.  So after everything dispersed and everybody thinks now that I'm a quote, "candidate," which I am not, and no threat to anybody in it.
Story_ID: 55349
Speaker 1: Herman [Landers] and I-- the Trailways Bus Station then had a cafeteria in it and it's about 10:00.  So we little hungry so we decided we go to the Greyhound, not the Greyhound, the Trailways Bus Station and get us some food.  So we sat there and we mulled over the political situation in Tallahassee [Florida].  We talked about the nine people, nine blacks who had run before and none of them never got elected.  We talked about the section of town and the county that they lived in.  And we just generally talked about the whole political scene in the City of Tallahassee then we talked about who, you know, didn't want to tell us who the candidate is so we don't know now who be got black that gonna try and present us.  So we got on that subject.  And finally after little bit of discussion I start to Herman, "Do you realize what we're sitting here doing all night?  We been talking about getting somebody else to do something that we're not willing to do," just like that.  And he said, "Are you saying that you, you're a candidate?"  "Nah, I ain't saying that I'll be no candidate for anything."  So he said-"Beside I don't know nothing about campaigning.  I don't have not money, I don't have none of these other things."  Herman sat over there and thought a minute like he deliberately think and he said--I came out and said rather, joking, purely joking, I said, "If I decided to run for that thing I don't have a campaign manager, would you be the campaign manager?"  He said, "If you that big damn fool, yes."  So we past that off and went home and left it at that.  That was the end of that conversation.  This is on a Friday.  The deadline of qualifying is Tuesday.  Keep in mind both of us go to work Monday and school all that.  Monday I get a call from Herman.  "What you decided to do J.R.?"  "What you talking bout what I decided to do?"--I didn't even--I wasn't even thinking about what he was talking about.  He said, "What you gonna do, you got to qualify for tomorrow you know?"  I said, "Herman, we ain't got no campaign nothing.  I don't know nothing about getting ready of anything."  So he said, "If we gonna do it we gotta do it by tomorrow evening, 4:00."  That was the deadline for qualifying.
Story_ID: 55350
Speaker 1: So obviously Herman and I met after school that evening and it was that evening that we tried to find us a campaign-we found out what an organization needed to go sign up with the supervisor of elections.  So you had to have yourself a Treasurer and a campaign manager and all that good stuff.  So Herman was the campaign manager now quote.  "We ain't got no campaign treasurer."  So we thought about a retired colonel Willie Jenkins, who worked at A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University in Tallahassee, Florida] over a long period of time we thought of.  And we all accepted the treasurer.  Now we ain't got no money and we don't know what the qualifying fee was we didn't realize and didn't know that there was no qualifying fee.  So when the credit union--I went to the credit union and I drew out $300.00 'cause I thought like the kind of commission or something else.  That was 1/10th of the salary that was the qualifying fee.  And at that particular time City Commissioner made $3,000.00.  So I needed $300.00 and I went up to the office to qualify and gave the man--was giving the man the money and he didn't take my money and everything.  So I gave my $300.00 to Will Jenkins and that's the first money that went into my campaign coffers.  And after that the rest basically is history and the organization and everything else except at this particular time we decided that we would not put our campaign headquarters on the other side of town.  Because there has always been a conflict between the town and the gown.  And the railroad track always separated A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University in Tallahassee, Florida] from Frenchtown [Tallahassee, Florida] and Springfield and the other black community.  So we rented a little storefront that wasn't--that store front wasn't as big as what we are in now.  The campaign headquarters wasn't as large as this structure is in here.  But we started and, of course with the help of some professors at A&M University and some other people, we ran the campaign and of course the outcome you know.  But that was the inception and what really occurred.
Speaker 2: And that's--what year is that?
Speaker 1: That was 1971.
Story_ID: 54867
Speaker 1: You wanted to tell us about how your students at Leon High School [in Tallahassee, Florida] played a prominent role in you being elected to City Commissioner, tell that.
Speaker 2: Yes, Doug Mannheimer which is an automobile dealer with the Cadillac Company here and his mother, his mother is deeply involved in Democratic parties, political work and Doug was Student Body President at Leon High School.  After I ascertained from Fred Murray, the principal of the school, whether or not I had his permission to run for the office and he had given me that and I had talked with the superintendent and the school board, they had given their permission for me to do so.  And of course, we all--our slogan at Leon High School is that Leon High School is Number One and Leon is Number One.  And all during the time of the campaign and everything, Doug and the students of Leon High School would go back and talk to their parents and many of the parents didn't know me but because of their children who told them you've got to vote for Mr. Ford because Mr. Ford is the only one to get anything done.  That's what Dr. Musten (ph) son came home him about me and the school at that particular time, so Mr. Musten said "I voted for you because when my son came home and told me that you were the only one over there that gets anything done at that school, I knew I was going to vote for you."  That was his comment.  Well I'm sure many other parents in the white community that when those kids went home and took my literature and talked to their parents, that made a difference because when we looked at the precincts and the tallies and everything, you could see that very prominently in the votes. So I owe a lot to Leon High School and Leon County and especially to Doug Mannheimer.  And of course the morning that-- after the election on the bulletin board was not "Leon is Number One" and my name and everything because it was in tradition with Leon being Number One.  When the Democratic Governor ask you-- need the Hospitality Committee for a National Democratic Convention in Miami that year, I took Doug to Miami to the National Democratic Convention and arranged for him to get on the floor during the sessions.  And the last letter, he wrote me back some years back, I got a copy I just looked at it not too long ago, he said that's the highest point of his life was to have that opportunity to go the convention and get on the floor and everything.  He considered that a great crowning achievement and I felt very good about it and when I retired from the school system, he was one of the speakers who brought comments on my retirement program and he was magnificent and I have a great deal of respect for Doug and all the people in Leon County who supported me.  Because without that I would have never been where I am now.
Speaker 1: So the benefits of integration for you were incredible for the students also?
Speaker 2: Right, so from the standpoint of integration it did work in my favor in that, in that instances where it's a plus.
Story_ID: 54868
Speaker 1: So now [1971] you're on the city commission, tell us what your experiences--you were still an educator also at the same time?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So explain how it is when you first get to the city commission.
Speaker 2: Oh there were all kinds of rumors floating when I got re-elected.  Like there a rumor floating that Loren Lovell and me we were the two new we replaced the two commissioners how, how we were going to change and seep out the old guard and change things.  But people were unrealistically because you can't sweep out the old guard with two people.  You gotta have three.  Because you got have three people to pass anything of the five in the commission.  That was one of the rumors that was floating around.
Speaker 1: Now after you're on, it's not long before you start becoming quite active though (laughter) in some of the things that are changed.  But I would like you to tell us about how you become the first African American Mayor of not just Tallahassee [Florida] but the Capitol of the State, City in America.
Speaker 2: The mayor for the City of Tallahassee is elected by his peers and his duties are while they are ceremonial--
Story_ID: 54869
Speaker 1: It's basically he [the Mayor of Tallahassee, Florida] does the same thing as mayors of all other cities except he does not do the administrative things other than that the duties would be the same.  When I became--well before I became mayor and worked on the commission, I established a great deal of rapport with the other members of the commission.  And I soon earned the position of being the tie breaker of the one who made the ultimate decision and what the commission decided to do.  I was ended up with that--in that position.  Whichever way that I went that was what was going to be the outcome.  And it was just plain and simple.  And this was, believe it or not an excellent position to be in.  In fact, it was a better position to be in then had I been another white commission because now I have the option of being the decision maker, absolute decision maker, the unquestionable decision maker.  So obviously now I have to be the person that when something is going to happen that if the opposing sides are the other side, they have to convince me of which of these issues is the best thing to do and there have been times that I didn't agree with the most popular of the sides and decision that were made.  And many times I had been on the minority side.
Speaker 2: How does this lead to the decision of you becoming Mayor?  What are the--(unclear)(simultaneous) --
Speaker 1: Well having worked closely with my colleagues, not having a great deal of conflict and having a great deal of professionalism and most of all a great deal of ability to perceive what the problems were and to come up with logical solutions.  So I was not a person unlearned and unfamiliar with city government and the way it operated so there was no reason under the sun that they could come up and find reasons not to support me.
Story_ID: 54870
Speaker 1: So what was the racial atmosphere in Tallahassee [Florida] like in 1972 when you become Mayor?
Speaker 2: Basic Tallahassee fine.  We had, we had a Ku Klux Klan rally that came to town that created for me quite a situation in the city.  The Ku Klux Klan in Florida decided that they were gonna have a march at the Capitol and they applied for a permit that even many whites didn't want to be issued.  But my position on issuing the permit was the City of Tallahassee is everybody in the State of Florida's City that we belong to the State of Florida.  Not just Tallahassee because the Capitol is here, the streets are here.  If these people want to have a march they have every reason and right to have their parade and march down the streets of this city as any other citizen in Leon County or Tallahassee or NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] or whatever we have, they have that right to march.  It does not mean that the City of Tallahassee condones what they represent but they are citizens of this state and according to the laws of this county we don't have a leg to stand on not to issue that permit to march.  Now what this has sparked in the surrounding area and in the City of Tallahassee and just about everywhere else--this particular incident really put Tallahassee on the map.  Because we had vans from every network in the county stationed in Tallahassee for the march.  Everybody anticipated what is going to happen.  The permit was issued.  And this caused a great amount of dissatisfaction, decent on A&M's [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University] campus, the position that I took and it also caused throughout the panhandle and other places who supporters or who had an opposing ideas for the Klan and the half of the Klan. There were these two factions and at this particular time CB [Citizen's Band] radios was the fad.  Not cell phones not everything else.  Everybody and every trucker and every white person just about had big whip antenna on his truck and CB nicknames and everything else.  And we had a few blacks who the same kinds of things.  So obscenities and everything else permeated the airwaves night and day until the day of the Klan march, which kept the climate extremely hot all the time.  Kids at A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University] was protesting and having rallies and everything so I went out there and I had the lay the law down to them what the situation was going to be and I told them the same thing.  That "you're all are not going to come down to City Hall and the streets of this city and ruin my administration with some dumb protest that all you got to do and though you disagree, is stay on this campus and be safe because I don't have any idea at this junction what you safety looks like if you come down there and get confrontational with jears and all this kind of stuff.  I gonna have all kinds of law enforcement there but I can't guarantee you anything.  Now I'll tell you what will happen should you do that.  If you decide to come down there and break the laws for the City of Tallahassee you are going to go to jail unquestioned.  You are going to go to jail, no excuses, no anything.  I--when we had the bus boycotts bailed many of you who graduated from this school and put bail money and everything else to get this school and your support for your civil rights and I will continue to do that, but in this particular case these people have the legitimate right to do what they want to do and get out of town.  I'm gonna try to facilitate that they come in peacefully and exit peacefully.  But I cannot do that by myself and if I ever needed your cooperation, it's now."
Story_ID: 54871
Speaker 1: So the morning of the march I had no idea what they were gonna do.  I had no idea of what the redneck country was going to do.  And as I was trying to get some rest that night, a brilliant idea hit me that didn't set so good with the Chief of Police and the City Manager.  I called them and told them, said the Police Chief and the City Manager, I said "8:00 in the morning we gonna meet in front of City Hall.  You and--me and the two of you are going to lead this parade."  Oh Lord why did I say that.  And of course they were shocked beyond comprehension that I would come up with such a suggestion to do.  And now it's an executive order to do.  Neither one of them was prepared for what the eventuality nor did they know or nor did I know what would occur.  But I had already alerted the National Guard, I had them minutes away already committed.  I had all the law enforcement that I could possibly need available at a moment's notice.  They were all ready.  Some incognito and other situations.  But all they needed was the fact that I agreed to let they know if I had a situation where it was almost a Marshall Law effect situation.  I said now, Dan and the Chief, I said, "This is our strategy.  If the three of us walk down Main Street in front of this Ku Klux Klan, the people of this community is going to feel that it's safe.  The people in this community is going to say to themselves, 'if they can walk down the street then nothing bad can happen in the city today.'"  We walked that entire route and loaded up the Ku Klux Klan that easily and shipped them out of town and we had two incidents.  One was where somebody threw a brick at a member of the Klan and another was jeers and insults that you will see on one of the pictures there of the Klansman that said nothing.  But it went off just that smoothly and we got them out of town.  But that was for the march, jeers and insults and things was happening the whole time they were at the Ramada Inn and various other Inns and thing.  That something it ain't my problem (laughter).  That's not my problem, that's a personal problem with them.  But it did, it did--it was one of the most tense moments I had to experience in political career.
Story_ID: 54872
Speaker 1: On a continual basis you were an activist Mayor [of Tallahassee, Florida], you weren't just a--
Speaker 2: No I've never been I've never been not active in what was going on.
Speaker 1: Now tell us about the elimination of the separate Christmas parties (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  Well, and this was a by choice, this was a by choice decision however.  But it violated, it violated the tenor of city--of integrated city government that I stood for.  But they had the black Christmas party at Dade Street [Community] Center and the white Christmas party at the fairgrounds.  Now inherit behind this was two or three things.  Type of music and dancing and I think this was the crux of the problem of having the two Christmas parties.  So the drinking and the interaction and social actions and so forth, I think created this tension of having the two parties the City Manager found himself in the position of having to have two parties and pay twice for what a Christmas party should be costing the city.  And he was trying to satisfy both of those groups and I just flat out told him "I recognize the position you're in, I recognize the fact these people don't wanna socialize together and they want different kind of music and have a better time separately and I recognize very clearly that they would in fact have a better time.  But it's not city policies that we do that.  Therefore, you come up with another way of solving the problem."  The ball's in his court and that's his problem now not mine.  But they were eliminated.
Speaker 1: So how, how did the first integrated party go?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  I would assumed it went alright.  I'm sure a lot of people didn't go.
Story_ID: 54873
Speaker 1: Some, I mean you just have career while being on the City Commissioner's amazing, but one of the most amazing things is you obtained high bond for the City of Tallahassee [Florida].  Can you explain how you went through the process of that?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, the City of Tallahassee during my administration gained the highest bond rating in the market.  The City of Tallahassee bond's value is Triple A.  Got to Double A then we went to Triple A before we--before I left office.  But any way, what we did, is we always took the commission and our administrative offices to the bond market.  We took them to New York [New York City, New York].  And there was a little blip people or questioned going to New York first class and somebody, some reporter had called New York hotel real early in the morning while I wasn't fully awake too good and they pissed me off by asking a dumb question like, "Why do you travel and take all these people first class?"  And I fired right back "Because we represent a first class city."  We haven't had any more dumb questions asked about that issue.  It became a dead issue.  And I learned a lot about going to the bond market and I had to use a signature machine the first time I ever seen a signature machine where you can sign about twenty bonds each time you sign your signature because my signature had to be on every bond, and $25 million dollars' worth of bonds sold, my signature had to be the signature on that--on the bonds.
Speaker 1: I want you to --(unclear)(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And I got a picture out there of that machine and me actually signing.
Speaker 1: What I do want you to explain what a bond rating is for a city?
Speaker 2: A bond rating for a city represents its stability, its financial worth, its dependability and taking care of its debts and its unlikeliness to default on the issue and it also gives the city or a decrease in what they can borrow the money from the bond market.  The rate of interest we pay, diminishes with the rating you hold.
Speaker 1: So what was it before you got there?
Speaker 2: I don't remember exactly what those fees were or the rates that we were paying.  The newspaper, one of the newspaper articles out there do state what those ratings were and what the ratings were after.
Speaker 1: But it went up after during--
Speaker 2: Yeah our rating up but the cost for us to borrow the money went down.  See as your rating goes up, what you pay for the money goes down.  So it's important to try to have high ratings.
Story_ID: 54874
Speaker 1: Now during all this time while you're in office, doing all these things, you're still an educator [at Leon Public Schools].  Explain how that's going?
Speaker 2: Well I got a letter from the school board allowing me to take whatever time I needed to take off for my political duties, but make up the time by either loss of sick leave, the loss of vacation time or make up time at school during holidays and various other things like everybody's gone for the Christmas holidays though I didn't have anything to do at the school, I was on duty.  You understand what I'm saying, technically.
Speaker 1: So what you made--did you still make your presence known--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  I carried out all my mayoral duties and I carried out all of my educational duties.
Speaker 1: How did you balance the two?
Speaker 2: Well that really wasn't as difficult as it sounds because of time perimeters when various things occurred.  Many of the things, for instance, if I had to greet somebody at a Kiwanis breakfast the breakfast is usually over by 7:45, school takes in about 8:00 not losing a lot of time.
Story_ID: 54875
Speaker 1: A few more questions and we're gonna get to your pictures.  I wanna ask you, it's a two-fold question.  The first one: explain the role of today that African American educators need to take in the African American community?  That's the first question.
Speaker 2: That's about as loaded as you can ask.  I think that educators today are going to have to become more dedicated in their students' learning and not just be sitting up there throwing the data out there and you can get it, if you're tuned to the channel and you got a good antenna or a good set.  You gonna have to make sure that you do some of the stuff that Mrs. Williams did for me.  You got a lot of bright students.  All the people that you got out there in front of you today's education is not dummies by a long shot.  They certainly not have the exposure to some things, they simple have not had anybody who showed any real interest in their welfare and many of them have never had a role model.  So the educator today is going have to fulfill a lot of roles or be able to perceive and to recognize students with potential but who lacks certain other things and gaps in their education that must filled in.  Now that's a tall issue, but if you're gonna achieve something or going to do something, you gonna have to go back and make sure that it has a good foundation.  No architect would build a house or a bridge then and worry about in his mind, I wonder whether or not the foundation is strong enough to hold all of this, will it?  And you know full well if you're building an educational building that if the kid doesn't have a good math background and he wants to go into medicine and he wants to go into architecture, he wanna go in something else and he's poor at math, the school of architecture or whatever it is, is gonna make sure that that student knows math.  It's just that simple.
Story_ID: 54876
Speaker 1: Now the next question I have--ask you sir is what do you think the role of African Americans elected officials is toward the black community and how they can help assist the black community?
Speaker 2: That's another one of those loaded questions, but I'll answer that question this way and you're gonna find it odd that I'm gonna say it this way.  I think that an elected official should be an official who is elected to look out for the welfare of the community and in that encompasses all the facets and all the ethnic group in that community, I do not feel that my role and I never felt that my role was to, quote, "do something for the black community."  Quote, my role is an should have been and should be for any black elected official, is to be able to survey the needs for the governmental agency that he represents and that he faithfully do his best to fulfill those needs whether it's housing, whether it's sanitation, whether it's street painting, whether it's streetlights, whether it's contributions to enhance specific neighborhoods.  That's a part of his role that's not--that is not a black issue.  It becomes an issue because we have allowed ourselves to perceive things that occur in a black and white setting.  And that's not the way your tax dollars come in, that's not the way they should be dispersed.  And if we were going to truthfully disperse money based on ethnicity, we would never be able to do the things in the black community that we do at the present or that we've done at the past.  To me stewardship of the entire community regardless of the ethnic area that you represent and while I am black, I represent everybody in Tallahassee [Florida].  That's been my attitude in the past, that's what I think any politician who's worth--the fact that he's elected ought to feel.  He ought to feel an obligation.  That does not mean that he does not do more acute thinking, do more acute effort in that bringing up substandard situations in the community.  That's what he ought be doing.  He ought be making sure nothing in his city and community that's substandard and if it exists he ought be putting forth all of his energies in rectifying the situation.  And he's not rectifying those situation, because, "I'm gonna go down to the black community and I'm going to do this for them and they are going to feel greatly appreciative for my efforts and I will be rewarded and be recognized as a great champion of the black community".  That ain't doing nothing but changing the situation down in the black community.  There's no point in polarizing or taking credit for something that is a group effort.  There is no black official in the United States that can do anything by himself because by virtue that he's black nor can he do all that probably the black constituency assumes that he came do.  That is another thing got to really look at that your black elected official cannot possible achieve your expectation level.  No matter how long he stays there.  Because he simply doesn't have that much power.

Speaker 1: Now, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community as it is today?
Speaker 2: Well I like to see the African American community first of all become economically independent.  By that I mean support black-owned businesses, use your money wisely, also become more politically astute because power is, and in the United States is going to come from two sources, economic and political.  If you have great impact on those two things, you are going to be able to demand and get many of things that you feel you need and want.  But if you're lacking in either of those two particular things, you'll be in bad shape.  Because I told my kids and I told a lot of people this little slogan that comes from the Bible that deals with, "he who has, shall be given, he who have not, that which he seem to have shall be taken away".  And if you go around with your hat in your hands, you hat in your hands in the black community, begging, soliciting and doing all of these kinds of things all your life you're gonna end up in that role.  Nobody is gonna lean you any money of any sort if you can't pay it back--if you appear you can't pay it back.  Nobody is gonna offer you a coke if you go into the bar if you look like a tramp.  And if you're gonna go in for a job interview you ought to look like you gonna be a value to the employer.  There's a lot of things that go into improving this situation other than the fact of black rhetoric.
