Speaker 1: Okay, do you know where that is?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, what's it close to now?
Speaker 2: It's close to the Pearl River, it's sort of southeastern Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay, is it near Coxhill [ph.], Scope [ph.] or?
Speaker 2: Those two names don't ring a bell.
Speaker 1: Okay, southeast, okay.  Alright, well, tell us what you know about the ancestors on your mother's side how, how far back can you trace those ancestors?
Speaker 2: I guess through my great-grandmother, I don't recall her name but I've seen pictures of her, she was a slave.  And I have pictures of my grandmother, but my grandmother passed away when I was a real young kid, so I just have pictures.
Speaker 1: Okay, were they from, was she from that area too, around Pearlington (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, are there, there any stories that are passed down in the family about life during slavery or, or?
Speaker 2: Well, more stories about life in Pearlington, apparently Pearlington at the time my mother was growin up was a pretty rough town in terms of racism.  You know it's all of the kind of virulent racism you would expect in the Deep South.  And so, most of the stories I've heard have been, you know, about that type of genre, in fact, you know, my mother left Pearlington when she was a relatively young age because of that.
Speaker 1: Okay, did are there any specific stories that you remember that can tell us?
Speaker 2: Well, the, the story that my mother repeated a lot was that there's a sign in Pearlington as you came into town that said, "Nigger, if you can't, Nigger run, and if you can't read, run anyway."  So, and that was just a story that was repeated often, about, you know, what life in Pearlington was all about.
Speaker 1: Yea, this is a, usually when you approach small towns there's a sign for the Kiwanis Club [Kiwanis International] and the other institutions, (laughter), but this is a fixture in Pearlington (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, yea so, that does illustrate what those times were like.  So, did your mother talk about growin up in Pearlington?
Speaker 2: Well actually she left Pearlington, when she was about three or so and moved to Orange, Texas.  And, so most of the, you know, family conversations where about growing up in Orange, Texas.  Because, you know, her mother and uncle lived in Orange, and they-re a pretty close-knit family.  I still have a lot of cousins in Orange, Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay, now where is Orange?
Speaker 2: Orange is about two hundred, no about one hundred miles east of Houston, Texas.  It's about five or ten minutes from the Louis--, Louisiana border.
Speaker 1: Okay, so well, what stories does she tell about Orange, Texas?
Speaker 2: Oh, just I mean they, they are you know a lot of family things like stories about my uncle, Uncle Simon [ph.].  He was apparently a very frugal man and very strict man.  And so, you know, she and her two sisters and you know the other cousins always tipped around the fact that, you know, he was very frugal and I'm, I'm using that as a euphemism that he was cheap (laughter).  But, you know he, you know, it was, it was a very close-knit family, you know between my grandmother and Uncle Simon.  And they all lived I think in the same, you know, complex.  It was a house that had a separate house on the property in addition to the main house.  And I think, you know, my mother and, and her sisters and, and her mother lived in that whole complex with, with Uncle Simon, as well as, you know, with his other, his daughters.  And, you know, just they had a lot of fun stories about all the things they did as, as kids.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was that kind of thing in Orange.  There were never any stories about, you know, racial issue in Orange, although I'm sure there must have been because, you know, of where it was located.  But, you know, most of the stories dealt with just all the things they did as kids growin up.
Speaker 1: So since it was hard focus anything else in Pearlington, but in Orange, you actually could have a life where you didn't necessarily focus on that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Right, right, yeah they had a real good family life in Orange.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right did, did your mother get a chance to go to go college or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No, she didn't even graduate from high school.  But, you know, despite that, you know, education was very important to her in terms of me.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did, did she stay in, in Orange or did she move to Houston at some point?
Speaker 2: No she, she moved to Houston I think, she was around ten or so.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she grew up partially in, in Houston, then I guess too right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did she go to high school there in Houston?
Speaker 2: I think so, pretty sure.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know there's a famous high school there I can't think of the name of it.
Speaker 2: Probably Jack Yates [High School, Houston, Texas], there's two, there's Phillis Wheatley High School [Houston, Texas], there's Jack Yates (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  Phillis Wheatley I think is the one that a lot of the older people went to. Yeah, Phillis Wheatley.
Speaker 2: Right, right, but Jack Yates was the high school in the Third Ward [Houston, Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right do you, do you know which one she went to?
Speaker 2: Probably Jack Yates.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --all right.
Story_ID: 253209
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Peter Frederick Hurst, P-E-T-E-R, F-R-E-D-E-R-I-C-K, H-U-R-S-T.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what do you know about the ancestors on your, oh I'm sorry, what was his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: It was April 23, 1902.
Speaker 1: All right and where was he born?
Speaker 2: Jeanerette, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: And how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: J-E-N-E-R-E-T [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay, now what, what did you know about the ancestors on your father's side?
Speaker 2: Not a whole lot, he, he never talked a lot about, he had I think a couple of brothers, I think but I never met them.  They were all dead by the time I was born.  And I think his mother and father were both dead by the time I was born.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there's no stories about that side of the family?
Speaker 2: No, he moved to Houston [Texas] at, at a pretty young age.  And, you know most of the stories I heard were from mother [Ophelia Richardson Hurst] about his mother who was, you know his mother was a pretty interesting personality.  Who you know had really kept our father's family together, and was a very important influence in my father's life.  So even as an adult, so most of the stories, I've heard about his mother were from my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay, what kind of stories do they, they tell about her?
Speaker 2: Well she was a very strong woman, and a very strong willed woman.  And, you know, had a very, you know, significant influence over my father even when he was an adult.  So it was, you know, those kinds of, you know, interchanges.  And my mother and father's mother apparently had a very good relationship.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, well, did your father get a chance to go to school and?
Speaker 2: He, no he went to high school, he did not graduate from high school, but he, he did attend high school in Houston.  And I think he also attended Jack Yates [High School, Houston, Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay, so did, is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they didn't meet in high school.  They, they met, I think they were at a dance and my father came over and asked my mother to dance with him.  And she initially said no, and he persisted and, you know, they, they ultimately danced and, you know, started talking and started going out.  But it wasn't from my mother's perspective it wasn't love at first sight.  So he had to pursue her, pretty, you know, thoroughly (laughter), to make any progress (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 253210
Speaker 1: What did your parents [Ophelia Richardson Hurst and Peter Hurst, Sr.] do for a living?
Speaker 2: My father was a baker, and my mother was a maid.
Speaker 1: Okay and so what, what were their personalities like, I mean--?
Speaker 2: Polar opposites. My father had a hearing problem, so he was, you know, relatively quiet, read a whole lot.  And my mother was incredibly out going, you know, would talk without taking a breath.  So you know, they were a pretty interesting match in the sense that you know, you know.  She never had to compete with my father for air time, (laughter).  And my father was content to let her, you know, talk as much as you know she wanted to and when he got tired of her he could just turn his hearing aide off, (laughter) so.
Speaker 1: So, so who do you think you take after the most, your mother or your father?
Speaker 2: I think both, I, I see, you know, parts of myself in both of 'em.  You know my mother was probably the toughest person mentally, I've ever come across and I think I get that from her.  She was very you know focused on community service and I get that from her.  My father you know just devoured information, you know he read you know magazine and newspapers and books and, and I, I think I get that from him.  And he was pretty, he was pretty even keeled.  I don't think I'm as even keeled as he is, but you know you seldom saw my father upset about anything.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, I think, you know, I see a lot of both of them in me.
Story_ID: 253211
Speaker 1: Now, do you have any siblings?
Speaker 2: No I'm an only child.
Speaker 1: Only child, okay.  Your parents [Ophelia Richardson Hurst and Peter Hurst, Sr.] now had you pretty late in life?
Speaker 2: Well actually I'm adopted (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah so I, I think my mother was, I do the math maybe 46 or 48, I think my father was you know like eight years older.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you know anything about your biological parents at all or you?
Speaker 2: Not a lot, not a lot.
Speaker 1: And they, they were still pretty well along to, to want to adopt a child, did, did they ever talk about why they wanted to (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well mother had you know like at least three miscarriages, 'cause they tried to have children.   And so she had miscarried at least three times, and had pretty much given up.  So and then I came along.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so you didn't, you didn't really, you don't know very much about, you how that did they adopt you did from someone in the community or?
Speaker 2: I think so, but and I'll as I recall I was probably you know a very young infant when they brought me home, so that was all I ever knew.
Story_ID: 253212
Speaker 1: All right now do you have an, an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I got a lot of them, I had a very (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, the earliest one. Is there one that's--?
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memory was, I was about four years old and it snowed in Houston [Texas].  And the reason why I remember it so clearly is that it only snow about three times between the time I was born and the time I went away to college [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina].  And I remember, and again we're talking about just a signet of snow but the whole town shut down, because it doe didn't snow that often in Houston, Texas.  And we built a snowman and you know if you see the picture of the snowman, it's like we must of cleared out ever speck of snow that was in the back yard to do it, because it was nothing left.  But that's probably one of my earliest memories as a, as a child.
Speaker 1: Okay, you know what was your neighborhood like?
Speaker 2: It was you know I'd say a working class neighborhood, you know dbecause it was you know relatively poor but everyone and every house had someone that had a job.  You know so it wasn't a ghetto by any stretch of the imagination but it wasn't, wasn't even close to being middle class, it was definitely working class.  And you know everyone on the block knew everyone else.  And all of the, the kids you know which is something that you know I miss, all of the kids you know had surrogate parents that were all of the other adults in the neighborhood.  So you know if you're doing something that you were not supposed to do, someone else's parent would you know admonish you to stop.  And, and if you didn't when you got home you had double trouble because the fact that you'd done something wrong had already been reported to your parents.  And if you had anything to say you know, you were in even bigger trouble, so, so it was a pretty you know close knit neighborhood.
Story_ID: 253213
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up [in Houston, Texas]?
Speaker 2: In the neighborhood and in the house it was a lot, like in the neighborhood our--we had ditches on either side of the street--and our favorite activity was playing football in the street.  So you had to you know if you are running pattern on the, the sideline so to speak you had to catch the ball and then jump the ditch, or get pushed into the ditch.  And then other thing we did in my backyard, we had a basketball goal but it was nailed to a tree.  And so when you dribbled in you know to the basket it, it was a real old tree that had huge roots so you had to make sure you dribble between the roots or the ball was going to you know take a wayward bounce and go out of bounds.  And there was always activity every single day you know there was something going on in the neighborhood.  You know we all hung out together growing up.  And everything was mostly sports related.  You know playing football, playing basketball, in the summer you may play marbles, so it was a neighborhood where all of the kids hung out together.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how, how would you describe yourself as a, as a kid growin up, I mean what were you like and what did you like to do?
Speaker 2: I like to eat I was a pretty big kid growin up.  And I like to play sports, I really like to read.  You know, we had a TV, but I didn't, I don't think I watched a lot of TV.  You know it was just you know not as prevalent as it is today.  And so those were the things you know I played you know every day I was (unclear) playing sports.
Speaker 1: Okay, mostly football or (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And, football and basketball, and but you know literally every day we had a game going on.
Speaker 1: Now that part of the country is a lot of famous athletes come out of Houston [Texas] and around there.  Would did you go to school any, any of (unclear).
Speaker 2: No, none of my contemporaries were that famous.  I actually played football in junior high school [Sidney Lanier Junior High School; Bob Lanier Middle School, Houston, Texas] and high school [Mirabeau B. Lamar High School, Houston, Texas].  And you know so-so teams but there were certainly you know out of the Houston area, a lot of you know in both football and basketball a lot of big names.  But that was just like another world.
Story_ID: 253214
Speaker 1: Now what books did you like when you were growin' up?
Speaker 2: Oh I had a, I had a really interesting English teacher when I was in junior high [Sidney Lanier Junior High School; Bob Lanier Middle School, Houston, Texas].  And I read a lot of you know incredible books when I was young.  Like, books that would really stretch me and probably were beyond what a lot of kids in junior kids were reading.  Like I read 'Soul on Ice' [Eldridge Cleaver] when I was in junior high, I read the 'Invisible Man' [Ralph Ellison] I read the, the whole trilogy of the [J.R.R.] Tolkein trilogy, you know 'The Hobbit' and all that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'The Lord of the Rings.'
Speaker 2: Robert Hess [ph.] books, I read some [William] Faulkner, so I mean I had (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now this is as a, as a youth.
Speaker 2: As a junior, yeah in junior high, I mean, we, I had an English teacher that really pushed us, to and he would pick out books that were you know different.  'Cause you know, you know 'Invisible Man' and 'Soul on Ice' are really kinda of tough in junior high for a whole lot of reasons.  And you know I remember we read you know [John] Steinbeck.  And you know you actually have to write a report and then get up and talk about the book in front of the class, so it really pushed everyone.  So you know I, I just, I recently gave my son some, some books to read.  You know not the ones I had, because I, I have no idea where they are now.  But I bought him some books, that you know that I told him I read these in junior high school as a motivation for him, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now did your parents [Ophelia Richardson Hurst and Peter Hurst, Sr.] read a lot?
Speaker 2: My father did, my father you know just devoured newspapers, magazines and books you know, he would sit in the chair, he had a recliner, and he smoked a pipe and he smoked these cheap stinky cigars and he would just read.  'Cause again you know he was he had a hearing problem, so it was a lot easier for him to, to read than to listen to the TV or listen to the radio, even though he could.
Speaker 1: Okay now did he have his own bake shop or did he work for a big bakery?
Speaker 2: No he worked for someone else he worked for like a small bakery and his specialty, specialties included donuts and pies and cakes, in fact he would bring home, home like a couple dozen donuts a night.
Speaker 1: Okay now you said you were a big kid is this, is this part of that?
Speaker 2: Well that's part of it, also my mother was a great cook but what happened was that I got sick of donuts.  So my father would still bring 'em home and they'd be warm and fresh the next morning and he would just give 'em away to other families in the neighborhood.  So he became a very popular personality because of that.  Because you could count on a couple of dozen donuts you know every single day.
Story_ID: 253215
Speaker 1: Now what grade school did you attend?
Speaker 2: E. L. Blackshear, B-L-A-C-K-S-H-E-A-R [Blackshear Elementary School, Houston, Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay was that named after a local Houston [Texas] person in the black community or?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at one time I could have told you the whole history of E. L. Blackshear, (laughter).  But yeah it was a, he was an African American in the Houston area.  And you know the principal was a good friend of my mother's [Ophelia Richardson Hurst] and a good friend of our family.  You know it was real good experience I had.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay E. L. Blackshear was, was he an educator or she?
Speaker 2: I don't recall, I don't recall.
Speaker 1: And it's an interesting name you don't hear it that much.  I know there's a famous artist named Thomas Blackshear in the black community kinda with the same name.  So, with any so this was a school where your parents knew the principals.  And was, where there any teachers there that I mean, that really made a difference in your life?
Speaker 2: Yeah there were several I, I would say from first grade to sixth grade, all of the teachers I thought you know made a positive impact on me.  Probably one that stands out was a Mrs. Mason [ph.], who was my fourth grade teacher.  And just, you know I guess the thing I remember is that she just really pushed me as well as all the other kids in the class.  You know she really thought we all had a lot of potential and she didn't you know settle for anything but you know doing the best she could.  And you know that's really important I think, especially at that age.  Just to instill in you, that you know, that you have a lot of potential, I'm not going to accept anything except your very best.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you have a favorite subject in grade school?
Speaker 2: Probably math I always enjoyed math, you know in grade school, junior high and senior high school [Mirabeau B. Lamar High School, Houston, Texas].
Speaker 1: Now we probably assume you, you were a pretty good student, if you're reading, I mean if you're at that level you were and enjoying math, but were you a good student?
Speaker 2: Yep I was, I was.
Speaker 1: All right now where did you go to junior high school?
Speaker 2: Actually for both junior high and high school I, I there was a voluntary busing program in Houston.  So I attended school across town at a predominantly white neighborhood.  And junior high was a high, junior high was called Sidney Lanier [Junior High School; Bob Lanier Middle School, Houston, Texas] and as I recall [Sidney] Lanier was a poet and that was grade seven, eight and nine.
Speaker 1: Okay and how did you like that, that now that's your first integrated school right?
Speaker 2: It was interesting experience, 'cause in essences you had a dual existence.  You had you know a school environment where you know most of the kids were white, not all though, I would say 20 percent of the student body was you know black and Hispanic.  But it was clearly a situation where minority kids where in the quote unquote minority.  And then you, you go back home and the whole neighborhoods black.  So, so it was definitely a dual existence.  But you know I had a really good experience both in the classroom and outside the classroom in junior high school.  And you know I played football, I was in the band, I took woodshop, which, you know, was, you know, I think a pretty enriching experience for me.
Story_ID: 253216
Speaker 1: What instrument did you play in the band?
Speaker 2: Played trumpet in junior high [Sidney Lanier Junior High School; Bob Lanier Middle School, Houston, Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay did you continue to play?
Speaker 2: Yeah also it was interesting my church had a band and so I played not only in school but also at church.
Speaker 1: Okay the trumpet?
Speaker 2: Yep and in senior high I, I picked up the baritone horn and played in the band my junior and senior year.
Speaker 1: Okay now what, what was the name of your church?
Speaker 2: Saint John [Missionary] Baptist Church [Houston, Texas] on Dowling Street.
Speaker 1: Okay, so is church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: It's a real big part of growing up.
Speaker 1: Okay, so I take it your parents [Ophelia Richardson Hurst and Peter Hurst, Sr.] were fairly religious (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah we went to not only did we go to church every Sunday, but one my parents usually my father would take me to Sunday school.  So, so you were in church a lot.  You know, you spend a lot of your Sunday's doing something related to the, to the church.  And so you know my junior high and senior high school years, a lot of my friends in addition to the folks in the neighborhood were folks from church.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so the neighborhood was pretty tight?
Speaker 2: Yep, yep
Speaker 1: Okay, now you had a trumpet in the, in the church, I mean so how, how extensive of, of an ensemble did the church have?
Speaker 2: Very extensive because you know our church was maybe 10 or 15 minutes from Texas Southern University [Houston, Texas].  And Texas Southern had a very at that time probably still does, but it had a very successful music program.  And two guys who were you know, who were leaders in the Texas Southern program, student leaders you know, one was like a band director and one was like a drum major, they were you know leading the church band as well.
Story_ID: 253217
Speaker 1: So we were talking about the church band you know and, you had said that some of the students from Texas Southern [University, Houston, Texas] were involved and?
Speaker 2: Yeah they were music majors and, and leaders of the Texas Southern band it was called the Ocean of Soul.  They also were members of our church [St. John Missionary Baptist Church, Houston, Texas].  So they would take you know the standard church fair and do arrangements that were really good.  And you know a lot of folks were very interested in music.  You know like in our church we had, actually had two bands and we had two youth choirs, we had two children's choirs, we had two adult choirs.  So, you know, music was a big part of the service when I was growin' up.
Story_ID: 253218
Speaker 1: Now where did you attend high school?
Speaker 2: I attended at Mirabeau Lamar, M-I-R-A-B-E-A-U Lamar [Mirabeau B. Lamar High School, Houston, Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay L-A-M-A-R-R?
Speaker 2: Just one R.
Speaker 1: Just one R, okay, all right.  Now is this another integrated high school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yep, yep.
Speaker 1: Were you bused to that one?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what part of Houston [Texas] was this high school?
Speaker 2: It was in a part of Houston called River Oaks [Houston, Texas] which is a very affluent part of town.  So it was a definitely a cross-cultural experience.
Speaker 1: Okay, well how did you like Lamar?
Speaker 2: I liked it, I mean I, I think I got a great education and did a lot in terms of after school activities.  I played football my tenth grade year and then I stopped playing and I was in the band my junior and senior year in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we had you know marching band and we had an orchestra and then we had a jazz band.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did what position did, did you play on football team?
Speaker 2: I played two both ways I was an offense guard and defensive tackle.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did, did your team do any good, I mean (unclear)?
Speaker 2: We were okay, but one reason I stopped I knew I mean, I was a pretty big kid you know given the other kids who played.  But I knew I wasn't a big enough to play you know line in college.  And so and the team was good but not great.  So I said you know really isn't worth the investment, because it really is a big investment to play football at that level.
Speaker 1: Yeah a lot of time involved in practice, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A whole lot of time and year round because you know you're training as soon as football season ended.  You know, you were lifting weights and running every day and then you'd have spring ball.  You know it was just a big investment.
Story_ID: 253219
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you get involved in other school activities when you were in high school [Mirabeau B. Lamar High School, Houston, Texas] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well in both junior high [Sidney Lanier Junior High School; Bob Lanier Middle School, Houston, Texas] and high school I was very involved in the scouting program.  And that's something that was probably along with athletics is one of the big positive influences for me as a kid.
Speaker 1: So you had a, did you have a, you must have had a decently organized scout troop, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yep, yep, we were actually it was in a boy scouting troop at another church not my own [St. John Missionary Baptist Church, Houston, Texas], Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church [Houston, Texas].  And you know it was probably at the time you know, one of the leaders in the country in terms of producing Eagle Scouts.  You know 'cause that's the highest rank in the scouting program.  And you know just an incredible experience not only in terms of you know leadership opportunities, but we would go camping a lot.  You know we would go camping it seem like if my recollection is correct you know at least once a month.  And it was just you know just a lot of fun for a city kid to go camping.
Speaker 1: Yeah now that is something once a month I mean (unclear) you know.
Speaker 2: But still the camp was only forty-five minutes away be still to get organized to do that and we really camped a lot.
Speaker 1: Well that is something I mean I know that yeah scouting can be a lot of fun especially when it is organized, like that.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now did you aspire to become an Eagle Scout?
Speaker 2: No but it's just something that you know once I got into it you know that was the highest you know rank you could achieve.  So I and I enjoyed it you know the whole scouting program so if I was going to be in it you know.  If fact the the night you know I got my eagle badge you know was still one of the more significant events for me.  Because that was one of the few major events in my life where both my mother [Ophelia Richardson Hurst] and father [Peter Hurst, Sr.] where there to experience it.
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause usually one had to work or something?
Speaker 2: Well no like all of the other events in my life my father died you know the summer after my freshman year in college [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina].  So after that you know all of the major events you know it was just my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay but they both had a chance to see you become an Eagle Scout now that's, that's something okay (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: And you became an Eagle Scout when you when you were what?
Speaker 2: I guess, I think I was sixteen.
Speaker 1: Okay all right now what else did you do in high school, were you in any high school clubs or did you run for office or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No I, I focused on you know athletics, the band and you know I was in things like the honor society.  But you know it's not like they took a lot of time so and, and you know in church activities.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I was involved in the band at church and you know we just spent a lot of time doing things at the church growin up.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you have a, are there any individuals either in church or high school or in the scouts that, that you would say were like mentors that really took a personal interest in developing you as a?
Speaker 2: Well yeah I, I think that the one of the more significant people was the scout master.  He's now deceased, his name was C. Reger Hall, R-E-G-E-R Hall.  And neither he and his wife didn't have any children, so I think we all became you know his adopted family.  And he was really committed to, to the scouting program.  He recruited assistant scout masters and it was incredibly organized.  I mean one of the reasons why I think our troop had so many Eagle Scouts, is that he really ran it like a business almost.  You know, things were not run haphazardly done and, and everyone took everything very seriously.  I mean we had a lot of fun but the structure was, was really incredible.  And the church that sponsored our troop was very supportive and committed you know to Scouting and that made a big difference.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you ever go to any of those, one of those big jamborees where all the scouts get together (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did I went to jamboree once and I you know for a kid that didn't have a lot of money I think I got, they had a scholarship program.  And I remember we took a bus to the jamboree and flew back.  And so we you know went through you know parts of the Deep South we, the jamboree was in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] that year.  And I know we spent at least one night in New York [New York], which I thought was the most amazing thing in the world at that time.  'Cause I'd never seen anything like the city and I remember you know getting White Castle hamburgers and getting sick (laughter).
Speaker 1: Had you ever been out of Tex- Texas at that time?
Speaker 2: Yeah I had but I'd only, I'd been you know with the church band.  You know to like a, you know the Baptist Convention.  I'd been to New Orleans [Louisiana] once and had been to, I think it was Cincinnati [Ohio] you know but had been it.
Speaker 1: So did you go the National Baptist Convention gatherings?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your church was a member of the, was it the Progressive National Baptist [Convention] or the National Baptist?
Speaker 2: I think it was the National Baptist you know, whatever the black Baptist, large black Baptist group was at the time.
Speaker 1: It was probably the National Baptist Convention I guess, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 253220
Speaker 1: So in high school [Mirabeau B. Lamar High School, Houston, Texas], now what did you focus on course wise in high school?
Speaker 2: Well the, the great thing about it in addition to the regular course work they had what they called advance placement courses.  And, and they really pushed you in those.  And so I took like advanced placement history, advanced placement chemistry and one other advance placement course maybe a math related course.  I took a lot of you know geometry, trigonometry, calculus, I took biology.  'Cause I had given some thought in high school that I might wanta be a doctor, but I disabused myself of that notion by the time I got my senior year.  'Cause I didn't you know like the sight of blood and I didn't you know didn't like the idea of you know of having to always being around sick people, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you think at that time you would want to become a lawyer, at that time, were you thinking about that (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I, I had given some thought to it because one person who was you know was really well known in Houston [Texas] was a judge, [HistoryMaker] Judge [Andrew L.] Jefferson [Jr.].  And you know by the time I met him he was actually off the bench in, in private practice.  But he was like one of the larger that life figures in Houston at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you have any at that time when you where, when you were coming along in school or at church people every talk about the Sweatt verses Painter [Sweatt v. Painter, 1950] case down there (unclear).
Speaker 2: Not a lot, no I mean I learned about that later on?
Speaker 1: Okay, I just wondered, so when you were on the verge of graduating I supposed that you, you probably had some college offers I guess for scholarships and things (simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah I did, because I a, I think it was a National Achievement [Scholarship] finalist.  And I got a lot letters from colleges.  And you know I really made a conscious decision that I wanted to go away to college and not stay in Texas.  'Cause a lot of folks in my senior class were going to University of Texas [at Austin, Austin, Texas].  Which is very intriguing because it was a lot cheaper than a lot of the out of state alternatives.  But I just wanted to get away, not only from home but also just get away from the state you know and try something new.
Story_ID: 253221
Speaker 1: You ended up going to Duke [University, Durham, North Carolina] right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But how did you make a decision to go to Duke that, you know--?
Speaker 2: It was interesting you know like I said I got contacted by a whole lot of colleges.  And the person who was in charge of minority recruitment at Duke you know sent a form letter and the first line of letter says, "Please don't throw this letter away because it's a form letter."  And so that really caught my attention and I was fortunate you know in high school [Mirabeau B. Lamar High School, Houston, Texas] I had a black guidance counselor who was very helpful in helping my sort through you know all of the different choices.  'Cause again no one in my family had graduated from high school and certainly no one had gone to college.  So, this was all virgin territory for me.  And you know just to, to think through the issues that you had to think through in terms of what colleges would make sense.  And one you know big factor for me was I had to be careful about where I applied 'cause there was always like a thirty dollar application fee, and we didn't have a lot of money.  So I would always try to get that application fee waived.  And if I couldn't get it waived it really said you know you gotta be very judicious in terms of where you're gonna apply 'cause there's a real economic consequence you know to submitting that application.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so you applied to, did you have to pay fee to apply to Duke?
Speaker 2: I don't remember, I doubt it I probably didn't, probably didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did what was your conception of Duke in those days, now this was 1973?
Speaker 2: Seventy-four [1974] when I, well I, I graduated in '74 [1974].  What is interesting they had a summer transitional program that they invited you know maybe 20, 25 black students to attend.  And I decided to do that because you could pick up a couple of credits.  And you know I didn't have the opportunity to visit Duke before I decided to go there.  So I remember you know on the, the cab ride from the Raleigh-Durham [International] Airport [North Carolina] over to Durham [North Carolina] where Duke is located thinking I hope I haven't made the biggest mistake in my life.  'Cause I had made a decision of about where I was going to spend the next four years without having ever visited the place.  Didn't have a chance to really talk to anyone there, I was just making it based on, made a decision based on the reputation of the school, but had no idea if I'd like it.  So and it hit me as I was riding, you know, from the airport to the school, that you know I wonder if this is gonna work out, but it did, it did.
Story_ID: 253222
Speaker 1: Well what was Duke [University, Durham, North Carolina] like?  Now, this is a school that I guess hadn't been integrated that long I, I guess?
Speaker 2: It was actually I mean, it was actually a, a pretty good experience.  Because you know I lived on campus all four years and, and Duke had you know roughly ten percent of the student body was black.  And the black community was pretty close knit and really supportive.  You know so you know the upper classmen would take the freshmen under their wings and sorta you know guide 'em rightly or wrongly, (laughter), through you know the, the whole experience.  And you know I all four years I was at Duke I had work study jobs.  'Cause I had some scholarship money and fortunately you know I had to take out very little in student loans.  And I had these work study jobs, so it was pretty busy but you know I had a, a good time at Duke.  You know I was an accounting major and you know I really enjoyed that and I took whole a lot of you know traditional liberally arts courses.  I was in a fraternity and you know just had a really good college experience.
Speaker 1: Okay, now was there a black student organization on campus?
Speaker 2: Yep there was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you know I was very active in that all four years.  In fact I think it was either my junior year or my senior year I was the treasurer of the black student government that's what it was called.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I was you know I was active in that and I was you know active in the fraternity.  And you know work I you know was just hanging out with friends in addition to school work.
Speaker 1: Well what kind of jobs did you have on campus?
Speaker 2: Well I had, the, the, my, my most memorable year was my I think it was my junior year, junior and senior year.  I had two work study jobs that I was able to pull off a lot of time at that the same time.  I was the business manager for the Duke drama group.  Duke had two campuses the east and the west campus.  And the Duke drama group was in the east campus and right next door to the drama group was the music library.  And I was a record librarian so what I would do is I would stop by the, the drama place pick up all of the books and records, 'cause you know I had to a lot of bookkeeping.  Take all my stuff set up shop over at the record library.  'Cause as the record librarian I, I just handed out tapes and albums for folks who were taking music classes.  So I was able to kill two birds with one stone.  And my girlfriend at the time would go you know get food and bring it to me.  'Cause I would you know work five six hour you know shifts.  And you know so I had you know I was making money you know I'd get fed you know it wasn't a bad deal.
Story_ID: 253223
Speaker 1: Now, you're an accounting major now, but how did you become an accounting major, I think I mean what made you decide to major in accounting?
Speaker 2: Well it you know it was--I always loved math and when I made a decision not to do pre-med I didn't want to do like a pure math major, because I didn't see how you could make any money doing that.  'Cause when I went to college I was thinking about well when I get out I gotta make some money.  'Cause especially after my freshman year, 'cause like I said my father [Peter Hurst, Sr.] died the summer after my freshman year.  So I was focused on you know when I get out I gotta make some money.  So what could I major in that would you know would allow me to make some money?  And accounting you know was like you know something that was like a great combination.  Because you need to get a job and it really required a lot of math.  'Cause you know in addition to the account course, we had to take courses like statistics, operations, research, account-a-metrics you know so you know it was a good combination for me.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you envision yourself going back to Houston [Texas] after you graduated?
Speaker 2: I did in fact my senior year I interviewed at that time Big Eight and now it's just three or four of 'em, but all of the Big Eight accounting firms.  And my plan was to you know stay at home you know get job with one of the Big Eight accounting firms and you know save all my money.  'Cause I didn't plan on paying my mother [Ophelia Richardson Hurst] any rent (laughter) but those plans got waylaid.
Speaker 1: Now you graduated (unclear) magna cum laude, (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yep, Yep
Speaker 1: Yeah right, right so you were (unclear) one of the top students in the?
Speaker 2: Well I guess the Duke [University, Durham, North Carolina] had a level above magna summa.  But you know it was I, I think as I recall there were only two black students graduated magna, myself and a woman name Georgia Dent [ph.], who went on the medical school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I, you know I always took school seriously.  You know took it seriously when I was in junior and senior high school [Mirabeau B. Lamar High School, Houston, Texas] and took it seriously when I was in college.  You know so I had a good time, but I always made sure I took care of business first.
Speaker 1: Okay, now once again who were the teachers and people on campus that, that you remember that were the most helpful to you?
Speaker 2: That's interesting I don't know if there was any teacher that made a big impact.  But there was a, there was a faculty advisor named Dr. Joseph Bathay [ph.].  Who was a, he's minister and you know he made a big impact.  And you know just in terms of more mentoring, in terms of you know what to expect from school you know and what to expect from life.  'Cause I think you know every place I've been those kinda lessons to me were probably more important than the academic pursuit.  Is finding someone who could talk you through you know what you needed to know and expect about you know life in general.
Story_ID: 253224
Speaker 1: When you graduated what, what was your--what had you anticipated being your move.  Now you, you had thought about going back to Houston [Texas] but what, but what happened? Did you go (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  Well what happened my senior year my dean called me in and I guess he had some conversations with the folks at Duke Law School [Durham, North Carolina].  And he asked me if I had ever thought about going to law school, which I hadn't.  You know cause again I was focused on getting a job to make some money.  So you know he had me talk to the dean at law school and you know they offered me a scholarship.  And you know the conversation made me think about you know that maybe I oughta apply to some other law schools.  And I did you know and applied to several law schools.  And, and I was on a track to go work from a Big Eight accounting firm.  I had actually started my, you know spring semester senior year to study for the CPA [Certified Public Accountant] exam.  And I got into Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], so and I still not totally convinced I was going to do it.  But you know a good friend of family, act someone, actually someone that my mother [Ophelia Richardson Hurst] work for wrote me letter and said you know really gotta go, if you got into Harvard Law School you really gotta go.  So you know I put off the whole plan to go to, to the Big Eight accounting firm and went to law school instead.
Speaker 1: Now was it, was it, were you kind of surprised that you were admitted to Harvard or did you have, (unclear) you know?
Speaker 2: No, was I 'cause again I hadn't really, you know thought about law school my first three and half years you know college.  You know I was really thinking about you know I was going to you know graduate in accounting go get a job make some money.  So you know I hadn't really thought about it and I hadn't really thought you know, you know what a significant thing at the time to get into Harvard.  But you know I remember you know I still remember when I got the acceptance letter I was just in shock.  And you know it's just something that 'cause I seriously after my father [Peter Hurst, Sr.] died, I actually seriously thought about dropping out of Duke [University, Durham, North Carolina] and going back to school in Texas.  You know we just didn't have money.  You know so to go from thinking about, you know, bagging Duke to you know getting into Harvard Law School was really you know a big transformation for me.
Speaker 1: Okay so this is a opportunity that's too big to pass up, so you had to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  Right.
Story_ID: 253225
Speaker 1: How'd you like Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: I didn't like the weather because you know it was cold, it snowed a lot and law school is not you know a warm and fuzzy place.  But you know the one good thing about it it's a very intense atmosphere and some of my closes friends in life I met at Harvard Law School.  You know the guy who's my best friend, the guy who you know he's the godfather to both my children.  I'm the godfather to both of his children.  He was the best man at my wedding, I was in his wedding.  You know I was stood by him when his mother died.  He stood by my side when my mother [Ophelia Richardson Hurst] died.  You know I met (unclear) at the law school, and one of my closes females is someone that you know I met at Harvard Law School.  Couple of my friends that I met in law school are investors here in the bank.  You know so there was some very intense relationships that have lasted a long, long time.  So you know even though law school wasn't a warm and fuzzy place you know, I think that you know some of the people who mean an incredible amount to me today are folks that I met there.  And it was a great experience in the sense that you know I remember sitting around in class my first year and saying to myself who know these people are going to run the world in future.  And some of them are, I mean some of the folks who were my classmates and you know at, at Harvard Law School are.  You know are in senior position in the government, they're running corporations they're running businesses, they're you know in academia, so they've all done incredible things, in addition to practicing law.  And you could just tell that you know these are a lot of very bright driven people.  And I really you know used to pinch myself when I, you know, thought about I was in that environment.
Story_ID: 253226
Speaker 1: Was there any time when it got particularly tough when you thought you might not wanna finish, or (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No it I mean it was always tough, but I guess the biggest you know moment of fear for me came like maybe two or three weeks before graduation when I got a letter from the registrar's office that I owed 'em six hundred dollars and you know I, I didn't have the six hundred dollars and didn't know where I was going to get it from.  And my mother [Ophelia Richardson Hurst] and my godmother were about to make plane reservations to come to graduation.  And so that was probably the scariest time for me, was you know trying to figure out you know how was I gonna get that money to graduate.  Because you know that was obviously a big day for me and for my mother you know, so?
Speaker 1: So but you worked it out?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: What, what happened how did you work it out?
Speaker 2: Actually this guy that my mother worked for you know sent me the money.  You know and this the same guy who talked me into going to Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] in the first place.  He was a lawyer and you know, you know to this day I really appreciate what he did.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's interesting kind of dynamics, so your mother actually worked for this, this guy who advised you to go Harvard (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right and, and what the significant of it he was a University of Texas law school [University of Texas at Austin School of Law, Austin, Texas] grad and that's a really big deal in Texas.  And so for him to you know you know strongly recommend that I go to Harvard, you know really made me you know sit up and take notice.  Because this was the guy that lived and breathed the University of Texas law school.  And he was recommending that you know that I go to Harvard Law School.  'Cause I'd applied and got into University of Texas and gotten a scholarship so you know financially it would have been a lot easier to go to University of Texas than to go to Harvard.  But the fact that he really made such an emphatic point that you know I had no alternative no choice I had to go Harvard you know and had a big influence on me.
Speaker 1: Okay, well so you graduated with a, in, in 1980 (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Eighty-one [1981].
Speaker 1: Eighty-one [1981], okay, okay and that's with a Juris Doctorate?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right and so what did you do next?
Speaker 2: I actually spent the first year after law school clerking for a federal judge [HistoryMaker Damon J. Keith] in Detroit, Michigan.
Story_ID: 253227
Speaker 1: Well tell us about Judge Keith, now you this is [HistoryMaker] Judge Damon [J.] Keith in Detroit [Michigan], the federal judge, and you were?
Speaker 2: Yeah he actually, I interviewed with him my second year of law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And he decided to select me as one of his law clerks for the following year.  And you know other than my parents [Ophelia Richardson Hurst and Peter Hurst, Sr.] I think he's probably you know one of the most significant people that have come into my life.  Just he was the best experience to have right after law school.  Because you know as a young lawyer you know you don't know anything you know even though you know you've through you know three years of law school.  So you know, you know learning from Judge Keith not only about the law 'cause you know I learned a lot from him about the law, but also just about you know life.  And how to treat people how the handle yourself, was just you know an amazing experience for me.  And you know it's one of those experiences where you know the judge had three daughters so all of his male lawyer clerks in effect became surrogate sons after the clerkship.  And I don't think there's been a major decision I've made in my life without either talking to Judge Keith or trying to guess what his reaction would be.  So (unclear) you know real significant you know person and, and just you know it was, it was a year where I learned so much about the law.  And learned so much about you know how to treat people and it just watching Judge Keith in action.
Speaker 1: Okay you so that aspect of it really seemed to have affected you, how, how you treat people no matter what their station is?
Speaker 2: Well, in, in not, not only how you treat people but also how you carry yourself.  But that I mean the Judge was and is you know one of the bravest people I've ever met and most principled people I've ever met.  You know it was very clear what his positions were on issues like you know civil rights, constitutional law and you know he never wavered one bit.  And in terms of the way he treated people you know the Judge would walk down the street and obviously he knew all of the power brokers in Detroit--I mean Coleman Young was the mayor of Detroit when I clerked for the judge-so you know all of those folks were his friends.  The folks who were the senior folks at GM [General Motors Company] and you know they were all his friends.  But he would also know by name the guy who cleaned the toilet, you know the guy who sweeping the street.  And he would speak to those folks as respectfully or even more respectfully than he would you know the power brokers.  And that was just who he was it wasn't an act it was genuine.  And you know so I learned a lot just watching Judge Keith in action.  And you know he really did you know passionately care about Detroit and he passionately cared about black people.  And made no bones about it and you know it was just you know wonderful to see a man like that up close.  Because you know the, the public you know version of Judge Keith was very close to the private version and it was just the most amazing thing to see it.  And you know the way he would you know even you know treat lawyers who appearing before was so respectful.  You know and you know I just learned a lot about seeing how people responded to that.  You know if, if you could treat someone with respect or treat 'um you know shabbily, you would always get a much better reaction if you treat 'em with respect.  And you know it's a real important lesson.  Because you know the whole warm and fuzzy thing it's not something that they emphasize in law school.  But it's a very important you know in terms of, you know, your relationships with other people.  Whether they're at the same level, above you or below you in terms of how you treat folks.
Story_ID: 253228
Speaker 1: Can you remember the cases you all were working on when you were clerking there?
Speaker 2: Yep, a lot of, you know, significant cases that we worked on.  But I guess one of the most significant things I saw during that year, the Sixth Circuit [U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit] sits in Cincinnati, Ohio, so like every six weeks or so we would, you know, you know go down to Cincinnati, and have like three days of hearings.   And I'll never forget there was a social security appeal, a lot of cases you never write opinions on, they, they just, the lower court decision gets aform- affirmed on order.  But there was a, it was a social security appeal where a woman had applied for social security benefits, had been denied and, you know, she had appealed that denial.  And you know so they would always send, you know, a lawyer from the social security to represent the government.  And I'll never forgot this, you know, the lawyer was making his argument and [HistoryMaker] Judge [Damon J.] Keith leans over smiles and said, "Excuse me sir, but I just have one question for you, does ice water run through your veins?"  And the lawyer just said, "No judge, I don't want to appeal this case I agree with the woman's position but they're their making me do this."  And I just thought that was the most amazing thing.  That, you know, he didn't brow beat the guy, didn't say it in a nasty way he just said it very you know succinctly, very matter of fact and the guy just cracked (laughter).  So I mean  we, we dealt with a lot of very important cases during my year with the judge, but that one incident, you know, stands out in my memory, as to you know what the Judge was all about you know.  And, and how he did things because he essentially in open court you know with a stenographer present got a lawyer to just throw away his whole position (laughter) with a simple question, so.
Speaker 1: That's quite a story though--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that's a--yeah.  That's a story you'd have to hear from somebody else other than Judge Keith about his--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 253229
Speaker 1: I mean the other thing is the Judge [HistoryMaker Damon J. Keith] was very involved with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and so he would always make a point of getting his law clerks tickets to the [Fight for] Freedom Fund Dinner, which was a huge event in Detroit [Michigan].  And you know one of the most amazing things for me, you know as a young graduate from law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts], was just you know being in a town black folks had so much political, economic and other power.  And you know it was so matter of fact that they had the power and the way they carried themselves.  Because the Judge would always take you to these events where you would see judges getting swore in, you would you know see lawyers getting you know promoted to the bench.  You would see business people who had these very successful businesses and they were all people of color and the Judge knew them all.  So it, it was just like a really amazing time for me and a amazing town.  And I guess the only reason I didn't stay in Detroit, it was just too cold, it was one of the coldest places I have ever lived.  It was start snow in, in around Thanksgiving and you wouldn't see you know the ground until May.  And that was just too much for me.  But you know, but for the, the climate issues I would have definitely considered staying in Detroit.  It was just, really an amazing city at the time.
Speaker 2: Yeah during that time period, I mean there were some economic issues and so forth but the, but the politically climate was upbeat, I remember that, people talk about it.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: There's a question, oh yeah the Freedom Fund Dinner now just for the record I mean, how big is this I've, I've heard it's huge (unclear)?
Speaker 1: When I was there I'm trying to remember the name of this hall where they had (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Cobo Hall [COBO Center, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Cobo Hall, they would, it was so large you would have to have a large screen at that time, so that you know someone could see the speaker.  And, and they would have the entire place sold out.  They would have tables set up and the entire place would be sold out.  And you know the Judge would always make sure we had tickets 'cause you know law clerk you making next to nothing.  They pay a lot more now but at the time it seemed like it was next to nothing for me.  And you know the Judge would always make sure we had tickets and it was just the most amazing thing to see.
Speaker 2: Okay, they would have like three podiums going on at the same time, I mean that's what I heard I've never been to it but?
Speaker 1: Right, no it, it's huge, it's incredible, I mean just the visual spectacle is something to hard to describe.  Because the, the Cobo Hall itself was so large and to you know have tables you know in every inch of the place.  And have all those tables filled you know it's not like some events I go to now where you know someone buys a table and maybe four or five people show up for a ten person table.  If there's a ten person table they had ten people at each table.
Speaker 2: I know I've heard, I don't know if anybody has documented it scientifically but it's the largest dinner probably in the country in any one sitting (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it wouldn't surprise, me.  It wouldn't surprise me at all.
Speaker 2: It's all to benefit the NAACP I believe?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 253230
Speaker 1: So well you left Detroit [Michigan], when did you leave Detroit, I mean--?
Speaker 2: September of 1982.
Speaker 1: Okay and what did you, where did you go?
Speaker 2: Went to a law firm in [Washington] D.C.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was the name of the firm?
Speaker 2: Steptoe & Johnson [LLP, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right now what happened there?
Speaker 2: I stayed there a couple years, did international work, some antitrust and some banking.  And left there in '84 [1984], to go to the Federal Reserve Board [Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System] in the general counsel's office.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you worked for the Federal Reserve Board as the, in the general counsel's office.  Now how long did you stay there?
Speaker 2: I stayed there two years, (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Two years okay.
Speaker 2: And I, I was there like at an incredible time there was a whole lot changes going on in the banking industry.  And you know we were in the middle of a lot of you know really interesting transformations.  And you know dealt with a lot of interesting issues.  And because I come there after being at a law firm and having a clerkship you know I got a lot of responsibility, a lot of very interesting work and you know really enjoyed it.
Story_ID: 253231
Speaker 1: Now, you seem to be you know drawn towards financial matters all along you know.  So where, where did you go after, now you left Federal Reserve Board [Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System], what is it in '86 [1986]?
Speaker 2: Eighty-six [1986].
Speaker 1: Eighty-six [1986], okay.
Speaker 2: In '86 [1986], I left the fed I switched from law to investment banking.  I got married and I left [Washington] D.C. and moved to N.Y. [New York] all at the same time.
Speaker 1: That's a lot of activity in.
Speaker 2: All at the same time (laughter) so.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how did you, you know decide, well I, I can see the transition now you're in Federal Reserve Board then you decide to go into investment banking, but, but what were the specifics of that decision?
Speaker 2: Well you know I wanted to practice law, but I was not committed to spending the rest of my career being a lawyer.  And you know with accounting background and since I'd had the legal background at the Federal Reserve Board you know it game me the opportunity to do investment banking.  Because when I went to you know I went to E.F. Hutton [& Co., New York, New York].  And I went into their financial institutions group, which was responsible for, for banks and thrifts you know don't merger and acquisitions transitions, corporate financial structuring work.  So the accounting was definitely valuable and having the legal background at the fed was valuable you know.  It made that transition pretty easy, because you know you really had to understand the regulatory frame work in order to, to execute a merger and acquisition transition or a corporate finance transaction.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so how long did you work for E. F. Hutton?
Speaker 2: I was there about three years and then I Hutton got acquired by Shearson Lehman Brothers.  And I went to Dean Witter [Reynolds] and Dean Witter went into their financial institutions group and you know basically doing the same thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Except the difference was at Dean Witter you know I went in at a higher level and I had you know responsibility for new business development.  You know and I focused on banks and thrifts in New England and in the Midwest.  So you know we did a lot you know in Connecticut, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and I did a lot in Ohio.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm not much of a business mind but what are the highlights of this kind work (unclear) I guess?
Speaker 2: For me you know it was, it was really exciting because it combined the finance and the accounting and the law.  And you know and, and the best thing about it was that you could create your own transitions.  You'd you know would come up with an idea that you know bank A ought to buy bank B and you could go talk to them, someone about you know whether or not they wanted to hire you to do that.  Or you could say you know this bank ought to raise money through a common stock offering or convertible preferred offering or a debt offering.  And you could go talk to 'em, you know pitch 'em on the idea and try to get hired to do that.  So I, I thought that was always you know the, the best part about it.  You didn't have to wait for someone to pick up the phone and call you and say I need to do X.  You could come up with an idea, develop the idea and go to try to sell a potential client on doing it.
Speaker 1: Okay so you had a chance to use your initiative and creativity and okay, all right so how long, now you were at Dean Witter in '89 [1989] I guess.  Right, you started in '89 [1989] is that--?
Speaker 2: Eighty-seven [1987].
Speaker 1: Eighty-seven [1987], okay and so you were there like how long?
Speaker 2: Until 1990.
Story_ID: 253232
Speaker 1: All right in 1999--in 1990 you, you did what?
Speaker 2: I left and went into business for myself.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Basically doing the same thing.  And you know but focusing on smaller deals, smaller clients.  In fact the first client I had when I left Dean Witter [Reynolds] I was representing an investor group that tried to buy a bank up in Hartford, Connecticut.  And you know so it's the same kind of work I was doing just a different environment.  So I did that for about eleven years.
Speaker 1: Okay and what, what was the name of your firm?
Speaker 2: It was called Hurst Capital Partners [Inc.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And before that there was a, a version of the same, doing the same thing called Bahia Partners [Inc., New York, New York].  Where I along with a guy I worked with at Dean Witter we actually tried to buy a couple of banks unsuccessfully.
Speaker 1: Now why did you call it Bahia Partners?
Speaker 2: Well my, my business partner had you know Cuban and, and Brazilian in his background he spoke fluent Portuguese.  I like Brazilian music and Brazilian food so we wanted to a name that was really unique.  And (unclear) as you may know the Bahia region of Brazil is where most of the black folks live.  So it was a way to you know, just have a very unique name, we didn't want to have our respective names in the name of the firm.  So you know it was a way to you know to come up with something that was something that was pretty unique but had you know an additional significance for us.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right that makes sense.  So did you get, get a chance to go to Bahia at some point during?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Haven't been yet.
Speaker 1: All right, okay but that didn't last that long and then you went and then formed Hurst Capitol Partners right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right and that lasted for eleven years right?
Speaker 2: Well actually the eleven year period included time with Bahia Partners as well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right okay.
Speaker 2: So I would say Bahia probably lasted maybe three, four years during that eleven year stint.
Story_ID: 253233
Speaker 1: Okay, so that takes us to 2001?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I guess and so what, what happened in 2001?
Speaker 2: Well actually starting in October of 1999, I started talking to Fleet [Financial Group].  They were merger with BankBoston and they had to divest in branches for antitrust reasons.  And a former law, law firm colleague of mine a guy who I worked with at Steptoe & Johnson [LLP, Washington, D.C.] was at the firm that was representing Bank of Boston. And he knew at to divest these branches for, for antitrust reasons so he asked me if I, I was interested.  So I actually started talking to them at October of 1999.  You know we did due diligence I put in a couple bids.  And around Thanksgiving of that year they selected me as the winning bidder had we started negotiating a contract.  So from like Thanksgiving until early January we were negotiating a contract.  We made the announcement like you know the second week in January that you know that I'd won the bid to, to buy these branches.  And you know for the next year I focused on you know raising the additional capital I needed to, to get the transaction done as well as getting regulatory approval.  And so my you know my background as a bank regulatory lawyer was real helpful in putting together the applications to get regulatory approval.  And my background as an investment banker was real help too in raising the money.
Speaker 1: Okay what and so you didn't find it difficult to raise the money (unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh it was very difficult it took a year, took a year, it's probably the hardest thing I've ever done.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because it, it sorta like trying to stuff an octopus into a paper bag, you know 'cause I had to get regulatory approval and raise the money at the same time.  And so the regulators are saying well where's the money.  And the investors are saying well you know do you regulatory approval.  So you know I felt like a tennis ball, you know being batted back and forth.  But ultimately it all came together and we opened the doors in February of 2001.  So we actually we're about to have a fourth anniversary on the 23rd of this month.
Speaker 1: Okay, so now was the name Community Bank [The Community's Bank] all, already I mean?
Speaker 2: No I came up with (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You came up with the whole.
Speaker 2: I wanted to have a name that you know symbolized what I thought the opportunity was.  And that's to have a connection with the places and people where we were doing business.  So you know it's the Community's Bank.  So you know the significance is the community in some respects owns bank and you know has a vested interest in whether or not the bank will be successful.
Speaker 1: Okay now the symbolism oak tree it looks like is a what, what's the significance of that symbol?
Speaker 2: Well that's you know, that's a very prominent symbol in the State of Connecticut you know the old charter oak.  And for me, you know, it was a, you know, sort of a tongue in cheek take off of the notion that money doesn't grow on trees.
Story_ID: 253234
Speaker 1: What's been the history of [The] Community's Bank [Bridgeport, Connecticut] since you opened up, how, how have you done?
Speaker 2: Well we've done well considering the tough interest rate environment.  You know we've had all of the challenges that you have with any new business.  We've had turnover you know trying to find the right people.  We've actually gotten out of certain markets because we just found it was you know too difficult to, to operate a small institution in, in.  Essentially when we started the bank in three cities and so we're now just here in Bridgeport [Connecticut].  Because we found it was very difficult to have the kind of control you need to have operating in three different markets.  And we were fortunate there's another institution up in the Bloomfield [Connecticut] market.  Because when we started the bank we had branches in Bridgeport, Bloomfield and Hartford, Connecticut.  And we were fortunate that you know there was an institution that really wanted to be in Bloomfield came along and made us an offer we couldn't refuse and we took it.  So that you know 'cause it was just very difficult trying to manage you know for a small operation like ours you know a branch environment in three cities.  And especially when you know Bridgeport is about sixty-five miles from Hartford, I'm mean I'm sorry from Bridgeport.  And you know it's about 50 or 60 miles from, from Hartford.  So you know now we're just here in Bridgeport and you know we're really known here.  Because what we're trying to do is you know, you know do banking the way it used be where you know we emphasis customer service.  We know our customers, our customers know us, you know the decisions are made locally.  We're active in the community all of those you know sort of corny things that bankers and community banks used to be known for we're trying to bring that back.  But we also have a lot of the modern you know aspects of banking.  We have online banking, we have online mortgages, we have telephone banking, we have ATM's.  We have you know Visa debit cards you know.  So we got you know the combination of the new technology and the old way of doing business.
Story_ID: 253235
Speaker 1: So are most of your depositors and clients [with The Community's Bank, Bridgeport, Connecticut] in the African American community?
Speaker 2: No it's, it's interesting you know if you look at our customer base and if you look at our work force is just like America.  In terms of diversity we have client who are Caucasian, Hispanic, African American, Brazilian, Portuguese, Asian American.  And our workforce you know we have you know African American, Caucasian, Hispanics, Cape Verdeans, Asian Americans you know it's just a really diverse work force, and a real diverse customer base.  Because Bridgeport [Connecticut] is a very diverse city, you know Hartford [Connecticut] was as well (unclear).  Bridgeport has a population of about 140,000 the make us is about a third African American, a third Hispanic and about a third Caucasian.  So you know because of we where situated we're play to all over those different communities.
Speaker 1: Okay then they all other groups you mentioned they're you know they I guess they, well there are a lot of this is a diverse place.
Speaker 2: Well you know, it's interesting in I, I heard a statistics last week in a presentation was being made and the Bridgeport public school system, sixty-seven languages are spoken.  So that gives you an idea of the diversity of Bridgeport.  In fact we have you know people on our staff that you know we have one person for example that speaks English, Spanish and Portuguese.  And you know and also you know we have you know a Haitian guy on our staff who you know speaks Creole and French, you know in addition to English.  So you know we can do business with just about anyone in Bridgeport, worth doing business with.
Story_ID: 253236
Speaker 1: What significant projects has the bank [The Community's Bank, Bridgeport, Connecticut] supported, you know, in the community, would you--?
Speaker 2: Well two things. Let me describe--we're designated, when I say we both the bank and our holding company.  Our holding company is called the Urban Financial Group.  We're designated by the U. S. treasury department [U.S. Department of the Treasury] as a community development financial institution.  Which means that both the bank and the holding company have, as our primary missions, community development.  Which doesn't mean we're doing bad loans it just means the kind of you know market Bridgeport [Connecticut] is and the kind of things we're doing as a bank will by definition improve this community.  Because we're focusing on you know residential real estate loans which you know enhances and supports homeownership.  We're focused on doing commercial loans which enhances and supports entrepreneurship.  So, you know, because we're a community development financial institution a lot of our lending activities qualify for something that the treasury department has called a bank enterprise award.  Where it's, it's almost like a Discover Card you get cash back for lending that you've done in certain markets.  So based on our lending activities in Bridgeport, Hartford [Connecticut] and New Haven [Connecticut] respectively, you know, we got an award earlier in our fiscal year, our fiscal year starts July first and ends June 30.  So October we got a bank enterprise award of over $300,000.  So, you know that's an example of, you know, something that, you know, the bank directly does in, in fulfilling its mission of lending that's had a positive impact.  We also support a lot of causes and, you know, like I'm active on a lot of local boards of directors.  And the bank is, you know, supported things like there's an organization in town called The Music and Arts Center for Humanities [sic. The Music and Arts Center for Humanity, Bridgeport, Connecticut] and every year they have a show put on by the Ailey II traveling production.  And we support that by buying tickets for kids in Bridgeport schools to go to that performance.  Because the theory is, is that, you know, a significance cultural event, the kids wouldn't have the money to go otherwise and, and you know we want to support that.  I've done things like they, they have a read aloud day and I go, you know if not every month, every other month to a school here in town that's on the, you know, one of the poorer sections of town call the Newfield School [Bridgeport, Connecticut] and I read to a group of first grades.  And I actually went you know last Thursday and read a Langston Hughes book, you know signif--you know in significance of, you know, Black History Month.
Story_ID: 253237
Speaker 1: Okay we were talking about some of your community activities and you're on the boards of quite--you're on the board of quite a few organizations in town.  And I don't know if I should mention this now but you were the also the ringmaster for the 2004 Barnum [Festival, Bridgeport, Connecticut] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Festival, yep.
Speaker 1: --Festival, right here.  And you know so well it's, it is becoming like this small town you envisioned, here you're become a.
Speaker 2: Well it's almost like you know all of the community activities are almost part of the job.  Because you know what separates us [The Community's Bank, Bridgeport, Connecticut] from the larger banks is that you know I'm you know the visible face of the bank.  And so when I'm doing these things it's not only because I wanta make a positive contribution, but it's also good for the bank to be perceived as a community oriented institution.  Because you know the bank is really nothing more than the collection of the people who work at the bank.  And I'm the leader of the bank so when I'm involved in an activity it, it really you know sends a big statement.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah you said the, the makeup of this town is like its third black and a third Hispanic most, mostly Puerto Ricans right?
Speaker 2: Yeah Puerto Ricans are the largest Hispanic group and there also is a large Mexican population here as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right that's interesting 'cause I didn't know that, that there are that many Mexicans this far east yeah.  Chicago [Illinois] has a huge Mexican population.
Speaker 2: Yeah that right, that's right, as well as Texas where I grew up.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, that is, that was Mexico (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right (laughter).
Speaker 1: --at one time so they actually belong--you know, were there first actually, yeah.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Story_ID: 253238
Speaker 1: What are the future plans of the bank?  Are there any big projects cooking?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we actually, since we sold our branch in Bloomfield [Connecticut] which is in Hartford County [Connecticut] back in September 2004, we've been looking at opening additional branches here in the greater Bridgeport [Connecticut] area.  So we, you know, got a number of sites that are under study right now.  We're about to get into the business of selling insurance products.  And we hope to have that online in about three or four months.  And we're trying to get into the asset management business.  You know through a joint venture with another firm, where we would sell a cash management services to institutional clients.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what about your own per--, personal goals, (unclear) what's your future, did do you see yourself doing this for a long time?
Speaker 2: I, I think so although you know I've, I've given up trying to predict the future.  I, I really enjoy what I do, I love coming to work every day.  It, it's different because this is something I created.  You know in my more reflective moments you know I sit back and think that The Community's Bank [Bridgeport, Connecticut] is here today because of me.  Because I took you know incredible risk and you know made a lot of sacrifices to get the bank off the ground.  It, it literally took me eighteen months from the time I had the first meeting with, with Fleet [FleetBoston Financial] until we opened the doors in, in February 2001.  And you know it was a lot painfully times a time where you know I was under a lot of financial stress but you know it ultimately got done.  And you know we're you know alive and kicking and doing well you know four years later you know after we opened the bank.  And you know so it's really different when you know it's something you created.  You know there've been tough times, there've been a lot challenges, a lot of long hours, some sleepless nights.  Because you know I have other investors that I brought in and I want to make sure that everybody you know does well at the end of the, the day.  But I also have you know a responsibility to, to my employees and ultimately to my kids 'cause now my kids will be the primary beneficiaries of whatever financial success I achieve with the bank.  So you know there's a lot of you know there's a lot riding on this doing well and, and I'm a person who, you know I do things to win, not to come in second.  So you know, things are, are--I mean with God's help and a lot of hard work going well.
Story_ID: 253239
Speaker 1: When you look, well, when you look at the community you, well when we came in we were talking about you being the, the ringmaster or the central figure for this Barnum Festival [Bridgeport, Connecticut]
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you said this is the first time an African American had ever been the, the ringmaster for this in since fifty-six years.
Speaker 2: Fifty-six years.
Speaker 1: Right, in a city that's a third African American?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, what, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well two things and they're both interrelated, and well let me say three things.  I think, when I look at, and I and when I think about the community I seldom just think about the African American community.  I used think about the African American community and the Hispanic community.  Because I think you know if you add those two communities together you have two thirds of the population in Bridgeport [Connecticut].  And when I think about you know what's going on right now, the things that trouble me the most public education.  The school system here is, is not good at all, we have twenty-one failing schools in Bridgeport.  Bridgeport, like most towns in Connecticut get most of their money for public education from the state and the funding system is flawed so that on a per student basis Bridgeport gets less than the other urban areas.  The, the dropout rate is just astronomical.  So you know public education is a real big concern for me because it really affects a whole lot of you know African American and Hispanic children.  The second think that, that you know I worry about here in Bridgeport, it is an affordable city in terms of housing, but there's not enough affordable housing and something has to be done about that.  And the third thing is access health care.  You know we just had a meeting today while we're doing this interview with our insurance providers so that folks can make their, you know insurance selections for next year.  And you know the amount that the bank [The Community's Bank, Bridgeport, Connecticut] has to contribute has gone up dramatically and the amount that our employees have to contribute has gone up dramatically.  Yet we're all fortunate that we even have insurance because we have a job.  And when you think about the people that don't have insurance and what they're doing to try to get adequate health care.  And it, I'm, I'm sort of sensitive to this issue because I'm on the board of you know one of the local hospitals here.  So I see you know how the hospitals are responding to people who can't afford to pay and it's, it's scaring.  I mean so you know all these issues in my view are interrelated.  Because you know for every guy like me who's you know doing well financially running the bank, you got people who you know don't have health insurance.  Who, you know whose kids are you know are not getting a good education in the public school system.  People who don't have you know decent housing.  So you know until the least of the folks among us are doing as well as the best among us, you know I, I got some concerns.  And I got, that, that, that really is a big concern for me.  'Cause again it's not the African American community here in Bridgeport, it's also the Hispanic community.
Speaker 1: So it's--and those two I would guess would comprise the lowest income group in the city, I guess.
Speaker 2: Unfortunately, if you did an analysis that's what you would see.
Story_ID: 253240
Speaker 1: Now when you look back at the things that you've been able to do so far, it's not easy to establish, to have found a bank and to do what you've done.  Is there, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: Probably start it at a different time.  Because you know one of the significant things about when we started the bank [The Community's Bank, Bridgeport, Connecticut] it was a period of historically low interest rates.  And banks tend to make more money in a higher interest rate environment.  So our economic engine is a lot stronger right now than it was in February 2001.  But you can't control that you know we had to start it when we started it.  But if I could you know do anything differently that would be one thing I would do.  You know in terms of you know what a community focus bank does, we're doin it and I'm excited about that every single day.  We don't make loans that we shouldn't make, but you know we really do you know give people an opportunity to have access to credit.  It's sort of like when I clerked for [HistoryMaker] Judge [Damon J.] Keith.  I knew if he had anything critical to say about my work product it wasn't because of racism it was because I had not done a good job.  And now if someone of color comes to me for a residential real estate loan or commercial loan and we turn 'em down.  You know I can look 'em straight in the eye and say look you know you didn't get turned down because of racism, you got turned down because I didn't think you were a good credit risk, end of story.  And so it's, it's good to be in a position where people you know feel like they can come to a lending institution and get a fair shake.  'Cause I, I make no promises that I'll loans to people and businesses that shouldn't get loans, but if you should get it we're gonna figure out a way to do it.  So, you know if you think about you know one of the things that people of color and, and businesses owned by people of color have had to deal with and that's a lack of access to capital.  One of the things you do with a bank is you provide capital to people and to businesses.  So you know that, that's something that just based on what makes us money is also having a, you know, ancillary benefit of, you know, making this community stronger.
Story_ID: 253241
Speaker 1: Can you tell us a story of a, of a business I mean that really that, that you were really able, some business person, you were really able to help that was really successful, or story or stories, and then one that was not?
Speaker 2: Well let me, let me share two different types stories 'cause I'll focus on the positive.  There's an African American entrepreneur who we actually had a, a line of credit out to.  And I got a call on a Saturday morning eight a clock, I was reading my, my paper and I was having the first cup of coffee and I almost spilled the coffee on my lap because I wasn't expecting the call.  And he was calling up to say look I got this opportunity with a major you know Fortune 1,000 corporation to increase the business I'm doing with 'em.  But I need to increase my line of credit and I need to increase like it you know like yesterday.  So you know after I you know sort of pulled myself together from you know (laughter) getting this unexpected phone call, you know I told him what he needed to do to get the loan approved quickly.  Gave him the phone number of my loan officer who you know personally would be responsible for the account.  And you know we actually got him the money and he got the business and he's doing well.  Another example it's you know not a business loan but this is something I probably feel you know the best about this is the single best story I got since we started the bank.  Guy at my church [Mount Aery Baptist Church, Bridgeport, Connecticut] a few years ago called me up on a Friday he said I really gotta talk to you.  'Cause I go to a black Baptist Church here in Bridgeport [Connecticut].  And I said what do you need to talk to me about he said you know we really gotta restructure a lot of stuff you know we're drowning.  So I said alright you know, so I had you know one of my people agree to meet with me and this guy and his wife the next day.  And I'm sitting there and he's telling me the background of you know of his situation.  And I'm literally scratching my head and almost putting my head in hands saying I don't know what we're gonna be able to help this guy 'cause it looked pretty bad.  But you know we did get something done we refinanced his mortgage.  He paid off a lot of credit card debt.  And you know the next time I saw him a church you know he gave me the biggest hug.  I mean he's probably you know one of the few guys at this church that's actually taller and bigger than I am.  And he almost lifted me off the ground and, and then he wrote an email to me thanking everybody that was involved in the process and commenting on how professional and supportive they were and I still have that email.  And that, and that was a great story because you know he's done other business with us, and you know every year things get a little better for he and his wife.  And you know I feel real good about that.  Because  you know what we do is we're not just providing banking products 'cause our banking products are like anyone's products but we're also provid--, providing some advice.  You know we're trying to play it straight with people give 'em advice that makes sense for them and not just sense the bank.  And I think people you know respect that and they appreciate that.  And, and that something that you know, we wouldn't you know be able to do that if we weren't here.  If, if I was you know just working for a big bank I couldn't take the time.  You know to, to respond to someone calling me you know Saturday morning saying I really need to get the money by the next, by next Wednesday.  'Cause you know the big bank decision probably be, be made out of state.  But you know I knew this guy and I knew his you know company and you know I could make a decision.  And, and the story about the guy at my church you know just going the extra mile, it's something we do, it's just that's our competitive advantage.  'Cause you know we can't compete with the big guys in terms of convenience 'cause they have these extensive branch networks they've got a lot more capital than we do.  And we don't want to compete on price 'cause they could kill us.  'Cause they could price us out of business in a day.  So we're trying to compete based on service.  And, and again in every single case because you know I'm a major shareholder every time we make a credit decision, we're looking at it like we're lending our money out  'cause we really are. So we don't take any unnecessary risk but, you know we look at folks and they know that they can get a fair hearing here at The Community's Bank [Bridgeport, Connecticut] and I feel really good about that.

Speaker 1: You've been the recipient of numerous awards in fact we saw you--that's how we picked up on you.  I think we saw you on a website as, as one of a number of recipients of a community award here.  When you look back on what you've been able to do here, and you're still young, you know by most, by our interview standards (laughter) what, what would consider at this point to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well it's funny I, I really don't focus a lot on awards.  I think that probably three things so far I'd like to be known for.  One is you know certainty starting this bank [The Community's Bank, Bridgeport, Connecticut] I think was a major achievement for me personally.  And the second thing is I try to do a whole lot in the community.  I do a lot of things that people don't even know about in terms of you know, you know trying to serve as a role model for kids.  And trying to make time for kids that you know I don't want anyone to know about it 'cause I'm not doing it for press, I'm not doing it for any attention.  And then the third thing is just you know, I'm trying to you know as a divorced father you know help raise my two children.  So you know those are the things that are, that are really at this point in my life part of my legacy.

Speaker 1: Did your mother [Ophelia Richardson Hurst] get a chance to see you graduate from law school [Harvard Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and all that?
Speaker 2: She did, she did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother and my godmother in fact.  And my mother saw me graduate from college [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina].  She saw me get married, she saw you know both of my kids get christened.  She didn't live to see me start the bank [The Community's Bank, Bridgeport, Connecticut] though, so that's, that's one thing that she didn't get to see.

Speaker 1: Is there anything we need to talk about that we haven't mentioned, that's sig--that significant before we ask our last question?
Speaker 2: I think, I think we've covered a lot.
Speaker 1: I know we, we always find we leave something out.  But you know it's, but if there's nothing else our last question is similar to legacy but it's a little bit different.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  I think that and, and it's really ironic for someone who's in the business of dealing with money and obviously started the, the bank [The Community's Bank, Bridgeport, Connecticut] to make money, not only for myself but my other investors.  But when it's all said and done, I don't want to be known for making money.  I'd like to be known as someone who made a difference by showing leadership.  And leadership in my view is the courage to you know say and do the right thing at the right time.  I'd like to be known as someone who gave of myself to make you know my community better.  And my community is not just here in Bridgeport [Connecticut] but it's also you know throughout the State of Connecticut.  And, and you know on a broader basis you know the region of New York, and, and Connecticut and Massachusetts.  And I'd like to be known as someone who you know always tried to do the right thing.  I am very proud to be an African American.  You know I've never wanted to be anything else for a whole host of reasons.  And I think that you know the mere fact that you're here today and we're here today is to me such an incredible thing.  Because you know I never would have contemplated you know when I was a kid growin up that I'd would be sitting you know here today with someone would think whatever I have done and am doing is significant enough to you know come talk to me about it.  And you know every single day I, I always ask myself the question, what I'm doing the decisions I'm making, the way I'm, I'm trying to live my life.  Is this something that my parents [Ophelia Richardson Hurst and Peter Hurst, Sr.] would approve of?  So and every single day if the question is answered in the affirmative, I'm feeling pretty good about myself.
