WILL HOGGARD:  Okay.  I&#8217;m here at the Cup of Joe coffee shop with Miss Barb Smalley which is one of the, I want to say second in command of Ladyslipper.  Is that correct?  BARB SMALLEY:  That&#8217;s, yeah, that&#8217;s I don&#8217;t have any, yeah.  I&#8217;m really sort of like the, I&#8217;m the babysitter for Ladyslipper.  I don&#8217;t have&#8212;  WH:  All right.    BS:  I don&#8217;t work full time anymore.  I keep an eye on things when the founder goes away.  WH:  Yes ma&#8217;am.  All right.  Yeah.  And I&#8217;m just going to ask a few questions about your role with the founding of Ladyslipper and what have you I guess done since you&#8217;ve been in there that you feel like really has had a big effect on the women&#8217;s movement through North Carolina and Chapel Hill in relation to music and stuff.  So&#8212;  BS:  Okay.  Okay.    WH:  Well&#8212;  BS:  Do you want me to just&#8212;well, here&#8217;s Ladyslipper music was started in Laurie Fuchs living room in 1976 in Durham, North Carolina.  But I didn&#8217;t come along until 1990, and I moved to the Triangle to, specifically I lived in Carrboro, and I was a graduate student in sociology at UNC.  And one of the first things I did when I arrived in town was I got, I got hooked up with, there&#8217;s a lot of history here.  Anyway, I got&#8212;I    went over to--there was a new lesbian like community center called Our Own Place on Watts Street in Durham.  And I went over there one June afternoon and hung out and just met a bunch of women who were, who were hanging around, and that afternoon I wound up joining a soccer team that was just forming.  And on that soccer team were a number of women who were working full-time at Ladyslipper Music.  And I had heard of Ladyslipper when I was just coming out back in the mid [19]80s.  There was a thing called the National Women&#8217;s Mailing List, and I was living in Philadelphia, and I don&#8217;t know, somehow we all got on this National Women&#8217;s Mailing List and we would, we&#8217;d get, the mailing list would be sold to different organizations that were looking to do marketing nationwide or whatever.  So sometime in the late [19]80s I remember getting a Ladyslipper music catalog in my little apartment in Philadelphia and at that time&#8212;  WH:  This is before you are even a part of&#8212;  BS:  Yes, I was living in Philadelphia working for the Girl Scouts.  And that was my first real job out of college so I was probably in my mid-twenties.  Got a Ladyslipper catalog, and I just couldn&#8217;t believe it.  It was just, I mean what in the world is this.  And I was just coming out as a lesbian, and it was like who knew there was such a world of people working just to compile this music, and anyway it was a whole new world.  So anyway that&#8217;s how I first learned about Ladyslipper.  So I got the catalog while I lived in Philadelphia.  So then I moved to Durham, no I moved to Carrbor,o and I joined a soccer team.  And on the soccer team, a couple women who worked at Ladyslipper played&#8212;Chris Header and her girlfriend Diane whose last name I forget.  But they both worked at Ladyslipper.  One was the wholesale manager, Chris, and I think Diane was the retail manager at the time.  But so we played some soccer games, and oh and also another woman Erin Yeng played.  I think she was playing at the time.  She also worked at Ladyslipper in the wholesale department.  So by and by I was playing soccer on Saturdays with these gals and living in Carrboro, and Chris said to me one time, &#8220;Do you want to do some part-time work sometime at Ladyslipper?&#8221;  And I said, &#8220;Well sure, what do you have?&#8221;  She said, &#8220;Oh just a couple of hours a week.&#8221;  Ladyslipper had just computerized and it used to be that they would handwrite out everything, handwrite out the orders and pack them and then handwrite the invoices and send them out to the stores that they were selling music to.  And, but after they got computerized things got a little backlogged because, which is kind of funny because you think it&#8217;s supposed to become more efficient.  So the first thing I did I would go over a couple of afternoons a week.  I would find my way, you can probably relate to this.  I would find my way from Chapel Hill over to Durham to the Ladyslipper office, which at that time was on Vickers Avenue.  T hey had just moved from West Chapel Hill Street, a little office there, to a slightly larger building on Vickers Avenue.  And I would put the, I would print out these invoices on a dot matrix printer, and I would separate them.  Then I would put them in envelopes, and then I would file the yellow copies in the file of customers or no I guess I would put them anyway until they got collected.  And that was my big contribution to the world of women&#8217;s music for a while.  And then I was in graduate school for five years, and I just, throughout those five years I just wound up doing any assortment of things off and on at Ladyslipper, packing and shipping, going to festivals, women&#8217;s music festivals like in the summer and selling music at our booths that we had.  And during the holiday season I would have more time on my hands than school hours so I would do more.  So but I was just sort of an hourly wage worker for those years.    And then in 1995--I came here in 1990.  In 1995 I finally departed graduate school without a Ph.D.  I finished a master&#8217;s, but I didn&#8217;t get a Ph.D.  I sort of wandered around, and thought I might go back to Philadelphia.  And, but I didn&#8217;t, and actually it was kind of funny.  I guess what I wound up doing is that&#8217;s the same summer that Ladyslipper moved from Vickers Avenue to the building that I showed you that we bought that building in the summer of 1995, fixed it up and made the move that summer, or maybe it was at the end of that summer.  And so I worked to help with the move, and then I just really didn&#8217;t know what I wanted to do with myself.  Graduate school had kind of taken a lot out of my hide and some family stuff had come up along the way, and so I, so I [background coffee store noise] (                ) job at Ladyslipper, and I was I think the first thing I did I was [background noise from coffee shop]  I forget how loud that coffee (                ) can be.    So my first full-time job at Ladyslipper was as a wholesale sales rep.  I had maybe 120, I don&#8217;t know maybe more accounts, stores, bookstores, new age stores, and I think at the time there were three of us in that department.  And we were in the new building, and it was a very exciting time.  I mean there were probably, I would say there were at least twelve or fifteen full-time employees at that time.  And the thing about me is I didn&#8217;t know a whole lot, I mean, I knew as much about music as sort of our average customer knew.  But what was really attractive to me was the whole idea of working with a group of women in this small organization.  And those were just some great years.  I mean people were, it was just a bunch of really witty, creative, fun loving women, and we had plenty of drama because we worked together and we socialized together as well.    WH:  You mean drama like&#8212;  BS:  Oh yeah, you know, affairs and break ups.  So we were really kind of an extension of the broader lesbian community.  And there really, there, I mean there are very few towns, well, there are very few towns like Durham and there are very few towns where you could find a pretty healthy, a pretty healthy lesbian community and significantly large lesbian-owned, run small businesses so that your work life and your social life--.  There are just not that many women who had that opportunity.  And it was funny because a lot of customers would call us up and just always assume that it was a big party going on.  But the fact is we did work pretty hard because it was sales oriented.  The retail folks had to deal with all kinds of&#8212;I mean, there were times the phones would just ring off the hook with mail order stuff.    I&#8217;m trying to remember when we went up on the internet.  This was like 1990.  There were no internet sales.  The internet really kind of broke the, like the World Wide Web right, really kind of broke open in the late [19]90s.  I forget when we, it just hasn&#8217;t been as long as you would think.  Now it&#8217;s just like a major--but that happened in those years too.  We got our website up and got a lot more business that way.  WH:  Do you feel like all the business sort of (            ) brought I guess like a broader view of what you guys were doing as far as the Triangle is concerned.  You feel like you got a lot of recognition throughout all of Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill?  BS:  Well, that&#8217;s a really good question because Ladyslipper has always been kind of a national and even an international presence that happens to be located in Durham, physically.  And but there was, there was a time in say the early years in fact I&#8217;m not sure and you&#8217;ll have to ask Laurie this when you talk to her what year it was actually when Ladyslipper decided to stop doing local production, concert production.  Because for many years Ladyslipper was a local concert producer.  WH:  You mean concert like&#8212;  BS:  Like performers like&#8212;  WH:  Like unplugged performance you record that or like&#8212;  BS:  No, just live performance for local, it was for the local audience.  So it was like, there was the international catalog and then when these women&#8217;s music artists would come through town, Ladyslipper was often the producer for those concerts, and they would be held a lot of the time held in church basements.  Although sometimes I think there were some over at Page Auditorium at Duke.  I mean there was a time when they were quite large.  Laurie can tell you the story about producing Joan Baez.  So Holly Near who may not be familiar to you, but she&#8217;s fairly prominent in the peace movement, and so and then some of the label artists like Kay Gardner and (            ) I&#8217;m not sure.  But there came a point where, and actually I think this was while we were still in the old building on Vickers Avenue.  There came a point where Ladyslipper had to look at the finances, and it was like pick one thing or the other.  You can&#8217;t make the, print and mail this catalog, which is a huge amount of upfront money and do the concert production.  The thing that almost any producer will tell you is that you can lose a lot of money really fast doing concert production.  And the, that&#8217;s what was starting to happen.  It just wasn&#8217;t really, for Ladyslipper it was just one or the other and&#8212;  WH:  How did you lose money?  I guess you--  BS:  Well, with concert production you lose money when you have too many, too many overhead and upfront costs.  S o these days one of the big costs is just renting the hall and say you want to put on a concert at the Carolina Theatre.    WH:  Oh I get it.  I get it.  BS:  So you&#8217;re renting the hall; you&#8217;re paying the sound people.  You&#8217;re sometimes having to rent the sound equipment.  And then you&#8217;re, and then you&#8217;re negotiating a contract with the artists for some either a flat fee plus a percentage or something like that.  So and then you&#8217;re just depending on this momentary, everything coming together in the moment, right, for your ticket sales to cover everything.    WH:  I got it.  BS:  Yeah, and so in something like the women&#8217;s music movement, there are some artists that are so obscure they&#8217;re just happy if you do a living room concert.  And living room concert of course your overhead is very low, and the income is pretty low, and you&#8217;re not necessarily paying a guarantee to the artist either.  So that&#8217;s kind of the safest thing but&#8212;you get to that mid-range like the church basement or the coffee shop level, and then maybe the artist wants a little bit of a guarantee, and then you&#8217;re sort of scaling it fro there.  So it&#8217;s like I guess, any sort of business you&#8217;re sort of, it&#8217;s a wager.  You&#8217;re waging a bet that your production is going to draw enough that particular night and that particular location.  WH:  So like with you guys know what you were doing, were you considering more so the big, I guess, national like international picture like the international scene more so than I guess just the close-knit&#8212;  BS:  I think as far as concert stuff and also what went in the catalog is that those, most of the artists who were actively recording and touring that sold best for us were the artists who were part of this kind of women&#8217;s music movement that was happening really coming up in the [19]70s and the [19]80s.  And even in the [19]90s, you could ask anybody about it but even in the [19]90s things, we were talking about this, as recording became sort of easier to do and being on somebody else&#8217;s label was less significant.  People were forming their own labels and figuring out their own distribution more.  I was also going to say the difference between concert production and selling recordings, in those days, a recording would cost maybe on average say maybe three times as much as concert ticket for that same artist.  Now you think about these days right, it&#8217;s really flip-flopped especially when you think about major artists that the recording costs next to nothing compared to a live concert ticket.  WH:  So you think that with the prices and stuff being flipped that has a lot to do with people getting more actively involved with the movement, as far as that is considered now as opposed to like then when concerts and getting a lot of people together wasn&#8217;t so expensive, you think that changed?  BS:  I&#8217;m not sure.  I think in the women&#8217;s music movement it&#8217;s more that it just kind of followed, the pricing just kind of followed the general trends.  I think in the [19]90s with recorded music and touring there was a lot of anxiety remember, people in the dot com boom and everything going online, people started fearing that nobody was going to leave their house anymore, right.  The bookstores started worrying about Amazon.com taking all their sales.  People not having this place to go and meet up and talk about ideas and that people wouldn&#8217;t buy music in the music shops anymore or for that matter go out and hear a live concert.  But the fact of the matter is that actually as far as, that may be true with bookstores and music shops.  But I think what&#8217;s been nice is live performance actually not suffered that much and has gotten better, production values have gotten better for everybody and that people are really thirsty to get out and hear live music still I think.  And even older people, I mean what amazes me about the scene for instance whether it&#8217;s women&#8217;s music or just independent music is that I mean, how many venues are there in the Triangle, any night of the week you can go out and&#8212;  WH:  That&#8217;s really good.  BS:  And there are people just hanging around drinking their PBR, people from like age fifteen to seventy.    WH:  Especially in Carrboro and Chapel Hill.  BS:  I know and sometimes I just think who are these guys who just still go out every night and listen to live music.  But it&#8217;s pretty cool.  WH:  Yeah, that is, that&#8217;s good.    BS:  It&#8217;s not necessarily true in the women&#8217;s music scene because of us are kind of getting older.  I always joke about this though.  The women who identify as lesbian will move here now and they&#8217;ll be like where&#8217;s this community?  It&#8217;s hard to find.  And I sort of think it&#8217;s because we&#8217;re all having dinner parties at home.  WH:  We&#8217;re reading a book for our class Finding the Women&#8217;s Movement  is the title and it said pretty much the same thing.  It&#8217;s like, I believe it&#8217;s in the introduction where they&#8217;re trying to look for the women&#8217;s movement, but it&#8217;s like right out, it&#8217;s right out in the open but at the same time it&#8217;s hiding.  I feel like that--  BS:  Yeah, I think here in this area we have, there are a lot of us.  And you can be connected in different, if you do a network&#8212;if y&#8217;all talk about network analysis at all.  You can look at who&#8217;s all, who knows who, very, it could be very interwoven, but there are still just tons of people that you never know.    WH:  So like looking back on everything that you guys did in Ladyslipper were you, like I remember yesterday we were talking and you said Miss Laurie, her goal was to get a catalog of all the different type of women&#8217;s music.  BS:  Yeah,.  WH:  Do you think, how do I want to say it&#8212;  BS:  Has that been achieved?  WH:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like looking back do you think the whole big goal was to&#8212;what am I trying to say.  I&#8217;m getting myself tongue twisted.  I can&#8217;t say it right, but do you get what I&#8217;m trying to say?  BS:  Well, I think, here&#8217;s what happened with her.  Is she went, she first got this idea of trying to catalog all recorded music by women.  She went over to Duke and just found almost nothing back in the mid [19]70s, and that&#8217;s where she started getting this idea to try to dig it all up.  So there was music by women and women&#8217;s music.  Kind of two separate but parallel tracks of endeavor.  That&#8217;s a really good&#8212;actually it&#8217;s kind of funny.  The answer is, I think I told you too that by the mid and late [19]90s we were getting so many submissions, what I&#8217;m about to say should probably not be archived, available.    WH:  I can&#8212;  BS:  No, no I&#8217;m just kidding.  But the truth is no, we did not catalog all music by women because there was many, many recordings where it just, we started as far as the catalog went, we started looking for what was commercially viable.  For us to go through all the business stuff of making a contract, bringing in a certain amount of product, putting it on the shelf, writing it up, putting it in the catalog, and trying to sell it, the artist had to be just either, just so amazingly good or have an audience already.  And so a lot of women and a lot of other recording artists in those days thought, oh I&#8217;ll make a recording and sell it.  That&#8217;ll be great and then I&#8217;ll tour.  It&#8217;s like no.  You have to tour.  You have to be, you have to get an audience first somehow.  Because people, even like total audiophiles don&#8217;t usually just listen to everything and buy one of each.  They just don&#8217;t.  Most people just aren&#8217;t going to do that.  So there are many recordings that were submitted to Ladyslipper Music and probably other distributors, independent distributors, that were listened to for a few seconds and then put in a freebie pile.  So no, we couldn&#8217;t possibly and there were many disappointed artists.  They thought that we were not living up to what we said we were trying to do.  They were like well, how, I thought you were trying to support women artists.  Why am I not in the catalog?  And I, some of us had to field a lot of those calls, and I used to, and even the artists who, I mean I think I said, if somebody sold 2,000 units in a year, that is, I mean for an independent release that is huge.  That is huge.  I mean we would typically when you manufacture like the label stuff, the minimum order would be 500 units.  And if we had a really successful release, we might manufacture 2,000 out the door and hope that we would sell those.  But a lot of things, just don&#8217;t, they just don&#8217;t move.  So there was a lot of, I used to say a large part of my job, besides fixing the computers, was managing expectations.  WH:  Yeah, so I guess going back to what we kind of talked a little about yesterday, you were saying like it was getting more commercialized or you, not more commercialized but you were picking more commercial stuff.  Do you think, because yesterday when we were talking you said it was, the majority of it was like politically based, right.  BS:  A lot of it yeah.  WH:  So the social issues--  BS:  Social movement based.  WH:  So the stuff that you started picking that was commercialized did you think it still had as much of a message trying to push forth through the music?  BS:  Oh yeah.  I don&#8217;t mean to say I guess I mean to say yes, we would pick artists who were still known as having a socially progressive, and it might be whatever, whether it was feminism or the peace movement or continuing the civil rights movement, whatever it might be that that would still be our focus.  Although there was, there were some artists that were just into doing love songs.  A few.    WH:  You still sell those, sell them.  BS:  Yeah, some of them.  If yeah, they weren&#8217;t like strictly political.  You might have like a really great torch singer type person who played piano and you just, for whatever reason just was very appealing.  Or some of the, an artist for instance Gwen Avery is an artist who just does some of her own stuff which is very, she&#8217;s a blues singer.  So she might do some old blues covers along with maybe some of her original more political type stuff.  WH:  On the same release.  BS:  On the same release, yeah.  Or here&#8217;s an example of an artist that is, I think this is probably a good example of an artist that Ladyslipper would of course want to promote but didn&#8217;t have a tight connection with and isn&#8217;t part of the women&#8217;s music movement.  Nnenna Freelon, okay so here&#8217;s, like I mean she in terms of like the kind of songs she does, they&#8217;re solid.  I think they often have a political awareness that&#8217;s not necessarily overt.  But and I think there&#8217;s something about just the way she presents herself as a singer too that is appealing to people with feminist sensibilities, and I&#8217;m not sure if I can quite put my finger on that.  But you know what I mean.    WH:  Yeah, I guess you&#8217;ve got to know her like and stuff.  BS:  Yeah, somehow, somehow, yeah.  WH:  Well, I guess like I looking back on all these experiences, how do you think like they shaped your life and what you feel about stuff and what you feel about the meaning that you get, that you get out of it now, like how it shaped you I guess?  BS:  Well, well, Will, here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to tell you.  I always had this little political itch growing up, and I always knew that I was not, I grew up basically in Columbia, South Carolina, and my parents weren&#8217;t real politically active, but they were pretty politically aware, and when I was in the fourth grade, court-ordered bussing came along in Columbia.  And about sixth grade because my parents didn&#8217;t participate in white flight in my neighborhood I was going to a school where there were just a handful of white kids.  And that continued to be the case through high school.  But at the same time I went to school with James Clyburn&#8217;s daughter, Mignon Clyburn, and he&#8217;s like pretty high up in the Democratic Party, congressman.  He was the PTA president, and my mother was the vice president.  So that was kind of my, that was, and I didn&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t think I had an interest in business so much.  I don&#8217;t know what I thought I was going to do.  I was very idealistic.  I wound up, I wound up getting a liberal arts degree from a school that&#8217;s kind of quirky where everybody reads the same books and just talks about them for four years.  No grades, that kind of thing.  So it&#8217;s kind of a philosophy degree basically is what people think of it as.  And then I worked for a while, and when I, when I worked for the Girl Scouts, I actually wound up losing that job because I was too out.  And I was run out of the Girl Scouts in Philadelphia by another lesbian who was freaked out by my youth and enthusiasm, and then I wound up in graduate school studying sociology because I kind of like to think about how people behave together.  And then I was becoming more politically active so working for an organization like Ladyslipper just was, it was just great.  Right.  It was like who knew.  So it was kind of an accident at the same time.  I mean somewhere midway through my graduate school experience I think I really didn&#8217;t, I realized I didn&#8217;t want to be a professor.  My undergraduate experience kind of ruined me for standard academic life.  It was very ivory tower-ish.  So then as I persisted at Ladyslipper and really, really I think the strengths I brought to it were my understanding of how organizations worked more than how the music industry work but just how any small organization might work and how--.  So I think I brought my sociology background to bear on my experience.  And I think it&#8217;s what allowed me to be the one to work with, to work alongside with Laurie who is a person that some people had a hard time working with.  I mean she&#8217;s very, she&#8217;s very strong-minded, and she keeps her eye on the bottom line, and that&#8217;s why Ladyslipper survived.  But I think I had the flexibility and insight and sense of humor to and the real passion for, for the work that to keep after it.  So that in the end there were three of us, and then there were two of us, and now it&#8217;s just her and me kind of on the sideline.    WH:  So Ladyslipper&#8212;  BS:  So it changed me but I guess what I was trying to say is that you never, so oh when I was in high school I was like Miss Everything.  I was student body president.  I was state honor society president.  I went to Governor&#8217;s School, and I was voted most likely to succeed and oh, and this is--.  Then the way like takes you.  It&#8217;s like my ambition was not to help run Ladyslipper Music.  It was all kind of accidental.  And I think that, I sort of laugh at myself now about how I may have been kind of a type A at the beginning.  But I think I found my strengths to be more in not my ambition but in my maybe insight.  And that, and just having an idea of how things really change and how the world does work and that being part of a cultural movement in some small way can make, can be very satisfying and make the kind of change in the world that you really want.  So that&#8217;s where I am now.  These days, like going over the building the other day and it breaks my heart sometimes.  It&#8217;s like there are ghosts and shadows and all these wonderful people who used to work there and&#8212;  WH:  The old Ladyslipper building.  BS:  Yeah.  Yeah.  But at the same time I think that we, it&#8217;s like what is, what&#8217;s the phrase we&#8217;re a victim of our own success.  I mean we, we did help open doors, open the world up for women to produce music and get it out there more prevalently and along with I think the, the lesbian gay rights movement just because--.  I think we were part of that too in sort of normalizing that kind of thing, that kind of thing where I think there&#8217;s some younger women who just, it&#8217;s like Ladyslipper, why would you even bother to do that.  Why would you have to do that?  Why would you have to have this separate catalog of--.  It&#8217;s like well, okay.  Just under forty years things have changed a lot.  WH:  Yeah, definitely.    BS:  A lot.  And I've been changed I think.  But I was talking about managing artist expectations, I think just working for a cause changes, it changes how you look at things.  Maybe you become a little more humble.    WH:  Yes ma&#8217;am.  BS:  How are we doing with time?  WH:  I think we&#8217;ve, it&#8217;s pretty long.  We&#8217;ve talked about thirty-four minutes.  But it doesn&#8217;t feel like it.  The time has flown by.  Let&#8217;s see.  Yes ma&#8217;am.  I just wanted to thank you so much for everything and I feel like this went pretty perfect, but is there anything else that you wanted to add?  BS:  No, I&#8217;m really enjoying getting to know you, and it&#8217;s fun to talk to you because I make all kinds of assumptions about what you think and what you know, and it&#8217;s like oh no you don&#8217;t.    WH:  Yes ma&#8217;am.  BS:  So it&#8217;s good.  It&#8217;s good.  WH:  Yes ma&#8217;am.  Well, thank you so much.  I appreciate it.
