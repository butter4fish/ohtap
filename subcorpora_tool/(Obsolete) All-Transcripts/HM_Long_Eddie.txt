Story_ID: 482764
Speaker 1: I'm going to begin with what I call People magazine-ish type questions.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I did have a favorite food.  It was fried chicken, but then I found out that it doesn't agree with me that well now as I get older.  So, (laughter) I have not found a number one food at this moment.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What about a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I think my favorite color is blue.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: My favorite time of the year is probably spring.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's not too hot and not too cold.
Speaker 1: And when you go on vacation, where's your favorite place to go?
Speaker 2: My favorite place for a vacation right now, I can't really talk about it, because what goes on in Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada], stays in Vegas (laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm noted for, while I'm preaching, to say, "Watch this, watch this."  So, that's kind of got attached to me now.
Story_ID: 482765
Speaker 1: Let's begin by talking about your family and your ancestors.  Tell me your mother's name, spell it for me, and tell me where she was born and when she was born, if you know.
Speaker 2: My mother's name is, her first name is Hattie, H-A-T-T-I-E [Hattie Alston Long].  We believe--well, my mother has dementia right now, so precious memories and things that we should have wrote down, is, is kind of lost, because most of my siblings have passed on also.  So, we believe she was born in Columbia, South Carolina.  We do know that her birthday is March 6th, but we never knew how old she is, because she was delivered by a midwife who never took and recorded her birth at the court.  So, we have a real challenge trying to figure out when she got to retirement age to get her social security.  And we, my dad [Floyd Long, Jr.], who's passed, said that my mom was older than him.  We're beginning to believe that, so we think she's somewhere between seventy-five and eighty years old.
Speaker 1: And what was her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Alston, A-L-S-T-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know any information about her parents?
Speaker 2: Her, her--my grandfather, his name was Hamp, H-A-M-P, Alston [Hampton Alston], and he had married again.  My mother's biological mother [Mariah Alston] died when she was young, probably about eleven or twelve.  Because my mother quit school.  She only went through the sixth grade, and then she had to take care of her mother.  And her mother passed, and my grandfather married again.  And for the life of me, I can't think of what my step-grandmother's name was (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: All I remember is that she liked to give me rice pudding (laughter).
Speaker 1: Can you go any further back?  Do you know any other history?  Your grandfather's father?
Speaker 2: On my mother's side?  No.
Story_ID: 482766
Speaker 1: Talk to me about your mother [Hattie Alston Long].  What did you know about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, basically what I knew about my mother is just that, again, she had a sixth-grade--she left school to take care of her mother [Mariah Alston].  And my mother's always been a caretaker from that point on.  Anyone who came to our house or who got sick in the family, on both sides--my mother's side or my father's [Floyd Long, Jr.] side--would come to the house.  And our guestroom had always had somebody that Mom was taking care of, or nursing back to health, or helping to get back on their feet.  She was a hard worker, a domestic worker.  She would take in people's clothes, and wash clothes and iron them.  She used to--we lived in Montclair, New Jersey for a while.  She worked for an attorney as their housekeeper and helped--kind of like in, 'The Raisin in the Sun,' [sic. 'A Raisin in the Sun,' Lorraine Hansberry] right; 'The Raisin in the Sun,' the movie.  She would just take care of their kids and keep the house clean, and then serve for parties for them.  So, domestic work.  She never had a driver's license, never, always caught the bus.  One reason, my daddy was a very jealous person, and he just didn't want her to be able to be that independent.  So, but, she worked very hard, and loved her children.  Just--I have three brothers, and we basically were her life.
Speaker 1: Before she got married and was growing up, you said that she stopped school to be able to take care of her mother.  Did they live on a farm, or did they live in the city?  Do you have, do you know that information (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They basically lived on a farm [in South Carolina].  My mother was an expert, I mean, on how to just take a chicken from the yard and behead it, pluck it, and clean it (laughter).  So, you know, they raised--they had a garden, a big garden, so all their food was fresh.  A certain part of the year, they would can the food and put it up, and those kinds of things.  Granddaddy [Hampton Alston] would slaughter hogs and sell some of it and, you know, there was the smokehouse.  So basically most of the food, other than, you know, little staple things, they raised and grew themselves.  And there was the rural outhouse, water pump, all those kind of things.
Speaker 1: Were there any stories that you can remember that she might have told you about a time in her life?
Speaker 2: Mama never really talked that much about stuff that went on when she was younger.  It was very difficult just finding out about my grandmother from her, other than she used to say that I reminded her of her, that's about it.
Story_ID: 482767
Speaker 1: Now, tell me about your father.  Tell me his name.
Speaker 2: My father's name is Floyd, F-L-O-Y-D, M. Long, L-O-N-G [Floyd Long, Jr.].  He's a junior, and he's a preacher, was a preacher.  He passed probably about ten years ago, I believe, somewhere in there.
Speaker 1: Where was he born?
Speaker 2: Again, in South Carolina, somewhere around Columbia [South Carolina] or something.  You know, our parents would never really talk to us about all that stuff (laughter).  We came up in the era that children were to be seen and not heard, and we were not supposed to ask a whole lot of questions.  So, we had to eavesdrop to find out various things.
Speaker 1: Do you know your father's date of birth?
Speaker 2: I know the month, it's June 12th.  I have to go back and look at the obituary and get the date.
Speaker 1: Tell me about his growing up.
Speaker 2: My dad, I did not really find out about my father's growing up until he had had a stroke.  And the reason being, my dad was a very strict disciplinarian.  He was a pastor, a preacher, and a businessman, and he worked most of the time.  If he wasn't working, he was at church.  And most of the time he pastored a church in a rural area, et cetera, so it was always a good distance to drive.  When it came to spanking us, whether we were right or wrong, he brought the justice.  Other than that, didn't have much conversation.  He never would come to see us in school.  All of my brothers [Floyd Long III, James Long, and Larry Long] and myself played football, and he never came to a game.  I was, I'm the first Long to graduate from college.  He never, he didn't come to my graduation.  And so one day when he had a stroke--because we were afraid of him.  You know, he had a stroke, so he was partially paralyzed.  And my daddy wasn't an affectionate kind of guy or anything like that.  I just asked him, you know, why was he so mean, you know, and stuff like that, because I knew he couldn't hit me.  I'm grown, and I'm still scared of him, man.  And then he started crying, and told me about when he was being raised.  And what happened was when his, when his mother [Mary Long] died, his father [Floyd Long, Sr.] made him--he was the oldest of about twelve--made him take care of all the kids.  My daddy worked hard and bought a car for himself, and his daddy took the car from him.  And so, my daddy was the provider for all his brothers and sisters.  And if he ever got anywhere and did anything, his daddy would take it away from him.  So, my daddy used to always say to us when we asked him for something, he said, "You got a roof over your head, and food on the table.  Leave me alone."  And basically, from his background, he was being a good daddy, because his father did not make sure he had food on the table.  His father did not make sure there was a roof over their head; that was his responsibility.  And so, I wept for him at that moment, and let go of all my anger.  Because I found that here's a man who's been going all these years and really was locked up, and wanted to love us the way, in a better way, but he felt that he was really being a good daddy based off of what he came through.  And so, that's kind of the history of him.  And it was unfortunate that it took him so long to kind of talk to us about it, but then I gave him his props based off of what he knew a daddy should do.
Story_ID: 482768
Speaker 1: Tell me about his parents.
Speaker 2: Well, his father was Floyd Long, Sr.  When I got to know Granddaddy, he'd kind of mellowed out, so (laughter).  And my daddy [Floyd Long, Jr.] honored and respected him still very much, because my daddy took care of him as he got--I think he died in about '80 [1980]-something.  And my daddy would always go over there and take care of him and make sure he was okay, and make sure his bills were paid and all of that kind of stuff.  And they became close as he was older.  But when I really got to know my grandfather, he was retired.
Speaker 1: What occupation did he have?
Speaker 2: Really, he was retired.  I don't know what (laughter) he did for livelihood, you know, because most of the time he was always home, you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: And where did they live?
Speaker 2: In Charlotte, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: And do you know whether they owned their own home?
Speaker 2: My daddy paid for the house that he was in.  He died in his own home, but my daddy paid for it.
Speaker 1: And what about your grandmother?
Speaker 2: My grandmother, both grandmothers, biological grandmothers, passed before we were born.  So he married again, and I'm trying to think--and don't ask me to spell it.  Her name was Lillie Mae [Lillie Mae Long] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did you have a relationship with her?
Speaker 2: Yeah, pretty much so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: She, this relationship--you know, again, from the era that we were brought up in, you know, when you go see your grandparents, you always had to be kind of quiet and just listen.  So, it was not this deep conversation kind of thing.  It's, "Yes, Ma'am, no, Ma'am," you know.  She always liked to cook, and she always liked you to come give her a big hug and stuff like that.  And then we'd go outside and play, that kind of thing.  So, it was a good relationship, if you look at it like that.  We enjoyed her, and she enjoyed us.  She wasn't getting on us about stuff that we was doing wrong or anything, because we know we'd better act right when we went over to Granddaddy's house, so.  And she seemed to be pleasant all the time, you know.
Story_ID: 482769
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your mother [Hattie Alston Long] and father [Floyd Long, Jr.] met?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think.  There is a story about it.  It's just that my mom tells the story that my dad--my mother used to work in a restaurant, and my daddy met her there.  She didn't want anything to do with him, and then she said people had told her, "Don't even give him a second look."  And she said every time she turned around, there he was.  And so he came over to her house and introduced himself to her daddy [Hampton Alston] and her stepmother and all of that, and was doing things for her father, and stuff like that (laughter).  He was just real persistent, and just finally he hooked her.  That's what I got to say (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, when your mother and father got married, where, where did they live?
Speaker 2: When they got married, I believe at first they lived in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Story_ID: 482770
Speaker 1: And you told me that your father [Floyd Long, Jr.] was a businessman and a preacher.  What business did he own?
Speaker 2: Well, he owned a Gulf service station, and he also owned a body shop, fixed cars.  He did that along with his one of his brothers, Harold [Harold Long (ph.)].  When they got married, my parents lived in Charlotte [North Carolina].  And there's a story about--my daddy was kind of an alcoholic.  And so my mother [Hattie Alston Long] just kind of, by her conduct, got him straight.  He wouldn't go to church, you know.  She thought he was saved, but he wasn't.  And so, she would dress up every Sunday morning and walk to church.  And, but she would make sure--one thing, my mother is from the old school.  She would--regardless of what--if my daddy came in at two in the morning, she'd get up out of bed and cook him something to eat and sit there and talk to him.  She, she, she, you know, she treated him very well.  And so she would cook him a big breakfast, go to church, and come back home.  So, she said after a while she would notice that he would start to get up out the bed and sit on the side of the bed and watch her when she would leave.  And then she said a little while longer, a few months later, he would get up and be up walking around the house.  And then she said a few more months later, she'd get dressed and fix him something.  And she said she'd put on her best stuff and go walk to church, and he'd be sitting out on the porch watching her walk to church.  And one day she got up, cooked his breakfast, went outside to go to church, and he was sitting on the porch dressed, and went with her.  And he got saved that Sunday, and stopped drinking and wanted to be a preacher.  And they moved to Tennessee, to Nashville, and he went to school to be a preacher and stayed there.  My two older brothers [Floyd Long III and James Long] were born in Tennessee, and then they moved back to Charlotte, and that's when I was born.
Speaker 1: Now in Nashville, do you know what school he went to?
Speaker 2: I don't have no (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You have no idea.  Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 482771
Speaker 1: And so, what year are we in?  Your, your two brothers, older brothers?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What year were they born?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm born in '53 [1953].  My oldest brother, I think he was born--well, my next to oldest brother was born in '50 [1950], and they were like a year apart.  So, if one's '49 [1949], then the other one is '50 [1950].
Speaker 1: What, what are your brothers' names?
Speaker 2: My oldest brother's name is Floyd, he's the III [Floyd Long III].  And then my next oldest brother's name is James, J-A-M-E-S [James Long].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And they moved back to Charlotte [North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: They moved back to Charlotte.  I was born, and six months after I was born we moved to Montclair, New Jersey, because that's back when the blacks started the Great Migration to the North for better jobs, et cetera.  So my daddy [Floyd Long, Jr.] loaded up the truck and moved to Jersey (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, how long did--how long were you in Charlotte before you moved to New Jersey?
Speaker 2: Me, personally, or the family (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 2: Me, I was six months old when we moved to Jersey.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, from six months old.  And so, you start school in New Jersey?
Speaker 2: I started school in New Jersey, and went to Rand School [Rand Elementary School, Montclair, New Jersey].
Speaker 1: Now, let me ask you about the neighborhood.  And since you were such a small child, you can't give us a comparison of living in the South and then moving to the North.  So, tell me about the neighborhood in which you lived in New Jersey.
Speaker 2: I can give you a little thing about what it was like moving back to the South.  So when I--because when I was raised in Jersey, in my community there were Chinese.  We were right next to the Chinese laundry.  Across the street there was an apartment building with mostly, full of Italians.  Behind me, us, was an apartment, and a community that was mostly African American.  So I grew up in a community of Italians, and Puerto Ricans, and Chinese, and African Americans, and whites (laughter).  So very much integrated, into various cultures.
Story_ID: 482772
Speaker 1: So the Rand School [Rand Elementary School, Montclair, New Jersey], it was of course an integrated school?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What do you remember about elementary school?
Speaker 2: I got picked on a lot, that's what I remember (laughter).  And my salvation was my oldest brother [Floyd Long III], because I would run to him.  I was a little scared fellow, I was a mama's boy.  And because we didn't have a lot of money per se, my mother [Hattie Alston Long] bought our clothes from a store named Pete's [ph.] on Bloomfield Avenue; I remember that.  And it was a secondhand store.  And so I used to get made fun of a lot, you know, by wearing--or what I didn't wear.  And people could, they could tell when you were scared, and so they'd pick on you a little bit more.  So, I'd get my brother to handle (laughter)--I ran home a lot.
Story_ID: 482773
Speaker 1: --You said you were a mama's boy.  Tell me about your relationship with your mother [Hattie Alston Long].  You have a very close relationship?
Speaker 2: A very, very close relationship.  I was--I don't know.  I understood--I just would watch my mom and watch how she sacrificed most of her life.  And I always--I don't know, I just kind of had a heart to make sure that I took care of her.  So when--I could see her when she used to come home.  She was very tired, and then trying to clean up, and all of that.  So a lot of times, I just took it upon myself that when I got home from school, I'd clean up the house.  As I got older, I not only cleaned, I cooked dinner and stuff like that.  I would, after a while, as I got even older in high school [North Mecklenburg High School, Huntersville, North Carolina] and stuff, I bought all my mother's clothes, you know.  I was working, and I remember she had took me to the doctor.  I was anemic, and the doctor made me--I had four jobs in high school.  And he made me--and played football.  And he made me quit, you know, some of my jobs, you know.  But I just was--you know, Mom wanted draperies or curtains or whatever, and I was always buying her stuff and doing stuff.  And so, in return, my dad [Floyd Long, Jr.] was very mean.  But when I got my driver's license and stuff, he would never let any of us use his cars.  But if I wanted to go out and he would say no to me, I'd go to Mom and just lay on, "Daddy won't let me use the car."  And she'd get up and she'd get on him.  "You'd better give that boy the keys," you know, and stuff.  And so, I'd look at the rest of my brothers [Floyd Long III, James Long, and Larry Long] and do something like that, you know, (gesture).  (Laughter) They didn't know how to take care of Mama.  Mama could get some things done.  But it was just, we just bonded.  I was her boy.
Story_ID: 482774
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of your friends or teachers from elementary school [Rand Elementary School, Montclair, New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: I can't remember how to spell this.  My third grade teacher was named Miss Boneno [ph.].  I remember that name, and I know she just used to like to pinch you when you were out of order.  I mean just really, you know, drive into you, et cetera.  And I think that's when I had my first real crush on a girl.  And that's why I remember her, because I was always kind of chasing this girl around the classroom, and she was always getting on me to chill out (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, thinking about memories, what is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: (Pause) My earliest childhood memory?  Wow, I don't know. That's a good one.  You mean something that just stands out?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, just, when you were younger, just--or when you were probably in elementary school.  Can you think of anything?  Or we can come back to that.
Speaker 2: We need to come back to that. That's a lot of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, that's fine.
Story_ID: 482775
Speaker 1: While you were in New Jersey, what type of work was your father [Floyd Long, Jr.] doing then?
Speaker 2: He was a preacher, he wasn't pastoring.  And then he pastored sometime, and then he was an assistant pastor.  And he drove a truck.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, his daily thing was driving a truck.  And he would, he would come home at five o'clock, eat dinner, and leave about seven and go drive again, and then come back home after work and sleep.
Speaker 1: Did you live in a house or an apartment?
Speaker 2: We lived in an apartment.  It was a kind of funny experience.  It was, what do you call them?  Duplex or whatever, you know, one apartment on one side, and another on the other side.  But upstairs was the Masons' lodge.  So whenever they were doing initiations, they would even take a billy goat up there and have people riding--I don't know if I'm supposed to tell that, but that's what they did (laughter).  But I remember just hearing all kind of noise.  And my daddy joined, and I remember him coming home feeling pretty sore, and all that stuff.  But it was quite an experience to live downstairs from the Masons, the Masonic temple.  (Laughter) That's basically what we lived in, you know.  Because upstairs it was kind of like an arena with podiums, and it was an amazing little set-up up there (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did you have an opportunity to see it?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, we used to sneak up there a lot.
Story_ID: 482776
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) My next question is what sounds, smells, and sights do you remember during that time [in Montclair, New Jersey]?
Speaker 2: It sounded like gang warfare going on upstairs during that time.  The smells that I remember is--just because--across the street the Italians lived.  And they--everybody had--the Chinese had the dry cleaners.  The Italians had the pizza place, and stuff like that.  So right across the street, I can just remember always smelling pizza and stuff, and Italian food when I came out.  And sometimes it would get mixed in with the Chinese food.  (Laughter) But I always was kind of smelling, you know, Italian.  And they were good people, you know, so I could go to them and get some good food free sometime.
Story_ID: 482777
Speaker 1: In elementary school [Rand Elementary School, Montclair, New Jersey], what type of student were you?
Speaker 2: I was a slow student.  Academically, it took me a while to wake up.  And my mom [Hattie Alston Long]--my dad [Floyd Long, Jr,] wasn't home, and my mom, as I said, dropped out in sixth grade.  So, it was very difficult for her to help me.  And so, I was an average student.  It just took me a while to catch on, for some reason.  And so, and that's the way my son Jared [Jared Long] was, and my wife [Vanessa Griffin Long] would get all worried.  But you know, I said, "He's like me, he'll get it.  One day he's just going to wake up."  And he's awakened now and stuff, and doing, you know, stuff.  So that's one thing I remember, just kind of being embarrassed.  And it took me longer than most people to get it.
Speaker 1: Was there a favorite subject that you, that you enjoyed more than others?
Speaker 2: I enjoyed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or that was easier for you, I should say.
Speaker 2: I enjoyed math, other than multiplication, only because they wanted to make you memorize those multiplication tables, and I hated doing that.  Adding and subtracting, I was okay.  Dividing, I was pretty good.  But when they started getting that multiplication, I hated it.
Speaker 1: Were there organized sports or extracurricular activities that you were involved in?
Speaker 2: I was in a play, 'Hansel and Gretel.'  You know, I'm embarrassed to tell this story.  But I was, I was, I was the star of the play, and ended up as the gingerbread man (laughter).  So that's, (laughter) you know, they gave you a script this long and stuff.  And I remember taking the thing home and laying it on the calendar, and never looking at it.  And then one day I came to school, and they said, "Okay, we're going to have, we're going to start rehearsing," and I didn't know my first line.  And the next thing I know, my teacher was so mad at me she made me a gingerbread man (laughter).
Story_ID: 482778
Speaker 1: --Did you go to junior high school in New Jersey as well?
Speaker 2: No.  We actually moved back to Charlotte [North Carolina], and I went to junior high in Charlotte.  And that was, when I went to Charlotte, it was like going back in time.  I'm used to a multicultural environment.  Wasn't no race issues, et cetera.  If we hated anybody, we just hated them because it was something that they did, not because of what color they were.  I went, I came back and went to an all-black junior high school, Northwest [Northwest Junior High School, Charlotte, North Carolina].  I had to walk like five miles to school.  Before, my school [Rand Elementary School, Montclair, New Jersey] was two blocks away, you know, and everybody--and so, that was--and then all the kids made fun of how proper I talked.  So that just, you know, messed with me, you know.  And again, I was still the little clothes.  My daddy [Floyd Long, Jr.] used to cut our hair every Saturday night so we could look good for church.  And he only knew one hairstyle, a kind of soup bowl hairstyle and stuff, and he'd skin our heads.  And so, we'd go to school and the kids were kind of mean in junior high, and they used to call me, "Eddie Lee Long Head [HistoryMaker Bishop Eddie L. Long]," and slap me in the head, because they just wanted to--you know.  I'm like, "No," and stuff.  So, but I really loved my teacher in the seventh grade, her name was Miss Phillips [ph.].  And Miss Phillips made--there was something about--I started to wake up to education.  She made learning fun.  She would make--we used to always have group tables and stuff, that's the way she had the room.  And everything was a game show.  She'd ask questions, and she'd be doing her arms like that, (gesture) "All right, who got the answer?"  "Oh, fifty points over there," and stuff like that.  And it was just, I just couldn't wait to go to class so I could answer a question and get points, and stuff like that.  She was always doing something new, and she was more than just a teacher.  She was like, became your mama and stuff like that, and really got involved in your life.  And so I think that's kind of what I needed, kind of like.  And so, I enjoyed that.  And then I was just getting used to all my teachers being black, you know.  And that's back in the time when they'd spank you in school with the wood, you know, in the South.  I remember my math teacher, Mr. Bill Pullens [ph.], he was one of the coolest people I'd ever seen in my life.  He had just graduated from college I guess and got his teaching degree, and may have been teaching a couple of years.  But people would brag if you got a whipping from Mr. Pullens.  You know, Mr. Pullens was just somebody to get whipped by (laughter).  So, I do remember that.  That was--it was--and then I only was there one year, and then they started bussing people.  And I was bussed to Rand School--not Rand, Ranson Junior High [Robert Lacy Ranson Junior High School; Ranson Middle School, Charlotte, North Carolina], which was predominantly white.  And that was like a good ways from my house.
Story_ID: 482779
Speaker 1: That's when I started playing sports [at Robert Lacy Ranson Junior High School; Ranson Middle School, Charlotte, North Carolina].  My--I was in gym, and I was just running track in gym.  And my--the football coach noticed how fast I was, and had me go out for football.  And then I ran track, and that's how my sports career started, and that's when I started really gaining more confidence in me.  The only problem I had at that school was Mr.--put this on tape--Mr. Douglas A. Hogwood [ph.].  Mr. Douglas A. Hogwood was the guidance counselor.  And this is back in the eighth grade when they'd give you these aptitude tests, and they're supposed to determine how far you can go in life.  And I remember him calling me in his office and asking me what I wanted to be, and I told him I wanted to go to college and be a lawyer.  And he looked at me and said, "Well, according to this test, you can't go to college, so you need to forget that.  Forget being a lawyer. What does--," he asked, what did my father [Floyd Long, Jr.] do?  I said, "He's, my father is a pastor and a mechanic."  And he said, "Well, that's about the best thing you probably could do.  You know, so why don't you just start looking at that?"  And so, here's the problem.  Miss Phillips [ph.] and them woke me up.  He killed me.  From that point on, I figured I'd just label myself dumb and I couldn't go to college.  So, what kept me in school was playing sports.  And I became the class clown, because I wasn't going to try to really--academics, what was that for, you know?  And so, I went through most of the rest of my school.
Story_ID: 482780
Speaker 1: Went to high school at North Mecklenburg High School [Huntersville, North Carolina] I enjoyed that, but really didn't try to put forth academically.  I did my senior year, was president of the student council; I don't know how I did that.  It was mostly off of popularity and all of that stuff versus academics.  But in the same vein, one person messed me up, and another woman, in my senior year, right at graduation, grabbed me.  Her name was Mrs. Chapman [ph.], she was a guidance counselor.  And she asked me, what am I doing?  And I said, "Nothing."  And she said, "Are you going to college?"  I said, "No, Ma'am."  She said, "Why?"  I said, "I'm too dumb to go to college."  And she said, "Oh, that's a bunch of crock."  And she pulled me in her office, filled out papers to North Carolina Central University [Durham, North Carolina], and filled out things for me to go and take the college test.  I think I got whatever you get to put your name on the paper.  And the next thing I know, they accept me.  They had a special program for marginal students to see if they can--whatever.  And I was selected.  And so, just her saying I can, and him [Doulas A. Hogwood (ph.)] saying I can't--I always try to tell teachers and others, and even when I do baby dedications, I talk to the grandparents.  You know, you can say one word, one sentence, that can alter your daughter or your granddaughter's life.  So, make sure you study your words that you say to them, because you can put them on the right road or cause them total destruction.  And just in a few moments this woman changed my life, and in a few moments that man changed my life, just by the words that they spoke.
Speaker 2: Now, let's figure out the years.  What year were you in junior high school [Robert Lacy Ranson Junior High School; Ranson Middle School, Charlotte, North Carolina]?
Speaker 1: Let's see.  I graduated from high school in '72 [1972], 1972.  So I was probably in high school--
Speaker 2: In, in '1969?
Speaker 1: Yeah, '69 [1969] (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 482781
Speaker 1: So it was junior high school then.  Well, actually, it was elementary school [Rand Elementary School, Montclair, New Jersey].  I want to talk about the '60s [1960s] a little bit before we get to the '70s [1970s], to see what was going on in the town, and even in the lives of the people in your family and community.  In the '60s [1960s], a lot of things happened.  Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was killed, and Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  Do you remember anything about the '60s [1960s]?  I know when Kennedy died, you were probably ten.  But what do you remember about that time?
Speaker 2: I remember when President Kennedy was shot.  We were in the library.  And it was amazing, because I remember maybe a minute before he was shot, I was pointing at the clock saying what time it was, because we were supposed to be moving to-- And I said out loud, it's such and such time.  And the next minute or so, an announcement came over the intercom that the president had been shot.  And then they turned the TV on, and I remember watching it.  And then they dismissed school.  Everybody--and so we were running home, because the kids were--we were crazy, and we thought the Communists were coming to kill us and all of that, and we were going to--you know, so that was the rumor that was out.  You know, Mama [Hattie Alston Long] and them were at work, and we ran home.  I stayed on Baysford Road [ph.] next to my uncles and my aunts, you know.  All of them lived around us and stuff, and nobody was home.  We was hiding under the beds and stuff, just scared.  The end of the world had come because of that.  But it was very, that was a very traumatic day, a very sad day.  I can almost remember it like it was yesterday.  Everybody was unsure about things.  And--
Speaker 1: Were your parents involved in the Civil Rights Movement at all?
Speaker 2: No, no, not at all other than glad somebody was fighting (laughter).  But we never marched or got into all of those things.  My dad [Floyd Long, Jr.] was a very hard worker, and mostly preached hell and damnation fire sermons, and kinds of things like that.  But I do remember the Kennedy assassination--
Story_ID: 482782
Speaker 1: I remember Martin Luther King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] assassination.  I remember watching the riots on TV, and stuff like that.  I remember (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What were your thoughts about that, about King?
Speaker 1: Just--
Speaker 2: And about the riots?
Speaker 1: King's assassination was like one of your relatives just got killed; it was not like the president [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy].  The president--you know, this was like your uncle, you know.  This was the end of hope.  It was--you know, because before that, you know, I remember the night Malcolm X was assassinated.  I followed that stuff even while young, very much so, and it's still like yesterday.  Because it was just kind of shaky--shaky times.  And we were still going through the identity thing.  I remember when James Brown came out with the song, 'Say it Loud, I'm Black and I'm Proud.'  And I can remember there was more of a kindred kind of family relationships in the African American communities.  You'd see somebody, "Hey, right on."  You know, "What's going on?  What's happening?"  And, "Brother," you know, all this stuff, which is not like that today.  I remember going from colored to black, and finally moving into being African American, you know.  People were trying to figure out what to call us, and we were trying to figure out what to be called, you know.  (Laughter) So, we weren't having the problem with the N-word, we were just trying to figure out whether we was colored or whether we was black.  And then there were struggles that were even within the African American community back then, where the light-skinned blacks thought they were better than the black blacks.  So we had all kind of stuff going on back then.  So the light-skinned folks got more favor than--
Speaker 2: Was there an incident that you can talk about?  Or was that, are you talking in general (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well that, in general, but mostly, even in school, you know, the light-skinned girls were quote unquote (air quotes), the girls, you know.  And so, we had this struggle.  You know, I'm dark-skinned, et cetera, so you decided well, you don't qualify to talk to them, or you don't--all those kinds of things.  So, there was a mentality that just kind of went through the community.  If you were this, then you were better than that.  So, we had a class system going on within our own race, and it was like an everyday thing.  It was not like, you know, here or there.  It was like an everyday thing, and you faced it.  And so being very dark, sometimes you probably wished that you were light.  Back then, they used to have a lot of commercials about bleaching cream.  You know, people would bleach their faces to make them lighter, and all that.  So in the '60s [1960s], we were really struggling for identity, who we were.  And were still trying to break out of the mentality of basically the field slave and the house slave.  Or house--you know, whatever--this kind of thing.  So, it was a whole lot of mentalities that we were trying to elevate ourselves to.  And we had a lot of people who were speaking.  Our role models were not really singers, even though we loved the Motown sound, you know, The Temptations, the Four Tops back then, [HistoryMaker] Smokey Robinson and The Miracles, and all of that.  You know, that was amazing.  Because as you know, back then when people would see a black doing a commercial for a toothpaste or something like that, we used to get on the phone, "Hey, So and So, a black man's on TV."  And just for a commercial, you know, it was--you know, we didn't take it for granted.  Folks would run around the TV to see it.  Or Ed Sullivan was going to have The Supremes on this Sunday [on 'The Ed Sullivan Show'].  You know, everybody was calling folks, "The Supremes are going to be on.  The Supremes are going to be on."  You know, you got all this cable stuff going on now and we see all this going on, but we don't realize it was not like that, you know.  (Laughter) So, there was more community.  We were excited to see certain things and the advancements, et cetera, that are taken for granted now.  And it was really some formulations and things going on.  Then the assassinations took us into some turbulent times.  I think we got a little lost as we went into the '70s [1970s] and '80s [1980s].  Our families started to, to suffer, and I don't think we've recovered yet.
Story_ID: 482783
Speaker 1: You talked about music, and you talked about dating.  As a teenager, were you involved in, were you musically inclined in any way?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I can't sing, never could.  And as a teenager, I did in high school [North Mecklenburg High School, Huntersville, North Carolina] I did play the drums, and I marched in the marching band.  So, that's my musical inclination, stuff like that.  I like good music and things like that, but that was about my role in that.
Speaker 1: In music?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And football, what position did you play?
Speaker 2: Well, I started out as a nose tackle in junior high [Robert Lacy Ranson Junior High School; Ranson Middle School, Charlotte, North Carolina], and then I moved to defensive end.  I ended up in high school as a middle linebacker, you know.
Speaker 1: And did you play basketball as well?
Speaker 2: No, I couldn't play basketball.  I could, I just learned.  And my friends would probably tell me, I'm still learning (laughter).  But I just really learned how to play.  As a matter of fact, a kid that I raised named Monte Campbell, took me and taught me how to play basketball, and I was like thirty something.  So, you know, I was the last kid picked when they had to do teams in school, and stuff like that.  It was kind of like, "Man, do we have to take him?"  You know, I could be under the basket wide open with nobody there and still miss, you know, that kind of thing.  So that, and baseball, you know, I was Charlie Brown with baseball.  I'm standing there holding the glove, and the ball would probably hit me in the head.  I just couldn't get the glove out there (laughter).
Speaker 1: And what about dating?  Who was your girlfriend in high school?  Did you have a girlfriend in high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had a girlfriend in high school.  As a matter of fact, I dated one girl from the eleventh grade all the way through college [North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina].  I thought we were going to get married.  We did not marry.  But so--yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you remember the prom?  Did you go to the prom (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I remember the prom.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember the prom, because I thought I wasn't going to get to go to the prom.  Because I had a total loss of my daddy's [Floyd Long, Jr.] pickup truck three weeks before the prom.  He cussed me out, and because he had a body shop, he could still fix it, so he fixed it.  I was going somewhere in his car and got hit there, and tore up his car a week before the prom.  So, I just knew.  You know, back then, in the day--I don't understand today.  Back then, in the day--you know, people today rent their kids limousines and all that.  Shoot, you weren't getting no limousine.  You better hope that your mama and them let you use their car that night to go to the prom.  (Laughter) And so, but he did let me use the car.  And so, I had on a white jacket and a pink shirt with a white bowtie (laughter), I remember that. Had a good time.
Story_ID: 482784
Speaker 1: Because your father [Floyd Long, Jr.] was a preacher and you said that he was strict, were you allowed to go out at night (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No (laughter).  We didn't get, we had the short end of the stick.  My dad owned a business.  And when we got to be about twelve or thirteen, he wouldn't buy us anything other than buy food, and to make sure you wasn't going to get put out on the street.  If you want clothes, you come work and buy your own.  I hated him then, we all did.  But now we appreciate him, because he actually taught us how to be independent, you know.  We know how to go after stuff, you know, and stuff like that.  So, I worked hard and all that.   But he wouldn't let us party, so we had to work Friday night.  If we weren't playing football, we had to come to work.  Saturdays we had to work, you know.
Speaker 1: Did you work for your father?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you had to work for the father.
Speaker 1: What did you do?
Speaker 2: We worked at the service station.  I learned how to not only pump gas and all that stuff--you know, back then there were no self-service stations.  So you'd pull up and we'd check your tires, check your oil, wash your windshield, tell you you needed a new air filter, you know. We--he taught us how to--when you got out that car--you're going to sell something.  You know, we'd check the wiper blades and all those kinds of things.  And, but I knew how to change oil, drop a transmission out and put a new transmission in, tune a car up, re-set the gaps and the points, you know, all of that stuff.  I could pretty well do a basic tune-up, change the tires and bust them down, and all of that stuff.  It was good.  My daddy taught us a lot that we could do.  And I could run--after a while I could run the place by myself when he wasn't there, and be over people and things like that.  So, we just were the kind of guys that on Monday we could hear the stories about what happened on the weekends at the people's parties, because we didn't ever get to go, you know.  Sometimes I'd sneak out the house.  I remember one time I snuck out the house and put pillows in my bed, because my mom [Hattie Alston Long] would come by and check.  And the next morning, I had come and was sitting at breakfast.  Because she cooked breakfast, and we always sat and ate before--and she was like, "Well, Eddie [HistoryMaker Bishop Eddie L. Long], how'd you sleep?"  And I'm like, "I slept good."  And she just bust out laughing.  She said, "I guess you did, wherever you were," (laughter).  You know, and she, I just knew she was going to punch me out.  And it was just so funny, I'll never forget.  I just knew never to do that again.  But she was like, "You don't, don't think you that slick," you know, and stuff like that.  But I just knew I was going to die, you know.  And so when she started laughing, I looked at my brother and I said, "Well, let me laugh, too.  Maybe we can laugh our way through this thing," (laughter).
Story_ID: 482785
Speaker 1: Tell me about your friends in the neighborhood.  Now, you lived in an apartment in New Jersey, and your father [Floyd Long, Jr.] bought a home when you moved back to Charlotte [North Carolina].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We rented a house when we first came to Charlotte.  Then I remember we moved to a place called Trinity Park [Charlotte, North Carolina], and that's, my daddy bought a house.  As a matter of fact, back then, the house, we still own the house.  The house was only thirteen thousand dollars.  And this is a one, two, three bedrooms, two baths, a living room, big kitchen, den, a screened-in porch area, and sitting on about a half an acre.  And boy, if I had knew--if they were like that today, I'd buy an old house, and-- (laughter).  And it was totally brick, you know, and stuff like that.  But, you know, it was relative to the times.  And so, we stayed in that house until my daddy died.
Speaker 1: Tell me about your friends in the neighborhood.
Speaker 2: I had some good friends in the neighborhood, you know.  A guy named Johnny [ph.] who lived around the corner, he was, his mother had died and he actually was living with his sister and her husband.  He was like a real good friend of mine.  And then a guy named Earl [ph.] who used to date a girl who lived behind me, and I dated the young lady in college [North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina].  So we were just like dating buddies, you know, and did a lot of things together.  Then a block up the street, there were some guys that we had a rivalry with.  They really didn't like us, and we really didn't like them.  And so, I didn't go on that street much (laughter) unless I was walking with somebody.  And we used to have this little thing where we (makes noise), and I could do this real loud.  And I'd just go outside and do this little bird call to see if any of them were outside, and they would respond back to me.  And so, we just kind of would have spontaneous hangouts--throw rocks at mailboxes and get in trouble with that.  And I played basketball, at least I tried, but you know, it's good exercise.  But we used to play a lot.  When it snowed, we used to have the snow bowl.  And that was, as soon as it got high enough, everybody would put on some warm clothes and we would go to this field behind my house.  And all the people in the neighborhood, we'd play a football game, and then we'd play tackle in the snow.  So, it would be pretty rough out there, but fun.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The other people that lived in the community, do you have any idea what their occupations were?  And were they two-parent households?
Speaker 2: Just about all of them were two-parent households.  Across the street, this guy had two daughters, the Williams [ph.].  And one I kind of liked, but he was an ex-Green Beret [U.S. Army Special Forces Command].  So for a while he wasn't home, and then he retired and we never went over there after that.  He was, he looked like he would major pain you in a minute (laughter).  But everybody was--basically, you know, the way things are now, it's totally different, you know, just--I would say 95 percent, and this is a whole community.  You know, I used to drive the school bus back in Charlotte.  When you were a junior and a senior [at North Mecklenburg High School, Huntersville, North Carolina], if you had a driver's license, you could go train and you could drive the school bus.  They put governors on the bus, where the bus wouldn't go over thirty-five miles an hour.  And so I drove the school bus for our community, so I knew everybody, you know, and stuff like that.  And just about everybody had two parents in the house.  Now, I ain't saying they were all happy, (laughter) but it was two-parent homes.  And I can't think of any of my friends that just had one parent in the house.  I don't, I didn't--
Speaker 1: Do you know what their occupations might have been?
Speaker 2: Well, the [U.S.] military, teachers.  They were, they were kind of middle class.  Plumbers, truck drivers, kind of like that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 482786
Speaker 1: Back to driving the school bus.  How did you work that?  You were going to school as well.
Speaker 2: I was going to school as well.
Speaker 1: So did you drive the kids that went to your school [North Mecklenburg High School, Huntersville, North Carolina], or another school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  What I'd do was get up real early and pick up the elementary kids.  I had two routes.  To pick up the elementary kids, I had to get up early.  I picked them up and took them to Long Creek Elementary [Long Creek Elementary School, Huntersville, North Carolina], dropped them off, and would come back and pick up the high school kids that went to high school with me and would take them to school with me, you know.  And so I'm there by 8:30 when school started, with the kids.  And then I would--your last period would be a study hall.  And I'd go pick up the elementary kids, take them home, and then come back to the school, high school, and pick up the high school kids and drop them off in the community, and park my bus in a field behind the house.
Speaker 1: So, you always had a ride to school?
Speaker 2: I always had a ride to school.  You'd be, and I was kind of crooked, too, sometimes.  Because sometimes if it was a major exam day, you know, the kids would vote on whether we should be late (laughter).  And this was when we didn't have cell phones, so I would fake a breakdown and sit on the side of the road for a while.  By the time they figured, "Well the bus must have broke down, it's not here yet," then it would crank up and we'd--don't put that on tape (laughter).
Story_ID: 482787
Speaker 1: Your father [Floyd Long, Jr.] was a preacher.  What church did he pastor, or did he preach at (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What church he didn't pastor.  This is the history of my dad.  My dad is a pastor.  My dad would go start a church, a lot of times from scratch, build a new building.  He'd grow the membership, get in the new building, and within six months, on just a normal Sunday, he'd get up, cuss the deacons out, and telling my mom [Hattie Alston Long], "Let's go."  And he'd walk down the aisle and leave, and we followed behind him, and would never come back.  He'd go start another church.  So, he was a church builder.  He could grow a church with members, and then he would always build a nice building.  And it never failed; within six months he's going to get up, cuss the deacons out, and leave.
Speaker 1: Did you ever find out what the problem, what problem he was having with the deacons (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, as a--as a pastor myself, (laughter) it is very challenging at times to work.  And he was always in a rural church.  So in a rural church, the deacons generally always felt that they were supposed to run the church, and all the pastor was to do was to come and preach and do ceremonial things.  But they controlled the pastor and everything else, and my dad just wasn't going for that.  He would deal with it, and argue with them for a while, and after a while he'd get sick of them.  I guess he was looking for a place where he would be the visionary, et cetera.  But my dad was a tough man, too.  He was a tough guy, I gotta, you know.  So--
Speaker 1: So you spent your Sundays in church?
Speaker 2: Yeah, from the rising of the sun to the going down of the sun, all day.
Speaker 1: And what were your thoughts about church?  Did you have any idea that you would become a preacher at that time?
Speaker 2: At one time, I really wanted to be a preacher.  I used to be the little cute boy, and Mama would say, "He's going to be a preacher."  And I'd be playing preacher.  "Oh, look at him," you know.  And then after a while, it's like I don't want nothing to do with this.  I, I just didn't want it.  I had seen what my daddy was going through and all that, and I wanted to be a businessman.  That's the side of my daddy I caught.  That's why I went to North Carolina Central University [Durham, North Carolina] and majored in business and marketing.
Story_ID: 482788
Speaker 1: So, you were saying that you thought you might want to be a preacher, but then you saw what your father [Floyd Long, Jr.] had to go through.  Tell me, expound more what you mean by what he had to go through.
Speaker 2: Well, it just, it just seemed--well, number one, to be very candid with you--it wasn't something that he could make a living off of.  So we were, we struggled sometimes financially.  And he was always making sacrifices for the church, and it didn't seem like--there was always some friction between him and the board.  And it just seemed like the church really never appreciated who he was.  And I just, like--that's just--it doesn't seem worth it to fight and do all that that he does, and seems like he's always coming out on the short end of the stick.  And I wanted to be able to provide and make a living, and stuff like that, and I did like the business side of things.  You know, because we used to have to count Daddy's money and make the books balance, and all of that stuff.  So that was exciting, things like that.  So, I wanted to--that looked like it rewarded you more for what you did.  You worked hard, and you got the benefit of working hard.  If you were lazy, you know, it was a direct reflection.  And it gave me an opportunity to be very, very creative, and I'm kind of a creative kind of guy.
Story_ID: 482789
Speaker 1: During this time, your high school [North Mecklenburg High School, Huntersville, North Carolina], your senior year in high school, and even a little before that, the Vietnam War is going on.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What, what do you remember about that?  Because you were going to turn eighteen, and were you worried about the draft?
Speaker 2: Well, everybody was kind of worried about the draft at that time, as you got ready for graduation.  But one of the things that was stated that kind of brought some solace and comfort, was that if you were in school--college, et cetera, that--I remember having to go down to the selective service thing [Selective Service System] and register for the draft and all of that, and they'd give you various classifications.  And so, they had not touched anybody who was classed in school, et cetera.  And so at that time they were drafting, and there were people who were volunteering.  But also, the war was now starting to get under great criticism, and because of that, there was not--no escalating of troops and trying to bring more people into the [U.S.] military.  And so, as long as you stayed in school, that pretty well provided you a shelter or a way of escape.  Thank God, none of us, none of my, me or my older brothers or my younger one [Larry Long], had to go into the military.  And it's not like we don't love this country, but that was a very challenging time.
Speaker 1: Were your brothers in college, your older brother at the time?
Speaker 2: All of my, my oldest brother [Floyd Long III] went to North Carolina State University [Raleigh, North Carolina].  My oldest brother was just extremely smart.  Now he went, but he didn't finish.  I was the first one to finish, because he dropped out after a couple of years and got married and went to work.  Then my next oldest brother, James [James Long], went to Winston-Salem State [Winston-Salem State College; Winston-Salem State University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina].  He played football, et cetera, got married and dropped out, you know.  So I went to North Carolina Central University [Durham, North Carolina], graduated, didn't get married (laughter).
Story_ID: 482790
Speaker 1: Tell me about your experience in college [North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina].  What was that like for you?
Speaker 2: Well, it's interesting.  Number one, from your earlier question in talking to me about how my daddy [Floyd Long, Jr.] was strict and didn't let us go to parties and stuff like that--the first night at college, everybody was talking about the parties.  "Let's go here, and let's go here."  I said, "Please don't say that.  I came up very strict."  I think one of the reasons why I enjoy a reasonably good amount of health--and a lot of people--I'll be fifty-five, and some people say, "You don't look that age."  Because my mama [Hattie Alston Long] and them used to make us go to bed, you know.  We, we, we're in bed by ten.  I'm talking about I'm in high school [North Mecklenburg High School, Huntersville, North Carolina], you know, I'm--you know (laughter).  And we didn't have the temptations like cable and all that.  You know, you had three channels, and at eleven o'clock it's signed out, and it's that (makes noise) kind of thing, and stuff like that.  But I, the biggest thing I wanted to do the first day of college was to sit outside and see what midnight looked like.  That was just, it was something about--because I could not stay up until midnight.  Maybe twice a year, maybe Christmas or something, I got to stay up late.  I'm talking about I'm a senior in high school, and it was, you know, I, my body was trained to be sleep by then.  So, I sat up and watched midnight, and it was just of the most peaceful experiences that I ever had in my life, you know.  And I just, I'll never forget the first night of college.  Everybody was running around trying to get into everything else, and I just wanted to sit there and look at midnight (laughter).  But the other thing that just--I just--my freshman year was really great, because it was the first time I had, I was liberated from my dad's rule.  I had, I was independent.  I could go and come the way I wanted, and it was just really fresh.  And then my upbringing helped me, because I did go to parties, but I just didn't do it like everybody else.  There was a certain time my body would say, or something inside, "It's time for you to go home."  By the time I go back to my room, somebody would come tell me an hour later somebody got shot at where I was, or some big fight broke out, or whatever.  So, I would thank my mom and them for just putting that little--I could tell when the environment was shifting, and "You just need to get out of here," that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Now this is 1972 that you go to college?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The year that you, you graduated from high school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Story_ID: 482791
Speaker 1: What about the classes?  What courses were you taking?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, you generally take your regular core classes, you know and, but, in that your maths, your historys, public speaking, things like that.  The thing with North Carolina Central [North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina]--again, I said I was a marginal student, and normally I wouldn't have gotten in.  So what they did, it's called their academic skill section, which they took some select students.  So the classes were small, and you got some individual attention.  So my freshman year, I was taking the same classes everybody else was taking, but getting more personalized attention, and in a small class, maybe ten or fifteen people in these classes.  And I took a couple--my math I know was with everybody else.  I remember taking it under Dr. Brown [ph.], and I didn't like her and she didn't like me.  You know, that was the only F I made in college.  So, that was (laughter) my freshman year.  But for the most part, then you got integrated into your sophomore year, the full college experience, et cetera.  But I made--the teachers were like family, you know.  They just really--again, that thing where they got into your life, tell you who you are, and expect a lot.  And when people tell you, you know, "I expect great things out of you," it's like, well, you must see some things, and so I'm going to show you I've got it there.
Speaker 1: Who were your influences then?
Speaker 2: I had a professor who was actually over the, he became over the marketing department, Dr. Sundar Fleming.  And I used to go over to his house, he and his wife, and have dinner.  I'm still in touch with him now.  He was just an amazing guy.  And then my black history teacher, I can't think of his name right now.  But he was just kind of, just very profound, you know.  He'd have a little pipe, and he would sit and tell stories.  And the way he would teach, he would put you in certain situations and then give us projects that we had to do.  And I just got excited about learning about things.  And he was just a very distinguished guy.  And he would never let you get real close to him, you know.  He just was a person you would sit back in awe, you know.  And I just remember him when he would always come in class five minutes late, and everybody would straighten up when he walks in.  And he'd start out--and it's something like, 'The Great Debaters,' like with Denzel [Denzel Washington], the way he would do.  That's the kind of way he would teach his class, and just constantly challenging you.  And I miss that.  I had fun in his classes.

Speaker 1: What else was going on, on the campus at that time?
Speaker 2: Campus life was great, because a lot of things was centered around, within the school [North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina].  During that time, I pledged Kappa [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity].  And back then--I wouldn't pledge a fraternity now.  And the reason I wouldn't pledge a fraternity now is it's really--you can survive in college without, you know, being (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In a fraternity?
Speaker 2: In a fraternity.  Back then when I was coming up, if you didn't play sports or were in a fraternity, you were zero.  That's was all there is.  No girl looked at you (laughter), nobody paid you any attention, and I don't care how handsome you are, or whatever; you had to be an athlete or in a Greek organization.  And all of my friends--I came to college with several of my high school buddies.  My girlfriend came.  We all went to the same college, you know, kids--a couple of kids I played in the band with, and one guy I was raised with from the seventh grade on once I moved back, you know, and all of that.  And all the guys decided to pledge Kappa, and they just came to me, "We're pledging Kappa," and I didn't even know what Kappa was.  And by the time they explained to me, it was like if you don't pledge, you're going to be left out.  So I, and I thought the little rough stuff was a myth until one night I experienced it (laughter).  I remember I turned to my roommate, who said, "Do you know what they're doing?"  He said, he called me a fool.  He said like, "You didn't think none of this was going to happen?"  (Laughter) I was like, "No, I was kind of like, I just thought that was all rumor."  But I made it through, glad about it.
Speaker 1: What other organizations were on the campus there?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the things that I initiated--we, you know, we're in Durham [North Carolina].  You got Duke University [Durham, North Carolina] you got up in Chapel Hill [North Carolina], not too far away.  You got UNC in Chapel Hill [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina].  You got North Carolina State [North Carolina State University, Raleigh, North Carolina].  You got all these big schools, and they got radio stations and all that.  And we didn't even have, we didn't have a radio program.  I went to a local radio station and said, "Look, we don't have a radio show.  We don't even have a radio station."  And I just kind of--whatever; I never did anything on the radio.  And I was shocked.  The owner of the radio station said, "Well, we're going to give you free air time.  You can develop your own radio show," and all that.  So I developed a radio show called, 'What's Happening at NCC' [ph.], and played music and did sports for the school and interviews with professors, and all of that.  And so for my junior and senior year in college, I was president of the frat.  I became the big man on campus and initiated that, and got awards from the school for it, and things like that.  So, and because I'm very creative, we used to throw the best parties, our frat did, because we put on major productions, like when we coronated our queen.  I like choreography and all of that.  I do a lot of that, especially when I was in college.  And we would have turn-away crowds, because I remember I knew how Earth, Wind, and Fire made all their explosions.  I would go order pounds of hot ice and drop it in water.  And, you know, they didn't have fog machines then; you had to make it.  And then your stage has got the little fog on it.  And I built lights, and the lights were shining.  We used to have a ball.  You know, if Eddie Long [HistoryMaker Bishop Eddie L. Long] had his name on something, people knew it was going to be good.  And I was shy.
Story_ID: 482793
Speaker 1: And why do you say you were shy?
Speaker 2: I was very shy. I was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Really?
Speaker 2: Because I never, it took me a long time to grow out of secondhand clothes, and people always looking at me as a secondhand guy.  I was a senior in high school [North Mecklenburg High School, Huntersville, North Carolina] before I got a pair of Converse.  You either had Converse, or you had nothing.  Converse was only ten dollars, and I, I couldn't afford them.  And so if you had something from Kmart [Kmart Corporation] on, kids would make fun of you, you know.  And so, you had to have some Chuck Taylor Converse.  So, I always made myself second.  I just--it was hard, and I never--because I didn't dress right, and I never thought a girl would want to talk to me.  I was surprised when I went up to them.  I just, I got my nerve up when I talked to my girlfriend in tenth or eleventh grade, and we got together.  I didn't think she was going to pay me any attention.  I just said, "I'm desperate now for a girlfriend (laughter)."  But I just never--I had this thing in my head.  Even now, my wife [Vanessa Griffin Long] pushes me, you know.  I can deal with it.  I was raised with three boys, wasn't no sisters.  And the challenge me and my wife has, she was raised with--she's seven of seven girls, no boys.  And I'm four boys, you know, and all of that.  And so I said, "You don't know nothing about men."  And she said, "You don't know nothing about women."  I say but I'm very comfortable in ministering the men and addressing men.  When it gets around to talking to women, I get nervous, you know.  So, she pushed me to do the women thing--elect ladies.  And it just, and I'm surprised that I have something to say.  But it's more so a mental thing, that I'm still thinking I'm still in the secondhand clothes.  I'm thinking I'm Cinderella after the carriage turned back to the pumpkin, you know.  And so--pray I overcome.

Speaker 1: How did you pay for college [North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Well, my daddy [Floyd Long, Jr.] will tell you he paid, and that's not right (laughter).  I learned the skill of relationship.  I had a student loan and applied for some grants.  Back then it was a little bit easier, especially for African Americans, to get a little bit more money, a little money for school.  I think it's much tighter now.  But also, I just would go to the financial aid office every day, to the point that everybody knew me, you know.  I'd come in there, "Miss Jones [ph.], Miss So and So, any money around here?  Any grants?  Can I do y'all any errands?" or whatever.  So, various days I would come in, and a grant hit.  "Eddie [HistoryMaker Bishop Eddie L. Long], a grant came in, and I just gave it to you," you know, and stuff like that.  And my mama [Hattie Alston Long], she's an old school mama.  She'd just write me a letter.  I'd get a letter from my mom, you know, every two weeks.  She'd put ten dollars in it or something like that; that was a blessing.  But I basically worked.  I drove a school bus while I was in college, and that helped me with the expenses.  But I worked it out myself.  Well, God worked it out for me.
Story_ID: 482795
Speaker 1: Did your academics become any better while you were there?
Speaker 2: Very much so.  I performed much better in a predominantly black situation for some reason, and they did become better.  The only suffering I did was when I pledged [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity], and my grades dropped.  I think I graduated with about a 2.9 [grade point average].  It would have been a 3-something, but it was just so hard to keep up.  That semester I pledged, everything just went crazy.
Speaker 1: Now, business was your major, right?
Speaker 2: Right, and marketing was my concentration.
Speaker 1: And what did you think you would do with your degree once you graduated?
Speaker 2: I just wanted to be a businessman.  But the other thing is my dream awakened again, the possibility of becoming a lawyer.
Speaker 1: When was the first time you thought about being a lawyer?
Speaker 2: Well, as I said, I told the guidance counselor in eighth grade I wanted to be a lawyer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he told me I couldn't (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Couldn't, okay.
Speaker 2: You know, and so that killed that.  And so, right when I was getting ready to graduate, I applied to law school, et cetera. and did this little cramming.  And, because North Carolina Central [North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina] has a law school.  And I was turned down because I was--they had different point systems.  You get this for this, this for this, and this for that.  And I was three points from being accepted, and I remember sitting on the law school steps crying.  And I was lost then.  I graduated, and the girl I was dating graduated magna cum laude.  I graduated, "Oh, Lordy, thank you Lordy." (Laughter) And she had job offers everywhere.  I had done a lot of interviewing, but I did not secure the job that I wanted, so I stayed in Durham [North Carolina].  I was broken-hearted and didn't know what to do, and I took a job with The Durham Morning Herald Sun [The Durham Morning Herald; The Herald-Sun], and I became a paperboy.  But it was the night route.  I made good money.  You start the route at midnight and you finish up about six in the morning, a motor route.  I used to deliver Dean Smith, the world famous coach for the University of North Carolina [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina] basketball team, I used to deliver his paper, and things like that.  And I did that for a year, just trying to figure out where I was going.  I wasn't going back to Charlotte [North Carolina].  And finally, I had interviewed with Ford [Ford Motor Company] when I graduated.  They came back, I interviewed with them again, and then they said, "Well, we hired you."  And I said, "No, you didn't hire me.  You sent me to Jacksonville [North Carolina] for an interview, and I got a rejection letter."  They said, "No, according to our records, we had told them to hire you."  And so, they thought I was hired.  So, anyway, they hired me on the spot and sent me to Denver [Colorado].  And I just started with Ford as a zone manager for the parts and service division, which supervises the back end of dealerships and everything that happens on the back side.
Speaker 1: One question.  Who was the president of the university while you were there?
Speaker 2: Albert Whiting [Albert N. Whiting].
Speaker 1: Oh, Albert Whiting?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
