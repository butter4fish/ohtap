Speaker 1: Okay, today we have a playwright as our guest and we'll be doing an oral archival interview with Ms. Suzan-Lori, let me get it straight.  Suzan--? (Pronouncing it Suzanne).
Speaker 2: It's just Suzan-Lori.  (Pronounced the same as Susan).  The Z throws people off.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: It's just Suzan-Lori.
Speaker 1: Suzan-Lori.
Speaker 2: It's just Suzan-Lori.
Speaker 1: Suzan-Lori Parks.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there you go.
Speaker 1: And I'm going to ask-- (BRIEF INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: I'm going begin by asking you to give us your full name.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And to spell it for us.
Speaker 1: Okay, it's Suzan-Lori Parks and that's S-U-Z-A-N - (hyphen) L-O-R-I, last name P-A-R-K-S.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And I'm going to ask you another question.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that is, at birth was that your first name?
Speaker 1: No my first--no, it's a complicated little story because my mom's from Texas where so many people in her family have two names.  So it's like my aunt Marilyn, Billy Jo, you know everybody's got two names, I was called Suzan-Lori.  But my name at birth was Suzan Lori.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And you decided to hyphenate it?
Speaker 1: Well no actually it was a misprint.  My very first play in New York was done at a place called The Gas Station which was on Avenue B and Second Street in Manhattan in the East Village.  And when they printed the--darn I wish I had a little--well I can't find it now.  But when they printed the little card, you know the posters for the show, they misspelled my name.  And it was such like I was like, oh, they misspelled my name!  And my director, a woman named Lori Carlos, who's a wonderful actor and director was in the original For Colored Girls [For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf, 1975] Lori Carlos, played Lady in Blue actually, but a great director and great writer too.  She was directing my play and she said, oh keep it honey, keep it.  So I just kept it.
Speaker 2: Good.  Good, I think it looks good.
Speaker 1: So yeah, making lemonade out of lemons.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  That's my phrase. (BRIEF INTERRUPTION).
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm going to ask you two questions.  One is today's date.  That's a very difficult one.
Speaker 2: It's the 21st of November, 2006.
Speaker 1: All right.  And where are we?
Speaker 2: We are in Venice Beach, California.  I live in Venice Beach, California.  This is my living room.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: I wish I had all the camera equipment all the time, but--
Speaker 1: And I'm going to ask you now five "Parade Magazine" questions.
Speaker 2: Yes, okay.
Speaker 1: Very easy, very difficult.  Your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Purple, that was easy.
Speaker 1: All right!  Your favorite season, time of year?
Speaker 2: That's hard.  It's tricky.  Maybe, it depends where I am.  Fall.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Fall in New England or--but it's also, fall is like back to school, makes me think of going back to school so--
Speaker 1: But you mean here in Los Angeles, fall may not be your favorite season?
Speaker 2: Well we don't have the dramatic leaves.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know not all that, the beautiful leaves changing and what not.  But so, but maybe it's fall, it feels fall, you know I don't know.
Speaker 1: Right.  That sounds good to me.
Speaker 2: I know it's just a silly question but yeah.
Speaker 1: Your favorite vacation spot?
Speaker 2: That's tricky cause I really--we don't vacation much so I--sorry.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: But my husband next week, Paul [Paul Oscher], my Paul is taking me to Maui.  So that's my favorite--I've never been.  We've never been so that will be my favorite vacation spot I guess.
Speaker 1: Okay, that--so Maui  [Hawaii] becomes your favorite.
Speaker 2: Maui, that's right.  That's the only--I haven't had a vacation in you know, forever so--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well you've earned one.
Speaker 2: Yeah, thank you.
Speaker 1: And finally--oh no, not finally but your favorite food?
Speaker 2: I don't, I'm not sure.  Probably, I don't know. I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Sounds good.
Speaker 2: I don't like--I like all, I eat you know.
Speaker 1: You saute it?
Speaker 2: I eat--chocolate how about.
Speaker 1: Chocolate?  Why?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Someone just gave me some expensive chocolate as a present and I saved some.
Speaker 1: Good.  Chocolate is your favorite food.
Speaker 2: Is that a food?
Speaker 1: Yes, oh certainly.
Speaker 2: Is that a snack, they call it.  It's not one of the food groups.  It's the sugar food group.  Well okay.
Speaker 1: Right.  And you can have it as your favorite food if you want.
Speaker 2: Okay, thank you.
Speaker 1: The--and finally, your favorite saying.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I have a couple.  Let's see.  I think it's Mary McCloud Bethune, she said, "Lift as you climb."  I think that's one of my favorites.  "Each one teach one", that's one of my favorites.  "Be the change that you desire to see in the world", Mahatma Gandhi said that one.  Those are the three.
Speaker 1: That tells a lot about you.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: That means that each of those favorite sayings--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --involves reaching back, helping.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Not just going your journey alone.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: But bringing others along with you.
Speaker 2: Well that's the whole thing, right.
Speaker 1: And that's what you really enjoy.
Speaker 2: Oh sure.  Well I love going forward.  There was a gentlemen in New York whose name is Jojo Gonzalez who is from the Philippines originally.  And he--we were doing, we were working on the plays he performed in week one in New York City at the public theater and we were working on the plays.  And he said you know what, Suzan-Lori, you remind me of my grandma in Manila.  And he said cause back in the day movies were very popular but they were always very crowded in the Philippines.  You know everyone loved the movies so everyone would stand shoulder to shoulder and you know if you were small back when he was a little kid, he said we couldn't see.  So grandma would say children get behind me and she'd crowd us all behind her and she'd get a safety pin and she'd march through the theater poking people.  This is grandma now, poking people with a safety pin.  They'd scatter out of the way and would allow the children to get in the front where they'd have a wonderful view of the screen.  And he said that's what you're doing.  You're my grandma--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: -- poking people with a pin so all the children could come along behind you.
Speaker 1: You're the poker.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I am the--I'm the grand, I'm the grandma poker.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So yeah, but that's the, you know each one teach one, lift as you climb.  That's that kind of, yeah.
Speaker 1: And that's a very good philosophy and it's reflected--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in your work so far in what you're doing.
Speaker 2: Oh well thank you.
Speaker 1: Which we will get into a little bit later.
Speaker 2: Thank you.

See they always called her Francis Ammon so it's A-M-M-O-N, I, I'm not sure.  But it might be A-M-O-N, but I think A-M-M-O-N, but it's Ammon.
Speaker 1: Okay. I've spelled it A, double m.

Speaker 2: Right, so Kathleen Durham Butler I--that was her last--
Speaker 1: Kathleen Durham--
Speaker 2: Butler.
Speaker 1: --McMillan Butler?
Speaker 2: No, no.  No, cause McMillan was her first married name so I, I'm not sure.  But--I've never been divorced but when you get divorced don't you leave your name behind?
Speaker 1: Some of them hyphenate them and keep them all.
Speaker 2: Oh some of them hyphenate and keep them.  I think she let the name go.  So I think it was--but her maiden name was Durham cause her father and mother were Durham.  So she was, yeah.  So Kathleen Margaret I think was her middle name.  Kathleen Margaret Durham.  And then her last husband was I think Joe Butler.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she was a Texan, right.
Speaker 1: Born in--and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I think she was born in Tex--see, I don't want to, you know there was something about Louisiana in there but no I'm pretty sure she was born in Texas.  But I might be wrong.
Speaker 1: You find out different--
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: I'm just putting a little small question mark after it.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah I'm not--
Speaker 1: Do you have a date of birth?
Speaker 2: Gee, I'm spacing on it.  I know it was August, something like August 9th or August 7th, I'm not sure.  And I'm completely ignorant of the year.  1900 and something, but I don't know.

Story_ID: 457
Speaker 1: Now still on the maternal side, Kathleen Margaret Durham Butler, her mother's name?  Can you go back that far?
Speaker 2: Ellen, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Ellen and--
Speaker 1: E-L-L-E-N.
Speaker 2: --L-E-N.  I don't know her maiden name and I want to say Durham you know was her married name cause I know her husband was Brewster, see Granddaddy Bruce.  I mean there's so many stories about Granddaddy Bruce who was Ellen's, who was my grand, my mother's mother's (unclear) my mother's grandfather, right.

Speaker 2: My mother's father was Walter McMillan and that, M-C--I'm not sure how to spell McMillan.  And he passed away before my grandmother but I'm not sure when.  And I'm not sure of his birthday.
Speaker 1: Or place of birth?
Speaker 2: No, I'd say--
Speaker 1: That's fine.
Speaker 2: I'm guessing it was like Dallas cause Dallas you know they all moved west.  See they were eastern Texas people and they all moved west.  Granddaddy Bruce like, was a businessman.  He like built sidewalks in Odessa.  I mean they moved way out west you know in Odessa and you know so it was a frontier town.  But I, I'm not sure--
Speaker 1: His name was Walter McMillan--
Speaker 2: Walter McMillan.
Speaker 1: --but they called him Granddad--?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  Oh I'm sorry.  Walter McMillan was Kathleen Butler's first husband.

Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes, right. Right, Ellen Durham and Bruce Durham.
Speaker 1: It's confusing after a while.
Speaker 2: No, I know.  I know, it's totally confusing to me.  But Ellen Durham and Bruce Durham and that's who we called Granddaddy Bruce.  That's Granddaddy Bruce.
Speaker 1: Oh, Granddaddy Bruce, okay.
Speaker 2: But he wasn't, he was my great grandfather.  I mean my mother called him Granddaddy Bruce and so you know, yeah.  But I don't know his dates.
Speaker 1: Either one, Ellen or Granddaddy Bruce?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  No.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's fine.
Speaker 2: I mean my mom might know.
Speaker 1: You're doing fine.  You're doing fine.  And can we go back any further or is that the extent of it?
Speaker 2: Well my--well let's try.  I don't know their names exactly but--
Speaker 1: This would be great-great.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Ellen, there is a--Ellen's mother, my mom calls Granny.  That's not really a name.  She was like a Seminole Indian woman, Granny.  Brewster's mother--and I don't know the, Ellen's father.  You know I don't know that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I just remember Granny cause there are pictures of Granny.  And then Brewster's parents are, this is funny the names they called--Zachary who was a white guy and--
Speaker 1: Z-A-C-H-A-R-Y.
Speaker 2: --C-H-A-R-Y.  Think he was like Irish or Scottish.  Maybe Scottish I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And mom, you know Mamma they called her--
Speaker 1: And we're talking about Zachary Durham?
Speaker 2: Zachary Durham, right.  Of course, right.  It would have to be Durham, right.  Zachary Durham.  And then like, Mamma, you know the lady--you know, I--that's what they called her.  She is Zachary Durham's wife, a woman of African descent named Mamma were Bruce Durham's parents.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I--they--I'm sure somebody remembers her name, her real name.  I'm no sure.  But there are pictures of the two of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have any of those pictures?
Speaker 2: I have like bad photocopies of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But for the Walter McMillan side of the family, we, I have an Aunt Eva who lives in Dallas [Texas] who's the family historian and has lots of cool pictures, Walter McMillan who is my mother's father, yeah.  So there are pictures cause that whole side of the family you know was well known.
Speaker 1: And the historian was an aunt?
Speaker 2: My aunt, well yeah, my Aunt Eva.
Speaker 1: Eva.
Speaker 2: Who's a twin of Aunt Neva.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Eva and Neva, you see where it comes from.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: Aunt Eva and Aunt Neva.  And Aunt Eva is the family historian and she's, I'm not sure how old she is but she knows everything about the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that really goes, takes back your maternal parents?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's pretty much, that's as far as I know anything about them.
Story_ID: 458
Speaker 1: Okay.  You want to try going back on your--?
Speaker 2: My dad [Donald Roderick Parks]?  That's even harder.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I'll try.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: For my dad and then--
Speaker 1: Dad's parents?
Speaker 2: Yeah, was let's see, Lucy is my dad's mother's name.  Lucy and her--her married name was Smith because she remarried.  My dad's father died when he was like very, very, very young.  So he--she remarried soon after that.  So Lucy Smith is her name.  She was born in Georgia and moved to Chicago [Illinois] as a, you know--I'm not sure how old she was, but she moved to Chicago you know as so many people did.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And her birthday, I know her birthday.  It's--
Speaker 1: Oh wonderful.
Speaker 2: Well yeah, cause it's easy to remember.  The 3rd of May, 1900, that's an easy one to remember.  I always remembered that cause it's a week before mine and it's 1900.  So it's the 3rd of May, 1900.  And her, see we never knew her--I mean I never knew my father's father.  But, and, but her husband, the guy we called granddaddy was a man named James Smith who was a Pullman Porter who she married soon after.  Not soon after but you know however long after my dad's father died.  So it was James Smith and I don't know his (unclear).
Speaker 1: And Pullman porters were the upper echelon.
Speaker 2: Yeah. He was a great guy, great guy.  Loved jazz music and would tour the country and he was a really cool guy.
Speaker 1: Now because this would be your grandfather, James Smith--
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: --did you know him at all? Did he live--
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah.  He died in, I want to say somewhere around 1975 or '76 [1976].  I don't know his birthday.  Yeah, I don't know his dates, but he died somewhere around '75 [1975] or '76 [1976].  Yeah, and she--grandma died--
Speaker 1: So you were a little girl but you can remember him?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh sure.  Oh sure.  He was really a neat guy.  And Grandma Lucy died--we called them grand mom in Chicago because she lived in Chicago and grand mom in Texas so that's we distinguished the two grandmothers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Geography was the great distinguisher--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --in our family.  But she passed away in 1988, yeah.  So that was before my grand mom, my mother's mother.  And before my mother--no.  Yeah, and before my mother's father?  I'm not sure.  It gets kind of, I get confused.
Speaker 1: But you can remember even though you were a little girl?
Speaker 2: Oh sure.  Yeah, grandma in Texas, oh yeah.  All of them except Walter McMillan, my mom's father I didn't know so well.  And then Granddaddy Bruce died like a year before I was born and they were, had passed away already.
Story_ID: 459
Speaker 1: Okay.  The grandmother in Texas, did you visit them as a little girl?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Yeah, when my dad [Donald Roderick Parks] was in Vietnam in the, when was that '68 [1968], '69 [1969], '70 [1970], yeah he did two tours in Vietnam.  My mom--because he was a career army officer, you know.  And my mom, he and my mom [Francis McMillan] thought that the best, the safest thing to do cause it was 1968.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It was not safe to have--
Speaker 1: It was not.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So you know dad was going to be all the way in Vietnam.  What were mom and those kids cause I have a brother and a sister, one sister older, brother younger-- what we're going to do, like you know--
Speaker 1: I may be getting a little ahead.
Speaker 2: Oh it's okay.
Speaker 1: Where were you living in that period as--?
Speaker 2: Right.  We decided to move to Texas.  Dad went to Vietnam and we moved to Texas, to West Texas, Odessa because grand mom in Texas, mom's mother and her whole family, all her sisters, her brother are you know--
Speaker 1: Were right there.
Speaker 2: Right.  Everyone was in the city in the town of Odessa so that was considered a safe, a smart thing to do while dad was away at Vietnam.  And so we lived there for two or three years and visited you know all the time.  You know it was either, we were either visiting West Texas or Chicago [Illinois], you know to visit one grand mom or the other.  So yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we--
Speaker 1: Let me bring myself back up to date.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Your date of birth is--?
Speaker 2: May the 10th, 1963.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your place of birth?
Speaker 2: Fort Knox, Kentucky of course.
Speaker 1: I remember reading that.

Speaker 1: No, no, Greensboro, you were right.
Speaker 2: Greensboro, yeah.
Story_ID: 460
Speaker 1: Okay, good.  Good.  All right, let's get back to your parents.  Did your mother [Francis McMillan] ever tell you how she and your dad [Donald Roderick Parks] first met?
Speaker 2: Oh gee.
Speaker 1: Well first, let me ask you this, did she ever discuss what it was like growing up as a child for her?
Speaker 2: Oh sure.  Well some things you know and it's--what's interesting is that over the years I think it's become easier maybe for people to talk about, they expect--I mean because I mean she'd tell, sure she'd tell us things like in Green, Greenville--not Greensville.  That's where Ray Charles was born.  I'm writing a Ray Charles musical so I get the two confused.  But in Greenville where she was born, Greenville, Texas, there's a sign, there was a sign anyway that said at the train depot you know, "The blackest land the whitest people."  That's what you saw, that's sort of the announcement of you know that's what the town was all about back then. And she just, I think she, she and all of her, you know all the black folks in the town would just go, hmm, you know.  Just, I think that sign was just to keep them in their--
Speaker 1: Yeah, keep them in their place.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it reminded them of yeah, that they--I'm not sure what that sign was about.  But it was not a friendly sign.
Speaker 1: What was the educational level for your maternal parents?
Speaker 2: For my mom?  Oh, my grand mom [Kathleen Butler] in Texas, she was a teacher so I think she had a master's degree cause she taught a special education I know for a long time back when--and this is before special education was something that most people thought you should teach.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: She would--you know there were a lot of Mexican-American kids back then in West Texas who were sort of shuttled you know off into you know--you don't need to teach the Messicans (pronounced Mess-i-cans).  Everyone was the Messicans.  And my grandmother was really big on you know I think everybody needs to go to school and everybody needs to have opportunities.  And not just the Messicans but all these kids who have learning difficulties, they need to be actually taught you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They can't be just like kept in the you know, the back room.
Speaker 1: The back room, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So she was really big on that.  She had, I think she had a master's degree in I'm not sure what.  But she was a teacher you know and my grandfather--
Speaker 1: Did she--
Speaker 2: Oh I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Did she teach regular school as well as handicapped?
Speaker 2: Probably, yeah.  I mean you know back then it wasn't so you know, I mean back then there might have been a class or something.  But she was really big in the--
Speaker 1: Just so we know who we're talking about, we are talking about your mother's--?
Speaker 2: Kathleen Butler.  Yes, Kathleen Butler.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and my--
Speaker 1: I'm going to break here for a second.
Speaker 2: Oh sorry, okay.
Speaker 1: Just to change reels and--
Story_ID: 461
Speaker 1: Okay.  What we're trying to do is establish what it was like and so I wanted to hear a little bit more about your grandmother [Kathleen Butler].  She is teaching in the community--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --and your mother [Francis McMillan] is growing up and her siblings?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well my mom was the oldest of six.  So she--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Oh wait a minute, she was the oldest of six?
Speaker 2: Yeah she's the oldest of six.  And the reason why her name is spelled F-R-A-N-C-I-S, like a boy's name--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --is they had decided they were having a son.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: And she was born, they decided to keep it the same, you know.  Don't change the spelling.  Don't change--Francis of Assisi you know it's cool.  And so we'll just keep it with the F-R-A-N-C-I-S.
Speaker 1: Let's get your mother's siblings (unclear).
Speaker 2: Sure, let's see.  Okay, so there's mom, she's the oldest and Michael, he's the only boy.  And then--
Speaker 1: Michael's middle, if you know it?  If you don't--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, I don't know.  Michael, oh well I don't know, Michael McMillan.  I don't know his middle name.
Speaker 1: That's okay.
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Your mother, Michael and next?
Speaker 2: And then, darn, I'm going to get this wrong cause I always think that they're going to be mad at me cause my aunts think--
Speaker 1: No they're not.
Speaker 2: --you think I'm older than her.  But gee, I'm thinking maybe it's Kathleen, maybe Aunt Kathleen.  Kathleen, and her married name is--oh, but see now we go into the Whitlock phase.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So what is the--so it's Kathleen Whitlock.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: She's Kathleen after her mother.  Kathleen, and her married name is Anderson, with a, A-N-D--it gets a little complicated.
Speaker 1: It does.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 1: Kathleen Whitlock Anderson?
Speaker 2: Anderson.  I suppose that is her name yeah, cause her maiden name is Whitlock.  And then comes, lord help me, I know I'm going to get this wrong.  Maybe hmm, maybe Maryellen.  Maryellen, that's one M-A-R-Y-E-L-L-E-N.
Speaker 1: M-A-Y--
Speaker 2: R-Y, like Maryellen.
Speaker 1: M-A-R-Y--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, E-L-L-E-N, but it's--
Speaker 1: Two words?
Speaker 2: But, no it's all one word.
Speaker 1: Okay, one.
Speaker 2: That's what I mean about this, these elongated sort of you know.  So it's Maryellen.
Speaker 1: Maryellen.
Speaker 2: And her, she's a Whitlock also.  And her married name is Hicks.  Judge Hicks, she's a judge.
Speaker 1: Okay, in Greenville [Texas]?
Speaker 2: No, no she's a judge in--she has a practice in Houston [Texas] and in Fort Worth [Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my Aunt Kathleen is--ooh, Aunt Kathleen's a lawyer. She's in, but she's in Austin [Texas].
Speaker 1: We're not going to mention that (unclear) exactly.
Speaker 2: Okay, I'm--they're taking over the state.  If you go down to Texas, you're going to run into one of them.  And then there's Deborah, D-E-B-O-R-A-H, is the next daughter.  Deborah, and I know her middle name is Carol, Deborah Carol, cause we call her Deborah Carol.
Speaker 1: Okay, C-A-R-O-L or O-L-E?
Speaker 2: Yes, I think--ooh, that I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That I don't know.  And her, she's a Whitlock and her married name is Peoples.
Speaker 1: P-E-E--
Speaker 2: --O-P-L-E-S, like Peoples.
Speaker 1: Oh, like P-E-O--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, like Peoples.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: Like your Peoples, like People, Peoples.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the youngest is ooh, did I forget anybody?  Youngest is Natalie.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that's number six.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right number six.  Natalie and she's a Whitlock.  She kept her maiden name.
Speaker 1: Oh, she kept her maiden name.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  We have all six of your mother's, all five of your mother's siblings?
Speaker 2: Great, yes.
Story_ID: 462
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now let's go back to your grandmother [Kathleen Butler], she's teaching in the community.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And sometimes education, special education.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: What was it like, did she have to do anything else there in the community?  Has your mother ever told you what it was like growing up in that community?
Speaker 2: Well she, my mom [Francis McMillan] has told me.  My grand mom's father and mother came from East Texas around the Greenville area to West Texas, which was pretty much a frontier kind of town back then, Odessa.  And Granddaddy Bruce, my great grandfather on my mother's side was a businessman, did things like build side walks in the black community.  You know in the flats they were called, in the flats.  Was the first one to build the sidewalks and he had a barber shop and a taxi stand.  He had several businesses.
Speaker 1: Was he the first to build it in the black community or the first to build it in Odessa?
Speaker 2: Yeah, no in the--I think in the, I'm pretty sure in the black community.
Speaker 1: Okay, good enough.
Speaker 2: You know where they just had like just you know nothing, dirt sidewalk, dirt whatever.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So he built the sidewalks.  He had a taxi stand and a barber shop and several businesses.
Speaker 1: He was Mr. Black Odessa.
Speaker 2: He was Mr. Black Odessa.  And what was I going to--so--
Speaker 1: And this was--
Speaker 2: I don't know this must have been the 20s [1920s], 30s [1930s].
Speaker 1: In the 20s [1920s].
Speaker 2: 20s [1920s] and 30s [1930s].  I mean, well, it were the teens even cause if my mom was born in '34 [1934], you know my Grandma Kathleen, she must have been oh, let's see twenty.  I mean I'm not sure of her dates but, so it was somewhere in the, you know in there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, but this is to say that life for my grand mom, Kathleen Durham, Kathleen Margaret Durham was fairly nice.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  And that's--
Speaker 2: Because her father was a businessman and she was accustomed to nice things.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So things are you know relatively groovy for Grandmother Kathleen.  I mean she got an education.  She got a master's degree.  I mean her father really wanted her to--
Speaker 1: Do you know where she went to school to get her--?
Speaker 2: Darn.
Speaker 1: You don't, that's all right.
Speaker 2: Darn, I want to say I should know.  I have forgotten.  I'm sorry.  I--there's a beautiful picture of her with my grandfather, Walter McMillan on, I think she's wearing a cap and gown and it's also his graduation day because he went to medical school.  So they're like--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: You know so it's like--
Speaker 1: Walter McMillan--
Speaker 2: Went to--he, yeah cause he, there's a picture of--
Speaker 1: Was he a doctor or did he get a--?
Speaker 2: Well it gets interesting.  He was, he's a totally smart guy, also very handsome.  And the story goes people told him that he was a good looking guy and that he could have a career in Hollywood.  And so he came to Hollywood--
Speaker 1: Oh!
Speaker 2: --to have his career.  Well yes, but the family stayed behind in Odessa.  And before we knew it, you know the marriage had--
Speaker 1: Broken up.
Speaker 2: --you know kind of broken up.  So, but, and well then my grandma meet Grandpa Burt, the fellow we knew more, Burt Whitlock.  And that's the kind of the guy that we knew as granddad.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was pretty cool, originally from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  So I mean it was a good--he's handsome and you know you can make your mark, you can really be something.  And then he said okay and you know, he wanted to be a movie star.  He didn't make it as a movie star but--
Speaker 1: Did he make any movies at all that you know of?
Speaker 2: I don't think--no, I--not--
Speaker 1: Sort of lost track of him?
Speaker 2: Not, yeah not that I know of.  I don't think he--well he could well have, but I have a feeling if he had we probably would have heard all about it because--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --he was, he liked to you know--he was proud of himself and--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Mr. Whitlock, what was he like?  What was his full name, Mr. Whitlock?
Speaker 2: Albert.
Speaker 1: Albert Whitlock.
Speaker 2: Albert Whitlock.  I don't know his middle, I mean his, you know yeah his middle name, I don't know.
Speaker 1: That's okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know his dates.  I know he was originally from Philadelphia and when--and I think they met because grandma was volunteering for the USO [United Service Organizations] and he was in the service [U.S. Military].  I think cause I see, I've seen pictures of them.  He's in his uniform and you know she's like a USO, you know volunteer.
Speaker 1: USO, that sounds like World War II so we're talking about the 40s [1940s].
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Exactly, and they got married and moved up to Philadelphia for, where he was from for a little bit and lived up there.  Lived in Texas for a while but then also moved up to Philadelphia, Germantown.  I remember them talking about how they used to live in Germantown.  He was a really cool guy.  A really, really neat guy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did your grandmother take the children with her?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, they all moved up there and I remember--I mean they loved Germantown because it was an integrated, you know it was Philadelphia so it was--they got to live with all different kinds of people and they really enjoy, I mean they partly enjoyed it and partly didn't like it because it wasn't what they were used to you know.  So it was that.  But my mom was oh, let's see, what was--I can't remember the exact date because I remember it was Kathleen Maryellen and Deborah and Cookie, they were--my mom might--
Speaker 1: Now Cookie was which one, Mary--?
Speaker 2: The youngest. I'm sorry Natalie, but we called her Cookie.
Speaker 1: Oh Natalie, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we called her Cookie.  Sorry yeah, Aunt Cookie, yeah.  But they were, they had more stories to tell about Philadelphia so I'm getting the feeling--cause my mom graduated from high school when she was 16 so--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --she was a good, smart you know kid and so she may have been in her first year of college when they moved you know the daughters and Albert, Grandpa Bert and grand mom might have moved up to Philadelphia when my mom had just started college.  So maybe that's--
Speaker 1: Okay.  The rest of your time your mom spent that in--
Speaker 2: In Texas.
Speaker 1: --in Texas.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Odessa.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was Greenville and then Odessa, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, she was born in Greenville and then they--Odessa.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I'm pretty sure that's--yeah, I--yeah.  Yeah because that's where all their--yeah.  I'm pretty sure.
Story_ID: 463
Speaker 1: Had your mom [Francis McMillan] talked a lot about Odessa, what it was like?
Speaker 2: I hear more from--yeah, I'm trying to think.  I'm trying--I'd love to get the dates on when they moved because--and I'm not totally sure.  I know there are a lot of, there's like Aunt Maryellen who's a judge will talk about black share--you know they were going to school in Odessa when it was segregated.  And I remember when they said, and then it was integrated and dang it wasn't any fun anymore.  You know it wasn't--they weren't thrilled about--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --because all they--you know they had friends, they had, they were the captain of the cheerleading squad or the captain of the debate society you know and they had to you know--
Speaker 1: They were big fish in a little pond.
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly.
Speaker 1: And as that pond grew--
Speaker 2: Exactly and they weren't--
Speaker 1: --they became little--yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they weren't who they used to be and they didn't have their friendship groups and all that.  So they weren't thrilled about it.  And I'm trying to think, my mom you know she went to college in '52 [1952] maybe, '50 [1950] maybe.  I'm not sure.  So--
Speaker 1: Supreme court decision [Brown v. Board of Education, Topeka, Kansas, 1954]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --came down in '54 [1954].
Speaker 2: Exactly.  So I think, you know so she was before, you know she was already in college then so I'm thinking she must have--I'm not exactly sure when they like moved out and all this--
Speaker 1: But her sibling, especially Natalie, Aunt Cookie--
Speaker 2: Right.  Yeah and Aunt Deborah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --would be complaining about it because they would still--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and Aunt Maryellen and Aunt Kathleen.
Speaker 1: --they were the ones it hurt or hit hardest--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think so.
Speaker 1: --by the Supreme Court Decision.
Speaker 2: Yeah and it was, it wasn't you know--it wasn't--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know I would want to hear their take on it you know but it wasn't like, yay, hooray for them you know.  I'm sure for a lot of people it was a great day and I think for the country and the world it was a great day.  But on a personal level to a kid who's in high school you know who one day, you know one year was the you know and then has to, you know I think it was difficult.  Think it was very difficult.  So--
Speaker 1: Right, and it would have to be.  I know a number of people that expressed dismay over the coming of the desegregation.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Has your mother talked about any highlights or episodes in her life growing up there prior to going to--because she went to, she would at least be going to high school I guess--
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: --in Odessa?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm trying to think.  She--I'm trying to think of things she might have--
Speaker 1: When (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Just personal, I mean you know traveling, photographers.  I'm just thinking of what, pictures, traveling, photographers.  She would travel around with ponies and they'd dress the kids up in cowboy outfits and you know obviously I have this great picture of my mom in a cowgirl outfit on a pony you know.  And it's like this traveling, these traveling people would travel around.  I'm trying to think, not off the top of my head but maybe later I'll remember things.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And we can come back.
Speaker 2: Just, it's just family, I mean mostly like the--her, you know Granddaddy Bruce with the sidewalks and his barber shop and his taxi stand and how my mom would you know be the dispatcher you know on weekends, you know.  The little kid sitting on the telephone book like calling out the numbers so you know she really got a kick out of that.
Speaker 1: And pretty much your family, your mom's family would have been considered middle class, middle income?
Speaker 2: I would think so.  I mean my, you know my mom--my grand mom was a teacher.  My grand dad before he went to Hollywood was a student or a doctor.  I'm never sure like what he did after med--I think he graduated and then kind of didn't really want to be a doctor.  His father was a doc--see this is a--the story is, so I, if I could find that picture from Aunt Eva, the picture is you know right out of some kind of like you know--everyone in beautiful suits and tie and standing in a beautiful--the mother, the grandmother and the dress and the--so like this beautiful like family photograph.  Everyone's very hmmm, that's Walter McMillan's family and they're all very posh and the patriarch of the family is Dr. McMillan and he founded the black hospital in Dallas [Texas].  And so it's like ho-ho-ho, hoity-toity people.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And my, you know the Durhams are the business people and very well respected and Kathleen Durham marries Walter McMillan but Walter McMillan kind of nay, kind of wants to hang out.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So it kind of didn't work out.  But the family photograph was very like ho-ho-ho.
Speaker 1: But they were middle income--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --because they weren't going out having to pick cotton or going--
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: --into homes where they had to keep other peoples' homes clean and so forth.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Exactly, yeah they were, I think they were pretty happening you know.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: I mean not happen--I said that wrong but yeah they didn't have to do service in peoples' homes.  I mean my father's side of the family is--they did.  My grandma in Chicago [Illinois] was in service in peoples' homes.
Speaker 1: Right, because they were much poorer.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and even though Mr., what we call, we call him Mr. Smith.  That was, it's funny what you call people, Mr. Smith.  Even though Mr. Smith was a Pullman porter and they lived very nicely my grandma did do washing and she scrubbed floors.  She had a third grade education so it was a different kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 464
Speaker 1: The--okay, your mom is now going off--she had not met your father yet.
Speaker 2: No, no, she was sixteen and she was a smart kid.  And so they sent her to college, you know.
Speaker 1: And what college did she go off to?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know, Texas--I forget.  This is why.  The--she was 16 you know so she's smart enough to go to college.  Well her mom said you know, oh you're not going to go very far.  So initially they sent her to a little tiny college right nearby.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know like a junior college or something just to, so she--yeah, cause she was 16 so they didn't want her going far.  And then she was like the homecoming queen.  You know she was a ho-ho-ho, she was having (unclear).  And then she said well now can I go to, you know a bigger college and they sent her to Southern University in Baton Rouge and that's where she met my dad [Donald Roderick Parks].
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  So she was, so I guess she entered Southern University as a junior I want to say, but she was young.  Again, she was you know she was like two years younger than everybody still.  And that's where my dad, my dad went to Southern for four years on I want to say a football scholarship.  But something tells me he went on a football scholarship but maybe not.  Maybe he just played football.  I'm not sure.  He was good.  He was very good in sports so yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what year are we talking about?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: We're past the World War II now?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah it's like '54 [1954].
Speaker 1: In the early 50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: Yeah, '52 [1952], 3 [1953], 4 [1954], so I'm not quite sure when they grad--wait a minute.  My mom said either this year or next year is going to be her like 40th reunion or is that right, 50th reunion?
Speaker 1: Oh the 50th?
Speaker 2: So, of her college so--
Speaker 1: If it was fifty then that she would have had--
Speaker 2: Or would have been forty--
Speaker 1: '56 [1956].
Speaker 2: '56 [1956], that yeah okay.  So I think--
Speaker 1: And if it was forty it would have been '66 [1966].
Speaker 2: No, okay well it wasn't forty cause we were born.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --it was the 50th, right it would have been the 50th--maybe this year or next year I'm not sure which one.  But so it was around then.  So it was like '56 [1956], '57 [1957], they graduated from college.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I think they, either they graduated in the same year or she was one year behind him although there's three years apart.  She was you know she went to school early.  So--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And he was in ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps.], so I think soon after that he went to Korea you know somewhere in there.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think they were married when he went to Korea or they wrote letters back and forth.  Anyway they--so I, I mean I'm asking you.
Speaker 1: No, no, let me--
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: I can remember the '52 [1952], '53 [1953].  I can even tell you the quarterback of the Southern U--
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: Braden.
Speaker 2: Really?  Really?
Speaker 1: He was a national hero cause he was so good.
Speaker 2: Really?  Really?  I'm going to ask my mom about him.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: Altheus Braden (ph.)--
Speaker 2: Really?  Really?
Speaker 1: --decided not to go to--that was his younger brother.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  Okay, wow.  Oh that's great.  Oh I got to tell my mom.
Speaker 1: They owned the Pelican Cab Company in New Orleans [Louisiana].
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh wow.  All right.
Speaker 1: And a couple of night clubs and restaurants and so forth.
Speaker 2: Oh wow, oh that's neat.
Speaker 1: So they were a very, very well off family--
Speaker 2: Yeah, wow.
Speaker 1: --there in New Orleans.  But the--your dad comes out, your mom comes out.  They have met each other but they are not married.  They are simply dating I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, I think so.
Speaker 1: Seeing one another.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and the way they tell it, I mean this is the story my dad used to tell. He used to hang out with his friends, you know the fraternity brothers you know.  And my mom was in Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.].  She was a Delta and my dad was I forget, AK--I forget the name of his--
Speaker 1: AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's--is that a--?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Is that a men's fraternity or he was a--?
Speaker 1: It's a woman's frat--
Speaker 2: Oh it's a--so no.  So my mom was a Delta--
Speaker 1: AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc,.] is a woman's fraternity.
Speaker 2: Right, no, no so he was--she was Delta, I know that.  She was a Delta.
Speaker 1: Right, and the Alpha Phi Alpha [APA: APhiA][Fraternity, Inc.]--
Speaker 2: Oh, maybe he was an Alpha Phi Alpha--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know some--and they made all the hoo-hoo sounds.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he would hang out with his fraternity brothers and he'd tell the story, they would all hang, you know they were all--you know back when the you know young men dressed in shirts and ties everyday of the week you know.  And they were all handsome, these handsome fellows and they would hang out and check out the girls' legs.  He said, and when I saw your mother's legs, I knew that that was the girl for me.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: That was his story. So I suppose they met somehow I guess through friends and yeah he always tells it like that.
Speaker 1: And around that time we're talking about the Korean War starting around '52 [1952].
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: And he comes out of school in '56 [1956].
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: So he goes in the service.
Speaker 2: He goes into the service, yeah.  He was in ROTC and he went into the service I guess right after school.
Speaker 1: When he--graduation.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess so.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And they wrote, I know they wrote letters cause I guess when she graduated I think she went back home and she was going to get her--
Speaker 1: To Odessa?
Speaker 2: I guess, I think so.  I should, I don't know I think she--
Speaker 1: Cause about that time now she would have--during school she would have, the family would have moved to Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Philadelphia, right.  So maybe she went back, maybe, that's right maybe they were living in Philadelphia and she went to live with the family in Philadelphia and--cause I know they got married in Philadelphia.  So maybe they wrote letters back and forth while she was there and then I guess when he came home they decided to get married.  I don't know this is confusing.  I got to ask her all these questions now cause now I'm curious like how did it all happen?
Speaker 1: But your mother had fallen in love.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was a handsome guy, he was super nice.
Speaker 1: Handsome football hero.
Speaker 2: And a football guy, smart guy.
Story_ID: 465
Speaker 1: And now an officer in the Korean War?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I guess a lieutenant you know I guess--
Speaker 1: First, Second (unclear).
Speaker 2: --that's the way you start out, yeah.  And you know he [Donald Roderick Parks] wanted a career in the army [U.S. Army] and--cause it's funny. I remember you know my mom [Francis McMillan]--he never said this but my mom would always say it was, it wasn't because he was a gung ho like army guy who liked to run around and shoot people or anything.  You know like some guys are like that you know.  But it was always because he, because the army, what did--oh, cause, right.  During Korea didn't they pass that--who was the president, Truman [U.S. President Harry S. Truman, 1945-1953], Eisenhower [U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower. 1953-1961]?
Speaker 1: Truman.
Speaker 2: Didn't they desegregate the army?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: They just desegregated the army.
Speaker 1: He ordered the army desegregated.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  And, exactly so my dad--
Speaker 1: Because of Mary Margaret (ph.) Bethune [Mary McLeod Bethune].
Speaker 2: Oh, wow!  Right. Right.
Speaker 1: Yes.  She was one who influenced it.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.  My dad figured that it was the best deal out there because the law, the government had just ordered the army desegregated and it wasn't happening in the private sector.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: My dad was like well if I'm going to get a fair shake, you know I think this might be you know a place for me to you know have my career.  Later he became a professor in the university and all that, but that was after he retired.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that's why my mom says he was attracted to the army.
Speaker 1: So he spent how many years in the army?
Speaker 2: Gee, like twenty or maybe a little more.  But I think about--
Speaker 1: Yeah, he could get out and retire obviously (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think he put in twenty.  Yeah, I'm pretty sure he, cause he I want to say graduated.  He retired in 1981 maybe.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: '82 [1982], yeah so it was, maybe it was longer.  I don't know, but anyway--
Speaker 1: Okay.  If he retired in 1981 that would, after twenty years prior would be '61.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.  Oh okay, well then it was more because he was definitely in ROTC [Reserve Officers Training Corps].
Speaker 1: Okay, and ROTC counts toward the retirement.
Speaker 2: Oh does it really?  Okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So what year did they get married?
Speaker 2: I know, gosh I'm failing on this.  My sister knows all these.
Speaker 1: That's okay, just asking.
Speaker 2: No, no, no they say they--I don't know, I can't remember.  I can't remember.  But they would have been married for--I think they had their 40th anniversary when he was living, '97 [1997].  I can't remember.  Okay, I don't know.  But I remember it was on the 28th of December.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: But I can't remember the year.
Speaker 1: Some year.
Speaker 2: Yeah it was soon after--
Speaker 1: But he was in the army.
Speaker 2: --I think it was after he came back from Korea.  That's my guess.  And then he was stationed in Germany you know.  And I remember my mom took a boat over to Germany to be with him, you know a boat in December.  They had the honeymoon you know in New York and they hung out.  And then he took a boat--I mean she took a boat.  He I guess flew on one of those army planes, she took a boat.
Speaker 1: The war ended in '54 [1954].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I was--had received my orders to go to Korea.
Speaker 2: Oh okay, wow.
Speaker 1: And I got all of my shots and I was all packed and ready to go and it was over.
Speaker 2: Wow, lucky you.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Lucky.  That's lucky.  I don't think it was, yeah I don't think it was a great thing to do.  Well I think it was hard.  It was hard, yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: --they got married at the end of, some time after the Korean War.
Speaker 2: I would guess.  That was '50 [1950]--
Speaker 1: So let's say '55 [1955].
Speaker 2: '55 [1955], yeah cause let's see, '95 [1995] would be forty years.  Seems like it was around there yeah cause they, think they had their 40th anniversary when he was still relatively well, cause he had Parkinson's for--you know in ten years, he was ill for ten years.  So I think yeah.
Speaker 1: And, but when they got married they initially lived in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] or did they--?
Speaker 2: No, no, no because they moved, cause again he was stationed in Germany.  They got married in Philadelphia cause there's where my mom and all the--I mean my mom--my grandma and Albert you know her second husband and all the siblings.
Speaker 1: Children went?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So that's where they got married.  But then I guess he went to Germany and then she followed so I think they lived, initially in Germany, that's right because she tells me stories about how she was--it had groups of women who were in charge of like, if you know--cause you know it was very like the Communist sector.  The East/West Berlin was very (unclear).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So they had groups of women who were sort of, who were trained in sort of leading the families to a safe place or whatever.  So she was some kind of, she was in charge of like you know if the war broke out between the Communists or whatever, she was in charge of this women's like battalion, you know wives you know who would like drive their cars through the mountains to get to Switzerland--
Speaker 1: Switzerland, right.
Speaker 2: --or wherever they were going, you know, or France or whatever it was.  They had this whole like battle plan you know thing.  And she, so it was you know, it was nuts, it was crazy.  But I think they had fun in Europe I think.  They toured around a lot.  There are lots of pictures.  They're in you know what is that place, the Piazza, Venice [Italy], you know.
Speaker 1: In Venice, right.
Speaker 2: They're in Venice and the birds and you know all the pigeons flying around.
Speaker 1: They tell me that's great duty to serve over there.
Speaker 2: Yeah and they, I mean in the 50s [1950s] you know when it was still, everything was you know just beautiful and the people were very welcoming to Americans.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: More so than now I guess, but it was really a joy to travel.  They did a lot of traveling.
Speaker 1: And you were born--?
Speaker 2: In '63 [1963], yeah.
Speaker 1: In '60 [1960]--
Speaker 2: So they moved back.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: They moved back in 1960 shortly before my sister was born.  And then they moved from Germany to Fort Knox, Kentucky and they were stationed there for three years.  So my sister was born and then just before they were to be transferred to Greensboro [North Carolina], I was born in Fort Knox and then we traveled to Greensboro.
Speaker 1: Okay, we're going to change tapes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 466
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: --scheduled four hours, but (unclear) Robert Guillaume.  We went his entire interview in one day and we went seven hours.
Speaker 1: Wow!  Wow!  He's a man of stamina.
Speaker 2: I mean we stopped, went to lunch there in the place where we were shooting.
Speaker 1: Wow!  Wow!
Speaker 2: And Robert wanted a cocktail pretty much so we interviewed--he fell asleep. (BRIEF INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: Okay, we're up to speed.
Speaker 2: Oh we're up to speed?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, well I got to tell you, this is the, an exciting part--
Speaker 1: Okay, you're in Greensboro [North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: --cause it's the first thing I remember.  No before we got to Greensboro.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: This is exciting.  Okay, no, no, no cause I'm born now.  I'm little, I'm born.  I was born, we had to--the story that I was told when I was born, on the 10th of May when army [U.S. Army] personnel are out in the field, you know they go out to do their army exercises you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I mean not exercises but you know tank maneuvers.
Speaker 1: Right maneuvers.
Speaker 2: My dad [Donald Roderick Parks] was a tank commander and he was 6'4" and to get into a tank if you're 6'4" you know was difficult.  But anyway he loved the machinery and what not.  So he's a tank commander.  They're out in the field doing their army exercises and my mom [Francis McMillan], meanwhile is having me and he has to come in from the field in his army uniform you know to, to say hey to the baby.  We, shortly after that maybe a month after or maybe two months, we take off driving for North Carolina, his new assignment, Greensboro, North Carolina.  And I'm riding in the back seat, there weren't car seats back then you know.  They just, I guess you just put the baby in the back seat lying down, you know head facing the window.  So I see tree, sky, tree, sky, tree sky.  I'm not on my mother's lap because--
Speaker 1: You're two months old now.
Speaker 2: Two months old--because my mom has on her lap a shot gun because it's 1963.  We're traveling from Fort Knox, Kentucky through a part of the South to Greensboro, North Carolina and it's very dangerous.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So you have to be--and my dad is wearing his army uniform because the wisdom was you know show everyone that you're in the service and they won't bother you.
Speaker 1: They will hesitate more.
Speaker 2: And that--yeah, they will hesitate more, exactly.  And if that doesn't work have your wife hold a shotgun.  So my mom is literally riding shotgun up in the car as we travel along and I could see sky, trees, sky trees.
Speaker 1: You could remember that?
Speaker 2: I, that's, yeah that's the first thing I remember sky, trees, sky, trees, sky trees for hour--and I love you know till this day I love--riding in the car is incredibly relaxing.  We traveled quite a bit when I was a kid but that was, that's my first--that was so exciting.  I always wondered why was I like in the back you know and I always asked my mom why I was in the back? And for years, she didn't tell me.  And then we were hanging out I think one year with my husband Paul [Oscher] and we're hanging out and she kind of mentions you know, I guess I was old enough to know then.  Oh, well I had a, I was carrying a gun because it was dangerous.  And I just stopped and was like, you never told me that you know kind of thing.  So--
Speaker 1: And where was your sister?
Speaker 2: Oh she was in the back seat too, you know.
Speaker 1: She was in--okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was what, three or something.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: She was, you know she had I guess her seat belt on and what not and she was probably holding me you know cause she, you know we got along from day one so--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --she was like probably visiting with me and cheering me up and making me laugh or something.
Speaker 1: Wonderful.  That was wonderful.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And how long did the family live in Greensboro?
Speaker 2: Maybe two years.  I'm not quite sure.  My brother was born.  Maybe two years, maybe three years and then I believe we moved back to--no.  Oh well, right, that was then we moved across to Fort Ord [California].  And then we moved--
Speaker 1: Okay, California.
Speaker 2: Fort Ord, California, my dad's next assignment.  And then it was, yeah then it was 1968 and we moved, and we lived here at Fort Ord, California for maybe you know two years.  You know the assignments are about two years long or--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And then we moved, then my, we moved--I mean my dad basically took us to, it was 1968.  My dad took us to Texas where we lived with my grand mom and my mother's family while he went over to Vietnam.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right, so yeah.
Speaker 1: You seem to be very much aware of just going by the trip to Greensboro experience.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 467
Speaker 1: Were you aware of some of the demonstrations and issues in that '64 [1964]/'68 [1968] period?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was, you know I was born the year of the March on Washington.  And I don't, I mean I was a baby and we were moving.  I remember in (unclear), in you know, later on my parents [Donald Roderick Parks] [Francis McMillan] spoke of like wanting to go but not going because they had just moved, you know they--I think we were moving that summer.  You know we were going to Greensboro [North Carolina] while everyone else was going up to Washington.  I do remember that when Kennedy [U.S. President John F. Kennedy, 1961-1963] was shot my parents did go up for that when we weren't you know moving.  So they I think drove all night with some friends, stood in line and back then with the women wearing high heels.  I remember my mom stood in line and my dad stood in line with their friends you know cause to process by his coffin.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: They said and you never cried.  You were, cause I was--they were all hold, they--my mom was holding me the whole time.  Well passing me off to the friends you know cause I was this heavy baby.  They said you never cried.  I'm like, glad I could help you know.  But all the protests and stuff, no they weren't, you know because they were in the military they weren't involved in the--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: I mean back then, I know it's different now but back then if you were in the military for the most part you weren't one of the folks who would go--
Speaker 1: Protest, right.
Speaker 2: --on the marches, yeah.  You, and you know the--I think it's, you can't.  I think back then, I might be getting this wrong but you didn't speak out against your country if you were in the military.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And it was ironic because you know in '63 [1963] when we're traveling to Greensboro, my dad's in his uniform hoping that you know people hesitate before they you know throw things at him because you know we're of African descent driving through the south in '68 [1968].  In '69 [1969], this is the opposite.  He's in his uniform hoping they don't throw things at him because he's in his uniform.  So it was a very difficult time for someone like my dad because he was just trying to you know do the right thing and get by.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Keep on keeping on you know, and the rules keep changing for someone like him.  But it was very volatile.  I mean it was (unclear) yeah, 1968, I remember we went from Fort Ord [California] toward Texas to the Grand Canyon.  There are lots of pictures of us standing at the Grand Canyon and it was December, 1968.  And there was a whole hell of a lot going on.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: And, but we--you know my parents didn't you know they were sort of trying to just keep sort of--I mean they were in this army thing.  It's a strange bind where sometimes you have to bind to something that you don't completely believe in I think.
Speaker 1: Right.  Now--
Speaker 2: So, yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to get promotions and so forth the safe way was you did not join in those things.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think, I mean I think like [General] Colin Powell, like I mean some of these men who are you know career army men or even career army women where you--also because you know three or four years or five years before it was the best thing that could possibly happen for a black man.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So five years later it's now the evil thing?  You know how can this be and who is making up these definitions?  And so you know I choose to believe what I choose to believe and--
Speaker 1: Well regardless of what your beliefs are you keep them to yourself.
Speaker 2: Right, well that's--
Speaker 1: Because it's going to impact you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --adversely as opposed to a private citizen.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.  And you know, so often they're just, I got the feeling they were just looking for a reason to you know I--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I mean so you know just try to stay the course, you know keeping you know, keep going forward because times were very confusing you know so anyway.
Story_ID: 468
Speaker 1: Now your mother [Francis McMillan], was she a housewife during that period or did she teach (unclear) work?
Speaker 2: She, no.  She got her master's degree.  When we were in Greensboro [North Carolina], mom got her masters degree in I want to say sociology at A&T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical University, Greensboro], is that--?
Speaker 1: North Carolina A&T, yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in Greensboro, is that--?
Speaker 1: It is.
Speaker 2: She was--one of her students was Jessie Jackson.
Speaker 1: Okay, he was there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, who she would say he had a mouth on him.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But yeah she was, I mean cause she was again she was very young to be a teacher and she was a woman you know and he was just a sassy kid I think.  But she remembers him very well.
Speaker 1: Now was she teaching prior to getting her master's or was--?
Speaker 2: She may have been, I'm not quite sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, but mostly she was staying at home and being a housewife?
Speaker 2: Well I--yeah, you know see I, no I remember her, I remember we would go to school and there were like ladies who would take care of us cause mom was, she worked.  She wasn't a stay at home mom that I can remember.  I mean her career path is a little more you know hop and skip and jump because she had to basically create her career alongside of my dad's which was move here, get transferred, go here, go to Vietnam, go here, go here.  She had to kind of create a career alongside that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And it was hard to you know get things like tenure or whatever if you're always moving.  But no I always remember her working.  I don't, I mean she was, you know she would cook beautiful dinners and I mean her forte is sort of the beautifully laid table and you know it's all gorgeous and all that.  But I don't remember her as a housewife.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she would always like teach and come home and then do the beautiful dinner or beautiful fun birthday party or you know all this, you know it was all--or when she had--we would always go on adventures.  She was big on like, let's go to visit the--she still is like this.  Let's go to visit the Harriet Tubman home in--you know cause she lives in upstate New York.  Let's go and visit Harriet Tubman's house.  You know and we'll drive out to Harriet Tubman's, I mean she's big on like going to historical things.
Speaker 1: Sites.
Speaker 2: And crafts fairs of the women, what the ladies in the Freedom Quilting Bee.  Let's go and visit the ladies of the Freedom Quilting Bee and we drive to the ladies of the Freedom Quilting Bee.  I mean she's--we're always in the car going on some adventure when she had the time, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It would be fun.
Speaker 1: And you, your sister and your brother--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --had experienced all of these things?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.  And when we weren't like going off on some like historical you know jaunt to see you know something, I don't know what, we would be hang--cruising in our neighborhood because she loved as her mother, as grand mom in Texas, junk.  So we would be you know like in, on garbage day, you know back then when people would put out nice stuff.  You see it now on antiques road show?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Well before antiques road show there was, people got tired of something and they'd put it out on the corner.  My mom and her mother and interestingly enough my husband all loved it.  They loved to cruise around and go wow, look at that on the side of the road!  Someone threw it out!  Quick--
Speaker 1: Let's get it.
Speaker 2: --jump out of the car.  We would hide in the car, my mom would run out there and haul in the most beautiful antiques.  So many antiques we have, my mom has like found them in like junk stores or on the corner and stuff.  So--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And her mother too has beautiful antiques in the house that she's just sort of found you know and some of it she's purchased.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: And some from her Granddaddy Bruce.  But lots of just found things, you know.
Speaker 1: Wow that's fantastic.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's pretty fun.  Pretty fun, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 469
Speaker 1: So she was active.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Your dad [Donald Roderick Parks] of course was pursuing his career in the  [U.S.] military.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And you, your sister, your brother were growing up in Greensboro [North Carolina] and Fort Ord, California.
Speaker 2: Fort Ord then Texas.  We went to Catholic school in Texas, uniforms.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any highlights there that you can remember?
Speaker 2: My first award I got was a perfect attendance award.
Speaker 1: Oh, wonderful!
Speaker 2: Which doesn't sound like much but I think of it, I look back on that award now and think that the first award I got was for showing up.  And that's the core of my practice today.  Show up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's, you know what I mean?  If you just show up then everything else will become much easier.  You know if you hem and haw, oh I don't feel like writing today, oh I don't feel like such and such, right, then the work will never get done.  But if you commit to showing up, you've got like 80% of the problem taken care of.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: And showing up on time?
Speaker 2: Well that was my other big, you know--I wasn't so--at the time, well the time had to coordinate with my sister and brother getting in the car so--but yeah, showing up on time, yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, any other highlights there in your elementary, junior high?
Speaker 2: Gee.
Speaker 1: High school?
Speaker 2: Gosh, well gee, elementary school I mean we moved around, again we moved around which we moved from, we were in Texas, dad came back from Vietnam.  We went again to Fort Knox [Kentucky] for a second tour at Fort Knox.  I had the, I--my big highlight there, I was in second grade.  I did this science project.  I loved collecting rocks.  And I did this elaborate science fair project where I found rocks and labeled them and stuff.  And it was so good that none of the teachers believed I actually did it because it was so--I mean it wasn't much but it was so different you know.  I mean it was, you know who would go around and collect--what second grader goes around and collects rocks and like you know catalogs them and all this stuff?  Anyway they didn't believe I had done it.  So I had to have my mom [Francis McMillan] and dad write a note, she really did this science project all by herself.  The only thing my dad did to help was type out the labels, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But anyway, but collecting rocks is something that I've been, I used to be very interested in.  And I think it ties into my interest in history or you know the old stuff.  What else?  And we lived, we--after Fort Knox, we moved to Germany.  I mean no, we moved to Vermont where my dad got his master's.  He took two years off from the army.  We moved to where is it Burling, Vermont, University of Vermont in Burlington and he got his master's degree there in education.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then we moved to Germany.  He got, you know he joined or whatever, got back in the army, I'm not sure.  And then he took two years off.  And then he went, we went to Germany and that's where my parents sent me to German junior high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you went to German Junior High as opposed to--?
Speaker 2: To American Junior--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --right with the Germans.
Speaker 1: Because you had educational facilities on base?
Speaker 2: Yes, there were American high schools and junior high schools and what not.  All schools for Americans, but my parents thought that it would be a wonderful idea for me--my sister was a little older.  She was in high school so they thought, well don't disrupt her high school you know cause she was on her way to college.  But the younger kids, me and my brother should go to German Schools with the Germans.  We didn't speak a word of German, not a word.  Well maybe you know, Guten Tag, you know but that's not going to get you very far.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Or hoita (ph.) is the, you know the--crazy.  So, but she sent, they sent us to German school and well we didn't speak a word of German for about three months and then it was almost as if you could inhale it.  I felt it was like it came--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --the language came through like right through your nose, right into your brain, bang!  And I was totally fluent.  It was the strangest thing.
Speaker 1: Just like that?
Speaker 2: It was weird, just like that.  I was this little German speaking person.  And we did that for a little while, then we went back to, we moved back to Maryland, the States where my dad was stationed in the, his next assignment and we went back to American schools.
Speaker 1: What, where was he stationed?
Speaker 2: It was Aberdeen Proving Ground where they tested--I don't know what they were proving but--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --it was something.
Speaker 1: Different arsenal things.
Speaker 2: Yeah that's it.  That's it, and in Maryland and I graduated from high school in Maryland.
Speaker 1: Where?  What--?
Speaker 2: At John, the John Carol School, it's a Catholic School.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My parents are Catholic.  I was Catholic too once, but I drifted.
Speaker 1: And so you were, you graduated from high school in the Catholic School there?
Speaker 2: Yes.  In '81, [1981], 1981 I graduated.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm just trying to remember what 1981 was like there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Reagan [U.S. President Ronald Reagan, 1981-1989].
Speaker 1: I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: Reagan.  Reagan elected in 1980.
Speaker 1: Yes, he did.
Speaker 2: Ronald Reagan and lots of budget cuts to things that people were sort of starting to go, what's going on, you know?  It was a time of--I mean that was, you know Jimmy Carter [U.S. President Jimmy Carter, 1977-1981] had been president and it was such a--I remember it was such a great time.  People made fun of Jimmy Carter left and right but I always thought he was just amazing.  My parents you know thought he was amazing, just a wonderful, wonderful guy.  But he didn't have the slick thing you know that I suppose you need to remain in public office.  And then Reagan came in and that's when people really started to--the air traffic controllers, I remember when that happened.  And my Uncle Michael was an air traffic controller.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I remember that, you know when he, when they went on strike and then Reagan like fired them all.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That was the beginning of something different in this country and I remember that.  It was around that time you know.
Story_ID: 470
Speaker 1: Still, your parents could not be political because they would be in danger of your dad's [Donald Roderick Parks] career?
Speaker 2: Well yeah it was weird.  I mean they were political in the, in a--you know I got to say there are different ways to be political.  And I think for a black man who was born in 1934, who you know got into college, didn't have, you know was not of means at all you know, didn't come up, you know came up, you know--I mean my dad wore cardboard in his shoes.  I mean this is in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He had like one coat you know.  Even though you know Mr. Smith was a Pullman porter, they were you know there was a family to feed and they were very poor, cardboard in his shoes, one coat, very poor growing up.  And that, the fact that he made something of himself, you know and his family was very proud of him, but the fact that he had made something of himself instead of like other folks in the neighborhood that he knew who had not you know managed to go to college and those kinds of things, I think that was a political act.  I really do.  I think the, you know there--you could be like Dr. King [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and be political.  You could be like Malcolm X [Malcolm Little] and be political.  You could be like my dad and be political.  There are different--you could be like Muddy Waters and be political.  You could be like--there are so many way--or Shirley Chisholm political, Mary McLeod Bethune political.  There are many ways to be political and I think that for a poor black man to you know just make it through some of the things that he had to make, he didn't--you know my dad did not complain you know which in a way is a political act to me.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know what I mean?  I think protesting is a political act and sometimes just, you know what I'm going to be a good father. I'm going to be a good husband.  I'm going to provide for my children.  I'm not going to leave my children you know what I mean and like so many folks do.  I'm going to be there for them.  I'm going to provide a good home for them.  I mean that's an incredible political act.  And I think we forget that in the you know, in the scheme of things.
Speaker 1: I think you're absolutely right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And some people believe you can't be political unless you're loud and boisterous and that's not the true measure.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think so. [General] Colin Powell I think is, you know a great exam--I mean I, you know. But anyway there's a whole history of people who yes, we're quiet or you know.
Speaker 1: During this period you're reaching maturity and so you're forming some of your ideas.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And high school, beginning of college.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Um-hmm.  Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: What were you noticing?
Speaker 2: Gee, I was noticing that well I mean from, you know when I was small or when we were small our parents told us, you are the ambassadors of your race.  They told us that and that was kind of heavy.  You know when you're like in fifth--when I was in fifth grade my mom gave me a book by James Baldwin cause I wanted to be a writer very early on.  I was in fourth grade, I wanted to be a writer, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mom hands, my mom and dad for Christmas one year handed me a book by James Baldwin you know.  You know I'm in the fifth grade, you know they're handing me James Baldwin.  It's heavy.  You know there was a lot of, while they may have not been you know standing on the street corner you know or attending all the rallies, they were certainly saying there are things going on out there and you all you know are going to have to be aware of those things going on out there.  So they're giving me James Baldwin for Christmas and they're telling us you are the ambassadors of your race which is a heavy thing to tell someone that's in you know fourth grade.  You know not you're black and it's hard, no.  You're the ambassadors of your race which is a slightly different message.  You, you know you're going into places where people have never met black people.  In Vermont--in Vermont we would go to a place called the Champlain Valley Fair which is the, you know the fair, the big fair where you have all the what not.  People would come--and this is 1972.  People would come up to me and pat me.  They'd never seen a black person before.  They had never seen a black person before, 1972.
Speaker 1: That's not surprising.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well it was, well but it might not be surprising but I was like, whoa!  This is trippy.  I'm in fifth grade, you're petting me.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) right.
Speaker 2: And in a nice way you know, wow, look, I--petting my hair, looking at me.  This is America though.  Of course in Germany when we went to Germany which was right after the Vermont, there was a whole country of folks who had never seen a black person.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: You know and it was, you know--so but we were told you are the ambassadors of your race.  What you do--I mean basically in today's language they were saying you're representing.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know you are representing because people are going to see you and they're going to make decisions about us based--
Speaker 1: Of the race.
Speaker 2: --because of your conduct.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: You know you're representing.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: And that was heavy.  So I'm sorry, I got lost on my little train of representing.
Speaker 1: But just that seems to have impacted you that your mother telling you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well sure.  Sure, sure.
Speaker 1: --that you are an ambassador (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah and my dad.  This was their message, this was their, you know early on you are the ambassador of your--both of them would tell us that.  Would tell us all that and it was really kind of, I don't know, it was amazing to--
Story_ID: 471
Speaker 1: You said that you had always, since you were four you wanted to be a writer.
Speaker 2: In the fourth grade.
Speaker 1: In the fourth, oh the fourth grade.
Speaker 2: Fourth grad, yeah, yeah.  I don't know what I--I think when I was four I wanted to, I'm not sure what I wanted to do.  Probably nothing, but yeah.
Speaker 1: But what happened, what was the first realization that you can remember when you said oh I want to be a writer?
Speaker 2: It was--a couple of things happened.  One, I loved to like make up poems and songs out loud.  You know I was always walking around going la, la, la, you know saying silly things and I really enjoyed that.  But when I was in the fourth grade, I--we had a piano, not an upright like a baby grand you know cause my mom [Francis McMillan] and dad [Donald Roderick Parks] wanted us to learn to play the piano.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I would sit underneath it with our dog, a German shepherd back then and I would be writing.  And my mom would walk by looking for me, I was supposed to be practicing my piano, I wasn't.  She'd look underneath the piano and she'd say, Suzan-Lori what are you doing?  And I'd say, I'm writing my novel, you know.  So way back then I loved writing, I loved making up poems and songs and things like that.  So it was pretty much in the fourth grade when I knew that like that's what I wanted to do.  I mean it wasn't a smooth road of course cause in high school I had a teacher who told me, don't be a writer cause I was such a lousy speller.  So she tried to save me I suppose a life of misery and rejection by telling me to do something else kiddo.  You'd be rotten at this.  I mean it wasn't until college when I sort of got back on the writing wagon and then I had a class with James Baldwin.  So, which is great.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Great gift.
Speaker 1: I remember reading of that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So your ambition to grow up to be a writer--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --really drew upon a) that probably someone told you, you couldn't do it.
Speaker 2: Probably.
Speaker 1: And we're going to continue this line of thought because--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --this is the first realization, wakening that you're wanting to be a writer.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  It's--we could keep talking.  Oh darn.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No one's called.  Let me just--cause we can, you want to talk a little--?
Speaker 1: Well we're running out of tape.
Speaker 2: Oh we're running out of tape.  Okay, let me just see--
Speaker 1: So we will stop right here.
Story_ID: 472
Speaker 1: Let's go back to visit that sudden awakening that happened in the fourth grade.  I want to be a writer.  Tell us about some of the things that during that period that may have influenced you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's a good--
Speaker 1: --either consciously or unconsciously.
Speaker 2: That's a good--it's a good question.  I think there were three books that I remember reading at the time which I loved.  So it springs from joy basically.  I loved to, I'm the kind of kid who loved--some kids love to draw, some kids love to dance, some kids love to build things you know.  I'm the kind of kid who loves to walk around and make up little songs, la-la le-le, la-la le-le, la-la la.  I loved rhymes.  I loved making up songs and stuff.  And I read three novels at a time.  Well I read two and then I read at the third one which I'll explain to you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father [Donald Roderick Parks] says if you do something like partially you're doing at it.  So I read at the third novel.  But the first two that I read are two books for kids.  One is--
Speaker 1: And you do this at the same time?
Speaker 2: Well one and then--
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: I remember it was all kind of in that fourth grade period.  "Harriet the Spy", by I think Louise Fitzhugh.  I'm not sure of the name of the author.  "Harriet the Spy" about a girl who walks around her neighborhood with a notebook writing things down.  How cool?  How cool could that be?  The second book is called "Hotel for Dogs", was you know great works in literature which is about some kids who have, who make a hotel for all these homeless dogs which was I thought, wow, how cool is that?  So, then the third one was "Don Quixote" and my parents had like a book shelf of like classics of literature you know.  And you buy them like you do the Encyclopedia Britannica.  You know they, a different classic comes in the mail each month or whatever and most of them sat on the book shelf unread cause my parents were into sociology books and you know they loved sociology books and sort of educational books.  My dad loved books on, what is it called like, in transcendental meditation.  He loved like meditation books.  So, but the world, the classics of world literature sat unread and I would open them because they had pictures.  Don Quixote, pictures.  And I read at Don Quixote which means I read little bits of it and then looked at the pictures and read the captions a little bit, kind of how I still read right now.  So these three books I absolutely loved and I loved you know walking around the neighborhood making up rhymes and songs and stuff.  And that's--I sort of started thinking, well I'll write one of my own, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And that's how it started.  It was just from joy you know, yeah.
Speaker 1: And saying well you get so much joy from this and let's make it a career.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well sure--well in the fourth grade it's not like now where kids know--plan out their careers when they're three years old.  But back then you know you could just be a kid who loved to, who enjoyed something.  It didn't have to be a career.  Capital C you know get into Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], career, that kind of thing.  It was more like you were just like enjoying yourself.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I guess I didn't say I want to be a writer, I think I was saying I'm writing which is different you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I'm writing a novel is different from as a kid I would say I'm writing my novel, not I want to be a writer when I grow up.  It was different you know.
Speaker 1: That--now I understand something that you said in a recent Washington Post article.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: That your greatest joy is writing those plays.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And when you finish that writing, you add your enjoyment.
Speaker 2: Well pretty much yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And your audience then, it's time for them to enjoy.
Speaker 2: I have my greatest joy writing, actual, the actual you know the sort of interaction with the spirit.  And I say the spirit cause I feel it from coming over from the left side.  So the interaction with the spirit, that's my greatest joy.  That if you will, you know if you think of the sacred mountain and how in some cultures they walk around the sacred mountain as a form of prayer or devotion, writing is my walk around the sacred mountain.  Everything else is a second lap around the sacred mountain or a third lap around the sacred mountain.  But for me the first one and for me the most fulfilling one is the writing.  It's my, yeah it's my great joy.  Writing my novel same thing, when I wrote "Getting Mother's Body", it was a great--just the crafting of it was the most, yeah the most joyous aspect of it, yeah.
Story_ID: 473
Speaker 1: Now when you were in the fourth grade, what kind of writing did you do at that time?
Speaker 2: Oh silly stuff.  I have no idea.  Poems that rhyme, you know.  I was big on rhyme.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: All the poems had the rhyme and the novel, oh it was, I think it was about a cat and you know serious stuff, a cat who wanted a family and you know, it was, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So I don't know.  I mean I can't remember much about it.  But it was just--or a kid who wanted a cat and you know the kid couldn't have the cat and--it was novel though.  It wasn't a kid's book it was like a serious, you know--
Speaker 1: And when you had done it that was a great joy?
Speaker 2: Right.  Oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: You had experienced great joy.
Speaker 2: It was all, it was just for the pleasure of writing, yeah.  And we also had a newspaper.   That's right, my brother and I had a newspaper called "The Daily Daily."  And everyday really, we as you can tell, we typed it up in the attic cause we had this huge house in Vermont.  It was on old--Fort Ethan Allen was the neighborhood and it was an old--so there were old houses I guess that the big army officers back in the day lived in huge, enormous houses with servant staircases and huge attics you know.  So we would hang out in the attic which we could have a view of the entire neighborhood.  And my brother and I would write The Daily Daily you know, and we'd each take turns typing it up because that was the hardest part you know.  Making up the story, doing the reporting was easy but to actually like you know--even when you're--I was in the fourth grade, he was in the third.  Or I was in the what, fourth grade he was in the second grade.  I was in the fifth grade, he was in the third grade.  Actually doing the typing was the hard part.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I remember he was a better typist than I was, but anyway so we did, you know had this newspaper everyday.  It lasted for you know a couple of months I think.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but not every day.  I mean we got a little spotty on it but--
Speaker 1: But you needed your high there--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --on the writing so even though the newspaper only lasted a few months--
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh sure.
Speaker 1: --you continued to write.
Speaker 2: Oh sure, I continued to write but not in a sort of like--I tell you, you know it was different then than it is these days.  A kid could just enjoy something you know.  And you could be a writer and do writing for you know three years or four years or off and on or enjoy it whenever it came up in schools, a writing assignment and love it.  But you didn't have to decide at the age of ten or twelve that you were going to be a writer when you grew up.  I didn't decide.  No, no, no, I didn't decide.  I decided that I loved writing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It wasn't until much later than I decided that I wanted to be a writer as a career, two very different things.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.
Speaker 2: In high school I knew that I wanted to study English literature in high--in college and that I wanted to write, you know be a writer.  But that was when the teacher said you know, you're such a poor speller you wouldn't make a good writer.  And again I said okay fine.  You know I was very good in science.  I was good in physics.  I used to ace my physics exams--
Speaker 1: Oh!
Speaker 2: --in high school.  And I, you know so I enjoyed chemistry and stuff so I thought well, I can do science, you know.  I don't need to be a writer.  I can do science.  And so then--but when I went to college and found that science really wasn't my thing, I got back into writing and--well took an English class, got back into--Virginia Wolf was a, is a great writer and I really felt like wow, this is what I love!  So why don't I just do what I love.  And at that time I was thinking more career, you know I'll be a writer.  You know that's what I'll do with my life.  But in the fourth grade I was thinking, I'll have fun, which is different.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Something that you said there was that reading Virginia Wolf became fun for you.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: So not only writing that gave you the joy but reading that gave you the joy.
Speaker 2: Right, oh yeah reading, yeah, yeah.  Oh yeah, oh definitely.  You know "Harriet the Spy", "Hotel for Dogs", "Don Quixote", the James Baldwin "Nikki Giovanni Dialogue" that my parents gave me.  Gee, anything.  I mean I loved reading, still do you know. (Brief Interruption)
Story_ID: 474
Speaker 1: Okay.  So in the fourth grade you found yourself reaching these highs on reading and writing.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And you and your brother had a "Daily Daily" for a few months.
Speaker 2: "Daily Daily" yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And were there other ways that you expressed that writing--?
Speaker 2: No it was mostly, I don't--I can't remember there being any like school groups or anything.  I mean I wasn't, I was never on the school newspaper.  I mean I was very much, I would say throughout my high school and junior high and--I was very much like one of the outsider.  I had a brief like moment of popularity.  I was on the cross country team and we won like national championships or whatever.  And I was in 7th grade or 8th grade, I was a cheerleader, you know but brief little moments.  But I was mostly on the sort of outside watching what was going on.  So, but I always loved reading, I always--when we had to memorize poems like in the 6th grade you know, I loved that kind of thing you k now.  Just, that was sort of my great joy to memorize a poem and you know because you memorize the poem and you get the rhythm of the writing in your body you know.  What is it, does the elephant remember in the great light before dawn--I can't remember the rest.  But I remember the last line is, "does the elephant remember?  Does he turn himself and dream of the long forgotten music of the long forgotten stream?"  And that was the 6th grade and I remember that.  Does he turn--because it was about an elephant in a circus and how he was you know caged and he--does he remember anything or does he turn, as he turned himself and dream of the long forgotten music of the long forgotten stream.  And I always would be like that's so cool, you know.  So I loved how writing you know could move you really.  Yeah, so I just, yeah I at first just loved it you know instead of just wanting to do it.  I mostly just adored it.
Speaker 1: Give us an example of some of the things that you know by heart from 6th grade.
Speaker 2: Uh-oh, oh no.  Oh, from 6th grade!  I have no memory.  Let's see, 6th grade.  Gee, 6th grade I was trying to learn--well we were in Germany and I was trying to learn German.  That was a poem, that one poem is what I remembered.  There's nothing else.  I remember my, we had a, like a potluck thing where your parent, your mom was supposed to cook you know a--and the kids were supposed to bring in a dish for the class.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so you know you say to the teacher, my mom is going to make (makes sounds) whatever, right.  And so my mom [Francis McMillan] had said, I'll make barbecued spare ribs.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And I was like you don't know how to make barbecued spare ribs, right, cause I never--I didn't know my mom knew how to make barbecued spare ribs, you know.  And she said oh yes I do.  She made the best barbecued spare ribs.  I was popular that one, you know one moment.  I was the kid who brought in a plate of barbecued spare ribs and the kids were like going wild.  And I was like, dang.  Cause my mom you know the teacher who could always throw a great party but you know the idea that she could make like something like barbecued spare--
Speaker 1: So she was also a great cook?
Speaker 2: She could turn out the barbecue spare ribs and make her kid look good you know on the Christmas banquet or whatever it was.  But I don't remember much other, whoo, sorry I'm thinking--
Speaker 1: That's okay.
Speaker 2: --of other literature.  There's a story about from--we had, you know we had those readers you know.  In 6th grade you have those readers.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: We had this reader with a pink flamingo on the cover and the reader was called "How It Is Now-a-days."  That was the reader, the 6th grade reader.  And there was a story in there called "Aqui Esta Mi Nieta" which (unclear) I didn't even know what it meant, you know.  And I always wanted to Aqui Esta Mi Nieta, because that (unclear) that rhymes.  Little did I know I was ruining the Spanish.  Where is my child [sic] [Here is my Grandson], I think?  Or where is my--well I still don't know what it means.  But it was a story about a lost child.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Probably going to have to edit that.
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: But I don't remember, yeah I don't remember so much.
Speaker 1: I thought I was going, had gone through some of the same experiences as you were going through and there were poems that I thought I was very, very smart in being able to repeat and learn them well so that I could show off.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And then my older son did the same thing.
Speaker 2: Of course.
Speaker 1: I'd have company and he'd walk right into the middle of the living room--
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: --and just start repeating some very difficult poems and so forth.
Speaker 2: Wow.  Oh wow he could--see that's an orator.  See I was more of like a secret like word junkie.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I was a little more of a, you know I would go underneath the piano and write, you know.  I mean I was more of a like, I would go up into the attic and write.  Although it was a newspaper, it was more like a, you know kind of a go into you know, pull you know pull back--not sit, stand in the middle of the room and recite.  I wasn't--no, no.  I was more like a, enjoying sort of just the rhythms and the flavors and the textures of language.  I was a little less public with it, you know.
Speaker 1: Right, less public.
Speaker 2: And little yeah, yeah, little more like, I don't know.  It was somewhat kind of intoxicating rhythmic thing that was, I don't know.  It was a little--I didn't understand it you know.  I wasn't, I mean I was comfortable standing in front of people reciting a poem but that was for school.  You know that was a school thing.  I wouldn't do it just for fun, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, but that's cool though.  I wish I had.
Story_ID: 475
Speaker 1: Your first written poetry or play that you have retained to this day.
Speaker 2: Oh gee, well or short story, would that count?
Speaker 1: Or short story, yes.
Speaker 2: One of the first ones was called "The Wedding Pig", and I wrote it in college.  Well I mean the little things I wrote in, as a kid I don't know where they are.  But the first thing I remember actually keeping was called "The Wedding Pig" and I wrote it in college.  And that was important to me because I was writing the short story.  I was typing it.  I was sitting facing a--my desk was facing a window.  I was at Mount Holyoke College, typing this story.  And it was as if, it was the first time it ever happened.  It was as if people walked into the room and were standing right behind me.  And that's the first time it ever happened where I was typing a story like writing, I would--I was writing and then after maybe the first paragraph of actual me doing the writing, it actually was as if people came into the room and just took over.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And all I did was just copy down whatever they were saying.  And so I went from being a word junkie of like just loving the rhythms and language and the movement and the way the words could move you, and the characters and magical worlds and all that kind of stuff that I loved.  I used to love Greek Myths.  That was one of my first big loves.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's another book, (unclear) whatever they're called, Greek Myth--I have the book still today, another present my parents gave me.  Loved Greek myths, gods, goddesses, you know larger than life figures.  But I went from a love of just stories and rhythms and words and music to this act, total, it took it to the next level.  When you're just loving stories and rhythms and all of a sudden you're writing and it's as if people come into the room and dictate the story to you.  I was on like a total, totally other level of creating, yeah.
Speaker 1: For some reason, describing you as a playwright or screen writer almost trivializes what you really do.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 476
Speaker 1: You take words and put them together in a rhythm or a picture that goes far beyond that.  And would you agree and--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It's more like I'm a--well I happen to write plays, screen plays, novels, songs, essays, what have you.  I mean that's the fruit of the work, but that's not the--I mean that's the crust of the bounty.  That's the stuff that comes out of the cornucopia you know.  These things and then people can attend and actors can act in and people can read and enjoy and sing and dah dah dah dah.  That's all great.  It's all gravy.  But the work that I do is--you know writing is--
Speaker 1: I'm trying to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know, there's something else going on.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 2: I'm not sure what it is.  It's almost this kind of, you know back in the old days you know they would have a, you know priests, priestesses, people who are the, who sort of you know bring you know the spirit to the people and offer, and make the spirit manifest in a way that the people can then get on board and celebrate in a way that will then give praise to the spirit you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And that's kind of what I am.  I'm sort of a--
Speaker 1: That's what you do.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's kind of what I feel like I'm doing.  I may, I make these things, these products or these works you know that allow people to then have an interaction with the spirit.  Yeah that's what I, that's the kind of thing I do.  And writing, and we'll call it writing.  There are other people who you know are painters and do that.  There are people, musicians, you know they make music but actually what they're doing is just creating a way for people to have an engagement with the spirit.
Speaker 1: Exactly, and that's what you are doing with your writings.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what I feel like it.  And also my public speaking which is a very important part of what I do these days.  I go around the country and around the world talking to people about writing.  But what I'm really talking to them about is the spirit.  My tattoo it says, it's in Sanskrit, same thing written twice.  And this is small print.  And when I feel, well when I get older and have to wear glasses, I need it in big print, you know.  But it says and forgive my bad accent here, my bad--cause I don't you know, I only--I'll stumble through.  It says Ishvara Pranidhana Vu (ph.), which means a ruler's translation, a gentle translation is "follow god the inner guide."  And that's really what I'm talking about.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It's just, writing is the way that I talk about it through characters and creating scenes, creating a way for people to be, creating a place for people to be.  I mean, the plays and the film scripts and the novels and the songs are really just a clearing if you will, in the woods where people can come together and celebrate the spirit, you know so yeah.
Story_ID: 477
Speaker 1: The--are you surprised when artistic directors and various people who want you to write for them understand and accept and want your work to be, want to be a part of your work?
Speaker 2: Right.  Not, I'm not surprised--no, not these--you know after you win the Pulitzer [Pulitzer Prize], you know everyone wants you to work with them.  So I'm not surprised these days.  I'm really pleased though when people really get what I do.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know what I mean?  And when people realize that yeah, I can write a good script.  I can figure out how to make a character viable, you know exciting you know.  I can tell a good story.  I can do all those things which is why I guess I keep getting hired to do things.  But they also understand that there is a current of something else.  When they hire Suzan-Lori Parks to write something, they'll get a good script.  They'll get a well made script you know that will attract actors and what not.  But they'll also get that other thing and I think that's what they're looking for when they call me up, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know they want the spirit.  They just don't want a product that they can sell, they want the spirit.  They want that bigger thing.  They want that song.  You know even though you can't--even though it's not out front in your face.  You know we're talking about god here, you know.  But they want that feeling, the feeling that you know like when we did, "Their Eyes Are Watching God" for Oprah [Oprah Winfrey].  And you know I mean I was just adapting Zora Neale Hurston's classic.  You know I was just adapting.  But when I went on the set when they were filming it, the actors came out of their trailers and came out off the set and the camera people and they just said thank you so much for creating this.  You know and I said--
Speaker 1: So they did, they got it!
Speaker 2: They got it!  I mean they knew I had adapted it and they were familiar with the--Zora Neale Hurston's work and all that.  They weren't saying you know that I made it up, but they said thank you for creating the film script so that we have something that we can all work from and bring this to--bring her work to a wider audience.  And thanks for making it possible.  They knew--they got, they totally got it.  And that's I think why people you know hire me cause--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean but who knows.
Speaker 1: So because they are actually getting it--
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: --as opposed to well she's a Pulitzer Prize winner so therefore--?
Speaker 2: Yeah they--yeah.  But anybody who reads "Topdog/Underdog" or who has seen it, you know they are, they're--you can't you know, they--or most people, I would say most people who read "Topdog/Underdog or plays like, my plays like "In the Blood" or they've seen "Their Eyes Were Watching God" or they read my novel, "Getting Mother's Body", they know that there's something else going on there.  I mean they really, they, you know they know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's surprises me that they you know--sometimes well I catch onto it but do they?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--well I don't know if they can articulate it.
Speaker 1: I guess they do.
Speaker 2: I don't know if they can articulate it but they do know that the spirit is present.  I just got a job writing something called "Cabrini Green", about a man named Brother Bill or Brother Bob.  I'm not quite sure of his name, I'm sorry.  He's based in Chicago [Illinois].  He's a white guy who back in the 80s [1980s] when Cabrini Green was very you know uhh-uhh (makes depressing sounds)--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --he heard the voice of god.  God told him, long story short, go out and create peace.  So this fellow went out into Cabrini Green and stood there until the bullets stopped flying.  He would do that day after day after day after day after day.  He's done it for years now that they're tearing Cabrini Green down.  But he did at one time help make peace there.  I got a call to work on this movie script.  I know you know they know why I know.  We all know that we're all doing the secret you know spiritual work you know.  So, you know--but anyway, but I could still you know tell a lot of like you know crazy you know off color jokes and you know we--the scripts are not like holy and pious, they're actually kind of raunchy and seductive and sexy.  But it's--yeah.
Speaker 1: But this message that you are, that you deliver, the presentation that you are delivering, the number of people and I guess that surprises me that I understand it.  But I don't think a lot of people will.  But what you are saying to me is a lot of people--
Speaker 2: Well they're getting it.  Well, I guess when I--with this new project, the "365 Days, 365 Plays", I wrote it as an offering.  The theater gave me so much that a couple of years ago I got the notion to write a play a day for a whole year.  And it was for fun, number one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Two, an offering to theater.  And I've just gone around the country, "Seven Cities in Seven Days."  We're running, it's running in fifteen cities for the whole year.  But I just opened the festival, "Seven Cities in Seven Days."  Everywhere I went, people totally got it.  The plays were fun, raunchy, wild, what have you.  The plays themselves, the people completely got it.  I had a group of Indian women from India who do not go to the theater come up after the show and stand around me and say thank you for making this beautiful offering.  It, you know people are getting it.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It's kind of exciting.
Speaker 1: Yes that is exciting.
Speaker 2: It's really exciting, yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: That is exciting.  I have not been but I will when I--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well you have the book now so you can just--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: You can just read them.
Speaker 1: Well I want to read it.  But I also want to go to the studio and sit down.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  And Woolly Mammoth [Woolly Mammoth Theatre, Washington, D.C.], I think I'm coming to the Woolly Mammoth, they're trying to get me to come in maybe January or something.  They're trying to get me to come out there for that.  And I love them over there so I'll try to make the time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I love--I enjoy (unclear) yes.
Speaker 2: And I'll tell you when cause maybe we can do more talking then.
Speaker 1: Okay, great.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Because I guess I'm excited because I discovered it, just over the past few days.  And when I was called and they said you know who Suzan-Lori Parks is and I said no.
Speaker 2: Well sure.
Speaker 1: But now I do and I'm getting more excited as I hear it.
Speaker 2: Oh thank you.  Thank you.  It's so cool because you know I had some--a couple of interviews for "365 Days, 365 Plays" and the people said well now you're asking theaters all over the country to perform you work for a year.  I mean don't you think it's kind of interesting that people would be performing like basically plays by a black woman every single day?  And I just thought how interesting?  How--they're--what are they afraid of?  What are they--I mean they haven't read the plays of course these people.  But what are they--there was such fear in that question.  I thought, I mean it was more about them.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It was all about them actually and it didn't have anything to do with me or my work.
Speaker 1: It's all about what they are used to being as opposed to what it is.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And we have to--
Speaker 1: It's (unclear) might say.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and we have to, they have to--well they have to encourage them to you know grow, you know.
Speaker 1: We've got a lot, long way to go.  That's the end of another reel.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: We must be having fun.
Speaker 2: Wow, this is great.  This is so great.  Wow, ooh, did she call?
