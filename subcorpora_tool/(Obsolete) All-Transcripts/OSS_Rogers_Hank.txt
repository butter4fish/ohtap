 Finchum Today is September 15, 2015. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with  Oklahoma State University, and today I am in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma  County, to interview Hank Rogers. This is part of our Cowboy in Every  County project. Thank you for having me today.  H. Rogers You   re welcome.  Finchum Let   s start with having you tell us when and where you were born.  H. Rogers I was born in Duncan, Oklahoma, on October the 9th, 1964, in Lindley  Hospital,  delivered by  Dr. Lindley. My parents were Cecil and Tomi  Rogers.  Finchum What did they do for a living?  H. Rogers My dad worked in the oilfield, and my mom, at that time, was a homemaker.  There were six kids. I was the youngest of the six, and in 1964, she was still  pretty much a homemaker. As time progressed, my dad began work in the  oilfield. By the late    60s, my dad bought an oilfield equipment rental  company, and by and large, that   s what I knew until he died in    97. I was  raised in the oilfield business. I was an oilfield brat and went to kindergarten  at a church in Duncan. I think it was the Presbyterian Church in Duncan.  Public school kindergarten was not available at that time, but I went from  first grade through the twelfth grade at Empire High School, which is a little  rural school west of Duncan, Oklahoma, in Stevens County and graduated in  1982 from Empire and said all along that I wasn   t going to school, wasn   t  going to college. I was going to work in the oilfield. For those that are of  any age at all knows what the industry was like in the    70s and the early     80s, it was wide open in the oilfield, and I was, I had worked a whole lot in  the oilfield, worked in the family business and very much had that as my  focus, period. That was my goal in life.  The summer after I graduated high school, my parents paid, I took a trip to  Europe, took a student council trip. I actually represented the state of  Oklahoma. Me and another guy went and toured Europe, and don   t even  remember the acronym. We went to school in Balliol College at Oxford  University that summer. Studied international relations, political science,  and debate, and we debated a bunch of British students several times, once a  week for, I think I was there, four weeks. Then we got to tour Europe. We  got to see NATO. We went to see SHAPE, which I had never even heard of  SHAPE. SHAPE is the Supreme Headquarters of Allied Powers Europe. It   s  basically the military arm of NATO. NATO   s the diplomats. SHAPE is the  military might of NATO, which was interesting.  Again, throughout that summer, I was not going to school. I was not going  to school. I was not, I didn   t want anything to do with college. I already had  two siblings that had graduated from OSU and one sibling that was present  at OSU at that time, but again, I didn   t need school. I   m not going to school.  I   m working in the oilfield. That   s it. I get back from Europe. It was two  weeks, two and a half weeks prior to the start of school. Of course I had  already sent the paperwork, at my mom   s request, to enroll and had already  been accepted and done all that stuff, but I   m not going. I   m not going. I   m  not going. I had been accepted, but I hadn   t enrolled. I enrolled in school the  week and a half before school started, and at that time, they had a program  called Petroleum Engineering Technology. I enrolled in that program, and I  got stuck in Stout Hall.  At that time, I looked at it as being stuck in Stout Hall, non-air-conditioned  building, which, moving up there mid-August, I began to realize,    Why in  the world did I wait until two weeks before school to enroll?    but it was  such a nice dorm, I stayed there the next four years. I requested it the next  three years. It was a great place to live in. The last year, I think it was either  the last year or my junior year, it actually went co-ed, which even made it  nicer. Anyway, I enrolled in Petroleum Engineering Technology. Graduated  in four years, on time, May of    86. Spring of    86, I met my, well, I didn   t  meet my wife. I met my wife a year earlier, but we got married. I was  married February of my senior year.  Finished school, and in    86, there wasn   t a whole lot of work in the oilfield.  That was not a good time to be graduating school. I think my graduating  class had nine. There was nine that graduated with the program. We started  when times were good, and we ended when times were not good. When I  got out of school, obviously we were living in Stillwater. We lived in  Stillwater for another year, almost to the day, after graduation. I worked  basically wherever I could, but for the most part, I worked for a roof truss  company in Cushing, Oklahoma, and I commuted back and forth making  roof trusses for homes and buildings.  May of    87, I had an opportunity to move back and work with the family  business. Probably could have always moved back and worked with the  family business, but times were really tough. I knew that my dad was, the  business was not doing real well, that it was a struggle, but there was a  death. There was a gentleman that died that worked for my dad that did that  work for him forever and ever and ever, and it gave me an opportunity to  backfill him. That   s how that transition took place.  My wife and two kids are in Duncan in May of    87, and I worked for him  June of    87, something like that. I worked for Dad, worked for our business  until November of    89 when my dad actually had an auction and sold out, at  which time, by that time, we already have the third son, and then in  December of    89, I went to work for my current employer, which is  Haliburton. Still in the oilfield. I just finished, last December, my twenty-fifth  anniversary with Haliburton. In    90, we had our fourth son and final  son. We ended up with four boys. We   ve raised four boys. Here   s my stint  for them. They   re all good, productive citizens in society. Three of them are  married. Three of them are fully employed and on their own. I have one still  in school, and he   s set to graduate in a year. We   re doing very good. Let   s  see.  Finchum Did any of them go to OSU, your sons?  H. Rogers One did. My second son, Jordan, the one that nominated me, he left high  school. Went to school for a little bit. Didn   t work real well, but he ended up  going to the Navy. He came back from the Navy grown up. He then went  back to school. He actually just graduated this last May. He   s a graduate,  and he   s fully employed and doing very well also. Our house was divided.  We had four boys. My wife and her family are all Sooner fans. Me and all of  my family are Cowboy fans. Then it   s amazing how the split in a household  happens, but we have two boys that are Sooners and two boys that are  Cowboys. (Laughter) It   s just right down the middle. The one that   s actually  still in school is not going to OSU, but he is a Cowboy.  Finchum (Laughs) Is he going to the other school?  H. Rogers No, he   s not going to the other school. He   s going to UCO  University of  Central Oklahoma  here in the city. (Laughter) He stayed a little closer to  home so he could work and, anyway, just chose a different path.  Finchum Do you want to tell us the name of your dad   s company?  H. Rogers Duncan Rental   Supply. Duncan Rental   Supply. Cecil Rogers was his  name. He   d been in the oilfield business in southern Oklahoma for many  years. We basically operated in Oklahoma, Texas, southern Kansas, New  Mexico, and Arkansas, and we had a broad reach. He actually didn   t start  the company. The Duncan Rental   Supply was actually started back in the     40s by a gentleman by the name of O.P. Jones, and Dad bought it from O.P.  Jones. They had property side by side out in the country. That   s how they  came, they knew each other, and then Dad bought O.P.   s, I don   t know what  the O.P. stood for. It was always O.P. Jones, and it was O.P. this and O.P.  that. O.P. Jones, he bought it. It was already an established business. It  really gave Dad a good opportunity to jump in and continue to grow,  especially in the    70s, the way the oilfield market was. It was a great time to  be in the oil business.  Finchum Well, was he from Duncan himself?  H. Rogers He was born and raised in Duncan, Oklahoma. He went to high school at  Empire High School, as I did. He graduated in 1944 from Empire High  School. He had a neat story, of course with what was going on in the early     40s in the world. My dad did not serve in the military. Sometimes people  look at that as a negative thing, but Dad, he actually had gotten his draft card  from the Army in, I don   t know,    43. It was his junior, senior year. He had  got his draft card, but he said,    Well, if I   m going to go, I   m going to go be  in the Air Force,    which was very young at that time.  He went and volunteered for the Air Force. It wasn   t called the Air Force  then. It was called something else. I don   t remember what, but he went and  tried out. He flunked the physical. He had a bum knee from a basketball  injury or something. He flunked the physical, couldn   t serve, and then he,  two weeks later, he showed up at his, the actual date that he was called to go  in the Army. When they found out that he had flunked the physical over  there, they sent him on his way and said,    Go home.    He actually didn   t  serve.  My mom is from Trinity, Texas, down northeast of Houston. Her last name  or maiden name was Roach. She was a cockroach. (Laughter) Tomigene  Roach. She didn   t have a middle name. It was just Tomigene Roach. That  was Mom and Dad, and Mom died in 2002. Dad died in    97.  Finchum There were six children?  H. Rogers Six kids. The oldest is Rick. He graduated from OSU. Actually, he got a  master   s from OSU in animal science, I believe, and then never used that  degree. He worked in the oilfield his whole life. (Laughs) Kind of a neat  story, and then I had a sister that graduated in education from OSU. Then  she subsequently got her master   s and doctorate at some other universities,  and then I have, the third sibling that went there, she went also in education  and ended up graduating and transferring to another school up in Missouri to  actually graduate. There was four of us in total that went to OSU, three of us  that graduated in my family, siblings.  Finchum Well, back in high school, did you have a favorite subject?  H. Rogers I have extremely fond memories of high school. If I had to say a favorite  subject, it would be math-related. I had some great teachers and just enjoyed  it, and I was real good at it. It was small classes, as you would expect. I  mean, literally, I had, in my senior year, my math class was me and the  teacher in his office. He was the counselor, and it was just me and him. I  couldn   t complain. They were very good to me. I was the student council  president my junior and senior year, and they actually gave me an hour a  day to take care of all the vending machines on campus and stuff like that. I  handled the money, and I ordered the candy. I filled the pop machines. It  was pretty much a gravy job. I didn   t do a work study at that time because it  was, the first hour of the day was the, I chose it. It was by my choice, the  way my schedule worked out, but I took care of student council stuff. It was  basically an hour of Hank Rogers    student council activities. They don   t do  that anymore, I don   t think, but I got to do it.  Finchum Well, did you play sports?  H. Rogers I did not play sports. I mean, I played sports in the seventh grade. When I  moved into junior high, I played basketball one year, and it didn   t, I didn   t  need anybody to tell me I wasn   t physically adept to that. (Laughs) I didn   t  pursue that, but I was in band the whole time. I joined band in the fourth  grade and went all the way through the twelfth grade. I was at all the  activities. I just wasn   t on the field. I was making the noise in the stands.  Finchum What instrument did you play?  H. Rogers Well, I started out on the baritone, brass, brass baritone, and then when I got  into junior high, we started transitioning into jazz. Our band director was a  bass player, Jay Brannage. He was a wonderful individual, but he was  a   oh, how do you say it? He   d go play at the bars and stuff. He was into  that, the five or six people, the jazz band-type stuff. Stage band is what we  started, he started driving to. As the group started growing in skills, he found  it better to   Empire couldn   t compete with Duncan and Comanche   Oklahoma  and other schools that could put seventy, eighty, a hundred kids  on the field. We couldn   t compete with them in marching, concert-type  stuff, but if you   re only putting a dozen kids on a stage, as small as Empire  was, it   d have twenty-five, thirty people coming out for band. Not all of the  thirty were very good. He could put ten, twelve, thirteen, fourteen together  in stage band, in jazz band, and we could compete very well. That   s what we  did. That was what we did. We were a jazz band. When that happened, I  transitioned from a baritone to a trombone, and I still have all my trombones  from back then.  Finchum Probably had more fun than a marching band.  H. Rogers Well, it was. There was a whole lot less competition. You stood out, and we  actually toured around all over southern Oklahoma. Went to schools to do  exchange programs, and we would go in and do a concert for these schools.  We went to Duncan. We went to Comanche. We went to Walters   Oklahoma , which was just a bunch of rural schools around, and it was a  big thing because back then, nobody played. There wasn   t jazz bands in  every school. It was a huge thing.  Finchum Have to play for dances?  H. Rogers No, we never played for a dance because at that time, that was, that kind of  goes back to the history of rural America. Empire didn   t have dances until  actually my, was it my senior year or my junior year? Anyway, it was, that  was   .  Finchum They weren   t allowed?  H. Rogers Exactly, yeah. Anyway, but we did, we played for some city, some stuff at  the country club. It was actually OETA, Oklahoma Teachers Education  Association. They would put on, have meetings at the country club there in  Duncan, and we   d play for them and stuff like that. It was fun.  Finchum Did you belong to FFA or 4-H?  H. Rogers I was in 4-H when I was real little, but other than a few science projects, I  don   t have any, I was not active in that in high school. My focus in high  school, much to some people   s dismay, was, when I was younger, was  basically band, band, band, band, band, and then as I got older, it was band  and work, band and work, band and work, band and work. That was pretty  much it. Even in high school, soon as I turned sixteen, I started driving, and  again, what was going on in the oilfield in the late    70s. Our products, we  would deliver stuff. I would literally leave school, go hop in a truck, and I   d  drive to west Texas, drive to southern Kansas. I   d get back at three o   clock  in the morning, and I   d shower and go to sleep, get up and go to school the  next day. That was my life, and I loved it. That was my adrenaline rush.  Everybody else was going up and down the strip in Duncan, Oklahoma, and  I   m waving at them in a truck headed to Elk City  Oklahoma . (Laughs)  Who knows? I was a geek.  Finchum When would you do your homework if you   re on the road that much?  H. Rogers That   s kind of a sad thing is that when I was in high school there wasn   t a  whole lot of homework because it wasn   t near as challenging as   in  hindsight, I wished it had been and what I would have wished on my kids  and what we forced on my kids when they were growing up. We wanted it  to be more of a challenge. High school was not work. It was a great time to,  I mean, at least for me, it was a really good time.  Finchum Would you get paid when you made these trips?  H. Rogers Oh yeah, Dad paid me. I don   t know that it was maybe an equitable trade for  the hours invested, but yes, yes, I got paid. Dad paid me, and I had money. I  could do stuff, and when it came time to   I didn   t buy a car when I turned  sixteen, but later in my junior year, I found a car. I bought a car, and I had  money to spend on it. I still have the car today, believe it or not. (Laughs)  Terri Rogers Well, tell them what it was   H. Rogers Well, it was a    68 Dodge Charger, and I made it a General Lee.  Finchum Is it orange?  H. Rogers It   s orange with an 01 on the side, flag on the top, which is not exactly  politically correct these days.  Finchum True.  H. Rogers Terri   s telling me how long I can keep it like that. (Laughs) Yeah, yeah, I  had the role bar, the push bar, and everything.  Finchum It still runs?  H. Rogers The motor will run, but the transmission   s out on it. Right now, it   s sitting in  a building up on blocks just waiting until I have time to mess with it and  resurrect it     Finchum    or until one of the boys takes an interest in it, too?  H. Rogers Exactly, exactly, until they decide that enough is enough. (Laughter)  Finchum Well, did you have a bank account back in the, when you were fourteen,  fifteen, sixteen?  H. Rogers Oh yeah, yeah. Mom and Dad gave us bank accounts. I couldn   t even tell  you how young I was. I was probably in the single digits. Mom and Dad,  they opened up accounts for all of us, and I mean, back then, it was just  probably, I mean, I don   t remember. I remember the little bitty, I probably  still have, I think I still have the little bank book, little bitty bank ledger  book that you flip through and you do your deposits and withdrawals. Yeah,  I still have it, and they deposited money. They would deposit money that we  didn   t even know about because you just look at it. You get a bank   of  course, not that I would ever get a bank statement, but by the time I got old  enough to see a bank statement, I could see the history of all these deposits  which I obviously had not put in there. My parents were very good to me. I  have absolutely nothing to complain about.  Finchum Did they help with tuition?  H. Rogers They helped with tuition until I got married, which, lucky for us, we didn   t  get married until our senior year. (Laughs) It was all taken care of. When I  started at OSU, tuition was five, less than six dollars an hour, and when I  graduated, it was thirteen dollars an hour. I thought it was a, they were about  to kill me.  Finchum Now how much is it? (Laughs)  H. Rogers Probably a hundred and forty or something. (Laughs)  Finchum A lot more than that. I think it   s over three hundred.  H. Rogers Really? Okay.  Finchum I think.  H. Rogers I think the tuition has obviously way outpaced cost of living and things like  that, but no, my parents, again, they were very supportive of me. They  wanted me to go to college the whole time. Mom and Dad were just twisting  my arm. I was the one that was rebelling, saying,    No, I don   t need to do  that. I don   t need that sheet of paper. I   m going to go to work in the oilfield.  I   m going to work with you.     Finchum When you finally went, what did they say?  H. Rogers I don   t even really remember.  Finchum Not    I told you so   ? (Laughs)  H. Rogers Other than,    I knew you would.    I don   t really remember the actual reaction  of,    Okay, I   m going.    I don   t remember their response.  Finchum Did they take you up and drop you off?  H. Rogers Well, fortunately I had a sibling there that was one year ahead of me. We  had a car. I was in high cotton with that, whereas my oldest brother, Rick,  he   s the one that literally got dropped off, and they drove off. (Laughs)  Again, times have changed. The times from the mid-   60s to the late    70s  was a huge difference, but no, we had an automobile the entire time.  Finchum What did you take with you? Do you remember? One or two suitcases and a  TV, or what?  H. Rogers I don   t remember if I had a TV or not. No, I don   t remember the details of  that. I remember going up and down the stairs of Stout Hall. I remember  how hot it was and how at every turn I was complaining about why all my  friends that I graduated from high school with were up in Kerr or in  Willham or in, I guess it was Scott, Scott-Parker-Wentz. Well, one of those  was a girls, and two was   .  T. Rogers Scott-Parker was boys.  H. Rogers Scott-Parker, okay. They were up there, and again, the whole air  conditioning thing was huge. I had missed it because I   d waited, but the flip  side was the Stout Hall rooms were significantly larger than everybody else.  They had a sink in the room. That   s huge. (Laughter) I mean, the sink in the  room was, it came to be very huge, and I had a roommate for two years.  Then I had a private room for my junior year until I turned it in in my senior  year, which was outstanding.  Finchum What floor, and what room number? Do you remember?  H. Rogers I was in 413 for the first two years, and then I was in 421 the last two years.  Finchum You didn   t even change floors.  H. Rogers No, I didn   t. No, it was great. It was great, and again, the people were the  same. There   s half the people that were there that hated it, couldn   t get past  the old building and the fact that the lunch room   s not in Stout. We had to  go over to   Stout, what was the sister dorm? We had to walk to eat lunch. It  was south of the registrar   s office, whatever that building is.  T. Rogers South of Whitehurst?  Finchum Well, Willard   s there.  H. Rogers Willard  Willard. It was Willard that   .  Finchum It was a women   s dorm.  H. Rogers Okay, that was where we, that was our sister dorm where we had to go eat.  That   s where we ate our meals was in Willard Hall, but again, half the  people didn   t like it. Half the people did and stayed, and all of a sudden, the  second year or the third, I mean, just like me, we got, me and my roommate  got stuck there our freshman year. We stayed there our sophomore year, and  then Randy Redding, my roommate, he moved out and roomed with another  guy junior and senior year. That   s when I got a private room, and it was at  the end of the hallway on a corner. There was no traffic. You could leave  your door open, and it was awesome.  Finchum The phone was down the hall or in the room?  H. Rogers No, we actually had a phone in the room. The phones in the hall, I don   t  remember one being in the hall. It was down on the first   there were phones  you could use, but they weren   t on the floor. Yeah, we had a phone in our  room all four years.  Finchum Would you call home often?  H. Rogers Oh, I   m sure I did in the beginning, but you got to keep in mind   remember  my work ethic from high school was band and work, band and work. Well,  even in college, it was the exact same thing. I had one semester that I  arranged all my classes on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Everything,  my entire class was Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Well, I would go  home Thursday night, work Friday and Saturday, Sunday and Monday,  come back Monday night, and go to school on Tuesday. I had lots of where I  wouldn   t have any class on Friday or I wouldn   t have any class   I mean, I  didn   t try to get class empty in the middle of the week. It was always  Monday or Friday. I was trying to get it off because I would work and head  home.  Finchum By choice.  H. Rogers By choice, yeah. I mean, again, yeah, it was by choice. I   m a very good  example of if you enjoy what you do, if you enjoy what you put your hands  to do, you   ll never work a day in your life. I enjoy the satisfaction of  accomplishment. Accomplishment has satisfaction or has rewards, and I like  doing stuff. I   m a doer to a great extent.  Finchum Well, if your room wasn   t air-conditioned, did you go to study in the library  or the Student Union?  H. Rogers Only when I was needing stuff from the library. By and large, you just learn  to live with it. On the fourth floor of Stout Hall, it has the big dormers  coming out, if you remember the building. Well, those were all little, people  would generally put their twin bed in that dormer. Well, I would have my  twin bed in there, but there   d be a fan at the end of there with the window  open. Lots of box fans.  I actually had a couch with a hide-a-bed in my room, believe it or not, that a  guy gave me, but no, the heat was rough. People don   t appreciate   that  actually brings up an interesting point. You don   t appreciate the simple thing  of doing your homework in this, you have to constantly wipe your arm  because of the sweat off your arm is getting all over your paper, that simple  thing of   we couldn   t work like that today, and I   m not that old. A lot of  people had it a whole lot worse than what I had it, as if a non-air-conditioned  building was rough.  Again, I got stuck there and chose it by choice the next three years. At least I  didn   t think it was unbearable. My kids would have, they would have  thrown a shoe (laughs) and would have revolted had I asked them to stay in  a non-air-conditioned dorm. (Laughter)  Finchum Well, if you were coming home on the weekends and you were studying so  hard those three days that you were there, what would you do for fun?  H. Rogers Well, I was very active in church, and by and large, other than the guys on  the floor in the dorm, we obviously did intramurals. The intramurals that I  participated in, by and large, was softball, and then I refereed softball a  couple of years with intramurals, and racquetball. That   s probably the only  two activities that I participated in, as far as on campus, with the guys in the  dorm. But outside of school, I was very active in, got involved very much so  with the church in Stillwater. My sister had already been there a year ahead.  I didn   t have to go break the ice myself. I kind of got led into it, and that was  life changing. That   s where I met my wife, at the church. It was outstanding.  Finchum You mentioned you were in band in high school.  H. Rogers Yup, I was in band in high school, and then I actually served in the OSU  marching band one year, my junior year. I think it was my junior year. Was  it my junior year or my sophomore year?  T. Rogers I don   t know.  H. Rogers I don   t remember  I think it was my junior year. I think it was my third year.  T. Rogers What year was the Gator Bowl?  H. Rogers Yeah, it was the year we went to the Gator Bowl, whatever year that was,  with Pat Jones. I played trombone for the marching band. That was a blast.  A lot of hot practices out on the Lewis Field, but that, again, that was good  memories. I remember when it came time to go to the OU game. Of course I  got to go because I was in the band, but as a student, I could have two  tickets. At that time, they didn   t have a lottery or anything. You had to go  wait in line, and it was basically first come, first serve, long as the tickets  lasted. I remember camping out there outside of Gallagher-Iba. Camping  started at seven or eight o   clock the night before in freezing temperatures  because it was cold, and I got my two tickets and gave them to a friend at  church so he could go to the game with his girlfriend.  Finchum Camping out with tents?  H. Rogers Yep, yep, yep, we had tents, and he, Joey, brought us hot chocolate and  dinner and stuff like that while we were out there waiting in line, yeah. I  think that   s the only time I   ve ever done anything like that. That was fun.  Again, it   s the whole comradery of the people all around you, and  everybody   s doing the exact same thing. Everybody   s there for the exact  same reason, suffering through the exact same weather conditions, and  everybody   s uncomfortable and stuff like that. That was fun.  Finchum Did you have another favorite spot on campus, even today, that you like to  go back to?  H. Rogers Well, Theta Pond, I mean, how could you, I mean, back then, it   yeah, I  mean, again, I   m a country boy. I loved OSU campus in general, but we  would go pitch rocks on Theta Pond. It   s changed a lot since I was there or  at least the last time that we were there. There   s lots of changes that   s  happened on campus, but yeah, that. Then obviously the grounds in front of  Edmon Low Library, that   s, you   d go out and sit, but again, I didn   t spend a  whole lot of time sitting. For me, sitting was waiting from between one class  and the next, and I was too lazy to go back to the room. (Laughs) You sit  down and do a little homework right then and there.  T. Rogers The Student Union.  H. Rogers I   ll never forget one time. I was in the Student Union, and again, the Student  Union then and now is not the same thing. I had eaten or had gotten a snack,  and just one story that I   ve actually told over and over and over again in my  career was a guy walked up and said,    Can I sit down?    Of course, he   s an  adult. He wasn   t a student. It was obvious right off the bat, and turns out he  was there interviewing, for interviews.    Oh, okay. Well, what are you  doing? Blah, blah, blah,    and he   s asking me all these questions. Of course, I  wasn   t a senior, wasn   t ready to graduate when he was asking me all these  questions. I tell him what degree I   ve got and what my background is and  everything.  He said,    Yeah, we can use people like that,    and then he tells me he was  from the CIA.    I   m here interviewing for the U.S. government, for the  CIA.       What in the world does the CIA need a petroleum graduate for?     Well, then he went into all of the justification. It was a really neat, it was  really neat, eye-opening as to the   you think that your degree is so   you  have your own idea of where you   re going to go to school or what you   re  going to do, but sometimes the path once you get out the door is   again, get  the sheet of paper, and then you can do anything. You can do anything you  want to do. Just get that sheet of paper.  Finchum Well, who would do your laundry?  H. Rogers I did my own laundry. Now the first, probably the first year, I would bring it  home with me, and Mom would obviously do it. Not too long after that,  again, it became easier to do the laundry there than it was to pack it and  carry it and do all that. Again, I   m always looking to simplify things and  eliminate work, you could say. Improve efficiency might be a better way to  say it. I decided that carrying big laundry baskets up and down flights of  stairs and elevators and carrying it out, way out into the parking lot was a  whole lot more work than just doing the laundry yourself. Go down the  elevator, step off to the right, and there   s the washing machines. It wasn   t  very long into my college career that I did my own laundry and did it for  forever.  Finchum Self-sufficient?  H. Rogers Yeah, well, or lazy, depending on how you look at it. (Laughter)  Finchum Well, did the Student Union have the bowling alley in it when you were  there?  H. Rogers Yes, they did. Yes, they did. They had the bowling alley, and they had the,  they used to show movies in there as well. We did use the bowling alley.  The bowling alley   s probably the one thing that, even within the, I   d bring  kids from church. We   d go to the bowling alley and play. Yep.  Finchum Some wish it was back.  H. Rogers Yeah  (Laughter)  Finchum They have changed that building quite a bit.  H. Rogers Oh, I don   t even know my way around there. I mean, we were up there just  this last, well, last football season, and we constantly go in there. It seems  like it changes every time I go there, which is good. The changes are good.  It   s a very, it   s a lot nicer facility than it was, by and large, when I was there,  but a lot more spacious, for sure.  Finchum How often do you get back?  H. Rogers Not as often as I wished. I mean, we went up there when our kids were  doing college tours, and then we   ve been there for probably one football  game a year. Not great, but once a year we   ll go back up. We keep saying  we   re going to go back up and go up there on an off-football weekend and  just walk around because we   re always just clock, clock, clock. We got to  go. We got to go. We want to see all this, but we don   t have near enough  time to see it.  Of course my wife worked on campus for six years. She has great memories  of the campus as well, and when we go back and visit, we don   t go to all the  new places, other than the Student Union. It   s obviously remodeled, but it   s  still the Student Union. We go to the older buildings and go down memory  lane of the old Arts and Science, the old Engineering Building, the old  Cordell Hall, which is, turned into a technology building and stuff like that. I  actually have spent more time in our trips back going to the old buildings  that, I mean, there   s some of the new buildings I have, that have been there  for years and years and years, and I   ve never even walked in them, never  broke the door just because so short on time. I don   t have any memories that  take me in there. They always take me to the old stuff,    ah, I remember this  class, I remember these stairs,    stuff like that.  Finchum Was the Classroom Building there?  H. Rogers Yep, the Classroom Building was there just north of the Student Union.  Finchum Was Noble Research Center, or was it, it came after?  H. Rogers No, no, no, that came, that was, the Noble Research Center, that was the old  International Plaza. That went all the way up, that whole area went   didn   t  go all the way   what was the road north of the football field?  T. Rogers McElroy? No.  Finchum Well, Washington stops at the campus and then picks up again, but McElroy  does. There   s Hall of Fame.  T. Rogers McElroy?  Farm Road?   H. Rogers Anyway, that, between the, there was the Engineering Building, and then  there was, there was two buildings that run north and south. This was the  Engineering Building, and the one on the east was an engineering building.  The one on the west was, that   s where I took electrical classes, physics  building or something like that, and that whole center area was where all the  flags  were , which is the south side of the Noble building now.  Finchum North of the library.  H. Rogers Exactly, exactly. Yeah, you come right out of the north end of the library,  and you were in the old International Hall or International Plaza, whatever it  was called.  Finchum I figured, with petroleum, if it had been there, you would have had  classes   .  H. Rogers Exactly. It didn   t come until, I don   t even remember if they were breaking  ground. Again, the mid-   80s, they weren   t spending a lot of money in  petroleum.  Finchum That   s when the banking and the oil and all that changed, wasn   t it?  H. Rogers Exactly.  Finchum I don   t remember my history too well, but I remember those.  H. Rogers Yep, yep, that   s correct, yeah. Yeah, the Penn Square Bank right over here,  not too far from here was, I think, the first major domino that fell in the  early    80s that precipitated into lots of bad days in the banking business.  Finchum For graduation day, did your parents come up?  H. Rogers Yes, they did. Yes, they did, and it was in the Gallagher-Iba. Honestly, I  couldn   t tell you who the speaker was. (Laughs) I remember the building. I  remember standing there taking pictures because I guess that   s the one thing  you have. You remember the photograph, but man, I don   t   my class was  so small. I have no contact with people that I, I mean, I couldn   t even, I   d  have to go back in an annual to try to find them. By that time, I was focused  on family and then still involved in the church a lot. My relationship with  fellow students was actually second or third tier in my sphere of influence,  so to speak.  Finchum Well, your roommate that you had for two years, do you stay in touch with  him?  H. Rogers Randy, Randy, yeah, yeah, we correspond every now and then. (Laughs) He  went into accounting. We kind of divested. He graduated from OSU, went to  work with one of the big, huge, accounting firms, got his CPA license, and  then he actually married a girl from Latin America whose parents were very  affluent in that country, whatever the country was. I believe he still manages  their estate or their assets in the U.S., he   s doing very well.  Finchum Once you graduated from OSU, you had a couple of jobs, and then you  ended up at Halliburton?  H. Rogers Yep, I ended up at Halliburton in    89, December of    89. Been there ever  since.  Finchum Doing what?  H. Rogers I   ve been in technology the whole time. I have actually done the exact,  virtually the same job. When I first started, I started out swinging a  sledgehammer, working on a place that the technology group calls    skid  row,    which is skid row not because it   s bad but because it   s a mobile  facility where they move stuff in and out to do different types of testing.  Everything   s on skids. You move skids, portable units, all over the place. I  did that for just nearly six months.  My in to Halliburton was, remember our family business was equipment,  rental oilfield equipment? Well, we rented a lot of equipment to the testing  group at Halliburton, which was at skid row, and it   d test well and stuff like  that. I knew those people, and when my dad was selling out, again, we were  a small family business. Feast or famine. You make money this week. You  may not make money next week. It was very cyclical. My wife couldn   t  handle that. She just couldn   t handle the feast or famine mentality of being  self-employed. She actually went and got the application for Halliburton,  and I filled it out. They hired me.  I went to work for Halliburton Technology, the old Mechanical Research  and Development group at the lab. I worked there for six months, and then I  moved over in May of    90 to the technology center there in Duncan in a  group called Tools, Research, and Engineering, TRE. I got put into a  downhole cementing tools group called Casing Equipment then, and that   s  still the group I work for today.  Now I   m senior global adviser for the group, and I   ve held nearly every  position in the group over the last twenty-five years. I   ve been a part of the  development of technology for Halliburton ever since. It   s just been a  wonderful, wonderful, for me, a wonderful career. I had opportunities.  Again, my mindset when I was growing up was I was going to work in our  place of business over there on the east side of town, and going to work for  Halliburton   Halliburton was born in Duncan. Essentially, it was  incorporated in Duncan. Its entire history is tied to Duncan, but you go to  work for a technology group.  I had no idea the influence that the name Halliburton had to our venders. If  you have an idea as a little, independent company, it   s hard to get people to  support your idea and to find people to fund it and suppliers to give you  products. Well, with Halliburton, I found myself in a position if I went to a  vender and asked for something, well, all of a sudden they would throw  resources at you. They would do things. They would take you. You would  ask them a question, and they   d go do three more things to try to get you an  answer. You had access to lots of capabilities, and that was very eye-opening  to me. After a few years, in    96, I got my professional registration.  I   m a registered professional engineer in the state of Oklahoma. Again,  being a part of technology development, it   s neat to design something that  you see used all over the world.  Finchum Do some patents then?  H. Rogers Yeah, I got to do a lot of patents. I actually have sixty-one patents. I have  sixty-one patents. I   ve written something in the mid-to-low-fifties of papers.  I   ve written lots of papers, traveled the world, been to low-fifties countries,  fifty-something countries around the world, fifty-two, and again, that   s kind  of where I was headed to. I was only thinking in terms of, before I went to  Halliburton, going to our business on the east side of Duncan, and now  Halliburton, again, Halliburton has been wonderful to me. They   ve shown  me how big the world is.  This world   s a whole lot bigger than Duncan, Oklahoma. It   s a lot bigger  than Oklahoma. It   s a lot bigger than the United States, much to the chagrin  of lots of people. The world is a big place, and traveling to the Caribbean on  a vacation, on a cruise is not international traveling. (Laughter) Again, I  have multi-entry visas for Saudi Arabia, Angola, Australia, and Brazil and  can come and go at will to those, and that   s just those four countries. Then  there   s lots of countries that you can travel to with an American passport  anyway.  Finchum Speak other languages?  H. Rogers I wish I could. I wish I could. I can   t speak any other language other than  English, and I don   t know that I speak English very well. The good thing  about the oilfield is that the oilfield almost completely is influenced by the  West, not just the United States but the United States and Europe, the UK.  Lots of national oil companies around the world were founded by American  oil companies or British oil companies, and English rules the oilfield, by and  large. You can go and communicate. Now to and from the hotel and  restaurants and things like that can be a challenge sometimes, but when  you   re at work, by and large, English rules.  Finchum That makes sense.  H. Rogers Kind of like in the aviation industry. I mean, if you   re going to be a pilot and  fly international across borders, you have to be able to speak English  because all air traffic control globally, at least as far as international  transportation, is done in English. API is the American Petroleum Institute.  That   s kind of an industry regulatory body that creates document standards  and practices for the oil industry, all aspects of the oil industry. I   ve served  on the API Committee Ten, SC 10, which is Standing Committee Ten for oil  wells cements since 2002. I   ve done that. Been a part of writing of standards  for the oil industry used in my little world, my little piece of the pie, so to  speak. Again, it   s been very fun.  Back in the    90s at Halliburton in Duncan, I had the opportunity, I had  several opportunities to move and to go to other groups and do other things,  and because I am so resistant to change, number one, it kept me doing the  same thing. Number two, I thoroughly enjoyed what I did. I just was like,     Man, this is so fun. I   m having so much fun. Why would I do something  else? I like these people,    but at the end of the day, I chose (this is kind of  the way I   ve explained it), I chose early on to be the person that writes the  books than the guy that reads the books. Within my little hole of the world,  that   s what I chose to do. I chose to be the guy that writes the books, the guy  that people go to when something   s not clear.  Finchum Well, how did you get from Duncan to Oklahoma City?  H. Rogers In 2012, my group began a transition from Duncan, Oklahoma, to Houston.  As with a lot of Halliburton   s research and technology, they built the new  technology center in Houston, and they were systematically moving pieces  of it to Houston. My group was slated to move in 2012 (or was it 2011?),  and at that time, our first grandbaby was announced. I   m travelling a whole  lot. I spend, historically, somewhere between a quarter and a third, not much  more than a third of my time gone. My wife says half the time, that I spent a  lot of time gone.  In Duncan, we had country property, several acres, high maintenance. Kids  are all gone. Hank   s gone. My wife   s kind of ADD as it comes to how  things look. She began bearing the brunt of our property, and all, the perfect  storm developed that she   s doing all the work. My group   s moving.  Grandbaby   s coming. We need to be closer to the kids. We have two kids in  the Oklahoma City area, two kids in Tulsa, and the grandbaby who   s going  to be in Tulsa. We chose to move north after being in Duncan essentially my  whole life, except for when I went to school plus a year. We chose to move  north to get closer to the kids so she would be able to be closer to them  when I   m gone.  Originally, I moved to Tuttle, Oklahoma, which gave us basically enough I  could commute and still work at Duncan, but as the transition drew to a  close in Duncan, Halliburton was gracious enough to allow me to work  remote. I actually work at the sales office downtown Oklahoma City, but I  still have my group. My technology group   s in Houston, and my manager   s  in Houston. All of my work is associated with Houston. At that time, I  became an offsite employee, basically.  Finchum Racking up frequent flyer points. (Laughs)  H. Rogers Yeah, yeah, I have, yeah, I have. I   ve been blessed with lots of frequent  flyer miles.  Finchum Do you have to go out to the big rigs out in the ocean?  H. Rogers Yep  I actually just got back from Norway just, on August 12th, and I spent  almost two weeks offshore Norway. When I go to the field, my wife doesn   t  like me to say it this way, but people ask me what I do for a living. I say I  sell confidence in myself, my people, and my equipment. Sometimes that  entails just office visits. Sometimes this entails convincing my own  employees, my own Halliburton coworkers to    Trust me. This will work,     because nobody wants to use a tool the first time, but remember, I   m in the  technology business. That   s all I do is make new things, make new  processes, procedures.  Well, sometimes, I mean, it   s relationships. You have to convince somebody  that what I   m bringing to your location will work because this may be a  hundred-million-dollar well, and I   m asking you to do something that   s  never been done anywhere in the entire world. You are first. A lot of that is  made possible through relationships and just,    Okay. I   ll be there. I will be  there when this happens,    and that   s exactly what happened in Norway. I  mean, it   s a tool that we deployed globally in 2012, but in Norway, they had  never used it before. It was a huge process to get it approved from a  regulatory perspective, and once we got approval,    Let   s go, Hank.    I went  to the job, and everything went well. It was a good job.  Finchum Does it always go well?  H. Rogers Well, no, it has not always gone well. Sometimes things happen. Obviously,  every time we go to jobs, safety is number one. We don   t want anybody to  get hurt. We want everybody to go home. We want to protect the  environment. This is a Halliburton commercial here. We want to protect the  environment, number two, and then number three, we want to protect the  customer   s or the client   s investment. Sometimes the investment is at stake.  Something we say is going to take six hours takes twelve hours. Well, that  extra six hours is very expensive. Sometimes things don   t go perfect, but  have I ever been a part of a job, personally, where we totally strapped and  bad things happened and we had to move the rig and go do something else?  No, that   s never happened. Part of that is just good people, good planning,  and good execution.  Finchum Some of these things that you   re applying today, can you track them back to  your OSU education?  H. Rogers Well, I mean, the fundamentals, absolutely. I mean, for me, I got a, my  degree was petroleum engineering technology, which is fundamentally very  much like a petroleum engineering degree, but it   s more focused on the  technical side, the hands-on, the application of the technology or of the  engineering. It all comes back to fundamentals. Know your math.  Understand forces. Understand free-body diagrams. I do it constantly. I try  to get people to stop looking at this picture, and let   s look at this picture, a  free-body diagram from a math class, from a physics class, from a dynamics  class. You start. You eliminate all the noise, and let   s just talk about what   s  happening right here. That   s a part of the fundamentals.  I said earlier,    Get the sheet of paper and you can go do anything.    I mean, I  work with some people that have physics education degrees, but yet they   re  in my field doing work. It   s because they know the fundamentals. By and  large, most businesses are going to teach you what they want you to do.  They   re going to teach you how to do what they want you to do. You just  need to bring the skillsets that prove that you   re trainable and that you can  be educated to do things in a structured, regimented, process-oriented  manner.  I mean, my degree was petroleum engineering technology. It was all focused  on the oilfield. Virtually, other than the, what we would now call core  curriculum, all of my classes were taught by people that were familiar with  the oilfield, and I was raised in the oilfield. For me, the OSU experience was  just the culmination of my life at that time. I   ve been raised in the oilfield.  I   d been to well sites all over southcentral United States and had spent lots  of time in these places, but I didn   t have the understanding of what was  actually going on. I was bringing the two-by-four to the house, but I really  didn   t know why you used a two-by-four instead of a two-by-six.  The OSU education helped teach me why you do one thing over another and  why you do it in this order. Again, it comes back to foundation. It comes  back to just laying the brick in education from the perspective of teaching  the student what he needs to know to be successful. It   s not a guarantee that  he   s going to be successful, but it   s providing the building blocks that you  can, when you walk out the door, you have the skillsets to take the next step.  I hope that   s a reasonable answer.  Finchum That   s good. (Laughter) You thanked your mother for making you apply.  (Laughs)  H. Rogers Absolutely, absolutely. I mean, the two things. Number one, Mom making  me or twisting my arm or shaming me into going to school, my wife  shaming me into going to work for Halliburton. That   s probably the two  women that   s most influential in my life that has got me to where I   m at  today. Again, I   m much better equipped to be an independent business  owner now than I would have been thirty years ago, but I wouldn   t trade it. I  mean, I   ve had a great career. I mean, I   ve had a great, great career, and it   s  so much a success as it is dependent upon the individual.  You have to capitalize on the circumstances that you   re in, and I thank every  day the work ethic that my dad gave me. My dad wasn   t a golfer. He wasn   t  a fisherman. He wasn   t a hunter, and neither am I. I found out and have  learned how to enjoy what I   m doing, and I think tremendously that has  made, that   s what   s contributed to my success not only in high school, but in  college and in the workforce.  Finchum Have you figured out how to translate that into the same lesson for your  children?  H. Rogers Well, my kids, I think they think I   m a whole lot smarter now than I was at  maybe seven or eight, ten years ago. Honestly, I   m going to say the answer  is yes to that question, but in the last ten years, I mean, our oldest is, what,  thirty-three?  T. Rogers Thirty-four.  H. Rogers Thirty-four, just turned thirty-four. I think, over the last fifteen years, there  was a lot of questions as to whether or not we had been successful or not,  but of late, it   s, we were very successful. We were very blessed, and I think  the biggest key to that success is do, don   t tell. If you   re consistent in your,  how you live your life, people tend to emulate success.  Finchum Live by example.  H. Rogers Exactly, live by example, and that   s, I mean, I   m too dumb to teach anybody  in a structured environment. It   s just,    Hey, come follow me. Let   s go do  this.    That   s actually amazing, what you say. Those that I work for at  Halliburton now want to be extremely structured. They try to force me to be  extremely structured and regimented in how things work, and for all of the  things that I   ve told you about myself, one of the aspects that I struggle with  is the mentoring factor. They want me to mentor the way they want you to  mentor. The way I do it is just,    Let   s go.     I just finished two weeks of testing in Duncan, and I   m the most senior  person in the group almost completely. There   s one guy that   s got more  years than me, but yet I   m in Duncan wearing a pair of coveralls and a  hardhat. We   re right in the middle of the thick of things, doing stuff. That   s  the way I was raised, and to this day, I think a big part of my success is  because I was raised working that way. I understood things. People didn   t  have to tell me why we   re doing this test, why we have to have all these  things. I just knew it because I had done it a thousand times.  I had some opportunities with Halliburton to interview new employees or  new college graduates, and one of the questions that I interjected several  times was the rhetorical question,    If you wake up in the morning and you  go out to your car and there   s a flat tire, what do you do?    You   d be  surprised how many people call a taxi, call a friend, call AAA, blah, blah,  blah versus    Well, I change the tire.    It seems obvious, but you   d be amazed  how many people don   t do that. I choose to be with the guy that says change  the tire. (Laughs) Just proactively recognize the problem and identify a  solution, and let   s do it. Let   s make it happen, and then we   ll go on.  Finchum I get out the manual     H. Rogers Exactly   Finchum    and then follow the instructions. (Laughter)  H. Rogers Just the idea of,    My water pump   s out on my car.    Do you take it to the car  shop, or do you change it yourself? I   m a very hands-on, mechanically-oriented  individual, and I think I learned by showing and by doing.  Finchum Well, is there more men, more men in your area of work than women?  H. Rogers Well, okay. That   s a good question. Over time. Let   s start out when I first  started to work, when I first started to, say, go into the field or working in  the technology environment. When I started to work, I don   t know that there  was any women. I mean, they were very few and far between in the  engineering realm. Not secretaries, drafters, things like that, but in, say,  from an engineering perspective, it was very, very low. Now there   s a, at  least with my company, there   s a lot of focus on gender diversification, and  they actually put priority not only on hiring women but hiring minorities and  hiring culturally diverse groups of individuals. Now it   s not only in  Halliburton but in the oil companies. There   s a lot more women involved in  every aspect of the business, I mean, everywhere.  Finchum There would have to be some trained before you can have some to work.  H. Rogers Right, yeah. I mean, they go through the engineering. I   ve been on offshore  platforms where there were the roustabouts, the roughnecks, the people  that   s doing the non-skilled labor jobs, and then when given an opportunity,  they do very well.  Finchum Interesting.  H. Rogers Statistically, it   s still probably low at that area, but it   s changing continually.  The gender gap is completely, it   s becoming blurred significantly, yes, and  from an engineering perspective, very much so. It doesn   t really matter.  Finchum Math, math.  H. Rogers Exactly. Can you add and subtract? End of story. Do you understand action,  reaction? Do you understand things like that?  Finchum Well, the people that you work with, are they aware that you   re an OSU  grad?  H. Rogers Yeah. Yep, yep.  Finchum (Laughs) Do you wear orange some to work?  H. Rogers I do. I do. Yes, and if we had had the interview at my office, you   d see the  big OSU flag hanging on my wall.  Finchum Have you been up to Walkaround for Homecoming?  H. Rogers Yes. We were up there last year, actually. Yep, last year is when we were  there last.  Finchum The pipes are already showing up for the decorations. (Laughs)  H. Rogers Yep, yep. Won   t be long.  Finchum Well, is there anything else you want to add before I ask my last question?  H. Rogers I don   t know. I tend to ramble so much.  Finchum You   ve done very good. Advice for incoming students?  H. Rogers My advice for incoming students is master the fundamentals. You got to  read. You got to write. You have to add and subtract. I mean, in a  technology environment (I   ll use myself an example), we have designed  tools, and then we design tests to evaluate that tool   s performance. Then you  write reports on the test that you did. Well, today, when I go back and look  at reports that I wrote in the early    90s, I ask myself,    Why did my manager  let me do that?    because they were pathetic.  Learn. Learn. You can   t get past reading and writing and being able to  communicate both verbally and in writing. Learn the fundamentals. You  need to master the fundamentals so you can be successful doing difficult  things. If you ever want to do difficult things, you need to master the  fundamentals. I don   t know. Study. Do what your professor says. Turn your  homework in. Go to class. She got me in trouble. I had one class that I had, I  got a B in. It was an electrical class, and electrical things came very easy to  me, circuitry and stuff. It was a twelve thirty to one thirty class. It was  during her lunch hour, obviously, and she was on campus. I was continually  being late for that class, and it really didn   t bother me because I mean, I was,  the homework was absolutely not a problem. The tests were absolutely not a  problem, but all of a sudden, it came grade time. I got a B, and it was so  frustrating. I even went to the professor and asked. I said,    Look at all the  tests. I   m obviously not a B student.     Well, if I remember correctly (I   ll just use this as an example), there was a  thousand points possible in the class. A hundred and twenty points was  quizzes. Well, in all of my other stuff, I had maybe gotten 850 out of 880  points, but out of the quizzes, I missed so many classes because quizzes  were at the beginning of the hour, and I didn   t show up for fifteen minutes  later. I missed so many quizzes, thirty out of a hundred and twenty, fifty out  of a hundred and twenty. I was basically below the 940 mark or whatever it  took to get an A, and the problem was there was one student between me  and there. I was trying to get him to move me up.    Move me up.    He said,    I  can   t move you up without moving him up, and he   s not an A student.    I got  a B in that class because of her. (Laughter)  The point there is understand the program, and I stressed this with our kids,  our kids is understanding the whole program. I   m assuming college is like it  was when I was there, at least fundamentally. You know upfront what you  have to have to finish, and you need to learn the system. You need to make  sure that you do what you   re supposed to do. Do your ABCs, and you can  keep track. I will tell my kids,    In the tenth week of school, you should  know exactly where you   re at.    (Laughs) I mean, there   s no guessing.  There   s no surprises. If you have done your homework and you   ve tracked  it, other than stuff the professor hasn   t given you back yet, you should know  exactly where you stand.  Finchum That   s a very hard lesson to teach. Yes.  H. Rogers I don   t know how to, yeah, that stuff, but that   s it.  Finchum You made A   s in all the other classes?  H. Rogers No, no, and actually, probably the one story that I   ll say because remember I  worked all the time. I didn   t make as good of grades. My GPA wasn   t what  it should have been, in hindsight. My senior year, again, I was focused on  graduating in four years. I mean, that was my goal. I went to summer school  between my junior and senior year. I took nine hours. I had to take two  classes concurrently that were supposed to be prerequisite, but the professor  let me do it.  My senior semester, I only needed twenty-one hours to graduate. I took  twenty-two hours my senior year, senior semester, and worked at Oberlin  Color Press two weeks on, two weeks off, from eleven pm to seven am and  was married in February of that semester. That was the toughest semester I  had, but I finished it.  We had our third son, we kept hammering him. After the first two, we  finally said,    We   ll pay for four years of school. We   ll support you for four  years, eight semesters, twelve if you count summer, I guess, but after four  years, we   re done.    Everybody says,    Nobody can graduate in eight  semesters. It takes ten. It takes twelve. It takes fifty thousand semesters.     No, it doesn   t, and our son, our third son graduated in four years, on time.  As he was going through his senior year, he began looking at the end, and  we would ask him,    Aren   t you glad you graduate next May instead of  having a whole other year to go?     Then I would explain it to them. I said,    You realize that   s not only a whole  other year of cost, living expenses, and existing but that   s a year that you   re  deferring your income. That   s a whole other year. You could make twenty-five  thousand dollars. You could have made forty-five thousand dollars this  time next year if you had graduated in May like you were supposed to.     Again, I was just real unforgiving about thou shalt do this. By golly, that   s, I  mean, I   m not worried about what everybody else does. It   s called a  curriculum, and you plan your schedule. You do it, and again, I didn   t do all  the activities that lots of people do and stuff. For me, it was an easy  decision, but my advice to students is stay focused, learn the fundamentals,  and don   t get behind because getting behind is bad.  Finchum And be on time to class.  H. Rogers Be on time to class. Exactly. Go to class, and develop a relationship, rapport  with the instructors. Sit up front so he sees you or she sees you. Get them to  where they recognize you, and don   t be afraid to ask them. By and large,  they   re not quite as mean as what they appear to be. Thank you. (Laughter)  The last question.  Finchum No. A couple more.  H. Rogers Uh-oh   Finchum We   ve been trying to ask if people can explain what loyalty is to OSU. What  is it about OSU that spurs people to have loyalty to the University?  H. Rogers Well, that   s a very broad, correct question, and not just talking about OSU  but just loyalty to anything, commitment to anything, whether it be an  employer, be it a state of Oklahoma and Oklahoma pride. I mean, to me, it   s  just, it   s family. It   s relationship. It   s kindred spirits. It   s agreement in,    I  liked this. This was good when I was there, and I support it now. I want you,  my kids, to have the same memories that I had. I want you to have the same  opportunities to experience this, this, and this that I had,    and it just breeds  the whole attitude of    Come with me. This is fun. Let   s go. Let   s do this     versus    That was the worst, darkest time of my life, and I would never make  my kids do that at all.    The two attitudes of the parents and the graduates,  the alumni that speak positively about their experience and contribute in  both time and talent and finances to the University. It comes back to it was  something that was good in their mind, and they want to propagate it for  future generations.  Finchum Okay, last question. Where do you consider home?  H. Rogers Well, now I guess home is wherever we are, which is right here. If I look at  the broader picture, for me and my family background, home is in Duncan. I  was raised there. My dad was raised there, all of his siblings. He was  the   nine kids, they were all raised in Duncan. All went to Empire. I think  they   re all, all of the siblings are dead but two now. There   s two sisters that  are still alive, but home is the old home place that I was raised at in Duncan,  Oklahoma.  Finchum A little bit broader, Oklahoma?  H. Rogers Absolutely, Oklahoma, absolutely.  Finchum You   ve had opportunity you could have lived   ?  H. Rogers I could have lived in several places in the U.S., as well as other countries  around the world. That   s actually a good question. It spurs a different  question. In all of my travels around the world, remember I   ve been to a  little over fifty countries, and a whole lot of them are countries that you  don   t go to on vacations. It   s the developing countries, third-world  countries. People are constantly asking,    Where   s the favorite place you   ve  ever been? Where would you like to, what   s the best place you   ve ever  been?    Sometimes you can   t be honest because of who you   re talking to, but  whether you   re in the deserts or the jungles or in the ice or in the frigid parts  of the world, my answer is there   s no place like home.  Wherever home is at, that   s the politically correct answer because I   ve seen  guys that came from developing countries to the United States and worked  here for three, four, five, six months on a training program, maybe a year,  maybe eighteen months. I look at them, and I say,    How can you be  homesick? How can you not       because sometimes they have an  opportunity to stay but they choose to go home. I ask myself, or I used to  ask myself,    Why would you miss an opportunity to stay in the United  States versus going back to where you   re having  to struggle . I know where  you   re going. I   ve been there, and it   s not an easy place to live in  comparison.     It all comes back to there   s no place like home. That   s where family   s at.  That   s where friends are at. That   s where everything that you know is at,  and that will get you through lots of hardships. Some people move, and they  only work for money. If you work for money, you   re going to hate your job  because you   re going to always say you   re not making enough money, but if  you decide that you actually enjoy what you   re doing, they can never pay  you enough because you enjoy what you do. Same thing. There   s no place  like home, where you hang your hat.  Finchum A cowboy hat, in this case. (Laughter)  H. Rogers There you go, absolutely, and cowboy boots.  Finchum (Laughs) Well, thank you very much for talking with us. You   re a great  representative for OSU. Thank you.  H. Rogers Thank you. I took two hours.  T. Rogers Almost. (Laughs)  Finchum Not too bad.  H. Rogers That   s a long transcript.  Finchum One more thing.  H. Rogers Okay. There was one particular class that was a strength of materials class. I  don   t remember. There was two professors teaching the class. One was Dr.  Neathery, and I don   t know if he   s still at OSU or not. My presumption is  he   s not. It was over thirty years ago, and he was a grown adult then.  (Laughs) My guess is he   s long since retired, but everybody said,    Don   t  take Dr. Neathery   s class. Don   t take his section.    Don   t take his section for  two reasons. Number one, he was the dean of the school, dean of the  college, and number two, they were teaching out of his textbook.    Don   t  take Dr. Neathery.     When I enrolled in the class, I obviously did what everybody told me to do,  as I enrolled in the other guy   s class, whose name I don   t even remember.  That tells you how much influence he had on me, but when I showed up at  the class, I   m sitting on the front row as I typically did. Here comes Dr.  Neathery walking in. Turns out the professors had swapped sections. Now  I   ve got Dr. Neathery.  Well, at this point in time, I am, I   m basically looking at my watch, waiting  on the clock to tick, tick, tick, and I   m leaving. As quick as I can get to the  Student Union, I   m going to go stand in line because back then, again,  there   s no computers. You have to go stand in line. You have to fill out the  card, and you had to hand it to the girl or the guy to change sections. That   s  it. That   s all I was waiting to do, and over the course of the next thirty or  forty minutes, Dr. Neathery came in. One of the things that he said that just  really struck me is he said,    You guys can take this class one of two ways:  seriously or again. It   s totally up to you.     Of course that was his  intimidation factor. He was scaring us to death.  Of course I   d already heard,    Don   t take him,    but due to other factors in his  monologue that morning, I decided that    I think I can get along with this  guy.    I decided to stay, and I ended up staying in his class. It turns out he  was a, as I said earlier in the presentation, he was an outstanding professor.  He was great. He used to work for General Motors, and he used to crash cars  into concrete walls. He would always say every day,    Don   t forget to buckle  up. Don   t forget to buckle up.    Before buckling up was totally politically  correct, much less the law, he was constantly saying,    Buckle up. Buckle up.  Somebody wants to see you when you get to where you   re going,    and he  was a great influence. He was a great instructor. I   ve still got his book, his  textbook.  The introduction on the textbook says,    Well, sometimes you need to talk  about baseball, hot dogs, apple pies, and Chevrolets,    and then he,    Oh wait,  I digress. We   re here to talk about strength of materials.    He goes on. That  was the introduction of his textbook, but that was his personality. He was  kind of a, I mean, I don   t know. I can see where people could be afraid of  him,    Seriously or again. Come on. Get your act together,    but if you just  got past, if you would put forth any effort in his class, he would put forth ten  times that much effort back at you to make sure you understood what you  were doing or that you needed to, you understood what you needed to know  to be successful. It was a great example of a good professor-student  relationship, in my opinion, and that was good.  Finchum How many finished the class with you?  H. Rogers I don   t even remember. I don   t even remember.  Finchum Some dropped that day, but   .  H. Rogers We were in a room, big room, thirty, forty, fifty people. I honestly don   t  remember. Way too long ago.  Finchum Do you remember your grade?  H. Rogers Oh, I   m sure it was an A.  Finchum You   re sure?  H. Rogers Yeah. (Laughter) In the mechanical side, they were always, it was pretty  steady. It was the non-major-specific classes that sometimes I struggled  with.  Finchum Psychology, sociology, that type of thing?  H. Rogers Yeah, yeah. I like things when there   s an answer, that everybody comes to  the same conclusion. That   s the nice thing about math. It all adds up no  matter. (Laughs) Now there   s different ways to get there, but the answer   s  the same, generally speaking. That   s it.  Finchum All right. Thank you for sharing that one.  H. Rogers Yeah, I remembered another one.  -------  -------
