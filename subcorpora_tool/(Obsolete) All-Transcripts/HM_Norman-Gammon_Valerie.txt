Speaker 1: Hi this is Lynn Norment interviewing for the HistoryMakers Valerie Norman-Gammon.  Could you please state your name and location and the date for the record?
Speaker 2: Alright my name is Valerie Norman-Gammon.  The location is HistoryMakers, 1900 S. Michigan Avenue in Chicago [Illinois] and today is August 22, 2012.
Story_ID: 42321
Speaker 1: Thank you.  For the HistoryMakers' interview we want to talk about--you know we want to pretty much start at the beginning as you remember it.  So we want to talk about your mother [Irene Hall], your father [Edmund Greene], your mother's family, your father's family and what you can remember about that.  So what is your mother's name?
Speaker 2: My mother's name her maiden name was Irene Hall, her married name was Irene Sandra Hall Robinson.  She was born in Senatobia, Mississippi.  She was raised in Memphis, Tennessee and as a young woman, I'd say around 19-20 years old she moved to New York City and lived in Manhattan.  She originally lived up in Harlem [New York City, New York] and then she moved to 200 W. 90th Street which at that time and still does have four buildings; four doorman buildings.  She was one of three African Americans who moved into 200 which is on the corner of Columbus Avenue and 90th street.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well let's hold up before we go too far there.  Your mother's parents do you recall anything about your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My grandmother who I called grandma Verma they called her Verma Clair.
Speaker 1: How do you spell her name?
Speaker 2: V-E-R-M-A, C-L-A-I-R was married to a man named Allen Hall and they had my mother who was Irene Hall.  And I remember them in Memphis [Tennessee].  At the time, I'm trying to think back, I remember being with my grandmother, my great grandmother, my great aunt in Memphis in the summers as a little girl.  My grandfather lived in New Jersey because my grandmother and my grandfather, as I remember as a little girl, were divorced.  So I would spend some times with my grandfather and then I would spend many, many summers with my mother's mother's family in Memphis.
Speaker 1: In Memphis.  So your grandfather was from New Jersey and you spent time with him.
Speaker 2: We spent some time with him because he had a large family, he had ten brothers and sisters so we were always having a good time but that was east and Memphis was south, obviously.
Story_ID: 42322
Speaker 1: Do you recall them talking about their relatives going beyond that generation that you were exposed to?  Anybody have history going back to slavery?
Speaker 2: Yes, my great grandmother was born in 1818 and her name was Mary Lou Armstrong--Mary Lee Armstrong and she was married to a man who we called grandpa Ebbie (ph. splg.) and they were I'm trying to think of how to really describe them in my memory.  They had a house on a block that was on the corner--the white house, the big white house and next to them was a little store that and this is like 1957-58.
Speaker 1: And what city were we talking about?
Speaker 2: We are talking about Memphis, Tennessee.  And they had the biggest house on the street and they used to tell stories about their parents and slavery and riding on the back of the bus and all of the different things that we know to be our history.  But my memories of any discussions with those types of experiences came from my great grandmother and my great grandfather in Memphis and my grandmother.  So I would spend summers there and we would sit on the porch and rock, you know in a rocking swing that you see in the South a lot and they would tell me just about stories of being back in slavery and the problems that we had then with black men not being able to look at white women, black folks not being able to go into the same door, having to go in the back, not being able to sit at the counters, picking cotton and all of that, you know.  And I actually with my grandmother went to pick tomatoes in Memphis; I never had that experience before but it was very commonplace to them.
Story_ID: 42323
Speaker 1: And picked tomatoes not just from a garden--.
Speaker 2: No out in the field.
Speaker 1: A big tomato field.
Speaker 2: Big tomato field and I remember sitting on a barrel and bending over and I had on a top and the top raised up and by the time I got home my backside was sunburned because I had never had this experience and didn't know what to wear and my hands were aching and my body was tired and I remember saying to my grandmother [Verma Clair], I just don't know how you did that all the time every day.  It was a one day event for me but it was their lives.
Speaker 1: And how old were you at the point that you went with your grandmother to do that?
Speaker 2: I was probably twelve, probably twelve.
Speaker 1: And she was doing this to make money as a job?
Speaker 2: She was doing it to make money yes she was doing it to make money.  And my great aunt was washing clothes and ironing for-to make money at that same time.  I remember that she would get up because they all lived together in Memphis [Tennessee] in this big house and we would go my brother and I--we would go every summer and spend the summers there in Memphis.  So as a small child I would do different things with them.  I would get on a bus and we would go to the back and I was living in New York, I came from Manhattan [New York, New York] and so I didn't know what was going on and didn't understand that at all.  And I would ask them--we were going to pick the tomatoes, we are getting into the back of the bus, why are we doing this?  And they would say this is what we do, this is exactly what we do.
Speaker 1: Did they further explain segregation and racism in the South that kind of thing or just--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Just in terms--they explained it in terms of casual conversation.  We didn't have long discussions about it because I wasn't living in the South, you know.  I lived in Manhattan [New York City, New York] and I lived in a doorman building and I lived differently but the richness I think of my history in terms of my family came from those times in Memphis.  In the evening when the sun would go down we'd sit on the porch and the swing and they'd tell me different stories.  But I think that they wanted me to know but they did not want me to be tainted by it because I lived a different life.
Story_ID: 42324
Speaker 1: Can you remember any specific stories maybe you haven't mentioned already?  You said they would tell you stories.
Speaker 2: My grandmother--my great grandmother [Mary Lee Armstrong] not my grandmother but my great grandmother who was born in 1818 would tell me stories after my great grandfather died.  Because we would sit on the porch there was a chair on this side of the porch and there was a swing over there and then there was another chair over there where we would all sit and she would tell us stories.  When I say us I mean my mother as well because my mother [Irene Hall] didn't have that experience either.  And so she would tell us stories about how she and my great grandfather would go and they would pick their food and they would pick their tomatoes and they would pick their vegetables and get on, I guess, like a van or a bus and there would be just sixty or seventy people.  There would be several buses and they'd go one place.  They would all get on; they'd spend the day in the hot sun picking all their barrels, moving the barrels, lining them up.  She'd say we used to pick them, when you filled them up you walked and you would line them up and then they would go back and they would pick some more and at the end of the day a whistle would blow and they would all get back on the bus and then they would come back.
Speaker 1: And they lived in Memphis [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: They lived in Mississippi.
Speaker 1: In Mississippi this was Mississippi.
Speaker 2: They lived in Mississippi.  But it was in Memphis when I was growing up that they were telling me the stories.  Because they met in Mississippi and they married in Mississippi and they lived under all of the things that we know to be historical.
Story_ID: 42325
Speaker 1: Do you remember any sights, sounds, smells from that period of being in Memphis with your grandparents?
Speaker 2: I remember many things, I'm just thinking.  I remember going with my great aunt and my grandmother--my great grandmother, not my grandmother but my great grandmother [Mary Lee Armstrong] downtown and we would walk two blocks to the corner to catch the car, they called it the car at the time, and the car was connected to the rails and the sparks would spark and we would wait and we would see the car coming and the sparks would spark and we would get on and go to the back and the three of us would sit and they would seat me in between the two of them in the back.  I vividly remember that.  I remember hanging the clothes on the line in the back of the house and my great aunt washing them.  I remember her knuckles and her hands being just telling the story.  I'm just thinking and visualizing her now because as I said, she would go everyday and work in a white woman's house, caring for her kids, washing the clothes, ironing.  She could iron like a shirt like it came out of the cleaners.  But I remember her being in the back and when she would wash on the washboard, I remember the sound of that and her hands going very vividly and her washing the clothes.  I also remember my grandmother making ice cream on the back porch.  The ice turning and the smell of that and the taste of it, there have never been any ice cream like that ever since and I remember that.  I remember getting in this big bath tub that we had in the back of the house and I remember my grandmother putting just enough water to come up over my bottom because they paid for water and I remember thinking that when I went home to Manhattan [New York, New York] my mother would fill up the tub and get into a nice bath.  So I remember all those kinds of things which to me were very rich and special.  I also remember sitting down in front of a coal machine in the living room area and crossing my legs and my grandmother braiding my hair.  I used to have long braids and putting Glover's Mange which was a pomade that you mixed up to make your hair grow and it smelled so terrible, so terrible but it made your hair grow and that's what they used on little girls hair back in the 1950s and early '60s [1960s].  I remember all those smells and that's very vivid.
Story_ID: 42326
Speaker 1: What about the kinds of foods that you may have eaten?  I know you mentioned ice cream did you have fried green tomatoes?
Speaker 2: Oh we had okra, we had always--there was a round table, big beautiful antique table or antique now obviously that's in our family and every day there was a glass bowl that sat on the table that had sliced tomatoes and onions and vinegar; always on the table.  And my great grandmother, my grandmother [Verna Clair] would make hot water cornbread and collard greens and sit and take the tomatoes and the green and the vinegar and put it on there and eat it.  And my grandmother used to--my great grandmother [Mary Lee Armstrong] would reach down and eat it with her hands, I remember all of that; that was so wonderful.
Speaker 1: How about homemade biscuits?
Speaker 2: They made homemade biscuits, they made smothered chicken with gravy, they made fried fish, they made the okra, they made oh God such good food, such good food on black kettle skillets.  And I actually have two of those, I have one that's very small and then I have one that's bigger that's been passed down five generations.
Story_ID: 42327
Speaker 1: Now this is your mother's family that you are telling about now.  What about your father's [Edmund Greene] side of the family, what about his parents?
Speaker 2: I did not know my father's parents.  I did not know them at all.  I met my father once when I was five years old.  My mother [Irene Hall] and my father were not married and my father and mother did not necessarily get along and so at the beginning of my education I was in private school for three years and then my mother put me in public school.  I did not see my father again until I was nineteen.  And even though I had heard about my father and I knew that I had one brother in particular, I just didn't have any connection with him because he and my mother did not communicate.  But I always wanted to meet him and in the building that we lived in, I think I mentioned before that my mother was one of three blacks that lived in that building at that time and one of the other residents was Sugar Ray Robinson's wife and she was a friend of ours.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: What was her name?  I'm just trying to remember her name.  Edna Mae Robinson and Edna Mae was beautiful and she was always very fit and she had these classes that she was giving in her house.  She was very fit, she was very beautiful but she would give these classes and different people that she knew including myself would go down and take these classes with her. And one day--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: What kind of classes?
Speaker 2: Fitness classes, yoga classes well not yoga but you know stretching and all of that kind of thing; just on a Saturday.  One day everyone had left, she lived on the sixth floor--she lived on 6A and we lived on 7B.  Same side of the building because there were two sides to this building.  And I would just come down the stairs and go to Edna Mae's house.  Anyway we were talking one day and I don't remember exactly how we got on to the subject of my father but we did and she said Greene because my maiden name was Greene, G-R-E-E-N-E and she said was your father named Eddy Greene and I said yeah and she said wait.  She went into her bedroom and I could hear her so I followed her and I said what are you doing?  She was on a stool reaching for something on the top of her closet and she pulled out a photo and she said is this your father?  And I looked at him in this photo and I thought that might be my father because we looked alike so I took the photo up the stairs; I ran up the stairs and I showed the photo to my mother who tried to grab it.  So of course then I knew that was my father.  And ironically, truly as God would have it, and I had a conversation with my mother, she wanted to know where I got the photo and I told her where I got the photo.  As God would have it two or three weeks later Edna Mae was in Bloomingdales on 59th Street and Lexington and she ran into my father and she said I know your daughter and he said you do and she said would you like to meet her?  And he said I would.  She came back and she told me and at the time my best friend lived in Harlem [New York City, New York] on 112th Street between 7th and 8th and I would go up and spend the night with her from time to time.  So I went out bought this beautiful black and white dress, I'll never forget it was a crepe dress with a little flared bottom.  And I was getting ready to get dressed up to go meet daddy.  So I told my mother that I was going to spend the night with my girlfriend who lived with her grandmother and who now knew the story.  We had taken the dress up there; I went to spend the night with her but I went up there and got dress and then I got in a cab and went to meet my father in a restaurant in Harlem that Edna Mae Robinson set up for us.  And I walked in and there he was.
Speaker 1: How old were you?
Speaker 2: I was nineteen.
Story_ID: 42328
Speaker 1: And that was your first time meeting your father [Edmund Greene]?
Speaker 2: It was the first time.  I had been told that I had met him when I was five and I had a little ring that had two hearts on it with diamond chips; one with a V and a G and my mother [Irene Hill] had told me my father had given me that.  And that was all that I've ever had of him, you know of his.  And he and I met, you know, I loved him.  Like little girls love their fathers, I loved him.  And for several months after that I would meet him and we would have lunch.  He took me into Tiffany's to teach me about Steuben glass.  We would walk 5th Avenue and we would go and dine in Central Park and we would just have father/daughter time and my mother didn't know it because my mother had her own issues with my father.  But at the time my father said to me I want to help you, we never talked about what happened between he and my mother, but he said I want to help you and I had told him from time to time I would stay in Brooklyn [New York City, New York] with a cousin while I was in college because my mother and I had like many daughter/mother relationships from time to time we didn't get along.  But we loved each other deeply.  And so I would go and I would stay with my cousin, he said I need for you to go back and stay with your mother and if you do that when you graduate I will completely furnish everything; I said okay.  Time went by and one day I was out having lunch with a girlfriend of mine and now we are in college and originally before I went--I know we are not at the point of college but I had started going to a city university.  I was coming down the street there was this huge crowd in the street.  My girlfriend and I are walking and there was a door to go into the college.  Went into the door and my father was staying there but the crowd was outside because my father had the first Maserati that was brought to this country.  So the crowds were outside looking at this car; he was inside waiting for me because a student had told him that that was the entrance or what have you.  I saw him that day, he asked me how are you coming along with this move with your mom and I said I'm working on it; I'm going to do it.  He said okay, he said let's go for lunch.  He gave me some money, we talked and the next week the doorman pushes the buzzer and says Valerie we have a delivery for you but you need to look out the window.  I looked out the window and there were these two long moving vans out the window and my father had sent all this furniture.  He didn't wait until I graduated, he sent the furniture then.  After that I decided because my mother was like what is going on here so I told her what had happened and, of course, again she had her own relationship with him.  But I asked her if I could just sit and have one time in my life where I am sitting with my mother and my father at the same table; she agreed to do that.  The next day I contacted him, he came and we all met and we talked and it was an interesting conversation to say the least.  And he left and some of the furniture came into the apartment the rest of it went into storage and that was the last time I saw him.
Story_ID: 42329
Speaker 1: That was the last time you saw him.  So over a period of how many years were you in touch with your father [Edmund Greene]?
Speaker 2: About a year and a half.
Speaker 1: Only about a year and a half.  And what did he do for a living that he could have a Maserati and buy you this furniture?
Speaker 2: He was a business man, he had several antique shops and he loved the finer things in life.  His best friend was Joe Louis and that's all I can tell you.
Speaker 1: Was your father an African American?
Speaker 2: My father was African American but he did not look like he was African American.
Speaker 1: And you mentioned you had a brother so he had a son.
Speaker 2: He had a son; my brother is the junior the Edmund Greene, Jr.
Story_ID: 42330
Speaker 1: Now I want to back up and in telling your story about your father [Edmund Greene], thank you for sharing that.  Now I want to go back to your childhood, you talked about that some being in Memphis [Tennessee] with your maternal grandparents and great grandparents, tell me about your life in New York City [New York] with your mother [Irene Hall].  You know, from the earlier years and obviously you all lived in a very well to do part of the town and so tell me about that and your memories from that period of your life.
Speaker 2: I remember that my mother who is a beautiful woman looked a lot like Lena Horne and men loved her because she was beautiful and she worked originally I remember two different places that she worked that impacted my life.  She worked at the American Stock Exchange and she worked in Bergdorf Goodman.  Bergdorf's obviously is a store that's in New York, a very expensive store.  My mother was a--she worked in the store as a retail clerk and I used to go there as a sales woman.  And I would go there and she would always teach me the finer things.  She would say not how much you have it's really what you have.  It's better for you to buy something that is better made, better fabric not because it costs more but because it's better and it will last longer.  She wanted me--because she had good taste, she had style and she wanted me to have those things and to really understand that.  And so when I was a little girl about six years old there was a young man probably maybe he was sixteen/seventeen who loved to ice skate and my mother would send me with him to Rockefeller Center.  To this day when I arrive in New York City I always go to Rockefeller Center first.  And I had this little red velvet outfit and I would go down and skate in Rockefeller Center and often I was the only black child skating in Rockefeller Center.  Because this is in the mid--late 1950s and he would pick me up, we'd skate all of that and then he would bring me back home.  That's a very vivid memory of mine and I see myself doing that every time I go to New York, I always have to go there.
Speaker 1: Now what was he, a friend?
Speaker 2: He was just a neighbor in the building.
Speaker 1: You said a white guy?
Speaker 2: Young white guy.
Story_ID: 42331
Speaker 1: Tell me about your building again.
Speaker 2: Our building which is obviously still there, 200 W. 90th Street [New York City, New York].  The doorman, I go by there now and there are people there, doorman there that have known me all my life.  And you come in the building, walk up a couple of stairs and there would be these glass doors and when you went through there was a huge lobby and there were two sides to the building.  We lived on the left side of the building, the building is fifteen stories high and we lived in 7B; pre-war building, big ceilings, big rooms, garbage shoots where you put the garbage on your on floor and just straight on down.  And I remember as a small child--excuse me as a small child playing in the front of the building and there was a grid you know how in New York they have the grids and could look down in them and we would look down and see pennies down in there and put gum on a string and drop the gum on the string down in there to get the money.  So we would play in the front of the house because we couldn't play anyplace else because my mother could look out and see us, me and my little friends in the building.  I had one girlfriend that lived on the other side of the building, young white girl who was one of my best friends and she had hamsters and we would go and peek at her hamsters but she and I used to play in the front of the building all the time and so I remember that, the ice skating, the playing in the front as a child.
Speaker 1: So tell me about the actual apartment that your mother and you lived in.  How big was it and how many rooms?
Speaker 2: There were two bedrooms, a dining room, a living room, a big kitchen, a big foyer, the high ceilings, the crown molding, the bathrooms with the big tubs, the big tubs with all the showers.  It's funny because those buildings back then had all the kinds of showers that we are trying to get now in luxury building.  But for whatever reason they had them so my mother would always take these luxurious baths which is what I would take or if we were taking a shower we had all these different shower heads which seems kind of strange now in 2012.
Speaker 1: This is the late '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 2: Umm hmmm at 200 W. 90th Street, apartment 7B.
Story_ID: 42332
Speaker 1: Again, this is Lynne Norment for the HistoryMakers interviewing Valerie Norman-Gammon and the videographer today is Matthew Hickey and Dan Newman is observing he is also a videographer.  Valerie what is your date of birth and where were you born?
Speaker 2: I was born in New York City [New York], Women's Hospital on May 14, 1951.
Speaker 1: What are your earliest memories, you may not remember the day you were born but what are your earliest memories on that?
Speaker 2: I remember having birthday parties.
Speaker 1: I had a couple of other questions I need to ask at the beginning, thank you.  So what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food is pasta, I love pasta.  So I love Italian food.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What is your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Purple, I love purple.  Purple is power, my favorite color.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What is your favorite season or time of the year?
Speaker 2: Christmas is my favorite season and I think that it's my favorite season because it always reminds me of Rockefeller Center in my childhood because as a child my mother [Irene Hall] would take me every Christmas season to look at the windows on 5th Avenue.  So it's just, oh God I love that season and I remember that and I'm always telling friends of mine who have little girls you need to take them to New York [New York] at Christmas and show them the windows.
Speaker 1: And what is your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: St. Barts and St. Martens.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And is there a favorite saying or quote someone else's quote or your motto, words you live by?
Speaker 2: Well I'm always saying it's got to be fabulous, you know, and people tease me about that.  If it is not fabulous, she doesn't want it.  So I always say it has to be fabulous.
Speaker 1: And how would you define fabulous?
Speaker 2: Something of excellence, distinct, unique, exclusive, high end, first class.
Speaker 1: Fabulous.
Speaker 2: Fabulous exactly fabulous.
Story_ID: 42333
Speaker 1: Now let's get back to your earliest childhood memories.
Speaker 2: Well, the playing in front, my earliest childhood memories.  My mother [Irene Hall] used to give me birthday parties and the birthday parties would have the biggest, most beautiful cakes with all kinds of little girl things on them and I would have the biggest, prettiest pink birthday cap with the little string and we would have these parties with all of this fun.  I remember those and we would take photographs of them.  She always wanted to do the special things for me and I remember those things.  And I remember going to Memphis [Tennessee] in the summer and playing with my girlfriend next door who had twelve brothers and sisters and a little bitty house and we would play in the street until the lights went off because you know when I was younger you could not play once the lights went off you had to be in the house.  And we would play in cardboard boxes like we had cars and my girlfriend's brothers would be pulling us up and down the street and then we would play double dutch and we played with jacks and balls, just fun in the street in Memphis in the summer and in New York.
Speaker 1: What age--the birthday party what age were you then you think?
Speaker 2: Five that I remember, four or five, six.
Speaker 1: And then in Memphis same age?
Speaker 2: I might have been spoiled in Memphis.  They tell me that I was spoiled in Memphis.  My grandmother [Verma Clair] used to bathe me twice a day, you know, that's what they tell me.  I remember being bathed because I would be outside playing in the dirt messing up my little ironed dresses.  My aunt who I told you could iron like she owns a cleaners and I would come in dirty and they would put me right in the bath tub so they told me that I ended up being bathed twice a day because I'd go out and get dirty and come back and I'd have to be bathed again.
Speaker 1: So were you a little tom girl?
Speaker 2: No I was not a tom girl but I was spoiled apparently.  When I listen to family talk about me as a little girl they say oh you know you were so spoiled but I was prissy.  You know my friends tell me I'm prissy now so I was prissy.  I liked little dresses, I liked the little pink shoes and the socks to match and the bows in my hair and all of that, and I loved all of that stuff.  So, you know I'm a girly girl.
Story_ID: 42334
Speaker 1: Now how-I know your mother [Irene Hall] grew up in Memphis [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: My mother grew up in Memphis.
Speaker 1: And how did she end up in New York [New York City, New York], do you know that story at all?
Speaker 2: I know that my mother always wanted to be in the big city.  My mother always had big dreams; big visions and she wanted to be where the glamour was.  She didn't necessarily--she loved the South because that's where she was from but she hungered, I think based upon some conversations that we had, for a faster pace, a different life and so she chose to move to New York.
Speaker 1: Do you know how she ended up there, did you have relatives that helped her, did she get a job or what was it?
Speaker 2: I don't know how that happened.  I know that her father [Allen Hall] lived right outside in New Jersey so my understanding is that she would go and spend time with her father and so I assumed that her father would take her over to New York or what have you but she wanted to be there and so she did.  She always wanted to be where the action was.
Story_ID: 42335
Speaker 1: Now when you talk of this wonderful apartment you lived in and you obviously remember everything about it and the address and all how were you all able to afford to live in such a seemed like a very nice place and it was an integrated area-neighborhood.  It wasn't a black hood.
Speaker 2: No it wasn't black.  It wasn't black.  That's where she wanted to live and she just worked hard.  My mother really sacrificed for me.  I am seven years older than my brother so for seven years she just really, really worked very hard for us to stay in that building and I know that I remember-I painfully remember that when my mother had times of struggle that she would get some help from my great grandmother [Mary Lee Amrstrong] in Memphis [Tennessee] who I call Mama Mae.  They would send her money and help her; I do remember that.  Because they called her Rene and they wanted Rene to be where Rene wanted to be, Irene was Rene to them and they loved her and they loved me and so they helped her when she was struggling to keep us in there.  Because she was determined that that's where we were going to live because that's who she was.
Speaker 1: So she was rented as opposed to buying?
Speaker 2: Yes it's a rent controlled building.  It actually still is rent controlled building, it's all rent controlled.
Story_ID: 42336
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you remember starting the first grade and what school did you go to?
Speaker 2: I went to-I don't remember the three years that I was in private school but I remember being in PS 199 and I could walk to school and I remember shopping with my mother [Irene Hall] for school clothes and getting my books and walking to school, it was three blocks away.  I remember my mother-my mother was a disciplinarian-she did not play at all and I remember that I would walk home sometimes-I remember a spring day, it was the first day of spring and the weather was wonderful.  I was skipping along, I remember that but I also remember one day when I was late and I looked up and my mother was meeting me half way which was not a good thing.  Wanting to know where are you, it's when you are supposed to be home so I'm coming to get you.  So I remember that, you know, I remember that.  I remember being in school as a young girl and getting involved in a lot of different extracurricular activities.  I liked to write-I loved to write.  I wrote a lot of poems as a young girl.  I remember as I'm talking to you when I was about seven I used to read all the time.  I would read the Nancy Drew, I'd read everything and I loved the Nancy Drew series and I would read and my mother would say you have to turn off the light, it's time to go to bed and I remember having this pink robe and this pink robe-I don't know what fabric it was made out of but I would throw the pink robe over the lamp and continue to read, you know in the dark (laugh) because I was just so enamored with the story.  And one day I took the robe off and the bulb had burned a hole in the robe (laugh) by throwing it over there so much, I remember that.  I would stack my books up in the closet all nice and neat, my whole series.  Next to my doll collection I remember having a unique doll collection that my mother had started for me.  I remember one of my mother's friend bringing us a bird from another country that we called Newbaby and I was fascinated with this bird because there was one room in our house that was empty, that was not furnished and Newbaby was in this room and so I would go in there because you had to cover the bird every night and I would go in there and look at Newbaby.  I remember that Christmas when I was small I knocked over the Christmas tree; we would have these huge Christmas trees in this front room.  We could see it from the tree, beautiful, beautiful trees, fresh not artificial fresh trees.  My mother always had fresh trees and she had fresh green leaves in a big vase when you came into the foyer of our house there was this orange vase with these green leaves, a big bushel.  She would go to the florist and get these leaves; she loved those and I remember those things.  I remember those holidays and the aroma of the leaves and then at Christmas the aroma of the fresh tree and all of the beautiful ornaments that she'd pack away and we would have an evening where we would dress the tree.
Speaker 1: Just the two of you?
Speaker 2: Yes just the two of us.  So I remember those things.
Story_ID: 42337
Speaker 1: Now your school seems to have been pretty significant in the way the architecture and the decor did that stand out to you back in those early years because I understand it was quite significant as far as how it was designed and became a landmark in later years?
Speaker 2: No, my--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Elementary school?
Speaker 2: My elementary school, no not that I remember.
Speaker 1: PS166?
Speaker 2: Not that I remember.  I remember--my memory of the school, you know the school bell.  I could hear the bell ringing, skipping down the street to run into school.  Being with my friends there those are my memories of the school.  I have stronger memories of my high school which was Louis D. Brandeis High School [New York, New York].
Story_ID: 42338
Speaker 1: Brandeis [Louis D. Brandeis High School, New York City, New York].
Speaker 2: Which is where I met some of my friends who are my friends today, friends who I've known for almost forty years.  I remember that school because so many things happened in high school.  I remember standing in line where everyone was lined up based on your last name and because my name was Greene my best friend today her name was Grant and so she was in front of me and we just became buddies and we went everywhere together.  I remember in high school having a teacher who I will never ever forget whose name was Libby Beaman (ph. splg.).  I actually have been looking for her.  Frankly, and my best friend Susan Grant and I have talked about her all the time.  She was way ahead of her time.  She dated an African American man this is 1965.
Speaker 1: Your girlfriend did?
Speaker 2: No the teacher, Libby Beaman.
Speaker 1: Your teacher did.
Speaker 2: She was so encouraging and so supportive of young black kids at a time when that was not common.  She spent a lot of time with me, she was always very open minded and she was very encouraging about my future and I remember her, I really remember her.
Speaker 1: What class did she teach do you remember?
Speaker 2: She taught English.
Speaker 1: English and do you remember any specific advice that Ms. Beaman gave you?
Speaker 2: To not be afraid to go for your dreams and to not let whatever was surrounding me to dictate what I was going to do and she lived that and so I just always remember that about her because she took the time.  She was one of those teachers that made a difference that you never forget.  So I've been trying to find her on Facebook, LinkedIn and everything.
Speaker 1: Well good luck with that.  So your school obviously was integrated and in a very nice portion of town and a couple of blocks from where you lived.
Speaker 2: Still in the Upper West Side [New York, New York].
Story_ID: 42339
Speaker 1: Upper West Side [New York City, New York] and how many black were at the school during this time, we are talking about the '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: We are talking about '65 [1965] to '68 [1968].  Probably a third, you know, it was a turbulent time but I never felt--the one thing I can say about myself aside from my experiences in terms of being with black students, white students, my early years of education I never felt blatant racism.  I only focused on it when I went south which is interesting to me.  When I was in the South I would like my friends say yes ma'am, no sir and when I went back to New York [New York City, New York] and I'd say yes ma'am my mother [Irene hill] would say don't say that, I don't want you to say that under any circumstances.  So it was like two worlds that I lived in.  So in school in my earlier years I didn't feel the integration that was going on.  All of the kinds of things that other young women and men my age were experiencing in the south, I was living in Manhattan [New York City, New York].  And while there are racists there, now and certainly then my mother really shielded me from that.
Story_ID: 42340
Speaker 1: And your elementary school as well as your high school [Louis D. Brandeis High School, New York City, New York] were always integrated.  Your neighborhood was integrated, okay.  When you were in high school and during those times that we would say were turbulent, do you recall reading, hearing, knowing about what was going on across the country?
Speaker 2: Absolutely because remember my best friend who is my best friend now, Susan Grant lived on 112th Street in Harlem [New York City, New York] between 7th and 8th and I would go and stay with her so my life wasn't void or ignorant of what was going on because I was up in Harlem.  My church--I was originally baptized as Abyssinian Baptist Church so I lived that life in terms of knowing what it was but it did not directly affect me in school.  I did not have students who didn't want me to sit next to them.  I didn't have that experience but I certainly understood and was very sensitive to the fact that it was happening elsewhere.  I would get on the bus as early as age twelve; my mother would let me ride by myself.  I would get on the No. 7 bus on the corner of my house and ride up to church every Sunday.  I sang in the choir, in the youth choir at Abyssinian when Adam Clayton Powell was there.  So I was a part of this I just didn't have someone next to me saying you can't sit here or you can't come in this way.  I didn't experience that but I lived that generation and the problems.
Story_ID: 42341
Speaker 1: Do you recall interacting with Adam Clayton Powell?
Speaker 2: As a small girl I remember going to church [Abyssinian Baptist Church, Harlem, New York City] sometimes with my mother [Irene Hill] and we would see him, I remember that and talking to him, I do remember that.  But I don't have any vivid stories that I could share relative to that but I do remember it.  I remember going to choir practice and sometimes we would see him.
Speaker 1: And he was the pastor at that time?
Speaker 2: Yes he was the pastor at that time.
Speaker 1: And he was in politics at that time?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the sermons, were they fiery sometimes and talking about integration and the struggle and the stuff that was going on in other parts of the country?
Speaker 2: Well you know the black church always brings something about what is going on with our culture so it was always something that was in the sermon every Sunday that brought the reality to the forefront of the times that we were living in.  I am certainly rooted in the black church very, very, very much rooted in the black church and the black experience.  I just had the good fortune of being able to have a life that part of the year I was in it in the South and the rest of the part--the rest of the year I was out of that.  When I would be in Memphis [Tennessee] and would get on the bus with my relatives and go to the back that would be for three months but then I would be in New York [New York] and get in a cab or get on the subway or go to a restaurant or whatever with my mother and there was nothing like that.  But then I also would go up to Harlem [New York, New York] where there was chicken and waffles and all of these things and be richly served, if you will, with our black culture and our black experience.  I was a young girl who was in a cotillion and you may recall that the cotillion was supposed to be the coming out.  And all of that was still part of the black experience, you know.  So I've had all of those kinds of experiences and they have made me who I am.
Story_ID: 42342
Speaker 1: I would like to hear more about the cotillion.  Who hosted it and who sponsored it do you recall the organization?
Speaker 2: I don't remember who sponsored it and I didn't bring the book because I was one little chubby child and that book.
Speaker 1: How old were you?
Speaker 2: Oh God, I had to be sixteen.  I remember the white dress and the crown on our head.  I remember the rehearsals where you were on the arm and you would step and you would step back and then you would walk around and then you would step (laugh) I remember all of that.  It was just lovely and I mean it was like a movie if you will.  I was a cotillion girl.
Speaker 1: And this was a black event?
Speaker 2: Absolutely black, absolutely black, it was the coming out of young girls in black society, I guess.
Story_ID: 42343
Speaker 1: Now in high school [Louis D. Brandeis High School, New York City, New York] do you recall any extracurricular activities that you might have been involved in?
Speaker 2: In high school I was involved in the writing club because I loved to write and I loved to read.  We had a reading club back then we would talk about all the different books that we were reading in our English classes and authors that we loved and our goals to be writers because most of us wanted to be writers or journalist on some level.  I remember all of that.  I remember that we would leave at lunchtime and go around the corner and have pizza-New York pizza and we would fold the pizza and the olive oil would run down our arms (laugh), you know those are the things that I remember.  The clubs and the times we would sit and have pizza and Pepsi or something and talk about the papers that we just wrote, the grades that we had just gotten, the students, we thought we were doing well and the teachers that we loved.
Story_ID: 42344
Speaker 1: Now your first boyfriend.
Speaker 2: Oh my God my first boyfriend.
Speaker 1: How old were you, was he in class, where did you meet?
Speaker 2: My first boyfriend was on the basketball that I remember was on the basketball team, he was a basketball player at Brandeis High School [Louis D. Brandeis High School, New York City, New York] and he lived in Harlem [New York City, New York] on Edgewater in one of these unique brownstones because in New York we call them brownstones.  In Chicago [Illinois] they call them white stones and different places they call them whatever.  His name was Eddie and he was on the basketball team and I just loved him.  His mother--he lived with his grandmother and his grandmother and my mother became very close and he and I dated for a couple of years.
Speaker 1: Now did your mother meet his grandmother after you all became friends?
Speaker 2: His grandmother and my mother met after we became friends because you know we were eighteen.  So we were seeing each other and they became friends then.
Speaker 1: And did that relationship move on beyond high school or--?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to think, it did, it moved on into the early years of college for me and then we just broke up in college.
Story_ID: 42345
Speaker 1: Now seems that you graduated from Brandeis [Louis D. Brandeis High School] 1968?
Speaker 2: I did from Brandeis High School.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about the years between when you graduated from high school and when you got your degree more than maybe eleven years later from Baruch College [The City University of New York, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: When I graduated from Brandeis I went to Manhattan Community College for two years.  I went from Manhattan Community College to Baruch College which is part of the City University of New York collection of schools.  During that time I was working, I always worked; I worked from when I was sixteen.
Speaker 1: Doing what kind of work?
Speaker 2: Secretarial work.  I typed very fast and so as soon as I could work I had my part time jobs and so when I was in college I went to work for the largest law firm in the nation and I worked in a steno pool.  Because I typed so fast, I ended up working for the senior partner of the whole firm.
Speaker 1: What is that firm, please?
Speaker 2: Cravath, Swaine & Moore and I worked for the senior partner who was an old gentleman who was wonderful and I was his private assistant and I was a paralegal because I thought I wanted to go to law school.  So I used to read all the time and they would allow me to work with them on briefs and all kinds of different things and so I was studying at Baruch at the same time that I was working.
Story_ID: 42346
Speaker 1: Then while I was working I decided that I wanted to go graduate school and that I wanted to study journalism and I applied for a scholarship to the University--I applied for several scholarships and I got accepted at Syracuse University [Syracuse, New York].  I got accepted at NYU [New York University, New York City, New York] but I got a special scholarship at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].  There were six of us that were known as the Booth scholars, full scholarship, full everything and I decided to go to UM [the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, Ann Arbor, Michigan] because I had relatives in Ann Arbor and so I left the law firm and I went to the University of Michigan.
Speaker 2: Now how long after high school--you had finished your degree at Baruch [Baruch College, the City University of New York, New York City, New York] and then you went to Michigan, okay.
Speaker 1: I was married in between there with my first husband.
Speaker 2: Okay somewhere in between high school and your leaving.
Speaker 1: Right, I was working and I was married and I was living in New Jersey near Princeton University [Princeton, New Jersey] and I was commuting every day into Wall Street because I worked on Wall Street.  And I actually worked in the Twin Towers which is a whole other story.
Story_ID: 42347
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your life between after high school on to college Baruch [Baruch College, City University of New York, New York City, New York] you were working part time at the law firm [Cravath, Swaine & Moore] as you mentioned but somewhere between you got married.
Speaker 2: Somewhere in between I got married.  Between working at the law firm and studying I met a man named Marvin Norman who was from Virginia.  I met him through some friends and we dated for about a year and then we got married.  We would go to Virginia to visit--his mother was in Virginia and he was a man who had been previously married.  He had three small daughters; they were three, four and six and they would spend summers with us and I just loved them, they were beautiful little girls.  He and I got married in New York [New York City, New York] but we moved to New Jersey because he was running a children's development center in New Brunswick, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Will you give me the dates for this?
Speaker 2: About, oh my, this was in 1972 that we got married and we got divorced three years later.  And during that time I was still working and studying and I was married to him and I was commuting every day to Wall Street [New York City, New York].  I would get on the bus that would bring us through the tunnel and I'd get on the subway and go down to Wall Street.
Speaker 1: And so you were married in New Jersey, working on Wall Street and going to college.
Speaker 2: Yes and then we got divorced and then I moved back to Manhattan and I lived down in the village [Greenwich Village, New York City, New York] which I loved the village of New York.  And I lived there and I used to work like a crazy person all day, work late at night for this law firm and we were in the Twin Towers [the World Trade Center].
Story_ID: 42348
Speaker 1: In the Twin Towers.  What was it like in the Twin Towers at that point?
Speaker 2: It was exciting, you know you get on and you push the button and you go to the 56th floor, just like that.  So it was wonderful.
Speaker 1: And where you worked you had a great view?
Speaker 2: I had a phenomenal, phenomenal view.  You know the offices were plush.  They were beautiful, they were new; it was exciting to work there.  Everyone was enamored with the buildings.  So you were proud to say I work in the Twin Towers because it was such a highlight of downtown Manhattan [New York City].  And this firm [Cravath, Swaine & Moore] had two floors so it was a huge firm.  I remember that I had never been in an office where you go up the floor and you had all the carpeting and it's like being in a house when you are going up the stairs and you're on the next floor.  I spent a lot of time in library researching briefs and working with the attorneys and it was a great time.
Speaker 1: Were you working full time or sometimes full time sometimes part time?
Speaker 2: I was working full time and part of the time I took some night courses so I did that because I was determined to get finished but I needed to work in the day time and I was really caught up with my job as well.  I was really getting into wanting to be a journalist and doing reading and writing and researching.  So I knew that I wanted to be a journalist.  First I thought I wanted to be an attorney but then I decided after I spent a year researching that that was not what I wanted to do.  I didn't want to be a first year attorney always researching.  And so I started watching different anchors on television and I thought I could do that. You know, I could do that.
Story_ID: 42349
Speaker 1: Who do you recall watching?
Speaker 2: Carol Martin who is now a very good of mine.  It's so weird to know people now that you watched and admired back then.  Carol Martin was the darling of CBS in New York [New York City, New York] the number one station and the number one anchor.  I watched her; I remember writing her a letter because I always wanted to be where the people who I admired were.  So I went when I was working at the law firm [Cravath, Swaine & Moore] I went through a friend of my mother's and obtain an internship at NBC in New York.  And I remember them saying to me, and I was doing all this; I always liked to multi task.  I've learned how to multi task way back when and I work best when I do that so I was always doing a variety of things.  So the law firm allowed me to do this internship that I wanted to do while I was in New York because I wanted to see what is it really like, what does it feel like to work in this environment.  And so I would go two afternoons a week and I would be dressed up and I remember them saying we'd never seen an intern that's dressed so well and I explained well I also work.  I'm in school in the night which is how I could take this internship because you have to credit for your internships.  They said you're just amazing; you are doing all these different things.  But I would watch when I would go there--I worked in the newsroom for my internship so I was able to be in all the excitement of news and sit and watch the anchors and I said that's what I want to do.
Speaker 1: Was it a paid internship?
Speaker 2: No, it was for credit only.
Speaker 1: Do you feel like it was worth it?
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely because after that I ended up being on television for a year.
Speaker 1: In New York?
Speaker 2: No in Ohio.
Story_ID: 42350
Speaker 1: Before we get to that I wanted to ask about what you were studying at college [Baruch College, City University of New York, New York City, New York].  Were you were studying journalism in college?
Speaker 2: I was studying English.
Speaker 1: English in college?
Speaker 2: I was studying English and I was studying some journalism, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay and you got your degree in what year, 1979 maybe?
Speaker 2: From Baruch.
Speaker 1: From Baruch, oh we are talking Baruch.  But you continued at the law firm.
Speaker 2: I always worked, I always worked.
Speaker 1: Did the internship come after you got your degree or while you were still in college?
Speaker 2: While I was still in college.  So I was literally interning because the law firm allowed me to do that.  And sometimes I would go to intern and then I'd come back to work, work late nights.  I worked many mornings and then I'd go and I'd do my internship and I'd come back and work in the evenings.
Speaker 1: And where were you living at this point in your life again?
Speaker 2: I was living down in the village [Greenwich Village] in New York [New York City, New York].
Speaker 1: In the village in New York and you had your own apartment?
Speaker 2: I had my own apartment and everything, yes.
Story_ID: 42351
Speaker 1: So at some point you left New York City [New York] and you had to leave that beloved law firm [Cravath, Swaine & Moore] but before that can you just tell me maybe a couple of things that you feel like that set you on your life's path that you may have learned at the law firm from the people that you worked with there?
Speaker 2: At the law firm I learned strategic planning and being organized and multi-tasking and to delve deeper.  Because I had got so involved in research, I really learned the benefit of going beyond what's just in front of you because we had to research a lot of different things obviously.  I learned my writing skills went to an entirely different level at the law firm because I was always writing.  I was always transcribing something.  I was always analyzing something and so my really--I think the foremost memory that I would have in terms of learning something there would be really the importance of researching and writing explicitly and clearly and comprehensively.  That in law you have to be comprehensive you can't--television you say something in ten seconds but in law when you are writing something it has to be--it really has to speak volumes and be volumes basically and I learned that there.
Speaker 1: Are there a couple of people that might have been a great influence or your positive influence at the law firm?
Speaker 2: Yes, there was a woman who I worked for a while.  She was one of the associates that worked under the senior partner that I worked for and her name was Edna Kuhn.  She did children's law and so we used to--we would have all these interesting stories that we would talk about of cases that she was working on.  I certainly remember her very well because she had two daughters and I remember admiring her back then as a woman who worked so hard because it was so many men, she was one of three women in that firm on that level at that time.  And I remember admiring her and she was really one of the first women who I felt inspired me to just be different and to go for.
Speaker 1: Was she a partner?
Speaker 2: No she was a senior associate.
Speaker 1: A senior associate and this senior partner that you worked for what was his name?
Speaker 2: His name (laugh) his name was Christopher.  I know his name was not on any of the documents but his name--no his name was Chambers, Mr. Chambers; tall, distinguished, white hair, phenomenal sense of humor, very proud walk; he was an interesting man because he used to give me his bills but not all of his bills.  He'd give me maybe three or four special bills and I remember that once he had a bill that was for Bloomingdale's and they had charged him a late fee of ten dollars which he challenged and I remember sitting with him, listening to him talk to them about why he should not be paying this ten dollars.  And I now will ask for a supervisor in a minute, I will challenge ten dollars--anything that I think is unjustified.  I will challenge it I don't care if I'm in a restaurant or I'm in the White House whatever it is I'm going to challenge it.  If I think that it's unjustified and I'm sure that I got that from him.
Speaker 1: Mr. Chambers.
Speaker 2: Yes, Mr. Chambers.
Story_ID: 42352
Speaker 1: Now how did you feel about leaving the law firm [Cravath, Swaine & Moore] when you did eventually leave?
Speaker 2: The law firm it was bittersweet for me because there are a number of things that happened while I was there in addition to meeting these amazing people.  There were a lot of things that they did for me that were life changing for me.  My original birth certificate said Valerie Hall--Valerie Denise Hall even though my father's name was Greene.  After I met my father [Edmund Greene] I changed my name legally and they did that for me.  And my father once I met him, he was very happy that I did but that was a very moving and memorable experience for me that they did that for me.  They supported my interest in going into journalism professionally and they taught me a lot so it was very bittersweet for me to leave but I felt like it was a new season and it was time to go.
Speaker 1: Time to go and when did you go, when did you get that first journalism job?
Speaker 2: I left in 1979 to go the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].  To be one of the Booth Scholars and I moved everything lock, stock and barrel.  I remember my friend saying you are going to graduate and it's just two years.  Because I knew then that I was leaving New York [New York City, New York] and that was really difficult for me but I just felt like I wanted to move my life on into my next career.  So I had all my furniture sent to Ann Arbor [Michigan] and I had an apartment off campus.
Story_ID: 42353
Speaker 1: But as you were leaving New York do you recall what was going on in the city culturally, were you aware of Essence [Magazine], or Black Enterprise [Magazine] or Percy Sutton or those kinds of things because you were a young woman in your twenties so do you recall any of that--what was going on in black culture?
Speaker 2: I absolutely recall Percy Sutton there's no question because the radio was where we got information not that we weren't watching television obviously and the news a different type of information because radio has always been a conduit for young black men and women to connect culturally through music because music has always been the common thread.  So I remember going to the Apollo [the Apollo Theater, New York City, New York], okay I was always going to the Apollo.
Speaker 1: Who do you recall seeing there?
Speaker 2: Oh my goodness, I remember seeing Martha Reeves and the Vandellas, I remember the Temptations, I remember I loved the Temptations when they were doing all their--oh God.  I remember seeing Jackie Wilson, the Apollo was just oh a wonderful experience.  I remember standing in line looking at the big names up on the marquee.  I remember Stevie Wonder standing there saying I'm getting ready to see Stevie Wonder, you know on the marquee and going into the Apollo and standing up and dancing and doing all the stuff that we did.  I remember before I left I remember Teddy Pendergrass and the radio stations talking about how the women were throwing their panties and everything on stage.  I remember him being on Ed Sullivan; I remember all of these things before I left.  I remember Martin Luther King and how we used to sit in school and I'm just remembering all of this now, sit and talk about the march, you know, how Martin Luther King was fighting for-just for us to have the right to do the things that we do today.  To go in the front door and not the back door; to sit at the counter and not have to eat outside.  I remember us having spirited conversations as young budding journalists and writers about all of that.  So I remember, definitely remember that.
Story_ID: 42354
Speaker 1: I want to back track just for a moment because you mentioned Dr. Martin Luther King [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and I know you have family connections in Memphis [Tennessee].  Were you familiar with Larraine Hotel [sic Lorraine Motel]?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, I was familiar the Larraine Hotel.
Speaker 1: And where were you when he was assassinated?
Speaker 2: I was in New York [New York City, New York], I was not in Memphis.
Speaker 1: You recall that?
Speaker 2: And I recall my mother [Irene Hall] getting on the phone and calling to Memphis and my grandmother [Verma Clair] answering the phone just crying, just crying.  I could hear in the background that not only she crying but I could hear my great grandmother [Mary Lee Armstrong] because my great grandfather had passed and my great grandmother was just devastated beyond anything I could imagine.  Because she was born in the 1800s so I remember that; I remember that being so surreal, you know, that was something.
Story_ID: 42355
Speaker 1: So when you went to the college you went to again.
Speaker 2: I went to Manhattan Community College [New York City, New York] first then I went to Baruch College which is part of City University [City University of New York, New York City, New York] and then I went to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] on a full scholarship in journalism.
Speaker 1: To get a Masters.
Speaker 2: Um hmmm in broadcast journalism and in television; I got a double.
Speaker 1: How long were you there at the University of Michigan?
Speaker 2: I was there actually a year and a half because while I was there I went to a career conference in Washington [D.C.] that I had read about that was for African Americans students.  And there was a woman seated there who I connected with.  It was a long, long line and I thought I can't get in this line but I wanted to meet her, she was the assistant program director for the NBC affiliate there and she was seated there and I saw this line and I stood and I looked at her and we just kind of connected and she said come here.  It was a God moment; I've had several of them in my life.  And so she said I saw you looking at the line, she said for some reason I wanted to talk to you.  What's your name and I told her my name was Valerie Greene because that's what I said my name was then.  I didn't say Norman, I said Valerie Greene and she said I really want to talk to you and I said I want to talk with you also and so she said meet back here at 5:00 and I did.  She and I went and we sat and talked.
Speaker 1: So was the line to talk to her?
Speaker 2: The line was all the way--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: And she saw you and said--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: I was standing and she saw me.  Honest to God that's how that happened and we got together and she actually is the reason that I got into television in the way that I did because a couple of months later she was contacted, her name is Cindy Walker; it was Cindy Walker then.  She was offered a job in Youngstown, Ohio at a station called TV 33, WYTV 33 in Youngstown, Ohio.  And she became the first black program director in the history of television and she went to Youngstown [Ohio].
Story_ID: 42356
Speaker 1: Do you remember what year-about what period this was?
Speaker 2: This was '78 [1978].
Speaker 1: Because she made history, okay.
Speaker 2: This was 1978, I'm pretty sure because I came to Chicago [Illinois] in '77 [1977] or '78 [1978], somewhere around there.  She called me because now we were communicating and she [Cindy Walker] said I'd like to put you on television.  I'm still in school; I'm trying to get my Masters so I said I'm not going to be finished for another six months.  And she said I want you to go and talk to your advisor because I would like to bring you here.  She and I had been talking because we had this connection so we had been talking over the couple of months before she got this job and then talking when she got it.  Well anyway, long story short, I went to my advisor who really was a TV guy.  My advisor and my professor and I said I really want to be in television because in this group of Booth scholars we were part of obviously a big class of journalism students.  We would go and we would travel to newspapers and we'd write newspaper articles and all of that.  Out of the whole group there was just a small portion of that group that wanted to be television journalists, electronic journalists opposed to print journalists.  And this particular professor was a former TV journalist so he really had a kinship for us.  And so when I went to him and told him the story that she wanted me to come and do this he worked it out where I could go and do that and write a paper about it for my last six months and they allowed me to go to Youngstown [Ohio] to work.  So then I became a co-host of Good Morning Youngstown with a man named Anthony who was an actor and he and I were on television together for eleven months.
Story_ID: 42357
Speaker 1: Now nine months into those eleven that I was there Cindy [Walker] was offered the job of program director at WBBM television here in Chicago [Illinois].  So WBBM moved her here and two months later she brought me to Chicago and that's how I came to Chicago.  When I came here she wanted me to be on air; I didn't want to be on air anymore.
Speaker 2: And why not?
Speaker 1: Well my experience over the eleven months was very interesting.  It was rewarding, I met a lot of interesting people but it was really an infringement on my personal life.  And I had two incidents that I can think of that made me think, "I don't know that I want to do this."  While I loved it the personal side of my life was more important to me.  One day I was out with some girlfriends who had come to visit me in Youngstown [Ohio] and we were just out with girlfriends having a good time and some people ran up to me and they wanted my autograph, they wanted this that and the other and it kind of ruined my day with my girlfriends.  Because now instead of me being Val, I now was Valerie Norman--Valerie Greene Norman because on the air I added the Norman and I will tell you that story in a minute, not just Val to my girlfriends.  Then I had a another situation where I used to wear soft contacts lenses that were the cellophane type and I was taking my makeup off one night and I forgot I had them in and one of them rolled up like saran wrap to the top of my eyelid.  It took me an hour before I realized that I could not get it out but meanwhile I had my hair in rollers, you know.  I had my pajamas on and I went and threw on some jeans, was walking out the door to go to the emergency room and realized my hair was in rollers and I would have to take those out, comb my hair, change my clothes in order for me to go to the hospital because they would recognize me and I couldn't look like that.  So I decided then that I did not want to be on air that I wanted to be in charge and I knew that being charge meant being a producer and executive producer.  I said the next move for me is going to be on that level.  So when Cindy said I'm going to bring you to Chicago because I said to her I only came to Youngstown because you were so I know you are not leaving here; she said no I'm not; let me go there and she brought me here.  She wanted me to be on air and I said no I want to be in charge; I want to be a producer.  And so I became the producer of 'Common Ground' and I worked with Warner Saunders for a minute and then I worked with Renee Ferguson.  Then three months later Lee Phillip had a show and her producer left.
Story_ID: 42358
Speaker 1: I'm sorry before you go to Lee Phillip tell me about 'Common Ground' and working with Renee [Ferguson] and Harry Porterfield.
Speaker 2: 'Common Ground' was--you mean Warner Saunders.
Speaker 1: Oh Warner Saunders.
Speaker 2: Warner was there when I first came and then he left and Renee is who I really spent the most time with.  'Common Ground' was an interesting experience and my life at WBBM [-TV] was interesting because I was the only African American woman at WBBM.  1979 I came here in September of 1979, packed up my little car, drove from Youngstown [Ohio] and was driving on the "S" curve that was here in Chicago trying to find my way to the hotel, the Allerton Hotel which is down the street from [W]BBM.  'Common Ground'--when I told Cindy [Walker] that I didn't want to be on air she gave me 'Common Ground.'  This was the time when Harold Washington was not mayor yet and because of the nature of 'Common Ground' two hours, late night, no holds barred, unplugged kind of show I met some of the most interesting people and produced some of the most interesting segments of my career.  I met all of the community leaders.  That's when I met Jesse Jackson, I met Harold Washington; I met just a ton of people here.  But I also met some real interesting characters.  I met this guy whose name escapes me who was a pimp and is now friends with many major music stars.  I can't even remember his name but oh my God we did all kinds of shows.  We did political shows, we did--everything was controversial because you had two hours.
Speaker 1: Two hours once a week?
Speaker 2: Two hours once a week.
Speaker 1: And you interviewed the guy you described as a pimp on the show?
Speaker 2: Yes, what is his name?  I cannot think of his name but I'm going to think of his name.  Oh what is his name but he had on a green suit and all kinds of stuff and we had shows about being a pimp, we all kinds of shows.  We had shows where people walked out of the studio because they were angry.  Because, you know, you are interviewing for a very long time.  You had a lot of segments so you could really delve into that so all of my training, my journalistic training, my legal training to go deeper and deeper and deeper came to fruition and was utilized when I was producing 'Common Ground.'  So that was an interesting time to say the least.
Speaker 1: And Renee was hosting?
Speaker 2: Renee was-Renee Ferguson was hosting that and we would leave there and go into the office and did you see that, did you hear that, can you believe that; just phenomenal.  Two months after I came here and again I was the only African American female and there was one other woman who was a friend of mine.  A young white woman who was working on another show; she was the economics reporter named Judy.  She and I bonded as the only women but when Bruce Dumont who was producing Lee Phillip's show left that was a prime slot and Cindy gave it to me.  So for six years I produced two shows, I was the only producer with two programs on WBBM but what it did because Lee Phillips was highbrow and 'Common Ground' was community I met everybody.
Story_ID: 42359
Speaker 1: I came to Chicago in September of 1981 over the Labor Day weekend.  I drove my little car through the "S" curve and found my way to the hotel and then realized that CBS WBBM was actually two blocks down and so I would just walk down there to work.  I came here during a time when Bill Curtis was here and Walter Jacobsen.  WBBM was number one for everything for everything so it was exciting to be here and be a part of that whole collection and group of people; winning awards like crazy and everything.  When I--after I worked on 'Common Ground' for so many months and then the 'Lee Phillip Show' became available because Bruce Dumont left. Cindy Walker made the decision to give me the show which then gave me two shows, 'Common Ground' and Lee Phillip.  And the Lee Phillip show was really a prize possession.  There were many other producers who wanted to have her show but I got it.  It was a lot of work but I loved it.  I was reading all the time because I had a two hour show in 'Common Ground' where you had to have a lot of material and you had to really delve into what was going on in the city and the community.  But then I also had Lee Phillip who had a half hour day time Sunday magazine show with three segments that had all the biggest names in entertainment that came to town.  So I was always going to plays, I was always going to big entertainment events, I always going to celebrity parties, I was always going to everything that was very high brow for her show and very community and local for 'Common Ground.'  So I met everybody.  I was being interviewed, I got numerous awards because I was everywhere doing everything and it was crazy but I loved it, I absolutely loved it.  My relationship with Lee Phillip [Bell]--I did not know who she was obviously before I came here.  I was unaware of the fact that she was married to Bill Bell and that she actually was Lee Phillip Bell and that they owned 'The Young and Restless' and also 'The Bold and the Beautiful.'  So I didn't know that they were a powerhouse couple living over on Lake Shore Drive and that every afternoon Bill was on a conference call with his LA [Los Angeles, California] team executive producing 'The Young and the Restless.'  I had no idea until I met her and we started working together and she and I actually shared a huge office.  So we would look each other every day.  We became very close.  I remember she invited me to dinner one night and I went over there.  She lived in one of the apartments, I've forgotten the actual address but it looks out on the lake, beautiful entire floor.  And her daughter was there and her sons who now are big stars in television and we just had a good family time.  Because they were just regular, family oriented people and it was phenomenal, it was just phenomenal.
Speaker 2: Now you mentioned that her sons are now big names in television.
Speaker 1: Her daughter is Lauralee Bell who is on 'The Bold and the Beautiful' and her sons have been working in the business so they are something.  The father, Bill Bell has passed on but recently Lee ran into someone, a mutual friend and she called me to say hello.  So she is out in LA now doing her thing and they say that--she says that she is over there a couple of times a week.
Speaker 2: On the set?
Speaker 1: On the set that's amazing, that's wonderful.
Story_ID: 42360
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned you were--you interviewed a lot of entertainers coming through and got a chance to meet them, any names come to mind from that period when you were producing that show that you might have met?
Speaker 2: Michael Jordan on the sport side, all the top sports figures we met.  Oh goodness so many movie stars because they were in town for plays and they would come on--oh God I can't, I'm just trying to think.  I'd have to think about that for a minute but everybody; everybody who came to town was on our show.
Speaker 1: And then you also mentioned community, what was going on in Chicago [Illinois] in politics during this time was it Jane Byrne, Bilandic was that happening then?
Speaker 2: Jane Byrne was the mayor, Harold Washington--during this time there was a lot going on.
Speaker 1: There was.
Speaker 2: There is no question in Chicago politically.  Jane Byrne was the mayor, Harold Washington and Ed Vrdolyak and that whole scene with those two groups they were making front page every day; lead stories every day, fighting every day.  And the African American community was up in arms every day, you know, relative to all of the stuff that was going on which of course lead to Harold Washington ultimately becoming mayor which for me was a life changing experience because in New York [New York city, New York] we were not--politics was not an everyday discussion in New York City.  In New York City it's climbing the corporate ladder, its' about finances, it's other things.  In Chicago it was about politics and I'd not had that experience so when I came here just by simple coincidence, I would constantly run into someone whether it was Harold Washington or it was Jesse [Jackson] or it was another commissioner in a restaurant or whatever and find myself engaged in a political conversation.  Because that's what everybody was talking about and as a journalist and the African American producer at the number one station with two shows I was constantly in conversation.  Conversation that I sought out and conversation that sought me so it was very interesting.
Story_ID: 42361
Speaker 1: And when you mentioned that you were sought out as well and of course all the players, media players, political players they knew who you were.  They knew that you were connected; they knew that you could get them on one if not both of these shows.  So how did you feel about that because obviously you were very well respected and loved and in great demand but then there were people who wanted to play you as well?
Speaker 2: I felt that I had to walk a very thin line.  I had to be very cautious because legally, certainly when there were political races going on, you know, equal time all of that I had to be very sensitive to.  As a matter of fact, at one point I did have a concern that I voiced to my superiors about the fact that I was trying to stay as focused as possible, as balanced as possible but that I wanted them understand that I was going to have one of the other sides, I won't say which one be a little bit more present because I felt like I had been partial to one side over the other.  And that I knew that professionally that I needed to watch that.  I felt that I needed to be very sensitive to the needs of the community and both voices.  And sometimes that was very difficult because as an African American I was excited about Harold Washington, you know.  Just enamored--who could not be?--enamored with the momentum and excited about the momentum that he had created here.  But as a journalist and as a professional I needed to still tell his story and tell his opponent's story.  So I felt challenged sometimes by that but I think I did a good job with it.  Outside of politics yes everybody wanted to be on our shows and people were constantly sending me books; every author in the nation.  I had so many books in my office because everybody wanted to get on there so I was constantly reading.  But I felt empowered and I felt a responsibility, great responsibility to be balanced and to be informative in ways that I had not been before to multiple audiences.  So it was an interesting time for me.
Story_ID: 42362
Speaker 1: Now I know well that the media business can be stressful.  Did you find it stressful, how did you handle that, did you exercise, did you get your rest; how did you take care of yourself?
Speaker 2: I laid out in the sun; I would relax and try to read something that did not have to do with work.  And then sometimes I didn't want to read at all so I would just in the warmer months I would go and lay out on my deck and just listen to some music, jazz music which I love, I would listen to spa music anything to just kind of take me away from all of the material that I had to constantly absorb.  Because I did feel stressed.  Every Sunday after church I would go home and I would have newspapers and books everything spread out all over my bed.  So I felt like I did not have a day where I could just be without my job because I had two shows; two weekly shows which is very different when you have to really bone up on material like that.
Story_ID: 42363
Speaker 1: Now what about your personal life, your friends.  Who were some of your friends during this time and of course I know that Cindy Walker that you mentioned was a mentor and a friend. Who were some friends in your life then who still may be?
Speaker 2: Well the first friend who is still a very good friend of mine was Renee, Renee Ferguson.  The first day I came to work Cindy called Renee Ferguson to come down and to meet me and we bonded then and we're really great friends; she's one of my best friends and Lamont Neal.  Lamont is one of the senior account execs at CBS.  He handles network and he was there and he--that same day I met him.  But I also became great friends with Dwayne Kyles who is still a friend of mine today.  Merri Dee who is still a friend of mine today, I mean all these people are still great friends of mine who I admire.  Linda Johnson embraced me; I went to her parties and all the different things.  Juanita and Michael Jordan, interestingly enough, were not married when I first came here but we later became friends.  We saw each other in Hawaii and just kind of bonded after that, we were great friends.  Just so many different people, Warner Saunders, Art Norman, you know, certainly people in my profession gravitated towards me and when Oprah Winfrey came here I befriended her first and the reason that I did that is because so many people befriended me when I came here and I knew what it was like to come from someplace else and not know anyone.  So I called her and introduced myself said you know this is who I am, this is where I'm from.  I'm over at your competitor but I have experienced exactly what you are experiencing now so let me help you with a couple of things.  I gave her dentists, I gave her hairstylists, I gave her gynecologists (laugh), I gave her a number of people and she and I became friends.  We created what we call the big sister/little sister group and we got together with this group every Saturday.  There were girls from Cabrini Green and Oprah and I along with some of her staff would get together, go over there and get our little sisters and spend the day with them.  We did that for a long time.  Actually when she and I see each other now she'll say do you ever hear from them, no I don't talk to them and neither does she because that was so long ago and we have lost contact.  We did that probably for about six months until she got busier and I got busier and we kind of kept in contact with them but that's one of the things that we know about each other that is something we did in history before she was the Oprah that we know and before I left Chicago [Illinois].
Story_ID: 42364
Speaker 1: And at that point she was not well renowned Oprah but she had the local show?
Speaker 2: She had the AM Chicago Show and she was just meeting people.  Abe Thompson is like a brother to me and so she met Abe during that time, she met a couple of other people that I knew that I introduced her to because these were friends of mine, real friends of mine.  And I felt like they would be friends of hers regardless of what fame she might obtain there.  Of course, nobody knew she was going to obtain what she did but we are all happy for her, obviously.  During the years when she moved from the half hour show to the hour show I left WBBM and started my own company but she and I still remained friends.  That first year when I left, I actually co-authored a book with a guy named Terry Mason, Dr. Terry Mason, who's here, who is another one of my best friends and we wrote this book.  And the reason why we wrote this book was because I wrote an article in Today's Chicago Woman about a subject that Terry is an expert in which has to do with impotence.  And I wrote a story about it from a female perspective because he had a part of a clinic that he was running that focused--discussed impotence with women and I sat in on that and I decided to write an article about it.  It was in Today's Chicago Woman and they called me after the third largest publisher called them and asked them if they could connect us.  They called me to write the book, I said I needed to write it with Terry and in my first year when I left WBBM I wrote this book.
Story_ID: 42365
Speaker 1: At the end of that first year Renee Ferguson and Ken Smikle her husband introduced me to Terry Williams who was Vice President of public relations for Essence Magazine.  Essence was doing an event called the Essence Awards which was a dinner and they had done it in one city in Los Angeles [Callifornia] and the dinner was designed to do two things, to honor women African American women achievements but to also be a place where they had advertising offices and it would create a marketing venue for them, a marketing opportunity.  So they were coming to Chicago [Illinois] and they wanted to do another dinner and he introduced me.  So I said to them--.
Speaker 2: This would be the second Essence Dinner Awards?
Speaker 1: I said to them I don't do dinners.  I don't, if we can't go to TV we have to go to the stage.  So they said what do you have in mind?  I wrote up something and I said I think Oprah Winfrey should host it.  This was continuing my relationship with O [Oprah Winfrey] and then beginning my relationship with Essence and I said I think that she should and we ultimately did the first one that was not a dinner so this was Essence Awards number two at the Chicago Theater and O hosted it.  It was a phenomenal, phenomenal evening.  Oh God we had so many stars at that.  Jessie [Jackson] was in it, Ashford and Simpson was in it, oh it was just a litany of people and O hosted it.  The night before we did that we had big event for women at Isabel Neal's gallery and Isabel was showcasing a woman named Artis Lane (ph. splg.) so we connected all of the black women in celebrating the Essence Awards with the host, with myself, with Essence, with Isabel, with the gallery, with everything and it was phenomenal.  We--and that happened in Chicago.  We then went to Atlanta [Georgia] for the next one and did it in Atlanta and then I wrote a television treatment and we went to Radio City Music Hall [New York City, New York] and after that we took it to CBS primetime network television and I executive produced it.
Speaker 2: So you really were in on the beginning of that.  They had only had a dinner before and then you became involved and it turned into the Chicago event and I was there.
Speaker 1: And it was incredible.
Speaker 2: It was incredible.  I was there and remember the reception and it was a great show.  What was going on behind the scenes at that Chicago [Illinois] show because you were back there calling the shots?  I don't know if I even saw you that night if so--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Probably not because you know I'm in the zone when I'm working.  My friends don't even talk to me when I'm working (laugh).  Because I'm so myopic, because excellence is the standard and that's all I can focus on.  There was the excitement that Oprah [Winfrey] was hosting it, there was the excitement that there had never been anything in Chicago like this, there was the excitement that the names that were associated with it in addition to her were women who came from all different walks of life.  There was the excitement that Susan Taylor was here from Essence Magazine, there was the excitement that people would see when they came into the theater this big replica of this Essence Award that was a crystal piece with the emblem of Essence in it shaped like a pyramid and I had a huge set piece of that done and that this emblem would fly and the awardees would walk through it.  There was all of that going on for those us who knew this.  We were excited that you would see it when you got there and those that attended were excited that all of these people were in Chicago.  It was really, really special and I was just proud number one to be in the company of so many wonderful women and number two to be creating something that was a first for this city and it was just special.
Story_ID: 42366
Speaker 1: One thing I remember about that night and I remember a reception more than anything because Mr. [John H.] Johnson was there.  Even I, you know, with Ebony and Essence and they were rivals even back then, of course, I was invited and I came but Mr. Johnson was there as well and I remember my baby sister who was still a teenager then.  But there were all of these phenomenal people so before we go any further I have two questions to ask.  Now you were saying everybody was excited that Oprah [Winfrey] was there.  So where was she in her career at that point, was she nationally syndicated then or was she still a local entity?  I know she was a star.
Speaker 2: She was absolutely a star and she had just become nationally syndicated.  I'm just visualizing it; she had become nationally syndicated and just at the very beginning though.  But she was a star; people knew who she was beyond just the local community.  So it was really very exciting for people to be in her company and she was excited to be there.
Speaker 1: Now along the same lines, I remember Mr. Johnson being there, had you met him previously?  Because already you were--he was a part of your life or your career.
Speaker 2: I did know Mr. Johnson.  I was very proud to know him because Linda [Johnson] had embraced me when I first came here and I had been up to meet him and we had talked about a variety of different things and I just thought he was a wonderful man, obviously with a great history.  It was great to see him, I knew he would be there but it was great to see him there.  Because it is always wonderful to have history makers involved in something when you're making history.  So it was fabulous.
Story_ID: 42367
Speaker 1: And while we are still on this part of your career and you still being in Chicago [Illinois] what about some of the other local renowned people who were in the entertainment world in Chicago itself?  Ramsey Lewis did you know him?
Speaker 2: I did know Ramsey. I certainly knew Ramsey.  Ramsey was on the Lee Phillip show; everyone who was renowned in this city and nationally was on that show.  Because it was a half hour show so if you--Ramsey was on, he had a new album coming out, he was on--he and his wife.  So yes, I certainly--I did know him.  I knew many of the people-- just all of them, frankly.
Speaker 1: How about someone like Cocoa Taylor was she on the scene?
Speaker 2: Cocoa Taylor was on the scene.  Cocoa Taylor we actually had on 'Common Ground.'  Because we had an extensive discussion about the blues and the history and famous people and we actually had her on 'Common Ground.'
Speaker 1: How about Buddy Guy?
Speaker 2: We did not have Buddy Guy on not when I was doing it.  I think they had Buddy Guy on before but not when I was doing it.
Speaker 1: How about Lou Palmer, do you remember him?
Speaker 2: I remember Lou Palmer, how could you have 'Common Ground' and not have Lou Palmer stirring something.  Lou Palmer was incredible, Lou Palmer was always about pushing the envelope and so I loved him, I loved talking with him.  I loved his passion for whatever it was that he was trying to get for us.  I loved and admired his passion because I always felt that with the 'Common Ground' show when you had issues and you had people on that everyone didn't love, some love to hate them you still had to respect them for their opinions.  You still had to give them a voice and you had to respect that voice.  So I had a lot of opportunities to meet some interesting people.
Speaker 1: And what about Vernon Jarrett did you know him back during this time?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I did know Vernon, I loved Vernon.  Oh my God, just a consummate journalist, a great man, a great parent, father; really interesting conversations with him around the time that Harold Washington was running for mayor.  We had some very interesting conversations about the realities of what was happening right then and what could be and how that could change the complexion of this city.  I had those kinds of conversations with Vernon.  And another person that I was very fond of and spent a lot of time with was Max Robinson.  Max and I were very good friends.  Actually he and Renee and who else was with us-- John from CBS.
Speaker 1: John Rodgers?
Speaker 2: No not John Rodgers.  John Davis and I would get together.  Max Robinson, Renee, John Davis and I would get together late at night and have dinner and then go down to this little club that's no longer here the name of which I cannot remember and we would close it.
Story_ID: 42368
Speaker 1: Before we go back to your being a producer with the Essence [Awards] Show had you started your company Amethyst [Entertainment, Inc.] before you did the first Essence event?
Speaker 2: No I started my company VGN Enterprises.  That was the name of my company and that was the name that I produced the shows under.  The original one here in Chicago [Illinois], the one in Atlanta [Georgia], the one that we did in New York [New York City, New York] which was the biggest show with the eight women in entertainment and then when I wrote the television treatment then I started really moving in a different level.
Speaker 1: And you saw the production evolve, I would assume from your first one in Chicago, obviously that was very good.  Then you moved to Atlanta and none of these dinners, right?
Speaker 2: No all of these were stage.  In Atlanta we were at a major venue and in New York we were at Radio City Music Hall.  It was the first time they had gone obviously to Radio City Music Hall and it was a huge production because everything was just Radio City.  So, you know at Radio City everything is huge.  So we started to work with a group of set designers and all kinds of fabulous stuff and all the beauty editors of Essence and the wardrobe people at Essence and all that stuff because I wanted all of it to be just over the top and the big orchestras and all of that we did once we went to Radio City.  So when I wrote the initial treatment for a television special, it had all of that in it and it of course, had everybody.
Speaker 1: That was my question, when was it first done for television?
Speaker 2: It was done for television for the fourth year. I'd have to back up on that.
Speaker 1: Radio City Music Hall was that done for television?
Speaker 2: No, Radio City Music Hall was the year before we did television.  The next year we went to Madison Square Garden and it was done at Madison Square Garden the first year for television.  And then we flipped flopped, we do Madison Square Garden and then we would do Radio City; we do Madison Square Garden and we'd do Radio City.  I produced it and then the last two years of it I executive produced it.  So I really was the producer for ten straight years.  I created the stage and TV project for Essence Communications and then I executive produced it for those ten years.
Speaker 1: And the ten years of broadcast or counting the ones before that ten years of broadcast?
Speaker 2: No the year before that I did three years of stage and I did seven years for broadcast.
Story_ID: 42369
Speaker 1: And I know that you mentioned that Terry Williams was your initial connection to Essence and she got you involved.
Speaker 2: Terry Williams and a young woman named Karen Thomas.  Karen Thomas was the head of marketing.  The Essence Awards idea was Karen's idea, initially.  That was her brainchild and she is one of my best friends today.  And she and Terry flew in to meet me because Ken Smikle had told them about me and he introduced us.  That's how I ended up with that deal.  He made that introduction for us because he is very close to Terry Williams.
Speaker 1: And you met Susan Taylor at a later point?
Speaker 2: Susan came in after they decided they wanted to hire me.  We decided that it wasn't going to be a dinner because I didn't want to do a dinner.  I just felt like we could take it to the stage.  Then Susan came in and met me and she and I spent some incredible times together talking and shopping together and just doing all kinds of things.  She is just a phenomenal woman and I would like to say that the Essence Awards and the Essence Music Festival and we'll talk about that in a minute, have been some of the highlights of her career because she absolutely help shaped both of those.
Story_ID: 42370
Speaker 1: Okay.  That is what I wanted to know.  And you met Ed Lewis and Clarence Smith along the way somewhere?
Speaker 2: Definitely, once--what happened was once we really settled on the fact that it would not be a dinner that they were changing it then they all wanted to meet me, who is talking about this and what is she talking about.  What's going to happen here and so they all came in and then we all met and we talked about it.  Because remember if you were going from a dinner to the stage, it now provided other business opportunities that a dinner did not.  So Ed and Clarence were part of that discussion.  The marketing team was a part of that discussion.  There were so many other elements and then as we--once we got into New York [New York City, New York] then it just took it to another level, of course, once we got to television it became something different.  And the thing about television and Essence is although we taped it in New York, we produced it in Los Angeles [California] so I spent a quarter of the year in Los Angeles working on the Essence Awards because the production team was out there.  It was not in New York.  So I would leave my family and my friends and my church which I was very much involved in Chicago [Illinois] my church and go and spend a good amount of time out there.  Because there was a production company that Essence hired that worked with network television and that Fox was familiar with.  Because--let me just say this, the initial deal was with CBS primetime network.  This has always been a primetime two hour show.  Fox made us an offer we couldn't refuse in year three.  So we moved from CBS to Fox and the Fox team had a company that they liked working with and Essence retained them and we all worked together.  But I had to go and stay there because I'm representing Essence, I created the show and so now the whole new team grew the show together.  And so I'd have to go out there and work.  I had an apartment out there, I stayed out there, it was crazy and I did that for seven years.
Speaker 1: And during this part of your life you were single?
Speaker 2: Yes I was single and I was also working on some other things.  Essence was just one thing I was working on.
Story_ID: 42371
Speaker 1: And that is one thing I want to get to.  A couple of things that I know about that you worked on that were very significant.  You did a series of music festivals in the Caribbean.  You worked with various departments of tourism.  Tell me about the first one that you did and how that relationship was established and then the others that succeeded that and I was in Cancun [Mexico].
Speaker 2: We have to start with Cancun there is no question, we have to start with Cancun.  Cancun came about because I was on a girlfriend's trip and I was on the beach and I was on this trip because my girlfriends forced me to go because they said I was working too hard and I wouldn't take any time off.  We had planned a prior trip and I had to cancel, so they cancelled everything.  They said no we are going and you're going.  So we went to Cancun and we are on the beach and I have a habit of talking to people everywhere.  It's just you know, I'm very extroverted and I like to meet people and so this happened and I was talking with people so I said I'll be back,  I have to go and use the restroom and they were looking at me, okay you need to be back.  We will give you fifteen minutes.  So I go and I'm coming through the bar of this hotel and there were these two people there, a woman and a man and I spoke to them and they said hi are you visiting because they are in tourism, okay they were the heads of the tourism office.  I didn't know that but of course they saw me as a tourist, I'm walking around in my bathing suit.  Hi are you enjoying yourself?  Well I'm having a great time, this is a wonderful place.  It was the first time I'd been there and blah, blah, blah.  They said really you got a minute, sit down.  I sat down so for an hour I'm talking to them and the next thing I know one of my girlfriends is coming looking for me.  By that time I've already talked about how I'm just so fascinated with Cancun.  This was the beginning of their development along the beach.  They had peppered it with fabulous hotels so I don't know, by the time I got up I had convinced them that they should have some future dialog with me about bringing a major event there.  Exchanged cards the whole bit, I go back onto the beach my girlfriends like you can't go anywhere without starting something, you can't go anywhere.  And that's really how this started.  Two weeks later I was back in Cancun in a meeting, the whole presentation about what I called the Cancun Jazz Festival and my ability to bring thousands of people there who love music, who love to travel and who would embrace this new destination and I would bring BET [Black Entertainment Television].  And one thing lead to another and we did this big deal and I did an additional deal where I actually created the original office of special events and trained all of their people on how to do special events for a destination and the importance of bridging and combining entertainment and events for more tourism.  And so I did all of that simultaneously.  We brought 25,000 people to Cancun for the first Cancun Jazz Festival.  I owned everything, from the t-shirts to the stage; I owned everything.  It was a phenomenal business decision.
Story_ID: 42372
Speaker 1: Would it be correct to say you got rich?
Speaker 2: I would say that I certainly made a million dollars from that, I certainly did.  I owned every single thing and by virtue of that then they wanted to talk about doing other things.  And around that same time I met someone who introduced me to some people at William Mars Agency and the William Mars Agency became my agents for a couple of years.  I had two different agents; I had one that dealt with international things and I had one that dealt exclusively with television.  And so through them and through my relationship with tourism in Cancun [Mexico] I ended up meeting one of the vice presidents in Mexico City [Mexico] who flew us there and wanted me to do a similar kind of thing all throughout Mexico.  So I had a pretty extensive relationship with the country of Mexico.  I next did the Acapulco Music Festival and I continued to consult them and that was the beginning of this whole thing.  I never really thought that I wanted to do events as much as I was a television journalist so when I did the event it had to be something that was going to be taped for television.  I didn't want to just do an event because I didn't see it as small, I don't do small, I'm not being condescending I just don't see it like that, that's not my gift.  My gift is in mega things and so when you are doing mega and you can also bring television to mega whatever it is, that's what I wanted to do and that's what I did.
Speaker 1: Now can you mention some of the other festivals that you did, Virgin Islands, St. Martin's [Antilles]?
Speaker 2: I did, oh goodness, I did the St. Croix [U.S. Virgin Islands], the original St. Croix Music Festival for them.  I took my team in because by now I have the VGN Enterprises and we have a team that does those events.  Not the Essence team, this is a different team that works for me.  I had a full time staff with an office on Michigan Avenue overlooking Grant Park and we would go. Michael Scott was in my group who I loved dearly.  Everywhere I went I had Mike with me, I had Abe Thompson with me, I had a brother named Phil Fisher with me, I had Sharon Morgan with me and we would travel.  I would call them one day and I'd say we got to be in Mexico for a meeting day after tomorrow.  Pick me up at 4:00 a.m.; we are on the 6:00 a.m. flight.  I've got everybody's tickets, boom we're gone.  And we would be just like that over in a country having meetings.  Dwayne Kyles (ph. splg,) was an attorney and all so I had a team and we did some phenomenal things.  So we went into St. Croix, we then went into St. Martin and I originally went into St. Martin on personal business, you know just loving it.
Story_ID: 42373
Speaker 1: I originally went into St. Martin [Antilles] on some personal business and then ultimately I ended up doing some business with them consulting them on the value of entertainment partnered with tourism, you know and how it grow that industry for them.  During the years when I did all these other festivals I would bring people like Sinbad or stars like Najee and all of these big stars that I would take with me from festival to festival and I would partner with radio stations around the nation and they would broadcast live from my events which is why I have so many friends in radio.  And Sinbad asked me several years ago if I would train his family because his business is a family business.  If I would train them on the business of creating an event and teaching them individually and collectively how to do a major special event because he wanted to do a music festival and he had a deal with HBO [Home Box Office].  So I said that I would so we all traveled to different islands and said to him, you know we really need to go to St. Martin because St. Martin is beautiful.  I have relationships with the tourism people there, we can do this deal.  We went there, we did this deal and in seven months we brought so many people.  We ran an air lift just like I did in Cancun.  Had to have chartered planes and everything and we did a HBO special and I co-produced the HBO special but I created and produced the entire seven day festival.
Speaker 2: For Sinbad?
Speaker 1: Sinbad's Soul Music Festival which was 1995, I think.
Speaker 2: That is a significant accomplishment, not just his festival but that you broke new ground into the Caribbean and Mexico to bring this kind of entertainment.
Speaker 1: And you know something, I want to say that one of the things that I'm most proud of is the fact that with all due respect to everyone who is in the festival business now and in the special events business I really with the help of an enormous group of people really pioneered that with the Cancun Jazz Festival, you know.  I did and I'm just proud of the fact that I was able to do that and that a lot of African Americans were a part of that history with me in developing it and making it available to others around the world to have that experience, that's like none other.  That first one was just incredible.
Story_ID: 42374
Speaker 1: And I'm so glad that you pointed out that you pioneered it.  That is my perception, I wanted to clarify that and I think you definitely should take the credit for it because you rightfully deserve it.  I never heard of anything like that until that particular festival.  I'd like to switch up a little bit and I know you mentioned your church but I also was blessed to be a part of the Christmas Glory, the first year and succeeding years when you produced that.  Now how did that come about?  Were you a member of Apostolic [Apostolic Church of God, Chicago, Illinois]?  But also tell me about that, your relationship with Bishop Brazier because he was a very special person; if you could give us a little overview of that.
Speaker 2: I loved Bishop Brazier.  When I first came to Chicago [Illinois] I was looking for a church and one day on 'Common Ground' I met a woman named Sasha Dolton who is a great friend of mine, great friend of mine.  She was a guest and she said to me, you just got here, oh girl you got to come over for some greens and for this and this, that and the other and you looking for a church, I know exactly where to take you.  Now before she took me to Apostolic I had visited a couple of other churches and I enjoyed them but I didn't feel like that was the church for me.  There were two churches and I just didn't feel like that was for me.  When Sasha took me to Apostolic I immediately knew that that was my church home.  She took me in to meet Bishop and I was working at CBS then.  This was in 1982 that I first met Bishop Brazier and I knew that was where I was supposed to be and he and I would get together for lunch and talk and laugh.  It was as if God had just made us for that moment in our lives, in his life and in mine.  Two people that had never known each other but really had a connection that we knew really came from God.  We were very clear on that.  And so I had said to him that I wanted to serve because that was part of who I was and who I am.  And I was sitting in the congregation, the old church at the time, one day and the light bulb went off and God spoke to me and said he needs to be on television, he needs to be on television.  Now here Bishop Brazier is very unpretentious, name isn't on nothing except some letterhead.  No vans, no nothing and I'm talking about him being on television.  I'm trying to put this man on television.  So we got together for lunch, we would always go--he loved fabulous restaurants and I did and he and I would sit and we would enjoy each other and I said--I talked to him about it and he said no (laugh), no not me, no he was saying.  And I said I just want you to think about it, you know.  I just want you to think about it because you have what we call presence and presence is that you have the ability to actually be present right where we are; where every time you're preaching we feel like you are just preaching to us and you have the ability to be all encompassing and inclusive in a very calm, ordinary way.  You don't even realize that.  And so I just want you to think about it, he's like umm hmm, yeah okay.
Story_ID: 42375
Speaker 1: So I went back and Sasha had introduced me to two associate pastors who were great friends of mine and we started to pray.  We prayed for a year; an entire year that God would touch Bishop's heart for him to consider being on television or at least be on radio.  And I continued, you know, he and I would get together and we would talk about different things, what's going on with the church what his dreams are in ministry, his life which was so rich.  Just, oh God he was just such an amazing man, an important man in my life.  One day I was talking with him and I said if you don't want to go on television let's do this first and he agreed to go on radio.  And I said I would like to be able to not only do that but to create a ministry that focuses on who you are and what you think God wants you to do.  And we came up with the idea of the saving grace ministries.  Because Bishop's calling card to many of us was the saving grace of God.  I said we need to call this saving grace ministries and we did.  We started the radio ministry, he eventually allowed me to at least begin the conversation about television and to tape him.  We had the bookstore, we had the marketing ministry, we had the print ministry, we had the special events ministry, we had the radio ministry, we had seven ministries and I became the director over the seven ministries.  I had 240 volunteers and I had about six people who worked full time and I didn't work full time.  I had an office there but that's the volume of work that God had given us.  Meanwhile, Bishop had gone to the board to tell them about me and they are like who is this girl, she is not even from Chicago [Illinois], she hasn't been in the church, this is Apostolic, this is Pentecostal, she comes from a Baptist church, what's happening with Bishop.  Something must be going on with him.  He's talking about she wants a $100,000 to buy some cameras.  Now you know $100,000 is nothing, she wants a $100,000 to go on television and we're not even on the side of a van, what is going on?  He presented it to them, he had me come in and meet them, and I told them this is what I think.  This is what we can do with this money.  I will ask colleagues of mine, who I know, love God and respect Bishop at CBS to come in and help me train our people.  I came back and I asked Ron Vasser (ph. splg.) at CBS to help me, I asked a number of people.  I asked Myrna Herndon (ph. splg.) who was a producer with me to come in and help me and we went in and trained our staff and our crew and we had state of the art everything and built a control room just like the one in CBS which was now at the Apostolic Church of God, incredible.
Speaker 2: Were you there when they built the new sanctuary?
Speaker 1: Oh I was there for all of it.
Speaker 2: So you were there for the transition?
Speaker 1: I was there for twenty three years.  I turned down several jobs in Los Angeles because I felt that my work was here in Chicago and if I could go to Los Angeles for four months out of the year and make the kind of money I was making that I was to stay here because I didn't need to work twelve months to make that kind of money.  God has blessed me in four months to make it.  And I needed to back here working over at the church with all of this other work that was really what was important and so I stayed here.  It was a Christmas concert that I said this needs to be bigger than this and I worked for Essence on stage with the biggest names in entertainment; I can bring some of them to 63rd and Kenwood and Dorchester.  And I know there are some who would come at Christmas who love God who people don't realize love God because they are listening to them sing another genre but I know that they've got a gospel album or they have a Christmas album and that was kind of the birthing, if you will, of the idea of Christmas Glory that's where that came from.  And so we started doing Christmas Glory and the people started lining up around the corner to get in because Bishop never charged a dime.
Story_ID: 42376
Speaker 1: Tell us what is Christmas Glory?
Speaker 2: Christmas Glory is an event that is taped for television that honors the reason for this season with a ninety piece symphony and music from Christmas and music from the gospel genre that is taped for two and half hours and edited to a one hour special.  And it aired on Fox WFLD here [Chicago, Illinois], Robin Robinson hosted it for us and ultimately we had corporate sponsors that came to us and wanted to be a part of it because they supported the community which by the way is how I met Michelle Obama.  Which is why she and I know each other because for six years the University of Chicago Hospitals was a major sponsor.
Speaker 1: And she was that connection to--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: She was that connection.  She would come in, she would do--we had interviews for like what we are doing here with the principals of our major sponsors.  They talked about the community or whatever and she would come in and we would see each other all the time.
Speaker 1: Are you still in touch with her?
Speaker 2: Somewhat to the extent possible, you know, what are you going to say?  But oh yeah, and if I see her we wave because we know each other.  It's like the Oprah [Winfrey] factor, you know people when and you have a special connection to them when and that never leaves.
Speaker 1: How long did you do the Christmas Glory?
Speaker 2: I did the Christmas Glory for sixteen years.
Speaker 1: Sixteen years.
Speaker 2: And I own all the footage.
Story_ID: 42377
Speaker 1: Did you ever get paid anything from the church [Apostolic Church of God]?
Speaker 2: I got paid from the church to be a consultant for them in I've forgotten what year, the last couple of years.  And I never wanted to be paid from the church and the Bishop insisted so I took a very, very small amount of money, very small amount of money.  And most of the time I took that money and bought something for the ministry.
Speaker 1: Bought something for the ministry?
Speaker 2: Yeah, something that we needed that I wanted us to have because I always wanted to do things that was kind of over the top.  They were not common things that you did in a church and the reasons that I felt that was we needed other things, supplies, cameras, whatever.  There were other things that we needed and I--and the reason that I did that was because I felt that based upon what I did professionally that there were people who were unsaved that would be attracted to what I do and that's what Christmas Glory did-people would come, we had Gladys Knight one year.  People came because they thought that Gladys Knight was going to sing 'Midnight Train to Georgia.'  I don't know why they thought that but because her fan base did but she came and she sang 'Oh Holy Night.'  Wynton Marsalis--so few people know that Wynton had three gospel albums because he is world renowned for jazz but I know that because I worked with Wynton for years.  So when he came his music was all gospel based.  Either Christmas songs or gospels songs and I just felt that my ministry, the saving grace ministries was for outreach.  It was not the ushers, it was not the baptism committee, it was to create projects whether it was video tapes or whatever to give to the outside for people to hear the gospel of Jesus and that's really what I was about and I'm still about.
Story_ID: 42378
Speaker 1: Now did you win some Emmys for the Christmas Glory?
Speaker 2: Yes, I actually won--well we won--I didn't personally win our director won an Emmy for Christmas Glory.  I won an Emmy on the Lee Phillip's Show and I won three image awards for the Essence Awards, NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] Image Awards.
Speaker 1: I definitely wanted to get that document.
Speaker 2: I'm so proud of that.  I'm so proud of the awards that I received; I'm so grateful and so appreciative of the people who helped me get there.
Story_ID: 42379
Speaker 1: Now I see here that also you received the National Emmy Award nomination for "The History of Rock n Roll" and you worked with Quincy Jones on that.  Tell me about your relationship with Quincy.
Speaker 2: The relationship with Quincy emanated from Susan Taylor's husband introducing me as a possible producer of a series that Quincy was doing.  The history of rock n roll was a project that he was doing with Time Life and Time Warner.  There were ten of us that were chosen and I was the only African American out of the ten to produce one of the series.  We traveled around, we interviewed everyone that you could ever think of and I did the one that was called the 'Soul Years.'  It was phenomenal and Quincy would meet with us in Los Angeles [California] and this ironically was the only year that I ended up having to spend eleven almost twelve months in Los Angeles because I was there for the Essence Awards and I was working on the Time/Warner project, The History of Rock N Roll so I had to stay there because we had meetings with Quincy, we met at his house, we met at his office, we met at the other senior VPs.  I mean it was just a very unique opportunity and I was proud to really be a part of that.  And our discussions about the soul years were really rich because we were talking about the Jackie--the Temptations, we were talking about Teddy, we were talking about Mary Wilson, we were talking about the Supremes, we were talking about Jackie Wilson, we were talking about everybody that came.  Stevie, we were talking Motown, we were talking about everyone and looking at clips endlessly and traveling the world interviewing people.  Smokey [Robinson]--I went to Smokey's house for this project.  I will never forget this and Smokey--we set up outside.  We went into Smokey's house which was beautiful and just--his coach house with all of his records and all of his accolades and everything.  We decided to interview him outside in a tall chair.  It was absolutely incredible.  We talked for hours, hours just the richness of his story.  I interviewed Gamble and Huff on the state of the Apollo, fabulous about the Philly days, you know and the Philadelphia sound.  All of this was part of that whole Quincy rock n roll kind of thing.  That project got me into the director's guild and the writer's guild and the producer's guild and I'm proud to say I get checks today from those, I'm grateful again.
Story_ID: 42380
Speaker 1: So Valerie in 1995 to 2002 you were a producer for the main stage of the Essence Music Festival?
Speaker 2: Yes, I am proud to say that I'm part of the team with Ed Lewis, Clarence Smith, Susan Taylor, Karen Taylor, and Terry Williams who created the actual Essence Music Festival.  We created the concept; we went around the country working on selecting the right venue.  We decided on New Orleans [Louisiana] because we could do two things at once.  Have the main stage and then have that second level with the four quadrant rooms.  We could have four different things going on.  We created that and I actually decided that the main stage should be more than just another concert venue and I loved the fact that Essence, to my knowledge today, with the Essence Music Festival is the only one that has an actual produced stage presence when the performers are not on.  And I created that for them and I created the designs for the quadrant rooms.  So I asked a set designer that worked with me at CBS to come in and to meet us in New Orleans in the first year and to create a backdrop that was Essence because Essence [Magazine] is first class, it's all about, you know, the significance and the admiration and respect for African American women.  And I didn't want us to just have a black curtain in the back.  We needed to have something that was first class and lovely.  So we did that, I brought her in and we created that and then we went around and created the themes for the different rooms and designed them so that they would like the blues or the disco ball hanging for the seventies or whatever.  And so I was responsible for designing and creating all of that.  Then I said to Clarence [Smith] and Ed [Lewis] and Susan [Taylor] that I thought there was money on the table that was being left by virtue of the fact that when we normally go to a concert they play some music between acts, right we'll be back, you know, and now we're back, you know, want to the stage so and so like in that little block; we should be something that's going to generate revenue.  So I created all of these little moments where a host could come on stage and interact with the audience and they could be sponsor driven and they could sell them.  So, since we've done that they now, in fact, have been able to increase the revenue for Essence in ways that we didn't start out in the first year.  So I'm very proud of that.
Story_ID: 42381
Speaker 1: Now somewhere along the way you met your husband and fell in love.  How did you meet Parker Gammon [husband]?
Speaker 2: I met Parker Gammon when I was in graduate school.  He and I have known each other, oh God; we're celebrating our sixteenth wedding anniversary in December.  We met in 1979 when I was at Ann Arbor and I met him through a family member who lived in Flint, Michigan.  And he and I fell in love way back then in 1979 and our lives just went different ways.  Cindy Walker offered me the job in Youngstown [Ohio], Parker was busy doing his thing in Flint and he had a young son who he wanted to stay with and be able to be a father to and so we were just two people who loved each other but we had different paths at that time.  And we stayed in touch, we were friends.  We had great admiration and respect for each other but we never thought we would be married, ever.  And then in 1995 a friend of mine told me that because Parker had gotten married told me that Parker was divorced and that he was in Los Angeles [California] and had been living there for a couple of years.  So I thought oh my God, you know, because I hadn't spoken to him at that point in like maybe a year and a half or two years.  We had just both been doing our own thing.  Eventually we talked, we had lunch and we started to date and a year after we started dating we got married.  And we had a private wedding, dinner party for 100 guests and it was lovely.
Speaker 1: And where was it?
Speaker 2: It was over at the Moulin Rouge Room at the Fairmont Hotel here in Chicago [Illinois].  We completely transformed the room; the ceilings, the sides, the floor, everything and we got married on December 28.  So we had a holiday, winter wonderland formal wedding.  Everybody was in formal tuxedos, gowns, it was incredible.
Speaker 1: So you had the wedding and the celebration--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Everything it was a private dinner party because I wanted to have a dinner party with my closet friends and family as if we were there but I wanted everyone to be formal and that's where we had it.  Because they have a little stage there and everyone--we had ten tables, I guess it was ten tables of ten, round tables and they were all different groups of people who knew each other and they watched us get married.  And then we had everything there.  It was an evening--it started at 6:00, I had two camera men.  So they talked about us as we walked--as they walked in--as people walked in they interviewed them.  And after we were married they interviewed them again, you know, what did you think of it.  I edited one hour and Parker sat with an editor and edited another hour or our collection of all of our friends and family at that event.
Speaker 1: Now was it difficult to narrow it down to one hundred people?
Speaker 2: It was extremely difficult, it was painful--it was actually very painful.  Because there were so many people, and you look at who is 101, oh my God the 101 person, you know I really want them to be there but it's just going to be crazy and so we had to do it and we did and our friends understood, I think.
Story_ID: 42382
Speaker 1: So what does Parker do for a living and how does that complement you and who you are?
Speaker 2: Parker is an advertising executive.  He sells advertising, he's in the media business as I am.  He moved to Chicago [Illinois], obviously.  He worked for the rock station here, he worked for the R&B stations, and he worked in advertising sales as a manager.  So he was a local sales manager for a couple of the stations here.  In Miami [Florida] which is where we live now, he was the head of advertising for the number one adult contemporary station in the nation.  A station called Lite FM.  And now as of January he had started his own company.  The company is called the Gammon Platinum Group and what he does is he partners major corporations with mega events like some of the ones that I do around the world and that's what he's doing with his company.  Because he has all those relationships, all the big companies and he has a wife that produced mega events so he's familiar with that.  So that's what he does, he does high level sponsorship and corporate partnerships.
Speaker 1: In advertising, okay.
Story_ID: 42383
Speaker 1: At some point you and Parker decided to move from Chicago [Illinois] because this was your base for the two of you.  Why did you decide to move to Miami?
Speaker 2: We decided that we wanted to move to Miami [Florida] and we did so four years ago.  Doesn't seem like four years but it was four years ago that we moved.  Because we had been feeling number one that we wanted to get away from the weather and I love Chicago and all of my friends are here and part of my family is here but we wanted to be in a more global environment.  Because some of the work that I'm doing now is really more global in nature than I had been doing in recent years but I had been doing it prior and I wanted to be in an environment where I could step more boldly into that and get back into doing some things that I loved.  And he wanted to do that as well and we just felt like Miami was the place.  We didn't want to go back to LA [Los Angeles, California] because we certainly visit there from time to time and work there from time to time but we wanted to go to Miami where we thought there is some hot stuff going and it's the gateway to the world and so that's where we wanted to be and we love it.
Speaker 1: And it is working out for you professionally and personally?
Speaker 2: It's working out wonderfully.  It's fabulous, we have some great friends, we have some great colleagues, we have some interesting projects that we are doing that are emanating from there and it's been a phenomenal move for us.  It's the right time, the right season for our lives.
Story_ID: 42384
Speaker 1: Now what was it like when you were on that first NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] Image Awards and that was for the Essence Festival?
Speaker 2: It was for the Essence Awards.
Speaker 1: Oh pardon me.
Speaker 2: The three NAACP awards that I have image awards are for the Essence Awards and you know it's really interesting because when you work on a collaboration you want everybody to be a recipient of all the hard work and I am very much a team player but when you are the recipient yourself of a prestigious award like that it is just amazing because the NAACP is certainly an organization that I love and highly respect.  And the award has meant so much to me because it's an award for work that I've done that has promoted our culture, has promoted the black women, has promoted the team spirit and most importantly exemplifies excellence.  So winning it the first time was like oh my God this is just incredible.  I have all three of them on my wall in my office.  People come in and they are like oh my God and I say oh my God, thank you God this is wonderful.  So it was just really great.  Then we won the second one and it's like okay God you're smiling and then the third one; I'm just really grateful, grateful.

Speaker 1: And what kinds of things are you doing now?  We know your historic moves from past projects and working with Essence on these two wonderful projects that you helped to evolve.  So what are you doing these days, in the last couple of years?
Speaker 2: These days I am doing several things.  Firstly, I am teaching which is something that I've been wanting to do for years.  I wanted to teach here at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois], never had the time was always so busy, just couldn't figure it out.  When I went to Miami I said to some people that I had met there that I really felt that it was a time for me to teach because I wanted to give back.  I've always been concerned about young people, I've always had them under my tutorage in some way and I wanted to teach about this profession.  So I am teaching, I'm teaching the business of the entertainment industry, I'm teaching the media relations, I'm teaching introduction to the art of film and I'm teaching public speaking.  I've just recently been asked--I'm teaching that in the business school at Johnson and Wales [Johnson and Wales University, Miami, Florida] and I'm going to be teaching at The University of Miami [Miami, Florida] very shortly in their J school [Journalism School] as well.  So I'm doing that and have been doing that the last two and a half years.  I started a mentorship--a media mentorship club with all of these honor students who are great students from around the world.  So I'm very proud about that.  We're getting ready to launch a university network on line that's going to be marvelous.  I also was recently appointed the executive in residence at Johnson and Wales and in that role I am consulting faculty as well as staff and students on this business that we call media and journalism because they are going to be creating a media and communications curriculum in 2014.  So I'm consulting them on that, working with them on that, inviting people to come in, colleagues of mine to speak at the school.  I recently had Kathy Hughes in because I submitted her name for an honorary doctorate which she did get so she was there.  So I'm really honored to be an executive in residence like a visiting professor but they call it executive in residence so I was that last year and I'll be that--have that position again this year.  In addition to that in this new world of higher education, I am consulting several tourism entities around the world on this business of entertainment and I'm also working with the international--what's called the Women's International Film Festival [Women's International Film and Arts Festival] that's going to be in March in Miami which is a phenomenal project.  I'm consulting them and will be overseeing all of their events which is a major event.  As a whole it's in its seventh year, the founder is an African American woman whose name is Yvonne McCormack-Lyons and you can go on line to the website for the Women's International Film Festival doing some incredible things.  And so I'm very excited about that.  And I'm also hosting an international event in St. Martin [Antilles], St. Barts [Caribbean], Anguilla [Caribbean] and St. Martin in June 2013 for 300 specially invited women from around the world that will be a business to business venture that will pull women from around the world towards each other and create business deals over a five day period.  So I'm pretty busy.
Speaker 1: And you're not thinking about retiring?
Speaker 2: Not now (laugh) not yet.
Story_ID: 42386
Speaker 1: Okay.  I wanted to ask about--go back to your mother [Irene Hall] again.  I know your mother passed some time ago.
Speaker 2: In 1973.
Speaker 1: In 1973 and she was how old at that time?
Speaker 2: My mother was sixty five and she had lung cancer and emphysema and she passed from that.  My father [Edmund Greene] passed as well and he had a heart attack actually on his boat and that's how he died.
Speaker 1: You said on his boat?
Speaker 2: On his boat.
Speaker 1: In the New York [New York City, New York] area or--?
Speaker 2: No he was in the Bahamas and I last saw him at the funeral.
Speaker 1: And your relationship continued to be good with your mother over years?
Speaker 2: My relationship was good my mother.  You know, daughters and mothers have strange relationships and we were certainly part of that scenario.  But we loved each other deeply; she was very proud of me and I was really proud of her and as I've gotten older I've understood her struggles, you know, and appreciated her even more for the things that she did for me and my younger brother who I grew up with whose name is Steven Robinson.  He is in Los Angeles [California].  And I loved her, I'm sorry that I didn't have more time with my father, get to know him even better but I did meet my older brother Eddie Greene, Jr. who lives here in Chicago [Illinois]at the funeral.  And so from that day on he and I have been very close now.  My step mother here in Chicago is a woman named Vera Collins who I happen to look a lot like and many people think she's my biological mother but I love her as well and I love my brother and they are still here and that's why in addition to my great friends I love to call Chicago home.
Story_ID: 42387
Speaker 1: So tell me about your brothers a little bit more.  What--do they have careers or did they have families?
Speaker 2: Well my younger brother [Steven Robinson] was an entrepreneur.  He had his own plumbing company.  He was like a blue collar kind of brother, you know, just worked hard.  Used to work when he was fourteen in the butcher shop in New York [New York City, New York] and so he is that kind of guy; he's just a no frills, just big hearted guy.
Speaker 1: In New York?
Speaker 2: In New York.  He now lives in Los Angeles [California]; he's lived there the last two years with his wife.   And his two kids are grown now.  My niece and my nephew still live here in Chicago [Illinois] because what happened was I brought them to Chicago after I came here from New York and we all went to the same church and everything.  So they resided here in Chicago for a long time.  My brother Eddie [Edmund Greene, Jr.]  lived in Los Angeles and when my step mother, Vera Collins took ill he came here and he runs the Collins Laundromat.  They had the Laundromat, they had the ribs joint, they had the supermarket, they had all of that.  They had the cleaners and now the Collins Laundromat is one of the businesses that my brother runs and so he is here; he is my older brother and Steve [Robinson] is my little brother who I grew up with.
Story_ID: 42388
Speaker 1: And you never had children?
Speaker 2: I never had children and I wanted to have children but my life was just moving along so quickly that it just never happened.  But I had two step sons, Parker [Gammon] has two sons from his first marriage and they are grown.  They live in Los Angeles [California] and we have a great relationship and one of them is in the business as an editor; works on a lot of the top shows there.  And the other one is finding himself like many young people are.
Speaker 1: Does the one who is in film editing does he ever do anything with you?
Speaker 2: Actually we are working on a project now, we're actually working on a project that I'm not at liberty to discuss but we are working on something.  But he works on BET projects; he is really a phenomenal editor.
Story_ID: 42389
Speaker 1: Do you have any regrets about your life?
Speaker 2: The only regret I have about my life is that I didn't have children.  That's the one regret that I have other than that, no God has been good to me, I have been blessed to know some people to have some God moments where people reached out to me and pulled me up to the next level and the next level and the next.  And so how can you regret something like that?  When God smiles upon and you sends you angels who cared enough about you to put their ego aside and to move you forward, so no I don't.  I still have much to do.
Story_ID: 42390
Speaker 1: I was about to ask do you feel like there are still some things to accomplish that you have not gotten around to yet?
Speaker 2: I feel there are many things that I still have to accomplish.  I feel that from a spiritual perspective that there is still work; that God always has work.  For me to have been here [Apostolic Church of God, Chicago, Illinois] with Bishop Brazier for two and a half decades almost, that is part of who I am.  So I now have a new church home in Miami with a young pastor and I feel like there certainly is work for me to do there.  I feel like there is work for me to do with young people and that's because this is the season of my life where I've gotten an entire education that there is definitely work for me to do there.  And I feel that there is work for me to do that will allow women especially to reach across the waters to come outside of their hoods, their cities, their states, their countries even and I feel like I am to be somewhat of a catalyst for that; to bring women of all walks of life and all cultures and all creeds together to do significant things.  Because I feel like we do that, we lead that charge with all due respect to men.  We do and I just feel that because I have always been a person who could bring people together in large numbers that this is something that I am now called to do as well and to do it globally.  So I feel like my work globally is still sitting there to be finished.
Story_ID: 42391
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as the woman who always wanted to cast a wider net; the woman who always saw the glass half full and not half empty and the woman who loved God first; that's how I want to be remembered.
Speaker 1: And we are almost near the end, what advice do you have for other young women in the media and entertainment; what advice do you have for them as to how they can have a fulfilling life and career?
Speaker 2: My advice to young women and young adults in terms of fulfilling their careers and having a rich life is to think outside of this and to look at this because the little box will only take you a little ways.  But you need to think outside of the big box and on a higher level and not let fear stop you from doing things that you should do because often fear which we all have at some point can keep us in a place that limits us in a way that can change our life.  Where if we would just embrace our fear and step forward and look at the bigger picture; we should always look at the bigger picture then our lives can be richer and that's what I would tell young people to look at the bigger picture, embrace the larger box, always think on a higher level and take that bold step.  Don't be afraid to leave your family and go somewhere and study, don't be afraid to leave your friends and go somewhere and take that job, don't be afraid to take the menial job when you can look at the big picture.  Okay because so many great people started in the mail room.  Don't be afraid; don't think that you are higher than you are at that point, just know that you will be there.  So embrace it all and do it, don't just talk about it just do it.  Because anything that anybody else can do you can do too.
Story_ID: 42392
Speaker 1: Now I know for a fact that many young people and your contemporaries admire you very much and for what you have been able to accomplish right before our eyes, who are some of the people especially women that you have admired over the years?
Speaker 2: Maya Angelou first after my mother [Irene Hall].  Let me just start with my mother, my grandmother [Verma Clair], my great grandmother [Mary Lee Armstrong].  Let's start there unequivocally.  Then Maya [Angelou] just her life story and her encouraging words and just the life she lives.  I admire Susan Taylor, I admire Michelle Obama; how can you not admire Michelle Obama.  Tremendously, I admire her on so many different levels.  I admire, I'm just thinking, I admire Cicely Tyson for being a pioneer, I admire oh goodness, Alice Walker for being a phenomenal writer, I admire oh goodness, I admire Halle Berry for breaking the barriers, getting the first Oscar.  I admire all these women who have brought something to the table that was not there before because they have paved the road and the way for me in so many different ways and on so many different levels.  So I admire all of them and those are just a few to be honest, just a few.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As I'm thinking of all the others.  I certainly have to say that in this group and I certainly don't want to leave her out I really admire Oprah Winfrey because Oprah came here just knowing her story, Oprah came here with one thing in mind and that was to make a difference and now she has taken this whole world to another level.  I mean on continents, in communities, in people's hoods, in their homes, inside of their hearts and everything and I admire her for that because she didn't do one thing, she didn't impact one person, she has impacted the world.  So I greatly admire her as well.
Story_ID: 42393
Speaker 1: Now is there anything that we haven't discussed that you feel that you want to share and be a part of your legacy; any little tidbit, incident, person.
Speaker 2: I'm thinking, I'm thinking.  It's going to take me a minute to think because it is so many different stories.  I think I would just want to say last but not least that it is so important to reach back and it is so important to pay forward and that we don't do enough of that and then when you think of the people who have struggled for us to be able to just sit here now in these lights, wearing decent clothing and eating decent food and traveling where you want to go and having the things that you want and being able to speak in front of a crowd of young people to have something to say to have impact on the future.  It's important for us to reach back and to pay forward.  So I would want to say that in my legacy that people would know that that important to me and it was important to me to say it to you that we should do that.  Because we didn't get here by ourselves and God blesses us all, he loves us all but there are angels he has put on this earth who are behind us that we need to bring forward and we need to always remember that because without that our ego has gotten completely out of whack and it is not about our ego; it's about what we can do for somebody else and that's how I really feel.
Story_ID: 42394
Speaker 1: Okay tell us about this.
Speaker 2: This is in Youngstown, Ohio.
Speaker 1: We have scanned so.

Oh my we're going to have to crop out the guy on the left because I can't remember his name.  He's from Fox but that is me and the awesome, funny and multi talented actor of television and everything else.
Speaker 1: I'm so bad with names.

You probably should crop out the guy on the left and the one on the right and begin with me on the left-that is me on the left like in the early 1980s with a weird hairdo, next to me is Wynton Marsalis, next to him is Nancy Wilson and next to her is Najee, the two gentlemen on the right are sponsors, I don't know who they are.  That is me as a little girl on Easter with my Easter basket and my bonnet and my dress and shoes and socks and no teeth in the middle.
Speaker 1: That's always a good look.
Speaker 2: That is me at a party--a going away party when I was leaving New York going to the University of Michigan in 1979.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes that's it for that.  Where is that picture of my father?  That other picture, I can't believe--(unclear).

Each of us owns a different level with our stuff on it.  It's a phenomenal piece.  You can take that out.
Speaker 1: That's okay we just need to know who it is.
Speaker 2: That is my beautiful mother, Irene Hall Robinson, you cut off her head.
Speaker 1: At about what age do you think?
Speaker 2: I would say she probably was in her twenties.
Speaker 1: Alright that's all of them.  Thanks a lot.
