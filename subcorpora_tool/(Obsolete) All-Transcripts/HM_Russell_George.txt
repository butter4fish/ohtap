Speaker 1: And if you recall, [HistoryMaker] Judge [George Russell], we did have a few People magazine-ish type questions that we started with the last time and we'll run through those again really quickly.

Story_ID: 217614
Speaker 1: Now if you would, [HistoryMaker] Judge [George Russell], please tell us a little bit about your mother, starting with her name and where she was born and where she grew up, how she grew up, that kind of thing.
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Anna Marie [Short] Russell.  And she was from Charles County, Maryland, La Plata [Maryland], and where she was born, and her, her mother [Mamie Short] was a pure Piscataway Indian [Native American].  And my mother done work with her aunt, and for families, for the Finney family.  The Finney family is a group of well-known and well renowned physicians in Baltimore City [Maryland], and they would travel with the family and cook and my mother would assist my aunt in doing that.  And then she came to Baltimore and met my father [George Russell, Sr.] and they were married and had eight children.
Speaker 1: And did she ever share any stories with you about what life was like in La Plata growing up before she went to work for the Finneys?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did to a great extent.  The, the primary thing was that the Indians intermarried with blacks and with whites.  And there was an expression, they called them We-Sorts or You-Sorts.  And--because they were all mixed.  And I shocked a judge from Charles County by telling him I was a We-Sort, and he wanted to know how in the world I knew anything about that.  And that he--I told him that my parents, my mother was from Charles County and was a--her mother was a Piscataway Indian.  And that we were mixed.  And then he understood it.  But my grandfather [Heber Short] was a farmer and I said he was a sexton at the church.  And was well-known in the county and the Shorts were well-respected.
Story_ID: 217615
Speaker 1: Do you know how your mother [Anna Marie Short Russell] and your father [George Russell, Sr.] met?
Speaker 2: I've forgotten where they met.  I know my father didn't let her get away.  But I don't remember.
Speaker 1: And how would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: Oh she was a wonderful, caring woman who went to Mass six o'clock every morning.  She was very religious and she was completely devoted to her children and her husband.  But both my father and mother believed that when you brought children into this life, that your--your life and your pleasures and your needs and desires are secondary to what the children need and desire.  And they were a tremendous example for us, all eight of us.  And that's the real basis that I live as a result of their teachings.
Speaker 1: And did your mother stop working for the Finney family once she met your father and married?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, and but Aunt Rebecca [ph.] and Aunt Cora [ph.] remained.  And it's very interesting, Aunt Rebecca died and she had over a quarter of a million dol- three quarters of a million dollars because the Finneys invested the money for them and they were buying stocks in, in Amoco Oil [Standard Oil of Indiana; BP Amoco] back in 1927, '28 [1928].  And they would--I talked to the Finneys, and they would review her portfolio.  And she decided to keep Amoco and some of the other stocks.  And it's a, a--both my aunts died very wealthy.
Speaker 1: And did your mother ever talk about just--did she ever share any stories with you about her travels with the Finneys?  Were there ever stories that come to mind in particular about her travels?  Did they travel all over the state [Maryland] or all over the country?
Speaker 2: Well in New England primarily the Finneys had a place there.  I don't know, maybe she did.  You know I had three older sisters.  And of course they were much closer to my mother than I was in the sense that I was always working or doing something, but she would relate stories to 'em--but none come to mind at the present time.
Speaker 1: Sure--
Story_ID: 217616
Speaker 1: --[HistoryMaker] Judge [George Russell], let's talk a little bit about your father, starting with his name and where he was born and how he grew up.
Speaker 2: My father's name is George L. Russell, Sr., and he was born in Baltimore [Maryland].  My grandfather was named Hezekiah Russell, who was also born in Baltimore.  So we're from a very old family in the City of Baltimore.  My father went to [Fanny Jackson] Coppin [Normal School; Coppin State University, Baltimore, Maryland].  He finished high school and he went to Coppin Normal School in those days, and he became a schoolteacher and he didn't like it.  And then he went into the [U.S.] post office, and--where he worked for fifty-five years.  And he was a supervisor.  And he worked what was known as the unknown mail.  Anything a, another clerk couldn't determine, they would send to him and he knew the city and the streets and the routes so well that he would decipher it.  And if he couldn't do it, then it couldn't be done.
Speaker 1: And so had he developed a reputation as like the--
Speaker 2: He was the Unknown Man, yes.  And I remember the bank that he borrowed money from to send us through college, they were so accustomed to seeing him coming in, that at the time when I was with him, they--all he had to do was just sign the note because he paid it off each time.  And they followed all of us, the banker did, and he was a source of pride for them and us with the discipline that he followed that his devotion to his children.
Speaker 1: And how would you describe your father?
Speaker 2: Well he's one, one in a million.  I mean he was, he was a Christian man and he was interestingly African Methodist Episcopal [A.M.E.], and my wife--my mother [Anna Marie Short Russell] was Catholic.  And they could not be married in the church, they had to be married in the vestry and then, and that--in the parish house.  And, and he--my father had to consent that all of the children would be Catholic.  And as a result, all of us became Catholics.  But he was a very faithful parishioner of Allen A.M.E. Church [Baltimore, Maryland].  Indeed, the whole Russell family was--grew up in Allen A.M.E. Church.  And my father was very dedicated to church.  His motto was "Church, home and school."  And he, and he was just a wonderful man.  And he demonstrated to me the kind of work and devotion that was required to really make it out here.  And he would always--his motto was, "Be somebody."  Just be somebody.
Story_ID: 217617
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Judge [George] Russell you mentioned a little bit about church.  Can you tell us a little bit about what your family's experiences were like in church?
Speaker 2: Well I don't know if I'm the one to describe it.  I went to Sunday school.  We, we didn't go to Ca- I didn't go to Catholic schools.  We went to public school.  But as a result, we had to go to Sunday school where the nuns taught us and would crack our knuckles and we had a very disciplined upbringing in that sense.  But we were a traditional Catholic family and that my mother [Anna Marie Short Russell] headed.  And my, my father [George Russell, Sr.] joined in.  But he never--he always remained a member of A.M.E., Allen A.M.E. Church [Baltimore, Maryland] because that was the history of the Russell family on his side.
Speaker 1: And do you remember like your first penance, your first communion, do you remember those occasions?
Speaker 2: The first Holy Communion, yes, and the communion.  We marched in a parade with the white suit and the red bow on your arm to show that you'd been confirmed.  And yes, I went through all of those experiences--
Story_ID: 217618
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Judge [George] Russell, how far back can you trace your ancestry?  You told us a little bit about your grandparents, but do you know if your parents [Anna Marie Short Russell and George Russell, Sr.] came from free people or slaves?  How far back can you trace your ancestry?
Speaker 2: I can't go--my grandfather lived to be, on my mother's side, Heber Short, he lived to be a hundred.  And I can't go beyond that.  And the same with my grandfather, paternal grandfather, Hezekiah [Russell].  We have records of his parents, but we haven't tried, at least I don't know beyond that.  But some of my, my cousin and my sisters have tried to get genealogy charts organized.  And they've been reasonably successful.  But we're from a long family in Baltimore [Maryland].
Speaker 1: Can you tell us a little bit about your grandparents, starting with your paternal grandparents and their names?
Speaker 2: Well my grandfather was named Hezekiah Russell, and they would call him Hez.  And they almost put that name on me, but instead I got Levi.  And my grandmother on my father's [George L. Russell, Sr.] side was Catherine [Ann Russell].  And they called her Katie [ph.].  My--I remember my grandfather because I would sit on his knee while my father shaved him every Saturday.  He would come to our home and he would sing the spiritual, 'Every Time I Feel the Spirit Moving in My Heart, I will Pray.'  And I grew up with that spiritual, and--because that's always sang at every Sunday, or Saturday.  And that is one of my favorite spirituals and at my father's funeral we sang it.  And I have it in to be sung at my funeral.
Speaker 1: And what can you tell us about your grandmother Katie?
Speaker 2: I didn't know her too well because she died when I was very young.  But the tales that I heard was that she was strict and a churchgoer, as was my grandfather.  And they were very close to the [Catholic] church and to the bishop, and there was a--I remember the bishop.  The--Monroe Davis [ph.] was his name, but they were close to my family.
Speaker 1: And what can you tell us about your maternal grandparents?
Speaker 2: My grand--my--I didn't know my grandmother [Mamie Short], but my grandfather, Short, he was Heber Short.
Speaker 1: Can you spell Heber for us?
Speaker 2: H-E-B-E-R.  He would visit and bring produce and things from the farm to us.  And my mother would make hot rolls and we had a wonderful time.  And he would visit with us and we all rejoiced.  And, but he lived to be, as I said, 101 years old, and it was--as healthy, he died in his sleep just as peacefully as he lived.
Story_ID: 217619
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Anna Marie Short Russell] do a lot of cooking growing up?  Was that--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --big in your family?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  She could cook, no question--she could bake cakes, she could do it all.  And for the eating at our house was a joy and she could make chicken salad like no other person could.  And my father [George Russell, Sr.] belonged to the postal alliance [National Alliance of Postal and Federal Employees (NAPFE)] and they would meet at each other's homes.  And they had a hundred percent attendance when my mother was there because she would bring out the chicken salad and the ham and the hot rolls and, and she could make chocolate cake, coconut cake.  That, that was the real joy in our family, was the cooking that my mother did.
Speaker 1: What was your favorite?
Speaker 2: Chocolate cake--
Story_ID: 217620
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Judge [George] Russell, tell me what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well I guess elementary school.  I can remember going to school [P.S.] 103 [Henry Highland Garnet Elementary School, Baltimore, Maryland].  In those days we wore knickers and I--I could never keep the knicker up on my right leg.  But that's the earliest memory, memory I have.  Although when I was young, I can remember when I was ill, when I was born my mother [Anna Marie Short Russell] said that they didn't know whether I was going to live because they had me wrapped in every--completely except for my eyes.  I forgot the problem that I had.  But I made it, you know, and it was through prayer I'm sure.  But the earliest I can go back is elementary school.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And can you give us the names of your siblings, including their birth order, the names of your siblings, their birth order, including yourself?
Speaker 1: The oldest sibling was Catherine [Marie Robinson], then Helen [Russell Quarles], [Merrian] Celestine [Russell Gibson], George [Russell] Jr., Louis Bernard Russell, [Mary] Elaine Russell, Phyllis Russell [Brown] and Charles Russell--
Story_ID: 217621
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Judge [George] Russell can you kind of describe your, your community for us growing up, your block or your street?  Do you remember that?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  Well we were in a middle class community.  On the deed to the property my father [George Russell, Sr.] purchased on Fremont Avenue, it has a clause in it that he couldn't move into it until two other colored families moved in.  He was the first in the block.  Baltimore [Maryland] was, and still is in many respects, a community of ethnic groups.  And there was a community in East Baltimore of blacks.  And we had the West Side and we had black people there, and then in South Baltimore.  But there were certain areas that you--territories--where you were confined to within the black community.  For instance, I lived at Fremont Avenue and no one from--would come into the area that didn't live there, didn't belong there.  And I can remember I went to see a girl in East Baltimore and the gang chased me all the way across town to West Baltimore until I crossed Pennsylvania Avenue and Dolphin [Street].  And when I crossed the street, they stopped because I was in my home territory.  And likewise even today, recently--I guess it was five years ago, they--someone asked me to serve on the Sandtown[-Winchester, Baltimore, Maryland] board of directors.  And I said, "They don't want me up in Sandtown, I'm not going up there."  But we were confined and the--it was a close community in the sense that people with occupations such as schoolteachers, postal workers, waiters, they were the real earners, earners of money.  And they were middle class.  And my father and mother [Anna Marie Short Russell] worked.  My father worked.  He not only sent us to college, but he sent, helped his sister Helen Woodland [ph.] to send her two boys to medical school and dental school.  There used to be a plan called the Morris Plan [Bank], and they borrowed the money.  And he would co-sign and he sent all of his nephews and children to college.  And they really and truly sacrificed in a Christ-like fashion that I wish I could emulate.
Story_ID: 217622
Speaker 1: And tell us a little bit about what holidays were like in your house [in Baltimore, Maryland].  Were they very festive times, and what were holidays like in your house growing up?
Speaker 2: Well Christmas was probably the most memorable.  Easter, because my mother [Anna Marie Short Russell] could cook.  And on Easter she would serve lamb and other kinds of meals at every holiday.  And because it was a big family, they had a big family across the street, the physician Dr. Hughes [ph.] lived over there.  And his son and I were, are still the best of friends.  And but generally the, the area was populated by people who were in the middle class, who, who had these government jobs and schoolteachers.  And that had earned income.  And the--on McCullough Street where Thurgood Marshall lived, I knew his family very well.  They, again, that block contained schoolteachers and postal workers, and it was a different neighborhood.  And, but you did not go outside of your neighborhood.  You were confined to it.
Speaker 1: Did you know Thurgood Marshall well?  Did you guys grow up together?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't grow up with him, but--
Speaker 1: No, but did you know him well, just from the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Yes.  When he was [U.S.] attorney general, he called me and handled the Marshall estate.  I said well how much money is in it?  He said, "Well it's not much," but the--I took care of it for him and the--his uncle Cy Marshall, taught us in school.  And the family were very close.  I argued a case before the [U.S.] Supreme Court when he was there on the bench.  And, and the argument--he would lean back and roar at me.  I had my parents, my mother, I mean mother and father [George Russell, Sr.], my wife [Marion Ann Russell] and son [George L. Russell, III] in the audience.  And the right leg, he made me so nervous, wouldn't stop jumping.  And then Chief Justice [Earl] Warren would ask me a softball question and I'd relax, and here comes Thurgood Marshall again.  And afterwards he told me to come back into chambers.  I said, "Mr. Justice," he said, "that's not what you're calling me, [HistoryMaker] George [Russell], I'm from Baltimore [Maryland]."  But he was a wonderful, wonderful, gregarious person.  And I was really proud to know him and to witness his tenure.
Story_ID: 217623
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Judge [George] Russell tell me what sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Hot rolls, pretty girls, see when I was young I was always hustling.  I always had a job or some kind of a hustle.  I used to sell ice and the truth is that the white man was selling ice in our neighborhoods, so I thought I would sell it.  I got a friend of mine named Leroy Carter [ph.], I'll never forget it, he had a wagon.  We would load up the ice and we told the people we'll give you twice the size of the white man's ice at half price.  And I said, "You know my father [George Russell, Sr.] and grandfather, why won't you buy the ice from me?"  Because my ice melted every day.  And he said well--he thought it and he said, "I think the white man's ice is colder."  And, but nevertheless we persevered.  And then, we began--we continued to sell ice.  But it was difficult.  But I always had a job.  And that's one thing my father embedded into me, to go out and work and earn what you need and keep working.
Story_ID: 217624
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about elementary school [P.S. 103; Henry Highland Garnet Elementary School, Baltimore, Maryland].  You mentioned briefly School No. 103.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What were your experiences like in elementary school?
Speaker 2: Well we--in those days we had good schools.  The teachers were wonderful and well-prepared because in the State of Maryland, they wouldn't permit the teachers to go to the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland], but they would give 'em a five thousand dollar scholarship, and they went to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and New York University [New York, New York].  So they were very qualified.  But more important, they knew all of us.  They were our neighbors.  So the principal of the school lived two doors from me.  And 103 was one of the premier schools in the city.  And most of the people who attended there came from well fam- well-off families or working families.  And it was a delightful experience.  The principal at one time called me 'cause I was going up the steps to the second floor, and I ignored her.  And she told my mother [Anna Marie Short Russell] that I had a hearing problem and my mother said, "There's nothing wrong with that boy, he's just hardheaded."  Nevertheless, they brought in a specialist and taught me lip reading for three years.  And so I became an expert in that.  I don't usually tell people that, but it has been very helpful.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a nice card to have in your pocket.
Speaker 2: But my mother just said how stubborn I was and I, and I went through it and I'm glad I did.  But the point is that the principal, or any of the teachers, would discipline us, call home and would discipline us again, my father [George Russell, Sr.] would.  And my father never missed a Parent-Teacher Association meeting for all of us.  And he was on time and he stayed there and he inquired.  He didn't--my sisters were very, very bright.  My older sister [Catherine Robinson] was a, was the first librarian.  Not the first, the second one, but she ultimately became the head librarian for the United States Army Europe.  Her husband was a colonel in the Army.  And my sister Helen [Russell Quarles] was chairman of the mathematics department at [Paul Laurence] Dunbar High School [Baltimore, Maryland].  My sister [Merrian] Celestine [Russell Gibson] was the first Spanish major from Morgan State University [Baltimore, Maryland].  And then I, I went to Lincoln University [Lincoln University, Pennsylvania] and the University of Maryland law school [University of Maryland School of Law; University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law, Baltimore, Maryland].  My brother [Louis Bernard Russell] next to me went to Hampton [Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia].  And then [Mary] Elaine [Russell] was the first dental hygienist, black dental hygienist in the State of Maryland.  Phyllis [Russell Brown] was a schoolteacher and Charles [Russell] went to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] and he was a clinical lab technician.  So that we all had opportunity to succeed in life.
Story_ID: 217625
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of your teachers from elementary school [P.S. 103; Henry Highland Garnet Elementary School, Baltimore, Maryland]?  Like did you have a favorite teacher?
Speaker 2: Oh pretty Ms. Quill, yes.  She is Mrs. Victorine [Q.] Adams, she was Victorine Quill then.  And she later married Willie Adams [William L. Adams] who became--who later became my client.  But Mrs. Wooten [ph.], Mrs. Watts [ph.], I remember all of them, yes.
Speaker 1: And tell me a little bit about what type of student you were during the elementary school years.
Speaker 2: I was average.  I, I always did enough to--about a C or a B, maybe a B student.  But things came easy to me in the, in the courses, and I enjoyed school, I enjoyed the teachers.
Speaker 1: Was there a lot of pressure on you?  Because like you said, your three older sisters were so bright.  So was there a lot of pressure?
Speaker 2: I felt that pressure in high--in senior high school [Frederick Douglass High School, Baltimore, Maryland].  In the--I didn't feel it in elementary school because it just didn't come up.  But the--when it really hit was when I was studying Latin and I didn't like Latin, and I didn't like the teacher, Mrs. Buchanan [ph.], who was a lovely lady.  My father [George Russell, Sr.] came up and she said, "I don't know what's wrong with this boy.  The rest of your children," he called my father George, were, "they were bright and they work hard, but Sonny," I finally passed Latin and I was glad to get away from it.  But they all knew my father.  And therefore they had very little problem with discipline.
Story_ID: 217626
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Judge [George Russell], during the elementary school years [at P.S. 103; Henry Highland Garnet Elementary School, Baltimore, Maryland], did you have dreams and aspirations at that time?  What did you wanna be when you grew up?
Speaker 2: In the third grade I wanted to be a lawyer.  We all had to state, we all had to state that we--what we wanted to be in life.  Everybody had to want to be somebody.  And I had--from that point I always wanted to be a lawyer and everything that I did was to pursue that objective.  And if it was inconsistent with it, it was cast aside.  And Robin Bishop [ph.], my good friend, best friend, he wanted to be a physician.  And in spite of the poverty that he endured, he made it through Lincoln [University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania] and Howard [University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] and became a physician in the [U.S.] Navy.  But everyone in that, in our class, had to be, want to be somebody.  It was an academic school and they expected the best out of you.
Speaker 1: Why did you wanna be a lawyer?  Did you know any black lawyers?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I, I liked the, I liked the idea of arguing trial--being a trial lawyer.  And I don't know where it came from.  The--we did not have that many lawyers--black lawyers--that I could witness during that time who were doing trials because of the segregation.  But nevertheless, that was instilled in me and, and I pursued it.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite lawyer, like was Perry Mason--
Speaker 2: I used to watch 'Perry Mason' and watch--I still watch all those shows, 'Law and Order' and things dealing with the law.  But I also I was under the influence of William W. Allen, who's Grand Master of the Masons and I worked for him selling real estate.  And there I saw lawyers working and this was later.  And so that I was exposed to the business life and to the law.
Story_ID: 217627
Speaker 1: Can you tell us the name of your junior high school and what those experiences were like?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I went to Booker T. Washington Junior High School on McCulloh Street [Booker T. Washington Middle School, Baltimore, Maryland].  And it was similar in that all of the teachers knew me, they knew my family.  And the group of us, a fella named Lewis Richardson [ph.], Robert Bishop [ph.] and I, we all became close friends and we kind of competed academically.  And it was a very wonderful and rich experience.  And we had wonderful, good teachers who cared about us and who would nurture us and watch us.  The--it was a teacher there that taught hygiene and he really went after all of the boys to make certain that their hygiene was correct.
Speaker 1: So hygiene was a class?
Speaker 2: It was a part of his class, yes.  And he was a huge teacher.  He suffered from elephantitis, so he was huge.  But he was a very wise man who gave, gave forth a lot of wisdom.  And my, my memory is a joyful one.  I enjoyed school.
Speaker 1: What was your favorite subject during junior high school?
Speaker 2: Well I guess English.  I, I liked everything except Latin.  But I didn't find school difficult because we had the--in our home we had a pattern and a discipline for study.  So if you studied, you would pass and it was just a matter of personal rivalry as to who was going to come out first, second or third between--it was a group of us, but primarily the three of my friends and I.
Story_ID: 217628
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about how you spent your spare time during like those pre-teen, early teenage years?  What were some of the things that you enjoyed doing after school?
Speaker 2: Well very early in life I was--would shoot marbles.  I can remember that.  I can remember very early when I had my tonsils taken out and my father [George Russell, Sr.] came to the hospital and I was on the floor shooting marbles.  And so they knew I could go home.  But the--I have always worked.  This is not to say I, I didn't party.  I had good times, but I have always worked through, throughout my whole life because I had that discipline and I wanted to achieve certain objectives.  And if they required money, I would work for it and do it.
Speaker 1: What kind of jobs did you have during junior high school [Booker T. Washington Junior High School; Booker T. Washington Middle School, Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: I sold papers.  I would get up at four [o'clock] in the morning and I'd go out with the [Baltimore] Sun papers and that was four to eight.  My mother [Anna Marie Short Russell] would wake us--wake me up and I worked at the drugstores, at Silver Fountain [ph.].  I enjoyed that because all of the pretty girls would come in and I would give 'em big scoops of ice cream.  I worked as, at other pharmacists--pharmacies that sold liquor when I was of age.
Story_ID: 217629
Speaker 1: But I always had a job and one time, when I came home from Lincoln [University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania] I didn't have a job, my mother [Anna Marie Short Russell] gave me bus fare to Atlantic City [New Jersey] and a postcard and told me to get out.  I had to work.  And I went to Atlantic City and I'll never forget that experience; it was wonderful.
Speaker 2: What kind of work did you do there?
Speaker 1: Well at first I was a soda jerk on the [Atlantic City] Boardwalk at the fountain.  And it was serving ice cream.  But then I started selling water.  The people from the beach would come in and they would want water and I would sell it to 'em in a cup and then I got fired (laughter).  So I went up to a minister who was up there and he knew me and he gave me, asked me if I could cook.  I said, sure, I'm a short order cook, I can do that.  And I sat down and ate a huge meal and he asked me to cut some tomatoes.  And when he saw me slice the tomatoes so thick, he fired me.  He told me you're not a cook.  And finally I wound up--in those days it was Kentucky Avenue and the Club Harlem [Atlantic City, New Jersey].  And you'd see Joe Louis and all of the stars.  It was--because of segregation, although at the Club 500 [sic. 500 Club, Atlantic City, New Jersey], they had Frank Sinatra.  I was at Lincoln then and would come there during the summer.  But we finally found a job that I kept and we made money during that summer and went back to college.
Story_ID: 217630
Speaker 1: So let's talk a little bit more, going back to the [Booker T. Washington] Junior High School [Booker T. Washington Middle School, Baltimore, Maryland] years.  Were you still aspiring to become a lawyer?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, absolutely.  I never waned from that objective.  And never failed to not engage.  If I wasn't working, I was pursuing that effort and working consistent with achieving that objective.  Everything (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Now let's talk a little bit about high school.  What was the name of your high school and what were your experiences like there?
Speaker 2: Frederick Douglass Senior High School [Frederick Douglass High School, Baltimore, Maryland].  Again, this was the most popular high school in the city.  I was with the same students.  We had teachers who knew my father [George Russell, Sr.] and knew the family and knew my three sisters ahead of me.  So they were all aware of me.  I couldn't make the basketball team or the football team, so I became the water boy.  And because I could then travel.  And a lot of the people, particularly Bishop [Lee] Robinson, who was the first black police commissioner in Baltimore City [Maryland], at the time I was a young lawyer, he was a young policeman.  And I would cross-examine him when he would arrest my clients and I'd tell the jury I carried water for him.  And, but the, the point was to get to the games.  And to be a part of the all the activities.  So to do that, I became the water boy, I didn't mind.  But we had a debating society.
Speaker 1: Were you active in the debating club?
Speaker 2: Yes, and--
Speaker 1: Did you enjoy that?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: 'Cause did it make you feel like a lawyer sometimes?
Speaker 2: Yes, well I like to talk, I like to express myself.  And we had a teacher who was very didactic and she would tell us to pronounce ed-u-cation.  And all of these experiences contributed to the maturity and growth of the children and the--it's so sad that we don't have that today.  And that's part of the reason I'm working so hard on this museum [Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History & Culture, Baltimore, Maryland].  I'm sure it came from the rich experience I had.  The teachers taught English, Spanish.  The math teacher was I said, Thurgood Marshall's relative [Cy Marshall].  And it was a very rich and enjoyable time in my life.
Speaker 1: And you were edit- sports editor of the paper.
Speaker 2: I was sports editor of the newspaper.  And I never forget, I would feature who I wanted to feature and I, a guy named Hank Parker [Henry E. Parker] who lived on Lanvale Street, we grew up together.  He later became the treasurer of the State of Connecticut.  And I, when I see him, I said, "I made you."  And the same with Bishop Robinson, the police commissioner.  He was on the football team.  And so I would become a part of all of that by being the sports editor.

Speaker 1: What were your thoughts about college when you were in high school [Frederick Douglass High School, Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: I didn't think about it and I didn't have to because Reverend John [T.] Colbert, the Presbyterian minister who later became the first presiding elder, I think, told me I was going to Lincoln [University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania].  He lived--he sat on the steps and my father [George Russell, Sr.] was there and he called out, and I got in.  And so that it was never any question and of course at that time Lincoln University was one of the schools.  I mean it was a premier school, it educated over 50 percent of the lawyers and physicians.  And I had a, an enjoyable time there as well.  It was an all-male school and up the road we had Cheyney [State Teachers College; Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, Cheyney, Pennsylvania], which was an all-girls school.  And needless to say I, most of us were barred from the campus at Chaney.  But one time I got in a problem and I was put out and I went to see Reverend Colbert and he called up and got me back in the school. I think--
Speaker 1: What kind of problem did you have?
Speaker 2: I think we were taking food from the refectory, from the cafeteria, they called it a refectory up there.  And the lady caught me, said, "You out."  But I, I again because I was with Bishop Richardson [ph.] and the same group of people that started, we enjoyed it.  We had--[HistoryMaker] Roscoe [Lee] Browne was there, he, he taught us and I was majored in economics.  And during that time, we were--the people from Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] would send the professors down to Lincoln and my professor was Gerald Darilan [ph.], and he taught--he was an expert in public utility economics, which I took.  And it enabled me then to understand.  I became a board member of the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company [BGE] and Constellation Energy [Group], and of course that knowledge and that training helped me to understand public utilities.  But Lincoln was a premier school and it was basically an academic school.  And no matter, you had to take three years of foreign language, regardless of your major.  We had to take Latin and Greek derivatives.  Had to take religion, and so that the guys coming up majored in physical education and the football players, had to go through all of this the same as everyone else.  It was a pre-med or pre-law school, and it was designed primarily for academics.
Story_ID: 217632
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about some of the activities you were involved in at Lincoln [University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Well I couldn't play football and I was first one cut from the basketball team and--but we had a debating society, and I was a part of that.
Speaker 1: Did you all travel to other schools?
Speaker 2: Yes, pri- the biggest school to beat was Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] though, I mean there was really hard feeling between Howard man and the Lincoln man; Howard boy and the Lincoln man.  But the other activities, I was a student teacher in economics.  And--or an assistant.  And I would in my senior year grade exams for the freshman.  So, but because it was a job.  I always had a hustle.  I worked in the refractory serving people and food.  Refectory.  And, and that's when I got in trouble giving away the food and, but they also had a school of religion at Lincoln.  And they would always have lecturers to come in and we were required to go to church on Sunday.  Didn't matter, and if you missed church, you were disciplined.  And--
Speaker 1: Did you ever miss?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, we had ways of getting out of it.  It was a group of us that controlled it, so you learn to be innovative.  We did at Lincoln.  And then I used to go to Delaware on the bread truck to go down to--on French Street in [Wilmington] Delaware.  And we'd go to the Elks Lodge and we'd have a ball down there.  And wait for the bread truck and come, come back to the Lincoln.  I didn't have any money.  As a matter of fact, they--on the picture, they nicknamed me Hucklebuck Daddy.  I don't know if you remember the dance called the Hucklebuck.  And always wears a suit.  Wonder if he has two.  I didn't have but one suit.  So all of the memories are, are joyous ones and because it was fun filled.  And the president of Lincoln at that time was Horace Mann Bond.  And his son [HistoryMaker] Julian Bond was running around the campus, and we used to tell him get away from him.
Speaker 1: And you pledged fraternity.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: What fraternity did you pledge?
Speaker 2: Kappa Alpha Psi [Fraternity].  Is there any other?  But Baltimore [Maryland] was a Kappa town and it still is.  And as a matter of fact, our museum [Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History & Culture, Baltimore, Maryland] is named after Reginald [F.] Lewis and he was Kappa and there's gonna be a grand celebration for Reginald--

Speaker 1: What were your thoughts about law school?  Where were you thinking about going to law school once you graduated from undergrad [Lincoln University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Of course I wanted to go to Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and I applied.  And, but my, my mother [Anna Marie Short Russell] and father [George Russell, Sr.] says, "You're going to Maryland [University of Maryland School of Law; University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law, Baltimore, Maryland]."  And the tuition was one hundred dollars, which we had to scrape up.  And I walked to school
Speaker 1: One hundred dollars a semester?
Speaker 2: A semester, and I walked to school.  And there was books that were available, second hand books that you could get, and syllabuses that you could buy.  But because I was selling real estate, I always had money and we made it through law school.
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate from Lincoln?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty [1950].
Speaker 1: Okay and then from there you went on to the University of Maryland law school.
Speaker 2: Yes, well I spent a year in, in the [U.S.] Census Bureau, I worked for a year 'cause I didn't have any money when I came out of Lincoln.  And then I went to law school from '51 [1951] to '54 [1954].
Story_ID: 217634
Speaker 1: What happened in 1954 that kind of derailed your career slightly in terms of--well you were drafted.
Speaker 2: I was drafted, yes.  They were after me for a long time, the lady at the draft board, because her son was in Korea.  And I had political influence and my medical problems that all of which were rejected.  And she promised me that the moment I got my degree, that I'd be in the [U.S.] Army.  She followed me, literally.  And then there was a clause that said I could stay out to take the bar exam.  And she said well when you drop the pen, you're going in the Army.  And we took it the Monday and Tuesday in the last week of July and that following Monday I was at Fort Gordon, Georgia.  And when they said take one step forward, you're in the Army, she looked at me and waved and said bye bye.  But the, then I, I went to--in those days only two blacks were gonna pass the bar exam, we knew that.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Because the--they were segregated.  They were just racist.  And I could not take a bar review course because we were black.  And so we studied together and we--this guy named Ginsburg [ph.] that gave the bar review course, we spotted fourteen questions and he only spotted seven.  And so I took the bar exam and then when I was in Camp Gordon, Georgia, my mother [Anna Marie Short Russell] wrote me, said I passed it.  And then I came back on the fourteen-day leave and got admitted.  And then I was--it's interesting, I went back to Fort Jackson, South Carolina.  They were sending all of the black troops to Alaska.  But they needed lawyers in Germany.  So they--that's how I got to Heidelberg, Germany.
Story_ID: 217635
Speaker 1: Let's back up just a second.  Tell me a little bit about--we didn't really talk that much about law school [University of Maryland School of Law; University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law, Baltimore, Maryland].  How did you enjoy law school and what was--what were some of your favorite classes in law school?
Speaker 2: Well I enjoyed law school.  It's very interesting--the--in the first semester, they flunked every woman in the class.  And they flunked every black except three. That was me, Jack Leeds [ph.] and Jay Mccray [ph.].  And one of the professors named Ruge [ph.] was lecturing in agency.  And this black man stole a car from the garage and the question was, was his master liable?  And Professor Ruge says, "That darkie was on a frolic of his own."  Well everyone in the class got a good, the blacks in the class got excited, they went up to see him.  And he said well I knew what I--was not surprised, should not call you niggers.  But I didn't know darkie was offensive, and since it is I apologize to you.  And I went out, they were still mad.  I said that's good enough for me.  I said, y'all have called me worse than that.  But he was, he meant it.  The man who wrote the book was named [Samuel] Williston from Harvard [Law School, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and he taught Ruge, and Ruge was deep from the heart of Georgia.  But he was one of the fairest professors that we had down there.  And I did very well under him.  And I liked law school.  The worst course I had was domestic relations, but the--
Speaker 1: What made it the worst?
Speaker 2: I didn't--I wasn't interested.  I just didn't like it and it wasn't challenging.  Well I took future interests and the other courses in the practice.  I, I never liked divorce law.  If it was uncontested, I would do it, but I, I just couldn't tolerate the problems that existed between people when they're arguing over the garbage can and trying to destroy each other.  But law school was also a joy and I made a lot of long, lifelong friends.  This is my fiftieth year in the practicing law.  I finished--is admitted in 1954 and this is 2004.  And in November we'll celebrate our fiftieth class reunion.
Story_ID: 217636
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Judge [George] Russell if I'm not mistaken, I think you are the one hundredth black lawyer in Maryland?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  That was ascertained by [HistoryMaker] Professor [Larry] Gibson when he did the research.  And so they honored me as being the one hundredth lawyer.
Speaker 1: And what were your thoughts about that--were you surprised you were the one hundredth, or where did you--
Speaker 2: Yes, I was surprised.  Well really with the, the--I didn't realize it was a hundred lawyers admitted when they first starting admitting lawyers, and it was just the luck of the draw that I was the number one hundred.  But now they--we, we have black lawyers everywhere.
Speaker 1: And now let's go back to 1954 when you were drafted in the [U.S.] Army and sent to [Heidelberg] Germany.  And you actually had an opportunity to practice law.  What, what were you doing in Germany for the Army?
Speaker 2: Well when I, when I was admitted to the bar, I refused the commission as an officer because--
Speaker 1: What does that mean, Judge?
Speaker 2: Well I did not go to Judge Advocate General School [The Judge Advocate General's Legal Center and School, Charlottesville, Virginia] to become an Army lawyer, where you would be an officer and lieutenant because you had to serve three years from the date of the commission and that would added more time in the Army.  I'd already served six months.  So none of us accepted commissions.  Therefore, the enlisted guys were doing the same things that the officers would do.  And I was in charge of the section of courts and boards.  We had a WAC [Women's Army Corps] detachment there and I worked, reported directly to the colonel.  And when their discipline reports would come in, I would determine with the colonel what--whether they should be court-martialed or what the punishment would be.  Also we acted as lawyers for the soldiers.  And the--I was the only black soldier that the--in the, in the company that was a lawyer, but yet the line sent to see me grew longer, the whites wanted to talk to me because they knew I understood trouble.  From their background, I would know.  And we got some terrible problems.  One man called home and ano- he heard a male voice telling the--stop calling home and the check is late and he pulled the telephone out of the wall he was so angry.  So I prosecuted him for destroying government property.  Didn't seem fair, but that's the way it is.  And then we--the--we interacted with the Germans and about ten kilometers from our barracks was the place called Mannheim [Germany].  And you could tell where the black troops had been in Europe because they were segregated because you saw black children.  And I studied German three years at Lincoln [University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania] and I would tell the child to (unclear) and he would look.  And then we would see--I went to Garmisch[-Partenkirchen, Germany] to stu- take courses in income tax.  And we made the whole experience was a joyful one also because I was in the unit with engineers and lawyers and professionals.  They took all of us because we were servicing the generals.  And otherwise I would have been in Alaska.
Story_ID: 217637
Speaker 1: And was it exciting for you to actually be practicing law at that time?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It--in a sense we were practicing law, in a sense, yes.  We got a lot of respect, particularly from the company commanders because we had power and knowledge and was close to the headquarters' commandant.  And we did special and summary court-martials.  The general court marshals you had to be an officer, and so we never became involved in that.  But we had a WAC [Women's Army Corps] detachment there and the--
Speaker 1: What's that, what's a WAC detachment?
Speaker 2: Oh--Women's Army Corps.  They were female soldiers.  And they had their own unit, and their own housing on base.  And the problems they generated was just unbelievable, and I'm not going into 'em, but it was really a, an experience.  And then to interact with the German lawyers, the Recson Baltz [ph.], sometimes a soldier would commit a crime in Germany, or in German territory and we'd have to ship him home to keep him from being prosecuted.  And I, I witnessed--was in Munich [Germany] when we had separate bars.  They brought the racism from America right to Europe.  And this was a white bar and a black bar.  So they put the black soldier out and he went back and got two hand grenades and came back and rolled it in the bar.  And the last time I saw him, he was in chains coming back to America. But he just blew up the place.  The--at that time the--we, we were not at war, but the Russians [sic. Soviets] would come down like all, the war was breaking out.  And then stop.  And of course this got the nerves of some of the soldiers and they had all kinds of conditions.  But that didn't affect me because I was at headquarters and as long as you were with the general, no harm was gonna come.  But it enabled me to go to Paris [France] and where I had a wonderful time.  And I went to Italy and to Greece.  And so it was really enjoyable opportunity and I was glad that I had passed the bar before I went in the [U.S.] Army.  And so I returned to practice law and I had seven clients waiting for me the day I got out.
Speaker 1: And you left the Army in what year?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-six [1956].
Story_ID: 217638
Speaker 1: And where did you go in 1956?
Speaker 2: I started to practice law with Brown, Allen and Watts over in East Baltimore [Maryland].  And I'd written them while I was in the [U.S.] Army and they accepted me and from there, it was--everything just went on fine.  I had started a beautiful career.
Speaker 1: And how long were you at Brown, Allen, Watts?
Speaker 2: Well we, we formed a new firm.  And Brown, Allen, Watts, Murphy & Russell [Baltimore, Maryland].  [HistoryMaker William H.] Murphy [Sr.] was a senior lawyer, he later became a judge, and his son [William H. "Billy" Murphy, Jr.] became a judge.  We were the first lawyers to move downtown.  At that time they would not rent to black lawyers in the business area.  We all had to be in the neighborhood.  And this, as a matter of fact this building, One Charles Center [Baltimore, Maryland], which accepted federal funds so they had to admit us.  And the B&O [Baltimore and Ohio] Railroad had the entire building.  So I started on the fourth floor in 1963.  And they cut an office up for us in the middle where if you came off the elevator, you saw us.  And our practice quadrupled.  People came from everywhere.  We came--many of us were fearful that the blacks would not come downtown to see us.  And they did.  And we were very, very successful.  And up until 1966 where I allowed them to--I became a judge in 1966.  And in looking back, I wondered if we had just kept that firm going and--but because there were no black judges, they, they picked the, the best we had to offer.  And then I became a judge and I stayed a judge until January 1st, 1968.  We had a big political--
Speaker 1: You were a judge on circuit court.
Speaker 2: The first black on the circuit court of Maryland.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I sat, while there, I was appointed to sit on appellate courts.  And I was the first black to sit on the appellate court of Maryland--
Story_ID: 217639
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about what kinds of cases you dealt with on circuit court [in Maryland]?
Speaker 2: As a judge?
Speaker 1: Yes sir.
Speaker 2: Well that was the primary court for all of the serious criminal cases, and all of the civil cases.  They had a district court below who would hear traffic and cases and minor criminal cases.  But then the criminal law, murder, rape, and in the--so on the civil side the--all the large case--civil cases are being tried and, or in equity court.  But it was a court of record.  The first--it was a primary court for citizens.
Story_ID: 217640
Speaker 1: --Are there any particular cases that really stand out in your mind?  Any particular cases?
Speaker 2: Well I found I was incapable of imposing the death penalty.  I was sitting in court and it was a terrible case, a rape case.  And I looked at the young boy and I looked at his mother.  Then I looked over at the--it was a racial problem, case.  I looked over the family of the victim.  And they wanted vengeance, but I looked in the eyes of the boy's mother and I could not kill him, under no circumstances.  I didn't believe in it before, but then when I tried to sign the warrant, my hand became paralyzed and I when I was taken out of the courthouse like this.  And I said--"Take me to my doctor," and they--when I went in his office, he just hit the arm and because he knew me and he said, "whatever's on your mind, you gotta get it off."  But I could not look in the--that boy's mother's eyes and kill him, kill her son.
Story_ID: 217641
Speaker 1: Was there a lot of resistance from the white community [in Baltimore, Maryland] about having this black judge on the circuit court?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  Yeah--in Southeast Baltimore [Maryland] they had a newspaper, a guy named Ma Hankey [ph.] would sit in my court every day.  And he would write up, criticizing me and that one time my colleague Judge Harris [ph.], he was in the courtroom next to me and I decided a case.  And I released the man from jail.  And he was outraged.  And he was intoxicated and he blasted me in the [Baltimore] Sun paper.  And I was sitting in the barbershop when I was reading the paper and then the--I could feel the steam coming out.  And he was wrong.  And he said that--his remarks cost my election.  That he would resign and ask the governor to appoint me in his place.  So, and I--at the, at the meetings I knew all of the judges because I'd practiced before 'em.  But I told 'em at the first meeting if I hear a motion and it's a second and no discussion and it passes, and I don't know anything about it, it means you've had another meeting.  So, you know and then I became a part of the Catholic bloc because I, I succeeded the Chief Judge, Mike Manley [Michael J. Manley].  And in those days, you had to have so many Catholics and so many Protestants.  The police commissioner was a--had to be a Mason, the next one was a Catholic.  The president of the [Baltimore City] Bar Association [Bar Association of Baltimore City] rotated between the Catholics, Protestant and Jews.  Up comes [HistoryMaker George] Russell, and I'm Catholic.  And so they--because I'd worked so hard, I was the first black president of the bar association.  Well [Robert E.] Cahill [Sr.] was Catholic and normally he would be in that rotation.  So they elected Cahill and they started the rotation again.  And then later another black lawyer, Charles [H.] Dorsey [Jr.], became president.  And I don't know if that was--that rotation still exists.  But the Catholics complained to the Governor [J. Millard] Tawes about the appointment.  They said, "You told us you were gonna keep the Catholic quota."  And he said, "Well, Russell's Catholic."  He said, "Well, I'm--I'm not talking about that kind of Catholic."  So Governor Tawes said, "Well, I didn't know you had two kinds, I don't like none of you."  And he, and Tawes, the governor, called me.  He just laughed.  I mean he had a big kick out of that.  But I mean that happened--
Story_ID: 217642
Speaker 1: --[HistoryMaker] Judge [George] Russell, you had shared a story with us before about a friend of yours from the old neighborhood [in Baltimore, Maryland] and you all were reunited when you became a judge.  Can you tell us a little bit about that?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He came before me and as a matter of fact, we, we looked alike.  A lot of people would--mistaken us.  And he was so embarrassed that he would--he kept his head down and I looked at him.  And he shook his head to me as if to say, you know, you don't know me.  And so I looked at the officer.  I said, "I'm finding this man not guilty," and the officer looked.  I said, you know, "I'll listen to the evidence and I found him not guilty, nothing you can do."  And, but I couldn't, I couldn't do it.  I had to--Tucson [ph.] was my friend, we grew up and he--I saw him and he cried and we both cried.  But that was perhaps one of the most--I'll never forget it because he was so appreciative and I didn't want him to be ashamed because I was a judge and he was not.  And--
Speaker 1: What happened to you all when you were boys?
Speaker 2: Oh, Tucson and I?  Well we, we traveled together and as, as you know we were in sections.  And he was one of my protectors.  If I--I was a big agitator and Hugh Price Hughes [ph.], the doctor who lived across the street, his son, well he was a big guy.  And so we all went around and together.  We worked together, we played together.  But he was a real friend.  And he was in my house, I was in his house.
Speaker 1: And tell us the story about--I think you guys were playing football in the street one day and the police came.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well that--yeah, on Lanvale Street [Baltimore, Maryland].  We didn't have any playgrounds; we were playing football and the neighbors called the police, and they grabbed me and they put me in the car.  And when the grabbed Tucson, he pushed me out of the car and I ran up the alley and I mean I was running like Jesse Owens.  And they took Tucson down and I could--my whole life could have changed.  And that's the real reason that when Tucson came before me, I gave him the same break he gave me.
Story_ID: 217643
Speaker 1: So let's talk a little bit about when you moved to the appellate court [Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 2: Well I was especially assigned to the appellate court by the Chief Judge [Robert C.] Murphy.
Speaker 1: What year was that? Nineteen--
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-nine [1969].  And it was quite unusual for the, for them to see a black judge on the appellate court.  And I of course being there, I had prepared.  I read every case, I read everything.  And, and I decided the cases, made up my mind until I heard the arguments.  But in questioning the lawyers, I would simply cut the case down.  And I would tell one side, well, "I don't have any questions for you, unless the other judges do."  And we finished the docket in about thirty minutes.  And so the other judges said, "Look [HistoryMaker] George [Russell], you're so fast."  You--I said, "Well I read it.  It was right."  They said, "But you got to give people time to express themselves," and, and I guess they were right.  But I didn't feel that we should sit up and listen to nonsense.  And, and I wrote two opinions.  And I didn't realize it, because at the time of writing it, I didn't know, know what county it was coming from.  But I reversed two judges in Howard County [Maryland].  And of course when they saw this black judge reverse, that was big news up there.  And, and it was the talk of the--among the judicial circuit.  But it was quite an experience--
Story_ID: 217644
Speaker 1: When did you become city solicitor for Baltimore [Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-eight [1968].  I resigned the judgeship and became city solicitor.  And--
Speaker 1: You were the first African American?
Speaker 2: First, yeah, in a large city in the nation.  There was one other in Cincinnati [Ohio], McLean [ph.].  And there I had a staff of about 135 lawyers and the city solicitor had to approve everything that, that occurred in the city.  And that was quite an experience because we had--I was given a, a chauffeur and limousine.  And this is the first time that a black man was riding in the back seat of a city-owned vehicle that wasn't going to jail.  And there was a black city councilman that criticized us riding around in these limousines with the city and then I had a couple of cases that I tried that required police protection.
Speaker 1: What were those, what were they?
Speaker 2: Well I fired--one was this black man who was head of community schools.  And he drafted the community schools' program word-for-word from the Sunday New York Times.  And he was charged with being incompetent.  And at that time, the president of the school board [Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners] was a man named Francis [D.] Murnaghan [Jr.], who was later chief judge [federal judge] of the Fourth Circuit [U.S. Court of Appeals].  He asked me to come in and try the case personally because they wanted to take the element of race out of it.  And I said well if I think the case deems it, I will do it.  And I read it and I realized he plagiarized his whole program.  But at that time, the Black Panthers were on there and the Soul School [Baltimore, Maryland] and these kids were marching around with bad English on the letters--on their signs.  And the--couple of people threatened to burn down my house.  Well I jumped off the stage--we fired Hopkins [ph.] and it was 3:30 in the morning because of the noise, but we fired him.  And to go after the guys and the police grabbed me.  I said, "They're the ones that are gonna burn my house down."  So then I got twenty-four hour police protection.  We got new lights in the block.  The neighbors were so happy and there was a policeman who was guarding me, and he fell asleep.  So my father-in-law called him, "Get him away from here."  So they complained.  So they moved him.  So the city councilman was complaining that, that he lived around the corner from me, that he, too, was threatened.  So they sent this guy around to his house and put a new man in front of my house, and he fell asleep at the city councilman's house.  But that was the most eventful time of my life because then the riots came, we had a garbage strike.  And then during that period they were complaining about racial discrimination in the fire department.  The NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] sued.  I'm city solicitor, so I had to defend the city against the NAACP.  And well I won the case.  We proved the promotional system was fair.
Speaker 1: Was it bittersweet?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, it--I don't know whether it was sweet, it was bitter.  But in a sense I--it demonstrated to the black community that I was not the city solicitor for the blacks or the whites.  And throughout that entire tenure, I was too white to be black and too black to be white.  So I couldn't win in that situation.
Story_ID: 217645
Speaker 1: --In trying to balance between doing what's best for the city [Baltimore, Maryland] because that was your job [city solicitor].
Speaker 2: Well as long as--that was the job.  I mean I did what was best for the city.  For instance the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] came in and they wanted to use the [Baltimore] Convention Center [Baltimore, Maryland] for a meeting.  And so immediately the mayor sent it over to the city solicitor for an opinion.  And I came out, they had a lawful right to use it.  And course the blacks were angry and the whites saying gee, you know, they, they couldn't create the situation that they thought would occur because I would reject them being black.  I followed the law.  And ultimately that renowned me and enabled me to have the respect of the, particularly the [Baltimore City] Bar [Association].  I was really--always concerned that other lawyers respected me as a good lawyer.  I think that--and that was demonstrated later when I was inducted as a fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers.
Speaker 1: And you were also the first African American president of the Maryland [State] Bar Association.
Speaker 2: Baltimore City Bar Association.  Guy named Harry [S.] Johnson just became, just left as the first black president of the Maryland Bar.  I was the first delegate to the American Bar Association from Maryland who was black.  But it was the Baltimore City Bar where I was president.  And I did not pursue the Maryland Bar.
Story_ID: 217646
Speaker 1: In 1974, you went back into private practice.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: At Russell & Thompson [Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 2: Yes.  It's interesting.  Ken Thompson [Kenneth L. Thompson] grew up around the corner from where I--when I got married, I moved to Mosher Street, 2300 block, he lives on Wheeler [Avenue].  And he would come around and I had an Imperial, long Imperial and he was hiding behind my car and I was running and kicking at him.  But he later became a lawyer and he walked into my office and said, you know, "Can I practice?"  I said, "Have you taken the bar exam?"  He said, "Yes."  I said, "Do you have the results?"  He said, "No, but I'll get 'em Friday, but you know if you're not doing anything, I can use that office."  Anyhow, he came in and my secretary said, "You better watch him."  Said, "He, he's hungry, he's lean."  But we practiced together and we became partners.  We went to Piper & Marbury [Baltimore, Maryland] and (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Tell us about some of the cases you all--are there any particular cases that stand out to you that you, you all handled during that time?
Speaker 2: Thompson's first big case was I represented a black colonel in the police department who was charged with dealing with drug peddlers.  And the whole case was a frame.  And what was occurring was that he had a better relationship in the--with the black druggies and he could get information where the whites could not.  And so the whites who were corrupt, were concerned about him finding it out.  So they had to make a case on him.  And Ken Thompson took that case from voir dire all the way to the closing arguments.  He prepared all of the jury instructions, and he--people--we were producing so much, they thought we had ten lawyers working on the case.  But that was Ken.  That's when I knew Ken had it.  He--
Speaker 1: And you won that case?
Speaker 2: We won it, yes.  It was, it was a big case.  We won that.  We won William [Lloyd "Little Willie"] Adams that was the husband of the lady who taught me in elementary school.  And he's multi-millionaire.
Speaker 1: What was his case about?
Speaker 2: Lottery.  He was--he testified before the Kefauver committee of--that he was engaged in lottery.  And he--then they took that testimony and put it in the state court and convicted him and gave him seven years.
Speaker 1: What does that mean, that he was engaged in lottery?
Speaker 2: He was a numbers backer.
Speaker 1: Numbers, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and now the state is the backer.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: In those years, they'd give you a year for having a number slip in your possession.  And the interesting thing about that is that he went to Washington [D.C.] and he hired a black lawyer named George E. C. Hayes [George Edward Chalmer Hayes].  And Hayes told him, took a thousand dollars from him as a retainer and he said he would take the case and he won it.  And it's--Adams never hired a white lawyer to do anything seriously for him.  After that I was his lawyer.  And he was charged again.
Story_ID: 217647
Speaker 1: --You said he hired a black lawyer in Washington [D.C.].  Did you mean--
Speaker 2: George [E. C.] Hayes [George Edward Chalmer Hayes] in Washington had argued before the [U.S.] Supreme Court.  The white lawyer that he had wasn't a member of the Supreme Court Bar [Association; Bar of the Supreme Court of the United States] and he wanted Hayes to take him and introduce him.  Hayes said, "I don't need you."  And then he worked and won the case.  Then [William Lloyd "Little Willie"] Adams was, and this was interesting, he was charged again with, with lottery.  And we retained me--he retained me and Ken Thompson [Kenneth L. Thompson].  And all of the judges disqualified themselves except [HistoryMaker] Judge [Robert Mack] Bell.  And Judge Bell tried the case without a jury.  And we proved that the police faked Adams' voice, mislabeled his voice on the wiretap.  And we had to get an expert from the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland] who testified that was not Adams' voice.  We knew whose voice it was.  And Bell found him not guilty.  And--
Speaker 1: And Judge Bell is currently--
Speaker 2: The chief judge.
Speaker 1: First African American chief judge.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And, and there's a parallel there because Adams was a very powerful political figure.  And I mean that's why I became a judge with his support and Henry [G.] Parks [Jr.] who owned Parks Sausage Company [Baltimore, Maryland] in those days.  And--but Bell was the judge that found him not guilty.
Speaker 1: And so--
Speaker 2: But getting back to Ken Thompson.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: He, he has developed into one of the finest trial lawyers in the nation.  For instance, he's recently won cases for McDonnell Douglas [Corp., St. Louis, Missouri].  He represents the automobile manufacturers.  He is one good trial lawyer and I'm very, very proud of him.  And he, too, is a fellow of the American College of Trial Lawyers.  And we just recently had a third black in Maryland from Prince George's County [Maryland] to be inducted.  And when you have those kind of credentials, you just lay them down and just walk in.
Story_ID: 217648
Speaker 1: So--and you and [Kenneth L.] Thompson practiced together until 1986.  But let's talk about what happened in 1982 when you established the Harbor Bank [of Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland].  Why was there a need to create the Harbor Bank and how did that come about?
Speaker 2: Well the, well the blacks on the East Side [Baltimore, Maryland] ones that started the bank.  They didn't want anybody from the West Side; didn't want me, [Henry G.] Parks [Jr.], [William Lloyd "Little Willie"] Adams, [Raymond V.] Haysbert, any, we don't want any of the West Side blacks.  So I said, "Look, when you open your bank, I'll be the first customer."  They tried for ten years to get a charter to open this bank.  They had one week left and they had to raise 1,400,000 dollars in stock.  They--Joe Haskins [Joseph Haskins, Jr.] came to me and asked me if I could raise the money.  I called a white friend of mine, Louis Grasmick.  And in four days we raised a million four.  We got eight hundred thousand dollars from black people and six hundred thousand from whites.  And they had a white lawyer.  I told them he wanted to share the legal work.  I said no, you, you're out.  And, and I became chairman of the board.  And that's very interesting.  The, the (unclear) who's from East Baltimore [Maryland] was chairman.  And I'd brought all the money in, so we had an election.  I told one of the white people that I brought on, John Paterakis [Sr.] that owns H&S Bakery [Baltimore, Maryland], he was having dinner.  I said, "Come on, we're having the election."  "You don't need me."  "Come on."  And we went in and they had the election and I won it by one vote as chairman of the board.  And he became vice-chairman.  Again, the East Side/West Side.  But, and the bank now is flourishing under Joe Haskins' leadership.
Speaker 1: And it's one of the largest minority-owned banks in the country today.
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely--
Story_ID: 217649
Speaker 1: Why was there a need to create a Harbor Bank [of Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland]?  Why was there a need to create such a thing?
Speaker 2: Because the other banks were not fair with black people.  Their practices had been documented as being unfair.  They would charge us higher interest and, and this enabled us to go into a field and to break it open.  I mean the--and as a result of it now, the white banks are bringing Harbor Bank in on all of the big real estate deals and we should be in banking like everyone else.  And this gave us an opportunity and as a result, the other banks are hiring blacks and it has opened up a whole new vista, a new field for blacks.  It did then.
Speaker 1: 'Cause the bottom line is that there's one color that really matters, and that's--
Speaker 2: Green.  That's why they wanted a black bank.  And I told 'em, I've never seen a black bank in my life.  They didn't wanna bring any white people in.  I said that's not the way it goes and so I brought in the whites and a couple of people dissented.  I said, "Well, y'all will have to leave," because it's--a bank is green, it's money.  And as a re- all the development and in Harbor a lot of that white supplied to the Harbor Bank because the developer was [John] Paterakis [Sr.] or other board members.  And that's the same with the African American museum [Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History & Culture, Baltimore, Maryland].  We have an integrated board.  We've got very wealthy whites on the board and, and that not only gives us credibility and respect, but that's the way it should be.  And, and they should understand it and enjoy our history.  And they are really working hard and the, they're heavy contributors.
Speaker 1: Because African American history isn't just for African Americans and we aren't the only benefactors of African American history.
Speaker 2: That is correct.  And African American--the struggle was aided by many, many white people.  Not just through the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], but through the friends with the Underground Railroad--
Speaker 1: And the Quakers [Religious Society of Friends]--
Speaker 2: --there were white people who helped it.  And people forget that.  And they keep emphasizing color and it just didn't--that's not the truth.  And that's why we have to get a hold of our young people to teach them the truth.
Story_ID: 217650
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Judge [George] Russell let's talk about 1986.  You [Russell & Thompson, Baltimore, Maryland] merged your firm with a predominantly white firm, Piper & Marbury [Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What kind of reaction did that get in both communities, the black community as well as the white community?
Speaker 2: Well the negotiations were truly secret.  And, and when it broke, when I read the paper, I was surprised.  And it's sent shockwaves over this community.  Many of the blacks were bitter because they said we had an opportunity with Russell & Thompson, and now we were--we don't have the opportunity that [HistoryMaker George] Russell had to go in the other firm.  Course they were later shown to be incorrect.  But I took a lot of heat from the black community for that move.  And I think later I've been vindicated.  Because the only--Ken [Kenneth L. Thompson] did not wanna go.  And the only other lawyer that was for going was Bob Watts [Robert B. Watts], who was Brown, Allen, & Watts [Baltimore, Maryland] when I came out of the [U.S.] Army.  And of course he, he thought it was wonderful and that should have been our, that was our objective all along, to become a part of the mainstream.  And as a result here today, it's--you go into any firm and apply.  I don't still say the racism is gone, but at least on the surface if you've got the credentials, you can go into any firm.  And there are very few firms that do not have black lawyers.
Speaker 1: How did you convince Thompson that this, this would be a good thing?
Speaker 2: Well I didn't.  He said, "I've been with you this long, and you know you've been right.  So I'll go--I'mma go along with it."  And he was converted when the money came in.  And he recognized that he was in a new category.  And we were making money as, as Russell & Thompson.  But when we got the Harbor Bank [of Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland] as a client, I didn't know banking law.  So I had to farm it out to Piper.  And we were getting tax problems; I'm a trial lawyer.  Farmed it out.  And I said, "Ken, let's look at our practice.  Everything's on the farm.  And we might as well go and join the farm."  And he was not convinced, but he did become convinced after he was respected and he realized that he was probably best--better than most of the lawyers in trial because he had a very smooth way of trying a case.  He would glide across the courtroom and he would wear the different kind of cologne and he'd take a dip in front of the female juror and all kinds of techniques.  I didn't use those, but he is a tremendous person and a tremendous lawyer.
Story_ID: 217651
Speaker 1: Why was this merger [Russell & Thompson and Piper & Marbury, Baltimore, Maryland] historic?  In--nationally historic.  What made it that way?
Speaker 2: Because as the [Baltimore] Sun paper described it, this was a white shoes firm, a silk stocking firm and I went down there and looked for silk stockings and everybody had cotton stockings on and it broke the myth, it broke the cast.  The law was the--one of the last bulwarks of segregation.  They didn't want women, only white men were to be lawyers, traditionally.  And that's why when I went to law school [University of Maryland School of Law; University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law, Baltimore, Maryland] they flunked out all the women.  They just didn't think women should be lawyers.  And, but that, that was a--as I said, it made national news.  And we were recognized and praised, and particularly Piper, for what they were doing.  The newspapers all praised the move.
Speaker 1: And did some blacks at Russell & Thompson, did they, did they lose their jobs or did--or was it just the attorneys who went, or did secretaries go, clerks?
Speaker 2: Loddy doddy and everybody went.  The clerks, everybody went.  They took the entire Russell & Thompson family into Piper & Marbury.  And the--
Speaker 1: So it was integrated on all levels.
Speaker 2: On all levels.  And they wanted me to be a partner, but I said I would not come if Ken [Kenneth L. Thompson] was not made a partner.  And so they made Ken a partner as well.  And [Robert B.] Watts was of-counsel.  And the others were in--associates.  And what occurred was the other firms--I had a guy named Hitchcock [ph.].  Well then another firm--Frank, Bernstein [Frank, Bernstein, Conaway & Goldman, Baltimore, Maryland] offered him a partnership and he left.  Audrey [J.S.] Carrion, she got a big, big offer from the attorney general's office, and now she's a circuit court judge.  And Piper had trouble keeping the blacks that they admitted.
Speaker 1: Because they were getting better opportunities.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They were lured away.
Story_ID: 217652
Speaker 1: We left off talking about the merger [Russell & Thompson and Piper & Marbury, Baltimore, Maryland] and so in your opinion, was the merger successful?  If--when you look back at it now, you know, almost twenty years later?
Speaker 2: It was the best thing that ever happened.  It, it opened the vistas and opened doors for the lawyers.  It completely changed the character and the practice of law, particularly for the black lawyer.  Now not that racism is gone, but there's no reason for it not to succeed, for a black person not to succeed.  And so I think it brought seat change to the practice of law, and it's all over the country now.
Story_ID: 217653
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your latest project with the Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History [& Culture, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you were a little reluctant to take that on at first.  Tell us a little bit about how it first came about.
Speaker 2: Well I think the idea started with Governor [William D.] Schaefer.  And he talked with--
Speaker 1: And this is Maryland governor Donald Schaefer.
Speaker 2: William Donald Schaefer.  And--who was president of the [Baltimore] City Council when I was city solicitor [for Baltimore, Maryland], and when he ran for mayor, I ran against him.  And he did--he defeated me.  And he said, he always said I never lost because of the success I've had in the, in the practice of law.  But Schaefer and [HistoryMaker Howard] "Pete" Rawlings were the people who were pushing the idea of an African American museum.  And they wanted someone to head it who had credibility in the black community and the white community.  So Schaefer called me.  I said to him I didn't know anything about museums, I wasn't interested and I didn't have the time to do this.  So he asked me twice and then [Louis] Lou [J.] Grasmick who is chairman of the fundraising, or development, he went to the governor and he said you should have--no, the governor asked Lou who he could get to head the African American museum.  He said well [HistoryMaker George] Russell.  He said, "Well he's turned me down twice and I'm not gonna ask him again."  And Grasmick came to see me and Pete Rawlings called.  And--
Speaker 1: And who's Pete Rawlings?
Speaker 2: Oh, Howard Pete Rawlings who's the chairman of the [Maryland House of Delegates] appropriations committee.  He's one of the most powerful men in the history of Maryland.  And he recently passed.  And when I realized what a benefit it would be to the, particularly to the African American community, but to the general community, I got into it.  And it is perhaps one of the most, most worthwhile endeavors that I've ever attempted to do, and the most satisfying.  And it's a very challenging thing.  All of the things that I saw coming up and all of the poverty that I see around the--our community, makes me understand how desperately we needed this museum.
Story_ID: 217654
Speaker 1: And what's the main purpose of the museum [Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History & Culture, Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: The main purpose of the museum is to demonstrate to African American children that poverty is not a bar to success.  Their condition can be overcome and the museum will show them by examples and by history.  They will understand who they are, where they came from and they will be proud of themselves.  And the, the thing that we want to get them is to inspire them so that they will aspire to become somebody.
Speaker 1: Just like your father [George Russell, Sr.] used to say.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  And the--we'll have people like Dr. Ben Carson [HistoryMaker Dr. Benjamin Carson, Sr.] is on our board.  Who in his book 'Gifted Hands[: The Ben Carson Story,' Ben Carson, M.D., Cecil B. Murphey] told how he stabbed a kid in Detroit [Michigan] when he was a young boy and the belt buckle stopped it, and he found Christ.  There are many more neurosurgeons and lawyers and all kinds of talent in the community, and it can't get out.  They are, they are locked into the community.  At one time when I was young the home was the castle; it was the haven, safe haven.  And my parents would tell me, again my parents would tell me leave that out in the street; don't bring that here.  Well now there are no parents and the street has taken over the house.  And these kids--yesterday is today and tomorrow is today, and they are trapped.  And their only escape in their mind is through criminal behavior.  I'm reading now the statistics on black incarceration.  Because the system now is not designed to overtly discriminate; they don't even worry about covertly discriminating.  But there's, in my mind, a systematic program to arrest black youth, and they do it in a massive basis--on a massive basis, and it gives them a fingerprint and a photograph in the criminal system.
Story_ID: 217655
Speaker 1: It's interesting, yesterday I represented a son of a college professor and a schoolteacher who was arrested and he did have cocaine--I mean marijuana in his car.  But the police didn't show up to prosecute him, so the case was dropped.  But it doesn't end there.  Their picture and their photographs are in the system.  So I have to file a petition for expungement to take those out of the system.  Well these kids are fortunate because they have parents who have means and they contacted me who understands the system to get it out.  But to the poor guy's family who do not have it, that picture will be in an array of rape suspects and somebody may pick them out.  And this is the way that the system is dealing with the issue of--race.  And it's the police that's doing it, and they do it on a massive basis.  And it's got to be stopped.  And what, what has happened is that the--there are 2.1 million people incarcerated in America.  Over 40 percent are black.  In Maryland the percentage is seventy.  And so this--unless we can do something to grab these kids and turn 'em around, and we have got to let them understand that there's a standard of moral accountability that they must adhere to.  But most of all we've got to make them understand Jesus Christ, and that he lives and exists for them, and I, I don't mean to be a preacher, but I understand that the mutuality of all of us is tied up in the belief in Christ or in some greater being that brings us together and teaches us mutual respect.  And when I look at these kids, it's just--when I was in district court, I don't get there often, but that's where I see these poor kids over in the [Baltimore City] Juvenile Justice Center [Baltimore, Maryland] that we just built, it's brand new.  The kids tore it up and we are worse off today as a group, than we ever were.  The, the, the difference between the middle class black and the impoverished blacks is wider and wider, it's greater and greater.  And we are going backwards.  And this museum [Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History & Culture, Baltimore, Maryland] is not simply serve the purpose of giving the history, but it will become a living, dynamic thing, particularly since we are bringing in education in the public schools.  That is the key to have these kids, and the white kids as well, to know that we're somebody.
Story_ID: 217656
Speaker 1: And tell us a little bit about the educational component of this museum [Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History & Culture, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 2: The museum and the [Maryland] State Department of Education formed a partnership.  And the museum for three years, the education department for three years under the leadership of Dr. Charles Christian at the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland], wrote a curriculum for from K [kindergarten] to twelve eventually.  They have ninety lesson plans.  And those plans have been reviewed by experts across the nation in African American history and culture for accuracy.  And we're now going to put it--this into the classroom.  And whites and blacks will study African American, Maryland African American history and culture as a part of their social studies program, coupled with that be a visit to the museum, and they'll be tested on what they learned because they will teach what's in the museum.  The most important aspect was to train the teachers because up to this point we were having Black History Month or Black History Week when I was in school.  And the teachers didn't have any idea what to teach.  So we brought together 114 teachers two weeks ago, three weeks ago, for three days.  We paid 'em $150 a day and we gave them, the museum gave them--the education department will give, give them three credits.  And these--I told them that they're pioneers and that we would list their name in the museum.  And it's interesting that when they took the course, they played a record.  And the guy, the teacher said, "Tell me, who that--who's playing that piece?"  And I said, "Duke Ellington."  He said, "No."  Young white boy came from the back of the room to pick up his prize, it was Chick Webb [William Henry Webb].  And he knew it because he had read the curriculum.  But the excitement that gripped that room from all of--black and white, made me realize how desperate we all are for knowledge, particularly of ourselves.  But without the understanding that there is a God, there is Jesus, in my belief and other beliefs there is a higher being that--under which we have this inescapable mutuality, adhering to the standard of morality, this is the only way we're gonna be saved and our community's going to be saved.  And I was before a foundation yesterday that said we don't give the museums.  I said, "Well just give me five minutes.  And I'm not asking for money for the museum."  And I explained the project.  Now we have to supply 'em with the information so that--about our monies that we are raising and, and they're gonna make a, a donation.  I have yet to go somewhere to have someone who is able to give, to fail to give.  And because we've hit upon this program where we can really make a difference, to me that's more self-satisfaction than I can possibly get.  And it's an exciting project.
Story_ID: 217657
Speaker 1: Can you kind of just take us on a quick tour of what the museum [Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History & Culture, Baltimore, Maryland] will be like?  What will you see when you go there?
Speaker 2: Oh boy.
Speaker 1: What kinds of things will be on display?
Speaker 2: I want you to know I've only seen it once.  You talk about the exhibits.
Speaker 1: Right, yes.
Speaker 2: Oh, well the--they have family--a family--it's divided into three sections and I'm not sure that I can do this accurately because I haven't been on that side of the museum.  But they will talk about work and the history of work, and we have there the watermen.  Well there's a section of when we came to America and what it was like, and what slavery was like.  We have manumission papers that were given to us, that perhaps is our most precious asset.  Where people can see what was required.  And we're going to give the students the tube that was, that they carried and let them feel the tube.  We have a company from California that's gonna donate to us something that we put on the kids' wrist and it points a light to a book and the book speaks to 'em.  And depending on the grade level.  They have it now I understand in the elementary schools in Prince George's County [Maryland].  And the manufacturing of this thing that's going to Yugoslavia, then it'll come to us and we'll have it, then the Smithsonian [Institution, Washington, D.C.] will get it.  But all of this is designed--we have, we have sports figures.  We have law and biographies and it'll run the whole gamut of the--of course it'll be a section on civil rights.  But it's devoted to Maryland African American history and culture.  Maryland is the richest state in the nation for African American history and culture.  And when you stop to think we have Benjamin Banneker, Thurgood Marshall, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, it goes on.
Speaker 1: And it's also considered to be the port of entry for Kunta Kinte as well.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  And it's interesting that recently they were fighting over Frederick Douglass' statute.  They wanted to put it in the [Clarence M. Mitchell, Jr.] Courthouse [Baltimore, Maryland] and the community, white community didn't want it because that was reserved for war heroes.  Something changed that community's idea and Frederick Douglass will be there.  Then you find Dorchester County [Maryland] saying, "We're the--this is the home of Harriet Tubman," and another county said, "no, we are."  Well what is this all about?  It's about tourism.  And we here in Baltimore [Maryland] with our statewide African American museum in the Inner Harbor [Baltimore, Maryland], will become an economic (unclear) to this city.  And we plan to go to each county in the state our first will be Prince George's, and we've been--others that are anxious for us to come.  Dorchester and Montgomery [County, Maryland] I'm certain, when we're in Prince George's, Montgomery will want it.  But this is an exciting statewide venture that we believe that will have the capacity to change lives and change attitudes.
Story_ID: 217658
Speaker 1: --Tell us a little bit about the person who it's [Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History & Culture, Baltimore, Maryland] named after, Reginald F. Lewis.
Speaker 2: Reginald F. Lewis, he was born on the East Side [Baltimore, Maryland].  And he went through [Paul Laurence] Dunbar High School [Baltimore, Maryland], my sister taught him and [HistoryMaker] Judge [Robert Mack] Bell who was his classmate, and he, he then went to Virginia State [University, Petersburg, Virginia] on a football scholarship.  He got hurt and he lost his scholarship.  He worked his way through Virginia State, he went to Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And then he joined a big New York [New York] law firm.  And then later he formed his own firm.  And the rest is history.  He ultimately acquired Beatrice Foods [Company; TLC Beatrice International] and became a billionaire.  And one of the last things his family--he told his family he wanted was an African American--museum of African American history and culture.  And they came here, Mrs. [Loida Nicolas-]Lewis, looking for whoever was involved in this museum project.  And we were operating so quietly, that my sister and Mrs. Lewis's mother go to the same parish.  And she said--and my sister got a hold of 'em and they, they gave us five million dollars.  And that's in a endowment fund to endow the educational program.  And we're now asking others to add to that endowment fund.  Because as each teacher comes in, they will have to be retrained, trained and so this is a continuous thing.  And it's going to put the State of Maryland on the map.

Speaker 1: What makes this museum [Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History & Culture, Baltimore, Maryland] different from other African American history museums?
Speaker 2: The educational program.  The fact that it's a living museum that is relevant and the fact that it is not governed totally by--it's not--white people are involved in this museum.  They have become interested and they understand that African American history is American history, and they want the truths told.  And anyone who's interested in the cultural and educational aspects of it would want to be a part of it.  And they see the potential to turn around the community.  And I spoke to the [National] Aquarium [Baltimore, Maryland] board and said two blocks from here we're planning this big zoo for the alligators, and two blocks the city's caving in.  And you're going to follow right with us unless we go out and get some attention to that community.  And I got two board members who are now raising contributions.  But--and that's why we're going statewide.  I'm very anxious--the [Maryland House of Delegates] appropriations committee is coming up on October the 1st and I don't know what the expectations are, but it's pretty low I guess.  And when they see this, it's, it's going to knock 'em out.  But they understand--but the whole secret to what we've been able to accomplish is that we were quiet.  And there's another side to it that I guess I don't want to discuss.  But I mean from where the opposition to us came from.  But it's, it's not only a beautiful museum, it's a living thing, and it's modern.  We--Verizon [Communications, Inc.] has donated all the equipment we need for distant learning.  So they have Internet No. 2 that's hooked up to all the schools.  So a person can sit at the museum and talk to 850,000 students at the same time.  We are--Comcast [Corporation] is putting in the Internet.  And we'll have an oral history section there.  We will have--we have an auditorium there for 250 people.  The most modern auditorium to exist because the--you press a button and the chairs and the floor all fold up into the wall and you then can have other activities.  The other aspects of it is--it's indescribable, at least for me, and it was done by two black architects, both of whom are fellows of the American Institute of Architecture [sic. American Institute of Architects], which is the highest award you can get.  And the--Phil Freelon from North Carolina, who was just inducted when they saw this design.  We're right next to The [Star-Spangled Banner] Flag House [Baltimore, Maryland], which is a national shrine.  And they are delighted to have us.  And what is unknown, which I'll tell you for the first time, is that now there's a member, a black member of the Sons of the American Revolution.  And it happens to be Mr. [Jean S.] Fugett, stepfather of Reginald [F.] Lewis.  They traced his family back to the Revolutionary War, it validated it.  And he's in it.  And no one has heard anything about it.  But the, the white man who is on the board told me about it.  And we're going to feature this at the museum.  We're going to feature so much about African Americans that are unknown.  And having been presented in the fashion that it should be professionally.  I mean a museum just shouldn't be about dead people and there's a statute and you look, it should be inspirational.  And we think that we can achieve this.
Speaker 1: And as a matter of fact, at one time you were told, or someone commented to you that black people don't have statues.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  That was the--[Governor William D.] Schaefer said that--we don't have anything.  And it's probably true.

Speaker 1: And tell me a little bit about--what is it that you hope--when people come to this museum [Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History & Culture, Baltimore, Maryland], what is it that you hope they will gain from their experience there, no matter who they are?
Speaker 2: They will gain an understanding of the history and culture of black people in America.  And understand that that's a part of American history, and that we ought to be recognized and be included.  For the blacks I want it to be a source of pride and information.  And I want the black kids in school to then bring their parents down and we'll make arrangements for them to go around.  Then they will bring others.  We are setting up a section, now that the museum is built, where we--to be in the public domain.  We're gonna--the portion of the year where we'll not have high visitors rates like in the summer, but in the winters, we're gonna do public programming and bring people in free to expose them to the museum.  We are training docents now and who will guide the museum.  We, we have bookings already for four, for this year the National Association of Architects has selected the museum.  And we told 'em the exhibits weren't there.  They said we wanna be there for the design so that they're gonna pay us fees and we had--we will entertain them, the legislature.  And they're booking for '05 [2005] and as far up as '09 [2009], the Kappas [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity] are supposed to try and bring their national convention here.  And this has helped because Reginald [F.] Lewis was a Kappa.  And--
Speaker 1: As are you.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: And on the board.

Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Judge [George] Russell when you look back at your life, what stands out the most to you and why?
Speaker 2: My family.  My son [George L. Russell, III] and my granddaughter [Madison Norma Ann Russell] and grandson [George L. Russell, IV].  The fact that my son is successful and he's, he's married and they are very, very happy.  And the--and I have two grandchildren who are precious to me.  And who I wanna sacrifice and provide for and hope to hand down those values as I received them.  And the thing that I'm proud most of is the way my son has conducted himself and my daughter-in-law [Devy Patterson Russell].  And how hard they work to sacrifice for their children and how much they understand that it's not the present that's important, it's the future.  And that their children must know Christ so that they will then know the right path.

Speaker 1: Yeah, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay. Okay, so 1980s.

Speaker 2: Name.
Speaker 1: Mamie, Mamie Short.  Mamie Dorsey [ph.] Short.
Speaker 2: Okay, about what year do you think that one was taken?
Speaker 1: That picture has to be forty or fifty years old.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you think 1950s maybe?
Speaker 1: No, no, earlier than that.  Because I--don't remember her.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: So maybe 1920s?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Early teens [1910s].
Speaker 1: No.  Yes, it could be, yes, '20s [1920s].
Speaker 2: Nineteen twenties [1920s], okay.
Speaker 1: That's a picture of all of my brothers and sisters.  And there are only three of us left.  My brother Charles [Russell], my sister Helen [Russell Quarles] and me.  All the others have passed.
Speaker 2: Can you just run through the names really quickly, [HistoryMaker] Judge [George] Russell, starting from left to right on the top row?
Speaker 1: The top row, that's Phyllis [Russell Brown], the other one is [Mary] Elaine [Russell], [Merrian] Celestine [Russell Gibson], Helen, Helen is the one who taught Reginald [F.] Lewis, and Catherine [Marie Robinson], the oldest who is the head librarian in Europe.  The--at the bottom on the left is my brother Charles, he's the youngest.  In the middle is my brother Louis [Bernard Russell], and me.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's a picture of me and my wife.
Speaker 2: And your wife's name?
Speaker 1: Marion [Ann Russell].
Speaker 2: Okay, and about what year was that one taken?
Speaker 1: It looks like it may have been at the Guardsmen's dance.  It's within the last five years.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  And you know what, Judge Russell, about what year was this one taken?
Speaker 1: Had to be in the '60s [1960s] because Catherine was there.  That's my mother and father.
Speaker 2: Okay, can you give us their names again?
Speaker 1: My father is George L. Russell, Sr.  My mother is Anna Marie Short [Russell].
Speaker 2: About what year was that one taken?
Speaker 1: I guess the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventies, [1970s], okay.
Speaker 1: That's a picture of my son George L. Russell, III, who's holding my grandson, George L. Russell, IV.  And the lady--my daughter-in-law, Devy Patterson Russell and my granddaughter, Madison [Norma Ann] Russell.
Speaker 2: Okay, about what year do you think that one was taken?  That looks pretty recent.
Speaker 1: Yes, well George is two now, so that was taken probably last year.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Twenty oh-three [2003].
Speaker 2: Okay.
