Speaker 1: I'd like to--we are going to start out by slating it--the interview.  My name is Julieanna Richardson and I'm the interviewer and Scott Stearns is the videographer, and Larry Crowe is observer.  And I'd like to have you start out by stating, stating your name and spelling it for us, including your middle name, and giving us your date of birth.
Speaker 2: Charles Rangel, R-A-N-G-E-L, June 11th, 1930.
Speaker 1: And can we have today's date and our location.
Speaker 2: I don't know what today is.
Speaker 1: It's July 22, [2003].
Speaker 2: Tuesday, and we're in the--
Speaker 1: 2000--
Speaker 2: Twenty three, 2003, we're in the Raven Building of the House of Representatives Room 2354 [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay, that's your office.  And I'd also like to have your profession.
Speaker 2: I'm a lawyer by training, a former federal prosecutor, former state legislator, member of the United States House of Representatives.
Story_ID: 125720
Speaker 1: And sir I ask five questions of everyone, they're a little People magazine-ish, very short answers.  Please bear with me.  I'd like to know what your favorite food is.
Speaker 2: I guess the American hot dog.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: I love all seasons, but I guess spring and fall are most comfortable.
Speaker 1: Favorite color?
Speaker 2: I guess red captures my imagination the most.
Speaker 1: And favorite vacation, place of vacation?
Speaker 2: Well I've been with my wife [Alma Rangel] over forty years and, and the biggest problem is that I don't know really what vacation truly means.  But getting away two or three days with a good book is all I need.
Speaker 1: And favorite phrase or saying, do you have one?
Speaker 2: I always say that I was shot and left for dead in Korea, November 30th, 1950.  And I prayed to God if he got me out of that mess, I wouldn't be a problem to anybody.  And I, I got out of it and I haven't had a bad day since.  And so no matter what happens in any given day I'm able to say I haven't had a bad since and it gets me through.  I guess another expression though, I never truly understood it and I may not now, but it works for me to say God is good because the fact that I know I have a problem, I can say God is good and think about it and I think about the blessings I have, the problem just seems smaller and smaller and smaller.  And I think that gets me by.
Story_ID: 125721
Speaker 1: Sir now I wanna start with--that was really nice--I wanna start with a discussion of your family and I'd like for you--your father, you didn't--did you know your, your father?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I knew him up until the time I was five or six years old, but he left the, the family.  I never really got to know him, but my mother's father was basically the one that ran the discipline and the direction of my mother's three kids.  And so to a large extent, we lived with him in Harlem [New York, New York].  But my brother, soon as he became seventeen, he joined the [U.S.] Army.  Soon as I became eighteen, I joined the Army so that the military in a sense turned our lives around.
Speaker 1: Give me your father's name.
Speaker 2: Ralph Rangel.
Speaker 1: Ralph Rangel, okay.  And do you know where he was from?
Speaker 2: Not really.  He came to New York [City] from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  Some said that he came from Puerto Rico and Latin America because the name itself is Hispanic.  But I've tried to track that down more often than not, with the many times I've gone to Puerto Rico.  But I haven't been able to determine a relative or any--even though there are many people with the name Rangel or Rangehalis [ph.] they call it.  Not only in Puerto Rico, but Central, South America and Mexico.  Strangely enough, it's not in Spain where most of the Spanish names originate.  And the reason I think for it is that it's in Portugal.  And so when they were sailing and discovering, you know, you know but slave names have always been a problem.  Most people don't realize that with the problem we're having today in Liberia, all of 'em have Anglo-Saxon names and some blacks don't understand that that's because when you're a slave, whoever buys you, gives you a name as well.
Story_ID: 125722
Speaker 1: Now your mother, can you talk about her and her background and her name?  Blanche was the name.
Speaker 2: Blanche Wharton.  As a matter of fact, just last week I received a family tree from one of my distant cousins, Clifton Wharton, who was Deputy [U.S.] Secretary of State, and his dad [Clifton Reginald Wharton, Sr.] who was the first black ambassador that we ever had, to Norway.  But they all came from Accomack, Virginia, and the slave masters and all of that generations back.  And with my great-great-grandfather, he had fourteen kids.  And that's where they just scattered, all heading north, nobody went south of Virginia.  And my grandfather, that is my mother's father, went from Accomack to [New] Jersey to New York, where he had my mother and my uncle.  And then my grandmother died in childbirth when my mom was two.  But he stuck it out and raised the two kids himself, by himself in New York.  And while he wasn't trained, he eventually became an elevator operator in the criminal court building.  His Civil Service exam he would jokingly say was lifting weights because at that time the elevator was operated by pulling heavy cords, ropes.
Story_ID: 125723
Speaker 1: I never knew when I went to the VA [Veterans Administration, now U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs] out of clear frustration that they said I couldn't go to college.  They said I didn't have enough time since I had to complete high school.  But what I knew that I was going to win and they were asking me just what I wanted to be, I didn't have the slightest clue.  And the, the, the evaluation, the occupation, the examination that was taken, they interpreted that I should have been an electrician or mortician.  And they tried to explain it because it would take less time.  But they never asked me what was it I wanted to be.  And I didn't have the slightest idea; all I knew is that I wanted to get out of the streets and I said lawyer so fast and stuck with it, and it took me a long time to figure out why would I have said that until I realized that my grandfather who I admired so much, and wanted him to care for me so much 'cause he didn't think I was gonna amount to anything anyway.  He was the elevator in the criminal court building, and he just took up lawyers and judges and district attorneys.  And I think I wanted to get even with him and show him what I could be, being an elevator operator.  But in any event, it was the best decision I've made in my life.
Story_ID: 125724
Speaker 1: Sir, can you describe your grandfather a little bit?  What kind of man was he?
Speaker 2: He was a very complex individual.  He never had much training, but he knew early that he wasn't gonna stay on the farm.  And in raising my mom [Blanche Wharton] and her brother, it was a pretty rough life, being a waiter, being a Pullman porter, being an elevator operator.  And he was a very, very strong disciplinarian and he would not know how to say I love you if, if his life depended on it.  But there was ways that he could curse you out and you knew it was love and, and it didn't seem as pleasant when it was occurring.  But I guess my sister who he raised completely from childhood, and my brother who he tried to just deal when he was born, who I, who I lost in 1974.  And he was kind of stuck with me since I lived there when I was going through school.  And even though he teased that I wouldn't be a success, the teasing in a sense was an encouragement.  And nothing made him more proud than when I became an acting district attorney in the very building that he was an elevator operator.  I, I guess I, I remember the only thing that I found so loving that brought me to tears was that when I was graduating from New York University [New York, New York], being a veteran and, and older than most of the kids, these milestones really didn't mean that much to me because I had so much further to go.  So getting out of high school wasn't exciting when you're twenty-four years old and graduating from college when you're twenty-seven.  But I had this invitation and there's no one I wanted to go more than to see it and to be a part of it, than my grandfather.  And he asked me, "Why in the hell would I wanna go down to see you graduate?"  And I said, "Well it's not that important to me either if you don't wanna go."  And so I went down I guess the fellas, they were gonna have a couple of beers after, but I went down.  And when I got home that night, my grandfather was dressed up like Billy Be Damn, downstairs in the kitchen, drunk as hell, asking where the hell have I been.  And I was looking at him, the derby and the spats and the vest, and I said where have I been, where the hell have you been?  And he told me that he went down there looking for me and god damn you didn't tell me that there were 7,000 white folks down there.  How in the hell do you expect me to find you?  And I was so happy that he cared enough to try to do it, but just for the invitation, it would have been impossible.  So it was smaller things than that caused us to communicate, but he, he was a hardworking man and, and even after he retired, he got a job around the corner in a hardware store and he worked until the day he died.  Work, work, work was, was all that he knew, all that he enjoyed.  And he had a way of sharing his experiences with you and trying to act a lot more tough than he was.  And we had our major problems, more than, than my brother and sister because, because of the closeness that I had to my mother.
Story_ID: 125725
Speaker 1: And my mom [Blanche Wharton] and I were really stuck with each other, we looked almost exactly alike and, and she used to tease.  You can say or do what you want, but you can't deny I'm your mother, you know.  So we had--my mom had a great sense of humor and, and on balance I don't have a complaint in the world.
Speaker 2: Tell me about--what was your mother like also?  Can you describe her?
Speaker 1: My mom was a very dependent lady and she got married I guess she was sixteen or seventeen and, and being raised without a mother really I think had a strong impact on her.  And she had a pretty rough life.  No one loved her kids more than she, but not being able to raise them and being so dependent on her father and her father being so authoritative, and always raising his voice.  And yet whenever any of us went to protect our mother, she would say mind your business.  But sometimes he would do it just to tease us, that he could do it; that was his daughter and--but she and I, we, we, we did so many things together.  And I used to just take her around when I became a member of [U.S.] Congress to, to different meetings and she thoroughly enjoyed living through me as I did through she.  And, and we got to know each other better I guess after I got out of school.  But I, I always told my Jewish friends you ain't seen no Jewish mother till you met mine, cause she lost her sight when I became her eyes and, and I, I, I was so lucky to marry a woman that understood the relationship that I had with my brother and my mom and tolerant it seems to me now that she was.  But my mom and I got along.
Story_ID: 125726
Speaker 1: Now give me your siblings' names.  Your older brother--
Speaker 2: Ralph, Ralph [Rangel], yeah he, he was my best friend.  And for many, many years we shared the same bed and it's a strange thing about life, though.  I guess we argued as much as any other brothers would, but I don't remember one of those arguments now.  He went into the Army in 1948 [sic 1941] before the war.  And then he came out in '45 [1945].  I was fifteen, but he and I became buddies.  He belonged to my gang, I belonged to his group of friends.  And even though it was a seven years difference, nobody until the day he died, ever considered him the older brother or me the younger brother.  We didn't look alike, but we thought alike.  And it broke his heart when I ran off into the service.  But when I came out, I didn't intend to come out, really.  I, I intended to re-enlist and become a recruiting sarge; I had a chest full of medals.  We were the first ones back from Korea and, and after the war the Army was pretty good to me, just walking around and encouraging people to fight communism.  But I, I got out and that's when I found out I really wasn't a big shot, I was just another high school dropout.  And with my brother's encouragement, we put together the pieces and I never had--I remember once had an argument with my wife [Alma Rangel] and, and she said you know your whole life is political.  You, you, you just don't have friends, you have just politicians around you all the time.  And in anger I said you know I don't need friends, I got my brother.  And when he was dying of kidney failure, he came to live with me and my wife.  And she became his sis--his nurse.  She was, she knew the love I--I can't thank her enough to this day for allowing me to share the last weeks, months and years with my beloved brother.  But he, he--people have no problem reminding me just how much smarter and how much more personality that he had.  And even though he never--he married instead of going to school and gave me two wonderful nephews and a niece.  But he was one of a kind.  And if you had to have a best friend, he was my backup.
Speaker 1: And how many--how much older was he?
Speaker 2: Seven years.
Speaker 1: Seven years.  So when you said he went into the service, you were--you said 1948.
Speaker 2: Forty-one [1941].  I went in '48 [1948].
Speaker 1: Okay.  You said '48 [1948], so I just wanted to clarify.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, yes, no.
Story_ID: 125727
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when--tell me your other sibling.  So were you--
Speaker 2: My sister.  She's three years younger and I kind of think too that she, she had a lot to do with me going back to school.  I mean she was nothing but a kid sister.  I mean a kid sister, tattle tale, get you in trouble type of sister.  And when I came home from the service thinking I was a big shot, I can't tell you the pride I had in her.  She was going to nursing school; you couldn't get her out of that starched uniform.  They wore uniforms when they were students.  I think the only thing they couldn't wear was the hat which identified which nursing school you went through.  And in our family--(interruption)--didn't have anybody that had gone to college.  And so she was really the, the pioneer in higher education.  She had gone to Washington Irving High School [New York City, New York] and we were just so proud of her.  And I guess subconsciously I couldn't have a kid sister you know, doing better than a high school dropout older brother.  But we are so close now.  We, we, we go out together; we talk about the old days and she's a wonderful woman, a great mother, great sister.
Speaker 1: And her name?
Speaker 2: Frances Rangel McDermott.
Story_ID: 125728
Speaker 1: Now what is your--yeah--earliest memory of growing up?  If you think back.
Speaker 2: I, I don't know what is earlier.  There's been some rough times as a kid.  I remember grandfather bringing us food when we were hungry, bringing oil, kerosene, burning when there was no heat, where we were staying.  Most often than not if there was--if we were in trouble, grandfather was always there to, to help out.  I--my life on Lenox Avenue [Harlem, New York] was one of the most exciting educations that I can think of.  I was working when I was eight years old, but it was running errands.  But I was raised on Lenox Avenue working.  I knew everybody on Lenox.  I worked in the drugstore, in the hardware store, I delivered groceries.
Story_ID: 125729
Speaker 1: And I remember so clearly when after I got out of law school and I was a federal prosecutor and I got actively involved in a club.  And J. Raymond Jones, whose picture is on my wall all over New York [New York City, New York], was the first African American Democratic county leader.  And he sent for me and he, he says I understand young man that you're interested in running for party office and I was so scared I didn't know what to do.  I'd never been in, in, in front of a, a powerful political figure like that.  And I don't think I was lying.  I, I think I was telling him all the support I had for this particular office that he was prepared to support me for because the person that I would be running against was opposing him.  And he said he liked to talk with my supporters, who I kind of exaggerated, no I didn't.  I said that if he were to support me, I would have a lot more people, much like so many of the people tell me today.  He says well I'd like to meet these people.  All I had was a one room basement apartment.  It had a sofa and a chair.  Now how in the hell could I invite anyone down there?  And so I went on Lenox Avenue and told my buddies, Charlie Freed [ph.], what the hell do I do now?  The county leader is prepared to meet with me and my followers.  I don't know what.  He says well, we'll do something about it.  And dammit to hell, we converted the undertaker parlor into a meeting room.  The grocery store guy Sam Broad [ph.], made sandwiches and hors d'oeuvres and had cold cuts.  Sam Freed [ph.] came and he was my white waiter providing drinks for everybody.  I had the whole gang put on shirt and ties, from Lenox Avenue, and fill the room.  And it was all of my childhood experiences that, that I treasured that just followed me, as they followed me going through school.  And when so many people say it must have been the struggle, when you have so many people pulling for you and they had so few people coming from Lenox Avenue, from, from my block.
Story_ID: 125730
Speaker 1: I remember that when I was appointed as an Assistant U.S. Attorney by Robert Kennedy, I had no idea that I had to be investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation [FBI].  And when I thought all of the things I had done as a teenager and in the [U.S.] Army, I said, "Well so much for the appointment."  And when they asked me for references, there was nobody in the neighborhood, I mean the most respected person was the number runner and I knew I couldn't put his name down.  But there was a fellow in law school that I befriended, Ned Frank, his father was a civil court judge.  I asked him could I put his father down since I had studied in his house; I knew his father.  He says of course.  And when the father called me down to the chambers to tell me that he shouldn't be talking with me about it, but that the FBI was having a problem with me, I knew that my past had swiftly caught up with me and I asked what was the problem.  And he said it's where you live; you've got to tell 'em where you really lived.  I said judge I got a lot of problems, but where I live isn't one of the problems.  He says I shouldn't be talking with you, but I'm just letting you know that the FBI's having a problem where you live.  I got on the subway and I wondered what were these white folks up to now.  They must be out to get me.  How could they possibly say it's where I live?  I got off on 35th Street and Lenox Avenue [Harlem, New York], I walked south down to 32nd and there were all the guys from the block looking at me asking me what the hell have I done?  What trouble was I in that the FBI had been looking for me for two weeks.  And they told him not only they didn't know me, but they had knocked on every door in the block to let people know that nobody knew Charlie Rangel.  I just couldn't believe that they had done it.
Speaker 2: We're gonna change tapes.  That's a wonderful story.  They were protecting you.
Speaker 1: No question.  Some of them would see me and they'd say, "What is it they say that you're doing now?"  I said, "I'm a federal prosecutor."  They said, "You're a federal prosecutor?  Good, that's good.  You take care of yourself Charlie, you know, good to see you."  And--just getting out of high school in that block was quite a thing.
Story_ID: 127193
Speaker 1: Congressman, I'd like to take you back to the block that you were--now were you--how many different places did you live?
Speaker 2: Wherever I lived it was because of some problems with my mother [Blanche Wharton] and her father, I always came back.  I lived--once my mother went and she did what they call day's worker in upstate New York at a resort area.  And she used to get angry at me for saying that because she, she later spent twenty-five years in the union and she always told me, always told me I was a union member, I don't work in a factory instead of day's work, you know.  Don't get political with your mother.  But, but once when she went away, she had me to stay with her brother.  And like his father, he was an elevator operator.  Matter of fact, in the State Building which was right next door to the Criminal Court Building.  And he didn't drink a glass of beer during the day or during the week.  But he was a weekend alcoholic.  But his wife, my Aunt Mariah, was one of the most beautiful, caring people that I ever met.  So between his abuse and her love, I survived.  But, but he lived in the Bronx [New York] in a Jewish neighborhood.  And he never socialized at all, but they put me in a, in a school, I was the only black in the class.  And I really think that, that that's where I got the strongest academic foundation because when I went back to PS 89, I was the toughest, smartest bum kid in the class.  Troublemaker, but, but I had teachers that followed me from PS 89, incidentally, my mother went to PS 89 and my uncle went to PS 89, and I live on the same block now where PS 89 is.  So I never really--I tell people that I was born and raised on 32nd Street and Lenox Avenue, then I became big shot and moved uptown and now I live on 35th and Lenox Avenue.  But those teachers really thought I was a genius as a result of the two years that I got out of those Bronx public schools.  And you know it's a strange thing about life and education.  If you start off on a roll, it's kind of hard--if, if you're ahead of the game, you get more support than you deserve.  And teachers tend to give attention to those they thought would succeed.  And they thought I was gonna make it.  When I dropped out of high school, I broke a lot of my teachers' heart.  But unfortunately when a kid is not making it and needs help the most, a lot of teachers don't wanna be associated with that.  But I think those two years in the Bronx--but other than that, all I know is Harlem [New York].
Story_ID: 127194
Speaker 1: I think sometimes my ambitions have been curtailed by only knowing Harlem [New York].  I--my wife [Alma Rangel] and I have been married over forty years and she's from Florida.  And she thinks that we should retire in Florida.  I, I cannot imagine a doctor telling me that my life would be extended if I lived in Florida.  Me saying how much time have I got in Harlem, you know because it could be a fear, it could be love.  But no matter what it is, when you asked earlier about a vacation, I can't be away from this, this Harlem of mine for more than three or four days without wanting to be there.  And I breathe it, I live it, I know what it was for my grandfather telling me from the turn of the century.  I know what it's meant to me.  I know what Adam [Clayton] Powell [Jr.], my predecessor, how he turned it around.  And I know that history has allowed me to be a part of two congress people that have served this community for well over half a century, which is historic in the [U.S.] House of Representatives.  And I know when I leave, we ain't seen nothing yet for this community that is located in the middle of the greatest island in the world, Manhattan Island, and the greatest city of the world [New York City].  And, and we keep coming.  And so I haven't lived outside of this; not physically and certainly not mentally.  Of course it has its drawbacks when my wife looks lovingly--
Speaker 2: (Unclear)
Speaker 1: Yeah, my wife [Alma Rangel] looks lovingly into my eyes and says how much she admires me, but I just don't have any class.  And I remind her that that was the reason I married her.  I don't need a lot of it; and I certainly don't need it in the House of Representatives, unfortunately.
Story_ID: 127195
Speaker 1: Now sir, I'd like to take you back to the Harlem [New York] of your youth.  And I'd like you to describe what sights, smells and sounds remind you of growing up on Lenox Avenue.  What, what, what those--if you would just sort of think back.
Speaker 2: Well a lot of it had to do with survival.  I, I remember going to the Armory in order to, to get the surplus foods and pray that it was dried fruits so that we can eat half of it on the way home.  Of course all the kids were there.  I remember the rough time in, in terms of, of, of now knowing the kids of the fathers that--I mean we had a lot of black establishments then.  The, the shoe, the shoe repair man, his, his son became a very well known minister in Harlem who recently died.  But he remembered me as a kid because that's where all of us bought our shoes, those that were leftover-- strike that, those that were not picked up.  And those shoes looked so good.  Brand new leather soles and shined all up.  We--in, in the schools we used to do a lot of field trips which they don't do now.  And that got us out of Harlem to the zoos, to the aquariums and to the, to the museums.  A lot of it wasn't pleasant, we had street fights, but we had gangs that, that loved each other.  I had a really a, a dual life in the sense that the hoodlums between 5th and Lenox were a lot rougher than the gang I belonged to between 7th and 8th.  All along 32nd Street, but, but I was a Catholic and an altar boy and a saint sometimes, but we used to get picked up by the cops on the other block and it was always confusing when the guys from Lenox Avenue came to rob the guys from 7th, 8th Avenue and I was in the gang.  And they told me I'd had to make up my mind 'cause this was confusing as to which side I was on.  And, and I must have been a hell of a good politician then because, because everything really, truly worked out.
Story_ID: 127196
Speaker 1: I guess a lot of the things that, that I acquired and didn't know it on Lenox Avenue [Harlem, New York], made me probably the best, best clerk the Hotel Theresa ever had.  And of course knowing I wasn't gonna spend my life there helped.  But Ron Brown--well Bill Brown was the manager and Ron Brown the Secretary of State [sic, Secretary of Commerce], lived there.  People ask how do I get along with Ron Brown.  I say as a kid he was the boss's son, how do you get along with the boss's son?  But his dad was a big gambler and I worked the late shift and I was a big gopher.  And I'd gopher anything they wanted, and made a lot of sense in dollars and cents to me.  But I'm trying to write a book to try to figure out how does this all fit in because every day that you live is history, but you're just not aware of it.  And I, I never thought I brought anything to the [U.S.] Army; I just needed so much.  But clearly I did, and getting out of the Army, I didn't know what the heck I would do.  I felt like some of the prisoners who serve time, what do you do now?  But clearly the experiences in the Army and the experiences on Lenox Avenue, even though they were not the typical American's experiences, were able to be molded to something positive.
Speaker 2: Now when you were at the Hotel Theresa, how old were you?  You were older, though.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was twenty-seven.
Speaker 2: Twenty-seven, I thought--
Story_ID: 127197
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: But I, I'm wondering, you know you talk about you know the hardware store that you--what was the name of the hardware?
Speaker 1: Lincoln Hardware [Harlem, New York], Model Drugstore, Sam Broad [ph.], I don't know what he called his grocery store, but next door was Eddie's Pork Store.  And boy when I delivered cosmetics to the dancing girls at the, at the, the Rendezvous [Elk's Rendezvous, Harlem, New York], and they wouldn't have any clothes on, it was terrible.  I was bringing stuff when they didn't even order it, you know, but they liked me and I liked them.  And I'd say "Hey doc, you sure they don't need any more cosmetics over there?"  'Cause we had the show biz cosmetics just for them.  And that was a pleasure.  And then I imagine telling all those kids at PS 89 [New York City, New York] how much those girls loved me and you know, it was a good life, good life.
Story_ID: 127198
Speaker 1: Junior High School 139 [New York City, New York], that was much further up--
Speaker 2: Now elementary school was what?
Speaker 1: PS 89 [New York City, New York].
Speaker 2: PS 89, okay.  Did you have any teachers there that you particularly cared about or liked or--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Ms. Thomas.  But Ms. Messinger [ph.], I'm in touch with her daughter in, in Los Angeles [California].  As a matter of fact, I went to Mrs. Messinger's funeral about ten years ago.  And she stayed with me even staying at my house here when I was a member of [U.S.] Congress.  She encouraged me to draw, to do art, to write.  I don't know how in the heck she could tolerate a guy like me, but it's really strange though, so many people said they knew when I was a kid that I was gonna be successful.  When I knew a lot of 'em thought that I was gonna end up in jail.  And the nuns get so carried away with it spiritually that they tell people they instructed me, when they wouldn't let me anywhere near those Catholic girls when they were going to school because going to public school just automatically meant you were a heathen.  And in my case they were closer to the truth.  But we had a nice--a lot of nice, square kids in public school.  I wasn't one of 'em but, but they just hated anybody in public school, those nuns.  You could make it with the priest, but I see Mother Superior now and she says how proud she is of me and how she always knew.  Take what you get.
Speaker 2: Now what--in elementary school, was there any other thing--let me ask you.  What were you like, though?  What was, what were you like as a--
Speaker 1: I talked a lot and, and I stayed in trouble and, and the only thing that kept me straight was that they would threaten to have my mother [Blanche Wharton] to come to school.  And that would be the end of the day if my grandfather knew that my mother couldn't work because of going to school.  But I don't know how I stayed in, in so much trouble, I really don't.  And at that time we didn't have a lot of civil rights in terms of police contact.  And so the number of times I've been picked up and taken to the precinct.  But more often than not, they knocked the hell out and send you home or worse still to call your parents.  But that was the end of it; you didn't get fingerprinted, you didn't get arrested, you know, and you really didn't want anyone to know.  And the worse thing in the world was to get caught in that police car, you know, being kicked out in front of your house.  But that's what I thought the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] was gonna pick up.  You know since that time, I lost all respect for the FBI.  But you know there's no records of, of anything like that.

Speaker 1: So now when you--you're just saying you were mischievous in the streets where your, your--you spent a lot of time in the streets.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause the statute of limitations had run out on most of those things now anyway. (laughter)
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So, so well what, what was the first time--I mean how old were you when you first got in trouble with the police, do you know where you--you said you were working at eight.
Speaker 2: I was working, but there would be places that the kids would hang out.  There would number places.  But we weren't into the numbers, but just hanging out on the street would get you in a lot of trouble.  Talking back to the police would get in a lot of trouble; you were afraid to talk back to the police.  But you had to show the boys that you didn't give a damn about the police and, and the police had to make certain they let you know that they were completely in charge.  Every rogue cop knew me, you know as a smart guy, a wise guy.  And that didn't help me with my grandfather.  My god he, he was a tough little man, but--and he got into trouble with the police himself.  But he sure didn't wanna get in trouble with the police because of me.  And he thought it was kind of intimidating that police would tell him what I was doing, you know in the street.  But I had all these Jewish merchants telling him how smart I was, you know in terms of when I was working and what I was doing, and--
Story_ID: 127200
Speaker 1: I remember once in working in the drug store, I guess I was ten years old.  And this woman was asking--it was a drug store that was split.  It had a, a, a luncheon type of cafeteria counter on one side and the pharmaceutical drug store on the other.  They don't' have those today, but they used to.  So the pharmacist, Doc, he was always on the other side flirting with the waitresses and, and I could take care of everything except ringing it up on the register.  I would get everything and he'd come over and take the money.  And this lady was asking me for a sanitary napkins, I told her we didn't have any napkins.  She said yes you do, they're wrapped up separately.  I said "Miss, I've been working here."  She says "Can I talk to the doctor?"  I said "You don't talk to the doctor for napkins", you know.  I said "Doc, do you have any clean napkins?  You know, sanitary ones, clean napkins lady wants."  And the lady almost ran out the store.  And that's my first lesson I got about don't do that, you know 'bout napkins.  But I, I did pretty good by my grandfather in terms of the merchants.  It was just the other part of me.
Speaker 2: Now what was the name of that drug Store?
Speaker 1: It was the Model Drug Store [Harlem, New York], M-O-D-E-L, on the corner.  Guy's name was King that ran it.
Story_ID: 127201
Speaker 1: I was hitch--I was on the back of a trolley hitch-hiking a ride on the back of a trolley with a bunch of kids.  Trolley ran up 135th Street [New York City, New York], school was on 35th [135th] Street.  So we always jumped on the trolley for a ride going back and forth because the girls' school was on the other side on 35th [135th] Street.  So we'd take the trolley to go up to the girls' school.  And a cop pulled up when the trolley stopped on 7th Avenue and the guy jumped out the car and grabbed me and said he was a detective and he was gonna take me to the precinct for riding the trolley.  And I begged him not to do it and he says well, where do you live?  I told him where I lived.  And I had on short pants.  And he started rubbing my leg, you know in the car.  And the precinct was between 7th and 8th Avenue, a block away.  And he was driving away from the precinct.  And I could look at his face and see something was wrong.  And I got out of that car and I ran home.  And this wasn't a police car.  When my grandfather got home from work, he said that the school had reported and I was taken by car by some people, what happened.  And I told my grandfather what happened and he cursed me out for being on the trolley, cursed me out for getting in the car, cursed me out for not calling the police and I'm telling him I thought the guy was a cop.  And by the time my grandfather got finished with me, I was sorry that I had told him.  But I was walking down Lenox Avenue several months after that and my grandfather's a little short guy like my mom [Blanche Wharton].  And this guy was a big, tall cop looking type of guy.  And I said grandfather don't get angry and don't cuss me out, but that's the guy.  And my grandfather lashed into him, cursing him out and chasing him down the street.  I never felt so proud of my grandfather.  And it turned out that this guy had a church and--well that's another story.  Statute of limitations had run out on him.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But how old were you when that incident happened?  I'm just trying to--
Speaker 1: Less than twelve.
Speaker 2: Okay less than twelve, okay.  But you were in junior high at that point.
Speaker 1: No, no, no this is PS 89 [New York City, New York].
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Not junior high--I never, no, I was more sophisticated then.
Story_ID: 127202
Speaker 1: Okay.  So now what age were you when you went to, to junior high?
Speaker 2: Twelve to probably let's see you was supposed to get twelve to fifteen.
Speaker 1: And are your friends changing around junior high or they still your--you're still seeing neighborhood friends and who were your friends?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's an interesting story and it'll take too long to tell you now.  But the combination of friends that, that I had in 1944 and '45 [1945], we've gotten together every year since then.  We used to call ourselves twenty year friends, thirty year friends, forty year friends.  We've actually become fifty year friends.  And some made it, some didn't, some went to jail, some went to school.  Unfortunately, too many have died.  We just buried one of 'em.  Two couldn't make it because they had strokes.  But we would have an annual poker game, more often than not I would bring it together.  We couldn't really stay with each other for more than two or three--we say we weren't gonna do it the next year, but, but it was really a combination we thought of what Harlem [New York] was all about.  We started off giving dances when we were fourteen and fifteen years old.  We gave a big dance at the Congress Casino, we had a band and everything, no one showed up, it rained.  The guy threatened us, we said we're kids you know, what are you gonna do?  Then we gave dances at the church.  We learned from the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association].  They used to charge so we figured if they can do it and we were in charge, why couldn't we do our own?  And we did it.  We, we formed a club, a social club.  And we've stayed together all of those years.  And so we never let either forget who we are.
Speaker 1: Now what was the name of the club you formed?
Speaker 2: Les Garcons, "The Boys".  And we used to tell the girls if they supported us, we would introduce them to the social world.
Speaker 1: That's a French name, Les Garcons.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  One guy went to Bronx High School of Science [The Bronx, New York].  He was so proud of himself that he could speak French, what the hell did we know?  So we figured no one would know who we were and they had such weird sounding names for the other clubs, so we just figured they would not know.  We were internationalists, you know.
Speaker 1: Now who were these friends?  Who were some of their names?
Speaker 2: Well Arthur Barnes, he's Vice President of HIP [Health Plan of New York] now, he worked for an insurance company.  Earl Davis, he's--became a famous basketball player.  He went to--and a professor at NYU [New York University], retired.  (Unclear) Williams was a CPA [Certified Public Accountant].  He recently passed away.  Norman Howard became a police officer, retired, he passed away.  My buddy, Guy Gyton [ph.], he was a bus driver and supervisor, dispatcher.  He lives in Virginia.  Trevor Banister, well known Harlem sportsman.  He's around.  Like I said, we lost a lot, Marshall, Marshall White [ph.].  He, he had a mental breakdown, but he's still around and he's still with us.  Henry Courtland [ph.], he died but his brother Billy is still with us.  So it's a cross-section of who we were as kids that just happened to tolerate each other as adults.
Story_ID: 127203
Speaker 1: Now the social clubs, can you describe what they were about, sort of in historical context?
Speaker 2: Well they're all different kinds.  Some were athletic clubs and mainly basketball that would have the jerseys for identification.  Others were just hoodlums that had territories and zip guns we didn't use too many knives then, but they would protect the women and try and make a couple of dollars from kids in school.  Ours was more social.  We had guys that were on the football team.  We had one guy that was a swimming ace.  But if you really wanted to know what our main thrust was socially, it would be girls.  And one of our members Barry Best had this uncle that was a number runner.  And he had a nice apartment that he used during the day, but it was ours in the evening and the weekends.  So we had our own clubhouse.  And we did quite well, we, we were okay.  Life was good.  Matter of fact, a lot of guys married some of their, their childhood girlfriends.  Now I don't think we knew anybody that had gotten divorces, but these girls when we have our reunions many, many years ago, would always be the, the--do what women do and to talk about old times and to fix our food and then when we finished playing poker, we'd spend some time with them or go somewhere.  But when they started changing wives, it didn't work.  So we had to go back to our old stag thing because the, the old wives weren't receptive to the new wives and so--but even now a lot of the wives are still friendly.  And every funeral or every--on a more positive note--every wedding of a child or childbirth of a grandchild brings us together and it's really more often than not a reunion.
