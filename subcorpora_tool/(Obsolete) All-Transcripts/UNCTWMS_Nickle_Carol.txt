Joey Fink: It&#8217;s August 13, 2010. I&#8217;m in Knoxville, Tennessee, with Carol Nickle. Carol, the first question I&#8217;d like to ask is for you to tell me a little bit about where you&#8217;re from and where you grew up and how you ended up in eastern Tennessee.
Carol Nickle: Okay. Well I was born in Greensboro, North Carolina and grew up there. In fact my senior year of high school was the same year that the sit-ins occurred at Woolworth&#8217;s in Greensboro, in 1960, and while I was in high school Josephine [Boyd] Clark, who was an African American, a young woman, was the one person who integrated Greensboro Senior High, so those things really stand out in my mind. I actually came to Knoxville to go to law school but I came to Tennessee because of my husband. Went to Duke University and met Bill Nickle there, who was in the divinity school, and he was assigned a church in Tennessee. We moved back and forth from Tennessee to Winston-Salem, North Carolina and then came back. So that&#8217;s what brought me to Tennessee in the first place and then we moved to Knoxville in order for me to go to law school, and I had been out of college for nine years when I started law school.
JF: So you graduated Duke in 1964?
CN: Actually I accelerated in order to get married so I graduated in 1963.
JF: Excellent. How was it talked about in your family or amongst your peers, the Greensboro sit-ins and the events occurring around that time?
CN: It really wasn&#8217;t talked about. My dad was a pediatrician and pretty well known in Greensboro and I mean he treated the African American kids and white kids both. But I don&#8217;t remember it being talked about and actually I feel pretty bad about this because I was president of the student body that senior year and I was pretty ignorant of what was going on and really didn&#8217;t try to bring the student body forward and participate, so those are things that I feel like I missed out on. I mean I was trying to get the administration to agree for us to have another May Day [Laughs] instead of knowing about the sit-ins and really trying to push the student body along in that way.
JF: You were pushing for a May Day celebration--
CN: Yeah.
JF: --around issues of class and--?
CN: No, no, just the traditional May Day. [Laughs]
JF: Oh, okay. [Laughs]
CN: No, it was not political at all. [Laughs]
JF: What did you major in as an undergrad at Duke?
CN: I majored in religion, and actually the thing that spurred me to go to law school was becoming involved with the League of Women Voters in Kingsport, Tennessee, and pushing there for an open housing ordinance with the city council over racial issues because there were African American PhDs who were moving to Kingsport and it was a very segregated town. That&#8217;s where Tennessee Eastman was and Holston Ordnance was another industry and so they didn&#8217;t really have a choice as to where they could live. They had to go to the one little section where the black people in Kingsport lived. So I got involved in that. We formed a coalition with the League of Women Voters and some other groups to push for an open housing ordinance, which didn&#8217;t happen while we were there but we got it started. So then that pushed me to want to go to law school, and I had also been involved working in a black ghetto in Winston-Salem with some children while we were there earlier. So I really went to law school at age thirty thinking I could change the world, and I should have known better. [Laughs] But that&#8217;s what took me to law school.
JF: Was your husband supportive of your decision to go to law school?
CN: Oh yeah. We moved here. He got a job in Knoxville in order for me to go to law school.
JF: Had you started a family at that point or was that in the plans?
CN: Yeah, both of the children had been born by then. In fact Chris, our youngest, he was like three or four. They were born in 1964 and &#8217;68, so.
JF: Do you think it was unusual for you to be going back to school as a mother, a thirty-year-old mother of two, to get her law degree, or were there other women that you knew that were doing similar things? Can you give me a sense of how typical or not that decision would have been at the time?
CN: I started law school, I believe it was in the summer of 1971, and there were seven women at the University of Tennessee [UT] here in Knoxville who started law school that summer and including us there were only eleven women in the law school, so we were a very small group but then that fall more women started and each year the percentage increased. But at that time the female law students on the average were older than the males and there were several who were as old as I was or older. I was in school at the same time with Dorothy Stulberg, who you should also talk with, and she was in her early forties. So there were other women who were as old as I was but most of the men were younger. A lot of the men were just right out of college.
JF: What was the treatment like as a woman?
CN: Well we had a really close knit active group of women law students, it was called Law Women, and because we were such a small group--and I cannot remember the size of the student body. I&#8217;d have to look that up. But we were a very small percentage of the law school and we pushed for some changes. We pushed for I think a directory that didn&#8217;t have pictures in it. I remember there was one visiting professor, who was in for I think it was a tort class, just drew--and he didn&#8217;t mean anything by it, but he drew a picture of a naked woman in a bathtub to illustrate something and Law Women complained about that and he apologized and that didn&#8217;t happen anymore. We did push for some changes as far as just the outward attitude in the classes and how women were treated in law school, but I don&#8217;t remember anything really blatant or hateful towards us at all.
JF: Was UT integrated at this point, the law school?
CN: Yes, but there were very few black students, even fewer than women.
JF: Were there any black women in your cohort or in the law school while you were there?
CN: I don&#8217;t remember that there were any but I&#8217;m sure that there probably were who came in after me, and certainly there are now, but at that time the women in my class were all white, I believe.
JF: So you said you went to law school with the idea that you were going to change the world.
CN: To do civil rights work and--yeah. [Laughs] And I should have known better. [Laughs]
JF: [Laughs] What was your sense of what was possible at that point as far as the path you would take to initiate the kind of change you were hoping to see?
CN: Well I wanted to do civil rights law, I wanted to do constitutional law. I was really interested in racial equality at that point and became more interested in gender equality [Laughs] as I got more into it. I did a directed research for a professor, John Sobieski, on Title VII, which is the federal discrimination law, and his wife is the one, Wanda Sobieski, who is an attorney who has done a lot of work on women&#8217;s issues. I wrote a paper on Title VII, which prohibits gender and race discrimination and discrimination based on other protected classes too. That really got me interested in the whole area of racial and gender discrimination, especially in employment.
JF: And did that become your focus?
CN: That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been doing mostly for the last twenty years, and I started off right outside of law school. After I finished law school I worked in the legal clinic, which was Legal Services, representing poor people, and then I went from there to the Department of Interior because I also really care about the environment and this was enforcing the federal coal Surface Mining Act. There were some friends of mine working there and it was a newly implemented regulation, a fairly new statute, Jimmy Carter was President, and it was just a great time to be working in that area. Then Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980 and put James Watt in as Secretary of the Interior and he&#8217;s the attorney who had represented the group to try to get the Surface Mining Act held unconstitutional. They settled a case out from under me in Washington allowing an operator to leave a high wall, which was illegal, and pay a fine, so I resigned immediately. [I] then started working with a group in a case against TVA [Tennessee Valley Authority] concerning rate payer issues and when that was over, I got some funding with a friend to open a law office and work with the Legal Environmental Assistance Foundation which was an environmental law firm. I did that for about a year and a half and then just totally went into private practice after that. My private practice has kind of evolved into civil rights, constitutional issues, and employment discrimination and whistle blowing, and now I have cut way back on my practice and moved my office home, it will be two years in October, and I&#8217;m really just doing employment now. It&#8217;s just a few cases. But for the last twenty years or so it was almost entirely employment discrimination and whistle blower with a few constitutional cases here and there. [Laughs]
JF: How do you see the issues of gender and racial justice overlapping in the [19]70s?
CN: That&#8217;s a really good question. I think in a lot of ways we were working on both issues at the same time, there wasn&#8217;t necessarily an overlap of the same people working on both issues, but I think it goes back historically to the foundation of this country by white males. I mean the constitution was written for and by white males to begin with and it was through the amendments that we have grown to realize that it should apply to everyone. While I was a law student there were some of us women law students [who] worked really hard on trying to get the Equal Rights Amendment passed and a couple of us did a little booklet to pass out to other students based upon the Equal Rights Amendment, and that failed. So I also think that there&#8217;s been a real tension through the years between those who&#8217;ve worked on racial equality and gender equality and I think a lot of that&#8217;s a class issue. I mean if you&#8217;re trying to put food on the table and just keep your family together and a roof over your head it&#8217;s kind of hard to understand why these middle-class women would be out saying, &#8220;Well, I want equality.&#8221; So I think in a lot of ways the gender equality battle, or struggle, has been by middle-class women who didn&#8217;t have the struggle that a lot of the African Americans have had, because I think the racial equality, it hits all classes. I mean I&#8217;ve represented an African American history professor--.
JF: George White?
CN: Yes. He was my client and he suffered race discrimination.
JF: He was a UT professor, right?
CN: Yeah, UT professor in the history department. His wife, Deseriee, was a professor in the law school and also served on the board of trustees. So that inequality and that discrimination, it&#8217;s race discrimination, but I&#8217;ve also represented prisoners and I&#8217;ve seen discrimination in the prison. I mean in Morgan County the guards are white and a lot of the prisoners are African American and those guards didn&#8217;t even have the training or the knowledge and weren&#8217;t brought up to respect black people. So I think that race discrimination hits all classes of people, and gender discrimination does too but I think the people who&#8217;ve really been working for gender equality are the women who&#8217;ve had the luxuries like I have. The women who are trying to put food on the table and keep a roof over their head are not going to be able to be spending the time trying to get gender equality. They&#8217;re trying to feed their children.
JF: Have you seen connections among different classes of women when it comes to environmental issues?
CN: There may be now. When I&#8217;ve been involved in the environmental movement I think it&#8217;s been more a middle class movement too but the people may be waking up more now and it may just be we&#8217;re all realizing we&#8217;ve all got to work on that. I&#8217;m not sure how to answer that. I did see when I was a staff attorney with Legal Services how hard it is to organize people who are really poor. I did tenant organizing against slum landlords and some of it was against the public housing, KCDC, and those people who had jobs and were not just totally devastated were more likely to be involved in the tenant organizing because they could think about something besides just having to survive.
JF: Do you think that there&#8217;s--? How has living and working in the South impacted your experiences?
CN: I&#8217;ve never lived and worked anywhere else. [Laughs]
JF: [Laughs]
CN: I don&#8217;t really--. You know I&#8217;m not sure how to answer that. I do know that there were very few female litigators when I first started my trial work, because I&#8217;ve always been a civil litigator, I&#8217;ve always done trials, and so--. I don&#8217;t know whether to say this. We may need to cut this. Well probably not. I really have always preferred federal court to state court because you don&#8217;t see the good ol&#8217; boy system as much in federal court. They follow the rules more and there&#8217;s not as much of the white boy syndrome there, although there could be, it&#8217;s just a more formal place. There is a judge who&#8217;s deceased now, a book has been written about him, Robert Taylor, Judge Taylor, and he was on the bench for many, many years and when I first went into practice he was the federal judge. Part of the time between the TVA case and opening my own law office I worked with Rural Legal Services on some civil rights cases they had and I worked on a fair housing case with one of their attorneys. We were in Judge Taylor&#8217;s courtroom, just the counsel bench and he&#8217;d been--. Lenny was the lead attorney and I was just there with him, and Judge Taylor looked down from the bench, pointed his finger at me, and said, &#8220;Young lady, are you one of those that does those discrimination cases?&#8221; I mean it was really--. I mean he was really funny. He was really old by then and what he said was okay, but it was just definite discrimination on his part, [Laughs] and at that time I hadn&#8217;t even done any discrimination cases in his court so he just saw I was a woman and he said that. There&#8217;s a whole book about stuff like that that he said. But Lenny, my lead counsel, said, &#8220;Oh, no, your honor. She&#8217;s just a really fine person,&#8221; [Laughs] and so, you know. I mean it&#8217;s things like that that have happened in the past and we all have stories like that. There was another attorney that kept calling--. Millie Cunningham, we shared office space for about eight years, good friend of mine. She was a family attorney and this attorney kept calling her &#8220;honey&#8221; and so she called him "honey&#8221; on the phone right back to him one day and he just kind of, you know, went, &#8220;Ha, ha, ha,&#8221; and never did it again, but those kinds of things happened. But for the most part as far as my relationship with the Knoxville bar, the attorneys have been really good to work with and have been respectful and I don&#8217;t feel that I&#8217;ve had a problem. Of course there are a lot more women now too but even at that point I felt like I did not really--. I didn&#8217;t like suffer a hostile environment here in Knoxville.
JF: A lot of the women I&#8217;ve spoken with have talked about it in terms of--. They say something like, I don&#8217;t remember overt discrimination or I don&#8217;t remember obvious discrimination but more of the little things here or there. What kind of strategies or reactions did you and your fellow women peers have to deal with those kinds of moments where somebody would call you &#8220;honey&#8221; inappropriately or maybe expect to be speaking to your male peer--
CN: Oh, yeah, that&#8217;s happened.
JF: --and not you? How would you react to that, or did you find that there were better ways to react than others to get your point across? Can you give me some sense of--?
CN: Well since I was older, because I mean there were a lot of attorneys who were older than I was but since I was older I just didn&#8217;t ever let it get me down. I mean I would just kind of laugh it off. If I went into a deposition and somebody asked if I was the court reporter, which happened more than once, I&#8217;d say, no, I&#8217;m the attorney. I guess I would just try to be better than they were, know more than they did, know the rules better than they did, write a better brief than they did. I just try to get them that way. I wasn&#8217;t always better than they were but I always just tried to be. [Laughs] Then if they were older I&#8217;d just kind of laugh it off: Oh, they grew up that way. They can&#8217;t help it. If it was someone younger I might tell him. I think I probably did tell a couple of people that wasn&#8217;t appropriate. And then I guess as people got to know me too, I mean you kind of deal with somebody on a personal basis. They&#8217;d a lot of times kid me about my politics rather than my gender. [Laughs]
JF: Really?
CN: Yeah, and that was okay. I&#8217;d kid them about theirs. [Laughs]
JF: [Laughs] It seems you wore your heart on your sleeve in the sense of devoting your professional life to a fight for racial equality. Do you think that there were specific life experiences or educational experiences that helped prepare you for the role that you&#8217;ve played over the past thirty-some years in the struggle for equality?
CN: Well I think my mother had a great influence on me. In the third grade there was a little girl in my class who was not allowed to participate in--we had May Day then too [Laughs] in elementary school--in the May Day program. She was told she couldn&#8217;t and she had to go sit in the infirmary in the elementary school, which was like a closet, because she couldn&#8217;t afford a costume. I went home and told my mother about it, and she was white so it wasn&#8217;t racial but it was an economic sort of thing, and my mother was so incensed that she went to the principal and she just about got that teacher fired and the little girl did get to participate. So things like that, when you&#8217;re a child growing up, you see how the world is treating some other people and that it&#8217;s not fair, and even though we were the same race it carries over. And I think, you know, graduating from high school in 1960 and Josephine Clark coming to our high school. She&#8217;s a college professor now in Georgia and I went back for my fiftieth high school reunion this year and there&#8217;s a big display in her honor on the wall at the high school, showing her in the hall of the high school and how badly she was treated and that she&#8217;s a professor now. So, I think some growing up experiences, and then what I experienced as a young adult in both Winston-Salem and in Kingsport with the black communities.
JF: I&#8217;m going to pause real quick, just get to the next track.  CN: Okay. [Break in recording 26:50 to 27:20]  JF: I wanted to ask you how your ideas of civil rights, your definitions of civil rights, your personal, emotional feelings about civil rights, how they&#8217;ve changed over the past thirty, forty years.  CN: Golly, that&#8217;s a really good question. I guess I&#8217;ve become more global because in the &#8217;80s I got involved in peace and justice work in Central America and went to Nicaragua with Witness for Peace and we had a real active Central American group here in Knoxville and some of us were arrested in John Duncan&#8217;s office over the Contra war. Then I&#8217;ve also gotten involved in Middle East peace issues and went with the Fellowship of Reconciliation and Muslim Public Affairs Council to Israel and Palestinian territories in 2002 and we were put in detention in Tel Aviv airport and sent home.  JF: Oh, my gosh.  CN: And I got several speaking engagements after that that I wouldn&#8217;t have gotten if I&#8217;d been able to make the trip. I&#8217;ve been real involved in Women in Black. We started Women in Black vigils here and have stood on the corner in front of the federal building every Tuesday for about eight and a half years now.  JF: Can you say briefly what Women in Black is?  CN: Women in Black was started by Israeli women in 1988 in Jerusalem in opposition to their government&#8217;s policies over the Palestinian territories and demanding that their government go back to the agreed upon 1967 boundaries of Israel and the Palestinian territories, and of course they&#8217;ve encroached on that tremendously each year since then. So we are standing in solidarity with our Israeli sisters in Jerusalem.   So I feel--. I mean there&#8217;s still a lot of racial injustice in this country and there are injustices all over the world and there&#8217;s still gender inequality too. I mean the discrimination cases, the people that I meet with, I mean sexual harassment is still alive and well. I mean there&#8217;s still a lot of sexual harassment, there&#8217;s retaliation when people report it, there are racial remarks, there are gender remarks, there&#8217;s derogatory treatment. For me personally I still feel passionate about it but I feel like I don&#8217;t get as upset about it. I mean as far as my cases for my law practice I&#8217;ve always felt that you lose perspective if you get emotional about a case. I realize that things may not change a whole lot in my lifetime but I still have to try to make it happen. I get emotional [Laughs] over it. And then I also am a Quaker now and that makes a difference as far as I feel like I have a whole history of people who worked against slavery and did a lot of work that they didn&#8217;t see the results until after they were dead and gone.  JF: Is it hard sometimes to see things move so slowly, or are you bolstered by memories of certain turning points that you&#8217;ve witnessed where the culmination of years of work, sometimes decades of work?  CN: Yeah, I mean in my lifetime there have been some significant court decisions. The Brown v. Board of Education, I was in junior high school then, in 1954, and then we had the Voting Rights Act that I&#8217;ve actually used in a couple of cases where voters were denied the right to vote in Knoxville, and the use of the Voting Rights Act of 1967. So, and golly, Barack Obama being elected President; I mean what bigger turning point could that be? I went back to North Carolina, my home state, to work in his campaign. It was just really exhilarating. But now here we are again trying to still fight the same struggles because they&#8217;ve been after him ever since he got elected.  JF: Do you think there&#8217;s a difference between political or legal change and cultural change? Do you see them happening together or is one catching up to another?  CN: Well, I don&#8217;t think they happen together very often, and there&#8217;ll be bits of cultural change here and then there&#8217;ll be a legal change and then this culture over here is not changing, and that&#8217;s all in our country, in our nation, so I think it really gets down to such a local thing too. I&#8217;m in a very conservative area of the country and yet there is a significant number of really strong progressive people in this community, and that&#8217;s exhilarating. So I think that it doesn&#8217;t all happen at the same time. Sometimes the courts are ahead at least of some people and maybe not caught up with other people, like the district judge&#8217;s decision in California knocking down Proposition 8. He was catching up to a large number of people in our culture but then there&#8217;s still this pocket back there that&#8217;s incensed and wants to keep it like it was. So I don&#8217;t know if that answered your question. [Laughs]  JF: Oh yeah, it did, absolutely. How have you seen issues of rights around sexuality, whether it&#8217;s women&#8217;s reproductive rights or gay rights, playing out in this region of the country, in eastern Tennessee?  CN: Well it&#8217;s made me really sad for years to have to tell people when they call me over the phone, because I would get ten calls for every person that I would see usually, and if they have been fired from a job because they were gay or lesbian, because of their homosexuality, I&#8217;d have to say, well you don&#8217;t have any rights. They can fire you. Of course they can fire you for good reason, bad reason, no reason at all, but if it&#8217;s a violation of the state or federal discrimination law or whistle blower then they do have a right, but sexuality or your sexual preference is not recognized as a protected class or as a class that you cannot discriminate against. So I have to say well unless you have AIDS or HIV you have no rights, and that&#8217;s been really hard. It needs to be changed but because of the attitude of some of the people in our culture it&#8217;s going to take awhile.  JF: Do you see bridges or alliances between movements, between say groups working for racial equality around housing, groups working for gender equality around women&#8217;s health clinics, groups working for gay rights around issues of discrimination in hiring and firing? Over the years have you seen alliances and bridges forming between these groups and has that been productive here in eastern Tennessee?  CN: Well I don&#8217;t have a broad picture because I&#8217;m just me and I haven&#8217;t been a part of a lot. I&#8217;m sure that there are groups and alliances that I don&#8217;t know about but I guess one example in my mind would be the Highlander Center. The Highlander Research and Education Center was at the forefront in the racial discrimination, the civil rights movement. Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks both went there. Now it&#8217;s really concentrating a lot on gay and lesbian issues [and] sexual preference issues and it&#8217;s also gotten more into global issues. You see a lot of the same people. Like tomorrow we&#8217;ll have the counter demonstration against the Nazis and the Klan and their theme, I understand, for their rally is immigration and of course it&#8217;s white supremacy, so a lot of us who would be also at a gay rights march will also be there tomorrow and I&#8217;m sure there are lots of people who were very involved in the civil rights movement and also the anti-war movement. I mean it&#8217;s a lot of the same people because it comes down to a respect for human beings and that all human beings should be equal regardless of what their sexual preference is, their race, their nationality, their gender, so it just comes down to a basic respect of individuals, of human beings.  JF: How much of an influence was the anti-war movement in your life, or what impact did the Vietnam War have on your ideas about rights and equality?  CN: Oh, it probably had a lot because when I was in college and then after that--. Well when we were in Kingsport, Tennessee and my husband was youth minister of a large Methodist church there he was doing draft counseling and we had a very good friend who was trying to get his conscientious objector status. The same thing in Knoxville with a student who was very active in the Methodist student movement here and had gone through ROTC and just said, I can&#8217;t go to war, so we went through those hearings with him. Then just Martin Luther King, his messages, I mean I would sit my baby in front of the TV to hear Martin Luther King and watch him. Also the kneel-ins in the civil rights movement [were happening in Durham] when I was an undergrad at Duke and, I just remembered this, my former husband, we were dating at that time, we went to hear Malcolm X and Floyd McKissick debate about whether violence was the answer or nonviolence and Floyd McKissick of course was speaking for nonviolence and at that point Malcolm X was speaking for violence. The [40:55 sitting white] fathers in Durham would not allow them to speak at the hall where they were supposed to speak so they had to use the upstairs of this little room above a service station. I remember going to that and I realized--. It was really very powerful. We were about the only white people there. There were four white people there and the others were two students too. Malcolm X had his people stationed around the room to kind of keep the audience like they wanted them to be and to clap and yell and all and when it came Floyd McKissick&#8217;s turn to speak he said, you know I just don&#8217;t have anything I can say, and it was because of the way they&#8217;d been treated by the local government in Durham, North Carolina. So that had an impact on me too, the way the government, the local governments in the South were dealing with the whole racial issue and things just blow up when you don&#8217;t try to bring some kind of discussion. So those are just things that kind of hit me along the way.  JF: Can I ask you to tell me a little bit about what you remember of the ERA struggle, your role in that and what motivated you to fight for it or to be a part of that struggle and your feelings on the outcome?  CN: It was so long ago I can&#8217;t remember the details. It was in the early &#8217;70s. Jean Lacy, whose husband was a professor at the law school, was really working on trying to get the ERA passed and there were about three of us who kind of took that on as a project to try to do some education around it, and I remember going to some groups and speaking, and I think the National Organization of Women, the NOW chapter, got involved in it too, and we prepared a little booklet, which I may still have actually. I just remember being really disappointed that it never went anywhere. I don&#8217;t remember now what the vote was. I think it came to a vote but it didn&#8217;t pass, or it came to a vote as to whether to put it on the ballot for an amendment. I don&#8217;t even remember exactly what the process was. It would have had to have been ratified by the states to become an amendment, like the suffragette amendment, the 19th Amendment.  JF: What were the most important issues to you around women&#8217;s rights in the &#8217;70s?  CN: Well equal pay was a big issue even then because I remember we had buttons that said fifty cents--maybe it was fifty-nine cents--women were making fifty cents to the dollar that males were making.  JF: I had one of those about ten years ago that said seventy-five cents to the dollar, so we&#8217;ve moved up a quarter. [Laughs]  CN: It's gone up a little bit. As far as I know I didn&#8217;t suffer pay inequity. I was with legal aid and then I went with the Department of Interior. I mean I don&#8217;t think I ever checked but I didn&#8217;t ever feel I suffered pay inequity like in the private sector was happening because I never worked for a law firm. But probably that was a big one, and then also, I wasn&#8217;t really working in this area, but spouse abuse has been a big problem. I mean I did do divorces when I first started and when I was with legal aid before I went into housing so I think that--. It used to be in Tennessee women couldn&#8217;t even sign a contract, I mean women had no rights, so a lot of that has come through statutes.  JF: Do you remember any events, demonstrations or protests, or do you remember any social events that you went to or that you heard about of women organizing or getting together around women&#8217;s rights, consciousness raising groups, or health clinics?  CN: Yeah, I wasn&#8217;t a part of consciousness raising groups, I always kind of felt like I missed out on something there, but, no. Recently because of the efforts of Wanda Sobieski we have a women&#8217;s suffrage statue now in Market Square. Did you know about that?  JF: Mm mm.  CN: Yeah, it&#8217;s a lovely statue with three women, it&#8217;s commemorating the 19th Amendment, and the three women, there&#8217;s one from east Tennessee, middle Tennessee, and west Tennessee. Here again, because of Wanda and some other people that worked with her there has been a commemorative event every year for the last several years since that statue was unveiled, and I guess it was the year that it was unveiled that we had reenactments and different ones of us dressed up and I was Eleanor [47:19] and I ran across the statement I&#8217;d written for her [Laughs] yesterday, I think, when I was going through emails, cleaning out my computer. So it has kind of brought to the Knoxville community the women&#8217;s suffragette movement and we&#8217;re reminded of it each year. Tennessee was the last state to ratify the 19th Amendment and actually there was something on WUOT yesterday about it. So because we are the thirty-sixth state at least in Knoxville we recognize that each year, and that&#8217;s neat to do. But I don&#8217;t, other than around the ERA, except when I&#8217;ve done programs on employment discrimination. I would speak to gender discrimination in that. I&#8217;ve been more just in the legal field for the last thirty years, so.  JF: How did the national women&#8217;s movement impact this region, if at all, you know, the heavyweights of the &#8217;70s like Gloria Steinem or the big events like the beauty pageant protest?  CN: You know I&#8217;m not sure how much impact it had. I mean we had Bella Abzug come to Knoxville, and here again it&#8217;s largely because of Wanda, and I think Gloria Steinem came years ago. There was a NOW chapter in Knoxville but I wasn&#8217;t in it, and I think it&#8217;s not still going, but there were some women who were involved. At that point I was in law school and then I was practicing law and I was also commuting an hour one way. We went back to the land in the &#8217;70s so I was commuting into work.  JF: Where did you live?  CN: Grainger County. We built a log house up there. And I was doing tenant organizing with legal aid so I wasn&#8217;t involved in the local women&#8217;s movement. I was trying to think who might have been. I don&#8217;t know. Maybe Fran [Ansley] was, I think, or Brenda Bell. Y&#8217;all need to talk to Brenda Bell.   JF: Yeah, Jessie&#8217;s interviewed her already. Well, let&#8217;s see. Let me ask you a question: Is there anything you thought I would ask that I haven&#8217;t brought up or asked or is there anything that you thought would come up and it hasn&#8217;t come up?  CN: I don&#8217;t think of anything. I would like to say one other thing about my mother though, because I didn&#8217;t know a lot about her activities in Greensboro. I knew that she was involved in women&#8217;s issues. She was not a lawyer, she was actually a drama major at Greensboro College and was an actress and did commercials and that sort of thing.  JF: Oh, wow.  CN: But she was instrumental in starting the commission on the status of women under the city council in Greensboro, and I learned about that probably about ten or fifteen years ago. They established an award in her honor before she died, the Emily Smith Award, that&#8217;s given to a young woman who has made a lot of progress and kind of bettered herself and all, and I&#8217;m going to Greensboro for that award to be given to a woman August 28. So I think I kind of came by it naturally in some ways because even though it wasn&#8217;t talked a lot about when I was growing up my mother really did a lot as far as women&#8217;s issues locally and my practice has been based on or been centered around mostly race discrimination and gender discrimination, which includes sexual harassment.  JF: What kind of generational changes have you seen say from your mother&#8217;s generation and her achievements, your generation, the women of the &#8217;70s and &#8217;80s, pushing into professional realms and fighting legal and political battles, and then say the next generation, your children&#8217;s generation--my generation right now [Laughs]--in terms of the way rights are talked about, whether it&#8217;s gender rights or civil rights, rights and equality?   CN: Well I think one thing, my daughter is--. She was born in &#8217;64. She&#8217;s in her mid-forties [Laughs] and has two children, and I was so intent on changing the world and doing the legal cases and my work I feel like I missed a lot of my children&#8217;s growing up years and my daughter has really turned that around. I mean she&#8217;s worked really hard to try to abolish the death penalty in North Carolina--they live in Asheville--has headed up a huge effort on gay and lesbian rights--and she&#8217;s straight; she&#8217;s not lesbian--but she has really always put her children first. She has taken time for her children, she has done things with them, and I just feel like I missed that, and I think that that&#8217;s true with other mothers in her generation. They&#8217;ve put it more into perspective. I don&#8217;t know, you may see something different, but I think women in my mother&#8217;s generation basically stayed home and a lot of the times resented it but women in my generation have just pushed to achieve, to make changes, to get equality for themselves and for others, and I feel like I missed a lot of my children&#8217;s growing up because I was doing that and that was my emphasis, and I don&#8217;t see my daughter doing that. She takes time, they go camping, she does things with her children, and is working part time doing--. She&#8217;s got her master&#8217;s in social work and works for attorneys whose clients could get the death penalty and is working as a mitigation specialist.  JF: So would you see that as a positive outcome--  CN: Oh yeah.  JF: --of the sacrifices and struggles of a generation of women--  CN: Oh.  JF: --pushing for equality and fighting discrimination on multiple fronts, that the next generation had role models, had precedents that they could use as resources?  CN: Well I think I should have been more balanced. I wish I had been. My daughter may have seen that--. Well she always told me when I&#8217;d say, I just didn&#8217;t spend any time with y&#8217;all: Well we turned out fine, Mama. Don&#8217;t worry about it. But I think that it&#8217;s made her realize that the--. I mean those years are very short, and so she&#8217;s taking advantage of it better, and I don&#8217;t know that I made any changes that she could build on but I guess I have spurred her on in some ways, especially on the death penalty work. But I&#8217;m glad that she&#8217;s found more of a balance, and I see the young male attorneys doing the same thing. I think they have found more of a balance, and the younger female. I think at least the young female attorneys that I know about are trying to strike a better balance.  JF: Do you think that relates to changes in gender roles, that there&#8217;s more of a sense of sharing domestic responsibilities and there&#8217;s more of a value placed on parenting as a shared experience?  CN: Oh, I think it could be, yeah, and I think that&#8217;s positive, because I have heard a speech given by a male colleague, an attorney, who basically said he missed his children&#8217;s growing up years and was sorry he did. So I think it&#8217;s true for males and females.   I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s anything else I thought you would ask me or not. [Laughs] I can&#8217;t think of anything.  JF: Well I know you have guests you&#8217;re expecting.  CN: What time is it?  JF: A quarter to 7:00.  CN: Okay. It&#8217;s probably somebody you ought to talk to too, Eldora, [Laughs] who got her master&#8217;s in social work here in the early &#8217;70s and is a therapist.  JF: Well then one last question: As a resident of Knoxville now for--forty years almost?  CN: Golly. Yeah, I guess so. Well we lived in Grainger County for five years and actually in Blount County for nine years because my husband was director of Camp Wesley Woods, but my office has always been here.  JF: What kind of changes have you seen in the region over the past forty years, for good or bad, whether political changes, cultural changes, economic changes?  CN: Well a positive change, our downtown is more vibrant now, Knoxville is. When I would stay late and work I would come out of my office at night and downtown Knoxville would just be dead. And I think that&#8217;s a good thing. I&#8217;d like to think that people are more open but I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s true. It may just be the people that I associate with, although there was a lot of work for Obama locally even though east Tennessee is Republican. I think that the University of Tennessee still discriminates against women, against other races, against people from other countries. I&#8217;m disappointed that that has not changed.  JF: Has there ever been a strong movement amongst students at UT? Or let me rephrase that question: Do you see it as a problem in administration or in the students sort of not being active enough?  CN: I don&#8217;t know that much about the students but I know that when George White was fired there was a huge uproar and there were demonstrations and students and faculty participated in that. I don&#8217;t think that there has been anything like the Billy Graham, Nixon crusade demonstration--that was right before we came in &#8217;71--where some of the professors were arrested and it was huge, and that was over the war. I do think that the United Campus Workers and the Progressive Student Alliance are doing good work at UT. The United Campus Workers is the staff, that&#8217;s a union of staff, and the Progressive Student Alliance is a student organization. But it&#8217;s a large student body and I don&#8217;t know how big they are. I just know about what they&#8217;re doing because they&#8217;re friends of mine. I know the people that are doing it. But people call me all the time about UT, discrimination.   I don&#8217;t know. Hopefully we&#8217;re getting a little greener. [Laughs] And I love my neighborhood. My neighborhood is very diverse.  JF: This is the 4th and Gill neighborhood?  CN: Yes. Diverse lifestyles. My next door neighbor is an African American English professor at UT, across the street is a young woman from Hamburg, Germany and her African American husband and their little baby, next to them is a gay couple who are at UT, and then down the street is an African American woman and her French husband. Now there&#8217;s not a lot of economic diversity here on my block but we also have a housing co-op. We have seven houses in the neighborhood run by a housing co-op for low income people. So I guess it&#8217;s the best you can get around here. [Laughs]  JF: Well thank you so much, Carol,--  CN: Well thank you, Joey.  JF: --for sharing your time and sharing your stories with us.  CN: I appreciate you asking me. I didn&#8217;t even know what I was going to say. [Laughs]  JF: It works out the best when it happens that way.  CN: And I don&#8217;t know, I may think of other things but--  JF: Well maybe we&#8217;ll do another interview in the future.  CN: --enjoyed talking with you. Well thank you for doing this, and I&#8217;ll be really interested in seeing and hearing all of it.  JF: Great.  CN: You know there&#8217;s a civil rights museum now in Greensboro and I haven&#8217;t been to it. I think it&#8217;s in the old Woolworth building.  JF: Are you going to go visit?  CN: I hope to go when I go over August 28, yeah.  JF: It&#8217;s been exciting. I haven&#8217;t been to it yet but there&#8217;s been some real exciting events and people are really just pulling together around it.  CN: See I think that&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening in the South, is people are realizing that those in power make mistakes and that there was discrimination, and that&#8217;s a beginning.  JF: So a recognition and a reckoning?  CN: Yeah. That&#8217;s a beginning anyway.
