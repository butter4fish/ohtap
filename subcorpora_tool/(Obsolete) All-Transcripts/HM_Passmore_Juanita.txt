Story_ID: 56419
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I've got five questions to ask you.  They're, they're "People" magazine-ish-type questions--
Speaker 2: Oh?
Speaker 1: --but we always ask these so, Mrs. Passmore, what's your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food is soul food in any form that's cooked well.  I like greens, ribs, beef, especially short ribs of beef, so that doesn't mean it's an expensive cut.  But those are the kind of things that I like in soul food, well, well prepared.
Speaker 1: Okay, what's your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Red.
Speaker 1: All right.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: The Bahamas--
Speaker 1: All right--
Speaker 2: --for fun.  For history I like to go to England and France and Paris [France] and those kind of places for the history that's there, but for just laying back and having a good time, the Bahamas and Hawaii.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Actually I like Chicago [Illinois] in the seasons, but one of the reasons that I might like it is because of my ability to travel and get away from the cold.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Ma'am, do you have a favorite phrase or a saying?
Speaker 2: I have a couple of them.  One of them is, let nobody have power over you but God; and the next one is, only what you do for God will last.
Story_ID: 56420
Speaker 1: All right.  Let's talk about your, your parents, and could you state the names of your mother and your father and you know, spell them for us.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother had a very odd name.  It is in the Bible, but it's Abia, A-B-I-A.  Her birth name was Wimbush, W-I-M-B-U-S-H.
Speaker 1: And your father?
Speaker 2: My father who raised me was my stepfather.  His name is Percy, P-E-R-C-Y, last name, Jenkins, J-E-N-K-I-N-S.
Speaker 1: Okay, and were you born here in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I sure was, right here in [Cook] County Hospital.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were your, were your parents born here?
Speaker 2: No, my, my mother was born in Macon, Georgia, to a family of four girls, and by Abia, Dazzle, and the other two died in--at, at a very early age.
Speaker 1: Their names were Abia and--
Speaker 2: And my auntie's name was Dazzle, D-A-Z-Z-L-E.
Speaker 1: Well, those are unusual names--
Speaker 2: Aren't they though?
Speaker 1: Is, are, are there stories attached to those names or did they talk about how they, they--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: How they, how they selected them?  Well, Abia is in the Bible.  It's pronounced Abye (ph.).  And my mother said that when Dazzle was born, she was so bright and shiny till she just--the nickname became her name.  You know, they named her at birth the Dazzle, but she was very young when that name was attached to her brightness.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And I don't mean in color.  She was just a smiley, happy baby.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what, what year was your mother born?
Speaker 2: About 1910 or 1909.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did--she had a sister.  It's just the two of them?
Speaker 2: Yes, and Dazzle was the youngest, and she was would have been about six years younger than my mother.
Story_ID: 56421
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have any family tra--traditions about where the family came from or, or what they, what they did back in the days of slavery and that sort of thing or?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, we had a picture of my great-great-grandmother.  I'm the fifth generation, by the way.  I knew all of them.  I knew my mother, my grandmother, my great-grandmother, and my great-great-grandmother.  And she lived until I was twelve years old, and her name was Sencie (ph.) Cook.  So she remembered being a slave.
Speaker 1: Can you spell that?
Speaker 2: C--I don't know how you spell you spell Sencie.  I, I would spell it S-E-N-C-I-E, Sencie.  I remember her.  I was twelve years old--
Speaker 1: And she had been a slave too?
Speaker 2: --when she passed.  She had been a slave.  And I remember so vividly because she lived here in Chicago [Illinois].  The family brought each other up.  You know, that, that was so much of the tra--tradition.  One person would come, and they would send for the other.  This is a funny story, though it goes back.  Grandma Sencie Cook had beautiful legs, they said, and she was very proud of them.  And she would sit on the porch in her, in her rocker with her skirt up.  In those days, that was very daring for you to show your legs.  So she attracted a man, and this man wanted to marry Sencie.  He came by, asked her to marry him.  She agreed.  He went off and got in his wagon and came back to pick her up.  Well, all of my--all of her kids rushed out with sticks and stones and chased the man away (laughter).  So Sencie's big legs might have attracted somebody, but it didn't get her no husband 'cause the kids wouldn't let her have one.  And that was the family tale that we all grew up with, and as those of us who know her, we would hear it repeated often about how vain Sencie Cook was.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, this, this is Macon, Georgia?
Speaker 2: That was in Chicago.
Speaker 1: In Chicago--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, no, it was in Macon that they wanted to take her from, but the, the--when I knew, it was in Chicago.  In fact, I have a little burn on one of my hands where she was my babysitter.  And if you can remember, they used to have potbelly stoves, and when you had a potbelly stove, you had something like a tray underneath the stove that was made out of the iron or steel, or whatever, to keep the heat from the stove burning into the wood that was under this protective piece.  And I stumbled on it and put both hands up and hit that stove.  So for many, well, for many months--I don't just know how many 'cause I was about four or five and I had to be treated at [Cook] County Hospital for burns on my hand, and thank God I've never had any problems with it.  You know, County Hospital's are known for a burn center anyway, right, so I think I was very lucky to, to go there and have that treatment.  So, that was years ago that County was forward in burns.
Speaker 1: And so, so Sencie Cook was a slave, actually?
Speaker 2: She was actually a slave.  She, she told us not a lot of stories about slavery, but I remember one was about the fact that she couldn't go into the big house and that she was picking cotton, so forth and so on, you know, that kind of thing.  But she never dwelled on her, her life as a slave.  I think she was very young when freedom came.  And that I know that she talked about was Macon, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Did she live a long time?
Speaker 2: Well, I think--I was a kid, so I think that maybe what I thought was a long time might have been in her seventies at that time when she passed.  I'm not sure of the date.  But I'll tell you another funny thing about that.  You know, families had big funerals then.  People came from all over, and they had them in the home.  So grandma's casket was put in the living room and had neighbors and family and all bringing food from everywhere.  And of course, you stayed at the house with the corpse in the living room so that you all--we all at that time dressed alike.  If the family wore white, they had black bands on the men and black bands on your white dresses, and of course, you wore hats and many times you wore veils.  So, I was put to bed in a room where some of the dresses were hung on nails around the wall, and I must have been asleep when they laid me there because when I woke up, I couldn't go back to sleep 'cause I thought those white dresses were ghosts (laughter).  So I stayed awake all night watching the ghosts in the room.  And when the light finally came and thought--saw that they were dresses, it's a wonder I didn't run screaming and hollering 'cause I was deathly afraid of ghosts.  You know those stories that they would tell children in those days.  But anyway, I remember that very vividly, and I remember the funeral.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You don't see that of course anymore.
Story_ID: 56422
Speaker 1: What about your father?  Now, it's your stepfather [Percy Jenkins], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And he, he was, he, he was from Macon, Ge--Georgia?
Speaker 2: No, he was from Collins, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And my, my stepfather and my mother went to school together, grammar school together.  And he claims that he, he loved my mother from the day he saw her in about sixth grade and of course he died saying the same thing, he loved her throughout.  My father loved my mother so.  My stepfather loved my mother so till if he was--if she was in pain, he cried.  He was just that much attached to her, and it was a beautiful thing to see, that type of love expressed between people.
Speaker 1: So they met in school--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Met in grammar school.
Speaker 1: And they got, they got married young or did--
Speaker 2: No, they did not marry until during the war [World War II].  I was quite--I think I was about sixteen when they got married.
Speaker 1: That's in the '40s [1940s] then?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Story_ID: 56423
Speaker 1: Okay, now what, what did your pat--parents do for a living?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother [Abia Wimbush] was the homemaker, but she was gifted at making hats and so she had quite a bit of business as a hat designer, but other than that, she was a homemaker.  My mother was one of those women that cooked.  She wasn't a good cook, but she had meals on time, and you had to be on time at the table and all that kind of thing that went on in, in homes then.  You know, when you went to school you were--I was expected.  I went to Carter Grammar School, which was about a ten minute walk from my house, so my mother gave me fifteen minutes to get home.  And if you weren't home in fifteen minutes they became alarmed about you, so you always tried to be there on time.  And my mother would be in the window looking out the window to see that I got in safe.  When you got home you had to change your clothes and go down and play in the backyard.  I--is it the backyard or the front yard in the summer?  Anyway, in the wint--in the something in the summer you played in the backyard, and in the summer you played--after you got redressed you played in the front yard, so you knew all the kids in the neighborhood.  You played hopscotch, marbles, double-dutch.  You did all those things that I don't see children doing anymore, just children just laughing.  And you know what?  I lived at 310 East 57th Street for many years--maybe this is a little ahead of that stuff--because I lived on King Drive, which was South Parkway before that.  But I remember was the elevator was right next door to our building.  And when we would be listening to the radio when the elevator would go by, you would just be quiet, waiting for the elevator to pass before the radio could be heard again.  And nobody thought anything about it.  You know, we're so disturbed by noises now.  If an el [Chicago 'L' train] went by my house now, I would just be in panic almost.  But we got used to that noise and didn't even hear it, didn't even hear it.  So anyway, it was the happiness that came from knowing your neighbors, from being part of a community, for looking out for one another and truly being there for church and everything.  You know, on Sunday mornings you could see people walking out of the door almost clock time, you know, on clock, going to the different churches.  It was right across the street from the--ooh, what was the name of that church?  It's, it's still there--Shepherd, Good Shepherd, Good Shepherd--and what fine dress the women and men would be going to church every Sunday, and of course you'd put on your very best.  Mother looked at your whole entire wardrobe, checked out your shoes, your hair, saw that you were spic and span, and then you were sent off to Sunday school.  So those are the kind of memories that I have about childhood.  And my mother was not one who took a lot of stuff off of kids.  She, she was not too rigid, but she was certainly organized, and you had to be disciplined; that's the word, you had to be disciplined.  Of course, with me living with my grandmother sometimes, and at times I was glad, 'cause you know how grandmothers are.  They forgive children of things that mothers would have spanked you for.  So I had a wonderful childhood as far as being raised with a family with love and the two or three generations being exposed to me.
Speaker 1: And can, can you tell me about your brothers and sisters or any other relatives that you have that were around?
Speaker 2: Well, I was closer to my cousins, who I'm still closer to.  My--[aunt] Dazzle's children were Lionel Bosky (ph.) and Jacqueline, who is deceased.  Jacqueline is deceased, but Lionel was a sergeant on the police force, and he and I are still very close.  We were raised almost like sisters and brothers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I did have that comradeship with families, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your cousins were pretty much--
Speaker 2: The cousins were pretty much, yeah, right.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: In fact, now they call me cousin-auntie, their children do, because I'm really their cousin.  But I'm too old to be called cousin by them so I have all of their children calling me cousin-auntie.  I like that title.
Story_ID: 56424
Speaker 1: Now what did your stepfather [Percy Jenkins] do for a living?
Speaker 2: He worked for Consolidated Freightways for many years.  And that was a large trucking company, and he, he was--he fixed diesel engines and all that kind of thing.  But during Depression, he worked for Flora McKinney Florist.  That was a black-owned florist.  I think it was located around 47th and State, between 47th and 51st where the old Savoy used to be.  And they had a florist there, and he was a delivery person for there for many years.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: Flora Mc--McKenzie Florist was the name of it.  I think that's right, Florist McKenzie.
Story_ID: 56425
Speaker 1: So you were the only child in your household--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I was the only child in my household.
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)--your mother [Abia Wimbush] and father [Percy Jenkins]?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were you--did you get a lot of attention?
Speaker 2: Well, let's say I got a lot of attention, but also I got a lot of discipline.  We didn't have a large, large house, as you know, but we were fortunate not to live in a kitchenette, which was a popular way for people to live at that time.  So, in fact, my family used to call my mother the rich one because we lived in an apartment with four rooms, a bathroom to ourselves, a kitchen to ourselves.  Mama have--mama is my grandmother--had her own room; my father and my mother--stepfather and my mother had their own room, and guess what they gave me, a closet.  I had a closet, and in that closet--I didn't sleep in the closet, but in the closet was all of the things that belonged to me.  And I later on had a sense of self in there, and sometimes I would leave the door open so the chair in the doorway and just feel that that was my home, my own little special place.  And I think children need that.  You need that.  I put all my little--my diary, my dolls, my little artifacts that I thought--I used to love to collect bottles.  I had bottles of all shapes (laughter) and fashion, and they were in my closet.
Story_ID: 56426
Speaker 1: What were some of the other sights and sounds and smells of coming up?  Can you remember?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I remember the ice cream parlors on 58th Street.  They called--I think it was the Sweethearts Shop on 58th at Prairie that was there for so long.  And right up the street from there, right under the elevator on 58th Street what later on was called the--not Bermuda Road, but it was like Bermuda Road in that it was such a--Bucket of Bloodstream, one of those things, where Two-Gun Pete walked, cleaned up the street.
Speaker 1: Now who was he, just for those who don't--
Speaker 2: Two-Gun Pete was a black policeman who had a terrible reputation, and--I won't say terrible, but fearsome is what I'm trying to get to--and when you found that nobody could get 'em in order, Two-Gun Pete could get the kids in order or even the adults who were out of order.  And I remember that one tavern, it was so--it was a block away from the ice cream parlor that I'm talking about.  And you know, of course kids could not go into a tavern, but that tavern had an odor to it.  (Unclear) asked me about odors.  When you passed by that tavern, you smelled beer, whiskey, and all the things that mangled up with alcohol.  And of course, you were curious; you'd stand there and look at the people coming out and wonder what was going on in the tavern.  So I do remember that smell distinctly.  And of course, there was down the street from there, there was the place that sold live chickens.  You'd go in and pick your chicken, and then they would kill it, ring the neck, and you would take it home and finish plucking it and whatever before you cooked it, and you would chop it up, cut it up.  And so that was that was an experience that I don't think kids see now.  Of course, not being a form--farm--child, that to me was an experience just seeing chickens, live chickens, my God.
Story_ID: 56427
Speaker 1: Now, you talked about some of the games you played when you were a kid and as a, as a little girl.  What were your favorite radio shows?
Speaker 2: Well, of course it was "Amos and Andy."  Was it "Little Orphan Annie"?  Yeah, with the dog, and Sandy was the dog, I think the dog's name was.  And then we had--ooh, what's the name of that show?  I can't think right now, but he was "The Green Hornet," "The Green Hornet."  Then they had the man (unclear) who knows what evil lurks in the city, whoever that name was.  Yeah, those are the kind of shows we watched, yeah.  You had to be on time to listen to that, and you had to have that dinner to them, sitting around the table or sitting at your Philco radio.  My father bought my--my stepfather [Percy Jenkins] bought my mother [Abia Wimbush] a Philco radio, and it must have been in 1947.  It had a little round dial on it.  And do you know what it said?--"For TV."  We kept that radio a long time--a little round dial, and I had a space on there said "For TV."  See, the war [World Ward II] really had threw TV behind.  TV was already had its capabilities.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: But the war slowed down the manufacturing of the TV.
Speaker 1: Do you, do you remember going to the fair [1933 Chicago World's Fair].  Did you, did you--
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: --go the fair--
Speaker 2: --I did.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: I did.  There was a fair--there as a--the fairgrounds.  I remember my mother taking me on the--I for--is it--it went across the grounds like a ski lift.  We went seated in a ski lift thing, and you--you know I hadn't thought about this in years.  I don't know what it was called now, but yes, I did remember going to the fair and going on that ride--thousands of people, hot summer day, cotton candy and all the stuff that goes with the fairs and all that kind of thing, waiting in line.
Speaker 1: So do you think you had a pretty happy childhood experience?
Speaker 2: For the most part, yes, I did.  As I look back on it, of course, you know, any time a child is restricted from doing things they wanna do they think they're miserable.  But as you look back on it, you find out that your parents were really looking out for you and trying to let you have a happy childhood without growing up too fast.
Story_ID: 56428
Speaker 1: Now, now what about school?  Tell, tell me something about school.  You went to Carter?
Speaker 2: I went to Carter Grammar School [Chicago, Illinois], but that was after I had gone to boarding school for a few years.  I went to called the Sacred Hearts, which is a Catholic school but is no longer there.  It was on 50-something and Prairie.  They tore it down.  So after I left there, I went to Burke School for one semester and then I went to Carter School, where I graduated from--and Carter School was the only school in Chicago at that time that had a swimming pool.  It might still be.  I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I had some very good teachers there too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had one named Mrs. Robinson.  Mrs. Robinson was a black teacher whose son in fact was just a few grades ahead of me, but she showed a lot of interest in the children.  And one of the things that she did was she separated the boys and the girls one--I don't know whether it was more than one time, but at one--one time I remember having all the girls stay late.  And she had asked for us to tell our parents that we would be late coming home that day.  And she talked about hygiene, talked about careers and things like that, and they were not teaching that then.  And of course, you know black history was certainly not taught in schools.  So she had us to select a little saying and to remember.  All of us had a saying to remember.  And mine was, you never miss the water till your well runs dry.  And see, I do remember it to this day.  But I also remember her deep concern for her students.  You know, she would take time with each of us, talk to us and try to instill some pride in us.  And she would have--at that time, I think she had pictures of--it wasn't Mrs. Bethune, but it certainly was--who is, who is Grandma Moses or the black Moses?
Speaker 1: Harriet Tubman.
Speaker 2: Harriet Tubman.  She talked about him [sic, her].  She talked about Marcus Garvey and all those things to make us aware of some of the things--and of course, Booker T. Washington.  And she had some--a few books that we were privileged to read or she read to us.  So, yes, I was aware of black history through her, and I will always remember that kind of dedication and that kind of teacher.  We need more of them.
Speaker 1: And what, what--was the faculty of your school integrated basically or was it--
Speaker 2: Not that much.  Most of the teachers then were white.  And in fact, I think she was the only one that I remember, remember as one of color.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your community, was it, was it integrated basically or was it mostly black?
Speaker 2: Not for, not for grammar school.  It was black by that time.  But it was a changing neighborhood, but it, it was--I don't remember any white families living there at that time.  The only white families that were there were the janitors' children.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they still had some white janitors in the neighborhood whose children did go to Carter School.
Story_ID: 56429
Speaker 1: So what kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: I was a fair student.  I wasn't raising any sand about the top grades, but I never was a failing student.  My parents thought of that.  But I had to apply myself to it.  I remember being in a spelling bee, and I failed on the word garbage.  I don't think I could still spell it (laughter).  But that, I had got up to that word and I remember that's where I flunked, on garbage.  But do remember my parents grilling me and grilling me before the spelling bee, I mean the--my grandmother, my stepfather [Percy Jenkins], and my mother [Abia Wimbush] were all in the dining room going over those words that would be in the spelling bee with me.  And that's the kind of attention that I had.  You know, they were interested in what you were doing, because they were interested in seeing that you got what you went to school for, that you got a good education, and that you had the sights of your potentiality met within the home, and they encouraged you.  We used to have what we called vaudeville at the house.  About once a month we would crowd into the house, and different members of the family would come and we would sing, though we couldn't sing, we were singing; we would dance.  My mother was always quite a card at those parties, would put on a pair, big, big bloomers that hit the knee and came up almost to her chest and do a balloon-- a, a bloomer dance, and of course that brought the house down.  So we had that kind of entertainment in the home, so we were all kind of hammish.
Speaker 1: It sounds like a very lively family.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we, we enjoyed that.  We had Thanksgiving together.  I had a picture of was about seventy-some family members that were in the basement of a church that my auntie later on--another aunt of my grandmothers, another sister of my grandmothers--became a minister.  And she had a church on State Street, a storefront church, and so we always used that--after that for family gatherings.  And I'm sorry that picture got away from us.  Maybe some of my cousins have it, but it was seventy-some family members in one picture.
Story_ID: 56430
Speaker 1: Yeah, what about the Century of Progress.  Now you went--the fair you were describing earlier was in 1933 [Chicago World's Fair], Century of Progress--
Speaker 2: That's yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --and you were only about, about four or five I guess.
Speaker 2: That's why I have such a short memory of that.  But because of that particular ride was so spectacular, I do remember being in line and getting on that ride.  But of course so many things came out of that fair that you saw pictures of the coming kitchens and all that stuff that would later on become--I think the word then was streamline or modern.  Those were two words that were used frequently.  Streamline was a big word.  Everything was supposed to be so uncluttered, not like the iceboxes that we'd had when I was coming up and with the water under the, under the box so that it would drip, drip, drip.  And that was my chore to pull that pan out from under there and keep the water from spilling over on the floor.  And believe me, I had to, I had to be smart enough to do that because every time the water dripped over, I had to scrub the whole floor.  So I was damn sure that I was gonna get that water before it spilled over (laughter).  You know, we had the ice signs go in the window, and you said twenty-five, fifty pounds or when you're gonna have a lot of company you've got a hundred pounds of ice so that you could put the potato salad and possibly make a little ice cream, whatever, you've got a lot of ice at that time.  And that was also interesting 'cause you know kids wanna chip off the ice.  So one of my aunties--no, it was one of my father's sisters was married to an ice man.  So, you know, I had clout in the neighborhood because when he would come by, I'd get on the ice truck and let my friends get on, and he'd chip us a piece of ice.  That was big time (laughter).  Yeah, I had a happy childhood.
Story_ID: 56431
Speaker 1: Okay, now, in high school, now, you were--your high school days coincided with World War II--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, so what was it like, you know, being in high school, you know, in 19--1940 to '44 [1944]?
Speaker 2: Well, I think we became aware of the war because, as I recall, we were definitely saying that maybe they would come to our shores.  And at that point, we had not been--our friends were not, you know, in grammar--right at the high school, rather, I hadn't come into too many of my own age as being sucked into the war.  But then the ROTC boys were being called up to war, and I think we really had a sense of dread and fear that they would not come home.  And we thought of it as combat, not like we have now, missiles and all that, but one-on-one combat, and you saw men who were maimed and things like that, that were frightening to you.  So I think--I know personally I had some very hard times thinking about my stepfather [Percy Jenkins] being at war and waiting for his letters and whatever to let us know that he was all right.  In fact, I wonder what--at what time did Orson Wells do that Mars thing [1938]?  Was that right after the war?
Speaker 1: I think it was--I thought it was right before the war--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Was it right--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I know it was--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I, I, I know I never believed it at the time, because I happened to have been listening to the radio.  So when it came on and said, you know, ladies and gentlemen, whatever that-I, I wasn't afraid of that because I knew it was--
Speaker 1: "The War of the Worlds."
Speaker 2: "The War of the Worlds."  I knew that wasn't it.  But because of the times, so many people were frightened by that broadcast.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but you know, you--it did touch children, as this war does touch children.  If you talk to some of these young people who are killing themselves and thinking that they don't have long to live, the, the crisis that we're going through constantly, one--whether there's a conflict or a war or terrorism, that's all they've lived with, and that's why they don't fear death; in fact, some of 'em almost welcome it because of the cushit--conditions--that they're living in.  You see, it's really horrible to think about it.  And I think it's, I think it is non-racial.  It is just people.  The man's inhumanity, the man has spread so far that you can't trust anybody.  Look at the latest news about the man--I don't wanna get on this one, but just look at the, the man who was here in Chicago, who now they have found was gonna make a dirty bomb.  And he had citizenship here and all.  And then people don't wanna be searched at the airport.  We'd better wake up and find out what's happening, that we do have to have more guidelines and more directions and more--well, I guess it's censorship to a point when you go to airport you do have to face those kind of security reasons, the security things.

Speaker 1: Now, now did the war affect the kind of activities that you all had in high school, or, or did you--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It did to this point.  My, my graduation class had two together, rather than us having our own graduation.  Forty-four [1944] in January is when I in--when I graduated.  In '45 [1945] books were together because of the economic cost of them and the children being, you know, unable to pay for a graduation separately.  And also, at that time, the white kids had their own graduation, and the black kids had their own graduation.  Racism, we call it--
Speaker 1: From the same high school?
Speaker 2: From the same high school.  We had two proms.  Not--yeah, two proms--not graduations, two proms.  I said graduations--
Speaker 1: This is--
Speaker 2: --but I meant proms.
Speaker 1: This isn't Georgia.  This is Chicago--
Speaker 2: This is Chicago, Illinois, where they'd all was called the most racist city, as we know.  It probably still is in many ways, even though there are many opportunities here for us.
Speaker 1: And this is--what's the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: Englewood High School.
Speaker 1: Englewood High School (unclear).  At that time, it was--
Speaker 2: It was, it was highly rated for its educational a, acquirements for the students.  We had to have Spanish.  You know, we had courses that were preparing you for college, and you had to pass them.  Civics was the, was a, a course too, and that was to keep you abreast of what was going on in the world.  And of course, you had to have geography in grammar school so that when they started talking about civics in high school you knew where thing were happening.  You could visualize South Africa.  You could see France.  You'd go to the map and point it out.  You could hear Belgium.  You could see where [Winston] Churchill was speaking from.  You could see Germany and know that that was [Adolf] Hitler was.  Kids today don't even know where they're living in Chicago on a map.  But you had to name the states.  You had to name the capitals, and you had to know something about where was the growth of the region, whether they were--whether farmlands were there, whether it was industrialized or whatever.  You learned something about your country.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, where, where was Englewood High School at?  I know there's a new one now, but is, is--
Speaker 2: On Stewart.
Speaker 1: --is it the same?
Speaker 2: Same, Stewart.
Speaker 1: Same place?
Speaker 2: Un-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, Stewart and 63rd.
Speaker 2: 63rd and Stewart, right.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Used to take the elevated ['L' train] there.  That was the mode of transportation if you didn't walk to school.  And what you did was--my--what I did, my family gave me an allowance every week.  And it was up to me, when I got in high school, whether or not I wanted to walk to school or save the carfare and do what I wanted to do with it, which was mostly eat French fries and hot dogs of course.  But the walk then was not--you--we coddle our children now because we have to, we're so afraid of what will happen to them if we don't take them to school many times.  But you know, a gang of us would walk to school together.  You knew when you walked maybe a half a block that someone else was coming out the door to join, so maybe six or seven kids would end up walking to school together.  And then you would meet up at the end of whatever period you were dismissed from and meet up on a corner, and you all would walk home together.
Story_ID: 56433
Speaker 1: So do you think there was more freedom for our children then, I mean our young pe--people in those days?
Speaker 2: I think it was more--yes, I think it was more freedom 'cause there was less fear of your neighbor, so certainly there was more.  And more neighbors were looking out for one another.  There was always--at that time we had gangs though now, but the gangs weren't carrying guns.  The gangs were carrying maybe a stick or something like that.  And I guess some of the kids did have knives, but this type of terrorism that they're inflicting on one another was really not heard of.  And gangs were as they are now I think to some kids who--and remember, all kids--the Depression was on, so some of the Depression kids did not have a solid home.  They had door keys and latch door keys or something else, and so kids who watched out for one another sometimes became a part of a gang.  So at that time, you know, I think too, as I look back at it, we had other people who were interested in seeing that kids had a good time.  We had McKee Fishu (ph.), who gave teen dances.  They gave contests for the prettiest girl or the best dancers, and they gave trophies and things like that.  And they were good wholesome entertainment for kids who were out in high school or beginning in college, but mostly for high school kids.  And you went to those things.  You went to the ballgames.  You cheered for your school.  My school colors were purple and white, and I mean, we were noted not so much for our aca--not so much for our sports abilities, but for our academic achievements.
Speaker 1: What were the, what were the top high schools in Chicago [Illinois] in terms of academic achievement?  Englewood would be one--
Speaker 2: Englewood [High School], Hyde Park [High School], [Francis W.] Parker [High School], and let's see.  That's all that comes to mind for me now.  Those are the ones that we knew, you know, that we knew, since we were in a sort of a like a--we didn't go too far out of the neighborhood so that most of the kids went to those schools that you went to.  And of course, Dunbar [High School] was a high school; [Wendall] Phillips [High School] was a high school, but they were not the schools that you were talking about.  And DuSable [High School] came on the scene too, you know, a little bit.  But Dunbar and Phillips were high schools in our neighborhood.  That's the word I'm trying to find, in our neighborhood.
Story_ID: 56434
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so, so you were like live--living further south--
Speaker 2: Further south.
Speaker 1: --south of the traditional--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --black community--(simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: Well, for a while there--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --when we moved 310 East 57th Street, we had moved from 47th--no, 49th, right at 50th and what was called South Parkway.  You know, there's a statue in the middle of King Drive now that has Washington on a horse.  That statue used to be a dividing the street, not at the circle that it is in now.  It was sort of a meeting place at the end of that corner.  And right in front of that was called the Grand Hotel, and that's where Joe Louis used to go and have his hair cut.  And as a kid, I remember rushing up there to see Joe Louis, fighting to get a good spot to look at him, and selling my spot when I got through looking for two or three pennies to get out of the way for somebody else to look into him to see.  And that was where all of the--well, they were--sportspeople hung out at.  So that was something to see, those sportspeople, and to know them name and have them acknowledge you.  You know, the kids would be waving to one another.  But when Joe Louis came on the scene, oh my God, the whole neighborhood was in an uproar.
Speaker 1: What about some of the other sports celebrities?  Were, were the Negro League ballplayers celebrities in the, in the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Well, I'll tell you what, all that I can remember about that was when they would come to town, they were at the--I think it was the stadium where my mother [Abia Wimbush] would take me where they had the Negro League play.  Of course you know they weren't invited to the Major Leagues then, so there would be two teams in opposition.  And I can't remember the names of them, but yes.  We had a picture of us attending one of those games, and would you believe we had hats and gloves and purses on and high-heel slippers?  High-heel shoes going to a sports event, but they were sharp.  The men had wide hats with bands on and zoot suits and everything, going to see the black athletes, the black ballplayers, yes.
Speaker 1: Those are major social events?
Speaker 2: It was a major social event, and everybody went to it; we crowded.  I remember, I remember my mother in a green corduroy outfit.  Oh, I thought she was about the cat's meow, as they used to say, in that outfit, going to see the black athletes play.
Story_ID: 56435
Speaker 1: And what about music?  Was music popular in your neighborhood or did you--did--
Speaker 2: Was it?  Music--
Speaker 1: --did, did you like music?
Speaker 2: Was music popular?  Well, I'll tell you again about school, what was so good.  At school we had all kinds of--it was not opera, but we had some symphony music exposure.  We had some black spiritualists exposed to us through Mrs. Robinson, and naturally we were playing our--what's that called, a 45 records then--a 45 records.  I remember being a fan of Little Green.  Little Green had a song called "In the Dark," and actually that's the first record that I remember that my mother thought was a little bit too much mature for me and didn't allow us to play, but "String of Pearls" and Duke Ellington at that time and the Count [Basie], all of that.  Yeah, we liked all of that music was going on.  We were dancing to that.
Story_ID: 56436
Speaker 1: Did, did, did your family ever attend the Regal Theater?
Speaker 2: The Regal Theater?
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 2: Let me tell you about going to the Regal Theater.  You got dressed going to the Re--I don't understand how these children dress now going anywhere, but you got dressed going to the Regal Theater.  And at that time they did not have you put out at the end of a show.  So you could go to the Regal in the morning for the first show, and you could sit in that seat all four shows, so it's almost like you got the know the routine.  And the black--the--ooh, what, what is it called?  The vaudeville was going on then, and you saw all of the vaudeville acts, as well as the top stars, and they would have--they would be sharply dressed.  And I definitely remember Duke Ellington being clean.  He'd come out in white tux, Cab Calloway.  I even saw Josephine Baker there I think with her last--one of her last appearances in Chicago [Illinois].  Oh, this was way--even though I saw Aretha Franklin, this is even before then.  There was a man named Ralph Cooper, who was a black movie star.  You know, black movie stars in those days and what we thought was handsome, you had to be real light like Cab Calloway and have straight hair.  Well, he had all that, and he was a matinee island--idol--one of the matinee idols; Nina Mae McKinney; I saw Louis Armstrong.  Louis Armstrong's wife was Lil, Lil.  Lil [Hardin] Armstrong, she played the piano; Butterbeans and Susan [sic, Butterbeans and Susie].  Why are these names escaping me?  Yes, I was there.
Speaker 1: But they did--a group would come in and they would do four shows in a day?
Speaker 2: Four shows a day.
Speaker 1: And you could sit there and watch all four of the sh--
Speaker 2: You could sit there and watch 'em, that's right.
Speaker 1: And how much did it cost to get in?
Speaker 2: Probably a quarter, mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And did, did, did they show movies and live entertainment at the same time?
Speaker 2: Yes, you saw a movie, and then they'd come back and do another show.  And it was the same show.  That's why when they told a joke, you laughed before the joke was complete because you already knew it.  But you, but you, but--see, like we get bored with TV now, you didn't get bored.  I don't--this--
Speaker 1: Because it was live?
Speaker 2: It's--maybe because it was live.  And when they came back, you went back to see them again.  And they told the same old jokes, but you knew the routine, and you loved it, and you laughed.  I saw Bill "Bojangles" Robinson.  I'm trying to remember how old I was at that time.  But you know who made the most impression on me, made me wanna be an actress?  Was Ethel Waters, and I don't remember what she was in, whether it was a just--whether she was just appearing, and I don't think it was at the Regal.  I think it was--I don't know where it was, but she was in concert somewhere.  And my mother, who loved to take me to things, she was a young woman.  I was only--she was only sixteen when I was born, so you know she was still a kid.  And as she got older, she loved to go to that kind of entertainment, and she would take me.  And I definitely remember getting an autograph from Ethel Waters, and I thought she was-- something that I wanted to do was to be on stage, so later on I joined the Skyloft Players in an attempt to be an actress.
Speaker 1: Isn't--this is probably unusual, but I, I just, I just wondered, you're tall and Ethel Waters was nice and tall, so did--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --did you--this have an im--impact on you?
Speaker 2: I don't think so because I, I, I--though I did get her autograph, it was not like I recognized her height or anything.  Like Maya Angelou is a tall woman.  Of course, I've grown myself now and I know that she's tall, but I don't think that her height impressed me, no, but her talent and her looks on the stage.  Well, she was still a very pretty woman at that time and very talented, stage presence and all.  But I was glad to be exposed to theater, because theater was something that you saw our people doing that required talent and that you knew that you could be that performer and be that fulfilling to other people through the art.
Speaker 1: So you see--people saw other black people achieving excellence in person, and they knew that they were--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --they were world-class in whatever they were doing.
Speaker 2: That gave you a chance to emulate them and not only have the white figures of the models and whatever, but to have black people who you thought were pretty, who were well-dressed, and you wanted to be like that.
Story_ID: 56437
Speaker 1: Did you--were you involved in, in drama or, or performing arts in high school?
Speaker 2: Well, at Englewood [High School, Chicago, Illnois] we had something called the Snow Hut.  And I did a little skit called "Minerva"--"Mabel."  And it was like a telephone conversation, something much like Lily Tomlin did when she first got started.  And I don't where I got that idea from, but I made up a skit talking to another kid on the telephone, and it was "Hello Mabel."
Speaker 1: Can you remember any of it?  Can you do it--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No, I cannot do that.  I--maybe if we keep on talking, I'll think about it.  But it was certainly about boys and what we were gonna wear and that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, well, if you, if you can think of some of it, it ought to be interesting--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: If I think of some of it, I'll try to--but that's been years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now what else did you do in high school?
Speaker 2: Well, actually I was in the debate class, and I loved that.  And I remember, I remember that we worked hard to become the best debate team when we would have contests.  And then I--since I did some--since I was kind of long and kind of lanky and--I think that I turned to humor to keep from feeling--a string bean is what they used to call me, so I turned to humor.  And in, in, in turning to humor, I became a little actress and got into those things.  So I was in everything that had anything to do with talking and movement; you believe me I was there.  So I think that helped develop my personality that later on became one that gets along well with people, loves people, and liked to do things for people.  I like to make people happy.  I like to be able to help them.  I guess this goes back to--you know, you made me--you're making me think of lot of things.  When I was a youngster, I dreamed that I owned a, a home that was in the country and that I had friends coming all the time.  And I'd say that, but you don't have to pay; just have a good time.  I remember that vividly now that we're talking.  And I think that I like to have people come to my home now.  I've always had little, little parties and things like that, and it was--it's always been a pleasure to be surrounded by friends having a good time.
Story_ID: 56438
Speaker 1: Who were some of your friends at Englewood?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, there was one named Jack Bright.  Jack Bright was a white fellow who--I think he became the president of the class.  There was a Mel Brooks.  But you know what?  At that time, they were so afraid that the black children would interface with the white children so--and we each of course went our own way--that nev--na, not many marriages or romances were ever blossomed between those sects and those--in our colors, that I really don't remember having any one special friend except Mel Brooks, who I've seen recently in a few, few years ago, but we never kept up in touch with one another.  Another girl named Darnette (ph.) Miller, who was a very shapely young girl.  She, she was the Shriners' twirler-bBaton twirling was a big thing, you know--and she died very young, though.
Speaker 1: Okay, were these, these white kids or were they black?
Speaker 2: No, they're black.
Speaker 1: They're black.
Speaker 2: Those names there that I just gave you--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --were black kids, un-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, those--Darnette was one of the girls I used to walk to school with.  She lived--like I lived 310 East 57th Street, she lived 4-something East 57th Street, so she was one of the first girls that we picked up on our way to school.
Speaker 1: Did you have any memorable high school teachers or, or--
Speaker 2: Well, I remember Mrs. Cooper.  Mrs. Cooper was a, was an old maid, what we called an old maid at that time, and again, that was during the time before the Depression.  You knew the seasons by the dresses that she wore.  She didn't have that many clothes, but she was always well-groomed.  And when the spring would come, she would put on this spring dress and whatever else.  And she was a very rigid lady, but very friendly after you got to know her.  And she seemed to take a liking to me, and she would keep me sitting in class and talking to me about the fact that I had so much personality, so much to offer.  She thought that someday I would be heard from.  And she couldn't tell me what she thought I would be heard from in, 'cause remember, at that time I wasn't that good at anything (laughter).  I was just a jack of all trades, doing what I wanted to do, but I did have a lot of self-confidence.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: So Mrs. Cooper I definitely remember as an encouraging person.
Story_ID: 56439
Speaker 1: Can you remember, is there any particular event or incident in high school that really stands out as--you know, when you look back on your high school days?
Speaker 2: As I look at it, I don't think there was anything very special about any day that I can remember.  I do know that there was a teacher who taught civics.  I remember this--that was removed from the classroom because they said she was Communist.  That, that--when I went to school that day--I can't think of her name--and she was no longer there, that's the stigma they had attached to her, that she was Communist.
Speaker 1: Well, did you have any idea at the time what a Communist was?
Speaker 2: I don't think that we thought it was anything--I guess we, we connected Communism with--was it Russia or--no, we--the way she taught us about it was as if it was a good thing because everybody lived well, and everybody supported each other, and everybody growed fruit, fruits and plants and--you know, not fruits, but, but food together and shared.  So she did put a, a romantic spin to the Communist Party, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, but, but you had a--so, so you had a more positive view of it.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And then when she was expelled from the school, were, were, were you shocked at somebody--
Speaker 2: Oh, definitely we were shocked.  You know, but, but we knew too--you know, when--we sort of knew that it was not the popular thing to be in America, so yes, it was discussed among kids as to why was that wrong.
Story_ID: 56440
Speaker 1: So, what were your thoughts come graduation time from high school [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois]?  Did you, did you have any idea what you wanted to do or what you wanted to be?
Speaker 2: Well, I'll--I, I went to [Woodrow] Wilson Junior College [now Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois] upon graduation, but I was never had my mind on--I had one time had thought I wanted to be a nurse.  But by the time I graduated from high school, I didn't wanna be a nurse.  So I, I didn't actually know what I wanted to be, except I wanted to do some artwork.  I thought I wanted to be in the theater more than anything else.  I thought I wanted to carry Mabel on to famous heights in the theater.  Yeah, so that was, that was more or less what I thought I wanted to do.
Story_ID: 56441
Speaker 1: -- talking about [Woodrow] Wilson Junior College [now Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois].  You attended Wilson Junior College--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and you said before that you had thought about becoming a nurse, but you changed--
Speaker 2: I had been--I was very young at that time.  Yeah, a nurse was such a help to mankind, you know, serving and being a Florence Nightingale.  I think most of the girls did, 'cause there was something on the radio about a--maybe it was a Florence Nightingale story, and I think that affected a lot of us at that age.
Speaker 1: So a lot of, lot of the young women of your generation thought about service?
Speaker 2: Well, because of those radio shows, you know, yeah, I think so.
Speaker 1: Okay--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: The war [World War II] coming on too.  That was sort of like the wax and the glamorous nurses giving up their time and--what was that other movie?  You know, they showed a lot of movies that then too nurses had roles in 'em, didn't have so many, many leading men, so the women had strong parts.
Story_ID: 56442
Speaker 1: Okay, so what did you eventually end up focusing on at [Woodrow] Wilson [Junior College, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well, I did the same thing that most kids do.  I took the easy courses.  And I only went a year, so Wilson was something like a test for me to see whether or not my--for my mother [Abia Jenkins] to see whether I was really college bound or just wanting to say I went to college.  And a lot of it was I just went to college.  'Cause then my thing was I really wanted to be in the theater, and the next thing was I wanted to get married.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, did, did you have a, a boyfriend then or?
Speaker 2: Well, I wasn't such a, such a big dater, but I thought that that was the--next to a career, marriage--like I had seen my parents, marriage was the thing for you to do, to have children, to raise a good family, and to be good Christian people, so forth and so on, and that was it.  Since I didn't have a career as a nurse, and since I could do some theater, even as a married person, dabble in it, you know, so marriage was sort of like the way the go.  And servicemen were, were asking you to marry 'em, just to say--have somebody to say goodbye to 'em (laughter).  So it wasn't hard to be engaged or hard to be asked to be married.
Speaker 1: Well, did one ask you?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was asked several times.  Are you kidding?  I went to the train station so often, waving 'em off (laughter), sure.  It was--I wasn't that serious about it though, but, but I think it was almost like a duty to have a boyfriend who was going into the service.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: And remember, boyfriends those days were just kisses and holding hands and walking through the park or walking home at night or whatever.  Wasn't--it wasn't pre-marriage--or relationships like they have now; that was out.  Your mother and father saw to that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were chaperoned a lot or they--
Speaker 2: If you weren't chaperoned, you would--it was so close to it (laughter); you had restrictions on you.  And, and listen, I thought my mother had eyes in back of her head.  I know she had friends who told everything.  I remember on my way to school one time there was a building that had real shiny mailboxes in it; it was like a mirror.  And my mother didn't know I wore lipstick.  Well, at the Walgreen's store--not Walgreen's--it was Woolworth's stores then, a five and dimes.  They would have a basket with used lipsticks in it.  That was before that was taboo.  And you would buy a lipstick maybe for three pennies that had been sampled by someone else.  So I bought one of those and had it in my schoolbag, and I'd go into this lobby and put on lipstick.  And of course I stopped, same place, and we took our lipstick off.  When you get home you didn't have on any lipstick.  So I got home one day, and my mother asked me about it, and of course I didn't know what she was talking about (laughter).  So a neighbor had seen us putting on this lipstick in this lobby.  So, you know, people then were not afraid to tell your parents when they saw you doing wrong.  So again, that's what the type of neighborhood I was raised in.  Everybody looked out for each other, and so the same way about you and a boyfriend.  You couldn't go anywhere that you didn't know somebody, so you were not acting out of good conduct when you were with a young man.
Speaker 1: So did you meet someone then that, that--at that age that you--
Speaker 2: That I--
Speaker 1: --or did you pursue the theater?  I mean what happened next?
Speaker 2: Well, I married quite young.  Well, you, you know, that was in my er--late--early--I think I was twenty-something years old, twenty-one or -two, so that was right after the war.
Story_ID: 56443
Speaker 1: Okay, was that, that while you were going to [Woodrow] Wilson [Junior College, Chicago, Illinois] or--
Speaker 2: No, no, I had stopped school by that time.
Speaker 1: When you stopped going to school at Wilson, what did you do then?
Speaker 2: Actually I went to California.  My, my--we had a family members out there, and I went to California.  And I lived in California for two years.  And again, that was because it was glamorous, and my family out there were with the [International] Sweethearts of Rhythm.  Have you ever heard of that group, the Sweethearts of Rhythm?  The Sweethearts of Rhythm was from Piney Wood College.  And you know about Piney Wood College [sic, Piney Woods Country Life School, Piney Woods, Mississippi], maybe?
Speaker 1: In, in Mississippi.
Speaker 2: And they were the troupe that made the rounds raising money for Piney Wood.  So, two of my aunties on my father's side--my blood father's side--lived in California.  And I wanted to be out there 'cause I thought I could get out there and get with the, the, the little theaters, and I did.  I, I, I worked at the Y[WCA?], at which had a little theater group, and did that kind of thing.  And would you believe I worked for one month for Lucille Ball?  Lucille Ball was making a movie called "The Long, Long Trailer."  And one of my girlfriends was her maid.  And she was taken ill, and so she asked me to take her place.  So I worked for Lucille for about a month.
Speaker 1: Yeah, "The Long, Long Trailer," that was a big blockbuster movie in those days.
Speaker 2: That's right.  I got to see the, I got to see them sh--shoot part of it, and it was so glamorous to me; met Lena Horne, who was absolutely beautiful.
Speaker 1: In--so what--why didn't you stay in California?  Did your--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, my mother [Abia Jenkins] didn't want me out there by--with my family and by myself and whatever else, so I came home.  She was constantly talking about me coming home.  I didn't have a career, so I wasn't doing too much of, you know, value.  So my mother wanted me to come home, get back in my church and find myself, as she say, to do something that was constructive rather than just being in California trying to be in the, in the arts and whatever else.  So I came back home, and she was right.  I met my husband [Haymon Passmore] when I came back home.
Story_ID: 56444
Speaker 1: And so, so you got married and--
Speaker 2: So I got married in 1949.
Speaker 1: Forty-nine [1949], okay, all right.
Speaker 2: We only had a six-month courtship.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now, how did you meet your husband [Haymon Passmore]?
Speaker 2: I was a manicurist.  I had become a manicurist while I was working for Lucille [Ball] and all.  I got into that cosmetic part of the industry.  And so I became a manicurist in what was supposed to be one of the better shops, men shops, barbershops in Chicago [Illinois], and one day he came in for a manicure.  So I met my husband by holding his hand the first time I ever met him.  And he asked--he came back the next day and asked me for another manicure.  I said wait a minute, something's not right here 'cause I know I do a good job.  He said but I'd like to take you out, so that was it.  So I lived only a few blocks from the barbershop, so he walked me home.  And I said to myself, now something is wrong with this picture because I had fellows who got cars.  What am I doing walking home with a fellow and don't have any car (laughter).  Later on in life though he gifted me with four cars, so must have been the right guy.
Story_ID: 56445
Speaker 1: So when you were in California did you go to--is that when you went to Long Beach (unclear) or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's when I went to Long Beach City College [Long Beach, California].  But again, I just dabbled in college 'cause my mother [Abia Jenkins] was on my case, as the kids say, and I had to do some school, so that was it.  And then they--I thought they might have had a little drama classes too, you know, so that--in fact, I worked at a cannery for two days (laughter) at a place called--I think it was--oh, I forget the name of the little island that it was called.  But some of the kids in the school were making a little money going working as a cannery worker.  I couldn't take it.  I could not take it.  Two days was all I could take.  In fact, they still owe me the money.  I never went back and got my paycheck (laughter).
Story_ID: 56446
Speaker 1: Okay, so in, in Chicago [Illinois], here you're, you're married.  And what do you do--I mean do--are you still trying to get involved in the arts at this point?
Speaker 2: Well, not really trying to get involved with the arts.  I, I--after I was married, I was trying to be what I thought would be a good wife.  And my husband [Haymon Passmore] at that time wanted a homemaker, even though he was a railroad man.  Believe me, that was--at that point, before the railroads went out of business, that was a fairly decent job.  So he was gone most of the time, and I was home fixing up this little four-room apartment that we had.  And I've always had a little sense of decoration and taste 'cause my mother [Abia Jenkins] had that.  And so I was a little homemaker, but I was one of the women that got in little clubs.  I thought it was--I always, as I said, liked people, so they were--we had little clubs going on.  And I was re--I remember one of them was called the Modern High Steppers.  And what we did, we had little parties.  And we would car-- charge 25 cents (unclear) had a waist party and one of those kind of things that was going on at the time.  And, and, and it was just to benefit us, putting money in the treasury, and then we would give a barbecue or something.  So it was strictly social, but it was around young people who way of your age, who were of your peers who liked the things that you liked to do, and that was that.  We all supported one another in our activities, though we did not--at that time, we had not become civic minded at all.  We were just strictly social minded.  And most of my friends came out of the church.
Story_ID: 56447
Speaker 1: Was your mother [Abia Jenkins] involved in civic clubs or--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, my grandmother [Leola Wimbush] was.  I got my civic concerns from my grandmother, who was with the CNDA Clubhouse.  And at that time, the CNDA Clubhouse was located right next to the building that we lived in on South Parkway.  And that's when I got to see Mrs. Bethune [Mary McLeod Bethune]; I believe it was Mary Church Terrell; there was some other women who were prominent in civic work, and they had this house that was their meeting place.  And when they had little conventions, or not little conventions, national conventions, all those women came in and made programs.  And since I lived right next door I was recruited to be a hostess.  So I learned from my grandmother going to those kind of things how to set the tables, not just say learned how, because I was taught that at home, but fine china, crystal ware, good manners, being impressed with women of note, listening to what they had to say, and I became instilled with blackness through them.  My grandmother was a Marcus Garver [Garvey] follower, and some of them were, as you know, political at that time and for causes.  So I, I was exposed to that at that age.  And after I married, I continued in that.  I became a member of the CNDA Club.
Speaker 1: Now, now, can you say that again slowly and tell, and tell me what it stands for?
Speaker 2: I don't remember now, but it was some--all I know all these organizations were national.  And it's the one--
Speaker 1: And you said C--
Speaker 2: C-N-
Speaker 1: --N-D--
Speaker 2: --D-A.
Speaker 1: --A.
Speaker 2: Right.  Mrs. Bethune, the one that she created, and that--who is this woman now that's retiring, later on, who was her companion when she was very young, is the retiring president of it?  National Association for Black Women, that might be the name of it.
Speaker 1: Dorothy Height?
Speaker 2: Dorothy Height's organization.  Yeah, I became very active in Dorothy Height's organization in the Chicago chapter.
Speaker 1: That's the National Council of Negro--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: National Council of Negro Women [NCNW], thank you.
Story_ID: 56448
Speaker 1: I went to Washington [D.C.] for the [National Council of Negro Women, NCNW] conventions and things.  I took my young nephew--no, cousin--with me one time because I wanted him to become impressed with Washington, D.C., before he started gra--just like my family had exposed me, I took him so that he would meet her.  And he had a picture with Mrs. Bethune [Mary McLeod Bethune].
Speaker 2: So what, what was your impression of Mrs. Bethune?  I mean--
Speaker 1: My gosh, she was a god.  She was--it was unbelievable that a woman had that much power that she could go to the White House, that I could speak to her and hear her speak.  It was like--see, I had always been interested in history and, and civics, so I had read a lot--that was required of us of course--and I remember reading one time someone said that they saw [President Abraham] Lincoln's burial pass and how that affected them.  And I could relate to that experience that they had by me just listening to her and seeing these women who had on somber dresses with furs, and hats, and pearls and all this, speaking so eloquently about the black race.  And now I'm reflecting back on how that young man felt who saw the burial of Lincoln, and I'm thinking about how I feel now remembering that I was a part of that century that I saw them and that I breathed in the same room that they did and that I got my heart stirred by what they had to say.  And it affected me to the point that I wanted to serve my people too.
Speaker 2: Can you remember a personal conversation that you might have had with--
Speaker 1: No, I don't--
Speaker 2: --Mrs.--
Speaker 1: --remember any personal conversation with her.
Story_ID: 56449
Speaker 1: But I'll tell you what, later on in life, when I worked for Johnson Products Company, we did the Great Beautiful Black Women [project], which I was privileged to become the person who took it around the country.  And I occasion to call the women who were in the collection, and one of them was Marian Anderson.  So we had been trying to reach her to ask her to be at one of our receptions.  So when I called the house, I expected her secretary to answer.  You do not know how I felt when the voice of Marian Anderson said, "What can we do for you?"  She never spoke in terms of I.  Marian always used the words "we," Mrs. Anderson, I should say, always used the word, "we."  And I said, "Are you Mrs. Anderson?"  And she said yes, and I said, "I have to catch my breath, I'm so excited," and she just laughed.  So that's as close as I came to remembering an occasion that I spoke to one of those ladies.  And I still am thrilled that I did speak to her.
Speaker 2: Well, it's exciting to hear about, you know.
Story_ID: 56450
Speaker 1: What was your grandmother's name?  I don't think we, we got your grandmother's name.
Speaker 2: Oh, Leola, L-E-O-L-A.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Leola Wimbush, W-I-M-B-U-S-H.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Her mother's name was Ella, E-L-L-A, Zanders, Z-A-N-D-E-R-S.
Speaker 1: And then your, your great-grandmother was C--
Speaker 2: Sencie.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sencie Cook.
Speaker 1: That's incredible, having all the generations--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: --know 'em all.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry that I lost that picture of her.  At least I tried to find it for you all, but I haven't been able to locate it, of us (unclear) together at one of the most popular photographers of our day too.  I think it was Patterson's--Peterson's on--later on, on King Drive or I think they used to be on State Street.  Yeah, they, they took some famous pictures.  It was not Van somebody who did the pictures, but it was a, a, a, a black couple who took many pictures of black Americans in Chicago [Illinois] who have historical references because of their photos.
Speaker 1: So you had this sense of continuity I guess, you know, of generations, and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and the example is your grandmother's civic--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --activities.
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And church activities, yes.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: I grew up in Antioch Baptist Church.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so you--so, so that, that example, you know, inspired you to get involved in civic life, right?
Speaker 2: Church and civic work, correct.
Story_ID: 56451
Speaker 1: And you started off--you said you started off before with small social clubs and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --parties.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And how did you get involved in, in the more serious type of social activities?
Speaker 2: Well, I think by the joining organizations that had more of a civic philanthropic glean to it and doing different work rather than just planning parties, you begin to plan big affairs where money could be raised.  I was in the--I started with the NAACP.  I was with the--oh, let me think of the name of the organization was here in Chicago [Illinois] that was so popular at one time.
Speaker 1: Joint Negro Appeal.
Speaker 2: Joint Negro Appeal.  Thanks, Mr. [Haymon] Passmore.  Joint Negro Appeal, and then I--you know, you go from one thing, you get a little bit of--you get a little bit political because some of the people who are in there are political personalities.  And so then you see a broader need is required of you, and I found that I had the time.  Well, one of the things too was that we owned a restaurant called The Cozy Nook on 71st Street in the '70s [1970s].  And I had become--this is back to the sort of the theater-type thing and being involved in it.  And I'm not so sure that I didn't get this job through Val with Kumba (ph.) because you know, sometimes they would come looking for talent.  But anyway, I became Mrs. Pekins (ph.) Cleaners, and in becoming Mrs. Pekins Cleaners, I could talk about how to remove spots at what the Chicago Defender called the Home Shelf.  You remember that.  The Defender used to have what was called the Home Shelf.
Speaker 1: Now this is a radio show, television--
Speaker 2: No, this was a--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --a show that was live.  You'd come to it, just like coming to a convention, and they'd have booths and things.  And the different companies would have--oh, what am I trying to say?  What would they have?--booths, where they would display their wares or you know, talk to you, try to sell you products, or let you know about 'em.  (Unclear) bread with Jesse Owens was one of the persons who had a display; Winbush, who did a lot of the--do you remember Winbush?
Speaker 1: LeRoy Winbush [HM]?
Speaker 2: LeRoy Winbush, LeRoy Winbush would be the one who erected some of the booths and things.  He had a big business then, and he was one of the first black men in that, in that type of business.  Mintria (ph.) Parker and them were also in that business.  But anyway, you would go from one booth to the--pretty much like the group that I'm involved with now, and that's the Black Women's Expo.  It was an expo-type thing, drawing crowds of people.  So I would stand at this booth and talk about how to remove spots and give coupons to get discount cleaning at Pekins Cleaners.  And so my association with the Defender and some of its writers and things, Vernon Jarrett [HM] and others, who were prolific in their writing, some Mattie Smith Colin--I can't think of the other women who died most recently and for a couple of years--Marion Campbell, who was the social editor of them all.  Well, they took a liking to me because I had so much energy and gave so much of my time to things that were happening.  There was no charge, just became a volunteer.  The next thing I knew, when I opened the restaurant, they were all my customers.  And so I became involved in politics through--when the political time came, they would send out invitations and ask me to come and volunteer.  So there I was, thrown into not only the civic, but the political arena as a volunteer.
Story_ID: 56452
Speaker 1: So economically, you all are doing pretty, pretty well at this time?
Speaker 2: Oh, you mean my husband [Haymon Passmore] and I?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: We were doing fairly decent, yeah.  In fact, we were--we had grown.  My husband had--was one thing, is always a steady worker who believed in taking care of home.  So when we went into business, I went in business with my mother [Abia Jenkins] on 71st Street.  A little sandwich shop was up for sale, and she and I went in it together [The Cozy Nook].  My mother couldn't take it 'cause as proud as she was, someone asked her to wait on them, and my mother said I'm not a waitress.  I said but you're the owner, and they do everything (laughter).  So mother went home and I stayed.  And so, that's the kind of clientele that we (unclear).  The Staple Singers and their children used to be in there all the time.  There was a school called Saint Calibanus right down the street from me.  And across the street was the funeral home, Rayner Funeral Home, so they became clients that would come in, and their children when they got out of school.  I almost had a nursery, because they would drop--the kids would be coming from Saint Calibanus about, about a half a block or so, a block and a half, and they would congregate in there for a couple of hours or maybe an hour and a half for their parents to come to pick 'em up.  That was a free babysitting service.  I didn't recognize it at the time.  'Cause the kids were buying hamburgers for lunch and all that kind of thing, so it was just a little bit of a community babysit.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know exactly where that is--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, it was--High-Low was across the street from it.  And my, my mother had bought a building right next to the people who owned High-Low.  That was a changing neighborhood.  That was in Park Manor.  You know, we're skipping around quite a bit, and I hope this is interesting.  But you are picking my mind, and memories are just flooding.
Speaker 1: That's, that's good I think.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm glad.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so you're involved in a restaurant business--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --with your mother.
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And this is in the early '70s [1970s], right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 56453
Speaker 1: Now, I don't know if I'm going too fast or not, but what--how did you get involved with Johnson Products [Company]?  I mean how--
Speaker 2: Well, I was with Joint Negro Appeal, and we had a big affair.  And Mr. [George] Johnson [HM] was one of our guests.  And we had sort of like a receiving line for the members when you came in the door.  The members welcomed you and you know, told you where you could be seated and everything.  And Mr. Johnson walked up to me and said are yes Juanita Passmore?  And I said yes I am.  He said well, I wanna talk to you.  I said fine.  He said you know a little bit about cosmetics?  I said a little bit, sure I do.  He said who had you worked for?  I said that was Margarita Ward, who was the black cosmetologist in Hollywood who had made up Lena Horne's face and some of the darker women of complexion 'cause they did not have the proper colors then.  And I had become associated with her cosmetics.  I didn't know her, but I had become associated with her cosmetics and had worked with some of the models that used her name as their title for their modeling company.  So he said I understand you're pretty good at it.  I said well, I think I am.  He said I'd like for you to come and talk to me about a job.  That's the way I went to Johnson Products Company.  I had just sold my restaurant [The Cozy Nook], and I really didn't wanna work.  I had told my husband [Haymon Passmore]well, I really think I wanna lay off for a while, 'cause that was hard work.  And I liked it and all that, but--this was like in September.  So I said to him I wanted to have my holiday free.  I wanna do some Christmas shopping, and I wanna do some Christmas partying, and I don't wanna work right now.  He said well, just come and see us, so I did.  I went in and I was interviewed by, by a girl named Dorothy McConnell, who was then his private secretary.  So she said, but we need you right away because we're trying to develop a cosmetic line.  So I said--I gave her a figure then.  I said if you need me right away, I need some money.  She gave me a figure, and I said I'll take it.  It was more than I expected (laughter).  But I went to work and stayed seventeen years.
Story_ID: 56454
Speaker 1: So, so you, you developed a cosmetic line for--
Speaker 2: I helped to develop the cosmetic line and the first ads.  I did all the makeup for the first ads and that kind of thing.  It didn't hurt to have a little theatrical background in there, making up people for stages--stage appearances in those amateur theaters, by the way.  So you did know something about shading and shadows and you know, that kind of thing, colors.  Very--it was very, very interesting, 'cause we were the first to really make a line of cosmetics for black people.
Speaker 1: Now this is George Johnson [HM], right--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: George Johnson.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And when you started with Johnson, was--what--was he--did you think he was a famous per--what, was, was he a celebrity at that point or was--
Speaker 2: Well, they had just built that new building, and that's the building I worked in, the one on Lafayette.
Speaker 1: 87th?
Speaker 2: 87th and Lafayette, right.  So yes, I knew he was a comer.  I knew about the other company with Soft Sheen.  Soft Sheen was in the works too.  So I felt that where we into with Johnson Products [Company] was the coming thing for black people to do, and that was to develop things for themselves and to, to--it was a privilege to work for a company that made--that as I looked around, I saw black people in charge of things.  That is quite an experience to work for a black company, and the people who are in charge of you are black too.  So, you saw the mixes; you saw the--when you say mixes, those were the compound people; you saw the laboratory people; the scientists who worked with the colors; the people who were artists, who did the layouts and things, many of them were black; you saw that the building was designed by a black man.  So I was surrounded by intelligent blacks, blacks who were on the way up who were making a mark in our community, and that was something to be proud of, blacks who showed us how beautiful we were.  One of the first television programs that came on was called "And Beautiful."  Johnson Products sponsored that, and it was like when we were listening to the radio, listening to Amos and Andy.  Well, we were listening to--we were looking at the TV, looking at Johnson Products' "And Beautiful" with beautiful black people on it, sponsored by black people.  And our products just leaped off the shelf.  We had Bantu, Afro Sheen, Vince Colors, a black man who was in the advertising business promoting--was the promoter of that.  We hadn't seen that before.  You could not sit at your TV and see an hour full of blackness--looked at that who was producing the show.  You know, all those things, I mean my--I was thrilled and still am to have been part of that generation that created that kind of a feeling in the black community and awareness of how beautiful we really were.
Story_ID: 56455
Speaker 1: You've had a--your life has included a rich variety of service activities, and they've basically been focused in the black community.  Do you--what's your philosophy about that?
Speaker 2: Well, I felt, and still feel, that we need people to serve our community in any way that they can, especially in being volunteers and role models and philanthropy to our own organizations, and I've tried to serve that community in that way.  I think that when you do that, you help everybody.  I've been with the--when I worked for Johnson Products [Company] and wanted to test the colors on skins, I said let's go into the projects and see what these girls think about the product.  And let them help me select something, because when we come out on the--on it, I want them to have had a part in making this company successful.  You don't know where they're going to go, but we know they're gonna be here and there's gonna be plenty of them.  That is your potential customer, so let's give them--then I went to the society groups; I went to the Links; I went to the other clubs and had demonstrations with them so that I felt that I had a variety of black women from all ethnic--no, not from all--ec--economic backgrounds and social backgrounds, as a part of creating these colors.  So I just feel that whatever you can do in your neighborhood, you should do it.  We have arts, we have artists, we have performers of all kinds that need to be recognized and encouraged.
Story_ID: 56456
Speaker 1: And you can encourage them by creating fa--scholarships; you can encourage them by being there for them; you can encourage them by serving commit--on committees that are for the underprivileged, like I was invited by Dr. Carol Adams [HM], who you know, to do something for what we call Mama Said program, which was all down at Ida B. Wells.
Speaker 2: What's the name of it again?
Speaker 1: Mama Said.  And Carol, Dr. Carol Adams, who is now at the University With No Walls [University Without Walls] on 35th Street, well, she invited me into become a board member of that.  I supplied them with clothing, a graduation party, cosmetics, all the different things that, that could provide--some of them from my pockets, some of them from asking for donations for them, but to give those girls things that they really needed.  'Cause some of 'em had children, and you know, they needed to see and know that people cared about them past their first mistake and hopefully to help them to have more value for themselves and so that they could move on and become more valuable citizens, but first to learn to love themselves.  So some of this I think came from my church background.  I was born and raised in Antioch Baptist Church.  In fact, I was the first baby born when the church moved from the old Silem Church.  Oh, I guess, is it Salem?--Salem Church.  So I was the first baby born into the church, so the whole church was my family, you can tell.  So I was in the GA Girls, and when I was about ten or eleven, we were taught to teach the younger kids Sunday school.  We had little church and big church, so I was in little church teaching kids who were three and four and five.  Keeping them really was like keeping them still and all, keeping, keeping their parents from keeping them while you were downstairs.  So I think, again, my ability to work with children and see and feel for them came even through that religious experience.  Though I didn't realize that at the time, that it was a religious experience, 'cause I had to do it 'cause my family was in the church.  And there I was, the baby of the church; I was expected to be in church performing all the time, so I think that some of my willingness to help people has always sprung from that.
Story_ID: 56457
Speaker 1: Have you--I mean, why, why haven't you been a part of, like city-wide philanthropy like, you know, part of the, say, the board of the Art Institute or the board of--have you, have you, you--I, I think you--your, your efforts have been most in the black community, right?
Speaker 2: They've mostly and all in by choice.  One of the things that happened when I was directing the Great Beautiful Black Women [project] was we wanted to go to the Art Institute and have our 15 portraits exhibited.  The Art Institute turned us down and said that they, they were not the kind of art that, that they had there.  We had to go to the Cultural Center on Michigan Avenue now, which was the old library, to have our grand opening in Chicago [Illinois].  That hurt me, and I said, wait a minute, if the Art Institute of Chicago doesn't recognize this as fine art and what we're trying to do here, and to create some space in that institution for black art, I said I never wanted to do anything for them except go to the events that they have, but not work as a volunteer.  So I've never been interested in joining any of their groups.  That's part of my commitment and why.  At one time we had to fight, you know, to get these things in, in certain organizations, so I couldn't see me being a black on the board as a token.  I wanted to be on the board of something that I was really serving, and my service came back to my community.  I still feel that way.
Story_ID: 56458
Speaker 1: Do you think there are enough black people helping and giving back to the black community?
Speaker 2: Well, they tell me that black people give more money per, per their ability to give than white people do.  I don't know.  I have--I, I've, I've been told that.  Gabner (ph.) says that of the ETA Theater.  And I know that we do give generously, but I personally know that we don't give all that we can because we're not into endowments, and I think that that is the way to go.  You should endow organizations now, which means that your money and your gift of money will pass, will live past you.  And we have to see into the future now, not just for the now.  And that's one of the things that I like about being on the board of ETA, is we're building for the future.
Speaker 1: Now ETA is ETA Creative Arts Foundation?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right, and you've been a board member there since--
Speaker 2: Almost since its inception.
Speaker 1: Which is about thirty years (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think I got a--an award there for about thirty-five years I think it was.
Speaker 1: What, what, what other arts organizations do you support in the city today?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm the chairman of Jazz Unites, and that is--Geraldine de Haas [HM] is the president.  And Geraldine, in her efforts to keep alive in Chicago [Illinois] and to have Chicago recognized as the jazz city, was the first person to take the Duke Ellington Tribute down to the what's called the band shell then in Grant Park.  And since then, the other organizations that--the other organization that's white has taken it and made the jazz fest a three-day jazz fest in, in that same venue, where we have stayed in the South Shore cultural area, the cultural center here.   And that's where we do the Duke Ellington, but she's the first person to have taken it down there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so her efforts really kicked off--
Speaker 2: Her efforts--
Speaker 1: --starting with the jazz festivals.
Speaker 2: --really--that's exactly right, exactly right, a black woman who was a former singer herself with the Bey Sisters.  Her brother and sisters are called the Bey Singers.
Speaker 1: Andy and the Bey Sisters, right?
Speaker 2: Andy and the Bey Singers [sic, Andy and the Bey Sisters], that's right.  She performed in Europe a lot, and then, then she went off as a single and married Eddie de Haas who is a bass player.  So they played--they have, I'm sure you know, been a team many times, and they have two lovely children who are now in New York City.  Darius is, he's playing in something, and I just saw Aisha, her daughter, on a segment of "ER."  She had a very small part, but I did see her performing there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So she has really struggled to keep jazz alive, not only alive, but to credit Chicago with what it's done for jazz.  And you know we are--have created another institution called the jazz museum, the National Jazz Museum, and that is hopeful that we will someday build a building.  So that's where my heart is, in trying to, again, establish things (unclear) blackness in Chicago created by black people for the entire population, not just for blacks, but to--you know, we've gone so many times to see other cultures express their culture.  Why can't all people come to see us, express what is American black culture?  I think that's the way it should be.  I, I--theaters should be just as full as the Goodman Theatre is, and it shouldn't be all black plays; it should just be good plays.  But see, like ETA gives us a chance to perform, to write, to stage, to costume, all those avenues are done by young black people, some of 'em who've gone on to become professionals and on TV and other ventures in the theater.  I even remember the days of the WPA, when down on I--where--what's the lady's name, the museum, the museum?
Speaker 1: Margaret Burroughs.
Speaker 2: Margaret Burroughs had her museum down there.  And around in that area there was "A Raisin in the Sun," Lorraine Hansberry.  There was Langston Hughes, whose work I did with the Skyloft Players.  I was in a play called "Cindy Comes Home," and there was a young black actor named James Edwards who was just terrific.  I could hardly say my lines he was so good.  He went on to Hollywood and starred in a movie about black soldiers.  I forgot what the name of it was, but he died very early.  And that was when the Skyloft Players was on King Drive at 51st Street, up in the--we were called the Skyloft Players because they let us have a room at the very top of the stairs and that was the skyloft.  So that's how they became the Skyloft Players.
Speaker 1: Okay, now this is back in wa, wa--when the--
Speaker 2: That must have been in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: So you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Or not even--no, it wasn't that far.  It was, no, it was even in the '40s [1940s].  I was--that was before I went to California, so that was in the '40s [1940s] that I was in it.  There was a jazz pianist who became a great jazz pianist, Lewis Carpenter, he was in it.
Speaker 1: And so--
Speaker 2: Some other names I can't recall who--people that still live around, still live around Chicago doing things.
Speaker 1: So you've been involved in arts as a supporter and as a performer in--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, there was just a touch of performing.  I wasn't ever good at it (laughter), except for that one act that I wrote myself.
Speaker 1: Oh, what was that, what was that, the--oh, the one--
Speaker 2: The "Mabel."
Speaker 1: "Mabel."
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Can you remember any of it now?
Speaker 2: I was--I have been trying to, but I'm sorry, Larry, it hasn't come to me, the words yet, no.
Speaker 1: I think it's gon' be good.  I'm waiting for it, so (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, it's a--
Speaker 1: --(unclear).
Story_ID: 56459
Speaker 1: What about your--now you've, you've known some of the political activist in Chicago [Illinois] too, and you've been a support to some of them.  Can you, can you talk--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --about supporting political act--activists--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Activists, some of it.  Well, of course [Lutrelle] Lu Palmer [HM] stands out in everybody's mind as one of the prolific supporters of political activities.  Tim[uel] Black [HM] is another.  Now let me see, thinks--I'd like to think of some of the women.  This name is not gonna be a name that you would think, but Josie Childs [HM] has been an inspiration to many to join political activists, because she was interested in politics.  And she was a friend of mine through Joint Negro Appeal, so some of the things that I followed were her leadership into the political arena.  The first time that Harold Washington ran--I think he ran for congressman or whatever--I was involved in that.  [Mayor Eugene] Sawyer's [HM] campaign, I was involved in that.  I believe that Jesse--no, no, not Jess--yeah, Jesse Owens ran for something or something, but he had a business and I was involved in that.  He had--he became a spokesman for Wonder Bread and some other things.  And they did want him to run for public office. I do remember that.  I don't remember if he ran or not.  But again, my association with the [Chicago] Defender put me in touch with a whole lot of the political components of the, of political races and things, made me aware of the fact that we--my grandmother, too, by the way.  I knew I had forgot about this.  My grandmother [Leola Wimbush] was a Republican.  As you know, many black people were Republicans back then.  And I remember that her talking about--ooh, who was the big, big chief in the political arena at that time?
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: Oh, I can't remember his name.
Speaker 1: I don't know how far back you, you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, that was in the '30s [1930s].
Speaker 1: Hoover was--well, he was in the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: A black guy I mean.
Speaker 1: Black, oh, here in Chicago?
Speaker 2: He, he was [Mayor Richard J.] Daley's man.  They called him Daley's man.
Speaker 1: Dawson?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: William Dawson.
Speaker 2: --William Dawson, William Dawson, that's the name.  And of course Charles [Hayes HM], who later on became--who the center is named after.  Was that Charles--
Speaker 1: Hayes.
Speaker 2: Charlie Hayes, yeah.  Oh yeah, we worked with him when he was with the AA, the Automobiles Union and so was Addie Wyatt, his, his sidekick.
Story_ID: 56460
Speaker 1: So how did you, how did you contribute to these activities?
Speaker 2: Well, I was always one that believed in making flyers.  I was always one that believed in distributing, always one knocking on doors, always up introducing them, making speeches, collecting money, giving money, helping make affairs that brought in money, gave out invitations, everything that it took to get a political candidate viewed.  And certainly when [Mayor] Harold Washington became the candidate, we were in caucuses, women's caucuses, behind doors, had many meetings at my home raising money, giving money, soliciting money, because he said he would run if we got the money.  So, every chance I had I was at a political rally raising money for Harold Washington, asking friends, berating people, making them aware of the opportunity that we had to make a black man the mayor of Chicago [Illinois], the greatest city, I think, in the United States.  And what a proud time it was.  Again, having coming out of the experience of a black company [Johnson Products Company], can imagine me going to work hard on someone becoming a mayor of the city?  So see, I was surrounded by black people who were doing things, who were making history, so it was not hard for me to want to be there with them.  And remember my slogan? "Only what you do for God will stand."  I did it out of my heart because I knew and felt that what we were living in was going to be one of the eras of greatness in black history.  We had so many hopes and aspirations for black people you just had to be a part of that.  You had to make other people aware of it.  You could not sit back and just read the paper and talk about it.  You had to get involved; you had to be a part of that.  I didn't know this, but Dempsey Travis [HM] had captured a picture of me with a banner for Harold Washington that he put in his book, political something in Chicago, and I didn't know I was in that book.
Speaker 1: His political "[An] Autobiography of Black Politics".
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, and I didn't know I was in that book till someone called me up and said you in his--again, that was a highlight and has remained a highlight in my life, to be recognized in that book, have a picture of me with something that stood for something in that book.  That will go down in my family's history.  Then I was in "Who's Who in Black America" one year right under the name of Cecil Partee [HM].  That's another political name, right, Cecil Partee, and then following that was Juanita Passmore and some of the things that I had done in the political arena and never aspiring to be a candidate, but always aspiring to push and be a good soldier to the captain.
Story_ID: 56461
Speaker 1: Were, were, were you ever disappointed about activities of politicians?
Speaker 2: Yes, you are.  When you become a realist you are, because then you realize that some of the things that you had hoped for and worked for were somewhat unrealistic in the environment that we were living in.  As, as in so many times in life, you find your dream is not going to be as easy to attain because of the, of the steppingstones that you have to get there only to find that the dream is like you said, a dream deferred.  But you just keep hope alive.  As Jesse said, you just keep hope alive, hoping that, well, it didn't happen in my time, but it's going to happen; it's got to happen, and I'm glad that I had a little bit of a finger in the (unclear) to make it happen.
Speaker 1: So do you remain optimistic about change and--
Speaker 2: Well, I'll tell you what, I think on a global situation I'm concerned about where we're going.  My, my attention has been more now what is man about?  What is happening to human beings?  Where is our concern for one another?  Are we awakened to the fact that we're coming to the close of our days?  You go back to the biblical sense that sometimes it say these things will have been foretold, and they're happening, so it brings you closer to your god.  It brings the Bible and its lessons closer to reality to you so that you know you're living with the true and living God who has predicted these things and that all that you can do is to believe, have faith, and hope that the life that you lead reflects the god in you.
Story_ID: 56462
Speaker 1: Tell me, now, when did you leave Johnson Products [Company]?  I know I'm changing gears here, but--
Speaker 2: Well, I stayed at Johnson Products seventeen years, and I left only because I had an attack of cancer.  And I came back to work part-time.  And I worked for almost a year part-time, traveling with the paintings and traveling with the art of the cosmetics for some time.  And that took me all through the diaspora, where black people, of course, live so that our markets reach them, you know, the Caribbeans, the Bahamas, Suriname, South America, Brazil.  I was even sent to England, where they manufactured cosmetics and powders that were so--supposed to be so different and so refined, they sent me there.  I went a lot of places teaching girls who would later stand at that counters and sell cosmetics or going to the beauty shops who would use our products for hair, for straightening the hair, teaching them how to use that, as well as the cosmetics and just promoting the black company and what it meant to black people to have a line of design of hair care and cosmetics designed especially for them; and that, too--I've had a rich, full life.
Speaker 1: You enjoy traveling and, and those kind of activities--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, I did, I did, I did.  And it was only after my second bout with cancer that I felt that I, you know, it was time for me to retire.  I didn't have the energy to pack and go and do all of those things.  You know, we went to Mexico, because there are black people there.  Well, you know that the world is populated more by darker skinned people than it is white people anyway so there is plenty of territory to go in.
Speaker 1: Okay, do, do you feel different when you're in a country with, with larger populations of darker skinned people?
Speaker 2: I don't think I felt any different, because you know, being a black American, we are all, all different shades.  And so, it's almost like being at home when you see different people of different colors and the different shades that are in those colors.  But I think that when I went to South Africa there was a different feeling because many of the people in South Africa are so reminiscent of the people in my family.  I do believe that we must have come from that strain of slavery in South Africa.  My last name through marriage is Passmore, so I knew that when I got there I would have a unique name.  Much to my surprise, Passmore is as common as Smith is in, in the United States.  There were so many Passmores that (laughter) I couldn't get over it.  Every other person I met was named Passmore, and so many of them looked like my relatives.  So yeah, I think South Africa, out of the African countries that I went to, Johannesburg and Fenda--I'm forgetting some--Venda and all, were people that were just like me.  So I did feel a little different.  Nigerians have a different kind of a look.  And you know, every country would in that and is a--Africa is a country, and different parts of Africa, that country, have different looks, much like when I was in China.  There are different regions in China that you can definitely tell they came from.  Maybe, maybe they had a Mongolian look; maybe they had a Cantonesian look or whatever.  There is a difference in the people's general features that let you know what part of the country they came from, and so is that in Africa, different features.  But I don't know--when I first went to Nigeria--and the company sent me there--the first time I went to Nigerian, when I stepped off the plane I thought I was gonna be very blase - so what.  Tears started to fall.  I didn't fall to the ground and kiss it, but I embraced everybody that I saw, saying brother.  And they looked at me so strange.  They didn't feel the same way that I felt when I went to South Africa.  South Africans had this brother connection, this brother and sister connection.  But the Africans in Nigeria didn't give me that same kind of feeling.
Speaker 1: Why do--
Speaker 2: And I went at FESTAC time.
Speaker 1: Now why do you think that is?
Speaker 2: The culture that they were in domination under maybe.  That's all I can see to it.
Story_ID: 56463
Speaker 1: What, what was your most moving experience in, in, in, in your travels, or what, or what was the most impressive thing that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: One of the most impressive things is, was going to a refugee camp.  And, and I went to a refugee camp outside of Ghana just about three years ago.  And you have all these ideas about what a refugee camp--where people are solemn and starving and pitiful and whatever.  Those refugees had established, as many Africans do, sort of like a village.  And though they were to be--because there were dirt huts and--they were--then you take nothing and make something, that's what I saw in that refugee camp.  They had taken whatever little sticks and whatever little things that they had and made do with it.  They were not, say, happy, but they were anticipating freedom, of going--being let out of there.  But those people had been in--some of them were part Ethiopian; different nationalities were there for some reason.  I guess that was the reason that they were there.  They were not--I don't know what the--why they were in refugee camps.  I forgot the history of that, but nevertheless, they were all welcoming you.  They had a little church service going on.  There was hope in that community, and that, that impressed me.  Because having never had been in a refugee camp before, I thought it was gonna be all squalor, which was as plenty of it, but I didn't think I would see clean children with white diapers on.  I didn't think I would see kids playing little marble games like so many Africans play in the sand or dirt.  I thought I was just gonna see what they show on TV, starvation, hopelessness in their eyes and whatever.  So that was, that was something to see, people who came from all different cultures in that area blending together and making do.
Story_ID: 56464
Speaker 1: Now you've been involved in organizations to improve conditions in Africa.  Can you talk about--
Speaker 2: Africare maybe you're talking about.  Yes, well, several years ago Jack--[Rev] Jesse Jackson [Sr., HM]'s wife, Jackie [Jackson], who and I are good friends, was asked to create a chapter of Africare Chicago.  And after its inception, I was the second president of that chapter, and I think, and I must say the most successful one of it too.  And one of the things that we did was to help to make water--water was as--you know, we dug wells.  We built medical houses where there was medical supplies were sent, all under the direction of C. Payne Lucas [HM], who was the president of Africare.  Africare is a very strong organization.  And by the way, when I was in Ghana several years ago, about three or four years ago, before my stroke, I went to the Africare chapter and they have built villages there, and they have worked with the people, and now they're working with the AIDS population there.  Because as you know, AIDS is very prevalent and killing many people in, in Africa, so Africare is to be supported.  C. Payne is retiring now.  He's an older--he's been there so many years he's retiring.   And I just got a letter recently that someone else was replacing him.  I don't know the person by name.  But I'm waiting to see if they're gonna give him some kind of honor so that the Chicago chapter can collectively send him something to let him know that we recognize his many years of service.
Speaker 1: And this is a black organization.
Speaker 2: A black organization.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Again, I wouldn't have been puttin' all my time and effort into it had it not been a black organization.  We need--our people need to support these things.  I'm not saying that you shouldn't be in other organizations, but make your first preference your own.
Story_ID: 56465
Speaker 1: Just briefly comment on your activities with Operation PUSH.  I know that you were very involved with Op--Operation PUSH at one time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, as a young executive with Johnson Products [Company], you were asked what organization did you want to support so that you would be given time and backing.  And of course, me being one of the people who believe in the people, I wanted to be--they offered me the Urban League, which I thought was already well-funded.  And so I picked Operation PUSH, which is where, again, my heart was with the, with people who needed the kind of help that I thought we could give them and so I went there.  And after a few years I joined the Women's Board.  Adari (ph.) Zala (ph.) was the president of the Women's Board at that time, and her, her, her ideas I thought matched mine.  It was because we were inviting some very prominent people from through around the world to come and be the guest of Johnson--of Operation PUSH to be on its morning broadcast.  That was a very desirable spot to be in for politicians and all kinds of dignitaries.  And so we wanted to create an atmosphere that when people came of hostess--hosting--them and seeing that they got the little amenities that PUSH up until that time had not even thought about providing for them.  So we had fund--she had founded a little organization within the organization called the Women's Board to do those kind of things and especially to raise money for them.  So that's how I got involved with that.  Then after that, I became more aware with the raising the funds to help to restore Operation PUSH, and I was the chairman of the Restoration Committee.  And that meant that we were out to have the building appraised and assessed for what needed to be done to make the--to restore the building.  And that's--I worked on that until I was again struck with the second bout of cancer when I had to retire from some of my activities.  But I loved the idea of what PUSH is about, and I think that it has done a marvelous job in many instances in putting black products in stores that they had not been in, making blacks aware of contracts, and how to get involved in the building of the city, how to--the Trade Bureau, and rights of people and all those kind of things.  They go--[Rev.] Jesse [Jackson Sr., HM] I know hops around a lot, but I think he does a lot of good.  I don't see how people sometimes think that Jesse can be the sau--save-all, but he does bring attention to things that need to be done.  And that's when I think the communineed--communities need to get behind some of the things that he has done and make them work, 'cause he can't make everything work.  But he is, he is a, a force to be reckoned with.  I'm very sorry about some of the things that have happened to him recently, because I do believe that Jesse was inspired, gifted by God to do the work that he's doing.  But I think that Jesse's feet have a little bit of clay, and therefore we have to understand that, and just look at the bigger picture of what Jesse has done, and I believe will continue to do, and can do.
Story_ID: 56466
Speaker 1: Just in that same vein, can you give me your reflections on Harold Washington?  I mean what, what did you think about--
Speaker 2: Well, having known Harold before he became mayor and having worked in his campaigns, I thought that Harold was an astute politician who cared for the people.  I think that Harold, before he became the mayor, and I think that's the second time he ran to be mayor, wanted to make changes in our community and knew that the only way to do it was to be in a position that he was gifted to be in and that was to be the mayor.  Anything else is secondary.  The mayor of Chicago [Illinois] holds a whole lot of power, and I think that he knew this even when the opposition was so strong.  You know, he carried that one veto vote to death, so that means he was standing there for the people.  And some of the things that he did, had he had a chance to live long enough--so sorry that he was taken at that time--I think we would have seen a, a stronger Chicago for blacks.  But I really think that Harold was a--from the people.  He was a [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] in that sense.  King was a preacher and a, a pe--people person.  He gave his life for the people, and I think that in a sense Harold gave his life for us.
Story_ID: 56467
Speaker 1: Throughout all your activities, how has your family really felt about your activities?  Have they been supportive?  Do you have any children or (unclear)--
Speaker 2: I'm a--it's funny.  I believe that motherhood is born within the heart, not necessarily in the womb, so I have children, yes.  And it seems that my cousins and my in-laws' nieces and nephews have become like children to me.  One especially has (unclear)--come very close to me.  And well, I was in her life at turbulent time in the turbulent teens, so I think I had some effect on her and brought her into the community with the [Mayor] Harold Washington campaign.  She worked with me on that, and she worked with me at Operation PUSH, and she went to--like my grandmother [Leola Wimbush] had done me, took her civic operations and things.  So I think that, that' why she's very close to me.  But yes, I, I would have loved to have children, but we didn't, so I replaced the womb children with the love in my heart for other children.
Story_ID: 56468
Speaker 1: --I know you've, you've been involved in, in many organizations.  Do you have--if you had your way--let's just put it this way--if you had your way, what plan would you institute to generate more growth and activity in the community?  What would you do?
Speaker 2: Okay, well, this is, this is something that has just occurred.  I met a man named Harry Akande, who is an African out of Nigeria, who recently had an affair.  And he had since I met him became a chief in Nigeria.  I went to his home and had flown on his private plane, and we have sort of a, a good relationship.  My husband [Haymon Passmore] is, is friendly with him also.  In the meantime, about two weeks ago he had an affair that he announced what he saw in his homeland that he love dearly was a mishandling of the judgment, corruption within the government and all.  And it, and it was disturbing to him to see a once powerful or could be powerful nation slip.  And his hope is to create a third party, not that he wants to run its president, but that he would hope that a third party would help to eliminate some of the corruption.  And he's asking for the vote for the Nigerians who live in the United States to be able to vote for the president of Nigeria.  Those are so many votes that are lost.  So, when you ask me what would I do as a black person to change the condition of the black man in America.  Is that what you're basically saying to me?  Is that--
Speaker 1: Well, as the person that--
Speaker 2: --is that something like what you're saying?
Speaker 1: --you've, you've kind of phrased a little differently--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but that's--
Speaker 2: I think what I see though is not all black.  As I said to you, I think it's something about man's inhumanity to man it has gone past color now.  I think the same things when I look at Appalachian whites, when I look at the whites who would destroy America by being--with creating bombs, when I look at the sects--is that the word I want there--the sects that, that all anti-American who are living on our soil, those are the things that disturb me as much as disturbs me the black man's plight, because as long as they are anti, we will never make it.  The antis are undercover to keep disrupting, to keep America itself from moving forward.  And until this country moves forward in the direction that God would have it to go, I don't think the black man is--whoever's in charge is going to be--I look at the cities that were turned over to black mayors and the devastation that has happened there because the federal government has not come in and taken as active a part financially as they used to under white mayors.  We're, we're given some of the--or allowed I should say, to be in charge of for a while some parts of America that were on the downside when we got there.  And so then to say that we failed in our, in our efforts, puts--it seems to put, to put a black mark on the fact that we cannot rule or cannot elevate, and it's not always true.  You know, look how they fought against [Mayor] Harold Washington.  We know a little bit about that now that we probably didn't understand before.  They, they lowered our credit rating.  They do all those things when we get into governments, and you can't, you cannot raise above that.  So I don't know if, if--I guess what I'm saying is those in power have to become concerned about all people and then black man will rise.  But as long as he's sacrificing human beings in so many different ways, then they wanna keep us at the bottom of the pole.  And as long as that's gonna happen, they have to have someone to step on, and they gon' continue.  And the black man is going to continue to fight, hopefully, to ri--to raise himself.  But he, too, has to go back to God in order to fulfill what I believe is the dream of the black man coming into his own.
Story_ID: 56469
Speaker 1: Well, you certainly have, have I guess little done intense commitment.  What, what do you, what do you think your legacy will be?
Speaker 2: My legacy--is there--if, if I have a legacy, I think what my legacy is what I'm saying to people of my generation and of my financial ability, to do what I've done, to become aware that you're necessary in your community, and serve your community.  That's very important to me, very--buy homes, buy businesses, learn to make the business the best of its kind in competition with anything.  And we, on the other hand, need to learn to support those businesses.  Black people need to go back to the '30s [1930s] when they could not go downtown, when the white man's ice wasn't in competition with black ice, and stay in our communities, support our communities, teach our communities, train our communities, train our children to go to our, our houses--of our restaurants, like the black theaters and whatever else.  I believe in expansion for the entrepreneur.  But for the people who support the entrepreneur, let's support blackness.
Story_ID: 56470
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that's what I'd like to be remembered as, someone who tried to make us alert to the fact that we had to support one another, by doing it myself.
Speaker 1: Setting an example.
Speaker 2: By setting that example, that's right.
Story_ID: 56471
Speaker 1: What would you think--I mean, or how did you--how did your mother [Abia Jenkins] like, feel about your activities or your grandmother [Leola Wimbush]?  Did they, did they, they, they get a chance to see your really get, get, get, get involved in your role?
Speaker 2: In a, in a sense.  My grandmother died in her sixties, and so she really didn't get to see me doing as much as I later on became quite known in our community for doing.  But she was proud of me to be in business.  She was proud of me that I was a family person, always was, you know, helping someone in my family.  For instance, my little niece who was--had a very bad case of eczema, my--[aunt] Dazzle's daughter--when I was seventeen, nineteen I had a little job, and I was paying for her piano lessons because her mother couldn't afford them.  So my grandmother was glad to see me doing that kind of thing and showing that much love for, for family.  In fact, she, she, she was a prophet almost to a degree, because when my--when Jacqueline, the girl I paid for the piano lessons, became pregnant, I was upset.  It was too early for her to become pregnant I thought.  And I had only been married a couple of weeks.  And so, while I was fussing at her about it, my grandmother told me, she says, I want you to be that baby's godmother because you might never have any children.  And he became my godchild, and my husband accepted him as our godchild, and he's been very close to us, and true enough, we haven't had any children.  So she was glad to see me take that kind of interest in, in my kinfolk.  And I am very orientated to kin people.
Speaker 1: And still have a lot of relatives (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, I have quite a few.  Not as many--and I--we, we don't--I try to bring them together.  I created a Thanksgiving about seven years ago to bring us all together, and we had fifty-some people in attendance at that one.  And now my--a cousin of mine is having a picnic out at South Shore Country--well, South Shore Community Hall, whatever it's called, over there on 71st Street.  And he's bringing a picnic now, so we, we do try to come together.

Speaker 1: Okay, this one final question: How do you--what do you think about this kind of a project, this oral history project that we're--other than to tire you out.  I mean what's (laughter)--what, what do you think about it?
Speaker 2: Long overdue.  Because many times we say to each other, and I know I said it to my mother [Abia Jenkins], I wanna tape you.  And I kept putting it off and never doing it.  So, I'm sorry I've--I do her voice on tapes, but I wanted to do a video with my mother and I never did.  And I think that a lot of times we postpone, postpone, postpone and it never happens, so this is good for us to do.  And I think it's good because you're not only taking people who might be names in the community, but who have done something, who have been the shoulders that, that, that you stand upon or have been role models or examples in so many walks of life and that you have never heard of.  And another thing I think is, when I was young, when they asked you who, you know who your hero was?  It was your mother and your father.  I became alarmed when we asked children who was their hero and they would say Michael Jordan or some famous name, people they had never met and never had any--would never know.  How could that be your hero?  What had happened to the heroes who brought you up?  What kind of role models were they that you could not relate to them as a hero in your life?  Somebody in your family was not a hero?  My great-grandfather was a hero from a story that we were told.  He worked on the railroad on one of those--laying tracks.  And the only way they could get home was to ride the fat cars with two men pumping--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --at the end of a week.  They would have to pump their way back home down in Georgia.  My grandfather did that.  And his children, who were in this one room sleeping under homemade quilts would hear their mother or their grandmother greet him with kisses and hear them embracing each other in lovemaking.  That was some of their memories of what family and love was about.  He was a hero to them.  That to me is where the legacy and the heroes should be, within your home first, and then reach out for others.  For the heroes that you know, you should honor them.  And so this legacy to me I hope I've honored my generation of who's gone on before me because I know them  and feel that I have spoken of them as a memory for my other families--for other families to know that heroes are in their family.
Speaker 1: Thank you, Mrs. Passmore.
Speaker 2: It's been my pleasure.

Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay, this was at a reception that was held for the television program for Channel 11 and that Lou Rawls was the star of the show, and so that's at a reception.  That's myself on the left with a girl named Natalie Presi--Puryear, who is now the vice president of Black United Fund.  That's Lou Rawls and a person I don't know the name of.  I don't know her name.  That was in 1980-something.
Speaker 1: That was me at the age of sixteen, when my family gave a coming out party.  We didn't call 'em debutante balls.  We called them coming out.  Coming out was a little bit before you were a debutante.  You were--in my family and group and you were allowed to date at sixteen, so you had a debut a little bit later, 'cause then that meant you were ready for big society and ready to become married.  But that was just your introduction to first dating.
Speaker 2: That's me, Juanita Passmore, again.  And I was about twenty-four or -five at that time.  And that was a glamour shot.  I was tempted to become a photographer's model and had worked with Cleo Johnson, who had a modeling school.  So I was hopeful to be a photographer's model.  Blacks were just coming into the awareness of their own beauty.
Speaker 1: What year do you suppose this was?
Speaker 2: That's 1962 or 3, something in that order.
Story_ID: 56474
Speaker 1: I was twenty-two or -three, and that's a wedding portrait made by the famous Patton, photographers in Chicago, Illinois.  That was the famous studio.  They did very fa--oh, a lot of--if you didn't have your picture made at Patton's, you hadn't had a picture made.  Right, they also made you, they beautified the pictures.
Speaker 2: Okay, left to right, that's myself; that's Jewel Lafontant [MANkarious, HM], who was a famous attorney and ambassador to the United States--from the United States.  I forgot what country she represented; that's Reverend [Desmond] Tutu; and I think that's an--I think that's--I don't know.  I'd better not say.  I'd better not say.  You know that's Reverend Tutu at a reception, right--don't know his name now.
Speaker 1: This was west, west, (unclear)--wait, Westchester, Massachusetts is it?  I was accepting the keys to the city from the mayor of Westchester at that time.  That was 1980-something, 1980-something at a reception.  I was given the keys to the city for bringing the pictures, The Great Beautiful Black Women into town, a product by Johnson Products.  So that would be good to say Great Beautiful Black Women Exhibit was brought to Westchester.  And that was given--I was given the keys to the city.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Well, that's 1987, around there.  That's Jackie Jackson.  That's--oh, you want me to go the other way.  What is reverend's name now?  I have to think of his name.  The girl next to him is Jewel--is Geraldine Lambert, she's a real estate.  Her whole family is in real estate.  She's made a very successful realtor.  That's myself, and that's Jackie Jackson, Reverend Jackson's wife.  And he was Reverend--oh God, what is his name?  I don't know.
Speaker 2: Do you remember the year this would have been taken and what the occasion was?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's, that's, that's another reception for--we were engaged in a project for Africare.  And he was one of the persons in attendance at the reception for the program that we were promoting at that time.
Speaker 2: Okay and what year was the Africare or this particular--
Speaker 1: That's 1987 or '91 [1991], between '97 [1997] and 90--'81 [1981]--'91 [1991].
Speaker 2: Okay, that's Juanita Passmore when I was inducted as a commissioner of the city of Chicago, and I was made the president of the local improvements board under Mayor Harold Washington.  That year--what year was Harold in?
Speaker 1: That was in the '80s [1980s] too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  Let's say 80--in the '80s [1980s] under Harold Washington's Administration.
Speaker 1: Well, again, here's my varied activities.  I was chairman of the board of Jazz Unites.  And that is Ahmad Jamal doing the autographing.  And the girl there is Leona Black, who is now the secretary for Donne Trotter, State Senator Donne Trotter.  That, too, was after one of his performances and an autographs section--an autograph session rather.  And as the chairman of the Jazz Unites, I was hosting him.
Speaker 2: Great, year?
Speaker 1: That would be 1990.
Speaker 2: This is 19 and '93 [1993].  That's in the Holocaust, Holocaust Museum in Jerusalem [Israel].  That's on one of my many travels.
Speaker 1: Well, out of our varied friendships, this is a picture made in Milwaukee [Wisconsin] at a reception.  No, that--yes, that was the reception of my dear friends' children after they were married there.  In the chair is my husband, Mr. Haymon Passmore.  Of course, that's myself leaning over him.  And that's Daniel Ng, N-G.  I don't know his bride's name, but this is Effie Shirley, former neighbor of ours in Chicago.  His parents, the Ng, NG's family, lived next door to me and stayed in a very mixed neighborhood.  We owned the building that they lived in, and for many years we were good, dear friends.  And his father later on moved back to Hong Kong and owned seventy-some McDonald's in Hong Kong.  I don't if that makes any sense in there, but just, just a mixture of people that you know.
Speaker 2: This was on a tour to South Africa with the National African Women's Congress.  And that's in the city of Venda, where they do all the beading.  And we brought back many of the things from there.  And that's in their traditional costumes, just a group of women who were selling wares, the Venda, South Africa.
Story_ID: 56475
Speaker 1: Looks like I loved that dress didn't it?  That's C. Payne Lucas, president of Africare, who had a program here.  I was the president of the chapter of Africare in Chicago [Illinois].  That picture was taken at the Museum of Science and Industry at a presentation that we made on what was happening and where the funds that we raised were being spent for the African project, for the Africare project.
Speaker 2: Okay, great.  How does Mr. Lucas spell his first and last name?
Speaker 1: L-U-C-A-S, Lucas.
Speaker 2: And Payne is spelled?
Speaker 1: P-A-Y-N-E.
Speaker 2: Okay, I'm traveling again.  That was in Spain at one of their palaces.  And I just thought that the decoration of the mosaic tiles were interesting so I stopped for a picture there.  That was in Spain in 1990--I think that's '97 [1997].
Speaker 1: Ninety-eight [1998].
Speaker 2: Ninety-eight [1998], okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: This is myself, and we were actually in Kankakee, Illinois, where my family had a home on the lake.  And I was in charge of my cousin's kids who I loved dearly and who I took on many short vacations with me.  They're all grown now of course.  The one on the left is Shelton Bowski (ph.); the one in the center is a girl, that's Selena Bowski; and the one to my right is Elliot McCoy, Elliot McCoy.  And you can see from the vintage of the cars that at that time people kept their cars a long time didn't they?  So that was a Buick; as you see the three holes there that was a Buick, and I don't know the year.  And I think we're sitting on a Chevrolet.  I'm not sure.  But that was in Kankakee, Illinois, at our family's retreat.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay, that's in South Africa at the embassy in South Africa.  We had just came into--
Speaker 1: This was '93 [1993], right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And what was the, what was the occasion--
Speaker 2: Reception.

Speaker 1: Okay, and was this as a vacation trip or were you there on business or?
Speaker 2: I was there with the women, same thing.  These are same thing, National Council of African Women.  Yeah, and that was one of the ladies who was president of one of the groups in South Africa who met us on that trip.
Speaker 1: Well, this is at an annual birthday celebration that my husband [Haymon Passmore] and I give, and we donate all of our--we ask people not to bring gifts but to make donations to charitable organizations that we are associated with.  So this was--I think that was my--it was sixty-ninth birthday.  I think I was sixty-nine at that time.  Yes, we did not celebrate our anniversary then, but we were just celebrating our birthdays--birthday party.
Speaker 2: Oh, this is in our living room.  And we had for a guest, she's from South Africa.  And after having gone and visit, then she came to visit us for a few days.  Her name is Ramosa (ph.).  Ooh, she was married to a, an attorney.  What is her first name?--Alacan (ph.) Ramosa.  I can get you the spelling of the name of that, but I don't know it right now.  I can get that for you.  So that was about 1998.  That was 1998.
Speaker 1: There I go with that dress again (laughter).  Okay, while I was in visiting South Africa I was able to get Maria [sic, Miriam] Makeba to come to the ETA Theater and perform for us for a fundraiser.  So I was chairman of that event and she was the star of the show, Maria [sic, Miriam] Makeba from South Africa.
Speaker 2: Okay, can you spell her name?
Speaker 1: No way.  I can get all these spellings for you though, but I don't know right now.  And you see I'm wearing some of the--
Speaker 2: I've heard of a Miriam.
Speaker 1: That's her, that's it.  You said it right.  I was wearing some of the South African beads that I had bought there from the vendor.

Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Look at those spots--spats and stuff.  He was sharp as he wanted to be.  Just say a gentleman of the, of the sporting age and whatever, a sporty gentleman and whatever else of the times, okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: That's myself, Maya Angelou [HM], and again, TC Hooks [Theresa Fambro Hooks], the newspaper columnist.  And that was--I don't know where we were then, I guess another reception.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's myself again in an attempt to become a photographer's model.  I was about seventeen--
Speaker 1: Let's start over please.
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is me right out of high school, attempting to get into the world of glamour and becoming a model.  The other one was me, that believe it or not, standing as a grammar school from Carter Grammar School.
Speaker 1: The one just to the right of it?
Speaker 2: Right, with the diploma in my hand.  And of course, giving honor to my mother was on that page.  And the next one is me speaking--
Speaker 1: Hold on, hold on, you're getting ahead of me.  Give me one second.
Speaker 2: My mother, Abia Jenkins.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you give us the spelling?
Speaker 2: A-B-I-A, J-E-N-K-I-N-S.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what year do you suppose that was taken--
Speaker 2: Oh, God.
Speaker 1: --if you can remember--
Speaker 2: I had so many pictures of my--
Speaker 1: --or give us a rough idea?
Speaker 2: I'd say that's 19--early '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, that's myself and that's in Atlanta, Georgia, speaking with the media women.  Sitting behind me (unclear) is Pauline Morgan White.  You can barely see her.  I'd like for her name to be mentioned, Pauline Morgan White, who was the person who brought me there.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Check it out and see what year it was.  That was, that was just 19--2000; that's 2000, 2000.  ETA, the theater that I've been on the board on where awarded me the Milton Davis [HM] Award.  What else you wanna know about it?  Is that enough?  Very--I'm very proud of that award.  I work hard with that organization and seeing it come up like it has from selling the bricks as we tore down the old building--
Speaker 2: --with Carol Moseley Braun [HM], who became the first black woman senator out of Illinois.  She was a--well, she's a senator.  That's myself, that's Carol, and that's the full complement of the women, who, at that time, were senators from various state; that's all of 'em.  They all came out for a reception that she had here in Chicago, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Okay, when was, when was that taken do you think?
Speaker 2: That was 1997 or 1998.
Speaker 1: This is the famous Charlie Hayes, the labor leader with the automobile union.  And that was made, again, another reception for him before his death and Charlie Hayes Drive.  And a (unclear) in Chicago has been named after him where the old packing house is.  So that's Charlie Hayes, the congressman.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Oh, I love that little picture.  That was me when I was two and a half years old.  And I just think that's so precious--made in Chicago by, again, a famous photographer.  A famous black photographer made that picture, the Pattons.  So you see my mother kept me before the camera?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That's a typical outfit for-- I was born in 1926, so that was about '28 [1928] or '29 [1929], 1929.
Speaker 2: That's about 1990, and that's my mother, Abia, A-B-I-A, Jenkins; my stepfather, Percy, P-E-R-C-Y, Jenkins, J-E-N-K-I-N-S; and of course, that's me and a family portrait.
