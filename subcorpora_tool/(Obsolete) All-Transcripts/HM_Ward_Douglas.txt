Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Neculai Burghelea. Observing is [HistoryMaker] Mr. Paul Brock.  Sir, could you please state your name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My name is [HistoryMaker] Douglas Turner Ward, D-O-U-G-L-A-S, separate word, T-U-R-N-E-R, separate word, W-A-R-D--
Speaker 1: Now is that your full name?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Douglas Turner Ward.
Speaker 1: Your full given name?
Speaker 2: I gave it, I gave part of it to myself (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, can you explain every--
Speaker 2: Well, my, my, my legal name was Roosevelt Ward, Jr., and I was, you know, a junior.  My father was Roosevelt Ward [Sr.].  And I had an early career in my youth, which established me, established Roosevelt Ward in the political sector.  And when I decided to enter the artistic realm, I wanted to distinguish, not to get away from Roosevelt Ward, but Roosevelt, but I wanted to make a, distinguish between my, my early  infamy as, as, as a political activist and my entering into the, the theater.  I wanted, you know, the free theater to be a fresh beginning, not avoiding my, my past and polit- political activity, but I just wanted, wanted nobody to, to get, get confused and, and judge the two things together.  So I then decided to name myself Douglas Turner.  Of course, if you think about it, you come to the conclusion of who I chose.  And that was--
Speaker 1: And sorry, it's a name that when, when you, you see it, I mean, you know, especially back in the late '60s [1960s], you got a sense of pride, though you hadn't--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --decoded it yet.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But now, to sit here now, Douglass, Frederick Douglass--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Turner, Nat Turner--
Speaker 2: Abso, right.  It was the--
Speaker 1: --Douglas Turner.
Speaker 2: --combination of, of the two radicals who I respected greatly in terms of, of our historical past.  Frederick Douglass, of course, representing the, the conscious intellectual but militant, you know, radical and leader, and of course, (laughter) Nat Turner, that, that, that apoplectic (laughter) sort of revolutionary who decided to (laughter), to, to lift and raise arms against his oppressors, you know.
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.  So, well, that, that's something.  I, I thought about that at one point, but I never, you know, but I'm glad the, you know, hear--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and of course--
Speaker 1: --hear--
Speaker 2: --Ward is still my give, my, you know, given name.
Speaker 1: And for the record, you're not related to [HistoryMaker] Val Gray Ward, right (laughter)?
Speaker 2: No, no, Val and I are not related.  I've always respected Val, and, and you know, we've had, (laughter) you know, pleasant times when we met and talked and, and so forth.  But I don't think we're related, even though coming from Mound Bayou [Mississippi], my father, the Wards are not too far away because my father come from, I think, around St. Francisville in, in, in, in Louisiana, which is not too far from the Mississippi border.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Burnside, Louisiana, May 5th, 1930.  And as an actor, u- usually I wouldn't (laughter), I wouldn't announce, I wouldn't announce the date because, you know, actors are always, say wait a minute, wait a minute, I don't, I, I'm not, I'm not, I'm, I'm not gon' name, I'm not gon' date myself because I may go look for a job (laughter), and I don't want 'em to figure out how old I am by how, by (unclear) how old the parties.  You know, but anyway, that's, that's my real, my date.
Speaker 1: Okay, we're, we're, we're gonna archive this until your career is over (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right (laughter), that's what I, I figured.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, and, and sir, what is your, is, you know, this is a, a standard beginning, so what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm a playwright, actor, director, and of course, with my leadership of the Negro Ensemble Company, I was a producer.  And you know, I function as (laughter) essayist and et cetera.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And writing no, in, in every form of writing except I would say I, I, I'm not a, a formal poet, even though I've been, as a playwright, the great late black critic, Larry Neal, gave me the greatest compliment in terms of talking about critical reception in my work by saying that I proved that I was not just a excellent dramatist but a brilliant (laughter) po- poet, you know, through my writing, particularly he was basically reviewing the, the, the play, 'The Reckoning,' you know, my play, 'The Reckoning,' which still nobody wants to deal with (laughter), you know, because you know, the content and, and the style of it in many ways.
Speaker 1: And we, so we make sure we, we, we can hit it in the right chronological order, when was 'The Reckoning' written?
Speaker 2: 'The Reckoning' was, was, was the, right, the third play that I wrote.  I think it may have been produced after 'Brotherhood,' which, which, but, but it was either third or fourth of my, my early works.
Speaker 1: So that'd been--
Speaker 2: And it was produced--
Speaker 1: --in, in the early '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: --it was produced in New York [New York] in, in the mid-'70s [sic. 1969].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  All right, now, and what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date, today is June 10th, yes.
Speaker 1: Two thousand--
Speaker 2: Two thousand five [2005].
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: In New York City [New York, New York] I think at some building (laughter) (unclear)--
Speaker 1: A teachers college.
Speaker 2: --teachers college, right.  Columbia Teachers College [Teachers College, Columbia University, New York, New York], right.
Speaker 1: Okay, we ask these questions.  This is--
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: --an oral history, so we have to--
Speaker 2: Right, right, oh, I--
Speaker 1: --ask you these kind of questions.
Speaker 2: --I, I, I get (unclear).
Speaker 1: But, and I, I may ask you for a date or how to spell something as we go along.
Story_ID: 276505
Speaker 1: But before we go, go into depth, there are five lightweight kind of warm-up questions that we always ask everybody, and they, they only require a short answer.  The first one is, sir, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Favorite food, red beans and rice and gumbo (laughter).
Speaker 1: A true son of Louisiana.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I would say, I probably be prone to red, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Not really.  When you grow up in Louisiana, (laughter) you adjust to whatever the seasons are, you know.
Speaker 1: All right, do, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: New Orleans [Louisiana].  I live in, in, in New York [New York], but I used New Orleans as my, my home away from home, and--
Speaker 1: Kind of a retreat?
Speaker 2: Yes, retreat.  And, but for many years, I also, as my children grew up, I also spent about thirteen years on Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts] during the summer, both as a vacation but also gave me a chance to, to do my own writing when I was running the, the theater [Negro Ensemble Company (NEC)] for nine months of the year.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the last one is, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Not really, but I'm, I'm, I'm prone, most of the people who will talk about me will (laughter) will, will probably mention the fact that MF probably is one of (laughter) my, my, my most favorite utterance, utterances (laughter), you know--
Story_ID: 276506
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Roosevelt Ward, Sr.] side.  We'll cover both of them, but we'll start with your mother's side of the family.  Can, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is, is Dorothy Short, which was her maiden name, and Ward, W-A-R-D when she married my father.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My, my mother's date of birth would be nineteen--I think maybe 1909, if, if, if, if you--I know she died when she was sixty-three or four in 1973, so you can count back from there and, and get, I think it's about nine.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, and where was she born?
Speaker 2: Burnside, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now, what can you tell us about the ancestors on your mother's side of the family?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, if, if I start that, you, you, you, you, you're gonna have to have a whole new session (laughter) to deal with it 'cause it's one of those--I hate to say it--it's one of those Strom Thurmond sort of histories and, and will eventually, hopefully, be, be, be dealt with in, in television or, or at least a, in some, some book form.  I am, my mother and, and I then, we are the descendants of the worst cracker (laughter) who ever lived in, in, during the Civil War period, General Nathan Bedford Forrest, the founder of the Ku Klux Klan [KKK], is (laughter) one, one--
Speaker 1: You're right.
Speaker 2: --one of--
Speaker 1: That's the worst.  That's--
Speaker 2: --one of--that's right--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --one of my, one, one of my ancestors on my mother's side.  And that's, that's a story--
Speaker 1: So he actually is--
Speaker 2: --in itself.
Speaker 1: --he's a blood relative on that side--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he, he was a slave owner.  It was basically, that's, that, that old story about, you know, the slave own, the slave owner owned my great-great-great-grandmother [sic. great-great-grandmother], Elnora.  And he was going to sell her and keep the, the baby that she had birthed for him, his daughter, and, and keep her and sell the mother, and she ran away.  And it was the onset of Civil War, so she was able to escape down the Mississippi River and from somewhere in, in, in 'round the Memphis or Tennessee area.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Pulaski, Tennessee, was his--
Speaker 2: Right, with Pulaski--
Speaker 1: --yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --is of course is where, where he founded the, the Klan.  But he was a slave, slave trader.  I mean wasn't all, he, he, his genius and reputation comes from the fact that he was, he was the southern general who, who, you know, guerrilla warfare against the North, and he--
Speaker 1: He wreaked--
Speaker 2: --was successful.
Speaker 1: --havoc on the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, absolutely.  He was probably the most successful of the southern generals because of his mastery of, of, of horse, you know, mounted horse warfare.  And so he gave the--but the reason why I mentioned it is that this whole idea of the gentleman South--no, he was a, you know, cracker from the, the, the woods.  I mean, you know, he was so that it's not like talking about some gentleman.  It wouldn't matter to me whether he was a gentleman or not, but the thing about it is that he made his fortune being a slave trader, and therefore he owned slaves.  And as I always say when, when everybody question us about this white part of us, I say wait a minute.  I say it's commonsense, these slave owners like, you own women.  What do you think (laughter), what do you think they did with the women?  All these are beautiful women and so forth that they own.  You think that just, their morals or ethics kept them from not touching 'em?  It's full of, you know, we know.  So anyway, it's not a, it's just a fact, I mean different from, from, from this lady Strom Thurmond, who I, you know, that whole nonsense she talks.  My family was not proud of this, you know, was not proud of the fact that, but it's a fact.  I mean, you know, my great-great-grandmother had no, no choice.  But the interesting thing about it in, in tracking it down, ironically, my great-grandmother, Dicie Adeline Forrest, married under his last name, which shocked me when I saw the marriage certificate in, in Donaldsonville courthouse in Louisiana.  And she married under her (laughter) name, her name, Dicie Adeline Forrest.  So, so it was (laughter) was on, it's on record, so the oral, you know, the oral stories suddenly, I mean only, only three or four years ago, I, I was shocked to see that, that, that the, you know, the, it's on record that she'd married under, under that, that name.  But it was always known in, in the family that, the story that I told you earlier.  Anyway, I only mention that, of course, that's just the most sensational part of the heritage.
Story_ID: 276507
Speaker 1: It's inescapable because on my mother's [Dorothy Short Ward] side, both Dicie Adeline Forrest, who married Isaac Short, Isaac Short himself, her husband, the two of 'em was also the, the, the son of some, some white dude.  I think just recently I, I remembered my, my aunt telling me I think some engineer, a build, bridge builder in Louisiana, I think his name was Crowder [ph.], I just think I found out, but for some reason, different from his wife, he refused to even use the name of his blood father, the, the slaveo- who owned him, and basically changed his name and named himself Short.  So my mother's name and, and our ancestry, Short, is not a (laughter), is not directly, I mean Isaac Short naming himself Short, you know.  And we didn't find that out until much later, saying wait a minute.  We're not--you know, he, he named himself Short.
Speaker 2: That, that's, this is interesting.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what I'm saying, it's all (laughter), it's almost a whole story in itself.
Speaker 2: Now are there any, any stories or good stories that come out of all this--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, it's a whole thing.  I mean like, for instance, Isaac Short, all of this, of course, pile, dovetail around the Civil War period, I mean both, both of 'em.  I think Isaac Short may, may have been about four, four years older than Dicie.  So when they married, the marriage certificate showed that she was about 16 or 17, and he was about 20, 23, 24.  And he then became some sort of minor official in the Reconstruction government era in, in Louisiana in, in the same area we all came from, Burnside [Louisiana].  But he was ran out of, with the reaction taking place with, after the, the, the defeat of Reconstruction and, and the southerners coming back into power, they ran him out of the rural area that he, he, he, he resided in, Burnside, and he took his, the whole family, by this time a quite large family.  I think my, my grandfather [Joseph Short] was about five years old when, when, when this happened.  And so they ran him away, and he, he wound up in, in, in New Orleans [Louisiana].  But my grandfather, one of his sons, loved, you know, the, the, the life of, of, of the rural area, particularly farming and growing things so much that he ran away and went, ran back also because I think as (laughter), as they say, he ran back because of my grandmother, who he eventually married.  And so that wing of my family grew up to, we were the peasants.  I mean we were the peasant branch.  But the other larger group of the people went, wound up with, with, with their father, my Isaac, in, in, in New Orleans, and, and they became the, the city people because Isaac eventually became a, worked for the Pullman Company and, and went up the ladder as high as a black person could, could, could get in the Pullman Company, although Isaac pretty much (laughter) looked like a white man.  As my buddies in Louisiana always did tell me is that they didn't know.  They used to wonder why that, why that old white man was living with these colored people, talking about my cousins.  You know, 'cause he, he lived till he was almost a hundred and in fact, partly responsible for my, my, my, my odyssey and my fate.  In terms of that, I was precocious in reading, and I used to get all, most of my material from him, you know, magazines and stuff and so forth when I was a child.  I'd go visit him and you know.  And, but, anyway, it's quite, quite remarkable story.  So on both sides, my mother's side, the, the story with, with both of these, you know (laughter), the grand, the grand, grand, the grandfather, great-great-grandfather and the gra- grandmother both be the, the products of, of, of, of white slave masters.  And as, you know, the, the, the, the, my, my, on my grandmother's side, I don't know quite as much in detail because the, the, the whole thing of Nathan Bedford Forrest made me re- research it (laughter) (unclear) find fine grain research with it, my, my grandmother.  I wasn't able to, to concentrate as much on that because it was a little more vaguer.
Story_ID: 276508
Speaker 1: How old were you when you, when you discovered that, who Nathan Bedford Forrest (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --was and, and who he really was?
Speaker 2: That's a story in itself, and being a writer, of course, it's a wonderful story.  My grandfather died, Joseph Short, you know, the one I said ran back and remained the, the, the peasant branch.  Joseph Short died when I was about eight or nine years old.  By this time, I'm, I'm living in, in, in New Orleans [Louisiana] with my father and mother, Roosevelt Ward [Sr.] and, and Dorothy [Short] Ward.  And we're living in this, this, this, you know, this, this house in, in, in, in, in New Orleans, uptown on Upperline Street.  When he died, so when his family collected, all of my uncles collected and came to, to, to our house where we lived, they all collected in, in, in a room that I was in.  I think I was ill with the flu or something.  But they wound up gathering in, in the same room that I was in.  And, and, and some reporter from a black paper came to get an obituary.  And all of a sudden, this aunt of mine, sister of my grandfather, who had, who had just died, she suddenly spoke up and says well, who we were and, and so, and she says and, and, and then we, we're the descendants of General Nathan Bedford Forrest.  Well, at eight or nine years old, it wasn't, you know, I, I had no information and, and, and so forth to connect anything except the general part.  Living in, in the segregated South, even at eight or nine, I was aware of generals, (laughter) black people don't have no generals.  I mean where the generals come from?  So that was the thing that, that, that, that struck my ear.  But when she said it, what happened is her, her, her two brothers, my uncle Martin and Ulysses [ph.], by my, my grandfather's younger brothers who were there in the room, the stormed out, I mean furious.  So the combination of this general (laughter), the curiosity of a nine-year-old saying black, black kid saying where, where, where the general come from, and the fact that my uncles reacted so fiercely and angrily to her statement sort of stuck with me.  Now, as I grew up, and as I said, I'm very precocious.  I mean I was very preco- I mean I read everything, so by the time I'm eleven years old, I'm entering high school [Xavier University Preparatory School], in New Orleans [Louisiana].  I'm also reading not (laughter), not children's book.  I'm reading Richard Wright's 'Black Boy' or whatever, whenever that came out.  You know, I'm, I'm buying, I'm saving all my money to buy books, adult books, so my curiosity was wetted.  And as time and as I grew up, gradually it came into focus who General Nathan Bedford Forrest was, of course.  And then I was as angry as my, my uncles were at the fact that, that, this, this information about, about it.  And I was also then angry at my aunt for, 'cause when she said it she sound like she was proud.  I remember her being proud of it.  Anyway, as the time went along, you know, like all of us have these odd people (laughter) I my family, my aunt was the odd one, you know, so.  And, and, but it was just, you know, how her, her brother's attitude was, was mine.  I mean we were angry about it, but she, for some reason, you know, that thing, proud of being (laughter) descendants of white MF, as I would put it.  But I began to put two and two together and eventually, as I got older, began to ask and draw it out of my, my, my uncles and aunts and so forth, almost pulling teeth, because nobody wanted to talk about, (laughter) you know, so I really had to kind of pull it out of 'em.  And I gradually began to put the details together, and the it became a mission for me to really find out not just how it happened, who, you know, who, who, what had happened, how did, you know, how did it happen, the, the people who left, you know, Bedford Forrest's slave, the, the woman, Ellen, El, Elnora [Ward's maternal great-great-grandmother], how, ha, where did she leave?  What route could you take?  'Cause she was in Tennessee.  How did she get down to Burnside, Louisiana?  Now, of course, Burnside is right on the Mississippi River.  In fact, when you, I'm sure in your interviews somebody from Louisiana would mention, you know, the plantation houses, the Houmas House [Burnside, Louisiana], the, the main one that they talk.  Well, Burnside right there.  You, you know, you walk two blocks almost, and you cross the railroad tracks, and right there at the juncture of the levy and the Houmas House, so that's where, where it is.  How did they get there, and all, how did my folks get, you know, get to that, that area?  So it became a mission of me to track it down and, and eventually, gradually I began to put the details together.
Story_ID: 276509
Speaker 1: The final thing (laughter) I've discovered in the record book, in the marriage records of, in Donaldsonville [Louisiana], the county records for Ascension Parish [Louisiana], there it is.  I mean Isaac Short [Ward's maternal great-grandfather] marries Dicie Adeline Forrest, and then had the age and so forth when they married.  Then the census, later I checked the census later for 1890, the time when, when the last time that the census mentioned his being in this ascension parish, Isaac.  And by that time he has five or six children including my grandfather [Joseph Short] who was about, 'bout four or five years old at that time.  And then after that, the, the, the census for the 1900 don't, don't mention them anymore, I mean this family.  So, by that time, in that period, between '90 [1890] and, and, and, and, and nine, 1900, is the time when I say the, the, the, the, the, the [Ku Klux] Klan [KKK]--.  Now, know Louisi- Louisiana, you got remember, Louisiana being southern--Louisiana being Catholic, the Klan couldn't take root there as the Ka- the Klan, so it was the Knights of the White Camellias, another Klan-type, a terrorist organization.  They were the ones who, who basically took over and, and, and restored the, the Confederates back into power in that lo- they were the ones who, who drove my, my great-grandfather away with his family.  So that was, you know, that, that, that was how I began to put all of these, these details and facts, you know, together.  And as I, as I said, it's nothing, you know, it's nothing to be ashamed of, noth- and black people have no, no, no reason to be shame.  I was (laughter) say if we all, we all check into this whole idea of the black--I said wait a minute.  This whole idea if you--all you gotta do is walk down the street and look at black people you'll see us (laughter) somewhere.  How did we get this, this awesome mixture of colors?  I mean it didn't come (laughter) from, it didn't come that way from, from, from Africa.  And, and we know how it happened, and that's why it's just the fact that most white people don't want to accept the fact that [President Thomas] Jefferson and all these, all these, their, their heroes did what they did.  And as I said earlier, it, it's common sense.  Thomas Jefferson, I mean Thomas Jefferson owned Sally Hemings.  I mean what do you think he's gon' do with her?  You know, sixteen-year-old pretty (laughter), he's gonna, hey, he's gonna bed her.  I mean and that's, that's, that's more common sense than people wondering whether their, their religion and their ethics and so forth prevented that.  They, they had no ethics and religion prohibition when it came to slavery.  You know, you had the--
Speaker 2: They, or they wouldn't be in it, right.
Speaker 1: --right to life and death.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: To be a slave is you owned a slave.  You have a right to throw 'em off the cliff, and nobody's gonna do anything to you.  So, I mean, to sleep with 'em is, is small potatoes almost, you know.
Story_ID: 276510
Speaker 1: That was, the, the passion of, of histori- finding out the historical fact in the background.  The, my grandmother, and when I say that it is hard to track down, it wasn't so much that it was vaguer; it's just that it was more complicated.  And my grandmother turned out that my grandmother really wasn't even the daughter of the family that was, she was listed under when she was a, a, a child in the, in, in the, in the, in, in the census era.  She came from the same area in Burnside [Louisiana], but she was about two years old.  But, ironically, the census named her under the family of, of James.  But when it got to her, and she was about a bay- baby of two years old, then it was Brooks.  So we've come to the conclusion that her mother must have married James after she, you know, already existed as, and, and, and, and therefore she was a Brook.  So, out in that rural area, I mean with all of those, those, those, those cross-currents across (laughter), you know, marriages and, and, and liaisons and so forth, (laughter) it, it was a little more complicated to find out, you know, the, the, the, the details of, of her.  But, but basically, on her side, I found no, no, you know, no, no, no sort of sensational sort of background in, in terms of these, you know, these white folks (laughter).  I mean it seems like they were, they were more authentically, you know, black in the sense of, in their, in their, in their, their lineage and heritage.
Speaker 2: Now, did your mother [Dorothy Short Ward] talk about growing up and what it was like growing up to you at all?
Speaker 1: Not, not, you know, not really, not until, not until you, you, I was old enough to ask questions.  You know, people, people, particularly people out of a--well, I used the term peasant (laughter) out of the rural background, they don't, you know, they don't voluntarily be talking too much about the past to a certain ex- until you ask.  And eventually, thankfully, eventually, as I said, when I, when I got curi- my curiosity caused me, and I got old enough to ask.  But it was my father [Roosevelt Ward, Sr.] who eventually was the fount of information about everything in, in, in relation to, to my mother and mother, mother's family, his family, and everything else.  'Cause he, as I said, he lived un- into the 19, 9, 1997, and he was ninety-one years old, and he was lucid pretty much until he, you know, died.  In fact, he died on a Sunday when he was preparing to go to church.  And you know, he still was driving; (laughter) he always had a car.  He was still very lucid and, and in, in, in the last ten years or so of his life, I made sure (laughter) I, I ask him every question I could to get an oral, you know, history of, of his family and my mother's family and their relationship and, and, and everything that, that occurred and went on in that, in that rural area before they, you know, migrated to the city [New Orleans, Louisiana].
Story_ID: 276511
Speaker 1: So your mother [Dorothy Short Ward] went to--did, did she go to school in Burnside [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: She went--no, basically, she, she went to school in New Orleans [Louisiana].  What happened is, with, as I said, my grandfather [Joseph Short] having, having moved to, to, to New Orleans and, and, and, and so forth when she was young with her aunts and, and, and uncles and so forth, they sent, my grandfather would send her to, to New Orleans for her primary education.  So, most of her education took place in, in, in, in, you know, in, in New Orleans; then she would come back home, you know.  And, and there wasn't much access to too much education out, out in the country.  I mean, in fact, it turned out that, as it turned out is that one of my, my aunt, one of my, my, my grandfather's older sisters was one of the main teachers out in that area.  But when you say main teachers, I mean you're talking about maybe three months, three or four months a year when, when somebody was, was teaching everybody in, in a one-room school, schoolhouse for the length of time that, that they could spare away from their using them in the fields and so forth.
Speaker 1: What was the main crop out there?
Speaker 2: Sugar and, and rice, sugar cane during the winter and rice, you know, I guess during the, whatever the season, summer or whatever.  Those were the, the, the main crops.  And, and my mother, all of my, my mother in particular and my, my father's mother apparently were great cane cutters (laughter) (unclear) you know, better than my father [Roosevelt Ward, Sr.], as he always (laughter) said. They carried him (laughter), you know.  They'd be, you know, two, two furrows ahead of him while (laughter) he's lagging behind.  As they said, they had to carry him because he hated that work, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, working is supposed to be really labor intensive and--
Speaker 2: Oh and--
Speaker 1: --horrible.
Speaker 2: --oh, oh no.  I remember the, them taking me as a baby and you know, to, to the rice field, where they were doing the rice, and man, it was hot all, they said all as a baby all I said is hot, hot.  They had to find a tree, put me under or something, 'cause I couldn't stand it.  And, and also, you know, it was in that rice and with, with blue runners and snakes and stuff in that rice paddy.  Man, I couldn't--that and the cane, of course, was, would cut you to pieces, the, the, just like knives, you know, in terms of--I understood why my father said he couldn't stand that, that work and was just waiting for a chance to get out, get, get from out there, as he put it.

Speaker 1: Tell me about your father.  What, what, can, can you give us his full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's full name is, is Roosevelt Ward [Sr.], W-A-R-D.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He, he was nine, nineteen what?  He died in '70 [1970].  It was, it was 1906 I think.
Speaker 1: Okay, and was, was he born in Burnside [Louisiana] as well?
Speaker 2: No, he was born, I think he was born in, in, around St. Francisville [Louisiana].  But his mother [Virginia Edmond Ward] and father [James Ward] moved to Burnside when he, you know, when he was very young.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause basically his memory is, is, is growing up in Burnside and going back to St. Francisville area to, to visit his grandparents.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and the, that area is where the Wards, and, and once again, it's one (laughter), it's one of those complicated, I mean God--
Speaker 1: Well, well, we got to ask about this one.  Now, what, what do you know about the ancestors on the Ward side?
Speaker 2: Oh, his grandparents, they gave me detailed history of both his, his grandparents, and even though it still remain a mystery, that his grandfather, he thinks, he know he was not from Louisiana, and he always suspected that he came from somewhere.  He always said like, somewhere maybe around as far away as, as Baltimore [Maryland] he always said.  But I don't (laughter) (unclear) peculiar how, how you would get there from that area, but he knew that he wasn't from there.  And his wife, my, my, my, my great-grandmother and his grandmother was legendary in the area because apparently they had a, they had a, almost like a, a, a tenant farm situation that left them raising crops and so forth but isolated in a, in an isolated way that, that left them independent.  I mean long, you know, long as they, they, whatever they were doing in terms of their tenant farming, they were left alone.  So it's almost like their own space, and, and, and they didn't have to be bothered too much with the white folks because they were, you know--long as they live up, I guess, to whatever the, the deal was, they, they were left alone wherever they were.  And he always remembered 'cause he hated to go there because it was so isolated in, in, in the, in, in the, in the woods, to a certain extent, that he, he said at night, you know, the darkness and so forth was frightening and everything else.  But his grandmother apparently was almost more Indian [Native American] than even, even pure, you know, even, even African heritage.  And, and she was known in the area for being a root woman.  Everybody in the area came to her for their ills and, and, and so forth for her to, you know, give 'em the roots and cure the particular ailments that they had, I mean except, you know, if somebody with a broken bone or something, but any ail, all of the things that could be affected by knowledge of roots.  And apparently she was, she was very, very, was, was an expert in that area.  I never could get out of it, and I'm still, still, still proceeding to try to research it: what particular Indian tribe or so that she might have came from.  But his always remember, memory of it was that she was, you know, she, she, she, she was, had to be an Indian, you know, not full-blooded because she was a mixture.  But it still intrigues me in terms of finding out what tribe--
Story_ID: 276513
Speaker 1: --Now Louisiana has a whole set of, you know, histories of Indian [Native American] tribes in that, in the area, both in the north and also, particularly in, in the southern area.  In fact, it, it, Louisiana one of, is one of the interesting states in the fence--in the sense that slaves, slaves could escape and make alliances and, and, and become of the, the Indian tribes.  And, and in some instance, particularly in the south in the bayou, if they could, they held out.  They set up their own little, little, you know, little, little communities, and, and you know, the French at that time couldn't, couldn't deal with them.  And the French didn't, you know, French were different from quote the later American.  French didn't, weren't gonna pursue 'em that, that strong anyway (laughter), like, let 'em stay there in the fra- you know, French weren't, weren't that interested (laughter) in being, you know, being, being strict about things.  They were, in fact, most of the French people in Louisiana, that origin there, they've, you know, they were, they came from France, dumped from France by (laughter), if they were, you know, were, were, were, were the, the dissolute types and the, the, the people who they made governors because they couldn't do right in France.  They sent 'em to Louisiana.  And they came there and all they wanted to do was (laughter), was lazy, the, you know, to take the easiest route out, so they weren't as, as officious about things in relation to the, you know, the slaves there.  And you got to remember, Louisiana was, was under French and then forty years of Spanish control but still basically French tute- you know, tutelage until it was sold--
Speaker 2: Now, now does that--
Speaker 1: --eighteen o'three [1803], when, when, when, when Toussaint [L'Ouverture] made Napoleon [Bonaparte] (laughter), Toussaint made Napoleon give up his ambition in the Northern Hemisphere.  And Napol- you know, and Napoleon decided, well, shit that, that it's, it's, after Toussaint beat him, that he'd better go, go, go to Egypt and gave up, and then decided, you know, that, that it was too expensive to try to keep, you know, continue in his ambition in, in, in, in this continent and therefore sold it--
Speaker 2: Yeah, now is, is--
Speaker 1: --Louisiana.
Speaker 2: --the Indian connection, does that, does that inform, you know, when you see the Mardi Gras, you see all the, all these black people dressed in these elaborate Indian--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it has, it had, it, it, it, yeah, it has, it has, it had roots there.
Speaker 2: Wild Tchoupitoulas and all (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes, it has great roots in, in terms of it.  I've always, when I grew up, of course, I wasn't aware of the historical aspect of it.  I wasn't aware that it was--and part of it is true, but I found out later that it, it goes deeper than that.
Story_ID: 276514
Speaker 1: Part of it for my generation was an alternative to the Zulus.  You know, the Indians [Native Americans], you know, suddenly for us teenagers and growing up, I mean we, we embraced the Indian Mardi Gras celebration and, and so forth because we were, we, we, we, we were, we were infuriated. As, as you got older, you sort of got it and, and particularly in, in the wartime era and, and, and, and--
Speaker 2: Now what's the Zulu, kind of explain that to us in--
Speaker 1: I always feel, I feel now, and I'm, I'm not that expert on it, but I feel now that there's been a, a revisionist whole thing about the, the, the Zulus and that.  People are putting emphasis on its, almost like carnival takeoff in imitating, you know, the highfalutin thing of, of the white parades with their recs and all of the, the, you know, all of the, the, the, the so-called elegance and, and, and kingship and all of that stuff that the Zulus, Zulus sort of became a satirical takeoff on that.  That may be true, and that's, and, and, and a lot of people diffused certain negative elements of it by stressing that.  My generation, we, we, we, we became embarrassed even before we became Afrocentric about it.  There was something about--we knew that, that it was playing--you know, you know, in our, our, our culture when we say playing the fool for white people.  It took on that element, that it was playing the fool for white people and, and, and therefore the exaggeration, even though we weren't, we, we, we weren't Afrocentric about it, but we knew there was something, the stereotype.
Speaker 2: So the Zulu--
Speaker 1: The ca- yeah, the Zu--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, the stereo--
Speaker 2: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) we already were living with the story--stereotype--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --of the, you know, the white-lipped, you know, and there're all of the cartoon thing about the, the, the, the savages, you know, burning white men in oil and all of those pictures.  So, the stereo, that stereotype to us, once again, was part of that pantheon of stereotypes that had, had, you know, had, had, had really offensive, you know, that had, had, you know, debauched us and, and, and, and defamed us.  And suddenly, the Zulus became just an extension to us, my generation, of that sort of--
Speaker 2: Of a ridic- ridiculing of black people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, ridi- the ridiculing of black people for the, for, for, for the eyes and benefit of white people's, you know, racism and laughter, laughing at us.  I mean it was almost like--
Speaker 2: So it, it had nothing to do with the Zulus as such of South Africa, but more--
Speaker 1: No, because I mean like the--you know, most of the Zulus didn't--at that point, you know, of course it was nobody--even the educated people still were ignorant up to the point of thinking about Africa almost as the jungle, like what the movies said about it.  We, you know, we were not, except for, for, for those advanced people like, you know, Woodson, Carter [G.] Woodson and other people of that gener- hey, most of the people, we, we were ignorant about the real--but there was an instinctive thing that we knew that we weren't what white people claimed we were and painted.  We didn't know the facts of Africa, but we knew instinctively that that wasn't what we were, that we had--we didn't know what history we might have had and still will, will, will put, you know, put in a, in a, in a, in a, in a defensive position about it, but something told us that what white people said we, we were and what they said Africa was, was not the truth.
Story_ID: 276515
Speaker 1: And we knew the use that the images that they were using, the, the stereotypical images that they were using, and one of 'em, you know, just like with all of the Aunt Jemima, all, all of those stereotypical--that one of 'em was always about Africa in, in, in the grass skirts and the, and the, you know, and, and, and the savages who were not civilized yet.  And the Zulus sort of, it carried out, you know, and, and almost gave emphasis to that sort of stereotype for us.  And what I'm saying now is that it's been, been, been apt for blacks now in order to continue to sustain it.  And I'm sure now that it doesn't have the edge that it had during the time of segregation.  So now it's, it's still more fun and, fun and games, but hey, the Zulu parade [at Mardi Gras], maybe a new generation, maybe a younger generation can, can, can, can digest it and, and accept it.  I, I still can't, to a certain extent, just look at it as a fun part of our cultural, you know, heritage.  But the point I'm making about the Indians [Native Americans] is that for my generation, we embraced the Indians.  Now, somebody could say well, you know, you still, you know, you're still taking stereotype of the Indian.  But the Indians might have taken over certain elements of the stereotypical attitudes toward Indians--but they, they usurped it to the extent that they turned it into an original element that ceased to really be about (laughter), you know, the, the stereotypes of the Indian, I mean the, the, the, the, the costumes, for instance, of the Wild Tchoupitoulas and the Indian tribe.  That's one of the most, it's almost art.  It's almost elaborate to the point (laughter) it's like--
Speaker 2: It is art.
Speaker 1: --artistic.  The music elements, which is, which takes out elements of, of, of the great, greatest elements of our musical history.  So they, you know, they, they have, what the, the, whatever the starting point that still has some stere- stereotypical elements of the Indian thing, they took it and, and, and, and, and took it far beyond that and turned it into an original thing that was not insulting while the Zulu parade (laughter)--I don't care--with the, you know, the grass skirts and, and, and the painted faces, the black face and so forth.  That, I mean look, hey, that's not, that's not taking it beyond--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --anything.  That's, that's just being stuck--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --with the stereotype and, and, and still getting the, the, you know, the derisive sort of laughter.
Story_ID: 276516
Speaker 1: I'm trying to get back to your father [Roosevelt Ward, Sr.].  We were talking about your father.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I had to remember for a minute.  Now how did we, we (laughter)--but it's, it's a good, it's good though to talk about this.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, let's see, we--I was asking about your father's side of the family and--
Speaker 2: Yep, yep, and, and you asked about--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --his, his, his grand--
Speaker 1: Yeah, you said the Indian [Native American] grandmother's doing--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --who dealt with roots.
Speaker 2: --she, she became, right.
Speaker 1: She was a root woman, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she became the, the source in that whole area for, for black and white people would come to her for, for, you know, ointments or whatever and, and, and, and medicine and, and, and all of that.  And it's sorta interesting to me because, of course, she was a, you know, a traditional black woman to, who went, went to church every Sunday and so forth.
Speaker 1: You could do this simultaneous, and you could be the root woman and--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, she was--
Speaker 1: --and, and, and be--
Speaker 2: When I say she was Indian, but--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --she was black.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean, you know, it was like she, she was a black person.  It's like, as you know, what, what she, she--it wasn't like she, she, she, my grandfather had married her as, as, as an Indian tribal woman.  She had her background, you know, and her genetically, she, she was part of that and maybe part cultural, but she had grown up basically as a black person.  My, my--her husband still, the one from Baltimore [Maryland], still is, is a mystery to me because daddy said my father said he was, he was very quiet.  He never talked that much.  You know, I mean he, he was firm, and you know, you knew, knew what you couldn't, shouldn't do, but he was, you know, he was not, didn't, didn't, didn't really, you know, didn't talk that much.  But he intrigues me because, while his wore--while my grand- my, my father says he went to church--she went to church every Sun- he never did.  All he'd do is sit on the, sit on the gallery, (laughter) as he put it, and wait for her to come back.  So it always atrigue, intrigues me why, you know, why did they go (laughter), why didn't they go to church?  When everybody is, you know, in that area, you know, everybody was in church.  And he didn't seem like he was a rousta, you know, roustabout, you know, back in the woods playing guitar type and, and, and, and in the juke joint.  He didn't seem like he was part of that, but he also wasn't, didn't (laughter) follow through in terms of his, the practices of, of, of churchgoing, and yet his wor- why, you know, wife, dutifully did it.  Now this, this, this thing intrigues me by these, my, these great two great-grandparents, just like the, it intrigued me about my mother's [Dorothy Short Ward] grand--Isaac [Ward's maternal great-grandfather, Isaac Short] and, and, and, and, and, and his wife [Dicie Forrest Short] in- intrigued me.  Why did Isaac refuse to use his master--father's name and his wife, the one with, with, with, with Forrest, has it on her marriage certificate?  I mean it's two opposites, so, I mean the same: they went to church; one went to church, and the other didn't go to church.  They just sort of intrigued me.  And I'm still, still pursing (laughter), you know, trying to figure out their identity that, you know, from, from, from those, those sort of behaviors.  But anyway, daddy used to go visit them regularly as he grew up, but primarily, eventually his, you know, his name growing up and, and, and until he was a young man and married and so forth, was at Burnside [Louisiana], you know--
Speaker 1: Can I--
Speaker 2: --because they, his father [James Ward] and mother [Virginia Edmond Ward] wound up in Burnside because I think economic reason.  I think that, that, that, the cane and the rice or something that was an economic period where the word got around I think all over that area that there was work to be gotten down in, in, further south.  And that's why they came from St. Francisville [Louisiana], which is closer to the Mississippi border all the way down to Southern Louisiana, Burnside, which is only about fifty-five miles from, from, from New Orleans [Louisiana].
Story_ID: 276517
Speaker 1: Did he [Ward's father, Roosevelt Ward, Sr.] go to school in Burnside [Louisiana] or in New Or- New Orleans [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: He, he went to school I think--I know it wasn't New Orleans.  He, whatever, whatever education he, he got, was somewhere in that area.  I'm not, I don't think it was directly in Burn, Burn, Burnside, but it was somewhere in that area he got whatever his, his education. Neither my father or mother [Dorothy Short Ward] were educated beyond the primary grades.  I mean, like, I think my mother maybe seven, seventh, eighth, and my father similarly.  But I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't remember him talking too much about his early education.  He might have even went to school for a while up, up in St. Francisville [Louisiana], you know, or he might have--I've forgotten when exactly they, his, his father [James Ward] and mother [Virginia Edmond Ward], moved to, you know, to, to, to Burnside, per se.  But, he, it, it, his education must have come from somewhere in that area, different from my mother, who, who as I said, was, went to New Orleans.
Speaker 1: Now, but he, he became primarily a, a farmer--
Speaker 2: Yeah, no.
Speaker 1: --basically.  No?  Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He, he became a revenuer [sic.].  He became, I mean--
Speaker 1: A revenuer, okay.
Speaker 2: No, he ultimately, he made his living young.  Once he married my mother he made (laughter), he made his main living, he worked in the, he worked, as I said, a cane field in, and then, then maybe a little in the rice field, but they had to carry him.  He wasn't gonna, he wasn't that good at it, and he didn't like it, so he didn't try to do too good.  And apparently his mother was, was, was a powerful woman, who, and he was her only child, so, so she sort of, you know, gave him an umbrella of protection and, and carried him.  And in fact, he always talks about the fact he, he all, his, his generation envied him because, you know, the, the kids of his age and so forth had to do the work and so forth when he didn't have to 'cause his mother (laughter), his mother, you know, sort of protected him from, from it.  And apparently she was such a brilliant worker herself till everybody wanted her.  The problem was that she also was combative and, and difficult for the white people to deal with.  And, and as he says, he, she was so combative in, in, in, in, in so many ways that sooner or later they had to move, you know, from (laughter) one, one plantation to another plantation, a quar- one quarter to another quarters I mean, I mean in the same area, work for somebody else, because she, she'd get in trouble including one great episode where a white man tried to threaten her--and she had that cane, you know, that ma, that machete--and threatened to put his hand on her.  And before he knew it, she, she, she cut his damn (laughter), not, not his whole hand, but she damn near cut his, cut his fingers off and hit him with that machete and so forth.  And at that time, you know, white people--but she was so powerful, my father said that whoever her boss was, the people who, who tried to, after she'd cut the, the, the white foreman or whoever it was and then they came to get her or so forth, and then she called on her, her cousin or somebody else to join her against them or something like that and said the white boss told the white people, no, said, "You know better than that.  You know better than to mess with that woman.  That woman is crazy."
Story_ID: 276518
Speaker 1: Well, you were telling me what your father [Roosevelt Ward, Sr.] did. You said he was a revenuer.  What, what exactly did he do?
Speaker 2: During, during, during the Prohibition period, he made corn whiskey, you know, illegal corn whiskey and, and, and, and, and--
Speaker 1: Oh, he was the opposite of a revenuer.  He was hiding the--
Speaker 2: Not, yeah, right, right, I mean, you know--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --I, I, I got the term mixed, mixed, mixed up.  He was a bootlegger, rather.  I, I, I've forgotten the--he was a bootlegger.  And, and in fact he got away with it because he was selling it to (laughter), to all the, all the people in the, sheriff, everybody else in, in the area.  But what, the feds didn't know when they came to, to try to find out, you know, who was making the stuff.   They so focused on him so much, until they didn't realize that it was my mother [Dorothy Short Ward] who (laughter) really, really running the, the still in the, in, in the woods.  And my mother had learned it from her father [Joseph Short] 'cause he also was, was a, making, bootlegging stuff and so forth (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You can make a good living with that.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Well, he was, that, shit, he, he was making a good living.  So, actually, all that farm work, no, that, he, he, he couldn't (laughter), he put that aside.  But then he, he also wanted to not be there.  He didn't like staying there.  And, and, as I always kidded him about it, my growing up, reaching school age, gave him a perfect excuse (laughter) because finally he could, he could say, look, I, I'm, you know, this place doesn't have any, any place for my, my child to be educated, so I want my child to get an education.  And which was true, but I said that it, it was, it was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --a combination.  It was true, but it also gave him a perfect, you know, reason--
Story_ID: 276519
Speaker 1: Is there, is there a story about how your parents [Dorothy Short Ward and Roosevelt Ward, Sr.] met?  Did they tell a story about--
Speaker 2: Oh, God, my, my, my, my father told, you know, it's almost like a classic tale.  To make it simple, is that my father, because he was sort of spoiled, as I've said about his mother [Virginia Edmond Ward] to a certain extent, and living out there and being, everybody resenting him because he didn't have to do the work that, that, all the other kids of his generation, but he, he became like what, you know, a, a, a, sport, you know, ladies' man and you know (laughter) I mean, you know, the sport of the, the, the, the community [in Burnside, Louisiana].  And I think he wound up having a car at a time when nobody (laughter) else had a car and all that.  So, but my grandfather [Joseph Short], my mother's father, sort of knew about his reputation, and therefore when he, my father made eyes on my mother, 'cause he knew my mother's younger sisters and so forth, it seemed like he knew all of them and knew them and had, you know, been friendly with them and so forth, but had never seen her.  So he thought that my grandfather had kept her hidden or something (laughter) and that wasn't so.  It's my father's personality and nature was a little different from--her younger sister was out there, you know, and she, she was more reserved and, and, and reticent type.  So when he laid eyes on her, he said no, no.  I mean that, that, that, that was, he knew that was for him.  But my grandfather couldn't abide him (laughter), knew about his reputation and say the last thing in the world (laughter) that he was gon', he was gon' go out with his daughter.  You know, so, my grand- my, my grandfather did everything possible to prevent him from dating my, my, my, my, my mother.  But, my father being, being slick and smart, conspired with other relatives of my mother, like an uncle, some uncle that he knew was a friend 'cause he played ball or somethin' on the same team.  And he then got my, my uncle to, to, to sort of speak for him and, and, and notes or whatever he did in, in relation to make contact with her.  And, and, and it turned out my mother as receptive to him, but, but she was afraid, fearful of her father.  So it was, it was rocky going; you know, it was rocky going, and, and they--he said one time I mean he, he, he had a date with my, my, my mother and, and, and I think a friend or uncle, the, the same uncle that he--they went out on a joint date and went to the movies somewhere in, in, in a car.  And when they, when they got wherever they were, my mother got so frightened that she said take me home (laughter).  I think she, she, defying her father, but, but, but she thought better of it before, before it ended, so he had to take her back home (laughter) right quick 'cause she was scared of her, you know, her, her, her, her father.  And, and, but also, she, it wasn't that my, my grandfather was gon' do anything violent to--he, she, it was also that he was intimidating, and, and she respected him.  She, she loved her father so.  But anyway, my, my, my father just was persistent.  You know, I mean he was the type he was persistent, and he just, he just, just finally wore, wore my grandfather down.  And, and my mother--my grandfather was the type who finally said look, you want her (laughter) (unclear) you talking about the word, word you don't use without that.  I think my grandfather said you, you, you want to go with that (laughter), that nigger?  She said well, yes, yes, pa, you know, and so forth.  And he said all right, then I'll let you go, but I don't (laughter), I don't think you're making the right choice.  But anyway, to jump forward, before my grandfather died, my father say he finally, before he died, he told my, my father, said look, I didn't, I, I didn't want you; I, you're the last person I want with my daughter, 'cause my mother was the oldest child that--said the last thing I wanted and he--but he said before my grandfather--he, he gave him the compliment, saying you turned out to be the best son-in-law I ever had, you know.  But anyway, it was one of those, those classic love stories, and, and, and everything was put, impediment was put (laughter) in front of 'em.  But my, my father persisted.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and apparently my, you know, my mother was, was, was sympathy (laughter), you know, was sympathetic to his attentions from the start.  But, you know, grandfather finally gave away (simultaneous)--

Speaker 2: No, I don't have any, any, any blood brothers and sisters, but it's like I was the youngest grandchild from my, in the family.  I was the first grandchild in my, my mother's [Dorothy Short Ward] brothers and sisters and all of them.  And she was the oldest, and I was the first grandchild.  And actually, my, my, my grandfather [Joseph Short] died with me being the only grandchild he had.  So, what happened is my aunts and uncles, the younger aunts and uncles sort served as my surrogate brothers and sisters 'cause my, like for instance, my, my, my youngest aunt was only three years older than I am, and then the next one was five, a boy.  And so, there was a, three or four of my, my, my uncles and aunts who were close to my age, so they became--so I became almost the youngest child in an extended family--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --rather than--so I had the benefit of being an only child period because I was the only child of my mother, even though they had had a son before me, but he died.  And then after I was born I didn't have any blood relatives but my--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I was sort of like, like the, the youngest child in the--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the extended family.

Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My, I, I have a number of earliest childhood memories.  I remember almost vaguely, maybe because it was told to me, but I do remember, I, I do remember being, being rescued from, as it turned out later when they told me, I remember that, that I was rescued from, from potentially a fire that would have killed me.  And I think even the, the, the, the, the lady who wound up rescuing me, as I remember, she might have perished herself.  But I remember it's like a, you know, one of those, those, those, those, those gauze sort of things that, that people in the South, you know, keep out the mosquitoes and stuff.  And for some reason, it caught a fire while I was, you know, a child in, in, in there.  And I remember, just vaguely, something in, in, in relation to that.  And then I have, have all kinds of fragmented memories of my early years in, in, in, in, in living with my [maternal] grandfather [Joseph Short].  I remember, you know, sort of sleeping with, with his then new children who were my age.  And I, I just remember the, the fragmented memories of my relationship with my, you know, my grandparents.  My grandmother had, had, had died.  My father's [Roosevelt Ward, Sr.] mother had died I think while I was, before I was two years old, so I never knew her.  I did know my mother's [Dorothy Short Ward] mother who died when I was about four, so I have memories of, of her.  I can remember her, I mean very vividly, and visiting her 'cause I, we lived in two different quarters, plantations [in Burnside, Louisiana], with only the cane fields in between us.  And I remember, I remember, you know, the memories of, of, of the, the, you know, the, the food, (laughter) I mean the, the sugar cane, and then, and, and chewing the sugar cane, and, and the, the seasons.  I remember the, the cold of, of the winter with the (unclear) 'cause where we live in the quarters was right across the road, a ditch, ditch road.  And right on the other side was the cane fields.  So I mean when parents went to work, they, you know, most of the time they had to leave the house and, and, and go right across the road into the cane fields that were right across the street.  And I, you know, I, I remember the, the, the, the area, I mean the mystery of the riv- the, the, the, the river, the levy, which, you know, during, during the days was, was a big camels hump.  But at night it was very, very, you know, very mis- mysterious.  I mean 'cause at night I mean suddenly this, this thing, what was over the, what was behind it I mean, all kinds of (laughter), you know, from ghost to, to every, all your imagination.  I remember, you know, I remember the, the, basically positive, you know, memories of, of, of those early years.  I mean I was pretty, pretty much in, in, in the bosom of, of, as I said a big family, very loving family, and very, very, very warm.  And, and there were, there were also, you know, the, the childhood fears and so forth, but--
Story_ID: 276522
Speaker 1: Did they tell a lot of ghost stories in those days?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.  I mean, oh God, but I was shocked and surprised that, talking about my, my aunt who was like my, my, my, my daughter--my, my, my, my sister, 'cause I eventually, after my [maternal] grandfather [Joseph Short] and grandmother were both gone, my mother [Dorothy Short Ward] sort of raised her along with me.  But I remember after she--sophisticated (laughter), here in New York, many years later with her own family and children, and suddenly when she and my, her older sisters and the brother would get together.  And suddenly they'll sit down, and they'd be telling these ghost stories, you know, as real.  I mean it's not ghost stories that's stories.  These, you know, these were actual, you know, to them this was, yeah.  I remember at, at the, the gate, the gate.  You know, where the gate where you enter the quarters, I remember seeing (laughter), seeing mama or somebody--you know, mama dead of course--just as clear.  And you know, well, by the time I grew up and got sophisticated, I mean you ain't supposed to believe in that sort of stuff.  And (laughter) my, my, my youngest aunt, she be there right in the--yes, I remember.  And she started telling, and I, I didn't think--she got to be kidding.  I mean she don't believe in (laughter) that nonsense, you know, is my, my attitude.  But it was just as real.  No, no, ghost stories, that stuff was, was, was just as real palpable.  I mean it was no stories.  It, it was reality.
Speaker 1: They'd tell 'em just, they would tell us, tell it just like it, it was something that real (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, oh, absolutely, absolutely, I mean with great conviction and faith.  And I'm (laughter), you know, by this time I'm, you know, I'm the rationalist, say what the, you know.  They can't be believe--but I, but as I, you know, got more mature and also my own imagination and becoming a writer and so forth, I understood it and, and, and appreciated it and, and appreciated the authenticity of it.  And, and it, it, it has its, its, its logic (laughter), you know.  I'm, you know, I'm not a, a, a (laughter) convicted believer, but I understand its, its, its rationale, you know.  And, and its, its, its reality in how it fits into people's lives and memories and so forth and enriches them, you know, their lives.
Story_ID: 276523
Speaker 1: What were some of the other sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, as I said, the, the, the seasons, the heats, the, the heats of, of summer 'cause, you know, New Orleans [Louisiana] is very, very, very muggy, Southern Louisiana I mean, and, and, and the, the, the bayous, the sense of, as I said, just like with the levy, the sense of, of mystery, you know, in terms of the, that, that area, the bayous, going into the, the woods, as we say, in the bayous and the, what could be there in the, the, you know, the alligators and, and, and, and all of the--and then also the, the, the sensuality, the sensuousness of the world, of, of the rural world, and, and the, the, the funkiness of it, the--you know, everything in terms of our, our culture, all of it was like contained right there.  Of course, there was the church on Sunday that you, walking distance and people in there, there, there--the women in the white and finery, the men, you know, with the suits on.  But the same people, half of the time, on Sunday, but that Saturday night, the same people had been back to the juke joints and, and, and, and, and, and you know, and, and, and, and listening to the song.  Of course, I was too young to be, go to the juke joints and things, things like that, but you knew of its, its happening, 'cause you're--you know, my older uncles and so forth were involved.  But the, the, the sensuousness of this, this thing, I mean it's like right away from, you know, the whole idea of, of, of sex and so forth; I mean it's, you know, you live in the country, I mean the shit, you start off the chickens and, and everybody (laughter), the horses and everybody is doing it and then, and, and, and, and then the, the, the proximity, people's proximity, people can't escape the proximity of--no matter, no, no matter how puritanical things are, it's, you can't escape the--and, and, and the liaisons and the (unclear) the, the, all of those things.  And, and, and, and the, the, the glistening, you know, the glistening bodies and all of those, those, those, those, those elements of, of life, the food, the figs, I mean, you know, real, the real figs, which were right in, in, in, in, in, in the house we lived in, the fig, fig, fig tree right, right there that you go and these succulent figs, and, and as I said, the, the, the, the, the gumbo and the soul food and, and soul food.  And it turned out that my grandfather [Joseph Short] was, was, my mother's father was rather unique in the sense that one of his work things in that area was that he grew vegetables for, what they say the, the, the white folks, and what we were exposed to and my mother [Dorothy Short Ward], even, even in, in growing up in later 'cause even my friends used to come  by and, and some of the things that she would, she would cook, I mean (laughter) my friends in the neighborhood, they, they, they didn't--you know, what is, what is that?  I mean it's like what, what were common things to us but, you know, avocados and stuff like that, I mean like people, what, what, you know, what, you know, they call it of course an alligator pear is what you call it in the South.  And--
Speaker 1: What they call it, a alligator--
Speaker 2: Alligator pear.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and, but you talkin' about soul food, still it's southern, my, my, my, my, my mother would have, you know, roast beef with, with broccoli; I mean, you know, black folks broccoli?  What is, what is, you know all--there were various food that maybe seemed very simple to us now, but in, in, in, in, in, in our sort of--it wasn't just the collard greens, you know, and the old, you know, the whole idea of, of the leavings and so forth.  My, since my grandfather grew all this stuff for both meats and, and, and vegetables for the white folk, I mean we, we were exposed to all of the shit that they ate (laughter), you know, too.  So it was, it was a, it was, it was a much, it was interesting.  I mean I grew up and said wait, wait a minute.  With all of the vegetables and, and, and yet people would come visit, and, and, and half of the stuff on the food table they weren't even, had never been exposed to, just, just vegetables and sometimes meats and, and so forth.  My mother on Sunday, it always was a roast beef or, or veals and lambs, all that, all, all of the whole, whole, whole, you know, school of, of, of foods and, and everything because then and later on, I, I began, I learned that it was because of my grandfather having grown all that stuff.  He grew all of this stuff for them, started out, but then he, you know, he grew it for his own family.
Story_ID: 276524
Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself growing up?  What would you, what, what kind of a kid were you?
Speaker 2: I--it's very interesting you ask me that 'cause at, at the roast that they had for me, Phylicia [Rashad] brought me on stage when, when the roast started.  She was the one, you know--
Speaker 1: And you're talking about a roast that [HistoryMaker] Woodie King [Jr.]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Woodie King (unclear)--
Speaker 1: --hosted for you I guess--
Speaker 2: --hosted.
Speaker 1: --about a week ago, right?  Is it not too long ago?
Speaker 2: What, about five weeks ago probably--
Speaker 1: Five weeks ago, okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah, five, six weeks.  Anyway, Phylicia was the one who, who, you know, introduced me and brought me on stage.  But before she brought me, she came and says, and she said something that sort of shocked me (unclear).  She says, "When did they know you were trouble?"  So at first I didn't, I wasn't, I didn't realize what she was talking about.  And then what she was asking me, 'cause she wanted, she wanted some information about, thinking that when, when did my parents [Dorothy Short Ward and Roosevelt Ward, Sr.] know that I was, I was, I was troublesome.  And I, I, I, I, thought for a while and, and, and then I real--I said no, no.  I said I was never really conventionally troublesome.  I said it was my, my concentrated, my concentrating on books that made me absent-minded.  So I says like, so therefore, my trouble to them was always a fact they just sent me, they'll send me to, to, to the store for sugar, and I'll come back with flour, you know, 'cause (laughter), my head was in a book.  And, and my mother said, "Boy, if you don't get the head out of--I send you to get some, some sugar, and you come back with flour. I mean can't you remember?"  But the thing, once I learned how to read, which they did, they did long before I was of school age, soon as they taught me the ABCs, I must have been no more than three, three years old or something, and that was it.  I mean, you know, it was almost something I, something just opened up, I mean I was just, just, the fascination and, and, and, and so forth in terms of reading.  So by the time I even went to, started school, I was already pretty much able to read.  And the, question you asked me is that I wasn't not a convin- I wasn't, wasn't troubled in, in a way, because my focus, my, my concentration always was, was, was elsewhere, you know, in that, in, in, in, in, in that sense.  I was always very curious, you know, as, as, as a child, but I, but I was, I was, as my mother and them would say, I had, my head was always in books.
Speaker 1: So you were kind of absent-minded, forget stuff, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yep, 'cause I, it wasn't absent.  I, I wasn't interested in anything but what I was interested in.  So I mean I didn't pay no attention to nothing except for what I was in, so that then made me--it's like, you know, boy, you're not listening.  You don't remember (laughter), you know.  To, to other people it was like I wasn't remembering, I wasn't listening.  But to me, it wasn't like I wasn't, I wasn't (laughter), I wasn't paying much attention because I was focused some, somewhat (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what, what kind of--
Speaker 2: --internally.
Story_ID: 276525
Speaker 1: What kind of materials did you have to read?  Did you read the black news (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Any, any--
Speaker 1: --papers or--
Speaker 2: --everything and anything.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See, I was a sponge.  I--anything, you, you know, anything that, anything that, that, that fell under my eye that had, had print on it, words, and that was everything.  I mean like, for instance, I grew up eventually 'Rangeland Romance[s],' all of the pulp, the pulp books, I mean anything.  You know, you, you find it on, on, on, in the garbage can or whatever--'Rangeland Romance,' True Confession[s], you know, romance stories.  I'm reading this shit when I'm (laughter), I'm seven, eight years old now, the, the, the, the pulp, all of the pulp stuff, the, the, the, the, the, the nasty books, the pornographic, you know, the Popeye books, anything (laughter) (unclear) anything that had words or print on it.  And this continued and still continues (laughter) throughout my life.  So by the time, then by the time I went to school, anything that was in the school library was fair game for me, I mean before I, I only went to, to, to graduate from primary school, public school.  In almost the one year I was there, I almost wound up reading every (laughter), everything in, in, in the li- anything, everything.  Any, anything I laid my hands on I would, I, I was, I was, you know, I was reading it.  And so, by the time, I've said earlier, by the time I'm eleven, twelve years old, I'm buying books, adult books.  I thought I was gonna get put out of high school, for instance, in my second year or so, when I'm twelve years old, no more than thirteen, 'cause I went--when I was precocious enough, I wound up in high school at about eleven.  So by twelve or thirteen, I almost, I was going to Catholic school, Xavier Prep [Xavier University Preparatory School], in New Orleans [Louisiana].  And I'm, I'm not interested in, you know, in, in, in, in what, what it, what the, the, the teachers are teaching reading 'cause I'm, I'm, you know, I'm, I'm beyond that.  So I'm bringing in my own books, and under the desk I'm reading while they, the lessons are going on.  And I'll never forget I bought a book, 'Aphrodite' by Pierre Louys, a French book.  This is, you know, it's out of--and I, well, I guess I bought, bought it because it was provocative, and particularly because it was dealing with, with, with, with, with, with, I didn't know, wouldn't even know the word lesbian at that time.  All I know is that their dealing about these women on, on Lesbos [sic. Alexandria, Egypt] (laughter), you know.  And, but it was high poetry.  I mean it was not like nasty you know.  But you know, as, as a child, I mean high poetry, as long as it's describing some, some (laughter), you know, sexual episode that's nasty, and you know, that's, that's, that's, that's what you want to read.  So I'm reading this book, and Sister caught me, and I always laugh.  To this day, I still say I'm waiting to be, to, to be taken to the principal office, and my parents [Dorothy Short Ward and Roosevelt Ward, Sr.] to be called in, and them sisters gon' expel me for, with this dirty book.  Anyway, make a long story short, I never saw the book.  And I waited day after day for about a week, and I knew, you know, I knew it was gon'--she, she just waitin'.  She's just making me sweat and waiting for the axe to, to fall, and it never did.  So (laughter), I always say Sister must have taken that book to her own self (laughter), 'cause I never, she never said a, she never mentioned it, and I never mentioned it to her.  The only thing I was out of, I was out of about five dollars because the book, you know, the book was a kinda hardback cover book.  And at that time, a twelve-year-old kid spending five dollars that was like months of pay, pay for, for somebody working hard or something like that.  But, at that point, I'm reading, reading that sort of book.  I'm, that's why I say I, I always remember that it wasn't 'Native Son' [Richard Wright] it was, it was 'Black Boy' [Richard Wright].  I think whatever year that book came out [1945], I remember saving my money and buying it.  And then 'Black Boy,' the two most impactful books on me early was 'Black Boy,' Richard Wright's 'Black Boy' and Studs Lonigan's Chicago trilogy, James [T.] Farrell.  Now I'm reading the, the Lonig- 'Studs Lonigan' trilogy thirteen, you know, fourteen years old.
Story_ID: 276526
Speaker 1: And you asked me (laughter) what I was, what I was, how would I describe myself as, as, as a, as a child and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But those two works--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --let's explore those a minute.  Like, these are both stories of, stories of growing up, you know, and dealing with conflict and you know, obstacles and stuff with 'Black Boy,' Richard Wright.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's a book, I confess I didn't get past the first chapter.  I read the first chapter.  It's just when they burned the house down, I was done.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 2: I said dang, you know, I don't even want to go any further than this.  And my daughter just read it in high school last week
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, she had to read it for a test.  'Studs Lonigan,' [James T. Farrell] I've never read it, but I, I hear it's, you know, the Irish story in--
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, but the thing--
Speaker 2: --Chicago [Illinois].  I mean those stories--
Speaker 1: --the thing that attract me is like these, these were realistic works.  See, now, with all of my compendious, compendious reading, as I said, that crossed all boundaries, all barriers and of genres, and, and, and the high literature, and pulp literature and comic books and the whole thing, suddenly to encounter 'Black Boy' and 'Studs Lonigan,' this is, this, this, this, this is real life; this is realistic.  This is talking about, narratively, this talking about the details of realism.  You know, this is not fancy; this is not made up; this is not a, a romance; this is not a cowboy story; this is not an exaggerated pornographic, you know, (laughter) thing.  This is real.  These, you're encountering real people.  Now, of course 'Black Boy,' the resonance is like this is about next door.  It's about my own.  This is about the you know, I can, I can touch this, because I come out of the same environment, the racist South, the milieu of the racist South, the segregated, the segregation.  This is, this is, this is really about me.  'Studs Lonigan' is about the Irish, but it's about the environment of poor whites, poor people.  Forget about the fact that--and [James T.] Farrell is dealing with them with exactitude in detail.  He's dealing with young boys, with all of the, the, the, the, the instincts and passions and, and, and of, of, of, of growing into manhood with their incessant desires about girls, and when they (laughter), when they gonna lose their virginity, and how their gonna lose their virginity, and their, their odyssey in trying to lose their virginity, and how they, you know, the sensual, sexual elements of the growing up and the hormonal and the testerone [testosterone]-driven world and, and, and yet the harshness, the harshness of Chicago working class, the, the dangers, the threats, the all--this, this, you know, through act of, of, of, of, of, of identification transformation and emp- empathy it could very much be about, you know.  It, it's not about necessary racism, but it's about prejudice; you know, it's about ethnic prejudice.  And then, you know, their, their, their, their, their, their role and plight and, and situation in Chicago is not far different, you know, from black folks in, in, in, in that milieu.  So this, but it's real.  It's, the, it's the texture and, and, and, and the, the truth of real life.  It's not fanciful; it's not made up; it's not imaginatively, imagin- imaginative transmutation or transformation into your, another, another world, another plane of existence.  This is, this is earthly, earthy, earthly, factual, and you could identify.  So, this is enormous; you know, this is enormous discovery, enormous resonance in terms of enormous education and revelation and so forth, at what I'm saying at such a, such, such a early age.
Story_ID: 276527
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Did you kind of compare and contrast the two stories, I mean 'Black Boy' [Richard Wright] and ['Studs Lonigan' James T. Farrell]--
Speaker 1: At that time, no, because there, the, they, they, they, they both impressed me similarly without, you know, without, without making a comparison.  If anything, the discovery of these Irish, Irish life in Chicago [Illinois] was a revelation.  You know, the 'Black Boy' I could, hey, not, you know, like you say, it was different in many ways, and, and, and his, his harshness of his, his, his life, his background was quite different, despite the fact I'm living in, in, in the same milieu of segregation.  So I'm, I'm basically living in a, in a protected environment.  I'm in a loving family with, with a whole extended family.  And no matter how harsh the, the racism and, and, and so forth, I mean we, you know, we got a whole social community that is nurturing.  (Laughter) You know, I, I'm not even faced with the har- the threat from, for me in relation to the, the, the segregate- the, the environment is from the outside.  It's not inside, but if you're remember with 'Black Boy,' I mean Richard Wright, shit, some, some, some of the, some of the harshness of his own internal re- life and relationship with, with--I don't remember the detail, but I mean, you know, I'm--
Speaker 2: His was cold.
Speaker 1: --it's cold.  His shit is ca- I mean that shit was cold.  You know, it wasn't just about white folk in pov- black folks.  You know, it's cold.  And I'm, just the opposite.  I'm warm, but my threat is from the, the outside.
Speaker 2: Now--
Speaker 1: And eventually that's gonna shape me and shape my consciousness, the fact that--and it's gonna help make me what I am because it's--
Speaker 2: Now--
Speaker 1: --I will never be and never develop--
Speaker 2: Now--
Speaker 1: --in with an internal negativity towards my people or my relationship, but I will be fierce (laughter) about that external world which is--put those obstacles in front of us.
Story_ID: 276528
Speaker 1: Did the church have much impact on you growing up or--
Speaker 2: Ironically, my mother [Dorothy Short Ward] was a very smart woman without, without showing it.  My mother, of course, was a good, churchgoing woman.  For some reason my grandfather, her father [Joseph Short], they were not, they were not, you know, we were not Catholics, but they, they also weren't--I don't--they might have gone to the, the, the church that I remember out in the country because it was the church.  But as far as, as, as denomination, my grandfather was Methodist.  So my mother, in growing up in the city [New Orleans, Louisiana], my, my, my mother was Methodist, not eve- even the, the regular Methodist, not even the African A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal].  It wasn't A.M.E.  It as the regular Methodist, even though it was the black, the black churches were part of it, and they're no different from the A.M.E.; it was the same, same cultural thing, even as, as, as my mother would probably say, even less, less, less external (laughter), you know, show of, of emotion and shouting and so forth but still culturally the same, you know, little, little more prissy and pristine a little in a, in a way.  But when I say she was smart is that, I guess by the time in dealing with me, my, my, my curiosity in reading and going my own way in terms of like what I was interested in, she didn't force me into a religious mode of belief.  And when I say she, how she did it, she was very smart.  She, she, she required only one thing.  I had to go to Sunday school, and Sunday school, of course, was, was only about half-hour.  You know, Sunday school always was half-hour at the church on Sundays, preceding the regular church.  She never insisted that I go to the regular service.  She made it my choice.  And that was a bargain; that was a good bargain for me because, I mean going to Sunday school, that was, that was all right, I mean especially since it was no more than half-hour to forty-five minutes.  I didn't have to sit there for two hours or so through the whole thing.  And I loved to go to Sunday school beca- besides reading by now, as I grew up, I also did my reading out loud.  And since I was so adept at reading and, and was so far advanced, I mean everybody, you know, always asked me to read, do the reading, as the, the child who's asked to read, read.  And I didn't mind going to Sunday school because I, you know, could read out loud and so forth, so it was a pleasurable.  But I took her up on her, on my option, and, and I didn't go (laughter), I didn't go.  I would go to Sunday school, and then, then I'd pass her by (laughter) going back home or go and do what I was gon' do as she was going to the regular church.  Most of my buddies that, who belonged to the same, parents belonged to that same church, man, they used to look and, and, and almost wanted to choke me because their parents made them go to the regular service, which mean that half of their afternoon was (laughter), was spent at church 'cause they had to sit through the whole church and I was, I was gone.  You know, I was gone on my own to do whatever I needed to do.  And she never did; she always made it an option.  And when I say she was smart, her reason for that is that, look: if I as gonna join church, I'll join it on my own impetus, that I would have a true--if I wanted to become a member of church and join church, that it would be an honest true choice; it would not be pressured or forced, because that would not be in, in her term, that would not be, you know, that, that would, would not be a true vocation; you know, I was doing it, you know, people forcing you to do it or you do it just for a routine of it.  But if I really did it on my own, I'd made a choice, and that would make me a true Christian believer in the church and so forth.

Speaker 1: --And what she [Ward's mother, Dorothy Short Ward] didn't take into consideration is that with my intellectual curiosity--I was going to Catholic school [Xavier University Preparatory School, New Orleans, Louisiana].  I was impressed by the early, my first two years are impressed by the ritualistic aspect of some of the Catholic, you know, things I had to go to.  You know, Sisters, they were smart enough.  They didn't proselytize in, in making you become Catholic, but they, it was there.  They were there; you were there; and you had to do certain things, to go to assembly and services of the church.  It was left up to you to make the decision if you wanted to become Catholic.  The first couple of years I was impressed, and then they, then a, a black priest came and spoke or something like that.  Then I was, fooled myself and said oh, God, they got a black priest; maybe I, I'll become a, a priest.  But I knew that wasn't last too long in the first place because I need my, my hormones and testerone [testosterone] was telling me some other stuff by then.  But anyway, the first two years, both in, in Catholic and then Sunday school was cool.  But, I must say that by the time I'm hitting fourteen and, and close to fifteen, my reading, my, my intellectual, my, my, my beginning to be aware of the contradictions of the world: the segregation on one hand, and the, and, and, and the, you know, and, and, and the passivity on, by the, the, the, the nuns, even though they're giving us a great education when it came to all of the social evils that began to happen and the incidents that happened in New Orleans [Louisiana] and some, sometimes very brutal, violent in, incidents of people being killed, fathers and, and, and relatives of people going to school winding up being killed by them southern crackers, police, and so forth, and Sisters not being able to deal with that, going to the church and, and even going to, to the Methodist church and a black church and, and, and not seeing too many people dealing with the outside world.  And the way that I began to feel had to be dealt with.  All these contradictions were beginning to affect me in the sense that I said wait a minute.  Something is, something is wrong--

Speaker 1: What was the first school you attended?  What was your first, your grade school?
Speaker 2: My, my first school I attended, and I was just talking to a cousin of mine down in Lou- (laughter) New Orleans [Louisiana] about it last week, 'cause she wound up going to the same school we wound up going to a school that basically was, was, was called Miss Jessie [ph.] (laughter).  This, this was a, is what, what I said later: this is a progressive educator who didn't know she was even being progressive (laughter).  I mean she had a one, one, two-room schoolhouse, schoolroom that she taught all and just like the old, old, old system in the country where she taught all grades together, all students together, whatever age group.  And the only criteria was, was you pass, you pass when she thought you should pass from one grade to another (laughter), you know.  Now, I wound up being, going to high school [at Xavier University Preparatory School, New Orleans, Louisiana].  Because of going to that school, I passed through all of the primary grades in, in, in, in, in two years.  (Laughter) I mean I passed all of the grades.  I joke, I say--
Speaker 1: So what are you, about--
Speaker 2: --I stay--
Speaker 1: --about an eight or, or--
Speaker 2: Yep, all of 'em.  I was, I was, I was, the only thing that caused me--I had to go--she was not, what do you call it?
Speaker 1: Certified?
Speaker 2: Certified.  So, in order to go to high school, I had to go to a regular public school to be certified, to go on.  So my last year I went one year, when I said I read all the books in the library.  I went to McDonogh No. 6 [New Orleans, Louisiana], which was a New Orleans public school and, and in order to be, to get a cer- certificate to, to go to high school.  But my first two years with her I passed--well, let, let me say the first, my first going to school was I was sent away while I was still in the, in, in Burnside [Louisiana], since I said there was no, no school there.  And that gave my father [Roosevelt Ward, Sr.] good, a good opportunity later to, to, to move partly for that reason.  But they sent me to an aunt to go away to school for the first time.  The first year they sent me I was too young, and they wouldn't take me, so I had to go back and wait another year.  But by, by the time I, I did go, I went to stay with an aunt during the school year for two years.  Now, where I went to school now is just a, just really part of--
Speaker 1: This is in--
Speaker 2: --New Orleans.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's Kenner [Louisiana].  When you go to New Orleans now you, the, the plane lands at the--
Speaker 1: It's called--
Speaker 2: --airport [Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, Kenner, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: --it's called Kenner?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Kenner, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it's actually like a little, where the airplane lands to go to New Orleans.  As soon as you come out the, the gate it's right there.  I mean it's like a, like it's almost connected to New Orleans.  It's not even a suburb anymore.  New Orleans just extends itself.  But at that time--
Speaker 1: So--okay.
Speaker 2: --when I was young, there was still a little separation.  It's only, it was like ten miles from--
Speaker 1: So, how--
Speaker 2: --from the city.
Speaker 1: --how old were you then?
Speaker 2: I was six when I first went.  The first, the first year I went, they sent me, I was five, and I was too, too young so they wouldn't take me.  I had to wait another--
Speaker 1: At Kenner?  I mean Kenner?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at Kenner.
Speaker 1: Wow, so you--
Speaker 2: Then, I waited another year, and I went at six.  And I spent one year there and then a second year, and then I was living with an aunt of mine who, who lived there, who also--I had other cousins who also came from the country, same area that I came from, who people sent to stay with her in, in order to go to school.  I went to school there for two years.  The problem was the second year--the first year they felt, the teachers felt that none of the kids at school were equipped to go to second grade, so I had, I was the only one they thought could go to second grade.  So they repeated the same first year course.  And since I was the one, only one, they couldn't have a whole (laughter) second grade for me, so I had to repeat, stay in the same grade with the other kids who they didn't deem, the teachers didn't deem--could take second, second grade work.  But, as I said, by this time, I'm already able, able to read, in a way, so it wasn't no big, big thing just staying back, as they put it.
Story_ID: 276531
Speaker 1: My folks [Dorothy Short Ward and Roosevelt Ward, Sr.] in the meantime during that two-year period had moved to New Orleans [Louisiana].  They finally made the move to New Orleans and then waited until I finished that second year for me to join them in New Orleans proper.  Now, once I get to New Orleans, that's when I go to the progressive school, Miss Jessie [ph.].  Now, when I got to Miss Jessie, Miss Jessie start me out first place by, she gonna find out where I am, you know, in terms of my ed- what I'm equipped to do.  So when I go there, I stay in first grade one day.  You know, I've already had--I stay in second grade maybe a week, now, you know, (laughter) in her terms.  And then as I go along, just, I add incrementally a little more time, but by, in two years I'm finished with all of the grades.  I've, I've already, in two years I've, I've gone from first through seventh.
Speaker 2: So, so you're about ten years old now?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm--
Speaker 2: And, and then, then did you have to go to McDonogh's No. 6 [McDonogh No. 6, New Orleans, Louisiana]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, then I go to McDonogh, and then be, while I'm still eleven years old I'm going to high school.
Speaker 2: Okay, so, so you were at McDonogh's.  Was that a year, or--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I only stayed at McDonogh a year to--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --to get the certificate.  I go to Xavier Prep [Xavier University Preparatory School, New Orleans, Louisiana]--
Speaker 2: Okay
Speaker 1: --at eleven years old, and I'm out on making sixteen, even though I stayed back one year in order to play football.
Speaker 2: Okay, so, so you graduated at age sixteen.
Speaker 1: Yep, yeah.
Speaker 2: And that's, that's 1946?
Speaker 1: Forty-six [1946]--
Story_ID: 276532
Speaker 1: Did you feel like anybody really appreciated that aspect of you at that point?
Speaker 2: No, it, it's almost like I'm so, I'm so concentrated on, on, on, on learning till I'm, I'm not even a, I'm not even, (laughter) I'm not even paying attention to, I'm just getting in trouble as I said, by being absent-minded (laughter) about it and, and being considered, like, in, into my own world.  So I'm odd in that way to other people, but I'm, I'm internally concentrated, I'm not even thinking about--
Speaker 1: Now did, did you have any heroes, I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah
Speaker 1: --in, in the, in the community--
Speaker 2: Well, as I, as I--
Speaker 1: -that, that were--
Speaker 2: --went along, of course.
Speaker 1: Any people that you admired in the community or even outside the community that you read about that you--
Speaker 2: Well, my by, by, by this time I'm, my reading thing, part of, part, part, part of the, the--I'm going--it turns out, once my parents [Dorothy Short Ward and Roosevelt Ward, Sr.] moved to New Orleans [Louisiana], then the original family, the ones I talked about earlier, the, the, the, the [maternal] grandfather died when he was almost a hundred, the one who was married to Nathan Bedford Forrest's daughter [Dicey Forrest Short (ph.)].
Speaker 1: The Shorts and--
Speaker 2: The Shorts, Isaac Short.  He's my ca- he's providing me with a lot of my reading material because at that time I'm not, I don't, you know, I'm not think about why.  But suddenly this, this, as, as my friends later on in life said, this old white man, 'cause he was ramrod slim, slender, but, and, and light, you know, with as people call it good hair (laughter), you know, that sort of shit.  I mean it looked, looked like a, you know, an [President] Abraham Lincoln sort of face, face white man (laughter), shit.  But for some reason, he always got all these magazines, Life and all of The Saturday Evening Post, Life, all of this stuff.  And I'm getting most of my, my contemporary stuff from him and talking to him.  At that time, you know, I'm not, you know, I'm too young to, to have any, any, any conscious-oriented conversations with him, but, but you know, we rapping together and talking, and, and, and, and I'm, I'm impressed.  Some, there's something about him that, that, that puts him apart from everybody else in term--I'm getting material from all my, my relatives, his children, all of 'em, you know, the sort of com- you know, it's almost like a complex.  All of us lived in the same neighborhood.  Excuse me (coughing) I'm going from relative to relative, collecting books, magazines and stuff like that, but he was the most impressive one, you know.  I didn't know why then, and it was only later when I put it together with what I told you earlier about his history, in that he'd been heavily involved in the politics.  And he was still consciously aware, and even I think later on in life with his obituary I read stuff that I didn't, wasn't aware of when I was, you know, a, a, a youngster about what was said about his, his activity in relation to the community and relation to his, his relationship and, and work as a pull, in the Pullman, as a Pullman porter.  Apparently he'd risen as high as a black could rise as a pull, in, in the Pullman porter company at that point and eventually became one of the one I guess instructors, 'cause all this--except for my grandfather, his other children, my grandfather younger brothers and my uncles became Pullman porters, that whole, whole thing.  So, he was one of my, I wouldn't say later on I would put the term hero on it, but he was one of most impressive people on me.  Then, of course, the, at that time there were people who arose in the community who I read about who I admired.  And then, of course, of course, there were teachers.
Story_ID: 276533
Speaker 1: Who were some of the names of the people that you really knew (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, I don't ev- I don't remember names as much as areas of act- you know, there was a couple of, couple of lawyers, for instance, who were leading the fight against some of the legal segregation things there and then there were a couple of ministers, couple of lawyers, and then there was a union.  And I always remember the unions, the, the, the, the, the Longshoremen Union.  The New Orleans Longshoremen['s] Union was one of the most powerful black organizations in the South, because the Longshoremen Union, the, the, the longshoremen, the black, black union was even more, more, more powerful than the white union because most of the longshoremen then were doing the work were really blacks.  And they, they had a very powerful union, and they were very independent, and they, they, the, the people who were involved, the leaders of that union were some of the pioneers in terms of the Civil Rights Movement later on and then, and the voting rights and, and, and, and, and, and so forth.  But you also have to remember that the period that I'm talk, I'm, I'm, I'm going through the Second World War [World War II, WWII], so I'm living during the Second World--
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.
Speaker 2: --War.  So, a lot of the attention and focus is on what's happening in relation to the war and, and, and black activity in, in, involved in the war, especially with uncles and so forth by this who were in the war.  But I mean there were, you know, there were reports about blacks' participation in term, in, in, in, in, in terms of the war.
Speaker 1: It's also the Joe Louis era (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and all that.
Speaker 2: Joe Louis, the Joe Louis experience there is as vivid to me--the first fight, the loss to [Max] Schmeling is as vivid to me as, as you've seen it and, and, and recorded in, in literature, in plays, such and such.  I, to this day, remember my grandfather's quarters, where my [maternal] grandfather [Joseph Short] lived, nobody had a radio except the, the, the, the white straw boss or foreman, who apparently, you know, they thought of was a halfway decent man.  They had the, we had to go to hear the fight by sitting on his por- his gallery; I mean his little porch area.  The radio is playing inside, you know, but the screen door, the screen that's, you know, he let stay, you know, stay open so that we could hear it on the porch.  I will always remember the night of that fight, being on that porch with, with, with my relative.  I don't, don't remember all of 'em who was there, but I, I remember being there.  And I remember leaving in total silence, being taken back to, to, to, you know, go, go, go to bed and a pall of disappointment that settled around all of the people in, in, in, in hearing that fight and Joe Louis' defeat.
Story_ID: 276534
Speaker 1: Now, there's a second part to this Joe Louis story.  Now, now we, we did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well, it, the irony about it is the, is the first, the fir- what year was the first one?  It's 1930 what?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA MALE VOICE):  [Max] Schmeling (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Schmeling, '35 [1935], '36 [1936]?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Which one?  So, you can see that I'm still too young, to a certain extent, to, to (unclear) so I'm, it's like I'm, you know, it's just, just strange.  We go with all this enthusiasm listening to the fight, and, and, and, and then suddenly silence.  And so something had happened, something bad had happened.  The pra- the thing about this, the victory is that by this time I'm older, and I, I don't, I don't even remember, I don't even remember too much about where I was as much as I remember that first one, the defeat, I remember.  I, I, I don't have the remember of, memory of exactly where I was.  It's almost like the victory part for me is almost anticlimactic 'cause as a child I just remember the gloom of the first one.  And, and of course, I shared in the jubilation of, of, of the second one.  But I don't, (laughter) I don't, I, I can't pinpoint it quite, quite as that, you know, as, as, you know, as exact.  But the sports, you know, the, the, the sports heroes suddenly I, I, with all my reading of course, by now, and then eventually I, I became, of course, besotted and interested in, in, in, in, in football because I wanted to become a football player.  And I even stayed a year back in high school [Xavier University Preparatory School, New Orleans, Louisiana] because I knew I was, I was, hadn't developed yet physically enough to, to be competitive, so I stayed back a year just to, to mature more.  But, in reading in sports, you know, just like I'm reading everything else, I read sports like extensively.  By this time, I'm beginning to focus on those schools, collegiate schools, who allowed black players to, to play for 'em, you know, like Jackie Robinson.  I, I, you know, I remember Jackie Robinson and it, and it, and, and, and his, his brother from UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California]--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Mack.
Speaker 2: --Mack Robinson, at UCLA, in, in, in terms of the long jump and then, then Jackie Robinson.  And then, but more, more important, I remember the, the Big Ten [Conference].  'Cause as a conference except--UCLA was, you always remembered UCLA as, as the, the one, the one out in, in, in, the one school out on the West Coast.  But the Big Ten in general was ahead of everybody in terms of there were five or six teams that allowed blacks to play.  It wasn't, you know, not any in great number.  But the one I really fixated on was, was, was Michigan, University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].  And what happened is, is when I found out that the Univer- University of Michigan had had an All-American in the, in the mid-'30s [1930s], you know, I mean then, then, then that was, then that was a school I, I, I dreamed about.  I had to go to--you know, if I was gonna be All-American football player I had to go to University of Michigan.  And, and, and, and, and Michigan lived up to my expectations, because after I read about the, the, the lineman--I forgot his name--in the '30s [1930s], then by time, '40 [1940] or '41 [1941], not only did they had, had, had, had, had, they had a, they had All-American Julius Franks [Jr.].  And I think Julius Franks was even captain of, of, of the team [sic.], so I mean, of course, this is, this was an event.  So, so athletically, I'm dealing with, with the heroes and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and anybody who, who showed that they, they were none prejudice.  And of course, the other hero--I wasn't as in, interested in baseball so I didn't, I didn't concentrate that much on the, the Negro Leagues.  But the Negro Leagues were always there.  I mean it was just normal.  In fact, one of my best friends now in New Orleans [Louisiana], his uncle used to be one of the people who, who some of the, the, the great players used to stay with, which was right around the corner from my house, 'cause you know, all the Negro--I mean that's why the, the players in the Negro League, when people talkin' about segregation, they say oh, man, shit, don't, we, we had a good time.  You know, they ate the best food; they staying (laughter) in the best, best folks' house, you know.  I mean they had the best women and liquor and every, so they said we, we didn't suffer (laughter).  We didn't suffer that much from not playing with, especially since they were beatin' the shit out of the white, white players in the summer, when, as we all know, the white players were making more money barnstorming with the black players in the summer after the regular players.  They made more money playing in, playing against and, and, and you know, the, the black players in those barnstorming tours.  Now it was Dizzy Dean, all of them.  They, they (laughter) getting paid.  They made more money on those tours, so, you know, the black, black players, even though they weren't playing in the Major Leagues, they knew how good they were.  They were already beatin' the shit (laughter) out of the white players, the stars of the white leagues.  But I wasn't too concentrated because baseball wasn't exactly my main--football, I was, I was just, as I said--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --besotted with--
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: --football (simultaneous)--
Story_ID: 276535
Speaker 1: So you played football in high school, right?
Speaker 2: Yep, I played--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --football in high school, but I, I even graduate, I still graduated too soon to live up to my own ambition.
Speaker 1: Had you been--well, now you're about six one I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You're pretty (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --probably pretty good-sized--
Speaker 2: Right, yeah--
Speaker 1: kid--
Speaker 2: --and I, I, I--
Speaker 1: --in high school.
Speaker 2: --was, I was, I wasn't, at that time, even in high school, I was, I was not considered big, but I was considered, even hundred and sixty at that time for, for, for a running back, you know, was considered--
Speaker 1: That's pretty good.
Speaker 2: --good--
Speaker 1: --you know, good, good size.  I had, of course, dreams and, and, and illusions and imagination about, as I said, living in this, being All-American thing.  And--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear) was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I did get a chance eventually to live up to (laughter) my, my--I did go to University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].  I did play on, on, on the freshmen team, but--and, and thankfully--
Speaker 2: Now, well, well, before we get you there, now, now, tell us about graduation from Xavier [University Preparatory School, New Orleans, Louisiana].  Was that, that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, yeah, the, the thing that I started off earlier to talk about when I said that, that suddenly I was, I was getting not cynical but, but beginning to, to realize the contradictions of the society I was living in and as particularly as it came down to, to, to religion and so forth is that suddenly I, by the time, in my mid-high school career I'm beginning to question, I'm beginning to question the, the, not religion, per se, but the contra, you know, but the, the, the--I'm beginning to see some hypocrisies in relation to organized religious belief that began to, to cross over all of the, the religion.  It wasn't like one over the other.  I just began to say oh, okay, something is, something, something is not right.  You can't (laughter), you can't have all these belief systems and, and things be the way they are.  Being in a Catholic school, of course, my focus then eventually began focusing particularly against them.  So by the time, almost by the time I'm ready to get, graduate, I'm almost, I'm almost ready to pretty much an intuitive agnostic.  And that affected my attitude towards Catholic.  It also then put an obstacle in the way of I guess my mother's [Dorothy Short Ward] hopes.  By make, giving me the option to make my own choice, she (laughter) didn't realize that she didn't, she didn't figure on the fact that it would never occur to me to make that choice, that, but that, that, that suddenly before I'm out of high school, I'm a, I'm almost making an opposite choice by tuning out on not wanting to become, not wanting to join church.  So, and I'm sure that was a disappointment to her, but she, as I said, she, she never, she never said anything about it because she had, she had herself made the, gave me the choice, and she, she, she, she respected it.
Story_ID: 276536
Speaker 1: Were you involved in high school activities, clubs and stuff?  Did you run for office or any of that kind of stuff?
Speaker 2: No.  I was, I was essentially--those years in high school, I was, I was almost essentially too young to be in the forefront of anything like that, to be a so-called leader.  I mean I was--everybody was in awe of me for, as I said, my (laughter), my, my, my advanced ability in terms of particularly, particularly reading, it's like in all of the classes, I mean all; I mean when the, when the teacher asked everybody to read out loud, and everybody is, is hiding and so forth, and then I know that, hey, this is gon' get me through, and it did.  I mean I, you know, I knew that as long as, long as the Sisters or anybody, I, long as I volunteered to read, and I read like that that I ain't gon' have to do much of, of nothing the rest of the way (laughter). You know, even if I make a F on the test, they gon' pass me through because I, I volunteered to read.  So I'm slick.  I'm smart.  People were awed with, with those elements of me, but I was too young to really be in the forefront.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Just like even athletically I was on, I, I stayed back one year, and I still--I'm, I'm, I, my last year of football was at fifteen years old.  (Laughter) I'm, I'm fifteen--
Speaker 1: That's when other people are starting (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that's, right.  I'm at the start--my, my buddies, all of my, my childhood buddies of my age and three years behind me.  And they, most, I was graduated when most (laughter), when, when most of my buddies were just starting.  And I'm finishing my athletic high school, athletic career at the time when most people are starting.  It just was a fantasy of mine that I could even think that I was gonna go and become an All-American when I hadn't been able to develop.  So similarly to the fact that I was out of high school before I could develop.  Shit, I'm out of high school before I can date almost, you know.  So when somebody ask me, you know, all of the regular dating thing or a boy/girl thing, I don't have too much experience with that because I'm in high school lusting behind all of these girls, but all these (laughter), all these girls are older than me, and they ain't interested me.  They're interested in, in, in eighteen, nineteen, twenty-year-old dudes and suddenly I'm fourteen.  You know what happen when you're fourteen.  You're lusting after (laughter) everything.  But I'm, I'm, I'm even though I'm big for my age, I'm still not (laughter) competitive with all of the dudes ahead of me and is even behind me, to a--because they're older.  So my whole, my whole high school experience and so forth in terms of what you're saying there is none of those things.  I'm gone; you know, I'm gone (laughter) before, before I've even developed in all of these, these, these areas.  But--
Speaker 1: Now, now were you--
Speaker 2: But I did participate in--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --certain things, like, for instance, there were special things where, like, that involved, let's say reading. The Sisters, like would have these competitions, state competition.  I remember doing Polonius advice to, to Laertes' son [sic.].  The Sister got me to do it before the, the, the, the state something.  I didn't win, but I mean I was involved in it.  Before I could play football, my aunt, who was like my sister, was the singing star of the school.  And, and, and the Sisters had a very good music program basically centered around operettas, Gilbert and Sullivan [W.S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan], and she was the star of that.  So before I played, could play football, a year before I could play football, I was looking to participate in, in extracurricular activity.  And I decided, you know, just to, to be part of the, the, the Gilbert and Sullivan chorus for Pirates and Penzance ['The Pirates of Penzance'], when my sister--
Speaker 1: Was, was, was that your first theatrical--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, but, but--
Speaker 1: --piece?
Speaker 2: --the irony about it, I'm in it for--not, I'm, I'm not in it because I'm thinking about (laughter) ever, thinking about becoming part of theater.  My, my aunt, this is her milieu.  I'm just trying to find something to do (laughter), you know.  And, and since she was in it and so forth, I decided to, you know, just--I, I wasn't in it because I was thinking about the--
Speaker 1: Were, were, were you impressed by the right--I mean pi- 'Pirates of Penzance' has a, it has a lot of political contradictions and, and--
Speaker 2: I wasn't even aware of it.
Speaker 1: --kind of--
Speaker 2: All I remember is trying to struggle through (laughter) learning to come (singing), "Here is my--," whatever, I mean the chorus, choral part of it.  It was just for me to pass time the year before I could play football.  And by the time the next year, of course, I, I, I was on the team and, and never thought about theater career.  The only thing that was the seeds to my theatrical interest was the fact that, when I talk about the, the, the Polonius advice to his son Laertes that I did in the recital thing and the reading thing.  The Sisters, as far as education, the, the Xavier Prep [Xavier University Preparatory School, New Orleans, Louisiana] and the, and the nuns, the Sisters of [the] Blessed Sacrament, were excellent in providing you with a basic, reading, writing, and arithmetic.  Now when it comes to interpretive subjects, forget it.  I mean they didn't teach you nothing about yourself, your, you know, society or anything but the foundational.  But the one thing that they were very good at, particularly, was, was, was, was, was, was, was traditional literature with an emphasis on [William] Shakespeare, which, hey, was, was quote Godsent, if you want to put it in a sense that this later on was excellent preparation.  I mean to be exposed to Shakespeare, it wasn't, you know, they--I was reading, and I didn't, I didn't miss out on, on contemporary stuff, because as I told you, I'm reading this stuff on my own.  So I'm not missing out on being taught contemporary stuff.  I'm doing the contemporary stuff on my own.  They are have, they are teaching me for grades--
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  Did--
Speaker 2: --Shakespeare.  And I'm reading it out loud in class.  So, so, all of that were seeds for dramatic later on, you know, dramatic preparation.
Story_ID: 276537
Speaker 1: Now did you graduate with honors [from Xavier University Preparatory School, New Orleans, Louisiana], or how did you, how did you, how (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I, I--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I not barely made out, but, but it was, it was up and down.  I would get excellent grades in what I was interested in or what I was good at.  And then I was flunking out in, in, in the subjects that I didn't have an interest in or, or, or (laughter), or couldn't--
Speaker 1: Now that's a--
Speaker 2: I mean when it came to math and science, I was the, I was, you know, that shit, I couldn't, I would've, I, they would have put me in, in--what, what they call the backward--
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: --class.
Speaker 1: It's an interesting dynamic 'cause you're not the only one that has that kind of, that had that kind of background.  But it's--
Speaker 2: Lorraine [Hansberry] who when I--
Speaker 1: --it's a com- it's common, you know--
Speaker 2: You, yeah, you're right.  Eventually, when, when Lorraine and I became friends, turned out we were (laughter) very similar (unclear).  Lorraine couldn't--math, that was a mystery to her and the same (laughter) with me, those subjects, you know.  Now, later on in life, some of the things that I couldn't abide then, I became interested in for its own right.  Like science, I became interested in when I saw its connection to, you know--there are many, many, many subjects that you just wanted to--I, I couldn't figure out why I need to know this.
Speaker 1: Now, now, in terms of college, I got University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] and Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Which one did you go to first and--
Speaker 2: Wilberforce was first.
Speaker 1: All right, now how did you make the hookup with Wilberforce?
Speaker 2: Wilberforce came--first place, my ambition was to go to, go to Uni- University of Michigan.  Right after '46 [1946], University of Michigan wasn't even accepting, they weren't even accepting applications from out-of-state students.  You got the, the G.I. is about to come back, the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944].  You got all of these factors.  Suddenly, University of Michigan I think more, a lot of colleges suddenly, in order to not be bursting at the seam with people they couldn't handle, put a stop on applications from out of state.  So I wasn't even, it, I, I couldn't even go to University of Michigan if I was equipped to go there academically.  So what happened is once I couldn't do that or couldn't apply, I had to find an alternative.  I was, but this time, I was determined I was not going to school in the South, free or not.  I mean I had, like, I couldn't have gone to Xavier University [of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana], Grambling [College; Grambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana], and Southern [University; Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] free.  I was determined that I had no interest in staying period in the South.  I mean I wasn't going to school in the South.  I don't care where.  But once I couldn't go where I wanted to go, and I wasn't gonna go where I could have gone, then I was left hanging.  And that time I had no real knowledge of, of schools, so I say okay, I'll go to a black, what we call now what tradia- traditionally historically black--
Speaker 1: Colleges--
Speaker 2: --schools [Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs)].  I'll go to a historically black school, but I got to find one that's not in the South.  And I got (laughter), I got, got, you know, my, my, my, my research together, and I began to eliminate 80 percent of 'em.  And it was about a 20 percent group that was, some of 'em hovering on the border like for when you talking about Baltimore [Maryland].  I check the marks, and know Morgan [Morgan State College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland], that's, that's still, still not close enough.  That's not, that's still close enough on the Mason-Dixon Line.  That, no, that's not, that's still too south for me; same thing happened with Lincoln [University] in, in [Jefferson City] Missouri.  I said no, that's Missouri; that's still too far south; that's too far.  Lincoln--and so I wound up with, eventually, through process of elimination, I wound up with Lincoln [University] in [Lincoln University] Pennsylvania and this place called Wilberforce in Ohio.  Pennsylvania was, that's north.  Ohio, that's resp- you know, that's rightfully north, so they, the two states, that was all right.  But then I found out that Lincoln in Pennsylvania was all-boys, and I said no, no.  That--so, so through the process of elimination, I wound up with Wilberforce.  I didn't know nothing about it, had never heard of it, didn't know (laughter), anything about it.  I knew it was in Ohio, which was north enough, and it was coed.
Story_ID: 276538
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Now this is interesting 'cause Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio], 1940--did you go there in '46 [1946] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yep.
Speaker 2: --forty-seven [1947].  Now, this is two years before it splits, so I guess--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: --it's a school--
Speaker 1: --now I'm gon' tell you, I'm gon' tell you--
Speaker 2: It's a school in crisis I guess--
Speaker 1: I, I'm gon' tell you what happened.
Speaker 2: --at this point, right?
Speaker 1: I know nothing about--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I didn't know--
Speaker 2: It's the oldest--
Speaker 1: --anything--
Speaker 2: Wilberforce and Lincoln [University, Lincoln University, Pennsylvania], the oldest blacks schools in--
Speaker 1: I know, but I knew nothing about it at all, didn't know anything about it.  All I knew was north and, and, and, and, and, and by this time it was close, because it took a long time for me in terms of finding out about Michigan not accepting invi- so my application was almost at the last minute.  I just made the application in time.  And then, this is the first time I'm even leaving home, going out of Louisiana period.  And I'll get on the train, and I'm, I'm headed for Ohio.  You know, I go to Xenia, Ohio, you know, and, and so forth.  And then I, I get to Xenia, Ohio, which is small enough, as you (laughter) know, 'cause you right there next--
Speaker 2: That's right, we know, yeah.
Speaker 1: You right there out of Dayton [Ohio].
Speaker 2: Yes sir.
Speaker 1: I mean you (laughter), you know fifteen, my house from, from Dayton.  And I'm, I'm, but this ain't Dayton; this is Xenia.  And I said wait.  How I'm going to get off--I don't know.  This, this is, I'm still in, in this little small, and that still ain't it.  I gotta get (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Go.
Speaker 1: --I got to get on the bus and go five more miles out in the cornfields and shit.  I mean, I said what have, where, where am I?  Where am I (laughter)?  Could, we could have been on the moon, you know, but I'm north; I'm north, until I was just--to jump the story, I found out that soon as I get on campus and, and school starts, I found out that the main thing that's happening on school with, with the, with the conscious students on campus is that they're picketing the movie house in Xenia for, for being segregated.  I said what (laughter)?  I've come all the way north; I come to Ohio, you know, this wonderful northern thing.  You know, it's gon' even be cold.  I mean this is, this is gon' be a whole--I'm free; you know, this is freedom.  And I come there fired up.  The first thing (laughter) they're doing is they're picketing the movie house for being segregated (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Speaking of--
Story_ID: 276539
Speaker 1: Just a little segue here (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but did the movies have much impact on you as a, as a kid growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.  They, they--
Speaker 1: Did you go to the movies a lot in New Orleans [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.  That's another, that's another story with the segregation component of the movies. We could only go to the main movie houses, the Loew's [State Theatre; State Palace Theatre, New Orleans, Louisiana] and the Orpheum [Theater, New Orleans, Louisiana], but we had to sit in, in, in the peanut gallery, in the third balcony.  Well, these are big houses, you know, and then, of course, you know the whole story about, 'bout the white people not being safe with us up there 'cause we throw shit down on 'em, popcorn, even spit or something like that.  And, and it was too big, it was too vast for the, anybody to come up and, and figure out who did it, you know.
Speaker 1: It's in the dark too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, too dark, too big, too, you know, too wide, and they could, could never find, so you do, did what you wanted.  And by this time, I said during the war [World War II, WWII], we be- we were became, becoming politicized in a sense of not a conscious politicization.  But the war was politicizing us in terms of, you fighting for freedom, well, what about our freedom here?  And we were beginning to develop these defiant attitudes.  So, some of the shit that we were even seeing on the screen, we were beginning to root for the Indians [Native Americans] and, and shit against the, the cowboys.  And, and, and, and when--I always remembered I wrote about it in, in a thing that, unfortunately, partly never came up with the money to do it.  There's a, was a centennial thing [Ol' Man River: A Centennial Salute to Paul Robeson] for, for, for Paul Robeson and partly got me to write this piece on my memory of Paul.  And I talked about growing up going to the movies and how when we first saw 'Gone with the Wind,' damn, we almost started throwing shit at the screen when we heard, heard this Miss Scarlett [O'Hara], Butterfly McQueen come out with that, that Miss Scarlett shit, and then, then the big old burly black saving his mistress from (laughter), you know, the rapers, the black rapers and all that shit.  Boy, we, we were infuriated with that shit, and this was at fourteen years old, so it's not like we were made conscious by some outside thing.  We, this was just our instincts.
Story_ID: 276540
Speaker 1: Going to, to, to Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --I get there, and, and you know, as I said, the, the campus is where it is.  The campus is, is now, as far as the masculine population, it is half, half G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944], so all these dudes, these, these are, these are men.  I'm in a dormitory talking about I'm, I'm, I'm in a dormitory at sixteen years old, and I realize right away, 'cause everything was so crowded, you wouldn't have a room.  You were in like a, a, a dormitory with, you know, eight to ten beds, you know (laughter), cots and shit.  And I'm there with all these ex-G.I.s almost, and I'm sixteen years--ain't no way in the world I can tell, I, I, I can tell them I'm that young.  So that, talking about acting that was my first real acting job, 'cause I had, I had to, I had to act my way into them thinking that I was much older.  And I was so slick by--I just kept my mouth shut, and that's how.  And, and you know, when you--a bunch of arguing men, if you're the one who keep your mouth shut, they think you're wise.  So when they get to (unclear) they'd turn around and say, "He'll tell you."  And all you do is mumble somethin' and say somethin', and, "See, see, I told you, man; I told you, you know; shit, I told you.  See, this many can tell you."  And I, I, I knew smart enough to keep my mouth shut and not expose my own inexperience or age and got (laughter), got away with it with all these, all, all these men, second world.  But it was good experience 'cause I mean it's, I'm, I'm, I'm not thrust into a relationship with men who's six, seven years older. Some of 'em been in every whorehouse in that, that they'd been a, around the world, (laughter) you know, wherever they've been stationed.  So I'm learning through osmosis.  I'm (laughter) learning, learning mature, mature, maturing through os- osmosis.  Now, of course, all of the women on campus is just the opposite.  They the regular age of college students, you know.  But once again, I'm put in the position I'm not competitive (laughter) with, I'm not competitive with, with, with these dudes, particularly in the coed thing.  But by the, that time, I'm beginning to act older anyway, so I'm beginning to get away with being older.  And, and, and that took me for many years, even coming to New York [New York], that, that became my modus operandi, that I was, I was able to pass for, for much older by seeming wiser and, and, and so forth.  And even, even some of the elements that eventually made me play all of the old men in, in black theater, was the fact that, you know, my heft, my height, my voice and everything, I was able to, to be convincing, having more weight than the age that I'll, that I actually was.  But Wilberforce, you're talking about in crisis.  I get there, and during that year, see, this is a crucial year.  Not only are you talkin' about--this is a crucial year.  I've suddenly discovered there that Wilberforce is--that, that my choice is, is, is serendipitous.  I find that I get to Wilberforce, Wilberforce has a president who is the protege of the great Carter [G.] Woodson, Charles [H.] Wesley, Carter Woodson's main protege (laughter) is the president of the school.  So, of course, the curriculum, he made sure the curriculum reflected not only what, what we would call now black studies.  We had Negro history right away as formal courses.  So you--suddenly I'm, I'm, I'm serendipitous.  After a, a basic education from them Sisters [at Xavier University Preparatory School, New Orleans, Louisiana], suddenly I'm on a campus where they're teaching as a formal discipline stuff about blacks, you know, Negro history.  And, and, and that's sudden--'cause, you know, whether it was a historian, as I said, and a protege of Woodson, and he made sure that there were classes.  And the whole atmosphere there and the social studies and so forth were dealing, you know, with, from at that time, a black point of view.
Story_ID: 276541
Speaker 1: We were talking about the African American history courses at Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --and how Charles [H.] Wesley put that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the, the, the interesting thing about it was, was, the greatest thing about Wilberforce was that suddenly here was a black school, ahead of its time in a sense of realizing this, the, the, the need and, and, and, and, and, and providing the perspective and education for the student body in, in learning about themselves from, from, from their perspective.  So, you had black history courses.  You had courses in which you were introduced to people and, and events and things that you never got in your regular education.  And even though I'd come out of Catholic school [Xavier University Preparatory School, New Orleans, Louisiana], I'm not, you wouldn't have, I wouldn't have got any better education at the, at that, at that all-black public school where all-black teachers (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)That's right.
Speaker 2: --were not teaching unless you just happened to run into somebody who just was, was, was conscious enough to include it, but here it was a systematically.  You know, it was not just individually.  Here it was in, in the, in, in the curriculum, you know, about yourself.  Man, this, this was, this was eye-opening.  I mean this, this was really, for all my life, for the rest of my life it was, it was something that, that, that, that, that was so, so enlightening.
Speaker 1: Can you remember some of the teachers' names that were teaching you?
Speaker 2: I don't even remember the teachers.  I don't--in order, in order--you have to go back for, for 1946 and see who was on the, who was, who was teaching those courses.
Speaker 1: I don't if Wilhelmina Robinson was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I don't--
Speaker 1: --she, she--
Speaker 2: --I wouldn't re--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm not very good at remembering.  The only thing I remember in terms of Wilberforce is courses.  The other question you asked me is suddenly my dramatic interest in both--educationally, I took, I got there and of course, as I said, in terms of, like, I was excellent in what I liked, and I was a, a, a idiot in what I didn't care about.  And Wilberforce also had a interesting thing in that they allowed, even though you had required subjects you had to take before you graduate, they didn't put any, any, any year on it.  So, you could take what you wanted to take as long as before you graduated you had to take what was required.  So, of course, me not wanting to deal with math and science, I didn't want to take.  I didn't have to take it.  Now in most schools you have to take a cross section of courses: the required and the a few elective, whatever.  Wilberforce, you could take whatever you wanted as long as you, you, you knew that you, that you couldn't escape it forever.  So what would happen if I had gone to Wilberforce for four years?  The first two years I'd been on the honor roll because I took what I wanted to take.  And I--but, but in two years I'd been finished with all of the courses offered that I wanted to take.  And the last two, the third year I'd flunked out, 'cause by that time I was supposed to take all the co- required courses that I had avoided.  So I would have been a genius (laughter) for two years and then a dummy for the, for the third year, and I never got to the fourth year anyway.  But it was, it was, it was, it was wonderful, and then just to be in that environment with somebody like Wesley--
Story_ID: 276542
Speaker 1: Now, what happened, I didn't know is that [Charles H.] Wesley, it turned out that Wesley was at loggerheads with the, the bishops who actually were the, the poobahs who ran the school [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio], even though the State of Ohio was putting up three-fourths of the budget.  And finally, that had become untenable.  Usually the president was always the fifth person in terms of the, between the state had four and the [African Methodist Episcopal] church had four on whatever the board was.  And the president always was, was, was, was, was the fifth, the, the deciding vote, but the president--tradition had always been with the church.  So even though the state was putting up the money, the church still controlled things.  For whatever reason, Wesley went with the state, and the bishops didn't take it lightly I mean, and they didn't take it at all.  So they then fired Wesley.  Now, by, when they tried to fire Wesley, of course, the state got the power of money, but more importantly, Wesley was beloved by the student body and the faculty.  So suddenly, I mean, the, the bishops became the, the, the ogres.  And one of 'em, [Reverdy C.] Ransom I think, was living right down the (laughter), right down the hill.  You remember?  If you go down there to the post office, right, you, behind the school, right up the edge, behind the school there was the post office.  And right behind the post office (laughter) was Bishop Ransom's residence, so you know what happened, is that by the time it reached the end of the school, the student body threatened not to go through with graduation, you know, boycott graduation.  And then we went down the, the hill and burned Bishop Ransom in, in effigy, you know, right there on the, on the tree right in front of his house.  So, I mean the, the, the turmoil and tumult happened right there, whether it being fired; the state supported him, and suddenly with the split you're talking about is that once the state would not give in and the church, the bishops insisted on following through with their dictatorial sort of demands of Wesley being ousted, which wasn't accepted by the students, the faculty, or the state.  That's the thing that set up what became and what is now two schools.  And that's what the state, Central State [College of Education and Industrial Arts at Wilberforce; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio] came out, and hey, two-thirds of the buildings and two-thirds, and two-thirds of the building and, and, and three-fourths of the money was the state's.  So all the state had to do was say okay, the ravine, the, the land you own is across the ravine.  Okay, you can, you can keep that, and we'll take all of what we already own, and then we'll expand it.  And what, what, what happened is Central State became the state school, Central State.  And Wilberforce kept its little segment, and, and eventually, you know, built upon it.  And I still get letters from the alumni at Wilberforce.  I mean I, I--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they, they built across the highway, across 42 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I mean I, I, since I--that was the last legitimate year when the school was toget- together, Wilberforce still claims, you know, you, me as alumni even though--and Central State, I never get anything from Central State, and I was only there a year.
Story_ID: 276543
Speaker 1: The best thing that happened to me besides the, the things I've already talked about as far as education, two things: I became, my drama interest got sparked, once again, for the wrong, for, for, for, for wrong reasons.  I really got involved with drama because, once again, I needed to find something to do because I couldn't play ball because I had gotten injured in, in running track in high school [Xavier University Preparatory School, New Orleans, Louisiana] and my knee hadn't heal, healed sufficiently enough to try out for the team.  So I needed some extracurricular activity to do, especially I'm stuck out there in the cornfield, (laughter) you know, with, with not much to do.  And I found out that the girls in the, in the drama group could stay out later than, than the curfew.  At that time, the freshmen had to be in by 6:00.  The, the, the, even the juniors and seniors had to be in by nine or ten or something.  I said no, so me and a buddy of mine in, in my dormitory (laughter), we said man, like, let's find, you know, a place here.  I said if we find out the girls in the drama group had, you know, could stay out long as they, they, they, they, they, they wanted to, and the drama group was very well situated at Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio], interestingly enough, because the sponsor behind the drama group and a fanatic theater person was guess, was guess what, the head of the athletic department, Mack [M.] Greene.  Mack Greene was I mean famous.  It was, it, this odd thing that here was the, the head of the whole athletic department and, and everything else was a fanatic theater person.  And he had been responsible for creating the Wilberforce Players.  They didn't have a, you know, a, a formal theater program.  So the Wilberforce Players was, was, was it as far as the theater activity, and Mack Greene was behind it.  So I mean they, you know, and Mack Greene was very powerful figure there.  And at that time when I was there, Leontyne Price was, was, was there.  In fact, the year I was there, I was in two productions.  In that year they didn't do any musicals, so I remember Lee- Leontyne to sew costumes 'cause there, there was nothing for her to do that particular year 'cause they weren't doing any musical ex--.  She used to sing that in, in, in the, you know, the school assemblies and all of that, but there was nothing for the theater group there, 'cause we, we did two plays.  And I was--and for some reason they, they, they, they cast me in both of the plays they were doing.  And I'm there because of the women.  I wasn't (laughter) going there for, for theater purposes.
Speaker 2: Now what plays did they do?
Speaker 1: One was--well, what was the, it was a play that originally had been done in, in, in England?  What, what was, what was the, the name of it?  Had a lighthouse, it took place in a lighthouse.  It'll might, it'll occur to me before I, I finish.  And the other one was, was some, a play that had, had originally been a thriller movie, '[A] Shot in the Dark' or something, something like that.  I forgot the, the name of it.  'Thunder Rock,' 'Thunder Rock,' 'Thunder Rock Island,' [sic. 'Thunder Rock'] I think, was the name of the, the first play.  And, and right away, I'm the youngest.  No, nobody knew it, but I was the youngest member of the company.  All of--let me see--yes, still, by the time I did that first play, yeah, I still, I'm still sixteen years old, 'cause I went, went to school when I was sixteen.  And I'm playing the oldest character in the play, (laughter) I mean 'Thunder Rock Island.'  And I'm playing the oldest man in the play.  And the next play, the thriller, I, I played my, I play my own age, at least, but (laughter) the other I'm playing the father.  I said well, didn't know it at the time that I set my course for being the, the resident old man of black theater (laughter) eventually, always playing characters older than myself.  But that was, that was, that was one of the main benefits of being there. And, and, and you know, I loved performing in the plays.  I still hadn't committed myself to any, any, any theater career.  I still was following my original ambition, that I wanted to become a sportswriter, you know, basically.
Story_ID: 276544
Speaker 1: The second benefit from being at Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] was the fact that with all of that turmoil, it was obvious that they were gonna take away the certification.  Wilberforce was part of the same academic grouping as, ironically, the Big Ten [Conference], [University of] Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].  And it was obvious that with all that turmoil that the one thing (unclear) was the accred- you know, whatever the--
Speaker 2: Of Northwest--North Central [Association of Colleges and Schools]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, North Central.  They're gonna lose that, and a lot of people, students just, just say well, you know, I can't continue to go here with them losing their, their, their certification or accreditation, whatever it was.  For me, it wasn't so much that, that reason.  It was like it, being part of the North Central thing, it, it, it allowed me to transfer.  It allowed me to transfer to the University of Michigan, you know, which, which, which, as I said earlier, would have been more difficult for me, being an out-of-state person.  But now that I'm, I'm transferring, I, in the, from the same conference, it allowed me the right to transfer.  And I was able to transfer to University of Michigan and get to--for my second year.
Speaker 2: So this is like 1947?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I'm, I'm headed for Michigan in my second year, you know.
Speaker 2: All right.  Now, what was University--now this is a huge (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: You're coming into a huge--
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm, I'm leaving--
Speaker 2: --campus now.
Speaker 1: --I'm going from, from a speck in the cornfield (laughter) to like a, to all of Ann Arbor [Michigan], 'cause actually, at that point, basically, University of Michigan was Ann Arbor, period, you know.  I mean the little town, there's an excuse for a town that surrounded it, but I mean it was mainly the, the whole city and campus.  And, and it was interest--'cause I, I, once I was accepted there, I really--it really was a place I shouldn't have, I, I shouldn't have, I shouldn't have gone to, except that it, it had always been my, my, almost a fantasy, and I had to go once I was accepted.  But I had no, I had no money; I had no money.  The money that my folks [Dorothy Short Ward and Roosevelt Ward, Sr.] had, had, had put up for me to go to my first year at Wilberforce, that was gone, you know, their whole life's saving from the war [World War II, WWII], you know, where they had may have been able to save enough to send me to school during the war despite the fact that I could have gone to other schools in the South for free.  They went along with my ambitions only because they (laughter), they also wanted to get me out of the Louisiana because they knew I was by that time getting too rebellious was gon' get in trouble with the, the white folks.  So they sort of (laughter), not happy, but they felt that it was a good thing for me to leave.  And, but by the second I got to Michigan, I, I really, really was destitute and, and used up whatever the, the remaining money basically to, to, to go there.  I didn't even have a, have a, have a room.  I just left on the train to go to Michigan without knowing where I was gonna stay or what have you.  I wound up staying on a, on, on a, on a back porch of a lady who sort of had a, a screen porch, and she--and it was wintertime.  She put up a boards, you know, and I sort slept on a couch there, a little cot, to be there (laughter).  I mean I wanted to be there so bad, and got there and, and immediately at least found out that what I was coming to the conclusion of as far as athletically, that I was not gonna be an All-American football player.  But I did get a chance to test myself.  And, and of course, I'm at the University of Michigan when they won the national championship.  I'm there with, with the great, one of the greatest football teams (laughter), in, in, in collegiate history, I mean with the great--I don't know whether you, you, you, you may be too young to remember the great--well, it should have been three All-American, but had two, it had two black All-Americans. [Len] Ford, Ford and, and, and, and, Bob--Mann [Bob Mann], Mann and Ford--Ford on, on defense, who played with the All, All-American at that All, All-Pro at, at, with the Detroit Lions; and Bobby Mann, who, who would have been All-Pro and in the hall of fame if he hadn't gotten hurt at Pittsburgh [sic.].  You know, he was, I think played for Pittsburgh a couple of years.  Then he got, got this--
Speaker 2: Who is the third?  You said Ford, Mann and--
Speaker 1: Gene Derricotte, who--
Speaker 2: Gene--
Speaker 1: --would have been the third one except that Michigan had, had, had promoted its white All-American; I mean Bob Chappuis.  They committed themselves to Chappuis, and Chappuis became All-American at running back, but Gene Derricotte was his backup.  And (laughter) everybody knew Gene Derricotte was, was even better than, than Bob Chappuis, but they couldn't (unclear).  They were doing very nice to have, like, these two (laughter), the two black All-Americans.  They couldn't (laughter), at, even at that time they couldn't, they couldn't have three.  But it was a great team because they had all these, all these, all--
Speaker 2: So were you on the team at that period?
Speaker 1: No, I was on--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I was on, I was on the, on their freshmen team, even though I, I came as a, transferred as a sophomore.  But I, I was basically on the, on the, the freshmen team, which was good enough for me to test myself because the freshmen team, well, had All-Americans who--dudes who would become All-American later (laughter), you know.
Story_ID: 276545
Speaker 1: More important than that I'm, besides my foot- giving up my football fantasies, that's the way I was, became politicized, radicalized more than--
Speaker 2: What, what radicalized you at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan]?
Speaker 1: I went to join a, a, an NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored Peoples] group, even though Michigan wasn't allowed to have any campus groups that were under the umbrella of a national organization.  So they called themselves something else.  I forgot what they called themselves but it was like an NAACP group.  And in that group, these nice, particularly this one nice older white dude came up and befriended me, you know, you know, and so forth.  At first I'm suspicious.  Why this little white, you know?  And you gotta remember, I'm fresh out of the South, even Ohio.  I mean I'm still in an all-black school, environment.  I'm still (laughter), you know, and as I said, fighting against discrimination in (laughter), in, in, in the movies.  So I'm still, I'm still southern.  I ain't got too much relationship or contact with white people except them nuns, you know, in, in high school [Xavier University Preparatory School, New Orleans, Louisiana].  And, but, but anyway, I mean I was a little suspicious at first, but he, but, but he turned out to be a decent dude.  And I, you know, didn't shy away from, you know, his, his, his friendship.  Besides, he had a beautiful wife (laughter), I mean, I mean, you know.  And anyway, gradually it turned out that he, you know, he, he, he, he was a left-wing radical, you know.  And some of the, you know, the ideas and stuff that he began to, you know, talk to me about and issues he talked about began to, you know, resonate, make sense.  And he began to introduce me to, to radical literature and one thing in particular.  Now, it sound like a cliche, but I mean (laughter) it was, it, for me it was real.  I mean I hadn't, I had never, I had never even heard of the name of Karl Marx.  I had never even heard the name, and suddenly he gave me this, this, the little slim pam- pamphlet.  And I, and I read it, and I said this, I said, "This motherfucker's talking about me."  This sound like me, you know (laughter).  Workers of the world throw, throw off your chains.  What, I said, "Wait, wait a minute.  This sounds (laughter), this sounds like he talking about me."  Anyway, that was, that was my intro, introduction to, to Marx and, and, and, and--you know, it wasn't it, and it wasn't like I came out of some intellectual thing.  I mean this, this, this was to me, this was like (laughter), you know, instinctive.  I mean, you know, what I read was like this, this is not, this, this is not intellectual.  This is, this is describing my plight, (laughter) you know, and stuff.  And gradually, I became interested and involved, and before you know (laughter), and before you know it, he and I were the two foremost radicals on the whole campus before I left that year (laughter).  So suddenly, besides being an All-American football player, I'm an All-American radical (laughter), you know.
Speaker 2: Now was he in, in, was he a member of any of the parties and stuff (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, yeah.  It turned out that he, you know, he was a member of the--and there, there was, you know, there was a campus, you know, whole group of campus people.  Fact, at that time there were some--later on, I mean people who, who, who, not in terms of politics, but became well-known in other, other fields, scientific fields and, and medical fields who were part of it.  But my thing, I'm still a kid, you know, and these are, all of these are people out of, out of--he, he was a veteran of the, the Second World War [World War II, WWII].  So he's already a man in his, in his, almost like--I think he, he, he--I know was he was in, in, in, in, beyond his, his, his, his mid-twenties.  He's already in his late-twenties almost.  And, and, and then I became, what I became in, later on in, in, in the left-wing movement, I became like a, a, a prodigy.  You know, I mean I was at that time seventeen, and even by the time I came to New York [New York] and became involved in the left-wing movement, I'm still nineteen, twenty years old.  And I'm, I'm of, (laughter) I'm the leader of thousands, you know, but I was a prodigy, I mean because of my intelligence, but also, you know, it was like, you couldn't find, (laughter) you couldn't find a better representative of the oppressed, I mean, and, and handsome at that and (laughter), and, and articulate at that, and, and authentic.  I mean, you're talking about the working class.  I'm authentic; I'm a peasant dash working class; I'm, I'm, I can talk; I'm (laughter), I'm, I'll take your little--that said, I'm, I'm also, you know, pretty good to look at and all that shit.  So I was (laughter) really, I was really like a, the, the perfect candidate for (laughter), you know, for left-wing charmer and all that shit, you know.
Story_ID: 276546
Speaker 1: You were at, at University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] for, did you stay for (unclear) (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I just stayed there a year.  By the time--
Speaker 1: What--
Speaker 2: --but, but the also, the other thing at the University of Michigan besides everything else.  Besides my radicalism was the library.  That's when I took a step up in terms of my exposure to world literature, let's put it and the great writers of, of international world literal, from [Leo] Tolstoy to, you know, [Fyodor] Dostoyevsky to the Russians to the, to all of the, you know, international classic writers, I mean the, the library basically.  It wasn't through formal education, is that I started going to the library and selecting what I wanted to, to do and read and so forth.  And eventually, that's the thing that, that sort of made me begin to, to orientate and gravitate towards creative writing rather than sports, the, the, the, the, the, the, the narrow parameters of becoming a sportswriter, I began saying well, I, I think I would like to do something, you know, creative.  But that was exposure to what I call world literature, which I continued once I got to New York [New York].  I used to haunt all of the, the used bookstores and 4th Avenue and so forth.
Speaker 1: Now, now how did you end up coming to New York from--
Speaker 2: Because--
Speaker 1: --from Ann Arbor [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: --when I became involved in the radical movement and suddenly and, and, and the library, I suddenly realized that what I wanted to do and my acka- my ultimate academic limitations would catch up with me.  See, I knew immediately once, once again at Michigan, right away it was different from Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] in that Michigan required you to take math and science along with the subjects that you didn't, that you liked.  And I knew right away. I said this is you know, this ain't gonna work, because now I'll be exposed.  Now when I start having to take maths and all, and science and all these other subjects that they require that I'm not interested in and not good at, that's not gon' work.  So I said I need, I need to educate myself in the narrow line about what I'm interested.  And the exposure to the library gave me the root that I knew that I, I, I had learned enough to educate myself in what I wanted to do.  And once I decided I wanted to be a creative writer, I knew that I had to read good literature and, and, and explore things independent of having to make grades and stuff, so that's when I decided to drop out.  And I knew that the combination of what I needed to learn on my own, that New York provided the best resources, combined with New York was the center of left-wing active- act- activi- activism.
Speaker 1: So did you know someplace, somebody here that you could stay with, and, and did you have any kind of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, only people I knew to stay with my last time was, was an aunt, my, my mother's, one of my mother's--
Speaker 1: Did your parents [Dorothy Short Ward and Roosevelt Ward, Sr.] want you to come--
Speaker 2: --sisters who had started the exodus of her brothers and sisters to New York, you know.
Speaker 1: Did your parents want you to come back to Louisiana, or did they--
Speaker 2: No, no--
Speaker 1: --they--
Speaker 2: --they never, they never--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --they were happy that (laughter) I was not in--there'd been enough ex- enough experiences in, in my youth and, and so forth to make them a little, little, little worried about me in an environment of the South, being prone to be outspoken as they knew I was.  You know, it wasn't I was being outspoken in any setting.  It's just that they knew the opinions I was expressing about things to them, they knew that to, for that to be expressed openly and outwardly at the surface, that that was sure to get me into, you know, in trouble.  And this is long before I mean there was any conscious radicalism.  It's just, you know, at that time just instinctive revolt against the place that racism and segregation had put black people in and especially young males and so forth.  That was dangerous, and they felt that hey, it's probably better not, for me not to be there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you went to New York in, was it, was it, was it still '47 [1947] or was that '48 [1948] when you went--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I came to New York in, in, in '48 [1948] by this time.  See, my, I started at Michigan in '47 [1947], therefore the following year was, was the dropout year.  And I immediately came to New York 'cause it was during the election year that--and all of the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that's when--
Speaker 2: --the Wallace campaign, which I got involved with--
Speaker 1: Henry [A.] Wallace.
Speaker 2: --even, even while I was still in Michigan.

Story_ID: 276548
Speaker 1: And you were just talking about Michigan State [sic.] because you, you--
Speaker 2: Michigan University, right.
Speaker 1: Michigan, University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].  Just and we'll sum that up as to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --how you get to New York [New York].
Speaker 2: Because--
Speaker 1: So, mention Julius again, Julian, Julius Franks [Jr.].
Speaker 2: Well, in 1942 Julius Franks I think was, was an All-American at, at, at, at Michigan, University of Michigan, and I think even captain of the team [sic.].  And that, that sort of inspired me as, as desirous of playing football and wanting to be (laughter) to match him, be an All-American, to go to Michigan.  I, I wanted to get out of the South.  I think I, I may have covered that (laughter) earlier, and so Michigan, Michigan and my interest in athletics.  And by this time I also had don't known that, you know, my writing interest, wanted to be a journalist.  I sort of wanted to, to sort of be a sports journalist.  And so a combination of my interest in athletics and, and, and journalism--'cause Michigan had a, a good journalism school--sort of inspired me to, to go there.  Now the irony about when I, when I wanted to go there, they weren't really accepting out-of-state students because it's right after the Second World War [World War II, WWII].  And all of the G.I.s were coming back, so the, the, the, the slots in the school were being reserved for all of the, you know, the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] veterans who were coming back.  In fact, all of the schools were inundated with these returning vet- veterans.  So, they didn't, they, they, they sort of put a, put a halt on out, out-of-state students.  So, I couldn't get into Michigan when I first applied because of that, and then I went to the Wilberforce University [Wilberforce, Ohio].  And, and, and, but Wilberforce was in the same ath- the same, not athletic but the same educational conference [North Central Association of Colleges and Schools].  And at the end of my freshman year I was able to transfer from Wilberforce to University of Michigan.  And finally, that was my, I was in my dream come true.  But the problem (laughter) was I did, I did join the freshmen team.  You know, I had no scholarship; you know, I was walk-on pretty much.  And, but I immediately found out that I was too young, much too young.  The competition that I was faced with was too much.  Michigan, Michigan won the, the, the year I was there it was 1947, '48 [1948], Michigan won the national championship.  That'll give you an idea (laughter) of, of the nature of the competition.  Most of the, half of the players or more than half of the players were, were, were, were, were veterans returning from the war twenty-two or twenty-three years old.  Here I was, just making seventeen, you know (laughter), just making seventeen years old, hadn't even full, fully physically developed.  And then my, my tools and skills were not on that level, so I mean and found out that my All-American football player's ambition was sort of (laughter) a pipe dream.  But, more important is that I, you know, in order, in order to find my way and find a, a social context and pe- people to relate to, I sort out what, what, what essentially was, was an NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] club on campus.  They didn't call it that because I think all the, the schools didn't allow, at least Michigan didn't allow national youth school organizations to have a national, to be attached to a national--
Speaker 1: Affiliation.
Speaker 2: --affiliation.  So you had to have another name for it, even though it was like, it would have been NAACP Youth Club [NAACP Youth Council] or something like that.  But anyway, in that club I, I, that's, that sort of led me to meeting people who, who, who then both educated me and I also found congenial.  And it turned out that they, they were radicals.  You know, they were--
Speaker 1: Who were some of those people?
Speaker 2: --not, not, not, the, the, the, the club was not radical but the individuals in the club.
Speaker 1: Who were some of those individuals?
Speaker 2: There was one individual who was very, very, very, very influential on me, was a returning veteran who was in grad school called I think Ernie Ellis [ph.] was his name.  And he, you know, he was a mature man, and, and I think by then at least mid to late-twenties, you know, so he was a mature man.  And here I'm seventeen year-old, still a seventeen year-old, a kid.  But he did is he introduced me to literature and stuff like that that I'd never heard of, you know.  And, and immediately I began to, to, you know, to get interested in the social analysis and so forth that basically, from, from the large of the Marxist per- perspective.  And soon (laughter), soon, giving up my foot- after football, the football season was over.  By that time I had sort of grav- gravitated towards politics more than athletics and so forth and then, then, then became a, a flaming campus radical, you know (laughter).
Story_ID: 276549
Speaker 1: And eventually what I found, a combination of fact that academically at [University of] Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], I was out of my depth in a, in a way.  And, and certain, in, in, in, in certain ways, at Wilberforce University [Wilberforce, Ohio] I'd been allowed to take all of the credit, all of the classes that I wanted to take.  And it was, it was sort of a system that, that they required you to take certain required subjects, but it was up to you when.  So I, by then, had realized that I was gonna be on the grad list, and I probably, at Wilberforce I probably was on the grad, grad list because I took all of the courses that I like and that eventually, even at Wilberforce, if I, if I got to my junior year and then had to take all of the, all of the things that they required before I graduated, I'd have flunked out.  But when I got to Michigan I already had--the, the Michigan system was different, and I had to take, take classes and subjects that I, not, both weren't interested in but also had not really, really prepared myself in even, even in, in high school.  I mean like math and science, I was never interested in math and science.  And, and while I got a very good, excellent education, a ground ABC education in, in, in, in my high school years at Xavier Prep [Xavier University Preparatory School, New Orleans, Louisiana] with the Sisters of [the] Blessed Sacrament, they, you know, the school just didn't have the equipment for A-class education in those subjects or at least inspired you to, you know, really do it on your own to a certain extent.  So by the time I got to a high developed school like University of Michigan and had to take advanced algebra, geometry, whatever--
Speaker 2: Trigonometry.
Speaker 1: --or trigonometry and--
Speaker 2: Chemistry--
Speaker 1: --the physics and--
Speaker 2: --chem lab and--
Speaker 1: --and, and all of that, that, that was it.  And I knew right away, I said no, this not, you know, this is gon' work.  And then, once again, all of the classes, journalism class, psychology class, all of the (laughter) things that were, that were congenial to me I was, you know, I excelled, but I wasn't interested--so what happened is, instead of concentrating on the subjects, I discovered and started cutting class and going to the library, and I discovered the library.  And between my, my tutoring from my radical friend, friends, and, and particularly Ernie [Ellis (ph.)], on one hand, which had nothing to do with, with, with formal, you know, the formal education and my discovery of, of literature in, in, in, through the library.  I mean the, the great masters of world literature.  And, and so then, I, I, I, you know, I began to, to concentrate, educating myself.  And what happened is, in the process of being exposed to, to world literature, gradually I began to, to lose my desire to be a sports journalist and more, more, more inclined toward something creative, creative writing.  I didn't know what, what genre, what form, what style, what, what, not style yet, yet.  I wasn't developed enough to talk about style but what, what genre I wanted to concentrate, because I, I was just reading basically the, the best of world literature.  And I knew I wanted to do something creative.  So my, my ambition to sort of be a, a sportswriter, you know, sort of, sort of was (laughter), vanished in a way.  Anyway, it, it, it just led me to the fact that I, I knew that I wasn't gonna, I wasn't gonna make it in, in, in academia and, but thankfully, what I wanted to do, I had learned enough in college, the two years in college, basically, to educate myself.  And that's why that led me to say okay.  I don't really need to struggle to get grades.  I don't need to struggle to (laughter), you know, to get a, a degree and so forth.  It'll been nice for my parents' [Dorothy Short Ward and Roosevelt Ward, Sr.] sake.  You know, it'd have been a feather in, in, in my cap in terms of their aspirations.  You know, I mean they were wonderful people, working-class people who, who a sheepskin represented, you know, not just a bourgeois dream for them, but it, it meant that, that, that the child had, had, had done something beyond what they were allowed to do, you know, in, in terms of their, you know, their world and their time and their place.  And you know, the degree would be something that you (laughter), you, you could show.  It would take a while before your creative ambitions were go, were gonna pay off.  I mean you could show a book or a play or something.  That was gonna take a long time, but at least at that age at that time, a, a sheepskin might have been nice for them, but I was not interested in it.  And I knew that it wasn't gonna work because I wasn't, I wasn't gonna, I wasn't gonna put the effort in, into getting it.  So that, all of these factors sort of led me to realize that, you know, I, I just will get out and, and proceed in my independent education.
Story_ID: 276550
Speaker 1: Did Ernie [Ellis (ph.)] help in the decision of you deciding to become a journalist and to leave school [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Not, not, not, no, no, not, not, not at all.  I mean in fact, it, it was totally mine; I mean it wasn't, wasn't any advice.  The only thing that Ernie, Ernie then introduced me to, to, to a world of, of intellectual and act- activism, which I was, as I said, I was born for.
Speaker 1: So when you talk--some of the things you were reading, you speak about world literature--
Speaker 2: Well, in, on one side--
Speaker 1: On one side, right, okay.
Speaker 2: On one side, I, on side I sit at the library.  I'm reading [Leo] Tolstoy; I'm reading [Fyodor] Dostoyevsky; I'm reading the great masters, you know, world, world, world novelists particularly, [Guy de] Maupassant, a whole, you know the whole, whole, whole international repertoire of, of genius, you know, writers, and, and particularly in a novel form, some short stories and so forth--on the other through early I'm reading radical literature.  I'm, I'm, I'm--
Speaker 1: And what is the radical literature?
Speaker 2: The first, the first thing I, the, the, the first thing I read that I thought that it was written for me, 'cause it describing me, was 'The Communist Manifesto' [Friedrich Engels and Karl Marx].  I think [Karl] Marx was nothing communist.  And I said look, the, the, this, I mean this, this is crazy.  I, you know, this dude is talking about, talking about me, not me personally but talking about my world, the background of the, you know, the, the, the, the environment, the oppression, the, and, and, and all of, all of those, those things and then all, also analyzing the reasons and all of that.  So it's like that, that, his, the (laughter), the, 'The Communist Manifesto,' which I've reread recently last year sometime during--two years ago I think was the hundredth or something--
Speaker 1: Anniversary.
Speaker 2: --anniversary of it, and I reread it.  I said oh, it still makes sense (laughter), Workers of the world unite.  I mean and so forth, and his, his, well, of course his description of, of the system still, still is, is, is, is valid.  You know, I'm not--his, his timing about the prophesy of when and where, that, hey, that, that may not have, have stood up, but, you know, prophesy is (laughter), that's not the most important thing.  Nobody can be a, predict you know, but, you know, his analysis of, of--
Story_ID: 276551
Speaker 1: Who were your influences?  Who, who did, like, you, you had Julius [Franks, Jr.] as a sports figure to look up to.  As a journalist, who did you have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And ironically, ironically, it was very interesting 'cause I finally met Julius Franks in my great admiration during the time I was, that year I was there.  And, and the interesting thing is that we had a fight in, in Ann Arbor [Michigan] to, to desegregate I think the barbershops or something like that.  And Jule, Jule, Julius Franks disappointed me 'cause he took, a, you know, he, he was trying to be, be safe in relation to his relation to the University [of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan] and so forth, took a sort of a--opposite position (laughter) from, from the rest of us who fighting, you know, picketing and so forth.  And, but it, but it, the most important person, individual out of Ernie [Ellis (ph.)] who, who influenced me in terms of the, the so- the social (unclear) the political thing was, was a man I met called Jim Jackson [James E. Jackson, Jr.].  And it turned out that Jim Jackson along with a couple of other young black youth or college, almost college age, had been responsible for organizing the tobacco workers in, in, in Virginia.  And Jim was, was a, was functionary, a communist functionary in Detroit [Michigan], and a remarkable man, and a remarkable intellect, and he's black.  I mean most (laughter), ma- most of the other people I'm, I'm, I'm dealing with, the radicals I was dealing with on campus, I mean they were not black, you know.  And suddenly--
Speaker 1: Ernie was not black?
Speaker 2: No, Ernie wasn't--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: --no, Ernie, there wasn't, look, there wasn't too many black (laughter), black people on campus except, other than the ath- the athletes, you know, there weren't too many (laughter), there weren't too many black, blacks on campus.  So there wasn't, you know, it wasn't, wasn't a particular environment.
Speaker 1: Sa--go ahead.  And, and, and I just want to talk briefly about the gentleman who organized the tobacco workers in Virginia.  What was his name again?
Speaker 2: Jim Jackson.
Speaker 1: Jim Jackson.  And he influenced you how?
Speaker 2: Oh, in, in, in--
Speaker 1: Just--
Speaker 2: --his, personally, his persona, his brilliance, intellectually, strategy.  I mean he, he, I mean he was a, he, he was a brilliant, masterful organizer.  And, and so I was, I was just impressed all around, both in terms of his skill and, and his, his, you know, his, his intellectual depth.

Speaker 1: So you realized you wanted to be a journalist.  New York City [New York, New York] seemed like the most (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, but by now, yeah--
Speaker 1: --common place to write.
Speaker 2: --by now, right, by now, as I, as I said earlier, the journalist ambition, since it was linked to the sports thing, it sort of, it's--
Speaker 1: Waning.  You're not--
Speaker 2: --waning, yes--
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: --in, in, in, in that way, and I'm more interested now in, in, in seeing what, what, what I will do in the creative field.  So it, I wasn't, it wasn't linked in--
Speaker 1: And when you say creative fields what do you, what do you mean?  You, you--
Speaker 2: I'm ordered the right books or something, you know.
Speaker 1: To address--
Speaker 2: No, to express myself creatively.  You know, of course, I would assume that at that age my urge to be creative was gonna be to, to express myself and express the world that I came out of in some form or another.  But you, but, but, but I think what, what, what, what you, what, what, what could be, what could be connected to what I've already talked about is that my reading, see, I'd already, as, as, as I've said earlier, I'd already read everything in, in, in existence that I could get my hand on, including at, as I, as I said earlier, including at the age of, of ten and eleven I'm reading 'Black Boy' [Richard Wright] and Richard Wright.  I'm reading, reading 'Studs Lonigan' [James T. Farrell].  So I'm, in order, in wanting to be a creative writer, I already had models of writers who, who wrote both, you know, both, both, both, both black writers and socially-oriented writers.  So, when I decided that I wanted to write creatively, I already had, had, had a wealth of models, both close and both, as I said, internationally.
Speaker 1: So what year do you arrive in New York City?
Speaker 2: In '48 [1948], '48 [1948] I arrived in New York.  And when I say sort of out, from New Orleans [Louisiana], what happened is, at the end of the year, in '48 [1948], you gotta remember, '48 [1948] was also the, the election year for the [Henry A.] Wallace campaign that I, you know, the Progressive movement became very much involved in, in, in, in the Wallace campaign.  And before I left Ann Arbor [Michigan] and, and I--when I left Ann Arbor, I went to Detroit [Michigan] and work for about six, seven weeks in Detroit before, after I dropped out at the end of the, you know, dropped out, and, and then I participated in, in the, the, the youth campaign, the Progressive Party youth campaign for, for Henry Wallace.  And that's where I first heard Paul Robeson, you at, he was rallying in Detroit.  And then I had made up my mind I, that I was going to New York, that New York had everything that, that I needed to continue my education by educating myself.  I naively even thought that I had found a non-accredited university to (laughter), to go, which is, which is Jefferson School of Social Science [New York, New York], at, you know, at which was a wonderful, a wonderful place.  And I didn't know that at that time I, all I knew about was when you talk about schools other than, you know, secondary, and high school, and, and college, all I knew that, that, you know, college, they were colleges.  So I just assumed that it was like the college, but it was radicals off to college.  You know, it was, and it was.  It was a workers, basically it was a workers' school, night, you know, workers.  It wasn't a, (laughter) wasn't a regular college you went through.  I'm only laughing because eventually when I did go there, I became legendary because I signed up for courses just like I was going to regular school.  I signed up for, for eight courses I guess to get, to get credits (laughter), I mean.  And so I was going every night, taking two, two courses each night, and I sort of took one on Friday just to give myself some relief, you know, from, from, from my studies.  And that was, that was unheard of.  Most people went there, you know, once a week for (laughter) one, one particular course.  Here I'm there signing up like I'm going to a regular cur- you know curriculum-type thing.  But it was wonderful because, you know, the time I did, I took a lot of good courses from good people.
Story_ID: 276553
Speaker 1: But that, I'm, I'm sort of jumping ahead because when I, when I went to Detroit [Michigan] after dropping out of [University of] Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], worked in the Progressive Party camp.  And then before, before I was going to New York [New York], I'd already decided I was going to New York.  I was going, just going back home for a month.  And I did go home in between going to New York, and then I made a juvenile and stupid mistake.  But a contradictory of being the radical that I was, it was a, it, the contradiction was that I was really obeying the system in a sense that I, you, when you made eighteen you're supposed to register for the draft.  And since I had made eighteen while just before leaving, I think, Detroit.  I think I made eighteen, and since I was in New Orleans [Louisiana], I obediently went and (laughter) registered for the draft.  I'm only saying a stupid mistake because I should have waited and registered in New York, since that's where I was gonna stay.  But I made the mistake and registered in, in New Orleans, thinking that registered for the draft meant that, that your draft, you, you, you could transfer, you know, that you, wherever you registered didn't matter; you could trans- you registered in New Orleans, you, you transfer it to New York.  I didn't know that when you register for the draft they own you.  Wherever, who, wherever you register they will own you for life.  That will always--when they call you up (laughter), you know, to go into, to the [U.S.] Army or, or something like that, they will, that board, they will not let New York have you.  They will cont- no matter whether you la, no matter where you're living.  So anyway, that eventually was the thing that, that really got me in trouble.
Speaker 2: How so?  Because you--
Speaker 1: Oh, eventually, eventually--
Speaker 2: --you were caught--
Speaker 1: --it, it led to, it led to them using my so-called not, not being available for being drafted was the claim that I was avade, evading the draft.  And that, and, and, and, and by that, but, but, but that--
Speaker 2: But by having gone to New York, they considered that you evading the--
Speaker 1: No, no, no.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: By the, by the time I got in trouble, it had nothing to do with those facts.  It had more to do with what I had become in terms of my political activity.  So it wasn't, it was, it, it was just an--what I'm saying it was, they used that factor and put it together and used it as an excuse to punish me in a way.  And, and my mistake was if I had waited and, and registered in New York, they wouldn't have had that, that scenario.  They couldn't have played out the particular scenario that they ultimately did in when they finally wanted to, to get me off the, the streets of (laughter), of New York and so forth.  But anyway, that, that was, that, that came later.
Story_ID: 276554
Speaker 1: Where we were is I was just getting to New York [New York].
Speaker 2: To New York.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And arriving in New York, having heard Paul Robeson speak, and coming--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --out of working for the Progressives, what did you do for a living arriving in New York?
Speaker 1: Well, when I first got to New York, I mean which ironically I got to New York and, and really (laughter) didn't have enough money to, for cab fare to get all the way up to Harlem [New York, New York] where my aunt lived.  And when I got to 125th Street, the cabdriver--I told him look, I, I, I, I see where you are right now, and that's all the money I got.  He was nice enough to drive me the twenty-five, twenty more blocks to 149th Street and 7th [Avenue; Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. Boulevard].  But anyway (laughter), I came here stone broke and so with, with only my aunt (laughter), my aunt's place.  I have no work basically when I got there.  I had no idea what I was gonna do to make a living.  You know, all I knew that when I got here I would find some sort of job to, you know, to, to take care of myself.  But I was more interested in, in--at that point, I arrived in New York in May, June, July; it was somewhere in June, July, somewhere in September--close to the election.  So therefore I got to New York, and, and, and, and, and the election campaign was, was, was at its peak.  So immediately I was able to get involved in, in, in, in the election campaign through the Progressive youth section.  I immediately became involved and in that and didn't really have any, any, any, any work for a while.  But, you know, I was able to--you know, my aunt was (laughter)--you know, I was able to eat, and you know, I found a place like right in the same block with, with my aunt that was, you know, the, not rooming, it's not a rooming house, a lady who had a--
Speaker 2: A room in her house, yes.
Speaker 1: --extra room, right, a room in her house, right, (laughter), which became, became my life for, for many years after that.  But anyway, I became involved in, in, in the Progressive campaign and, and ultimately, that's where I wound up meeting, meeting Lorraine [Hansberry], 'cause Lorraine had, Lorraine arrived I think maybe--I think I might have gotten here first.  But not too long after I got here, Lorraine Hansberry came from Chicago [Illinois].  I mean she did the same.  She dropped out of University of Wisconsin [University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin] and all, almost the same (laughter), the same, same ingredients and pattern.  I mean she, you know, had become interested in writing and so forth and dropped out of school to do it on her own, you know.  Anyway, she had been radicalized also while she was there.
Story_ID: 276555
Speaker 1: We were just talking about the excitement of the 1948 [Henry A.] Wallace (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, the--
Speaker 1: --campaign.
Speaker 2: --the, that, that campaign, as I said, you know, it was the excitement of, of, of this third-party campaign I mean which had, had energized and, a whole segment, crucial segment of the country.  And as I said, we really thought it wasn't just a third-party campaign, which is usually like okay, this is just a, a protest campaign, and we'll make a little, little stir.  We'll keep, we present the issues and so forth, and, and that, that we will, we will achieve, you know, making an impact of some kind.  At that point, no, the Wallace campaign, at, at first we really thought that was a, that was a strong chance, that he could either win or that he could do so strong till it would cement a third party as a, as an alternative as, as a strong alternative in American politics.  Even if he didn't win, we thought that the campaign would, would end up with, with, with, with making a third party a permanent strong part of American political life.  So with all, with that great optimism and all of the energy that, that was put into it and all of the excitement and, and, and so forth that, that it generated.  It came somewhat as a shock that he didn't do, you know, as well as expected.  But on analysis, and some people, by, by the time the election came on, already realized this, but, you know, for the masses of people involved, it still came as a shock because, you know, the optimism and, and feeling that, that it could happen still carried over, even though in looking back at it, it was obvious that certain things had began to happen that was gonna prevent it.  And essentially, what, what, I mean not to get into a big heavy thing about it, but essentially, just to sum it up to a certain extent, Wallace's campaign forced [President Harry S.] Truman to almost usurp and adopt important planks of his, of, of, of his, his program, you know, that, that, that he was, his initiative and he was unique about.  And the force and the threat from Wallace and then from Truman, though he was being threatened from the, from the Dixiecrat side.  But he smartly, and his advisors smartly took, took many of, of, of, of Wallace's platform and, and ran with it.  And once, and once that happened, it, it just, you know, it, it, it died, diminished the need on, on the electorate for a Wallace.  When they saw that, that--
Speaker 1: Truman was--
Speaker 2: --Truman with a traditional mainstream Democratic Party, people were pragmatic.  They thought that it (laughter), it probably could happen better, you know, like--and, and one of the, one of the important planks that I'm talking about, we were all of the civil rights elements.
Story_ID: 276556
Speaker 1: But this is pre-civil rights, before the term civil rights, before they actually coined the phrase civil rights.
Speaker 2: Oh, shit, man, look, civil rights (laughter), there's no, there's no pre, there's no pre-civil rights period in the sense the black folk you know, black folks have been fighting for civil rights (laughter) I mean for, forever but particularly in, in modern times, God, the, the, the '30s [1930s], I mean all the, all the, all the, all of the great, the great struggles during the '30s [1930s] and in the then, then, then the '40s [1940s], which led to the war [World War II, WWII] led to, to even a greater thrust because of being able to embarrass America about its contradiction of, of fighting for freedom, for freedoms across seas and then--so anyway, so there was, for, for, for black people in particular, you know, this was just a, just as continuation of the struggle.  The fact that they had a, a presidential campa- candidate who embraced the causes, I mean that, that was, that was wonderful; that was new in, in a way and made things more possible.  But, and couple of, about a year and a half ago I was, I was doing something else or looking for something else, but it caused me to go back to my hometown in New Orleans [Louisiana] and, and, and, and, and read the, about three, three years of the black weekly there, The Louisiana Weekly.  And even though I was looking for something else, I got enamored with, with looking, looking at the whole paper in the headlines and the editorial.  And what, what I'm describing to you, I saw it in the editorials that The Louisiana Weekly was, was strongly behind [Henry A.] Wallace.  And then when [President Harry S.] Truman came up, usurped his civil rights platform and programs and so forth, The Louisiana Weekly even editorial that almost apologized for the fact that it will buy Truman and, and, and, and, and all apologetically give Wallace credit for stimulating and causing, forcing Truman to do it.  But being pragmatic about it, they felt that, you know, as in American politics that, that if Truman was going to carry it out, it stood a better chance than, than from, from a, from a--
Speaker 1: Third party.
Speaker 2: --from, from a third-party candidate.  So anyway, that, that was a very strong reason the usurpation of, of, of much of the planks in Wallace's campaign led to the diminished need on the part of the electorate to vote for Wallace.  You know, they, they saw a possibility that they could get to, they could get it through the mainstream candidate, Truman.  And to this day, I mean to a certain extent, it's not, it's never been, been, it's not, not, not been treated exhaustively in giving credit.  I mean a lot of people give credit to Truman for civil rights policies and so forth that he really didn't give a fuck about (laughter); you know, he really didn't give a fuck until pushed and realized that, that, that, that he needed to get elected.  And, and he wasn't gonna, you know, he wasn't gonna get the Dixiecrat vote on that side, so he'd better get the liberal, so-called liberal and, and, and, and whatever the black vote was at that time, and it worked; you know, it worked.
Speaker 1: So, he, the, so the party, the third party had succeeded to some degree--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --in bringing your issues to the main (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh absolutely--
Story_ID: 276557
Speaker 1: What did it do for you, for the Progressives as individuals, for you--
Speaker 2: It, it, oh it--
Speaker 1: --and Lorraine Hansberry?  What did you guys do with that momentum afterwards?
Speaker 2: Oh no, no, this, we, we just became more, I mean we, we already, Lorraine and I were already radicalized progressive, even with the Progressive Party.  You, you know, the, the, the, let's say the Progressive Party represented a left liberal spectrum in American politics.  We were left.  We weren't, we weren't liberals; we were left already.  This, you know, so the Progressive Party, you know, was a vehicle for achieving many of our ambition and goals.  But that was not the, the, the, you know, that was not the end all of our view.  We were social.  We by, Lorraine and I, by this time, we were radicalized and we were socialists.  You know, we, we, we weren't, I mean, you know, we weren't liberals.  So once this--I said the great disappointment of, of the deflation of [Henry A.] Wallace's not doing as well didn't really affect us that much once we got over the early, you know--
Speaker 1: Disappointment--
Speaker 2: --disappointment of it, because we were already radicalized beyond that.  I mean we our ideas were already, we, we knew had, had, had, had a long term--ha- there was no way, there was no way that America was gonna become socialist overnight.  So, to a certain extent, we were, we were chagrined that, that a candidate like Wallace didn't win.  We were, we were happy that even when he didn't win, he had forced the mainstream party and brought the issues into the center of American politics.  So for the--all of our efforts had been, resulted in positively.  Individually, we, especially at our age, we, we were still in the, in the process of developing our ideas about what we had just linked ourselves to.  I mean, you know, that's eighteen years old, I mean shit, we, we might've become let's say socialists, but we didn't know, we really didn't know too much about it.  So when I say about our education, we were still in, in formation.  And eventually, of course, as, as you, you might know, as we after that, the Progressive Party, we, we, I, I then--and, and Lorraine was, was, was a member--I then participated in founding the, the Labor Youth League 'round I think '49 [1949].
Story_ID: 276558
Speaker 1: I also became, was becoming known as a Marxist youth leader in Harlem [New York, New York], because I was head of the, you know, the, the Harlem clubs.  And that's where both the combination of my political activity, my best friend was a dude by the name of Roosevelt Jackson, who became Lorraine's [Lorraine Hansberry] fiancee.  And when we were (laughter), when we were, when we were living together, I always, I always claim, I don't know, I don't know what Lorraine's biography or, is gonna say or what have you, but I always claim that, that Lorraine was probably deflowered, ha, in our bed.  'Cause, you know, we live in Harlem and, and what you'd described earlier, a, a room in a (laughter) house.  And you know, we had one big room and, and so forth.  I think the bathroom was out in the hallway, you know, one of that sort of thing and one big bed, and used to alternate.  When he had company I would go to the movies or something and you know, wait to get home and vice versa, when, when I had something he we, you know, we had the, we had to alternate and not being around long enough for to do our business.  So, (laughter) I would say that I think Lorraine might have been de- deflowered in that, that common bed that we had.  But anyway, I mean it, it's, in fact, I'm talking about Lorraine's biographer just, you know, just, just had, had sent me a picture to, to, for me to verify out of Lorraine's archive, a picture that, that Lorraine had of, of, of my best friend Rosie Jackson.  And it was, it turned out it was.  And, and the irony about it, it's a picture of him on, on, on a soapbox, on a ladder in Harlem in a soapbox speech.  And I, and that one person next to him--and then there's a, the, the, the shoulder of somebody and I think it might have been (laughter) me, you know, just the shoulder of the third person in the picture.  But Rose, Rosie was, was, you know, supposed to, they were supposed to be engaged, but that, that, that was a, a miss (laughter), mismatch.  But anyway, Lorraine and I continued our, our radical education by even, by 19, 1949 I think I also went as a delegate to the [Second] World Youth Congress in, in, in [Budapest] Hungary, you know.  And I'm saying I'm becoming known publicly as (laughter), as a radical youth leader and, and, and I think even, even, even our participating in that congress, I think one of, one of the, the mainstream weekly papers at that time, The Saturday Evening Post, wrote a major article saying how we, you know, the, the communists were, were manipulating the American delegation.  And then, and then that made me the (laughter)--at nineteen years old (laughter) (unclear) made me the pra- the primary manipulator.  I said boy, that was some, that was giving me a little too much credit for, (laughter) at that age and stage and so forth.  And I, I, ironically that did, that, that trip to Hungary did lead, lead me to, to do my first published writing, 'cause I wrote a, a pamphlet, ultimately, based--
Speaker 2: Now what--go ahead.
Speaker 1: --base, based on that trip.  And I think a pamphlet called 'Toward Bright Tomorrows[: World Youth Unites for Peace and Freedom,' Roosevelt Ward], which was basically a description of my experiences on that, that delegation and, and the whole thing.  And the irony about it is that I still, I have, have to go the Tamiment Library [The Tamiment Library & Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives, New York, New York] at NYU [New York University, New York, New York], see whether somebody has it, 'cause I, 'cause for some reason I've lost my copy of it, so I gotta find a copy of it (laughter), you know, 'Toward Bright Tomorrows,' which, which was published when I was twenty years old.
Story_ID: 276559
Speaker 1: So you spoke about being in Harlem [New York, New York] and, you know.  Can you just give me a sense of, of the com- what the community of Harlem was like at the time you were a part of the Progressive Party (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, the, Harlem was Harlem.  I mean Harlem was, was this vibrant, vital, you know, the capital of the black world, the black world at that point, with all, all of the energy, I mean all of this.  So it wasn't just a question of politics.  It was like, for me, living in Harlem was the total life of it.  I mean I became a, a barfly forever, for life.  I mean I (laughter) became, I--you know, like most people spend time in church.  I spent (laughter), I spent more, I spent as much time in bars as, as most people spent, regular people spent in churches.
Speaker 1: Was the Lenox Lounge [New York, New York] popular back then?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, Lenox Lounge; in fact, the Lenox Lounge not only personal (laughter) to me is, Lenox Lounge is really personal to me because that was a period my, my first soon to be marriage that did, that didn't happen, you know, was played out almost at the Lenox Lounge.  That was a favorite spot for, for me and, and my, my fiancee at that point.  It was, it was a different type of lounge then.  It wasn't so much if--like now I haven't been up there recently.  It wasn't a live thing.  It was, the thing about it, it had a great jukebox, always had a great jukebox.  But it just, just was a Harlem hangout I mean and so forth.  Just like I, I tell people, except for and throughout my life until my later, into my thirties, the only time I was not in Harlem was if I was working outside.  I mean there was nothing I, there was nothing out, there was nothing outside; they had nothing for me.  Everything that I was interested in, in was in Harlem because there was a vital, vibrant life.  I mean when you talk, when I'm talking about the bars, I mean you got five bars on, on every you know, 7th [Avenue; Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. Boulevard] and Lenox [Avenue; Malcolm X Boulevard] and all of those main thoroughfares.  You got four or five (laughter) bars in the same block.  And it was a whole culture of, of nightlife and, and, and all the, all of the, all of these things, even when people talking about the great jazz period of 52nd.  52nd Street wasn't--that was a tourist place.  I mean that's not where the music was, was incubated.  I mean they played there, but you know, like, black musicians always had the, have to work where they can make some money.  But basically the, they played uptown, I mean, as you know, at, at, at Minton's [Playhouse, New York, New York].  That's where they really in, incubated the moo- and then the younger breed who--I'm talking about the younger breed, Jackie McLean just died I think about four or five months ago.  Jackie was of that second, that, that second group of alto players, little younger than Bird [Charlie Parker] and so forth.  But they all played up and down 125th Street.  I mean you go on Saturday, you go to dances all over hundred, you know, 125th Street.  So, Harlem was vital and vibrant in every way and in a lot of ways even more so because it, blacks' participation in other areas of the city was not, you know, was not welcome, to a certain extent.  I mean what, what eventually became black Broadway when, during the period when, when, when the so-called black exploitation movie period, when, when Times Square [New York, New York] sort of became on, on Saturdays, Friday and Saturdays and became like black Broadway.  But that, during my youth, no.  We didn't, we never went to movies or downtown or anything.  You had movie houses that were, were in Harlem.  So you had, you had a, you had a, a, a self-contained community in a total way.
Story_ID: 276560
Speaker 1: Far as activity go, it was the one place where radical viewpoints were totally normal.  And right, we used to battle, we used to have the battle of the orators, talking about my friend Rosie Jackson [Roosevelt Jackson] (laughter) on the soapbox.  I mean we used to, we, we used to be regular on the weekend on, on soapboxes.  And, and, and I would be on one corner, and like, Malcolm X or somebody (laughter) would be, you know, would be on the opposite corner.  And, and many times, you were, you were bat- you, you were battling ideas (laughter) from your soapbox, and they counteracting you (laughter) from theirs.  It but and the Harlem [New York, New York] audience was receptive.  You gotta remember, historically Harlem had after--let me see, before I get, get it historically mixed up, but Harlem, during the latter '30s [1930s] and so forth and into the time, in '48 [1948] when I came there, Harlem was still represented by, by Ben Davis [Benjamin Davis, Jr.].  Ben Davis was, was, was a councilman from Harlem; city councilman from Harlem was Ben Davis.  Ben Davis was the leader of the Communist Party.  I mean, and, and even, even after he got indicted and (laughter) convicted and being sent away to jail, they were still vote (laughter), they were still voting for him, you know.  So what I'm talking about there is that you weren't out of place.  And we used to feel sorry for white comrades, to a certain extent, that what they had to deal with, get, getting up on a soap block in--soapbox in certain places.  I mean Jesus, they would have taken their life (laughter), you know, and risking their lives almost, while we in Harlem we get up the people, "Yes, you're right" and so forth.  I mean it's almost like, like the black community has always been there.  They always have been practical and pragmatic, but everybody knew that they never, there was never any, any isolation or exclusion of, of their radical voice I mean.  And you know, the whole history of Paul Robeson's trouble, the black, black community never, never backed off of Paul, you know.  They, they knew that it was dangerous (laughter), you know, that, say associate with him in a particular way.  But, hey, Paul was always welcome in, in, in the black community, and there was never any, anything like that.  And that's why it, it was so disturbing and shocking, the time when, when, for that moment when the Un-American Committee [House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC)] used Jackie [Robinson], you know, to, to, to put Paul Robeson down after that so-called speech that he made in Paris [France].  And, and they--even something that I think, one of the main things that Jackie regretted later on in life, that the one thing that he did was, was, you know, made him seem like an Uncle Tom.  We were very angry with him; not, not just us radicals, but the whole community was, you know, pretty angry at, at, at Jackie allowing himself to be used like that.
Speaker 2: What year did that happen?
Speaker 1: Fifty-one [1951], '52 [1952] [sic. 1949].  It's somewhere around, 'cause I remember the, the speech.  The speech was around '50 [1950]--it's, it's, it's between '49 [1949] and '52 [1952], somewhere in, in that period.  I forgot what the particular year.
Speaker 2: When you traveled to Hungary--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --did, did this happen before or after that trip?
Speaker 1: Oh, this was before.
Speaker 2: This was before.
Speaker 1: Yeah, this--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --as I said, I went to Hungary in '49 [1949].  That speech, that speech, the, the speech took place before--after the thing with, with Paul.  Because what happened is, is the Cold War then began heated up, and it was the whole thing of the Peace Movement, as, as he said.  And Paul made a speech at the height of that period of the development of the Peace Movement, as it was called.
Story_ID: 276561
Speaker 1: But anyway, the getting back to what you're saying, by the time Lorraine [Hansberry] and I, Lorraine eventually worked on Paul's [Paul Robeson] paper, and ultimately, when I got arrested, another thing that (laughter), that I've lost, Lorraine did a major interview with, with me that appeared in Paul's paper, Freedom that she, and she conducted that interview me and a wonderful tape that I've lost.
Speaker 2: What year were you arrested?
Speaker 1: In '50 [1950] '51 [1951], '51 [1951]--
Speaker 2: Fifty-one [sic. 1949].
Speaker 1: --when I made twenty-one.  I said I registered in at eighteen.  I came to New York [New York], you know, became this flaming radical youth, ha, youth leader, help found Labor Youth League, went to, to Hungary right after the, I think the Labor Youth League was founded too and, and, and so forth, and then came back, wrote the--
Speaker 2: 'Toward Bright Tomorrows[: World Youth Unites for Peace and Freedom,' Roosevelt Ward]
Speaker 1: --the, the pam- yeah, 'Toward Bright Tomorrows' and once again, resumed my leadership in Harlem [New York, New York].  And while I was, you know, ultimately, I became like second in command of the Labor Youth League in, in New York State, and that's just around the time when, when I was, I was arrested.  I mean I'd been working in Harlem, and then I was elevated to, to a top position and became second in command of the Labor Youth League in New York State, and that's, that's around the time that I got busted.
Speaker 2: What did you get busted for?
Speaker 1: For so-called evading the draft.  And what I talked about earlier is that what had, what, what had happened was not me evading the draft.  It's just in coming to New York, I was moving around.  I mean, as I said, I was, I'd lived in ten different places.  So, who, you know, at 17 or 18 (laughter), who's gonna keep up with, with, with your correspondence from wherever?  So what happened is a couple of times they would send things to my parents.  They would, they would send it to me late or something.  So I'm, you know, I didn't, and I, I wa- I wasn't, I wasn't consciously thinking about anything.  It's just that I wasn't aware of all of the correspondence I was getting from the draft board, because it had to come from New Orleans [Louisiana] and through all of these and, and, and get to me after I'd moved from various places.  And it's not like every time I move in two weeks I'm going to send you, send the draft board an address.  So in many instances, they, they, they couldn't find me.  And ultimately, they realized, ultimately, after I became publicly known for my outspokenness at this time about certain issues, particular now you gotta remember the Korean War is the big issue, just like the Vietnam War.  And I was on record being opposed to our participation in the Korean War.  So that, all of these things led to them saying oh God, we gotta get--and now also, you gotta remember there are not too many youthful black radicals, you know, articulating these, the, like I was at that time.  So, for the government that--you know, you stood out even more so.  There was very few of us, and, and we stood out even more, and therefore we, but we also were more dangerous because they felt that, the--you know, they're always afraid of the impact that radicals will have on their own people.  That's why they were so frightened with Paul.  I mean they knew that, that you had a, a voice, you know, an ear, particularly in the black community.  You know, it wasn't like you could say that in some instances the right radicals, except in certain segments of the labor movement, had a hard time, you know, because the people they were talking to was, were so, you know, so chained to, to (laughter), to belief in, in the system till they were almost, you know, they were all, the, that their own, their own people listening to 'em would, would be angry at 'em for expressing radical views.  But that wasn't true with the black masses or black community.  So we, black radicals, always were like even more dangerous, and therefore, our views on certain things took on greater, you know greater threat.
Story_ID: 276562
Speaker 1: Once I came back, and I got arrested in, in '51 [sic. 1949], as I said because the shit had hit the fan in relation to the, the establishment fear, you know, of opposition to its policy, particularly now with the Korean War.  But the irony about it: the last place in the world that they wanted me was the [U.S.] Army.  This was the contradiction.  That's why (laughter) you know, I mean it's such a wonderful irony of life.  And that's certainly the last place in the world they, they wanted me would be in the Army, but they wanted to silence me.
Speaker 2: They wanted you off the streets.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they wanted me off the street.  So, suddenly bam, somebody came up with the idea well, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, we, we, we found a way and somebody in Washington [D.C.] a particular--we found a way.  And then, then all of this whole thing about, about evading the draft, like, I was totally unaware of, of anything like--and then one morning I went to the office right on 799 Broad, Broadway, was right there on, on, on 10th [Street], 11th Street [New York, New York], you know, right there on Broad.  And that morning I walk in, and these two dudes walked in and bam (laughter), you know, you, you're arrested and so forth; took me to the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] headquarters and, and, and the next thing, I'm in jail, you know.  And I immediately got out I think a couple of days in jail and got out on bond.  And then the hearing was set and so forth.  And then we tried to fight extradition and so forth.  We knew that, that, legally that wasn't, you know, wasn't gonna work because legally all you do with extradition all, it's a paper thing.  They say they send the right papers, and the, the people receive 'em, so send you.  There's no argument about it.  Anyway, then I was taken in chains (laughter).  I was taken in chains to--
Speaker 2: Back to the South?
Speaker 1: Yeah, back to New Orleans [Louisiana] on the train with, with two federal marshals, you know, and so forth; arrive in New Orleans almost at midnight and so forth; and ironically rode a, a red--a, a yellow cab for the first time, because at that time the cabs were still (laughter) segregated.  So, but the marshal, shit, they were white.  They got a prison.  They--so I said oh, this is somethin'.  I'm in a yellow cab for the first time--desegregated the yellow cab (laughter) and took to the [Orleans] Parish Prison [New Orleans, Louisiana], that thing that in the hurricane you read about, that the shit that happened around that Parish Prison.  I was in there.  I was in that prison, same prison, and eventually, eventually got out on, on bail, and the trial was set for, I think the trial happened sometime in, in, in that, that year, twenty, twenty, twenty-one, '51 [1951], I think maybe in September.  Anyway, I was con- convicted and sentenced to three years in jail.  Now during the whole trial the pretension was it's all about, you know, all about the facts.  It's nothing to do with policy.  But soon (laughter) after they convicted me, the, the, the whole, the whole thing came out that, that they should set a major bo- bail because I was, I (laughter), I was too, I was too much of a threat.  So, I was aware, which, which, even I had to laugh at that point.  It wasn't a laughing matter, but I said wait a minute.  They finally exposed the real issue behind it--
Story_ID: 276563
Speaker 1: Luckily, of the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] men who arrested me and, and, and, and appeared, and, and, and testified at the trial, to this day, it was one who was trying to be, you know, trying to be ideologically propagandistic about the whole thing.  But there was one who was very matter, stuck to the facts about the case, and I always remember and think about this, and I probably owe him a debt even though he was just doing his job like, you know, like he thought he's supposed to.  And he--but it was ultimately, my feeling is that the case was thrown out by the [U.S.] Supreme Court after two years of, of appeals of the conviction.  And I think that one of the things that caused, probably caused it to be thrown out because in this FBI dude's testimony, I mean he told the facts just like they were, and, and the facts were so, so ridiculous in a way.  They're, the irony of the big, biggest fact, they arrested me at my LYL [Labor Youth League] office.  Now the whole claim of--now you gotta remember, the whole claim (laughter) about the case is that I'm, that I'm evading the draft.  It turns out that on whatever my, my, my latest communication with, with the draft board, it's on 799 Broadway [New York, New York] (laughter) is, is on there, my com- you know, what I said where I was.  So, you know, I think the Supreme Court finally looked at it and said well, it, this, how, you know, this can't, this can't wash.  How are you gonna claim the man is evading the draft when you go and arrest him at the place, the address that he gave you (laughter)?  So anyway, I think that pro- that fact probably fell through the, the Supreme Court without any opinion.  They never, they, you know, they just threw it out without any, all, you know, unanimous decision, thrown out without an opinion.  So I don't know what facts did it, but, but in my own mind I think that was, the logic of it.  Now, the reason why I got convicted, they took it to the South, and they, they had an all-white jury except for one lady who was black, and she was intimidated.  So, you know, they could, they knew they could get a conviction.  I tried after getting out.  I spent about three months in jail waiting after I was convicted to get out ultimately on bail, and then I tried to come back to New York [New York].  And they allowed, the, the, the people allowed me to come back to New York, but they didn't put it, we didn't have it in writing.  So as soon as I got back to New York, three or four days after I got back to New York, and somebody in Washington [D.C.] found out that I was back in New York, they gave (laughter) the Louisiana people hell, say we did all, went to all this trouble to try and get him (laughter) out of New York, and you let him come back and--so anyway, my lawyer called and said look, the people, the D.A. [district attorney] here, federal D.A., he he's, gonna claim that, that he didn't give you permission, even though he did, but since it wasn't in writing, but if you get back, if you get back within the next twenty-four hours, we'll forget about the whole thing.  That's what happened is that immediately had to get back to New Orleans [Louisiana], and then I spent the next year and a half restricted to New Orleans, waiting for the appeals to go through.  And then finally the Supreme Court threw it out after, at the end.  It was a sort of mixed feeling of get, of that, that, that moment of when I found out that I was exonerated because it happened the same decision that was given about exonerating me was the, was the last appeal [in Rosenberg v. United States, 1953] that the Rosenbergs [Ethel Rosenberg and Julius Rosenberg] would turn down.  So I mean it's almost like the, the, the final thing that said that the Rosenbergs was gonna get executed (laughter).  So, I couldn't be too elated about my own freedom, even though I felt, you know, felt wonderful that I didn't have to spend the three years in jail, but, and for my folks [Dorothy Short Ward and Roosevelt Ward, Sr.] who had, you know, been under great stress during, during that period.
Story_ID: 276564
Speaker 1: Anyway, after that I did, once I was exonerated to come back to, to New York [New York], by that time, I'd sort of got, gotten comfortable live (laughter), living a life back in my hometown [New Orleans, Louisiana], you know, being a wastrel and haunting the pool halls and, and doing, you know, all of the things that were far away from political activity.  And I had--so, I remember that, that they were gonna welcome me back to New York at a big rally that I think wasn't for me, but it was a rally that Paul Robeson was gonna be speaking at or something.  And it turned out I couldn't get back that soon.  It was just too quick, so Lorraine [Hansberry], Lorraine represented me at that rally and explained why I wasn't there.  And then ultimately, a couple of, couple of, one month later I did come to New York, and once again arrived in New York on the day of another rally that I remember taking a cab from the train and going right to 156th Street, where, where, where the rally was held, while it was in progress and showed up.
Story_ID: 276565
Speaker 1: --Back in New York [New York].  I resume my political activity.  But now I'm sort of caught in between, because in my two years in New Orleans [Louisiana], even though I, you know, didn't, couldn't find any jobs, you know, just friends and so forth moving.  I had a friend who had a father was a, moved, you know, moving business I used to go and, and, and, and things like that, but I never could find any work.  I was (laughter)--nobody was gonna hire me.  I mean I was a flaming red [communist], you know, in the South, you know, in a place like--so anyway, when I, when I got back, I had, in the time to, to spend the time there and try to, to ward off the thoughts about possibly spending the three years in jail, I'd, I then sat down and wrote my first play.  And that was a play that not only I wrote but helped to stimulate Lorraine [Hansberry] and Lonne Elder [III], author of 'Ceremonies in Dark Old Men,' who had become a third member of our, of, of the, our trio of, of am--write, writing ambition, with writing ambition.  Lonne had come from Jersey City [New Jersey].  Lorraine, of course, had come from, from Chicago [Illinois].  And when I came back, and I came with this, this magnum opus, this four-act play, you know, and the three of us read the play in a public evening at, at the Hotel Theresa [New York, New York], a room in the Hotel Theresa.  Not too, too many people in the audience, but the three of us read the play, and (laughter) it was like, it was like Lorraine and Lonne be so impressed with, with my effort (laughter) of writing this, this four, you know, this, this four, four-act play that sort of cemented their desire to now concentrate on becoming playwrights themselves.  'Cause up until time Lorraine and you know, and Lonne, Lonne was basically doing more poetry than anything; Lorraine was sort of testing herself in, in various ways, various creative and journalistic genres but hadn't totally committed to, to playwriting yet.  But after I wrote this play, they said well, I, I can write, I can write one too.  And of course, you know, the rest is history, because I mean, out of--eventually Lorraine came up with '[A] Raisin [in the Sun,' Lorraine Hansberry] and Lonne later on came up with 'Ceremonies.'  But that was the start of my final literary--
Speaker 2: What year was that?
Speaker 1: --effort.  This, this, this was like '53 [1953].
Speaker 2: And what was the time of that first play that you came back with--
Speaker 1: 'The Trial of Willie McGee' [Roosevelt Ward, Jr.] the trial of Willie McGee.  Willie McGee had been an international sa- no celebrity, international--call, called celebrity because he was, he was a black man who was accused of rape in Mississippi and ultimately executed, you know, in, in, in Mississippi electric chair.  But it became a, a international issue and cause at that time, and I wrote a play, you know, about him and, and the whole situation there.  But my commitment to become a playwright had started much earlier, as I was the leader of the, the clubs in Harlem [New York, New York].  And as I've said in often interviews, it was like my being not too pleased with the, the, the dogmatic and the dull, boring nature of, of, of these, these political club meetings that I wanted, (laughter) I wanted to liven things up, so I started writing skits, satirical skits about what was going on the world and events and people and so forth.  And I, I began to do this to liven up the meetings.  So, and that sort of cemented me in terms of saying okay, the impact of just reading and doing whatever I was writing at these, at these meetings sort of then, then oriented me to, to, to concentrate on wanting to become a playwright. So by the time I was arrested and, and, and, and concentrated on my first play, 'The Trials of Willie McGee' I mean I already was committed to being, you know, being a playwright.
Story_ID: 276566
Speaker 1: Ultimately, that involvement and writing the play and the play, once I got back to New York [New York] we performed scenes from the play at, at one big, large public, public rally.  I had also for, I also forgotten how--as I said, I wrote, I wrote 'Toward Bright Tomorrows[: World Youth Unites for Peace and Freedom,' Roosevelt Ward] when I was nineteen.  I also, just before I got a, yeah, just before I got arrested I, I remember also, because of the, my writing for the, for the clubs, I also had written a thirty-minute what I call cantata based on Nat Turner's life called 'Star of Liberty' [Roosevelt Ward] that the club members got together.  The what, whatever the club that I was, one of the clubs that I was in charge of got the people together.  They were not actors.  They were not (laughter) anything but we got together, made 'em become a chorus behind me doing the narration of, of, of the, the cantata on Nat Turner's, in, the incident in Nat Turner's life.  And then we had a wonderful musician accompanist who was at the time Paul Robeson's accompanist, Alan Booth, who took these nonprofessional, non-singers and then, then, then had 'em, behind me in my narration basically doing gospel and spirituals and so forth.  And that had been done at a rally just before I got arrested.  So I mean I, by now, I'm, I've got these experience with the skits, the, the 'Star of Liberty,' the Nat Turner piece, and then I come back from the South with, with this, this huge play, 'The Trial of Willie McGee' [Roosevelt Ward, Jr.] that we then performed at, at the Hotel Theresa [New York, New York].  And, and then we performed scenes of it at a, at another rally.  The thing, the interesting thing in my writer's development about that piece is that it also, I also then read it, became at the, at the Harlem Writers Guild, which at that time was, was, was, was functioning very, very, very strongly under the, the guidance of John Oliver Killens.  The problem, when I read the play to the Writers Guild, is that their response--not their, 'cause it wasn't everybody, just whoever was, was, was commenting on it, listened to it at that meeting at the time when I read it.  But I, I, I realized that they really didn't know enough about playwriting to be of any help to me.  And on the other hand, the negative thing about it is that they didn't know about playwright.  But there were enough people making comments about the play that made me think that they were commenting about the wrong thing, in that they were, they were upset about what I consider to be, and what to they probably still remains, some of the best elements of the whole piece that still stands up as a beginning effort.  The more, the scenes that, that, that, that I had written of the common people in bars and talking in their conversations, their, their, their daily conversations.  And at the Writers Guild they all got upset that, that the language I was using, 'cause I was using, you know, the curse words and the nigger and all that shit.  And they were all, what later on became, called political correctness, they were at that time I, I can backdate it and say that they were more interested in that sort of thing.  And I and my instincts, which, which, which turned out to be correct 'cause I knew that this wasn't, this wasn't helpful.  They couldn't help me too much technically because they didn't know, know enough about, about playwriting except for Alice Childress.  And content-wise, something told me that, that, that this correctness wasn't right, you know, that this was gonna, the, this gonna, that this was gonna stymie me as a writer, you know.  And as I've, now I've taught writers, later on in life I've taught writers they don't wanna, it's hard enough to write a sentence.  Please don't think about what not to do.  You can't write from a negative.  I say you can't sit down there and say suddenly a sense of yourself and say oh, I gotta make, I, I gotta do this, and this gotta be correct.  That, that, I said that's, that's, that's the most, most, you know, intimidating, restrictive thing to do in relation to write.  I mean let a writer what, what, what he or she wants and comment about it, you know, later and, and so forth.  But, but, but, but to, to, to plant these ideas about I gotta, what I gotta be correcting what I say is, is, you know, is, is, is not, is not right.  And that caused me to not publicly, but I sort of realized that my participating in the Harlem Writers, Writers Guild was, became like sort of nil, even though as time went on, I did become (laughter) famous to a certain extent.  You know, I, I didn't bother when they claimed me.  But I don't (laughter), I don't, I don't remind him what I'm telling you now that I almost say I quit because you all couldn't (laughter), you all couldn't do shit to help, help me.  And not only that, but you even, you know, you're the one that wanted to censor me.
Story_ID: 276567
Speaker 1: And the interesting thing is in my--I faced that with them [members of the Harlem Writers Guild], and then I faced the same thing with my political comrades, you know, for the same reasons.  And the interesting thing about that is that they would, they were criticizing my, the scenes that they saw from the play ['The Trial of Willie McGee,' Roosevelt Ward, Jr.] at this rally.  They, they criti- they were criticizing me at the same time that I was the main, I was the main witness at one of these, these, these senate hearing committees.  You know, (laughter) so once I started defending the LYL [Labor Youth League] at the, at the committee and then, and then going to face my (laughter) comrades latching into me about, about how, you know, how offensive elements of my play were, which caused me to not politically to change my feeling, but, but personally I, I tuned them out too, you know.  So, my instincts were even were, were good, even when, when I didn't quite know how to, ha, how to explain my reasons.  But I, I'm glad I had good instincts because I didn't, I didn't allow that to stymie me or stifle, stifle in terms of my, my, my writing.  The next irony is, is that when I came back to New York [New York], I was not interested in being a political leader anymore, you know.  And I felt guilty about it because there were so few upfront, well-versed, articulate young people to do, to be a leader in this arena.  But I, I knew then that I, I wanted to concentrate on my, on my writing.  And I finally, feeling guilty about it, I went and, and asked.  Like, I remember going and talking with, with Ben Davis [Benjamin Davis, Jr.] about it.  And, and he basically said look, hey, you can contribute better doing what you want to do in whatever way you want to do.  You can do it better as a writer than to try to be a, a political spokesman, when you don't wanna.  And that sort of gave me the, you know--oh, I didn't have to feel guilty about it.
Story_ID: 276568
Speaker 1: Then ironically, I got--talking about making a living, 'cause I'm, I'm still not making much of a living--then I got a job on the Daily Worker as eventually, at first a cover reporter.  So I'm back to journalism even after I've given it up.  I'm back to my original ambition about journalism when I, when, when I wasn't even expecting or thinking about it.  And not too long after I got over my apprentice period, I'm work on, working on the sports desk.  And the great editor, at that time the paper was of course, always in financial trouble, so they didn't have that much of a staff.  But the editor who was running the, the paper by himself pretty much was a great, great, you know, great sports editor and, and had been involved in, in the whole struggle, get Jackie Robinson in breaking the barrier of, you know, the baseball thing, which, which the Daily Worker had been very much involved in along with the, the black newspaper [Baltimore Afro-American; Afro-American Newspapers], the, the one out of Baltimore [Maryland].  The, those, they, they had been the leading people trying to break the, the, the segregation in baseball.  And so I worked under Lester Rodney was his name.  He was an excellent journalist and, and writer and, and so forth.  And then he decided that he was gon', he was gonna move to the coast.  So, you know, on, on, on, on the Daily Worker, I mean the sports, I mean they, they loved to have the page devoted to sports, but they never, it, it wasn't a priority.  So it wasn't like they're gonna--he, he was leaving, so to go out and do a talent search to get somebody to replace him.  Since I was working under him, automatically (laughter) the page was mine, mine to write thousand-word column every day for five days a week and to edit the whole page from the (laughter), you know, from the news ticket.  And, and, and, and the layout, I mean the, the, the heads, the sub- (laughter) I had a whole page.  Anybody, the tabloid, anybody knows about journalism, that (laughter) by myself and, and not, and, and, and, and a very cursory thing from the, from the desk in terms of the copy edit, edit.  So I got a damn near could've, you know, get all of this by 3:00 and so forth.  Half of the time, I mean when I finally left the paper, I had to write a, a farewell column asking the audience to please, the readers to please excuse me for all the typos and all of the missed this and that, that, because I had to do this by myself.  But it was a great experience, great experience because it did it was a great, great, it taught me a lot in relation to my own, particular my, particular playwriting.  And it, as it turned out, this along with, at the same time I made a decision that in order to write plays I needed to know about acting, actors, and I went to study acting.
Speaker 2: With whom?
Speaker 1: Paul Mann, Paul Mann Actor's Workshop.  I wasn't studying acting for a writer.  I was studying acting, so I mean it (laughter) wasn't--so I, you know.  But between my apparent--my, my work on the the Daily Worker and then 'bout the same time I was, I was studying acting.  Those two things, to a certain extent, really were great, you know, great, great teaching; educated me a lot in terms of my on-the-job experience in relation to my own self-development as a writer.  The wonderful thing about sports writing is that it's active, you know.  I mean you express it; you know, you know, you can't, you don't, don't just hit a homerun; you blast it, (laughter) you know.  So it, it has a very common, commonality with the urgency and the, the stress and, and, and the emphasis of a, of a dramatist, you know.  I mean a dramatist is always dealing with, as I, as I always tell when I teach it, writing, teaching, acting, I said look, you, you, it's all--there's an urgency.  There's no moment in theater or drama, which is not urgent, you know, and that's the same way in terms of, of writing sports; I mean (laughter) everything is urgent and, and you know, expressive of ultimate expression, not you know, so that, and then my, my, my gaining the craft, knowing what the craft of, of acting, it saved me a lot of time in terms of, as a writer, because I can write a play, and I can write for the actors just knowing (laughter), you know, in the writing.  I can write for the actors in knowing what they, they need to do and how they need to, to say it and so forth because I do it myself, you know.  But those two things were, were like very, very, very crucial in terms of my, my, my development.
Story_ID: 276569
Speaker 1: The mid-'50s [1950s], while I'm on the paper, I'm now running the sports page by myself, writing the, you know, column every day and, and, and studying acting.  And, and ultimately, I wound up studying acting for three years.  The three years, in that three-year period, I'm talking about the two things happened that caused an upheaval that in a, in radical life I'm saying, getting to the death of [Joseph] Stalin and the follow-up, the Czechoslovak Spring [Prague Spring], the, the Hungarian Revolt and so forth.  All of this, these two things in the, in the radical left, in the party in particular, began to cause rethinking.  Now, not only did it cause rethinking, but there on the paper, the Daily Worker, on the paper, we were lucky that one of the communist leaders would then, in prison had been, had served his time and came back, and they assigned him to be, like, in charge of the paper, editor, you know, publisher of the paper, like on record.  Turn--we were lucky that it was Johnny Gates.  Johnny Gates was one of the youngest of the, of the Communist Eleven.  But also he'd been in jail for four or five years.  And what happened is he came out and he was more malleable in terms of his own, you know, his own point of view and, and so forth.  And what happened is he allowed us, those on the paper who were there when he got there, he allowed us to then take the paper and turn it into a forum, an open forum, letters.  So suddenly the paper, after we got past the you know the news of the day and, and, and, and my, and my sports page, but the, the bulk of the paper were letters to the pa- paper on the response of the readers to the at--you know, to, to, to [Nikita] Khrushchev revelation, you know, at the 20th Congress [of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union].  And, and that suddenly was a earth, earthquake that ultimately would destroy the, the Communist Party in particular of that, you know, of that time.  By that, by that time, that earthquake the Communist Party never could, never recovered from that.  Now, the thing about it on the paper, the officialdom who were behind supporting the paper, suddenly withdrew their support.  So we, all of us, knew that, that we had a shelf life; I mean we're not gonna last.  And unfortunately, one of the, there, there were some wonderful ironies about it, 'cause unfortunately one of the people who were put in charge of, of trying to control us was my early (laughter), my er- my early hero, Jim Jackson [James E. Jackson, Jr.].
Speaker 2: Jim Jackson.
Speaker 1: Jim Jackson was put in charge, which (unclear) you know, I still love Jim and to this day.  I mean that period is, you know, over with and with nobody talks of it.  But, but, 'cause I still today--he must be in his nineties or something like now, but, and I still love him and respect him.  But at that (laughter) moment, I mean he was loud like I was.  A censurer or what have you.
Story_ID: 276570
Speaker 1: But by that time, I also, in, in my own personal way, was getting more, moving more--the, the best thing for me is that and what I was talking about with him [American Communist Party official, James E. Jackson, Jr.], thankfully I was young enough.  See, I'm, I'm still only, when all this shit is happening, I'm still in my mid-twenties.  So it was a wonderful thing is that I was never, as I said, instinctively I was never a dogmatist anyway, just by instinct.  Therefore, I, you know, I feel guilty about a lot of shit because I knew I wasn't right.  I wasn't thinking necessarily right.  But now I was free in the sense that no, there was no, there was no reason.  I had to find my own way.  I had to define my own viewpoints and so forth, what I, what I, what I believe in and so forth.  Now, the thing about it is the core values.  You know, I, I realized that I, I, I, the core value is what I believe in, was remain.  But the conduits, the conduits for it, the (laughter) party [Communist Party], the, you know the long--all of these things were, were now, no, that, that, that, that, that, that sort of--there would never for me be any, any group or institutional organization that for me would ever interest me in controlling my involvement, my thoughts, or anything like that, you know.  And it was going over and realizing what was blinkered and what you know, where the, the, the writers who, who have been persona non grata.  And so I say okay let me do this.  You know, I--he, he, he was an enemy.  Now let me find out what he was talking about.  I began to investigate all of the, all of the philosophical currents of existential, existentialism, et cetera, et cetera.  So, it, to me it was a great, great moment of freedom.  And I was young enough, so I had not been quote scarred or you know ingrained, stuck in, in cement in my (unclear). Unfortunately, for many of the older people.  There are some who I still admired as, as, as wonderful people and so forth.  But they had put in, they had invested so much of their, their lives in belonging to a particular formation like, quote the party till they--it was like they couldn't, they couldn't, they had to stick with it, even, even when they knew that it was not, what it should be.  I mean people like Ben Davis [Benjamin Davis, Jr.] and, and especially the, the, you know, some of the black leaders like Ben Davis and Henry, Henry Winston and Jim Jackson.  And some of the, and some, some, some of these people, they were not, were not all on the same level with me in terms of, of their intellectual depth or their, you know, their sometime personal qualities.  But it was, it was, it was, it was sad for me to see, to a certain extent, that, that I knew many of 'em knew better.  They were too--Ben Davis and like Jim Jackson, they were too smart.  So when they remained with what was now a straw (laughter) figure of, of, of what was, what was supposed to be a vibrant radical party or movement, you know, was sad; it was sad.  And, but personally for me it was, it was, it was freeing.  And since I was no longer interested anyway in following through in, as I said, being a political leader and so forth, my orientation began to more orient myself totally towards aesthetic, my aesthetic interests.

Speaker 1: And in this instance, it meant writing and, and, and, and--
Speaker 2: And theater--
Speaker 1: --and acting and theater--
Speaker 2: --and acting.
Speaker 1: --you know.
Speaker 2: And did your first acting excursion come?  When did your first acting excursion come?
Speaker 1: Actually, the my first professional acting thing came in, in '[The] Iceman Cometh' [Eugene O'Neill] in nine--the, the production of, legendary production of 'Iceman Cometh' with, at Circle in the Square [Theatre, New York, New York], which was already running when I went into it.  What happened is my classmate and, and, and friend, Philip Meister, at Paul Mann [Actor's Workshop] was stage manager of 'Iceman Cometh.'  And Robert Earl Jones, who died two days ago, Robert Earl Jones was playing Joe Mott, the, the black character in, in 'Iceman Cometh.'  And I used to go by, you know, visit with Phil, but I still hadn't committed myself to being a professional actor.  I still said look, I, I did that to help my writing.  But, after three years, I mean I was aware of the fact that anybody--that I was pretty good as an actor.  Forget about the writing.  I was a good actor, but I still wasn't, you know.  But after, after the, I left the paper [Daily Worker], I said well, I gotta find something to make a living.  And just when Phil offered me at that point he said, "Look, I need, I need an understudy for, for Robert Earl.  You know, five dollars, you know, if you can use five dollars," 'cause it was, you know, nonunion.  I wasn't-use five dollars, it's yours.  Even though you're not the age of the character or anything like that, but hey, it's an understudy.  You know, you may not even have to do it.  So I said, "Okay, I'll be the understudy," so I accepted the understudy thing.  But what happened is Robert Earl had another job, his own personal job cleaning Off-Broadway theaters.  And he'd shoot--he, he, he used to try to continue doing that while he was still in 'Iceman.'  And it made him so exhausted till the play--he, the character, Joe Mott, leaves in the middle of the, the, the, the third act when the play still has forty-five more minutes to go.  So he lived right close to the theater, so he, he thought that in the forty-five minutes (laughter) he could go home and take a nap.  A lot of time he didn't come back.  And so what happened is Phil began say Doug [HistoryMaker Doulas Turner Ward], I need you to, I need you to be, be at the theater, 'cause I don't know whether Robert Earl's gonna (laughter), gonna finish this show each night.  So anyway, make a long story short, I, we be, Phil and I began to protect his job because a couple of times he didn't come.  I have to go on for the last act, the fourth act.  And then, after that, and nothing happened to him, he then started missing performance.  So I was playing this, I was playing the, the role almost (laughter) more than Robert was.  Ted Mann [Theodore Mann], the producer, eventually found out that Robert was missing these performances and ultimately fired him.  And Phil then came to me and said Doug, it's your, your part.  You know, you've been playing it anyway.  If you want it, it's yours full time.  I said but I still, you know, I was only doing this part, you know.  He said well--I said look, and I'm not gon', I'm not gon' let Ted use me, since he found out that I'd been playing the role and all of this, and nothing (laughter), you know, not, everything was the same in terms of the play in the audience.  I said I'm not gonna let him use me just to get rid of Robert.  And then Phil said no, it's not, had nothing to do with you.  He is gonna fire Robert anyway, whether you take it or whether--he's gonna fire Robert, so it's not if you don't take it, he'll keep Robert, no.  He said no, he gon' fire him, so it's up to you.  And I finally said okay, I'll do it.  And that started my everyday acting career.
Story_ID: 276572
Speaker 1: Turned out that, that Jose Quintero, who had directed the production but hadn't, you know, had, you know, after, when I joined the show, show had been on about a, maybe a year already.  And by that time, Jose wasn't coming back to see it every night, you know; he hadn't seen it in months.  He just happened to come back just before it was ready to close, and he saw me do it.  It turned out that he was doing a production of 'Lost in the Stars' at City Center [Theater, New York, New York].  And 'Lost in the Stars' had three non-singing roles in it for the three young hoodlums, thugs, who robbed the, the family and causes the whole shit.  So, he saw me in it and perfect.  (Laughter) He had one of, one of the thugs for, for 'Lost in the Stars,' Robert, the guy from, [Godfrey] Cambridge, and Lou Gossett [HistoryMaker Louis Cameron Gossett, Jr.] were the other two.  The three of us were in 'Lost in the Stars' at City Center.  I got a second job while I was at cir--while I was doing, doing--before I, I took the job full time at, at, at, at, at, at '[The] Iceman [Cometh,' Eugene O'Neill], lost-'[A] Land Beyond the River,' Loften Mitchell's play, was running off-Broadway.  And they needed somebody to cover it since I--and, and since the time element between that show and, and, and, and 'Iceman' was so different in a way, I was, I started understudying that show (laughter) while I was also understudying that.  Anyway, so I'm already doing--I've got three shows, you know, when the other, other non- other act, other black actors who dream to be just actors can't even get a job.  And he'll be still talking about I'm a writer not an actor, and I'm getting more work than, than they did.  And ultimately, that led to my participation in all at that point.
Story_ID: 276573
Speaker 1: Finally, I got a call one day, Lorraine [Hansberry] was living in the Village [Greenwich Village, New York, New York] herself now.  And she then wanted to talk to me, and I went by her old school.  We lost contact for a number of years once she moved to the Village and, and, and I, I, I'd always remained in Harlem [New York, New York].  And since, you know, we weren't actively being involved politically in act, political activity together directly, and I didn't hang out with circles that she did, and I didn't go to the summer camp, you know, Camp Unity--
Speaker 2: And she was no longer seeing the gentleman who had been your roommate and--
Speaker 1: Oh no, no.
Speaker 2: Oh no, no, no, okay.
Speaker 1: No, that, that, that, that--
Speaker 2: Reggie, what was his name?
Speaker 1: Rosie--
Speaker 2: Rosie, okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Rosie Jackson [Roosevelt Jackson].  Now that, that, she had the misfortunate or the, the bad luck to have to tell me while I was still in New Orleans [Louisiana].  During the time I was in New Orleans she had to, she wrote me a letter saying she have--they didn't tell me, but that same room that he and I shared when I got busted, he still kept the room, and I left all my stuff there.  And she called to tell me that all my stuff had been put out on the street, the books, all the books I had amassed during my early years that he had.  He'd become a junkie and went, you know--she told me he you know, didn't pay, pay whatever the, the rent and so forth.  And, and they just threw her, put all her stuff out on the street.  And she, she fine, she finally lost touch with him.  And I ultimately saw him many years later on the street in Harlem one time.  And then finally we met, and he had a wife and so forth.  I met with him then, and he, you know, it was sad.  But--
Speaker 2: But she caused you to come to the Village, Lorraine does.
Speaker 1: Well, she, she, she was living in the Village.  I was working, of course, on 'Iceman' ['The Iceman Cometh,' Eugene O'Neill].  'Iceman' was right there at Sheridan Square [New York, New York] in the Village.  So I mean I was--and the Daily Worker office is on 13th Street right off Bro- right off of Broadway itself.  So I mean I'd been by, by this time working downtown for a while.  And, and then Sheridan Square, I was working in, in, in the Village.  But the show, what--she was living in the Village.  By this time she's married to Robert, Robert Nemiroff, who had been a long time from the Progressive Youth days.  He, he married somebody else, and that didn't work out.  And then, then, then Rosie didn't work out for her.  So I would say they finally, the two of 'em, got together.  I said oh, that's lucky.  Both of 'em, you know, on the rebound from bad, you know, (laughter) bad relations.  And they, so they deserve each other (laughter), you know.  So, but anyway, she was married.  She and Robert were living in the Village.  And she called me, and then she told me: "Look, I have this play that's gonna be done, and I just wanna, you know, just want to assure you in, in advance, since you've become an actor, that you get a chance to read for it."  And she told me, you know, about it.  And she already knew that, that as far as probably the role that I would most right for in the play ['A Raisin in the Sun,' Lorraine Hansberry] would, would be the one that was already taken, which was Sidney [Poitier], Sidney's part.  But anyway, she said I just want to assure you, you know, that, that you know, you'll bet, you'll get a chance to read for it.  Now, it turns out that reading for the role, that, that the play was also being directed by [HistoryMaker] Lloyd Richards, who'd been one of my teachers at Paul Mann [Actor's Workshop].  So, you know, I was in good shape in terms of, of, of that.  But in both instances it was like they would, you know, I would get a chance to read.  They weren't offering me a job or saying they would (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Put in a good word.
Speaker 1: Put in a good word or nothing--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you were--
Speaker 1: --like no.  They just wanted it--
Speaker 2: --you were given the opportunity to--
Speaker 1: --I, I would have opportunity as a friend; just make sure she had opportunity to read.  And then she and I got off on a, you know, like we all had by then.  Even in our early day, she and I would always say her, her thing with Rosie was always like, odd, because everybody who saw us relate to each other always assumed that (laughter) Lorraine and I were the perfect pair.  But just, the very reasoning that the people make like that is just the opposite.  It's because of we were so much alike, we were just the last (laughter) people who deserved to be together in a way 'cause we (unclear).  And, and, and Rosie was just, in a way, the opposite of me.  Rosie didn't give a fuck about--he, Rosie was, was, was an old Harlem slickster, you know, who could talk a good deal.  He was, he was beautiful physically, and, and, and he very--like on the soapbox, he could talk his ass off.  But half of the time I used to say, "Rosie talking all that shit.  I don't, I don't think he knows what he's saying (laughter), you know."  But anyway, and she was looking at that point in her early youth, she was looking for the, the idea working class, you know, the black working class.  So she was idealizing, and Rosie made sure of that.  Rosie was more interested in her material shit that she gave up--he went, he went to Chicago [Illinois] and, and was raving about driving around in, in her old man's [Carl Augustus Hansberry] Cadillac or something, you know.  More and she, and she, you know, had already given up those material values of the black bourgeoisie, and suddenly he loved that shit, you know.  But anyway, she, ultimately she and Bob got together, and, and she showed me in, got me a reading--
Story_ID: 276574
Speaker 1: Ultimately (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What came out of the reading?  What came out of the audition [for 'A Raisin in the Sun,' Lorraine Hansberry]?
Speaker 1: The audition?  I, I got, I got the job as Sidney's [Sidney Poitier] understudy, you know.  And, and also Lonne [Elder III] got the job in the small role of Bobo, which, you know, would have been--I also understudied Bobo, but I really was hired to understudy Sidney, 'cause basically the role of Bo, the small role of Bobo is there's no contrast between Sidney and I more for that role, while Lonne and Sidney's physically and every other way was a contrast.  And it was a good role for Lonne in, in, in the way that Lonne had, once again, being influenced by what happened to me, become an actor.  But he shouldn't have because he (laughter), he was good enough for playing Bobo, but Lonne was no actor either, you know.  And, and as I've said in a couple of instances, what I've written about Lorraine [Hansberry], I said I'm glad that the reading of my play in 'The Trials of Willie McGee' [sic. 'The Trial of Willie McGee,' Roosevelt Ward] back when we were twenty-one, twenty-two years old, I'm glad that, that, she read it; the three of us read it, but I'm glad it influenced her not to become an actress, because she wasn't an actress either (laughter).  Anyway, I got the role as, as Walt, Walter Lee's [Walter Lee Younger], Sidney's understudy.
Speaker 2: Did you ever go on?
Speaker 1: I, I played it for a year on the road, the road company.  I've played--understudied him throughout the Broadway run, never got a chance to go on.  And even when he left just three months or so before it closed, they, they hired--they didn't hire me to take over the role.  They hired Ossie, [HistoryMaker] Ossie Davis, which was not-Ossie a great act- actor, but that, that role wasn't right for him.  I was, as far as my, objectively, I was still too young for the--the only drawback for me was I was still too young for the role, in my mind.  To me, Walter, Walter Lee is, is, is ideally about to cross thirties into or close to forty because the whole thing about my last chance is somebody who, who really is on his last leg in relation to hope.  You know, that gives it, brings it closer to being tragic.
Story_ID: 276575
Speaker 1: Why do you think that play ['A Raisin in the Sun,' Lorraine Hansberry] resonated so much with audiences (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It--
Speaker 1: --across the board?
Speaker 2: Well, it resonated a, and I studied it while I'm--when I studied, not academic.  I studied by being in it and being there every night.  And I, since I was playing in one of the moving men, I didn't have to go on stage until the end of the play, moving man, you know, me the two understudies, the male understudies that, that we had to double and go on as a moving--so I was there every night.  I could go out and observe the audience, and so learned a lot in terms of studying that play.  And then I, as I said, I did on the road, so I did it in a wider more, more, more diverse context than anybody.
Speaker 1: Out of New York City [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Out of New York, all (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Across the, yeah, yeah--
Speaker 2: --across the country.
Speaker 1: --the country, yeah--
Speaker 2: I saw--
Speaker 1: --yeah.
Speaker 2: --I, I was able to, to sort and, and feel the response to it and, and (unclear) and, and I could write an essay about it.  But it resonated across the board in different ways, some of which were wonderful in making it popular, but for the wrong reasons.  Like for instance, just to give you an I, ideal: It just so happened that the original thing, that that Claudia [McNeil], Claudia playing Mama [Lena Younger] in the original production, the audience, the white audience--talking about making it resonate and going across they invested in her there ideal image of the mam, the mammy type, you know.  Now, unfortunate, George [C. Wolfe] had, George wrote a satirical thing erroneously in, in, in a way I mean and then got praise for it erroneously for the wrong reasons, I mean in a way.  He, in recognizing that the white audience invested in Mama, Big Mama, the mammy stereotype, he, George, unfortunately attributed that stereotype thing to a black, to black writers.  And that wasn't the case.  Mama, mom, Lorraine [Hansberry] didn't write a mammy stereotype.  It's just that when Claudia played it, and Claudia ampleness and all of those things that I can't fault, the audience insisted; the white audience insisted on it.  They didn't pay attention to what she was saying even.  They just insisted on making her be what, the image of what they wanted.  Now that, of course, may have led to its, their appealing, in appealing to them.  Now that wasn't the only factor.  I'm not saying that, that, that was the only factor and that all of the, all of the white audiences--but I think it, it did give, it made it more commercially possible for it to be successful.  Now, as you know, I've been (laughter) I, I've been in theater and done a million plays and directed a million; I've chosen a million and so forth, so I mean I've got, gotten a good perspective on audiences, the content of plays and everything like that and how and why they, they, they, they are liked or disliked or, or accepted or not accepted.  And I was there.  And you gotta remember that as far as Broadway is concerned, the percentage of, of audiences was always 80 to 20.  And I'm being, I'm being--
Speaker 1: Conservative.
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: You mean 80 percent white (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) White; that's--
Speaker 1: --yeah, right.
Speaker 2: I'm, it probably was (laughter) more 80, 8--
Speaker 1: Like 9, 90/10 (laughter), yeah.
Speaker 2: Not (laughter), yeah, 90/10--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --except for theater parts; 'cause remember, at that time, blacks were not going to the theater.  Black people were not going to Broadway nor legitimate theater.  And what happened is, every night, hey, except for theater parties where you get the, the, the, the sorority or something, you know, the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] have a theater party.  Most of the time that percentage of, of art, Broadway art, it was white.  Now it was interesting: by the time we went on the road, the play had taken on an event status for the black community to the point that when you went through certain black communities, shit, that was the only, that was the big event.  So we got better, we got better percentage of black attendance of many of the major big cities on the road than we ever did in New York, you know.  Now, I would like to say that, hey, the quality of the play itself--
Speaker 1: I have one more question--
Speaker 2: --the quali--
Speaker 1: --about the play.  We have one minute left on--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --this tape.  But, since you knew her, why do you feel that the--or I mean in my, you know, I see the play, and I'm, I don't leave feeling elated.  I, you know, it seems down to me.  I don't feel good even as a black man.  What is it--I don't under--them like, anyway, the ending of the play seems downtrodden-like.  He doesn't walk away victorious, Walter Lee [Younger], or am, is it just you, you, you're left to assume what you want, the way the play is written.
Speaker 2: No, think maybe, and I don't, you know, won't--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --get into debate with you--
Speaker 1: Right, right, yeah, yep.
Speaker 2: --in relation to, to this.  My thing is that it attempts to be, not a, you know, not positive and all opti- it attempts to be a positive ending in a way.  I think the thing there is that hey, everybody knows or, or, or instinctively you can speculate about it, but where they're going they're gonna catch hell.  So I mean it's not one of those happy endings.  It can't be a happy ending because we gonna go out, and we're gonna, we, we, we're gonna move into the neighborhood, but that's just the first step.  They move into that fucking neighborhood especially at that time, they're gonna get what happened in real life.  They're gon' get smoke bombed or whatever--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) okay.
Speaker 2: --happened.

Speaker 1: Continuing with [HistoryMaker] Mr. Douglas Turner Ward.  Today is November--
Speaker 2: Twenty-eighth, right, right
Speaker 1: --28th, 2006 [sic. November 29, 2006].  The location of this interview is 4 Times Square [New York, New York].  And we will continue on tape eleven.
Story_ID: 276577
Speaker 1: We left off talking about '[A] Raisin in the Sun' [Lorraine Hansberry].
Speaker 2: Yes, well, 'Raisin,' 'Rai-' you know, 'Raisin in the Sun,' as I explained before, came out of, partly out of my relationship with Lorraine [Hansberry].  And after she informed me that she had finished this play and it was gonna be done, Phil Rose [Philip Rose], the producer, was gonna do it, and she just wanted to alert me, since I'd become an actor, to give me a chance to get a chance to audition for it.  Well, anyway, I did audition for it, and, and, and of course, the director of the, the play was [HistoryMaker] Lloyd Richards, who had been my, my teacher when I studied at Paul Mann [Actor's Workshop].  So, you know, I was in a good position and hired eventually as, as the understudy in the original production to Sidney Poitier.  And we, you know, we, I remember it now, in fact, where we're sitting right now, we started rehearsal right down the street on 42nd Street I think at the, I forgot.  It's a fame, famous Broadway house that had been a Broadway house but, but had become a movie house, except that it's still on the roof.  The last four had, you know, had space for rehearsal, and you know, that company, that legendary company now gathered with, with Sidney, and [HistoryMaker] Ruby [Dee], and Claudia McNeil, and Diana Sands, and, and Lou Gossett [HistoryMaker Louis Cameron Gossett, Jr.], and Ivan Dixon, and Glynn Turman who was, was ten years old, you know, at that point.  And, and my friend Lonne [Elder III] played the small role of Bobo, and then all of us understudies.  And the understudies (laughter), the, we understudies also went on to, to our own independent fame later, 'cause the understudy to Claudia McNeil was the great actress of Beah Richards.  And Ed Hall, the late Ed Hall, was understudying the two, you know, the two male roles.  I, George Murchison and, and [Joseph] Asagai and I, I understudied Sidney and, and, and Bobo the role that Lonne played.  So we, you know, we--Frances Foster was understudying Ruby and Diana.  And we gathered there.  And at that point, the only thing we, we felt we had going was we had Sidney because Sidney had began to emerge as a, as a legitimate star.  We weren't sure just how commercial that was gonna be, but at least we had a name; you know, we had a, like, an unknown group of actors gathering together.  Of course, Ruby was a veteran, and, and Claudia, Claudia had done a few things, but Claudia had mainly been known for her singing, except for her appearance in Langston Hughes music, musical, I think 'Simply Heavenly.'  But, you know, Sidney was our, our, our leader.  Hopefully he was gonna be the, the name that might make it commercial.  And you know, it was, it was, it was a, a great gathering of people.  We were all quite, you know, the new generation in terms of being younger actors of that era.  And you know, we were all very strong-willed, strong-minded.  And as, as now, by now, if you went through all of the biographies of all the people now who, who have become legends themselves, you'd find out that (laughter) they were all strong-willed people, beginning with Lorraine, of course, who was, who's steel, steel trap (laughter) will, you know, Lorraine.  And basically, the rehearsal, you know, we, we got along very well, and, and we eventually went on the road.
Story_ID: 276578
Speaker 1: Let me just talk with you about, did you, did they, did you work with any type of method as an actor with, with that group of people?  Did you, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, we were all, basically, we were all on the same page as far as actors, acting go, starting with the fact that [HistoryMaker] Lloyd Richards was the director [of 'A Raisin in the Sun,' Lorraine Hansberry].  Now as I mentioned, Lloyd Richards was my, my teacher when, when, when I went to Paul Mann [Actor's Workshop].  But [HistoryMaker] Ruby [Dee] has also been at Paul Mann.  Sidney [Poitier] had been trained at Paul Mann.  In fact, Sidney was almost responsible for, for me and that whole, whole generation of younger black actors going to study at Paul Mann because he went there.  And that sort of led us to check it out, and we found out that you know, Paul was a great teacher and, and also had a, almost a philosophical social commitment to training minority actors.  And you know, it wasn't what, it wasn't just a sentimental thing.  He in his pedagogical philosophy and, and, and teaching purposes felt that he needed what now is considered, you know, diversity.  Well, Paul, Paul was in advance, and at that point he felt that his own teaching would not, would be improved if he had a wide diversity of students who brought a wide diversity experience into the, into the, the, the process.  And so, he began, he gave out scholarships.  In fact, I, I went to him on a scholarship, and I refused to even accept it, a full-scale scholarship, because I felt I needed to be prodded; I needed a reason (laughter) to, to, to put in 100 percent effort.  So if I had to sweep the toilets (laughter), I mean, I, I knew I'd better, I'd better put in the effort to study, you know, do that, that sort of shit work.  And so I, I only accepted a half scholarship.  But, so, getting back to when we got together, Diana [Sands], I don't know whether Diana had--I don't think Diana had at that point studied directly with Paul.  But, you know, she was of, of that same method and so was Frances [Foster] and, and it's the whole, the basically the whole, the whole company.  We are on the same page as, as actors.  We didn't come in with we're all method actors or anything like that.  It's just that we brought a conscious.  See, the only, only, the only, only thing about so-called being a trained actor is that you bring a consciousness of the craft into your work.  It doesn't make you any better or any different from another actor.  Like, for instance, Claudia [McNeil] basically had, was a natural without any real acting training.  That didn't stop her from being as great as she, she was.  It's just that we who were trained had a consciousness about, you know, our craft.  And therefore sometime it put us in a better position because, to a certain extent, that consciousness or craft, being trained with the consciousness of it, sort of prepared us in a better way to, to be consistent.  You know, it's like an actor who, who is not quite, has a, have a conscious craft.  They might be great one night, and the next night, I mean, measurably (laughter), you know, lower, and, and you know, maybe from night to night the consistency--well, when, when so, if you're trained, if you're supposed to know it, I mean that don't mean every actor live up to it.  But if you train as an actor, you're supposed to, you're supposed to do eight performances a week with ma- much, not, not much different between (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Hit the mark each time, yeah.
Speaker 2: --yeah, between, between one night to the next night.  Of course, there will be a difference.  I, I used to put it mechanically that, okay, maybe, maybe one, one night every two weeks I would be great.  But the other (laughter), you know, other seventeen performances I had to be excellent and never no less than good, you know, the standard that you, that you never go be--I don't care whether you're sick, whether you're crawling on stage, whether you break your leg.  There's a level that, if you're gonna go out there, that you were supposed to sustain, you know, sustain that, that level of results.
Story_ID: 276579
Speaker 1: So anyway, we, the rehearsal process [for 'A Raisin in the Sun,' Lorraine Hansberry] went quite even and, and well, no problems, you know, sort of changes that, that, that occurred in terms of Lorraine [Hansberry] had to tighten up the script.  And we sadly lost, in the process of her, her editing the script, we suddenly lost one of the actors who had, had started out with us.  Cynthia Belgrave, I think was the actress, but then the part, her role was cut.  And later on in life, I mean stupidly, Bobby [Robert Nemiroff] (laughter), Bobby never, after Lorraine was dead, with new production twenty years later, put that role back in, which was stupid because there was a reason when it was cut.  I mean it needed to be cut, you know, because it didn't belong.  It just was, it was a nice, funny role, but it had no, you know, just, just it had no purpose in terms of the, the, the script, so.  But we were all sad because I mean, you know, (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --being actors, everybody you know they got a job, and when you--and suddenly Cynthia lost her job.  But we knew that, that, you know, those are--I knew as a writer myself that that part had to go.
Story_ID: 276580
Speaker 1: Just to step back a moment, I don't know if you talked about this before, but when did you see your first professional play?
Speaker 2: My first professional play?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Wow, I think my first professional play had to come in my early days when I first came to New York [New York].  And, and as I've talked about it before with the two places: the Committee for the Negro in the Arts up in Harlem [New York, New York] put on, you know, shows.  In fact, it did Alice Childress work and, and, and Clarice Taylor.  I saw Clarice Taylor do a wonderful thing of, of '[A] Medal for Willie,' Bill Branch's [William B. Branch] play; and then also the left-wing theatre, which operated at that time at Jan Hus theater [sic. Czechoslovak House] I think somewhere there in Yorkville [Manhattan, New York, New York], which was 70, in the 70s, east.  And I saw, I remember a great production I saw of, of a Herb Tank play called 'Longitude 49,' which had Sidney [Poitier].  It was the first time I saw Sidney act and the great black actor, Frank Silvera; they were both in, in this play, and Frank, a memorable production, memorable acting job that I will never forget, and I still remember it vividly right now.   He played an Irish seaman.  And so, it was during period I mean, like, between the Committee for Negro in the Arts with, as I said, Alice Childress work and Bill Branch work, and the, the Left-Wing Theatre where I saw the Herb Tank play, saw another play that they did of Alice, and I also saw a production of Paul, Paul Green's [sic. Paul Peters] 'Nat Turner,' the title role, which, which Frank Silvera played the title role, Nat Turner.  Also, [HistoryMaker] Lloyd Richards was in that production as an actor, you know, playing, playing this, the servile Uncle Tom in that play.  So those were the, those were my first really professional--I still, still hadn't seen anything like on Broadway.  I don't think I saw anything on Broadway almost until I appeared on Broadway (laughter), you know.
Speaker 1: Then what became your first professional job as an actor?
Speaker 2: My professional job as an actor, I think I, I think I, I mentioned that, '[The] Iceman Cometh' [Eugene O'Neill].
Speaker 1: 'Iceman Cometh.'  We did talk about that.
Speaker 2: 'Iceman Cometh,' yes and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I remember that, yeah.
Speaker 2: --and, and that--
Speaker 1: And that was in '56 [1956]--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that, that, yeah--
Speaker 1: --back in the '56 [1956].
Speaker 2: --fifty [1950]. 'Iceman Cometh' was, was I think around '50 [1950], '57 [1957], '58 [sic. 1956].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, somewhere around that time.  And that led, of course, to, to, to 'Lost in the Stars,' I think I mentioned.
Story_ID: 276581
Speaker 1: And 'Lost in the Stars' almost came and led into to '[A] Raisin [in the Sun,' Lorraine Hansberry] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Raisin.'  And then you decided to go on the road with 'Raisin'?  How did that--
Speaker 1: Well, 'Raisin,' as, as, as, as I said, we, the original production, once we finished, we were scheduled to play two or three, three play I know that was set; that was New Haven [Connecticut] and I think Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and, and we had that and, but we didn't have a theater.  That was no theater, no Broadway theatre.  And we, we, we were only scheduled to be on the road about three or so.  I always remembered because when, when things changed, me and Lou Gossett [HistoryMaker Louis Cameron Gossett, Jr.] had to come back overnight to, to New York [New York] to get our things because what happened is the word got out after we opened in New Haven, the first stop, that something was going on, that this, this, this, this production was, was, was, had, had, had, had, had legs in, in the business, in the commercial business, Shuberts and all those people.  And so what happened is, once they thought that the show might have legs, they then made a deal with Philip Rose, the producer, that if, if he took the play, they didn't have a theater available.  But they might have a theater available.  There was a cup- Broadway, there were Broadway shows that were running, and, and there, a theater might become available later.  And if he was willing to go out on the road longer than we had been scheduled, that, that would give time for a theater to open up for, for, to be brought back into New York.  And so that's what happened.  After New Haven, suddenly that deal, we had to go to Chicago [Illinois]; you know, we had to go to Chicago for, for three or four weeks.  And we weren't prepared 'cause we thought, hey, we were gonna be back in New York in no time when we left.  But anyway, we (laughter), as I said, Lou and I had to rush back to get our clothes for a month's stay out, you know, out of New York.  And then we, you know, then we went on the road.
Story_ID: 276582
Speaker 1: I think I've--I think I've already told you about the, the episode with Lorraine [Hansberry] in, in New Haven [Connecticut] where, for, for, only time, the first time that, that I (laughter), I got into talking to her about the, about the play ['A Raisin in the Sun,' Lorraine Hansberry] when she tried to give, give Sidney [Poitier] some extra things to say that he had asked for, and then it turned out that it was bad writing.  So, (laughter) you know, I think I mentioned that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I don't think you did.
Speaker 1: I, I didn't mentioned (laughter)--you're talking about anecdotal--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --stories, well.  Anyway, in New Haven what is, apparently, what was being discovered is that at, that as far as the play went and the, the, the effect on the audience, the response of the audience, that suddenly Sidney--Walter Lee [Younger] was suddenly not getting the main lion's share of the applause; Claudia [McNeil] was.  So it was Mama [Lena Younger] that was, that, emerging as, as the dominant sort of audience favorite in relation to the play.  And I think what happened is, is Sidney (laughter) as an actor saw, said wait a minute.  I'm supposed to be the star of this play.  But I mean, I come out last, but before I come out, Claudia comes out a little before me and (laughter) saw that I'm by the--when I come out my applause, don't go up the level you know, on the meter it doesn't go any higher and almost, sometimes maybe less.  So anyway, he asked Lorraine maybe to, to put some writing in that would, would buttress, you know (laughter), the role in a, in a way that would give him a little, you know, a little more juice.  But Lorraine, rightfully, almost didn't want to do it, as I, I concluded.  Because when, when she did give him what he wanted, what he thought wanted, it was badly, bad writing.  And I just happened to be, you know, in the theater watching them perform 'cause I didn't have to go on stage until--
Speaker 2: Well, what was it that he wanted that she added that then turned out to be--
Speaker 1: Well, a writer--you know actors, I don't care how good they are, actors very often don't have the remotest I, they, they may have instincts that they want something sometime for the wrong reasons just to you know, add some, something, some lines that they think is gonna add juice to their role.  But, unless it's organic, it doesn't work.  And sometime they may have, their instincts may tell 'em, and they might be right.  And they need something, and then writer can, can, can relook at the script and organically provide it.  But, in this instance, it wasn't what, what, what he wanted, and what she reluctantly gave him didn't come out of her heart.  So, whether she knew it or not, it was, it, you know, as I said, it turned out to be bad writing.
Story_ID: 276583
Speaker 1: I just happened to be--'cause I didn't have to go on stage until the end of the show ['A Raisin in the Sun,' Lorraine Hansberry], as the moving man.  I only had this short appearance.  I could sit and watch the show until five minutes or so before the show was ending, when I had to go on.  So anyway, I happened to be sitting right behind her and, and, and, and, and, and Robert, Robert Nemiroff, her husband.  And I gasped (laughter) or did something, you know, vocal, when I heard these new lines that he was saying, I mean.  And, and of course, that caused them to turn around to look at me.  And while the show is going on they couldn't, we couldn't con- converse, so they--I, I--they just asked me in a gesture, you know, was that some, that was bad or something went wrong?  And I, and I just made a motion that, and whispered to 'em that I'll talk 'em in the, the, and then that's what happened.  Soon as intermission came we went out into the, to, to, you know, to the lobby, 'cause this was, this was in the first act, so I mean I, I still didn't have to, you know, be backstage; I still could go out in, in the lobby with them.  So I went out and I very, very, very shortly just told her.  I said, "Lorraine [Hansberry], I don't know what happened.  I, I said but what, I, I said I'm assuming that, that, you know, you were asked to provide some new, new material for Sidney [Poitier]."  I says, "But, and it seems like you didn't really agree."  I said, "And that's the way it sounds."  And she knew what I meant, 'cause what I mean is that you wrote something that you didn't agree to give, and therefore it didn't come out of your heart, and therefore it came out bad, and that's all.  I said it, and I, you know, that was, that, that was almost the end.  'Cause I, as I think I mentioned before, I never wanted, once I was in the show, I never wanted to draw attention to anything about our personal friendship.  I was a professional.  I was working as an actor.  I was not there.  I was an understudy, so I do my job and I had nothing to say or nothing to do with the production, the writing; I had no, no, you know, no--I don't care what I saw, I wasn't gon', you know, gonna say anything about, but it just inadvertent (laughter)--I just had to spontaneously respond to that, that moment that, that, you know, was, was unguarded.  And, and then I just explained it to her.  And, and, and for whatever, however it happened, it was gone; by the next performance it was gone.  I think, I think even Sidney realized that it was, it was not necessary.  And what, all it was, was there's a wonderful scene in, in, in the play where Walter Lee [Younger] talks about what he wants his wife to have.  And what is, is that he, he's very specific and concrete about the things that he would like to have his wife when he's talking about, you know, his not having money, not having the means.  And, and he talks about, 'bout--and, and, and her, her images are very concrete, specific.  You know, I want curtains; I want, you know, I want dishes, you know, very--well, when she added to it, he started talking about stars in the sky and, and all of that abstract flowery nonsense, blue (laughter), you know, that, that, that, that flowery stuff that didn't belong to the character, didn't belong to the play.  It was bad writing because suddenly it took away.  The specificity of that moment suddenly was diluted by all this nonsense (laughter), you know, this flowery writing that she added to it.  And that's what, what, what basically I was trying (laughter), responded to, and that's what finally she, it, it was gone.
Story_ID: 276584
Speaker 1: But anyway, that, that, that was New Haven [Connecticut].  That was our first stop.  And that's when I said earlier, that suddenly, once we were in, in, in previews [of 'A Raisin in the Sun,' Lorraine Hansberry] and so forth, the, the, New York [New York] ownership scene became aware that maybe something was afoot.  So anyway, they made this deal that we'd go, we, if we went on the road.  So then we went, we went, we went to Chicago [Illinois], which is Lorraine's [Lorraine Hansberry] hometown.  And--
Speaker 2: Well, one thing you talked about that I want to have you comment on is that you said that there is a new breed of actor, a new generation of actor appeared: you, there's [HistoryMaker] Louis [Cameron] Gossett [Jr.], [HistoryMaker] Ruby [Dee], [HistoryMaker] Ossie [Davis], Sidney [Poitier].  Why do you think what was happening in the country or what had happened prior for this explosion of new black actor to come onto the scene?
Speaker 1: Well, you, you have to remember, we, we, we not too far away from the new generation when--let's, let's set it at the, the end), the postwar generation.  We--Sidney's a little older.  Ossie was, was I think even older than Sidney (unclear) but, 'cause they'd been in, they had been, in wartime I think they'd been in 'Anna Lucasta' [Philip Yordan] back in the, in, in, you know, the '40s [1940s], during '46 [1946], '45 [1945] [sic.], somewhere in the, in that period.  But, after the war, there's, there's our gen, my generation was coming in, in, into maturity.  As I said earlier, I became, I came to New York [New York] when I was eighteen years old, which, you know, 1948 I think.  And this new--we, the, you know, was a, the emp- the, the postwar era was a, was a new era for black people in particular in every way.  The G.I.s coming back, the attitude, you know, new, new, new, new attitude of, of struggle, wanting to not accept the, the racist discriminatory world that we lived in.  And this became--the, the G.I. Bill [Serviceman's Readjustment Act of 1944] was providing education, opportunity for education.  The attitude of, of, of, of my generation as teenagers through the Second World War [World War II, WWII] of, of this whole thing about the, the, the, the double thing, fighting against [Adolf] Hitler and at the same time fighting against segre- [segregation] so we, we, we, we had a more militant attitude and between the access to education.  So we then brought not a new attitude--black people have always had the same attitude about their oppression--but new opportunities to fight a, against the oppression came in various ways: educationally, labor, politically and everything else.  And we, we sort of were that, that crest of that moment, which led us, as I said earlier, even though we didn't have any, any, any, there, there wasn't any opportunities, big opportunities opening up on Broadway and in, and in American theater, but if we wanted to become actors and writers, we took it upon ourselves to train ourselves or learn the craft.  You know, we were not--even if the opportunities weren't there, we wanted, you know, we had a, we, we had a vocation for it, and we knew that we had to, we had to study and so forth.  And that's sort of led us, as I said, to, to, like Sidney leading, leading the, the, the, the thing and going to Paul Mann [Actor's Workshop] and oth- other teachers; you know other teachers were around.  Thinking about Diana [Sands], like for instance, Diana had, had, reason why Diana hadn't really gone to Paul [Mann] then because Diana had come out of the, the, the, the high school system of New York, which had a professional, New York had a professional arts high school [High School of the Performing Arts; Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, New York, New York].  Diana had already been trained in term, from, from high school.
Story_ID: 276585
Speaker 1: Then when we, like to, to, to end this, to give you an idea, just before '[A] Raisin [in the Sun,' Lorraine Hansberry] started, though, that generation, this generation, we all felt that, look, even if we got jobs in, in regular, in, in, in, in establishment theater, they probably not gonna be the roles--
Speaker 2: What roles (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) that we, that we--
Speaker 2: --right.
Speaker 1: --felt were, were, were, were, were, were gonna be challenging for us, that we're still gonna be trapped with some of the same roles that still existed for our previous generation, which, which, which had, had, had, had even misused the talent.  So we all got together and twenty of us, for instance--I mean this'll give you a good idea of, of--twenty of us got together and said no matter what happens to us individually, commercially, whether we work or not, we are going to establish a group where we will produce and, and, and call the shots on our own.  Now, in, in a, in a, in a, in a lot of ways, you know, historically and biographically, people gonna, pe, people are gonna con, gonna assume some day when my biography's written that, okay, I was already prepared for this because I had already, it turned that I had already, during the early days when Lorraine [Hansberry] and I were in the Progressive Movement, I had already written; I had already written an (laughter) article calling for what, what later on I, I said became the proposal for the NEC [Negro Ensemble Company].  This was sort of interim, was similarly to that.  We got together, twenty of us got together and said we're gonna do an independent group.  You know, we're gonna, we're gonna do the type of works we wanted, we wanted to do to challenge ourselves.  Many of us had already been informally meeting together to read certain things together, to test ourselves in, in, in terms of like reading [William] Shakespeare's works together and all of that sort of thing as practice, so, twenty of us.  Five, five of that group, iron- [ironically] wound up in 'Raisin,' and, and almost that was the thing that almost killed the group.  Because when we just were at the point when you asked me that question, we, we, we, when we were taken out of town, when we had to go out of town, five of us from that twenty were in 'Raisin in the Sun': me, Lou [HistoryMaker Louis Cameron Gossett, Jr.], Diana [Sands], Beah [Richards], and, and Frances [Foster]; five of us were in it; five of the leading people in that group were in that twenty group.
Story_ID: 276586
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Can you name the five people?
Speaker 1: Yes, the, myself, Diana Sands, Beah Richards, Frances Foster, and Lou Gossett [HistoryMaker Louis Cameron Gossett, Jr.].  We were all in '[A] Raisin [in the Sun,' Lorraine Hansberry], and we were, we were, you know, pillar of, of, of the group.  We're called I think the Manhattan Arts Theater we called ourselves.
Speaker 2: That the twenty called themselves (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The twenty, right.
Speaker 2: --Manhattan Arts--
Speaker 1: Mount--you know, in there was Godfrey Cambridge.  There were five of us who were in, in, in 'Raisin,' and about five others of that group got independent work, you know.  So what happened is, 'cause like I mentioned Godfrey Cambridge, 'cause at that point, Godfrey Cambridge was just beginning to emerge as a comedic (laughter), you know, entertainer.  So Godfrey suddenly had dates, you know, touring dates and, and what happened is five of us in 'Raisin' and about let's say five of the other people got independ- in, independent jobs, and therefore that took us out of town.  And the other ten got jealous, which I tried to, to, to ward off and tried to be the counsel against.  But they got, they got, they got jealous of the fact that they weren't working.  And then they, they, they proceeded to, to, to use to the money that we had got together to do a production, which was the last thing that we needed.  And, and not only did they did a production, but they chose a play that, that needed a cast of thousands almost and therefore went, went beyond the group.  See, 'cause I, my, my, 'cause I was sort of the ma- the, the mind behind the whole thing in terms of like how, you know, how, how, how, how, how to, how to, to, to, to, to proceed with it.  And we, we, before we left, we had decided that we were gonna do a four-character play of Beah Richards.  But we're gonna do things that stayed within the group where we could control the situation.  We were not going to try to be like commercial producers, going out auditioning people outside the group and coming up with--anyway, the, that, that, that worked to the disadvantage of, of, of sustaining, you know, the group.  But, in answer to--I'm using the, the twenty people as, in answer to your question about that, what happened with that era and that generation.  This, this was the type of thing that we were prepared to, to do for ourselves.  We knew that we had to, we, we had to develop standards.  We knew we had to be, be, be trained in our craft and all of these things.  And that's the thing that, that wasn't, wasn't different because we, even though the American Negro Theatre had, was, had been in decline, and Sidney [Poitier] and, and, and [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte had been in, in, in, in American Negro Theatre at the sort of end of it, that was a great period prior, before the war [World War II, WWII].  I mean that was wonder--but the war had interrupted that group.  And by the time postwar, it had went into decline, and the people in that group, excellent actors, great actors, including the, the, the actor that, that, as I said, was sort of wasted, his, his talent was sort of wasted on, on, on the television production of Amos, 'Amos and Andy' ['Amos 'n' Andy'].  What's, was, was the, he was the husband of, of Alice Childress, I think Alvin Childress.  There were--I could, you know, there were the, a whole roster of excellent actors who couldn't get anything else but stereotypical work of that older generation.  And as I said, their talent had been wasted, not, you know, that, that, you know, they, they, they, their talent was wasted.  And in some instances, their talent had been coarsened brutalized almost by doing the stereotypical work that it affected, you know, their, their, their modern so-called abilities.  I was faced with this much later with, with the NEC [Negro Ensemble Company] and one of the reasons why I became the resident old man of black theater when I was (laughter), when I was still in my thirties.  Because when I went to get that generation that should have been there in their fifties and sixties, they weren't, either they weren't there, or in some instances, their, their approach to acting was, was, was, was so coarsened and, and stereotypical till, you know, it was not, it didn't fit the modern new plays that were being, being, being presented.  But anyway, that, that, that answered your question in a sense that, that what happened?  It was the postwar, the change in to a different stage of attitudes and, and, and possibilities that allowed us to get a leg up in relation to being, I would say, more modernistic in our craft, and our attitudes and everything.
Story_ID: 276587
Speaker 1: Well, given that you, you know, the cast, that Lorraine [Hansberry] was the first African American woman to have a play produced on Broadway, did that weigh with the cast?  Did you feel a sense of pride?  Did you, did, did it come into play at all?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we did, but what I just mentioned.  We, in our attitude and in our consciousness we were already ahead of that.  You know, we were already, the things I just mentioned there.  We, our thinking was already ahead of that, just that satisfaction.  So, by the time we got together, as I told you earlier, to go into rehearsal for '[A] Raisin in the Sun,' we went to the, the, the Ambassador [sic.] whatever, that, that, that theater right down the street there on 42nd [Street, New York, New York].  We, it almost, in answer, we were almost not cynics.  It was nice that this was happening.  We were happy for lane--Lorraine, and was happy to get a, a, a shot on Broadway and so forth, but we had already conditioned ourselves to try to create a theater for ourselves that was not limited.  Now, a lot of people will think: limited, well, what's--for us, for, for us, for Broadway, and I guess that conditioned me for the rest of my life.  I have never wanted or never needed to have a (laughter) play on Broadway.  I knew and, and to, to, you know, even now, to, to my, my, my twilight of my career, I don't write.  The way I write, the things I write, I know the chances of, of being on Broadway.  In fact, in some instances, I don't even don't want it.  Of course, right now, I wouldn't want it on Broadway.  And even after, even with the NEC [Negro Ensemble Company], we only went to Broadway because, and I'll get into that much later, but the, you know, we were already ahead of, ahead of that, that thing.  Now, that didn't make us proud of Lorraine's achievement.  We felt that Lorraine, in the first place, had written a, a wonderful play, and we were happy that it was being done, and we were, were, were, were, were looking forward to what it might do if it succeeded.  But we still, we were cynical.  We didn't, we didn't expect 'Raisin in the Sun' to (laughter), we tell you the truth, we, we, we were hoping, our hopes at that, that time, in terms of commercial theater, is that it would provide us with thirteen weeks.  I think it was thirteen weeks, thirteen weeks employment that would make us able to collect--
Speaker 1: Eligible for unemployment.
Speaker 2: --unemployment.  That, that was the--I would go, and that's, as far as 'Raisin' went, I mean that's basically, and I mean, I don't know about Sidney [Poitier] and all of them who, who had careers, but as far as us peons (laughter), which to a certain extent, all of us, we had no hope.  We, if it, it, if, if it, if it happened, fine.
Story_ID: 276588
Speaker 1: So after the, the twenty, after that group dispersed, because you're on the road, the other, you know, five (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, it didn't--we weren't, we didn't know it was gonna disperse until afterwards 'cause we still were--
Speaker 1: Until they did the bad play.
Speaker 2: No, we, it was only until we finally got back that, that the, the bad news happened.  But, so, we were still hoping that we could, you know, that, that, that was the alternative.  We didn't--we, we, we still had that as an alternative.  Even, even when we were in '[A] Raisin in the Sun' [Lorraine Hansberry] we still were thinking more of, of the Manhattan Arts Club [Manhattan Arts Theater] as, at our activity there as being almost more proment- primary.
Speaker 1: Why did you call yourselves the Manhattan Arts Club?
Speaker 2: I, I don't know.  At, at that point I think there was no big reason except that most of us, that all of our functions, that all of us either lived in Harlem [New York, New York], you know, either lived in Harlem or functioned in Harlem and--
Speaker 1: But there's nothing specifically black about that name.
Speaker 2: No, no, we weren't, at, not at, at that point we weren't even, you know, we, you know, the name thing wasn't that significant to us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) It, like, even the name thing that, that, that I got in trouble with later, I mean it, it, it almost proves that I was never, I don't care about the name.  It's (laughter), it's, it's the result of the work.
Speaker 1: What name things did you get in trouble with later?
Speaker 2: Oh, much later, with the--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay--
Speaker 2: --the Negro, Negro Ensemble [Company]--
Speaker 1: --Negro, no, right, right, okay.
Speaker 2: --you know, the whole thing there.  But, but, so anyway, we weren't--we, we thought, we, we, we almost felt regretful that we had to be out of town that long because it, it interrupted our, our plans for the Manhattan Arts Theatre.  So when we went out of town, we, we didn't know whether we would of be suc- successful.
Speaker 1: So you next--
Speaker 2: But once we got--
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: --to Chicago [Illinois], even we in the company began to think well, wait a minute, wait a minute.  The, this, this, the audience reaction to this show is, maybe, maybe we got something here that, that maybe can make it for a couple of more months (laughter), you know, give us twenty-six weeks unemploy- work before unemployment.
Story_ID: 276589
Speaker 1: And also the interesting thing about Chicago [Illinois] is that, different from New Haven [Connecticut] and different from what we later faced on Broadway, you know, we got, we, we, we, since it was Lorraine's [Lorraine Hansberry] hometown, the black audience there was not in the majority, not, not, it wasn't even a large minority.  But there was a significant black public that came during the three, three weeks we were there.  Now, later on, that became very significant because when, as I told you, by the time we went on the road after Broadway, then, going through the twenty or thirty, how many, twenty cities I think we went through, the, in the big cities our audiences were, were in many instances at least 50 percent black by then.  But, no, in the early days, the first time sure wasn't that much because black people didn't go to the theater.  There was no, you know, black, there was no, no, no, no habit of black people going to the theater.  Many came out because Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier], the black newspapers, Lorraine's hometown, a lot of, you know, lot of things, publicity surrounded it, that it was an event in town, that the black bourgeois particular, you know, came out in, in, in, in, in, in some numbers, maybe 10, 15 percent at least at that point, okay, but anyway, the buzz around her; we got, we got excellent reviews from the main critics.  I mean Claudia Cassidy was the, the, the, the doyen of, I mean of, of, of just like The New York Times with, with, with Clive Barnes and, and, and before that, you know, Clive, you know, the, the, the, you know, whoever was in The New York Times he was, Chicago, Claudia Cassidy was that, had that same power.  So we got, we got these excellent reviews, so we said mate a--wait a minute; maybe there's something here.  Then we, we, we played Chicago, and then we, we, we came back and I think we played Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And by that time, a Broadway house opened up; I mean a, availability of a Broadway theater opened up. And then by the time we got to New York [New York], the buzz about this show had built up, you know.  And, and, and, and then, so oaf- opening night was like a, an event in American theater, you know and all of that and so forth.  So it, it, it, it happened, and we knew that the response--at that point Broadway shows always like they always have been.  But even more, at that point it, the, the, the power of the critics, because there was seven, seven or eight daily newspapers in New York then, you know, seven or eight daily newspapers then, 'cause eve, even when my plays opened like, like ten, what, ten years later, still open there with seven or eight daily papers.  So it's almost like you could get a lukewarm review from The New York Times.  It didn't matter because if the other six came up with glowing re- reviews, that you--New York Times didn't, didn't matter.  But you know, nowadays, I mean, the only paper that matters is New York Times.  But anyway, we got all of the, the notices, you know, I mean excellent notices.  And I always memorably remember one particular notice we got which I respected the most, more than all of, all of 'em, was the critic I respected most at that time who was, who was sort of doing a stint, just a, a, a temporary stint at, at The New Yorker.  And that was, that was the great, the great British critic, Tynan, Kenneth Tynan.  And he, oh, Kenneth Tynan wrote a review that eve, even I thought was a little excessive.  I mean he ja- because not only, the review wasn't excessive, but he, he gave '[A] Raisin [in the Sun,' Lorraine Hansberry] this, this great review in the same issue that he also reviewed 'Sweet Bird of Youth' [Tennessee Williams].  And he gave, he, he gave 'Raisin' this great glowing review, but he to me, he, he, he underestimated 'Sweet Bird of Youth.'  I mean even though we benefited from it, and he, he didn't affect the run of 'Sweet Bird of Youth' because, I mean, you know, his review by it, by itself wasn't gonna do that, but I always felt that, that, you know, 'Sweet Bird of Youth' was, was, was--he didn't, he didn't really hear it or see it's writing, 'cause I've, I, I, I had a, a, a more positive judgment of the play and, and so forth.  And, but that was always ironic that we were twinned at the same--we opened I think the night before or the night after, so the two plays opened right, right on each other.  And that's, that's the one; that's, that's the--the 'Sweet Bird of Youth' production was the one with Paul Newman, you know.  But anyway, we opened; it was like, boom, that was, that, it was an event.  And from then on, I mean, you know, we were the talk of the town and so forth.
Story_ID: 276590
Speaker 1: I only smile when you said something about, about was I writing 'Day of Absence' [Douglas Turner Ward].  No, during the run of, of, of '[A] Raisin in the Sun' [Lorraine Hansberry] on Broadway, everybody knew; I mean when I always, everybody always knew that even though I was an actor, that I was supposed to be (laughter) writing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A writer.
Speaker 1: --plays.  But as it turned out, particularly the women in, in the, in the cast, always were, were, were mad at me or, or frustrated with me because they, they thought I should have been writing.  But, as far as my behavior during the run of 'Raisin in the Sun,' they thought I spent more time trying to (laughter), trying to seduce, you know, the women who came to see the show, that I'm there to, to do writing.  So they, they're always shaking their head at the fact that I mean you're supposed to be writing, but you're not doing any writing.  You're spending most of your time trying to write on the backs of these women.  That's what, that's what your prob- so, they were sort of right about it, because I wasn't doing too much writing.  But, hey, things were gestating, (laughter) you know, at that period, and eventually after, in fact.  It was, it was, it was, it was 'Raisin in the Sun' that provided me with the leisure, as I put it, to then concentrate on writing--
Speaker 2: So what came after--
Speaker 1: --when I got back.
Speaker 2: --'Raisin' for you?  Did you write, or did you do 'Ceremonies [in Dark Old Men,' Lonne Elder III]?
Speaker 1: Well, what, that's what I'm saying: 'A Raisin,' after 'A Raisin' and, and, and, and, and after the Broadway.  See, the Broadway run was one thing.  And that was like, you know, as, as, as I said, I'm, I'm, as the women say, I'm waste (laughter), I'm wasting my time concentrating, you know, on, on, on, you know, on, on my organ (laughter), my mid organ rather than my typewriter.  But any, anyway that, the Broadway run and, and you know, that was, it, it was a great, a great run.  And you know, it was all backstage tumult and, and all kinds of, of stories that, that will only, I can only tell after (laughter), after most of the participants are gone.  (Laughter) I mean half of 'em are gone anyway that I could finally tell, tell the true story about some of the things (laughter) that went on.  But anyway, the, the Broadway show ran about a year and a half.  I think we opened somewhere in, in December, November [sic. March], whatever, and, and we ran a year, into the following year, so it was about four, thirteen, four, thirteen, fourteen months on Broadway.  Then we eventually, the end runned it--end, ended close to, to summer of, of '60 [1960], yeah, I think '60 [1960].  And by that time, they'd already planned the tour.
Story_ID: 276591
Speaker 1: For me, I re- as, as you asked me earlier, I, I remained--I understudied Sidney [Poitier] throughout his stay.  Three or four months before the run [of 'A Raisin in the Sun,' Lorraine Hansberry] ended Sidney left, and [HistoryMaker] Ossie [Davis] took over the, the role of Walter Lee [Younger].  And Ossie played it until the end of the run.  Now, of course, you know Ru, [HistoryMaker] Ruby [Dee], but I think Ossie played with Ruby.  And for some reason, I think Ruby left even while Os, Ossie was playing, because I know Frances Foster took over for Ruby, I think, while Ossie was playing it at the end of the run.  And as I say, everybody in the company were all, all, all, were more pissed off than, than I was when the fact that, that they didn't hire me after a year, almost a year or so, in, in, in understudying.  But, as I said, I, I had no choice; I mean I'm making a salary.  You know, I (laughter), I wasn't gon' spite, you know, you know, cut off my nose to spite my face by giving up some money, by saying oh, you're not giving me the role?  I had, I had no alternative, you know.  I wasn't white (laughter).  Usually we said, we'd always cynically say, "I wasn't white."  See, a white person will say ah, shit, I got another job to go to.  No, I said look, this is the job that I got; I mean there's no other, there's no job, job on the horizon, you know.  I'm not gonna get another job leaving 'Raisin' (laughter).  As an understudy I'm gon' get a--I said no.  I stayed there as long as they paid my salary.  Now, I made sure they gave me some more money and so forth.  And, and they did give, give me money, not what, what I, what I deserved, but they gave me some more money out of their own guilt.  But I also, during the run of the show, in my own critical fas- critical fas- you know, facilities, objectively had also analyzed the needs of, of, of the play ideally.  And I had also come to the conclusion that I was still too young for that part anyway intellectually and craft-wise.  I felt that, you know, I, I, I was even righter in my interpretation than Sidney could be.  Essentially, Sid- Sidney's only drawback in relations to Walter Lee.  And if you look at the movie and, and, and, and so forth, his only drawba- is Sidney is, Sidney, Sid, Sidney, Sidney is, is Bermudian I think.  Sidney is West, West Indian, as we say, his rhythms.  Walter Lee is ideally the son of, of, of, of, of Mississippi sharecroppers, you know, even though he's born in Chicago [Illinois].  He's born north, but, you know, you come out of a black family, I mean it never--his folks were from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Mississippi (laughter).
Speaker 1: --Mississippi, and there is a, you know, a rhythm of speech in relation to the dialogue that--and, and, and I used to, it used grate on my ear every night when Sidney sometime would come to, to, to, to certain key parts of the, the play when he has those sexual when he talk about--he gets mad at, at Rufus' wife, and so I mean, you know, I'm talking to you about something, and you, and then you, you, you talking about eat your eggs.  That's a--and it keeps repeating.  Now, now there, there, there's a, there, there's a, there's a, a Southern and a black rhythm to that sort of repetition.  "I'm talking to you about, 'bout (laughter), about making some money, and all you can say is eat your eggs.  I'm talking to you about this, and all you can say is eat your eggs."  I mean and, and that sort of rhythm that Sidney, Sidney, is flat.  I mean he (laughter), that was not he--it had made no difference in terms of, of, of, of the moment.  But, I mean I knew that the way, the way it's written, the, the, the idiom of it, that, that, that was not--and if you listen to Sidney's attack on, on many, even now it's wonderful, but it's not (laughter), you know, it's not, not, doesn't have that flavor in, in, in terms of it.  And that, so those are the elements that I--but I also felt that even though Sidney, Sidney's only about five years old, old, older than I am, even Sidney, at the point that we did the play, wasn't, age-wise, wasn't ideally right for it, and I come to that.  So, therefore, I also had no, no frustration.  I felt, hey, egotistically I felt if, if I had to play it I would, you know, I'd tear it up.  But not getting it didn't, didn't--you know, I, I could understand.  I didn't know whether they made the decision based on the same est- analysis that I did, but it didn't matter to me.  I knew that ideally that, you know, hey, I was still in my, my late twenties.
Story_ID: 276592
Speaker 1: And that role ideally even though when, when they hired [HistoryMaker] Ossie [Davis], and I'm not--now that I'm thinking about it, they didn't make the same estimate and analysis that I did because then when they hired Ossie, it was almost, not that Ossie, Ossie was almost too old for it, not so much too old, but Ossie's presence is, is too stolid, was too stolid, you know.  Walter Lee [Younger] is, is, is a, is, is, is a, you know, I mean it's not stolidity; it's, it's (laughter), you know, quicksilver; you know, it's a quicksilver, street dude, you know, I mean street dude sort of thing, I mean a dude who, who, who would be comfortable at least on the street.  Our, our, ours, you know, ours is the, the, the solemn, the, the, the Solomonic (laughter) or the solemn, I mean the one who give the, the father, the grandfather, who gives out the, the word (unclear) you know, it, that, that wonderful persona of his.  He was funny but, but stolid, you know, it's earthbound in, in, in a particular way.  So when I, I--but, but I still understudied Ossie when he took it over.  Then, when, when finally they announced going on the road and they still didn't give it to me, and they hired a, a, you know, another actor, I, you know, finally I had to make a decision.  Was I gonna go on the road as an understudy [in 'A Raisin in the Sun,' Lorraine Hansberry]?  I mean and so forth once again to be pragmatic.  And I said okay.  If I go on the road and they pay me enough to make it worthwhile, that is going to really position me to really be independent enough to concentrate on my writing.  You know, that's the way I esti- so I mean I had no problem about going on the road as an understudy.  And ironically, the actor they hired to take over the road for the road company fitted my ideal, I mean, and he, he, he was perfect.  And one day or someday in, in part, part of my interview with you all will put it on record, at least, because it needs--nobody knows this because of the tragedy that had happened, is that he, this, this, this actor, his name will, you know, will come to me before--was perfect age, Elwood Smith, Elwood Smith, was a perfect age.  He was of Sidney's [Sidney Poitier] generation, had been one of the actors who sort of like, and one of the problem with, with, with the tragedy that happened to him is he was of that generation, that they were all of Sidney's time and, and age, and when Sidney made it, it's almost like for these, the black actors of his generation, they realized that there was only room for one quote nigger.  I mean you gon' (laughter) just put it bluntly: there's only one nigger allowed.  And they knew that once Sidney was the one that, that sort of squashed their chances of, of it in the competition let's say.  They were not gonna be the one.  And for some, hey, some of 'em dealt with it, you know, realistically, but for some, it ate at 'em.  And I think Elwood was, was, was one of the people that it ate at unduly.  And so what happened is, when he got hired, he was already either full-scale or on his way to becoming an alcoholic.  And, but, acting-wise, oh he had all, all of the qualities.  And he had what I considered the main quality of the role when I was, I was too young.  See, when Walter Lee gets on--tells his mama that, mama, I see all those white guys out there no older than me, and they got this; they got that; they doing this and so forth.  And you know, mama, this is my last chance.  Now, for me, at twenty-nine, not just age-wise, but that, but my, the energy, you know, the, the, the force you bring at it.  Even our audience wouldn't be conscious of it, but subconsciously you know it's not my last chance.  You know, with all of that, you know that, that, at that point, age, force and everything else, that I got some, I got many more chances.  So, therefore, my request to my mother to give me the money, it turns out to be less momentous or, or, or less important, so it becomes more childish.  But,  but if a forty year old man, you know, as I just put it, before somebody forty years old says it's their last chance, to do something, you know, it, it has more meaning.
Story_ID: 276593
Speaker 1: I was talking about Elwood Smith (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Elwood, yeah.
Speaker 1: --Elwood Smith, who, who was perfect for, for the role [Walter Lee Younger] and that's because, you know, his, his, his age.  He was, had the right rhythm (laughter), as I talked about earlier, for it, and 'cause he was a, you know, not necessarily a southerner, but he came out of, you know, a mainland, American context.  And so, when, when we went on the road, and the interesting thing about the moment that we went on, went, went on the road is that there was a, like a two or three months hiatus between the end of the Broadway run and our collecting to go on the road and you're talking about anecdotal thing.  What had happened is, Claudia [McNeil] and Diana [Sands] had gone away to make the movie, you know, the classic movie that, that, of, of '[A] Raisin [in the Sun].'  They'd gone away after the, the show ended.  They went to Hollywood, and that's when that period of time, that summer the, the movie was made.  And ironically, Claudia and, and, and Diana had left at the end of the run as bosom buddies.  And then when we got back together they weren't (laughter), they weren't speaking.  So we, we sort of, the ones of us who had remained in New York [New York], we had no idea what had happened, they being bosom, bosom buddies and, and then, and then, then weren't speaking when they, when we got back.  But we had a spy who was among them when they were away because, and nobody knew it except me.  Lonne Elder [III], who was, was, was, was, you know, played Bobo and was having a relationship with Diana, when Diana had went away to, to make the movie, she had him come along with her.  But she (laughter) didn't want nobody to know, so she had him, she had him like secretly ensconced in, in someplace where, where nobody, even the people in, in Hollywood didn't know that he was there.  But he was able (laughter), he was able to give us a blow-by-blow account of, of all of the, the things that had gone on between Claudia and so forth and Diana that, that had severed their relationship.  And to tell you the truth, I mean with, with the personality of, of both of 'em, and, and, and me telling you about it now, I have not, I don't even remember what, what it was that Lonne told us that had happened.  But we knew both of 'em were so, so fickle, and fragile, and, and, and messed up to a certain extent (laughter) that it could have been anything; it could have been either one 'em.  But all we knew is that they left as good friends.  When they came back to go on the road, they (laughter), they were not speaking.  Now the ha- the idea that Claudia and Diana were going on the road is, is revealing.  And even though they had both become stars and, and, and quite, quite, quite reputable and well-known in show business to a certain extent, they had no other options.  Now if they, if either one of them had been a--Claudia as, as a mature actress or Diana as a, as an ingenue, if either one of 'em, quote, let's put it, had been white, they would not have been able almost to stay in, in, in 'Raisin' for the length of time of the Broadway run.  I mean Hollywood and so forth would have come and, and, and they'd had too many offers.  They would not have been able to stay in the show as long as they did on Broadway.  Then, after they went away and made the movie, you know, even though the movie wasn't released yet, the fact that they were able to go on the road, I mean was, was almost like insulting to a certain extent because I mean they should have not been available to go on the road.  But once again, just like I say when I said I had no option but to go as a understudy because, hey, it was my employment--even for them, would become renown now; I mean a whole year and half of a show they had tons of publicity and so forth.  They, there were no other measurable offers, you know, for them to go.  And I'm sure that, that, that management, Phil Rose [Philip Rose] is the manager then still had to pay them enough to interest them to go on the road.  But the fact that they, they, they, they, they were even available to go on the road is very, you know, very revealing, which, which led me at that point that I coined the phrase that a lot of actors still use, is that all, the, that, that what we needed to do is that once we got all these glowing reviews and notices, that all we could do is rent 'em to white actors who could use 'em (laughter), you know.  I mean I say that always, you know.  People say oh, boy, you got a great review.  I say yes, we, you know, we, we got great notices, but you can't (laughter), ain't nothing gon' happen with them, so all we can do with 'em is rent 'em to some white actors who can use 'em, you know.  But anyway, the fact that when we got together to go on the road, you know, that, that they were able to go on the road.
Story_ID: 276594
Speaker 1: Second thing, which goes back to a question you asked me earlier about our attitude in relation to pride, even, '[A] Raisin in the Sun' [Lorraine Hansberry] management--and, and they, they asked [HistoryMaker] Lloyd [Richards] to do it, so Lloyd had to, had to carry out the deed.  Just before we left, 'cause we only had like a week's rehearsal in New York [New York] before we went to Boston [Massachusetts], which was our first stop, they had Lloyd give us a lecture about we were representing, you know, the show, the, the race (laughter), I mean the whole work.  And everybody used to look at me because I, I'm--and, and during by now, during the, during times like this, since I've been in the show so long, and I didn't have to think about lines, and since I wasn't playing the role, I'd just sit back and, and listen to everything that went on, doing The New York Times crossword puzzle.  And so, and, and, and, and everybody know how tart tongue I could be about certain things (laughter) and certain bullshit till, while, while Lloyd's giving this lecture, everybody's, everybody got their eye on me see (laughter).  They see me doing the crossword just to see that somewhere along the line they gonna, they gon' catch me with a reaction which said man, why did you (laughter)--the hell with that shit.  And sure enough, we all talkin' about it's not that we weren't prideful and we, so forth.  But by this time, we were so--our identity was so intact till we weren't interested in acting correctly about anything except through our, through, through, you know, through our own, through our own ethics or morals or what have you.  And as far as we knew, we were, we were the first company, just like you said, the first (unclear) we were the first black company that was going on the road--I don't know--you know, in regular, you know, playing regular theaters and all of that I don't, I don't--in ages.  So, from management and all those people, I mean this was a big thing, and don't mess up.  Don't, don't, don't (laughter), you know, don't embarrass--
Speaker 2: (Unclear) what year did you go on the road?
Speaker 1: Oh, in '60 [1960].
Speaker 2: Sixty [1960].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, prior to this, theaters had been legally segregated.
Speaker 1: Oh yes, a few places.  We were basically going through quote northern cities, but we were skirting some of the, the edges of, we were like Louisville [Kentucky]--
Speaker 2: South.
Speaker 1: --and, and places, Kentucky and, and, and maybe one or two other places that were right on, on, on the, on the, the, the border of the Mason-Dixon [Line].  Most of 'em were, were, were, you know, Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and, and, and, and, and, and, and Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] and, and, and, and, and Detroit [Michigan] and so forth.  But, anyway, we, so we, we, we sort of took, took, took the lecture with, with one ear and out the other because we, when I say we're so secure in our identity, we, we weren't gonna, we didn't go, weren't gonna go out there to mess up, I mean to, to act like a bunch of fools or anything like that.  But we, we were gonna act like we, (laughter), we, we, with the freedom.  You know, we, we, our main function and, and we felt was that we gon', we, we gon' do the show, and we're gonna do an excellent show.  But off stage, that was our own life.  And we weren't, we weren't gon' be self-conscious going out there for a year on the road won- wondering about our behavior.  And of course, you know, also by this time, we had all, as I said, internally and with our objectives externally, particularly, particularly me and, and my, my, at that time, my partner in crime, [HistoryMaker] Robert Hooks, who's going on the road.  I mean we, you know, we, we, we had our objectives.  You know, we had, we, we had our objectives set out before we left.  And once again, our objective was act, act right.  We were going out to screw, screw the whole nation (laughter), I mean we, we (unclear) we, we, weren't thinking, but I think right.  We're going out to, to see what was out there for us to (laughter), to get.  Anyway, and then we had, there, there were all kinds of internal (laughter) cross relationships within the company and so forth that we already had had, that was, you know, all, all kinds of personal things going on. So we weren't, we weren't interested in no lecture about how, how we (laughter) were supposed to act right.

Speaker 1: And anyway, that was, that was, that was the week that we were in rehearsal here, and finally we left and went to Boston [Massachusetts].  And Elwood [Smith], we opened in Boston, and Elwood actually lived up to my, my, my, my ideal expectation in that he proved when we opened that, just what I thought, that he could be the, at that point, the best of the Walter Lees [Walter Lee Younger] who had played the role up until that time, in relation to Sidney [Poitier] and [HistoryMaker] Ossie [Davis].  We opened and he, he was, he was fantastic and got fantastic notices.  But--
Speaker 2: So once--but, go ahead.
Speaker 1: But, we weren't--'cause we, you know, Elwood had not--we, we were not, had not known Elwood that much, so we, we didn't know too much about him as, as, as, as, his, his character and, and problems or what have you.  But it, even while we were rehearsing in New York [New York], we started to become aware of the fact that he drank a lot, you know, but you know, sort of like flags went up.  But anyway, we, hey, we, we were all (laughter) hard drinkers or hard livers and so forth, so that didn't disturb us to (unclear) we opened and soon after we opened, we, you know, the shit hit the fan in a sense that, that something other than, than, than the show ['A Raisin in the Sun,' Lorraine Hansberry] was bothering him to the point.  And he began to, to, to, to reveal and reveal it through excessive, you know, drinking.  And suddenly, right after the show opened, the same, the same week that the show opened, two days later or something like that, we were faced with him being drunk.  Then it became our purpose, particularly the males in the company, all of us wanting to salvage him and the situation, we began to try to help him, you know, to the point where even, even during the day when we all would get together or something in somebody's room, you know, on the road, and he would--in the same hotel with him.  And we, we'd go by his place, or, or, or he'll come by wherever we were.  And we'd, we'd even try to drink with him, just to stop him from consuming (laughter), you know, the, the worst amount 'cause the show; by this time we're playing the show, and he had a show to do.  And this began the, the first week.  This is the pattern that was, was happening.  And, and ironically, it turned out that we lasted a week, and, and we sort of helped him and, and put a halt to, to his, the worst during that week.  And then we even, but we began to find out that his problem went beyond just the show, that he was having a problem with, with, with his at home, a wife he, it's he and wife were, were having problems, either she had put him out or what have you, or either he was trying to--because he kept talking about a situation with his, with his, with his affair and his wife and everything.  But anyway, we, the first week we, we tried to help him.  I mean I remember Bobby [HistoryMaker Robert Hooks] and I, we even tried to (laughter), I mean (unclear) wasn't Willie's wife, so we tried to find some (laughter), some fe- feminine companionship for him and shit.  And we thought we had, we'd succeeded at the end of the weekend and our day off.  And then, so we, we thought we had, we had bit the bullet, and we got him through; you know, we got him through, and he, he seemed to be all right.  There was some, some social event or some party we went to and seemed like he was all right.  We thought that we'd passed the crisis.
Story_ID: 276596
Speaker 1: We opened a second week, and he played, played, played, played the first, first performance [of 'A Raisin in the Sun,' Lorraine Hansberry] of the second weekend.  And they, you know five star reviews and everything, and he was wonderful.  The second, the next night, we were all gathered together, and [HistoryMaker] Robert [Hooks] and Lonne [Elder III] and so forth, we were all in the room.  And, and they had somewhere to go, and I'm, I was the only left in, in, in the hotel room that we were at.  And suddenly, he came by, and he had a quart of vodka.  And we said oh, Lord (laughter), we thought we had passed the point, and here we were in the worst--and he was, by this time it was, you know, like five, four, five o'clock in the afternoon and, and he was already drunk.  And so, so they, they had to do something and left me to take care of him (laughter).  Now, I'm his understudy and left me to take care of him.  I then decided that I'm gonna help him by not allowing him to drink (laughter) a whole quart.  I'm going to drink with him.  Anyway, I wound up even back in his own, in his own room, 'cause he's in the same hotel.  I wound up back there with him and trying to drink with him.  And then finally he got so drunk, and then, then he, then he turned a, turned against me viciously.  And he attacked me for, ironically, why was I in this show, that the management had messed over me by keeping me as an understudy and hiring him.  But what, why (laughter), and I'm saying what is, what is this going on?  This man is attacking me for--and I tried to explain to him, like, rationally: look, Elwood [Smith], I got no problem with, with understudying you.  I'm making, you know, whatever money, and that, that was my choice.  I got no problem with you, so that's not, the issue is not, you know, it's nothing between--but the issue was him.  Then he, then he attacked Claudia [McNeil].  Now, by this time, Claudia was acting like, like a, like the star, stupidly.  She's acting like a star and, and, and fucking with everybody (laughter) in a way that, and she giving him trouble, already had started out.  They only played a week, and she already giving him shit.  So, he, he then, like, started really viciously against her.  So between that--anyway, I thought I had at least drank enough with him for him to get through.  And then I finally, half drunk myself, left and went to eat by myself.  I'll never forget I went to Oyster House or something, right around the corner from the theater, and you know, had some oyster stew (laughter) or something by myself.  And then finally when, when half hour came, I sort of got up, and it was only a block and a half from the theater and sort of stumbled to the theater.  And when I got to the alley that led to the backdoor entrance, suddenly there was the company manager standing at the door and rushing towards me in the alley--, "Where were you, where?" I said, "What, what, what, what, what?"  And I said, "I'm not late, you know.  I mean it's still, you know, I'm, I'm here five minutes to a half hour."  He said, "No, you gotta go on."  (Laughter) And what? I'm say, "What, what, what?  I didn't hear right.  Gotta go?  What, what are you talking about? I gotta--."  "No, Elwood is in his hotel room, refuses to come out."  I said, "Well, send--." He said, "We already sent, we already the other actors to talk to him at this.  He refuses to come out."  (Laughter) And I'm here and I panic.  I said what do you mean?  Here I'm half drunk, and I gotta--first time I gotta (laughter) go on stage in this fucking role [Walter Lee Younger].  (Laughter) And I mean I'm trying to help him.  He won't come out, and I gotta go on for him.  And I'm not in a right stage to go on.  Anyway, make a long story short, he, he wouldn't, wouldn't come out, and, and, and I had to go on.  Now I had to go (laughter) on and from the first time, I mean irony of that.  I had to go on stage, and, and I, I'm half high myself, so I had to figure out strategies.  Thankfully--talking about craft and all that--thankfully, I was, I had enough craft, and I had enough consciousness to figure out a strategy, how I was gonna get through.
Story_ID: 276597
Speaker 1: What followed '[A] Raisin in the Sun' [Lorraine Hansberry] in your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In terms of me?
Speaker 1: --in your professional career.
Speaker 2: Well, after 'Raisin in the Sun' I, you know, came, came off the road after a year and then, then that's when, that's when I, I, as I said, I, it worked out that I had enough savings that I could concentrate on, on my writing.  And that's, during that period, after 'Raisin in the Sun,' is when I started writing 'Happy Ending' and 'Day of Absence' [Douglas Turner Ward], which became my first, first produced plays.  But acting-wise, soon as I got back and was, was prepared to, to concentrate on my writing, and I even had planned to, to go to Paris [France] and maybe stay for, you know, year, a couple of years and just concentrate on writing, but soon as I got back 'The Blacks[: A Clown Show]' was running.  And I went to see 'The Blacks' and, and I, I loved [Jean] Genet and the show, the, the play, and the, and the production.  I loved the play more than even the production.  But, anyway, lo and behold, [HistoryMaker] Roscoe Lee Browne was playing Archibald [Wellington].  The character, Archibald, was, was leaving to, for a while or something.  And the management--Sid Bernstein [Sidney Bernstein], I think was the, the, the, the producer--offered me the role.  I was so--since I played Walter Lee [Younger], a particular realistic role, and I was so in, so, so, so impressed with the style of, of 'The Blacks' and the challenge of the language.  And I felt that, that after playing or being in 'Raisin' for almost three years, that as an actor it would be helpful for me to challenge myself with something which I considered to be quote classical language, poetic languages and so forth.  And that, that, that would be a challenge for me after playing in, in, in, in, in, you know, in, in, in realistic conversational-type dialogue.  And so at the time I didn't need the monies, but the challenge of, the artistic challenge got me to, to, to do it.  Little did I know that they, they, once again, I was not gonna get any rehearsal, that suddenly they threw me--Roscoe, Roscoe left early, had to leave earlier than, than he was supposed to.  And, and, and I was, thought I had two or three weeks to learn, and suddenly I didn't.  I had to go (laughter) on like overnight, almost without having been rehearsed.  And I, you know, thankfully, I had by that time experience with 'Raisin.'  I mean, shit, I'd been on the road from, every week, opening every week, going from city to city, different theaters.  So I was, I was well prepared to jump into, to a situation with little notice and the same thing.  And all of this eventually helped me.  And that's why when people always look and say why is he able to direct himself, and I almost say the reason why I can direct myself is because even when (laughter) I was supposed to be directed by other people, I never got top--I always had to direct myself even when I was working for other people.  But anyway, I went into 'The Blacks' and did that for three, three or four months, you know, which brought, brought me into I think the--what it, 'The Blacks' I think was '61 [1961], you know, '61 [1961].  It was already running, 'cause I mean I think it opened in, I think it opened in '61 [1961].  I went into it in, in '61 [1961].  I stayed in about three, and then Roscoe came back.
Story_ID: 276598
Speaker 1: By that time, of, of that I'd, I'd personally become involved with, with, with Diana [Powell], you know, became my wife eventually, 'cause she lived right, right, right around the theater from, from, from the theater, the St. Mark's Playhouse [New York, New York].  And then after '[A] Raisin [in the Sun,' Lorraine Hansberry], getting involved with her, that (laughter), that, that squelched my plan about going, going to Paris [France].  And then, over the next two or three years, acting-wise, while I was around writing, I'm still now, basically I'm, I'm on the roll as far as the writing, and I finally completed the 'Happy Ending' and 'Day of Absence' [Douglas Turner Ward] during that, that, that period between 'Raisin' and, and up until three or four years.  I did those plays as a writer.  Then I got, I was in, in, in, once again in 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' as an understudy, the Kirk, Kirk Douglas production, the Broadway production of it.  I didn't need, need the money, didn't want, didn't need, need, need the work.  And I, reason why I was happy to be an understudy is because there were four black roles in the show, none of which (laughter), you know, were worthy of, of a acting challenge for me.  But, I must say, Kirk and them, they, they, they refused to let me refuse it.  I just kept asking for, look, I gave 'em, you know, a salary amount, thinking that I'm going to ask 'em for so much money they, they will stop bothering me.  And they said yes, (laughter) so I said shit yeah, man.  Nobody knew to this day.  The other actors in the show individually who were being, they didn't know that I was getting paid (laughter) more money as an understudy than they were, than they were getting.  And that was fine with me because that meant I didn't have to go on stage except in an emergency, in which ultimately happened, and I did have to go on stage and once the show opened in Broadway.  Then I did, I, I replaced Lou [HistoryMaker Louis Cameron Gossett, Jr.] in '[The] Blood Knot' [Athol Fugard] while it was running off-Broadway and then did it in Chicago [Illinois] and, and got, directed myself in it, pretty much in charge.  It got, got reviews that, that almost was the best reviews any actor for the whole year.  And it came around Christmastime, and they, they had to bring us back.  We were only supposed to do four or five performance, but the reviews were so great till he brought us back for sixteen more at the beginning of the, the, January.  In, and, and then, finally, I did, did, did something at Circle in the Square [New York, New York], the one that was downtown in, in, in, yeah, the Village [Greenwich Village, New York, New York].
Story_ID: 276599
Speaker 1: --What finally pulled you away from the acting into the writing (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, as, as, as you said, I did, I finished the plays and then between somewhere after I finished the plays, '63 [1963] to '64 [1964], we did readings of the play.  And there were attempts to see whether we could get it on.  I had a, had a, had a friend who, who was so enthusiastic, he, he tried to produce 'em.  They were done on, on, on WBAR [New York, New York] as radio shows.  In fact, Godfrey Cambridge was still alive then and, and, and, and read the, the main role in, in, in 'Day of Absence' [Douglas Turner Ward].  And so, com, combined with, with my acting then, I now have completed plays.  Also at that time, I'm helping Lonne [Elder III] with his own plays, which eventually came 'Ceremonies in Dark Old Men.'  I'm doing workshops of his play, directing and helping him to, to, to, to, to edit and write the plays and hopefully to get a production.  And actually, his plays came close to being produced before my plays.  After all of these efforts to get my plays done failed, I allowed Bobby, [HistoryMaker] Robert Hooks, who by this time had established his own workshop [Group Theater Workshop] using young actors, many of 'em who have become quite famous now, [HistoryMaker] Hattie Winston and, and Tony Fargas [Antonio Fargas], for instance, were in Bobby's workshop.  I allowed them to do the shorter of the two plays, one-act plays that I'd done, 'Happy Ending' [Douglas Turner Ward].  I allowed him to just use it as a, as an instruction at the end of the year.  After the kids had been instructed, I allowed him to use the play as, for their graduation (laughter), you know, performance.  Little did I know, that a New York [New York] critic, who's still a New York critic, he does a, he finally retired from mainstream publication, but he still writes for, for, for The Villager.  Jerry Tallmer--I didn't know--Jerry Tallmer was, was, was a, a, a second chair at the New York Post.  Jerry came without me knowing it and watched these kids in their, their, their graduation exercises, let's put it.  And I happened to be working in '[The] Blood Knot' [Athol Fugard] in Washington, D.C., so I was going back and forth, coming in on my day off and then going back for the week.  I happened to come in.  They'd done the, they'd done the production on that Sunday.  I didn't see it, the kids.  I came in on Monday.  Then I was going back to Washington on, on the train that, that Tuesday.  And I'm just leafing through the paper, and suddenly I come, come, come, come upon this page.  And the, the title of the page was "A Hilarious Play," which was hoo, hoo, hoo, you know, somebody written a hilarious play, and Jerry Tallmer's byline.  And then the first thing was 'Happy Ending,' and I said wait, wait (laughter) a minute.  And anyway, it turned out that he had come and then re- reviewed the play, forgetting about the fact that some amateur kids, you know, seventeen, eighteen years old, playing, you know, grown aunts and uncles and shit.  He ignored that and just dwelled with, with the, the, the, the, the quality of the play.  And suddenly, we (laughter) got this, this review in the main, one of the main New York papers.  That led Bobby to say Doug [HistoryMaker Douglas Turner Ward], we gotta, we gotta review for one of the play, and let me, let me produce the play.  Now Bobby is not--you know, I said Bob what have you, you know about a producer or anything?  No, man, let me, let me raise the money.  I made a deal with him.  I said Bob, if you get, if you can raise five thousand dollars, then I'll, then we can, you know, we'll sign a real contract.  But I'm not gon' put a burden on you to sign a contract for you to produce these plays when, when I, you know, it's a shot in the dark.  You're not a producer.  This--anyway, he did raise the five thousand dollars, which say that we went ahead.  And little did I know that, that almost that was all that he, he, he raised, and we still needed fifteen thousand dollars more.
Speaker 1: Fifteen?
Speaker 2: But--fif- yeah, it was the, the production was scheduled for, for a budget of twenty thousand dollars.  Anyway, he maybe came up with five more, but we still lacked ten, ten more.  Anyway, my friend, another friend, the one who was responsible for me--I think I've already talked about him--getting into '[The] Iceman Cometh,' [Eugene O'Neill] Philip, Philip Meister.  Phil was directing the play, and Phil had his own company, the National Shakespeare Company.  So when Bobby couldn't raise the money, Phil was prepared to lend money to get the production on since we were already in rehearsal, and that's what happened.  We got the production to rehearsal, and we finally opened.
Story_ID: 276600
Speaker 1: When, as I said, Phil [Philip Meister], we had, Phil helped us get--
Speaker 2: You had raised ten thousand (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: --of the twenty you needed.
Speaker 1: And then, then we, ha, didn't raise much more, but, but we were able to get the production on.  In fact, I remember we almo- we were ready to run out of money for the last week of rehearsal.  And that's when Phil said look, this, his work, 'cause he's directing the two plays, and his work and our work; I'm, I'm acting in 'em, you know, and so forth.  And by that time, it, it was, it was gonna be too frustrating to have to stop after we'd gotten that far.  So he then, that's when he came in and, and, and wait, were gonna lend the money to pay the actors for the last week.  We already had rented the theater, so.  Anyway, we, we pretty much were broke by the time opened, which meant that we could damn near close the next day 'cause we (laughter), they really didn't have any, much money.  We'd got enough money to open, but we didn't have enough money to pay for the first week.  But by that time we were, we were pre-selling the show, according to my, my, my approach, 'cause I was determined that the two plays ['Happy Ending' and 'Day of Absence,' Douglas Turner Ward], I was not interest, ever interested in my plays being produced to just a conventional theater audience, you know.  I felt that as a writer, my real breakthrough as a writer, and [Jean] Genet in particular, along with [Bertolt] Brecht were responsible for that, is that when I decided that I was writing for an ideal public, and that ideal public were other black folks.  I wasn't interested; I mean in, in my plays when I, as a writer, consciously address myself to a black public, that was my, that was my freedom.  That's when I could write freely.  That's when I didn't have to write to, to explain and educate at the same time, 'cause you know, I, I, I'd had enough experience with white audiences to know that, you know, they, they, they need to be educated at, sometimes at the same time.  And a good write--you don't have to, you know, you don't have--you, you, you want to imply; you want to suggest.  You want to trust the fact that they're gonna get it because they bring enough of their own experience to it.  But when you gotta explain it and explain what, you know, that's, that's, that leads to bad writing.  And I felt that I had made a breakthrough when I consciously said okay, even a black public doesn't exist on a regular basis, I'm gonna write as if it does.  Then once we decided to do the plays, I convinced Bobby [HistoryMaker Robert Hooks]: "Bobby, we got to go out and get the audience.  They're not gon' come just throughout there."  New York [New York], you know, black folks don't know shit about The New York Times or review or the ad.  So, before the show is open, we went around to the trade union hall, to local 1199 [SEIU Healthcare 1199], to 65, to, to the social clubs, to the churches uptown and everything to get, you know, to get, to get the black public.  And once we opened, that public wasn't necessarily, didn't, we didn't start with the majority black, black public, but we had a sufficient amount for word of mouth to immediately spread.
Story_ID: 276601
Speaker 1: And, and just as I felt, you know, the black, the black audience just, just flipped over the plays; you know, I mean the two plays, 'Happy Ending' and ['Day of Absence,' Douglas Turner Ward] both of them, but, but, but particularly 'Happy Ending,' the shorter one.  At first they, they thought I was telling secrets, 'cause you know, these two maids and how, and how they maneuvered to outmaneuver that employer in term, terms of finance, you know.  I mean they thought, well, may, maybe, maybe white people shouldn't know this, you know, let 'em know we, we, (laughter) we, we, we ahead of them and, and, and, and so forth.  But then, but then them plays were so funny, that, that they just gave up, said, "Ah, go on and tell 'em and, and (laughter) let the chips fall away more."  And they just laughed and fell in the aisle and so forth.  So anyway, even though we opened broke, you know, with nothing in the till, we were able to immediately get a public that allowed us, at least in the early stages, to get through, at least to pay the, pay the actors and sustain the rent for the shows until it built up.  And what happened is accumulation in terms of the mainstream audience and public and, and the reputation of the show began to develop because the accumulation of reviews began, you know, to be, to be so, so, so positive.  And particularly, as, as I remember at that time, we had to, we still had seven New York [New York] papers.  The New York Times review--
Speaker 2: So what date did the show actually open in--
Speaker 1: The show, on the 14th of November--
Speaker 2: In--
Speaker 1: --1965 [sic. November 15, 1965], right.
Speaker 2: --in which theater, St. Marks?
Speaker 1: St. Mark's Playhouse [New York, New York], right.  But anyway, as I said, New York Times sort of was a lukewarm review and sort of an ignorant review 'cause he didn't, he, he didn't know what he was (laughter)--
Speaker 2: What did he say?
Speaker 1: I don't, I don't even remember.  It's just was that it was, you know, it was like sort of I don't know.  There were, there were so many, there were so many positive reviews that were, that, even, even good reviews that were ignorant; as I said, the critics were ignorant.  Like, I, I remember one critic said that the 'Happy Ending' was about how Harlem [New York, New York] survived on the wages of its domestics.  And the play is just the opposite.  Ha, my, the whole point of the play is that if all--if the domestic had to depend on their wages, they'd be (laughter), they'd be in the, in, in the poorhouse.  But it was like their, their extra (laughter) machinations that, that caused them to live pretty good, you know.  But in, anyway, the accumulation of those notice and particularly the, the, the, The New Yorker, The New Yorker and I think at that point Life magazine.  I forgot who, who, who, who, the names of the critics.  But those, those, those, those notices, the magazine reviews in particular were glowing notices.  The, the daily papers had been mixed, some, some, you know, enthusiastic, some lukewarm, some didn't know what the fuck they were looking at.  But, as I said, at that time the accumulation of notices you could build up--
Story_ID: 276602
Speaker 1: So let's, since we are going to have to continue, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --another day, let's go back a little and talk about the process of you creating the two plays.  You said that the, the, the thread line of the thought for the plays themselves were germinating in your head when you were working on '[A] Raisin in the Sun' [Lorraine Hansberry], or you, you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well--
Speaker 1: --or gestating, you said (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, gestating at that point.  'Day of Absence' [Douglas Turner Ward] which was the, the first play that I wrote of the pair, 'Day of Absence,' not only was gestating, but 'Day of Absence' actually, the roots and thread of, of, of, of, of, of that, that play came all, went all the way back to my, my, my time when I was, when I was working on, on, on the, on the newspaper, when I was working at the Daily Worker and, and made a trip at the time of the bus boycott, which was I think '56 [1956]--
Speaker 1: Fifty, the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The mon, Montgomery Bus Boycott.
Speaker 1: --fifty-five [1955].
Speaker 2: Fifty-five [1955], fifty, somewhere--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in that year.  It ran, I think ran into the--so, whatever, I went home to New Orleans [Louisiana] to, to visit, you know, my parents [Dorothy Short Ward and Roosevelt Ward, Sr.] then.  And, and on the way back, you know, I purposefully stopped over in Montgomery [Alabama] on the train and, and to stay through, throughout the day; I mean it was like I got off the train, and there was gonna be another train later on that evening or some, somewhere.  So I was able to get off when they got to Montgomery from New Orleans and the, then spend the rest of the day in, in, in Montgomery and still, still catch another train that would bring me back to New York [New York].  That, when, when, when I saw the, the, the, the, the pattern of, of what was going on, 'cause I stayed, went there.  Basically, I, you know, it wasn't a, nowhere to stay, but I just went there and went immediately to the, the bus stop terminal where the buses stopped and also people were being picked up by, the black people being picked up by cars and so forth.  So I went to where the, the center, downtown area, and I stayed there for hours watching what went on.  And what finally--the, these buses that kept rolling in empty, and it was almost like, you know, the authorities were still pretending that things were normal.  Now, by the time I went there, it was, it was way into the bus thing wasn't at the right beginning, so this, now it, the pattern of, of, of behavior on, on both sides.  The buses were still running, pretending that life was the same.  And by this time, the carpools were, were actively, you know, in force on a regular basis.  But these buses that kept running through empty and them pretending that, that, that there an- somebody to pick up when there was nobody, that seemed to me bizarre and, and, and ridiculous.  You know, you're talkin' about theater of (laughter), the absurd, you know, theater, the, the ab- absurd.  I thought, I said wait a minute: I don't have to go back to New York and, and, and, and quibble with my, my fellow white writers, imitating the European ad- avant-garde when their theater absurd.  Here is real absurdity.  You know, this is realistic absurdity.  And I tried to, at first, when I got back took a while to gestate.  And then I tried to, to, to, to, to, to deal with this image of these empty buses.  I tried to write it as a short story.  And I got quite far into it, and somewhere along the line it didn't work.  You know, whatever I was--the short story form was not working, and I just, just abandoned it. So, what I'm saying here, that was almost the initial thing, and what, fifty--'56 [1956], by, by '61 [1961], '62 [1962], you know '62 [1962], whatever I said after 'Raisin,' it had (laughter), it had, it had gestated.  It had gestated for those years, and suddenly I work up and then it sounds, you know, sounds fictional in a way, you know, or excessively dramatic.  But it was true that I did, I woke up one morning and suddenly said oh shit, that, the reason why it didn't is it's not a, it, it's not a short story.  And then for some reason I said why did I try to write a short story when I already was a dramatist?  But for some reason I didn't try to deal with it.  It didn't occur to me about the, writing it as a drama, 'cause I said it's a play.  And then once, once, once I say it's a play, I essentially sat down and wrote 'Day of Absence' in, in, in, in a week.  I mean it wasn't like I had to pover- over it, wonder over it, you know, worry over writing it.  It wrote itself almost.  I mean boom, I, once I, once I say it's a play, and from that point, boom, it just came out, you know, in one fell swoop, and, and, and, and it wrote itself, as I said.
Story_ID: 276603
Speaker 1: Then when I finished it ['Day of Absence,' Douglas Turner Ward], at that time, it was almost like--American theater, in order to have a full evening, you damn near almost had to have at least two and a half hours, you know, and even, even three.  I mean rai, '[A] Raisin in the Sun,' [Lorraine Hansberry] was, was, is, is, is two and a half hours, I mean in terms of with intermission and everything I think close to three hours.  But that was, you know, two-act plays at that time, hey, that was the norm, a two-act play, a three-act play, I think.  Is 'Raisin' in three?  I think 'Raisin' may be in three acts, but that was the norm.  So when I finished and it was only not too much over an hour, and I might have, you know, might have been, at production-wise you might stretch it to, to, to hour and twenty minutes, I said I need a companion piece.  And then when I said I gotta provide it with a companion piece, I just thought through my, my mind and what, what, what, what, what the, what else that would fit the, the, the, the genre, 'cause this, this was satire.  I didn't need to write a quote another quite satire as formalistic and as, as innovative as, as this was and in order to, the way it emerged, you know, with the, with, with, with the triple mammy, of the white face and all of that.  I mean this was, this is, this is Brechtian combined with [Jean] Genet, combined with me almost in stylistic form.  I didn't need to, to, to imitate, but I needed something comedic.  And that, and suddenly I, I, and then I said oh, I know, I know, the threat of the idea; I know what happened.  And then another image occurred to me of my aunt, who had died.  And all of us, when we gathered the night, not the day of the funeral, but the night, the, the, she had a thing at, at the home of, of, of the funeral home with the, with the society she belonged to, the women's society she belonged to and so forth, even though she was a Catholic.  And we had to keep the priest out 'cause they ain't supposed to be doing that, with her, her sisters marching in their uniforms and all (laughter), whatever that society was.  But I, I remember her being in the casket, and I remember her old employer, this woman who was her employer, coming and looking into the casket crying, you know, simp- in, in, in tears over my aunt's casket.  And the, and the family, we were sitting on the front row, all of us sitting on the front, front, first to rows.  And we watched this, this, this white woman.  It was her employer, come there crying all, and all of us look, looking at each other because what the woman didn't recognize is that my aunt was laid out resplendently in that woman's gown.  You know how black folk tell I'm going t oa lay 'em out like they're asleep?  Well, we (laughter), we had literally laid out my aunt in this, I mean this, this rich gown that had been, been, been usurped from this woman before she even (laughter) knew she had it I guess.  And that was, that was the nature of the play, about like both, both the woman and, and particularly her husband, the clothes that used to be delivered to him, he didn't know that (laughter) they were, we were wearing 'em before he even got 'em.  He never even knew he had 'em, to a certain extent, except by sight sometimes, because I had to one time, my aunt came and told me I had to give, I had to get, get, give the suit back because he, he, he asked about it, you know, and so forth.  But anyway, in fact, that's in the play.  The thing I couldn't get in, in, in, in the play was this, this nightgown, the real scene 'cause both of the aunts are still alive while the play is happening.  And that always disturbed--I said how am I gonna get in this gown 'cause that, that was the most fantastic (laughter) moment of, of us looking at this woman and keeping a straight face as this woman looked in the coffin and didn't recognize (laughter) that my aunt was laid out in her gown.  That idea, I said no, I gotta follow through.  And once, once that image and that moment came to me, then I said okay.
Story_ID: 276604
Speaker 1: And then the idea of another episode with my aunt that similarly in that once the--something happened and my, my aunts will express an undue behavior, un- sympathetic behavior or crying.  They weren't crying, but they were in a gloomy state over these people, their employers.  And what it turned out is that, that, that the husband was finally divorcing her.  You know, she, she, the, the white woman they worked for was a fuckup; I mean she was messing around.  And finally, he put up with, and my aunt's always shake, shook the head over her.  But finally, it got too much for him, and he decided he was gonna divorce her.  But he didn't have, but she had no money.  She didn't have no money.  He had the money.  So my aunts--I didn't get the point right way, see, and that's why the, the play turned out like it was.  I, I wrote the germ of the idea of 'Happy Ending' [Douglas Turner Ward] is because of me not getting the point right away of why they were gloomy.  I misinterpreted it, thinking that they were shor- they were being like Aunt Jemima, being Uncle Tom, you know, worrying over that white folk, when we shouldn't, you know, the hell with them, fuck the white people.  We don't, we shouldn't be--that's their business; we shouldn't have anything to do--but, I didn't get the point.  I got it maybe two minutes into--before I could say anything to them, I got it and therefore I didn't say anything.  But what I did with the play is I treated it as it's suppose--I had not gotten a, the point and then said what I, how I felt in my first, the first moment of my, my cat--seeing them in this, this state.  What would I have said to them if I was gonna call them (laughter) Aunt Jemimas, you know.  And then if you read it, 'Happy Ending,' that's all it is, is that finally he comes in and finds them in, in that state, and then he goes off, especially with his militancy.  At that point, you know, it's a, 19--the '60s [1960s], the '60s [1960s].  I mean this is, this is, this--so he was, he went off on his, his tirade almost with them, and they finally realized that, that he did, you know, he didn't get the, he then, even know he's benefitting from the largess that they provided from this, this, this rich white man that suddenly he--they thought he was, was smart enough to know why they were gloomy, because if this man divorced this woman, they were not gonna need (laughter) them to work, 'cause both of 'em--one of 'em, the aunt who eventually da, died, worked one day a week, you know, with the clothes.  And the other one was the regular, you know, taking care household, so she was, she was a real manipulator.  But I wrote the play because I--as, as if my dumbness, my first instant of dumbness.  I just carried it through and had 'em, had, had him--Junie is the character--just, just run off at the mouth about why are they worried about these white folks.  And they finally have to say since he didn't get it, we have to tell it to him in a way that we will make sure he gets it.  He doesn't seem to get it quickly, so we have to lay it out (laughter), you know, step by step.  And that, those two things, the, the image of the, the, (laughter) my aunt in the coffin and my own reaction when I found them gloomy about the potential divorce, caused me to then write 'Happy Ending.'  So the, those, that was the genesis of those two, two plays.
Story_ID: 276605
Speaker 1: So how did that, I mean the 1965 opening, St. Mark's Place [St. Mark's Playhouse, New York, New York], you said led, led to the, the NEC [Negro Ensemble Company]--
Speaker 2: Oh, the, the, the whole, the whole, all of the, the, the, the factors, all of the factors that went into 'Happy Ending' and 'Day of Absence' [Douglas Turner Ward]--
Speaker 1: Which were?
Speaker 2: --turned out to be the germs, the germ, the full-fledged germ of what became the NEC every, every element of it: a black-produced play, [HistoryMaker] Robert Hooks, a black producer, a black writer who's written about the black experience to say, addressed to a black audience, and a company, a 99 percent black company, which includes the veteran actors, 'cause I hired, you know, I had Frances Foster, you know, Moses Gunn, Robert, of course, was, was, was in it 'cause Robert played Junie in the orig- original production and also everybody was, of course, the four of us in, in, in, in 'Happy Ending' were all in, in, in 'Day of Absence,' 'cause 'Day of Absence' had about thirteen people I think, and, but Bobby's group, Bobby's workshop group [Group Theater Workshop], the kids who had trained, the ones I said that originally did 'Happy Ending' in that, in that graduation ceremony.  They were also, so I got the generations, all of the, the veterans, the younger generation who were developing, who had also been, been part of a training program.  So all of these things became the model.  By putting together, in putting together NEC, eventually it didn't take--we, we sat down at the, at, at Orquidea [New York, New York], the, the bar right on the corner from the theater, at that time on 9th [Street] 9th and 2nd Avenue.  When we found that we were, we were invited to make a proposal, a full-scale proposal, we sat down, and on a napkin (laughter), I mean on a, on a theater cloth, the white cloth in, over the, over the table, sat down and, and, and almost quickly outlined the ingredients for the NEC, the training program, the professional company, the, you know, the theater, the ambition for the productions, and as I said, the training program, which, which was, was thorough, or, and, and, and, and, and, and my insistence that all of this had to be free.  See, all of, all of the NEC, all of the training that the NEC did was tuition-free.  Nobody paid us a dime for, for, for the--it was a full-scale training because, hey, we, you know.  I, I, just to show the training program, Paul Mann was, was, was--I brought Paul Mann in to train the theater company for, for a compressed intensive period of time before they, before they did the first production at a three-month paid, just like actors being paid, paid on a regular basis.  Once I selected the company, they started a training program, and they were being paid full-scale salaries, you know, to come in every day.  Paul trained them.
Story_ID: 276606
Speaker 1: I created the advanced training program, which ironically wound up with actors who are now in the hall of fame even more than--like, for instance, at, at the recent, two weeks ago, two three weeks ago, what, at Lloyd's [HistoryMaker Lloyd Richards] memorial, Mary Alice, you know, who won the Tony [Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Theatre] for, for, for 'Fences' [August Wilson] got up and, and talking about her homage to Lloyd, basically said, talked about me, thanking me for bring (laughter), bringing her to Lloyd, 'cause she was part of that, that advanced training program.  And what it was is, hey, Dave (unclear) was in Chicago [Illinois], and, and we did a production in Chicago.  And Mary Alice then was a young, young woman working as a teacher or something and came and worked on the, on, on the staff as, as, as, in, in, backstage as, as the, the, the clothe- you the, the, the costume department while she understudied, you know, a couple of the roles.  And I talked to her, and she wanted to be an actress.  And I told her at that point that if she came to New York [New York], that I'd look out for her.  And eventually she moved to New York, and put her in the training.  That's why she got up at the, at Lloyd's memorial and was thanking me or creating the training program that I hired Lloyd to be over.  And Lloyd, Lloyd was in there, and 'Shaft.'  Richard Roundtree was in that, that, that program.  Even people who dit- who, who, who didn't go into acting like, like Susan, [HistoryMaker] Susan Taylor, you know, who was the editor of, of Essence was in that program.  I, sometimes I even look at the yellow sheet with their, their attendance records (laughter).  You know, I, I still have, have little marks where they, they, with the mark on their attend- attendance.  So, basically, 'Happy Ending' and 'Day of Absence' [Douglas Turner Ward] had all of the components that made it almost easy for us to expand it into this rounded, you know, ten times larger scale continuous permanent sort of theater program.  Now, that, I was able to also do that because of what I said to you earlier.  It turns out (laughter) that even when I was--I don't--before I was out of my teens, that the LYL [Labor Youth League], the organization that Lorraine [Hansberry] and I belonged to that put out this, this, this, this, this magazine for two, three issues called Challenge and I think Lorraine had a, had a, had a, had a some, something, had poetry or something in that same issue, which I have to eventually go back and look at.  It might be in The Tamiment Library [& Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives] at, you know, NYU [New York University, New York, New York] with the radical stuff.  It was a LYL organ. Somebody came up to me in, while I was on the road with, with, with one of the shows.  I think it was, was the, and in California, and a lady handed me this, this, this, this, this, this envelope.  And in it was, was this article that was, was this sheet of, of this, this little magazine, you now, little--and in it was, was this article for me calling for black, a black per- black permanent black theater.  And I said oh shit, I'd, I'd forgotten that I had began to develop those ideas that eventually fleshed out as the NEC [Negro Ensemble Company] twenty something (laughter) years later almost.  But it was what I said before.  All of this, as you know, the source of all of this became by my early, you know, my early participation in the left-wing movement, where these articles of autonomy and, and my favorite words, hegemony, autonomy, self-determination.  All of these things came early to me.  So, later on in life, when I matured, I was able to put 'em in, into practical shape and so forth, and that was, that was basically--'Happy Ending' and 'Day of Absence,' that production gave us the opportunity to do that.  Now, of course, the success of the production was key in a sense that it led to interests by the Ford Foundation [New York, New York].  The production succeeded in the same way I talked about, all of the ingredients.  Suddenly, when Ford was interested in supporting some black venture, independent venture, and, and suddenly there it was.  [W.] McNeil Lowry picked up the paper and, and, and read a, read the success of this production, and they wanted to speak to the people who put this production on, 'cause it, it, you know, it was, it was, it was--we got the notices.  That's one good thing about the mainstream positive thing.  I mean I'm, you know, I'm cynical about the mainstream understanding of many of our ventures, but, but, but pragmatically, we know what it can do in terms of careers, individually or group-wise.
Story_ID: 277213
Speaker 1: 'Day of Absence' [Douglas Tuner Ward] seemed to be, to represent on a lot of levels, and [Paul Laurence] Dunbar's poem is, you know, 'We Wear the Mask' on some level, 'cause of black folks, you know, portraying, you know, or imitating the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, the, the thing with, with 'Day of Absence,' since I've, I've already probably explained in the genesis of it in the sense that it, really, the play bai- basically inspired by my visit to Montgomery [Alabama] during the Montgomery Bus Boycott.  And you know I'm from New Orleans [Louisiana], and, and, and I had been living in New York [New York] for years and, but I used to go back, visit home regularly.  So I went to New Orleans during the bus boycott period.  And I said I can't--you know, you can't, you know, you an ex-journalist.  I, I cannot, you know, I'm not assigned, but I gotta, you know, I gotta see, look history in, in, in the face, so I--on my way back 'cause the, the root from, between New York and, and, and, and New Orleans is, is--Montgomery is almost like one of the last stops before you get to New Orleans going, come, going south and one of the first stops leaving New Orleans, coming back north.  And so I'm, you know, got on the train, and, and, and stopped over, and said ooh, I'll catch, you know, I'll catch another train (laughter) later and so forth, but I just wanted to observe.  So anyway, but when I went there, it was in the midst, it was--the, the boycott had been going on for quite a while.  It was like six, seven months now, so I mean everything was routine and regular.  Ev- everything had been set up; the, you know, all of the, the alternative transportation, all of these were done.  But the thing that was, was still continued is that the bus, the buses, those classic, you know, buses that we all know about, in terms that Rosa Parks started by being defiant and so forth, they were still running the route, a natural route, as if noth- nothing had changed, but there was nobody on it.  And they stopped, they'd, you know, stop at every stop (laughter), empty as a--and this was, this was just absurd you know.  And my sense of irony and absurdity is always, you know, part of, part of my, my, my creative streak anyway.  But here was real life; (laughter) I mean, it was the absurdity of real life.  I said this has got to be crazy.  So anyway, this stuck with me, this image, just this image of the empty buses.  And it occurred to me: I said oh, I, I gotta do something with, with, with it, and I tried to treat it first as, as a short story primarily.  And I, you know, got about two, two, two-thirds of the way finished and I, and it just didn't work.  So I put it, you know, put the material aside, and you know, that was it.  But about a year or so later, after my first attempt to, to turn in a short story, I woke up one, one, one morning or night or what have you and, and said I know why it didn't work.  It's not a short story; it's a play.  And immediately the, the, the, the play wrote, wrote itself, because suddenly, the idea of the empty, empty buses led to, to, to me saying well, okay, suppose it wasn't just people riding the bus.  Suppose all, suppose it went to the ultimate extreme and all of the blacks.  It's almost like a, a strike, and they, they vanish.  And, and the idea of, of them vanishing and the repercussions on the city, the little, you know, a city the size of Montgomery.  I said okay, how do the white people react, you know, to this?  And that, that, of course, set me on, and then my, my, my aesthetic and my Brechtian training and philosophy in, in terms of theater, Brechtian approach to theater, just made me say okay, but let's take it to the ultimate extreme.  Let's not just have--let's have the people who disappear really still be here behind the mask, but now they (laughter)--they, they will be representing the white folks.  And that's when the idea of the, the white face came up, a combination of factors of course.  As I said, my Brechtian streak but the other thing is like the reverse minstrel show.  I said I'm go, I'm, I'm going (laughter), I'm going to do a rebellion against the, the form of the minstrel show by (laughter) taking it to its ultimate extreme--
Story_ID: 277214
Speaker 1: Had NEC [Negro Ensemble Company] done, what's that, 'The Blacks: A Clown Show' [Jean Genet] by, by this time?  I know that was done (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'The Blacks' had already been done, independently.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, the 'The Blacks' had been, in fact, all of us had been in--'Blacks' were like our university, in a sense.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) For--
Speaker 1: --he was a--
Speaker 2: --especially the black actors, 'cause for five years 'Blacks' ran on, in the same theater [St. Mark's Playhouse, New York, New York] the NEC ultimately was housed in.  'Blacks' ran there for five years.  I mean, actually, I came off the road with '[A] Raisin in the Sun' [Lorraine Hansberry] after being the road on 'Raisin in the Sun' for a year.  And 'The Blacks' had already opened and that June or July or somewhere.  And by the time I got back, it was already running.  And then [HistoryMaker] Roscoe Lee Browne, Roscoe Lee Browne, the late, now the late Roscoe Lee Brown was playing Archibald [Wellington], the chara- one of the central characters in the play.  And he left that, that, around September or October somewhere later in run.  And I had come back and, and ultimate replaced him after he left, so I was in 'The Blacks' in the early stage.  There were people in, in, in 'The Blacks' five years later who I didn't even know.  They said oh, I was in 'The Blacks.'  I said oh, you were in 'The Blacks'?  (Laughter) I say you, you're the latter, latter-day blacks, I mean 'cause, anyway, 'The Blacks' had already (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Just like a who's who.  I think ev- Cicely--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, remember, every actor is--
Speaker 1: --Tyson [Cicely Tyson]--
Speaker 2: Oh, abso- no, the, as I said, it was sort of like, like our training period, program almost, 'cause almost every black actor in New York [New York] eventually was in it one way or the other, as I said, at different, different times, so that, that was the case.  But, no, the, 'Day of Absence' [Douglas Turner Ward] was, was open in '65 [1965], you know.  And what happened is, after I wrote the play and finished the play and so forth, at that point in that time, theater still--you almost needed, needed, needed two, two and a half to three hours of theater, and I, so I say oh, it's too short to, to, to be done by itself.  You'd probably get away with now plays, you know, you get eighty-minute plays and so forth.  But at that time, you need, you need, you needed almost twice as much for a full evening. So then I wound up saying I need a companion piece.  I searched through my mind, and I frankly come up with an idea of something that would be, be compatible with it.  And I, and 'Happy Ending' [Douglas Turner Ward] emerged and, and from that.  'Happy Ending' really was based on, on the real life relationship to, with me and my, my aunts.  I always call it, 'Happy Ending' a valentine to my, my, my two, my two conniving aunts (laughter), you know.  And once again, it was a reverse of, of, of the mammy sentiment I mean, 'cause it turned (laughter) out that they were, they were not mammies, you know, and so forth.  But anyway, that, my relationship with them had been to the point where I knew immediately when I saw them brooding and being sorrowful about something.  When they told me, I immediately knew that, that, you know, their own self-interest probably was the, the, the reason for their brooding.  But my instinct first, when they showed, showed this, this, this sort of heartfelt things for these white folks, I mean I got mad.  You know, my, you know, militant instinct and all that shit, I, I almost said well, you know, I wanted to say, "Why you worried about these white folks?"  But I knew better.  I knew them better, so I, I didn't say anything, 'cause my mind immediately grasped intuitively to a certain that no, they, the, the, the, whatever mood they're in it's not about (laughter) the white folks, about them in some way.  But the idea in terms of writing a play is I then took this moment of thought of me thinking about them being Aunt Jemimas, I took that moment of thought and said okay, suppose I create this character and he don't, he don't get it, and he, and he runs with it and actually articulate to them his idea about them being (laughter) Aunt Jemima and what would happen.  And that's how, you know, suddenly the whole play revolves around the fact that they have to get him straight because they, they thought he understood.  But when they found out that he was dumb, too dumb, they had to remind him (laughter), bring him up to date about his own self-interest being served by their working for these white folks and managing these (laughter) white--creatively managing the household.
Story_ID: 277215
Speaker 1: You know, it seems like both, both plays are about revelation, what black people are really thinking about.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: And (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, it the irony about when blacks first came to play, they, they almost, for a while, they almost, they were, they were, they were almost uptight about 'Happy Ending' [Douglas Turner Ward] 'cause they felt I was giving away too many secrets.  But the play is just so, just so hilarious till they gave up and said okay.  I mean he giving away the secret, but this, they, they, they fell out in the aisle.  I mean the, the play just was too, too hilarious.
Speaker 1: How, how did white people react to 'Happy Ending,' I mean the, you know?
Speaker 2: 'Happy Ending' was much threat to the northern public in particular.  'Happy Ending' was much more threatening.  You know, 'Day of Absence' [Douglas Turner Ward] was wonderful and theatrical, and it had so many elements that--
Speaker 1: They could laugh at the southern whites, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, the southern whites and also the forum and, and theatricality of it everything, you could, you could get involved in, in, in the thea- theater aspect of it.  No, 'Happy Ending' is, is, is straight out.  You know, ain't no, there are no thea- theatrical fireworks or nothing like (laughter), you know.  So you get it, and that was much more threatening.  They, they--you could see the, the uptight jaws about that.  I used to laugh because of the public for, for, for--the reaction I play, of course, to black folks, as I said, laying in the aisle by then.  Young white folks were not threatened as, but, you know, the younger generation wasn't threatened.  They, they laughed along with us.  And it was strange: there was a bunch of nuns who, who came, and they were laughing at it.  So for a while I said wait a minute, these white nuns, why, why they, they, why are they, they, they laughing?  Then I realized, I said oh I see: they don't have any self-interest.  They've opted out of (laughter) the whole sex, you know, marriage game, so they can sit back and laugh at the idea of this nymphomaniac white woman, you know, and so forth, 'cause they, they've committed themselves to, to being God's or (laughter) God's wife, so they're not (laughter) interested in the moral peccadilloes of the, the, you know, the real flesh and blood people.   So they, they could sit back and, and, and have a distance to--and, and find it, find a, a la- laughter.  That is, that was a very interesting--but anyway, those, that's basically how those two plays emerged and, and, and so forth--
Story_ID: 277216
Speaker 1: Once I wrote 'em, we spent, you know, a couple of years almost trying to get 'em done independently.  And one way or the other, and I had, you know, people who died to get 'em done, but, but for one reason or another couldn't get the money.  And finally, Bobby, [HistoryMaker] Robert Hooks, had, had, had developed this, this young group, training these young, young, young potential actors.  In fact, out of that group emerged later on [HistoryMaker] Hattie Winston, of course, and, and, and Huggy Bear, Tony Fargas [Antonio Fargas]--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --came out of that group that--
Speaker 2: --Antonio Fargas.
Speaker 1: --that, that group that Bobby developed.  And when, when it--af- after they had been in, been, been in, been, been taught for, for, for, for months, he wanted to show off the result, so he had an evening where he was gonna show like an exercise of the graduation thing.  And he asked me to do 'Happy Ending' [Douglas Turner Ward].  Let, let the kids do 'Happy Ending.'  So I let him, let him do 'Happy Ending,' just the, the, the young, young, young--they, no, nobody in, in, in the group of more than eighteen years old almost.  And I happened to be working in, in Washington [D.C.] in, in '[The] Blood Knot' [Athol Fugard] in performing, so I wasn't in town when the, the, the Sunday that, that, that they did the, the, the performance.  But lo and behold, I came in town my day off, Monday, and I was going back to Washington to resume performance that Tuesday.  I bought the New York Post, the paper, daily paper, and I, you know, flipped through it and then came to the, the entertainment section.  And suddenly I saw this headline say hilarious plays or something.  I said oh, I wonder who, who, what, what, who, who, you know, who's, who's come, come up with, with a hilarious play.  And, and immediately I saw, and it was like 'Happy.'  I said wait (laughter), wait a minute.  And to make a long story short, Jerry Tallmer, who was one of the, the leading critics from the, for the Post, had originally been on The Village Voice, Jerry had went just to check out, you know, this, this evening with these, these, you know, these, these, these, these amateur kids, and saw the thing, and wrote this review of the play, almost ignoring the fact that it, that none of the kids were, were old enough or professional enough yet.  But he just concentrated on the play itself as being (laughter), you know, the one of the funniest things.  So anyway, that gave Bobby, after he, he got this, this review already in a major paper, gave him the courage, said, "But Doug [HistoryMaker Douglas Turner Ward], why don't you let me try to see if I can do it?"  Anyway, make, make everything brief, I said, "Look, Bob, if you can wound up, if you can--," I forgot the, the amount of money, but I said, "look, if you, if you--if you can prove that you can raise X amount of money before I even get into dealing with contractually, see if you can raise a certain amount of money.  And if you can raise that money, then we, we can go ahead and, and plan.  You, you, you got it; you're the producer."  And of course, he went out and, and between all of us contributing our own, out our own pockets and so forth, he came with (laughter), with, with a minimum amount I needed.  But I always laugh because he came up with the minimum amount and didn't much go farther.  (Laughter) So by the time we were ready to commit--I'm casting and all, and all of that--we still didn't have the, the budget.  But by that time, it was, it was too late to not do it.  And I had a friend who, who had his own theater group, and he had, you know, he had--actually I wound up being, being the person who directed the, the, the two productions.  But he and I had been great friends from drama school [Paul Mann Actor's Workshop] and gave me my first job at the Circle in the Square [Theatre, New York, New York] when I, when I first did my first professional job in '[The] Iceman Cometh,' [Eugene O'Neill] Philip Meister.  So Phil, Phil had his own group, the Shakespearean [National Shakespeare Company], which was basically a touring group.  But he, he had his, you know, he had, he had money in his till.  So we protected--we didn't let Bobby know that when we, when we were at, rer- rehearsal, that there was not enough money to pay the last week of rehearsal, so we, we protected ourselves and never told Bobby.  I don't think I still (laughter), I don't think I told that to, tell, ever told Bobby that we had the money filled--we'll, we'll fill out the actors' salary envelopes and, and at that time kept it in my future wife's [Diana Powell Ward] dresser drawer, which was right around the corner from the theater and in case Bobby came in said look, I'm, I'm sorry. I can't pay, to pay you for the last week's rehearsal.  And if he had done that, if he came in and, and said that, then we were gonna say that's all right.  We, we got it, and we can, we could proceed.  Anyway, he did come up with it.  And we nev- didn't have to use that money, and we did finish the last week.  But by the time we finished the last (laughter) week of work, we were out of money.  So, when we opened, it wasn't like we, we had anything in, in the till for the pay, for the, the, the run after we opened.  We were depending on--we had the--the box office had to come up with something.  We had to come up with some money some kind of way.  But anyway, the rest is history, because we, we managed opening it--
Story_ID: 277217
Speaker 1: And, of course, from then on it became a major event in terms of the development of black theater, because not just the, the production [of 'Day of Absence' and 'Happy Ending,' Douglas Turner Ward] itself but all of my ideas and philosophies about the development of independent black theater that I outlined in a major article in The New York Times during the run of 'Day of Absence' [Douglas Turner Ward] in 1966, I think August of '66 [1966].  The New York Times printed this major article, which I said American theater for whites only, question mark ['American Theater: For Whites Only?' Douglas Turner Ward], and, and, and laid out what became the manifesto for black theater primarily.  And once, you know, one, one, once I did that article, that, that became the catalyst for what we all know now as the major development in terms of, of creation of the Negro Ensemble Company [NEC] and so on.
Speaker 2: Well, the two plays have been done, you know, you said for, are done somewhere every year (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: College productions--
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh yeah.  I just saw--
Speaker 2: --right.
Speaker 1: --cup, about a year and a half ago Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] did a very nice production.  Howard University did a, did a wonderful, as good, 'cause it's, you know, there was a young professor there, a young woman, professor there, and she directed it.  And I was always glad to see a, a younger generation, you know dealing, and it still work.  And, and the same--every time I've seen it, you know, with, with a new generation and people who weren't even born and shit.  It, it, the laughs are still (laughter), they're in the same place, I mean the same response, you know.  And, and, and, and even though the social period that it was done in, originated in is not there anymore.  It's still, it's still--I, and I also have come to the realization of what you said to me earlier before we started taping, that the art of the materials now is even more clearly evidenced.  I mean it's like, when you, when you read those two plays, it's not just the content to a certain extent.  It's a, it's the commun- the way it's expressed.
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's the writing.
Speaker 2: It's--
Speaker 1: It's the, you know, it's, this--
Speaker 2: --well writ- I mean--
Speaker 1: --all, all the, the, the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --writings and the, the ske- the skilled aspect of it.  And I'm not saying, you know, I'm, I'm distant from the plays enough now to look at 'em (laughter) as if--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --somebody else wrote 'em.
Speaker 2: --well, people say that when they read those: this is so well written--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, and, and--
Speaker 2: --and so well crafted (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and that, and that, now--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --stands out.
Story_ID: 277218
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Have you agonized in your career about not being able to write more or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Not because of the Haitian--
Speaker 2: --(unclear) yeah.
Speaker 1: --thing.  That, that kept me from, from agonizing, because once I realized that I wasn't gonna get a chance to just do it naturally, running a, a company and theater and, and, and the triple threating and all of that.  I knew I, I couldn't just depend on just the actual routine of the writer.  I had set aside special time.  And what I did is I then set aside not just for, for my writing thing, but it also coincided with, with, with my responsibility and my, my debt and, and, and my desire in terms of my family.  'Cause once, once, once, once I began to have, have, have two children, I knew that with my responsibility I wasn't gonna be able to see 'em (laughter) almost unless I really set aside special time.  So what I did is some, the some, the summers were sacrosanct.  Once the season was over, we packed up, we packed up and, and eventually found a place in, in, in Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts], not, and not because of Martha's Vin- I didn't know, I didn't know Martha's Vineyard from, from the ocean.  I didn't know nothing about it, so it wasn't what we went there for.  She, she, it's that we checked out to find out what would be most convenient.  And, and, and my, my, my then-wife, Diana [Powell Ward], went to visit this island, came back and said you know, 'cause people had recommended: well, it sound like you all might check out Martha's Vineyard.  And then she went and found a place it turned that on the end of the island, I loved when she told me about the black history in Oak Bluffs [Massachusetts] in, in Martha's Vineyard.  I loved that.  I said oh, I said oh, there are a lot of black folks on the island.  I said that's good.  That makes me feel comfortable.  And then she said on the other end is, is the, the Indian [Native American] township, Gay Head [Aquinnah, Massachusetts].  I said fine.  And she said there's a place.  I said look, that's, that's where I wanna go.  I said I'm glad (laughter), I'm glad to be on the island, especially an island with other black folks.  I said but I wanna get as far away (laughter), I wanna get far away from 'em as possible, 'cause I didn't want to be bothered.  I wanted to really go there, you know, and spend quality time with my family and, and, and then to combine it with writing.  So, the question you asked me about agonizing, no.  All of, for all of the years, starting in, in, in the time when we started going to Martha's Vineyard, which was 'round almost close to the birth of the children was, which was almost in, in, in the early '70s [1970s].  So, by, soon as I went away to Martha's Vineyard for those three months--and I went for three--I mean it was like, as I said, sacrosanct.  You came and you offered me a, a role in, a leading role in whatever movie or something.  No, I turned it down, no.  That, those, those three months were, were, were sacrosanct.  I mean I, we, we left in June and didn't come back until September, you know, and I was there the whole time, not, not going back and forth.  I was there, you know, the whole, whole summer, except a couple of occasions I had worked, you know, to, to come back to New York [New York] for a day or something.
Story_ID: 277219
Speaker 1: How many shows would you do in a season with Negro Ensemble Company [NEC] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) On, on an average--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --on the average I would say we averaged out over, over, over thirty years, what have you, at least three, three shows, three major shows a season.
Speaker 1: A season, okay.
Speaker 2: Sometime it was four, and a couple of times with the budget and so forth it was two, you know.  And, and you know, but on an average, I, I would say if you look at the whole roster of plays, the major plays--I'm not even talking about the workshop, you know, the stuff that we did, but he major plays, the major productions I would say at, at least three, three major productions a season, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But anyway, that the question in relation to, to--I continued to write.  Now, it just so happens, as I told you earlier, is that what I embarked on this, ha- this massive project of, of, and, and, and, and emerged after twenty-five years with three plays that altogether add up to almost twelve to fourteen hours of theater, 'cause the first two plays are, are almost four and a half hours, you know, the length of it, the epic, big canvas.  And that's why I finally, I, I exhausted the, the form; the epic form were those two plays.  And then I, I, I, I had only gotten--my, my, my original plan was, was, was to cover the, the, the, the, the, the period, the whole period between that, the three major leaders, you know, Toussaint [L'Ouverture], [Jean-Jacques] Dessalines, and [Henri] Christophe.  By the time I finished, the, the first two plays was more than ten hour so for--I had--the first play is the rise of, the rise of Toussaint; the second play is the fall of Toussaint.  I had, I had written already ten hours of theater and, and, and, and just had gotten to, to the final, Toussaint's final moment.  I hadn't even gotten a--but it, it was like a life works, and I, I sort of said okay.
Speaker 1: And we wanna get back to that, but, but we gotta pause for a minute.  But, but when did you start writing the Haitian trilogy?
Speaker 2: In the '70 [1970], about the early, the early of the, the early years of '70 [1970], around '74 [1974], around that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I'll, I'll, I'll explain--
Speaker 1: Right, we're gonna try to get just a minute, then catch up to it.
Story_ID: 277512
Speaker 1: As I was saying off camera I wanted to ask you about 'Perry's Mission.'  That was a play written by Clarence Young III.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It was produced by Negro Ensemble [Company (NEC)].  And you know, I can testify on the Dayton, Ohio end of it, when a local playwright has a play produced by Negro Ensemble in days, that's a big deal.  Negro Ensemble Company was a big deal (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in the country.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm smiling only because I, you know, it (unclear) history, but I, at the time it was going, I was, I was so pleased because I was committed.  And, and what I said in relation to that, that, that, that, that manifesto article ['American Theater: For Whites Only?' Douglas Turner Ward], to a certain extent, that if we went and searched for the, the talent and gave it an opportunity that it will, it, it, it was vast.  And as for me, being vast meant not just what was in New York [New York] or what had come to New York, cause all of us who, who New York had come from somewhere else anyway, but not just who, people that were here; fact, I think there were writers who got mad at me because I mean they thought when the Negro Ensemble Company came, the ones right in New York, then that, they had first access (laughter).  And suddenly, suddenly I knew it could come from chit- chitterlings which Miss--Mississippi, Dayton, whatever.  And immediately, you know, immediately after that first season, which I, I, you know, had to, had to plan in advance before I knew or before anybody knew about us, I had to plan a season.  But after that first season, if you notice the first play of the second season, just before I get to 'Perry's Mission,' suddenly is a play called 'God is a (Guess What?)' [Ray McIver].  Now, (laughter) when I, when I discovered the script it was 'God is a Nigger.'  And I said oh, I said no, no, I, I don't have no problem with that.  I said but I know the response just to the title is gonna be so off-putting they're not gonna even get to (laughter) to deal with the material itself, so I said no.  So I was the one who then say oh no (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Is that like [HistoryMaker] Ed Bullins' or, or who, who is it?  Who--
Speaker 2: No, that's Ray McIver, but that's where--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I'm coming, that's the point I'm coming to--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --is that I, this, this script, some of the Perry, 'Perry's Mission,' something always--once we were in business, the scripts started coming through the transom, and as I said, from ev- anywhere.  Even though we had also had a playwright's workshop in developing, you know, writing and so forth.  Even members of that workshop got mad 'cause they thought, oh, I'm part of the Negro Ensemble Company Workshop.  I, I, I got X, I got first dibs on major production.  No, I told my staff, I said look, we're not a program.  Nobody have dibs, nobody (laughter) has dibs by being here in New York.  I said you know, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that will be a punishment to writers who don't live in New York, the fact that New York writers, you, or somebody in the workshop or somethin' got access to being produced.  I said no.  I will decide.  I will select according to my own aesthetic and standards and everything else, wherever I find a play that I think is worth being doing.  I don't care where it comes from.  Suddenly, I was leaving 'cause I, you know, I had readers who would recommend things, but I, I know.  I had to (laughter), I had to read the plays myself to judge.
Story_ID: 277513
Speaker 1: And so I get this play, this, this weird sort of play, and it's obvious that it had been written years ago.  But it was so unusual, written in an almost Elizabethan rhythm and, and, and images and metaphors and so forth.  And I said this has got to be crazy.  Where did play come from?  And it was obvious that it had, had, had written almost back in the '40s [1940s] in, in a way.  And I had no idea who it was.  Ray McIver, though was the, was the title [sic. playwright], so I did a little investigating.  He's from Atlanta [Georgia].  And Lonne Elder [III] happen to, to, to visit Atlanta, and he came back there, and he walked, oh, he said, "Doug [HistoryMaker Douglas Turner Ward], you know I was Atlanta, said I, I, I met this crazy, this crazy, this crazy dude down there.  He's the principal of the school or something, but this boy, this boy was crazy."  And, and, and, and, and immediately something I said, "His name is Ray McIver."  He said, "How did you know?"  I said, "Man, I got this play.  And it's got to be this, it's got to be--when you--what you describe about this crazy dude, (laughter) I said it's got to be him."  Anyway, it turned out that, that, that, that it was.  And this was after our first season [at the Negro Ensemble Company (NEC)].  And we happened to be brought to Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] to perform two plays at Spelman on (unclear) theater.  And when I went to Atlanta and I was in the corridor, just before the first performance, and suddenly this man shambled down the, the, the corridor and had some pile of papers and, and stuff.  And it, what it, what it was is that he was putting out a local sheet.  And he was just coming to give me the sheet.  But he approached me and he, he says, "Sire."  First thing (laughter). I said you (laughter), I said, "You are, you are Ray McIver," you know (unclear) you know, like we back in Elizabethan England, sire, addressing me as sire.  I said you, man, you got--and he was shocked.  I said, "I wanna do your play."  Anyway, but the rest is history, 'cause (laughter)--and he turned out to be a wonderful character and everything else.  But I, I'm saying that was the first instance.  That was, if you know, the first, second, first play of the second season was, right, 'God is a (Guess What?).'  After that, I've forgotten where, which season 'Perry,' 'Perry,' 'Perry' ['Perry's Mission,' Clarence Young III] came, but, but, but it was the same thing.
Speaker 2: This the second season.  It was the second play I think of the second season.
Speaker 1: Was, was, was it a, a part of that same--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we, looked it up, yeah.
Speaker 1: Suddenly I--I don't remember exactly, but I know, once again, I read, I read the script.  I said hey.  I, I found out afterwards.  I didn't know that, that, that, that, that, that--
Speaker 2: Clarence [Young III].
Speaker 1: Clarence had, had his own theater [Theatre West, Inc.].  I didn't--all, all of the history of that I just, I just read the script and, and, and made the decision and, and was thankful to find out all, you know, getting the--and meeting Cla- Clarence personally and finding out about the, 'bout what was going on in, in his own theater and, and everything else.  But it came, you know, I selected it like that.  And that became almost 75 percent out, let's say almost 75 percent.  Let's say almost 75 percent of the materials that we did almost came, one way or the other, that route, not, not by some agent recommending or somebody recommending.  Most of this, most of it came about me discovering the script and, and decided that it was worthy of, of, of, of being done.  And of course, 'Perry,' 'Perry's Mission' was a joy, you know, in a sense.  And it came--yeah, it was perfect 'cause, 'cause, cause I had it on, on, on a, a double bill I think with, with, what was it 'Rosalie Pritchett'?
Speaker 2: I think so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Rosa, 'Rosalie Pritchett' and, and, and yeah, I think was, was, was his other play by the Molletes, Carlton [Mollete] and, and, and, and his wife, Barbara Mollete.  I--there, there was all, all of these writers.  I hadn't, I, I didn't know any of 'em personally beforehand.  And that's why I say to a certain extent there were New York [New York] writers who've gotten mad at me because it's almost like: "Why isn't he doing (laughter) my play?"
Speaker 2: I think now, now Joseph [A.] Walker, he, he, he's a New York guy, right?  Joseph Walker, lived, wrote a--
Speaker 1: Joe, Joe, of, of course he was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --are, he was in New York.  By that time he was in New York, 'cause, 'cause he, had, you know, he was, he was teaching at City College [of New York, New York, New York] and had his own group [Demi-Gods], once again, had his own group there.  And, but I didn't know Joe personally.  He was of, of, of a younger generation.  But, the, the pattern was that once, once we existed, writers who already had been doing something of their own just submitted stuff.  And of course, it stimulated writers to then write plays, you know, and, and, and, and so forth.  But, after that first season, I, I didn't have to, I didn't, I didn't have to look too, too hard.  The material was, was coming in and, and, and proved what I always thought, that, that, that give, given the opportunity, that black creativity and writing would, would, would, would flourish once, once they, they knew there was an outlet.
Speaker 2: Did you have a favorite work of some of the work that came in like that from, from outside of New York or no?
Speaker 1: About who?
Speaker 2: Did, did you have a favorite play of all of those--I always wonder (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, because it's like children; I mean it's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --like children.
Story_ID: 277514
Speaker 1: I say that, I, and, and I believe in diversity, and I also taught and trained myself to try to recognize worth, quality of, of a wide range of, of, of, of expressions.  See, I had, you know, and if you notice, very, there, there was very little of the, the works that I did that, that, that were like mine.  So it wasn't like I was stuck with a narrow perspective about what was good.  I mean most of the, you know, there--it's not that I, I consciously thought of it, but it's like not too many writers followed me in terms of, of, of the satirical vein of writing.
Speaker 2: Just think of like Ben Caldwell had those, real short one-act plays, but they were really--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --hard-hitting little plays--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that, but I know Ben--eve- even, even, even of that period, even, even the black satirical writer of that period.  My, my thing, not just to compare it with my--is that it was, to, to me it was too heavy-handed.  See, very few writers followed me with a switchblade attack, you know (laughter).  It's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, he kind of had a sledgehammer.
Speaker 1: Yeah, a sledgehammer.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And that, that, that, you know, that can be, be, be--it doesn't take away anything from it.  It, it almost drew too much attention to its polemical message.
Speaker 2: So the polemics over (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The polemics is the over--
Speaker 2: --challenge the arts.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, and, and that, that was, that was the thing.  And I, and I, as I counseled writers, I said look, you, hey, you, I mean we, you, you, you can write about anything as valid (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Do you think though--
Speaker 1: But, but, but the, but your message, I say it's got to be theater first.
Speaker 2: You know, when I think about those days, a guy like Ben Caldwell today, if he had his own cartoon show or something, he'll probably be, he could probably turn out script after script of, you know.  There are people making money writing--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --scripts for cartoons, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And, 'cause his message would hit hard, and it would be like a simple, you know, kind of a thing.  But I, I hear what you're saying, yeah.
Story_ID: 277515
Speaker 1: 'Cause when, when I said not too many people follow, it's like--see, the power of my aesthetics in relation to, to, particularly dealing with, with social subject matter, is I, like the 'Day of Absence' and 'Happy Ending' [Douglas Turner Ward] were written for us, not written for us in a way that, that narrow.  But, it's almost like our writers are--white people didn't need, didn't, don't exist.  There nothing in (laughter) my work that is, that is, is, is like Baraka-ish, you know, even, even with [Amiri] Baraka and all, all of the, that, that hard-hitting--the militant period you're talking about, the problem with it, aesthetically and artistically, was it was still I, I, I got to, I got, I, I, I got address the white folks.  I gotta kill you.  I gotta choke you.  I gotta curse you out and so forth.  But my stuff was, was much more threatening because the tone, it was almost like I wasn't, you know.  I was cutting (laughter) them in pieces without even addre- dressing them as being primary.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it seem to be, be about black strategy and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --of life, how, how we negotiate this.
Speaker 1: Yeah, absolutely.  But, but the reason why I live at it, because as a writer I, I come artistic conclusion, not just, not just a political--that I was free by writing for a black public.  See, that freed me to a certain extent because that meant that I, I, I didn't have to be over exposit--expository.  I didn't have to, to teach or explain at the same time I'm trying to create, no.  As I said in, in that original article in [The] New York Times ['American Theater: For Whites Only?' Douglas Turner Ward] I mean.  You know, the imp- for us to be involved in addressing to white folks, it's like they want arithmetic, where we are already at the (laughter) level of algebra or geometry, see.  So, when I talk about writing for a black public, there's, there's a lot of stuff that I, I could suggest.  I don't need to overwrite it; I don't need to over-explain it.  I don't--I can, I can suggest it and everybody get before (laughter), get it before I even say the whole sentence.  They get it from the suggestion.  And, and, and, and that, that, that, that's helpful for writers 'cause that, that keeps you from having to, to be over-polemical or over-messaged, you know, in, in, in a sense.  There's nothing wrong with the impact of, of social and, and political, addressing political addressing political scene and so forth.  But if it becomes overt, as we always say: if you're gonna pulpit then message, it, it, it, that, that, that, that, that militates against it, 'cause we almost say that, okay, go get in the, the pulpit is where you should do that.  But the feeling, it's got to, it has its own means and, and, and necessities.  It's gotta be, you know, that it's got to have, it's got to be within the context of, of, of, of the form of expression and especially in Western--you know, we live in the most highly developed capitalist system in the world.  Like in contrast, I went to, to, to Zambia and participated in a theater project in which we went out to the village and to create skits to help people, teach people how to boil water in the village, you know, to, to be healthy.  So, and they call it theater, you know, theater for development.  Yes, in certain contexts, you can use theater forms for educated purpose, for a whole lot of things.  But, hey, you come, you come back to, to, to a highly developed, televised, digitalized society, those educational things can be much more easily done by (laughter), by five minutes of a television spot.  You don't have to go out and create a whole (laughter), you know, skits, skit, like I did when, when I helped people develop the, the, the thing we were visiting and found out what was the main issue; found out that, hey, people were gettin' sick in the villages and so forth.  They were drinking water out of the, the, the creeks and shit, and that water was polluted and feces, whatever.  And, but, hey, to their naked eye, you know, it didn't look, look, look like it's drinkable.  So I helped--one skit, skit I helped 'em create was we, we had a situation where a boy, kid got sick, and a woman took him to the, to the clinic and so forth.  And the doctor who, or whoever, eventually told her like it was the water.  She didn't believe it.  And then he took her, took--looked through the (laughter), the, the microscope to see all (laughter) that shit in it, and hey.  Now, when we back to the village we had the short skit, and then we had a, a microscope and invited all of the villages who were participating to come by (laughter) and look at the water, same impact.  You can use thea- theatrical forms and devices and, and, for a lot of reasons.

Speaker 1: Now did NEC [Negro Ensemble Company] ever engage in street theater projects like they used to do in South Africa and that sort, you know, to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, because--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: --my, my focus was on creating a theater with text plays, text plays and also creating a audience that would come consciously to the, the theater, not--and, and that's a valid thing, like what the, you know, Free Southern Theater was doing, which was wonderful down--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's, it's basically to polemicize (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --on some level.
Speaker 2: But, but the irony about it is the, the, when I finished 'Day of Absence' [Douglas Turner Ward] the first place I offered it was, was, was the Free Southern Theater.  And it would have been perfect, but at that point, I think they--what's his name, who, who runs The Tulane Drama Review?  Richard Schechner was, was involved with him.  And, and Richard, as the committed was to the project of this Free Southern Theater in terms of artistically, they, he was always still more interested in bringing the Europe forum and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and doing it in, in the cotton patch, adapting the Europe, Euro forum.  So, suddenly, it's like, it didn't occur that an indigenous play (laughter) like 'Day of Absence' was, was the perfect thing for the--that they should have been doing, you know, but he, that wasn't that, that wasn't his focus.  He was more interested in taking [Bertolt] Brecht or whatever, whoever, and, and, and, and redoing it into the--you know, they were still stuck with that mode, that it had to still come from the artistic pool of the Eurocentric theater and then readapted for the (laughter), the cotton patch, but, no, I mean to, you know.  And you know, it was, it was, it was looking at it from outside, it was sort of stupid that they, they didn't, you know.
Speaker 1: Now, now--
Speaker 2: They didn't jump on doing (laughter) doing 'Day of Absence' 'cause by that time it hadn't been done anywhere, but, so it had no history back to it.  Somebody had to realize, just like I did with, with the 'Perry's Mission' [Clarence Young III] and all those plays.  They had to realize that there was something there to be, to be, to be done from the, the script, you know.  It didn't have a history, didn't have a, a background or anything like that.  You, you know, you, so you had to have somebody with, with, with the sensitivity and the, the, the, the wits and everything else to recognize something and what could be done with it in terms if it was put, put on its feet three-dimensionally.

Speaker 1: We talked to [HistoryMaker] Paul Carter Harrison about three years ago--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --about his concept of what African theater is, what black theater is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (laughter) Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: And you know, we talked about experimenting with different, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --with music and dance and everything in the context of telling a story.  And he was very, you know, committed to creating something other than the European model on what goes on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Paul--
Speaker 1: --the stage.
Speaker 2: --Paul, Paul--
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: --is one if I only, inspire me and, me and one of my other favorite writers, Gus, Gus Edwards, we love each other.  We love Paul and so, but sometimes we want to choke him 'cause Paul, Paul is brilliant, but sometimes his theoretical--I'm glad--Paul is a wonderful playwright, but sometimes I'm glad that he doesn't try to (laughter), to, to write in his plays his theory, because academically, and he comes out of academia also.  And he's written, as you know, know, books and, and so forth and so on.  Sometimes his theoretical, what you say is ideas about it are interesting.  But a lot of time me and Gus shake our head and say, you know, Paul, Paul (laughter), Paul, Paul, that, that, that, that, that, those little things could be too recondite or whatever in terms of Paul's afro, the idea there.  I mean it, it reads well on paper.  It's just as not, it's not as translatable (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did, did, did you ever try to experiment with some of his ideas in the--
Speaker 2: No, I--
Speaker 1: --NEC [Negro Ensemble Company] and--
Speaker 2: No, no, I'm, my, my, my thing, I'm, I'm a pragmatist about theater.  Now you, as you, as you know, my involvement in theater is pragmatic in a sense that I was trained in, in, on, in all of the discipline as a practitioner, you know.  Whatever my literary background and, and education and so forth, I write plays and understand plays for, for a public, and the how the communication of it through that medium.  I'm an actor, became a director through necessity and all that.  But finally, when you practice all of these, the--at, at the, at the point of production, like I said, theories are wonderful, and I would gladly embrace anybody who can convert their theory into practice, and it works.  If it doesn't work, fuck it.  Now, until it's done, the ideas to me are, are, are, are, are static.  I don't care how they sound, how great they sound, and how aesthetic, and, and, and for some time, political and polemical they are.  And my, you know, my thing--not, not, this is criticizing, put Paul down like that, but it--you know, we, me and Gus, like the last time we--I was in--did a reading of, of one of Gus' plays out at Arizona.  Paul, you know, was there, and then we all went to, to, to, to dinner--a, a, a luncheon thing.  And, and Paul, you know, spoke at the luncheon thing, (laughter) and me and Gus sat there because his--we, we get lost; we get lost with (laughter), with the academic nature of, of his theory, theor- theorizing about that.  And, but thankfully, when, when, you know, he, he, you know, he directs and, and, and, and stuff like that, but sometimes we find that Paul, when, when, when he, when he, when his idea about how he wants to do a production, sometimes a theory stand in the way of the, the, the prac- the practice of it.  You know, he can, he can impose, he can impose theory on something apart from let it, letting whatever the, the result arise out of something, you, you, you, you know.  And academics have that tendency in the first place, that the, the theory, they impose the theory on the material.  They don't let the material emerge out and create whatever, the innovation or what have you that comes out of it, you know.
Story_ID: 277518
Speaker 1: Of course, one of the greatest productions we did was, was Paul's [HistoryMaker Paul Carter Harrison] 'The Great MacDaddy.'  Now if--I remember when Paul--talking to Paul about it and, and even reading what he said about how, how, how, how, how, how it should be done to a certain extent.  When I directed I had, I, I almost had to ignore--when I went into act, it wasn't like I spent a whole lot of time talking about its being based on the, the, the, the African work.  I said this, you know, the material here is, is, is generically, generically black out of black life, and it's, you know, the scene by scene and so forth.  It's a wonderful, great, great work.  But in order to direct it, I had to, I couldn't, (laughter) I couldn't pay much attention to, to Paul's description of how, what it was, and all of that.  I said (laughter) no, I'll take scene by scene and put these scenes together and make 'em work.
Speaker 2: 'The Great MacDaddy' was, was produced when?  What, what year?  I was looking for it on this outline, and I couldn't find it.  But (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'The Great MacDaddy' I just was going over it.  'The Great MacDaddy' was about, 'bout the, about the sixth, about the sixth or seventh (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sixth season [sic. eighth season]?
Speaker 1: --season.
Speaker 2: Okay, yep, yep.  So that put us in the mid '70s [1970s] and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah. And we did it twice.  We did it in, in original production that Al Freeman [Jr.] was in.  And, and Phylicia [Rashad] was, was, was in that also.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now one brother--now Joseph [A.] Walker, I'd read, only two plays I've read of his was 'Ododo' and '[The] River Niger.'
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, Joe has a--
Speaker 2: 'River Niger' became the hit.  'Ododo' seemed to be in a vein of what Paul Carter Harrison was talking (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah--
Speaker 2: --theater.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but 'Ododo'--yeah.  Joe, Joe--you know, the, the, the influence, that, you know.  When I did 'The River Niger' it was all, it came as a surprise to me because I was used to Joe more from the material--
Speaker 2: Which--
Speaker 1: --of 'Ododo.'  That style and form was much more common.  And I still say people don't realize that Joe has a vast body of work, and very, very little of it is similar to 'River Niger.'  His explorations, you know, theatrically is closer to 'Ododo,' not necessarily the ritual sort of thing.  But all, his, his plays are, are, are much, much, not, not, not realistic; you know, his, his works are not, not real.  His, his, his imagination is much more fertile than just the, the, you know, the, the, the realistic form of, of, of 'Niger,' to a certain extent.
Speaker 2: Well, tell us about the development of 'River Niger.'  That, that was like a big hit for NEC [Negro Ensemble Company] and you know--
Speaker 1: Yeah, well--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the, the, the, 'The River Niger,' the first potential commercial hit that we had was 'Ceremonies [in Dark Old Men,' Lonne Elder III], which was the ser- second season.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's Lonne Elder.
Speaker 1: Lonne Elder.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Ceremonies' could have been earlier.  What, what happened to 'River Niger' later could have happened to 'Ceremonies.'  I refused to let it happen because it was too early in our--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --history.
Speaker 2: So the 'Ceremonies in Dark Old Men,' Lonne Elder--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it, it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'Ceremony'--
Speaker 2: --you know.
Speaker 1: --'Ceremony' was similar, 'Ceremony' opened in, in like, in New York [New York] commercial whatever the arena that 'Ceremony' was done in, immediately if you wanted to talk about commer- we could have moved it to Broadway.  'Cause I'd always joked because, 'cause Lonne, by that time, Lonne didn't have a pot to piss in, you, you know, was always broke and so on.  And overnight I always joke and say he, he, he went from not a penny in his pocket to, to almost having thirty thousand dollars offered to him (laughter) almost immediately.  But it was too early for us.  We still were committed to a company of actors and so forth, so there was no way.  And I of course, was, was a central actor in 'Ceremonies.'  There's no way in the world that I could tie up the company.  We didn't have enough.  We didn't have a company of forty people, you know, that could double up doing--no.  We had a very small, tight company.
Story_ID: 277227
Speaker 1: This is a critical juncture in any black theater company (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well, the--
Speaker 1: What you do with a hit.
Speaker 2: Well, see, that, that's why I'm, I'm going was to 'Ceremony' ['Ceremonies in Dark Old Men,' Lonne Elder III].  Why?  With what I said, the possibility, and this is New York [New York], and we, we in the, you know, this--when I say that overnight the reviews and all of that in the traditional way, the interest created by the opinion-makers, to a certain extent.  We not--I'm not even talking about my commitment to developing our own audience apart from the middleman, of the white opinion-maker.  But it was obvious from the reviews that, hey, this could be a commercial hit property.  But we weren't ready to logistically, as I said.  The [Negro Ensemble] Company [NEC] could not suddenly concentrate on this one play.  It happened I think the 'Ceremony' wasn't right.  'Ceremony' was second in the season.  I still had two, two more plays to do that season.  I got the same company.  I got people already assigned to do the other work.  We, we extended a run maybe three weeks or so before it, the, period in between the, the third production that had to be done.  And then I gave it back to Lonne [Elder III] to do with what, what he wanted.  Bobby [HistoryMaker Robert Hooks] and, and, and Gerry [Gerald Krone], right away we had a two or three-hour meeting.  And, and I--they said well, what, what, what should we do? I said no.  If we do this, 'cause I remember what, what you was telling me in, in between the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) When we were off camera--
Speaker 2: Off camera.  The--see, I learned from, from 'Anna Lucasta,' [Philip Yordan] old Negro--
Speaker 1: The--
Speaker 2: --American Negro--
Speaker 1: The 'Anna' okay--
Speaker 2: --Theatre [American Negro Theatre] thing.  What, what you told me about '[The Death of] Bessie Smith' [Edward Albee]-
Speaker 1: Pullman Theatre [sic. Goodman Theatre, Chicago, Illinois], yeah.
Speaker 2: That, see, 'Anna Lucasta' destroyed the American Negro Theatre.  It was a hit.  The moved it to Broadway.  They got involved with the Broadway show.  That became their focus and bam.  The original project went down the drain.  I learned from that.  When this happened with 'Ceremony' I told, I said Gerry, and then I said no, we're not, we're not ready.  Also, we, we have, we have said what our mission is.  If we, this early, get involved in terms of a commercial property and, and, and a promotion and, and, and, and, and involvement like that, everybody will be cynical, rightly so.  That all we were doing with all our pretense about all, all our (laughter) aims and purposes, all, all we were doing were waiting like everybody else in theater and professional or what have you.  Everybody else was waiting for the lightning to strike.  And here we have lightning, and we, that's all we were waiting for.  I said no, we will make a better statement by not going that route and continuing with our program as we outlined it and so forth.  I said we--you know, it's too early.  We haven't even been around long enough to confirm our purpose.  You know, we haven't, we, you know, we've, we've only had not even two seasons.  This is on, this is only the second play of the second season.  We'd only done four, and suddenly we have a, a hit.  And we get involved with that, and all of the, all of the things that go along with it I said it will destroy us.  And thankfully, Bobby and, and, and Gerry agreed, reluctantly 'cause, you know, you always need money; you always--
Speaker 1: People want a hit, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And, and, but, and so but, but, but I knew better.  I said no, no, this is not what we set out to do.  If you go and look back at our prospectus and everything else, I said no, we set out committing to, to creating an independent theater of its own.  Whatever happened is gravy.  I've no, no, no problem with that.  You know, we all professionals ourselves.  But I knew that, no, this is nonprofit project set out for the development of, of, of, of the art or the artist and everybody else, with, with a, a commitment to, to a constant, consistent season.  I've written an article talking about the permanence, independence of this.  And suddenly, all we got is, is, is a hit there.  Everybody will, will, will not laugh, but they'll be cynical about it, because everybody assumed that that's what you're out for.  Hey, I sat down.  We extended it three or four weeks and so forth, and we kept rights for it in terms of like we could still tour it wherever we want and all of that--
Story_ID: 277228
Speaker 1: But I gave it ['Ceremonies in Dark Old Men,' Lonne Elder III] back to Lonne [Elder III] to do what he want, what he wanted commercially.  And within four weeks or so after we gave it back to him, he, along with, with, with, with, with, with Ed, Ed Cambridge, who had been the, the dire- director of record on, on, on our production, Ed became the director of a independent production that they did right around, in fact, right around the corner from where we were.  We were on 8th Avenue and, and, and, and, and, and, no, St. Marks [Place] and 2nd Avenue, with 8th Street and 2nd Avenue.  They did it at a, at a theater [Pocket Theatre, New York, New York] that, that was right around the corner on, on 3rd Avenue, and, and, and between 13th [Street] and 14th Street, right around the, you know, walking distance from where we're--whole new production.  In fact, [HistoryMaker] Denise [Nicholas], who had been part of my company, but had left when she got the 222, 'Room 222' television thing, she was in that production.  I think Dick Ward [Richard Ward] did the role that I originated with, with, with Russell [B.] Parker.  And you know, they did it on a commercial.  It wasn't broad, but was a, it was a non-Broadway but a commercial production.  And it ran, you know, they ran a decent--they ran for about four months, four or five months consistent.  But I, I couldn't do it.  I didn't have a company to devote to doing, you know, to doing this independent and still continue with our regular program.  No, I had to, that, that had to go.  I had to continue with our regular program as stated, as promised and so forth.
Speaker 2: What was at stake?  You know, what was--so, you, you felt something was at stake that, at stake that was greater than just being in a big show, right?
Speaker 1: Oh, absolutely.  There's a fucking whole project, the NEC [Negro Ensemble Company].  The whole, the whole program of the NEC was at stake.
Speaker 2: And is this a difficult concept to, to--I know a lot of people get into (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'Course, of course.
Speaker 2: People get into--
Speaker 1: But you gotta have a fucking vision.
Speaker 2: A lot of people get in theater and they think ah, you know, I'm gonna be a star if I keep--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --acting, and somebody's gonna discover me and all that sort of thing.  I mean I would say maybe--I don't know; correct if I'm wrong--I'd say most actors get--are thinking that when they get involved (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, and nothing's wrong with--
Speaker 2: But, yeah.
Speaker 1: --that aim and ambition.  But there are different goals if you can combine or include.  When somebody's commercial, like 'cause you know, yesterday Denzel [Washington] opened in 'Fences' [August Wilson].  You know, he's a star, and he, you know, was, he does, does what stars do now: you get the, a name enough, and then you can use it.   And there's nothing wrong with coming back to, to do a play in, or, and, and so forth on Broadway in a commercial situation like that.  As you know, our biggest stars, all the (laughter), a bulk of 'em came out of the NEC.  I had no problem with individuals pursuing a life to make a living.  That's what the purpose of it, the professional living.  And we happen to live in an environment where, hey, this is a capitalist environment of profit-making and all of those things in order to function almost, in some instances.  The artists don't have, we don't have systems like European or Eastern Europe used to have, of companies, subsidized major companies with rosters of, of a hundred actors or rosters and, and, and two hundred technicians and major theaters and major, you know, committed to the art per se, supported by the society (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 277229
Speaker 1: That we got, got the National Endowment for the Arts [NEA].  What they recognize is theater, dance, opera (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah--
Speaker 1: These are all these big European productions, aren't they?  I mean they're like--
Speaker 2: No, but they--
Speaker 1: --you know, yeah.
Speaker 2: --but, but that, but we--it still--
Speaker 1: We don't have--
Speaker 2: No, we, we, we got--the National Endowment is, is, is a pittance.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, we don't, we have no national policy in relation to the fucking arts.
Speaker 1: Well, okay, you're saying in terms (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You, you know, little grant here, you know, all, all of that shit is, is so--for most of those major theaters.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Look, I was on the National Endowment panel for four years I think.  Yes, the money that we got was significantly, was, was necessary, 'cause it comprised of, of a major part, por- portion of our budget.  Most of those major theaters that you talkin' about, the Mark Taper [Forum, Los Angeles, California], the Minnesota--
Speaker 1: The Goodman [Theatre, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: --Minneapolis [Minnesota]--
Speaker 1: Yeah, the--okay, the Penumbra [Theatre, St. Paul, Minnesota].
Speaker 2: --all, all of these major theaters.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I'm not even, Penumbra, that's the black one, right?
Speaker 1: Well, yeah--
Speaker 2: They're a little, little, you know, pittance.  I mean they, they get a little, little, a couple of pennies.  What I'm, what I'm coming to is that the major nonprofit theaters all around the country in the major cities, their budget--what the National Endowment, the percentage of their budget doesn't even arise, doesn't, doesn't even amount to 3 percent.  They, therefore, it was just the, the form of getting, using--but it, it didn't, it didn't even matter, even here in New York [New York].  Joe Papp [Joseph Papp], hey, if Joe Papp com- company [The Public Theater, New York, New York] didn't run on National Endowment.  These the, the, the, these are, these, these, these nonprofit major theaters are subsidized by the same contributions independent, individual contribution, grants and so forth from both wealthy individuals, corporations, what have you.  The National Endowment, part of that is not even of significance.  It was significant also, and it also led to our downfall, because it, it, between the National Endowment and the state and the city, that, between those three almost com- comprise maybe 60 percent of our budget.  So once [President Ronald Wilson] Reagan came in and that shit went out the window, policies changed, and, and, and, and we went from receiving let's say $225,000 a year to forty.  I mean that, that, that was a chalk-out, and finally, we, we could not overcome that, that, that, that, that--we could not make up for it because we don't have access to the corporations and the, and the wealthy individuals like, you know, these other, the, the, the, these, these, these major mainstream white institutions have.  So anyway, getting back, the policy there, hey, the national, we don't, we don't really have a policy.  We what, what, what we have with what people would get mad about a national endowment, shit there, there, there's, there's no money there.  Most, most major countries have set aside a certain amount of their major budget, let's say five, five percent of their major budget for the arts, which means millions of dollars and shit.  And all of these major companies get fully subsidized.  They don't have to go around talking about begging money from, from every source, the corporation.  The state delivered its obligation to culture by supporting the theater and opera and all, all of these things.  Like, we're still, you know in our capitalistic mode, still depend on oh, that's, that's supposed to be done just like, just, just, just like profit-making.  You know, we, we, we can't even get, we, we don't, we can't even put our, our, our, our ha- our hands around the whole concept that it's natural to subsidize art, that it's, you know, like libraries.  You're supposed to, you know, you, if you went out there and asked for libraries to be supported by a private sources, shit, we, (laughter) we wouldn't have those libraries and shit 'cause they wasn't deemed, deemed that, of, of, of essential urgency, but most other countries I mean this is the standard thing.  You go to Germany, hey, forget about the old Eastern Europe thing, where, you know, the sub- the state subsidized totally, you know, the socialist country.  But if you go to Germany, may, may just France and Germany, there, the it's, it's, it's automatic--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that every city of a certain size has a opera company, (laughter) a dance company and a theater and so forth.  They don't have to go around begging money from all over and wasting time and energy and so forth--
Story_ID: 277230
Speaker 1: Getting back to the issue that you're talking about, once the 'Ceremony' ['Ceremonies in Dark Old Men,' Lonne Elder III] experi- we made a statement that we meant business in terms of our program [at the Negro Ensemble Company (NEC)].  And success, the potential success of commercial success wasn't gonna stop us from our central purpose in terms of the type theater with it.  Okay, now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And that goal is to, this was just--
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: --stated for whoever watching this is to establish a black theater--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --with--
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now the contrast--see, what people, what, what people don't, you know, don't look at things in perspective.  The contrast with, with 'Ceremony' and, and, and, and '[The River] Niger' [Joseph A. Walker] is significant because suddenly here we got 'Niger' similar; I mean 'Niger' on a, with the same pattern.  I mean 'Niger' got these, these sensational reviews; people were lining up down the steps like you said about, 'bout 'Bessie Smith' ['The Death of Bessie Smith,' Edward Albee] in Chicago [Illinois], the whole thing.  But, 'Niger' now is, is I think maybe the fifth season, fifth, sixth season.  We have established, we have established ourselves and being our program, our, our commitment to our philosophy of theater.  We've established that, so that, nobody's gonna question whatever we do apart from--long as we stick to our main purpose and can include somethin' else in it, fine.  So, we're at a different stage, you know.  Our credibility has been established, so that's not an issue anymore.  That's not at issue.  Nobody's gonna say if we go quote so-called to Broadway, now, nobody's gonna question that as taking away from our central purpose.  You know, we've been around all--and we, we, we've established our credibility.  But more important, we've then make a decision.  We, at St. Mark's [Playhouse, New York, New York], we have a hundred and fifty seat house.  We already, we've developed, we've now developed a, a, a consistent audience of our own.  We have, we have a, we have an audience, so, so suddenly, we're, our hundred and fifty seat house, the overload of now these white people coming when their opinion-makers tell 'em 'cause they don't, white people are not gonna be coming a, around, unless their opinion-makers tell 'em (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Unless the reviews--
Speaker 1: --and shit, right.
Speaker 2: --are good--
Speaker 1: So, suddenly, with a hundred and fifty seat house and their pattern of, of, of usurpation 'cause black folks is (laughter) you know, they'll wait the last minute.  They ain't gon' buy no ticket in advance.  So, so suddenly, the white people now, they're coming out.  They got, they done bought up the whole house, so we, the irony about it, we, we not gon' be able to get in our regular audience because the white people now are, are coming earlier and usurping the hundred and fifty seats, okay.  So we had a lot of reasons. We said okay, we got, we gotta, you know, if we gonna, if we're gonna get our own public, we gotta expand it to (unclear).  So anyway, make a long story short, we went to Broadway not to go to Broadway.  Broadway and what it meant never interests us.

Speaker 1: We and our purpose in terms of, of, of a show on Broadway or anywhere was any show that com- any show that could, could, could pay for itself, any show that could pay for itself, it could run forever.  It wasn't necessary for us to, to, to, to, to profit from it above and beyond that.  That was enough.  Like, what eventually happened, '[The] River Niger' [Joseph A. Walker] still ran on Broadway longer than any nonmusical black show, almost a year.  Now, but just think, for the year it ran, we didn't make no big, big profit off it to put back into the till [of the Negro Ensemble Company (NEC)].  You know, we, we--that wasn't this.  We were satisfied as long as it broke even.  But in breaking even, it's keeping a whole company.  It's paying people's salary for a year.  It's keeping, you know, all that, so that, hey, that was fine.  Now, we also were lucky in that we made a deal with Broadway managers, producers who needed something to fill the house and therefore damn near gave us (laughter) a deal.  That was, was so ridiculous that we could still charge cheap tic- ticket price.  In fact, the booth that, you know, give, give a cut-rate tickets used to get mad at us because they wanted, they wanted us to, to be part of the booth.  But we couldn't be part of the booth 'cause our ticket prices were almost less (laughter) than what they were cut-rating it.  So we were able to keep the ticket price low.  We were able to accommodate a larger audience, you know in a, in, in the space.  So all of, all of these factors, and we got a deal where our breakeven was not what you say, onerous, to the point that you describe about what happened to that play when, when, when they decided to go into (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)(unclear)--
Speaker 1: --all of the union--no, we dealt with all of that.  We, we, hey, in order to go there, we, the deal had to assure us that it was financially not straining us.  It, it had to be a deal where, hey, as I said, as long as that show took care of itself and that's why it ran.  Now, the thing you also learn is that with your natural public and the public for that, 'The River Niger,' I don't care how many white people decided to come.  They never were going to come in numbers enough to be the dominant force.  But we knew that our natural audience was finite.  Black people numerically and moneywise, even if they came out 100 percent, that's gonna run out somewhere along the line.  Rather it's a year, rather it's whatever, it's gonna run out.  And when it runs out, that's, that's, that's gonna be it.  They're not gonna redupli- they, they can't reduplicate themself forever because that's financially they don't have that sort of resource, you know, to, to, to--like the, the larger white public where shows run five, ten years or some shit like that.  But, no, 'The River Niger' ran a year, and by the time we saw the not the, the audience, we, we, we, realized that we, we pretty much exhausted the audience, its natural audience, and white people never made up for it.  White people never came out to the extent that the, you would think that the reviews--a white show getting the reviews of 'River Niger' would still be running almost.
Story_ID: 277232
Speaker 1: See and people, like talking about 'Fences' [August Wilson] people get the idea that 'Fences' was some sort of success.  'Fences' was a--'Fences' didn't even run as long as 'The River Niger' [Joseph A. Walker] on Broadway.  And The New York Times literally turned the fucking paper over to 'em, the whole, the weekly, the Sunday, all--for the whole time that 'Fences' ran, forget about black shows.  'Fences' got more publicity, free publicity, from the major organ of, of American theater, The New York Times than any playwright in the history.  And if you, you, you go back and get somebody now to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) True, I, I, I--
Speaker 1: --to check that.
Speaker 2: --agree with you; I agree.
Speaker 1: I used, I used to wonder sometimes, because once Frank--Frank Rich was new to The New York Times.  The, the main review was new then.  And he needed to make his bona fides, he needed to establish his bona fides.  And he, and, and in particularly in New York [New York] he knew he had to find--I, I hate to put it this way--had to find his nigger, and he found August [Wilson].  And, and there's nothing against August, but from his standpoint, he found his, you know.  He, he didn't want to deal with his predecessors' (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --niggers.  You know, he didn't want--
Speaker 2: --to discover--
Speaker 1: He didn't, he didn't wanna deal. See--
Speaker 2: See (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Joe Walker [Joseph A. Walker] was still--Clive Barnes' and Mel Gussow's niggers (laughter), put it crudely.  He had to find his own, and he found August.  And he made sure that that paper backed him up every so--there were feature articles I mean galore.  I couldn't believe it.  And still the white public didn't make it run.  It ran, like you say, describe 'Bessie' ['The Death of Bessie Smith,' Edward Albee] when it first opened, and people, the, the, the church group.  The, the theater parties has kept 'Fences' alive for the first three months.  And most of the theater part is based on what, what people I had trained at the NEC [Negro Ensemble Company] on my staff and many of 'em that got trained well enough that they went independent and, and began to organize their own theater party service (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, now, now let--
Story_ID: 277233
Speaker 1: Let me ask you since we're on that, on the role of AUDELCO [Audience Development Committee, Inc.].  I know Hazel Joan Bryant (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and AUDELCO and the, you know, it seems to me like an extraordinary kind of a pioneering effort to get back, you know, black theatrical productions and you know.  What do you, what do you have to say about that?
Speaker 2: I never paid much, and, and, and I shouldn't be--I'm, I'm not negative about it.  It's just that what I'm describing to you and what we did internally, independently in developing an audience and we, the NEC [Negro Ensemble Company] was so far advanced in, in all of these areas, till, till what AUDELCO was doing was, was, was, was still like minor to us.  We were beyond where they were, and they, they never, you know, they, what they could do never generated--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --enough for us.  Whatever they did that was helpful to, to the, the total black theater community is fine.  But, no--
Speaker 1: Now what does it stand for--Audience Development something (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, but that--
Speaker 1: I mean they were trying to develop audience for black theater in New York [New York] and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but that, yeah, that's fine.  All that shit is fine on paper.  We're doing that shit.  I got people on my fucking staff.  I got developer people on my staff doing it directly.  That's why I'm saying that eventually the people I paid on my staff to do this work became so expert at it till they went out, and, and, and, and by the time the black audience had been identified and reached through theater parties, the churches, all of that, that which is we had pioneered, no, we did that long before, before AUDELCO existed.  And AUDELCO never was contributing.  I mean it never was like--whatever, whatever AUDELCO was doing was providing the--no, we, we independently.  Like, '[The] River Niger,' [Joseph A. Walker] at that time, it was still the, the poverty program period, you know, the [President Lyndon Baines] Johnson period and all of that shit.  So, we, through our staff, through my staff, the reason why I didn't, say I didn't pay much attention to what AUDELCO did because we were doing that individually independent directly from our staff, you know, and so forth.  And eventually, as I said, some people got so adept at it, till by the time these Broadway shows came up and the white producers began to, to find out (laughter) that they could exploit a black audience as much as they could, that's when the, the people that I had on my staff went out and independent.  That's when they developed the theater party.  That was very helpful for the first three months of, of, of 'Fences,' [August Wilson] but, once again, it's finite.  That couldn't last too long.  The white people still held out.  And with all of this, this, this avalanche of publicity and everything that was given to them by The New York Times, the white people still didn't, didn't, didn't come out.  They gave it every fucking award.  They still (laughter), they still didn't.  I jokingly say sometimes cynically that finally--I think it was maybe about a, the, the Tony [Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Theatre] or whatever--finally-the Pulitzer [Prize for Drama], I think it was a Pulitzer--finally when the, I said oh, fuck it.  The white people finally gave up.  I said they gave up; they gave in.  They said we've been battered to death, and they finally gave, gave in and, and, and, and, and started coming out a little more because by that time it had been made an event.  See, in American culture, if someone comes to an event, it means that you have to do it.  You have to go see it because everybody in the office gon' be talking about it around the coffee, the, the, the water cooler.  You may not want to go see it.  You have no interest in this nigger play.  But anyway, well, shit, everybody talking about I gotta go, you know, see it.  So, it became an event.  Finally, they sustained it for a little while longer.  It still didn't run more than three more months.  Still I mean, if with all of the publicity that 'Fence' got, 'Fences' should still be running on ordinary terms.  If this had been Neil Simon and not just even a, you know, a more, more, more serious even recognized play, playwright, it would be, it would still be running.  But the mistake, see, the mistake, talking about little, little 'Bessie' ['The Death of Bessie Smith,' Edward Albee] once they, it wasn't once they moved.  Eventually, as I said, that audience, that a natural audience could not be, couldn't replicated constantly.  It's a finite, you know, with--like, like it or not, we, we don't, you know, we ain't got that much money for a long period of time, so we can exhaust our natural public over a period of time, whether it's short or long.
Story_ID: 276628
Speaker 1: 'Niger' ['The River Niger,' Joseph A. Walker] really represented a watershed, to a certain extent, in terms of proving our double-edged commitment, both to sustaining our pro, our, our program as, as, as it was without changing anything in terms of our regular program and taking advantage for pragmatic purposes or possibilities outside that even our own, our own space and, and, and, and size a theater couldn't even accommodate.  We didn't, we never considered going to Broadway, going to Broadway for any other reason except it would expand our regular program.  I mean it extended everything rather than Broadway as a thing in itself, I mean some starry-eyed idea of Broadway.  Artistically, I never even thought of it that way because hey, Broadway, even by then, had not, had ceased to be a place where serious work was being even done that much or was even comfortable.  The, the best artistic work was still off-Broadway, where we were already, so I was not, going to Broadway didn't mean anything.  But, hey, it helped, it helped in its own way.  It through back some profit to a certain extent for, into the regular operation but not, you know, not commensurate with some of what, what happened with Joe Papp [Joseph Papp] and all of 'em where sometimes, hey, the profits he got from '[A] Chorus Line' or, or, or, or the couple of things that he did on Broadway pretty much ran, paid for his whole operation.  No, we didn't, we didn't, we didn't have that.  But anyway, it proved that we could sustain our credibility in terms that our regular program of being, developing a permanent institution.  The NEC's [Negro Ensemble Company] purpose was to create an institution of, of, institution of training program, a presentation of a professional works, the development of professionals, a place for their permanent utilization in challenging material and everything else.  That's what it, what it was, it was to be, and what it remained for thirty years or so.  It remained a dominant, almost a dominant, one of the dominance theater practitioners in theater, consistent, and the record of it, you know, in terms of like, the, the variety of, of works it did.  The, the, the, the talent it produced is now, we know now and see it in all over the place in, in so many ways, not just the actors, but talent in every phase of theater.  I mean we broke many of the union, got people in the union that blacks had not been into in, in terms of behind-the-scenes unions, the stage managers, and the managers, and the press agents unions, and all--ushers, and designers, all of those.
Story_ID: 276629
Speaker 1: NEC [Negro Ensemble Company] started as an equity theater.  Did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah.  NEC, no, the whole point, point, well, no, we, we, no, the whole point was, me, Gerry [Gerald Krone], and, and Bobby [HistoryMaker Robert Hooks] would not have devoted ourselves to anything else but a professional company.  And we were lucky the times, that, that the times were propitious and we got support for it.  But when we went to the Ford Foundation [New York, New York] and, and made a proposal to them after they invited us to do it, hey, we made a proposal to create a permanent, professional operation that was also combined with, with a major training program and, and so forth.  And, and that's what it remained.  And for the, its, its glory period for almost thirty years it remained consistent in that mission.  Now, as things went wrong, things got more difficult in terms of, of, of sustaining the operation with, with, with, you know, budgetary consideration.  And finally we got, we got almost destroyed by the change in the political climate because, as I said,  we became not our fault, but we found out that, hey, our main budget had to be--once, once, they changed the tax laws, so they, you weren't allowed.  No nonprofit institution was allowed to get more than 33--a third percent of their budget from any foundation let's say.  So we could not do what we did in the first three years where we, we were totally supported by Ford.  But we then were forced to go into a fundraising mode.  We, suddenly we discovered during that time that we didn't, a black project didn't have the same access, the same sort of independent money from corporations and businesses.  And we still hadn't reached the point where we were able to exploit on a smaller scale the money possibly from, from our own, our own black public, you know.  And ultimately one of, one of, one of the, the saddest things was, was that the, some of the black money that did exist didn't find culture a priority; you know, they got more, more, more mileage out of giving it to social cultural--I mean social and educative things and so forth.  Bill Cosby gave what? Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] $10 million, something like that, when actually the actors that he was using on his own program (laughter), he was getting more actors from uh, from me, from the NEC, than he was getting from Spelman.  I mean, but see, but hey, you, he got--you get more publicity by giving it to somebody like, you know, Spelman.  Anyway, that--
Speaker 1: People, the public thinks, eh, they, they, they, they often think, well, you know, we got crime in the streets (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right--
Speaker 1: --a lot of people starving.  And, and then you get with these guys and their just doing, their doing theater, you know (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it, it's not a, it wasn't a priority.  I eventually tried to appeal to 'em to say I know it's not a priority.  Give, don't, don't stop giving money away, give it, but begin to give money back to your field.  See, for, for, for Denzel [Washington] and for some of the, the NEC alumni who became, you know, wealthy enough, my thing was: hey, look, I'm not asking you not to stop giving, you know.  Denzel give it to the boy's club or give it to his minister, I, I, I don't have no problem with that, but you gotta give something back to your own field, you know.  If you don't, why should a larger public do it?  You can't go to white folks and ask them to give you, you know, money when you, you can't show that Bill and Denzel and Sam or somebody who they look and say did you get any money from them?  And if you say no, then they say well, why should I give it?  Anyway, but, the difficulty over the years, and I don't have time and won't go through all of the, the stratagems and, and, and maneuvers that I sustained in keeping things going, sometimes with no money.
Story_ID: 276630
Speaker 1: I mean I'm only laughing 'cause there are a couple of productions that the public never knew that they were not lesser works or anything, but I had to substitute 'em because the size was different from what I had planned, you know.  And one, one particular program I did with no money was a program that suddenly was my own play, a short play of mine.
Speaker 2: Which was--
Speaker 1: A, a play called 'The Redeemer' [Douglas Turner Ward].  But it was still too short.  I had to find a companion piece.  I, I went through my files and found this play and turned out (laughter) has the play--taking place on a bus with four characters.  My play called for six characters, and, and, and they ran--you know, there were what, what? Three whites and three blacks or something.  So I found another play that could use the same people.  And I still didn't have enough time, so I found a one-man play that I was the one man.  I directed the whole thing.  I got some, some flats that were upstairs in the building that you make, make a, a reasonable set with some--all I need are some benches; my, my play was outdoors anyway.  So, all of this I did, as I said, for nothing.  Now everybody said, "Well, Jesus, you know, Doug's [HistoryMaker Douglas Turner Ward] all over," and I said, "Yeah, because I work cheap."  I didn't have to pay myself the option on my (laughter) play; I didn't have to pay myself for the director fee; I didn't have to pay my--the only thing I had to pay myself on, on the paper was the actors thing because it's a union job, but other than that I got, I got a, a, a, very decent production on that nobody even saw the nature and, and the, the, the, the quality of the production, you, you didn't blink.  It was just good NEC [Negro Ensemble Company] stuff.  But nobody know that I, hey, this was done because I, we were out of money (laughter) you know, it was done.  This particular choice was made because we were out of money.  Anyway, all the, all, all of those years and finally our real last major stuff was, was the, the, the, the production of, of Charles Fuller's 'WE' series, we, the 'WE' plays, which was a historical play that started at the, the onset of the Civil War and ended in the, the Reconstruction period before plays.  Prince ['WE - Prince'], Sally ['WE - Sally'], Jonquil ['WE - Jonquil'], and, and Burner's Frolic ['WE - Burner's Frolic'], those are, you know.  And by that time, I had stepped out of my artistic director's thing, but I was still instrumental in, in getting these works done and directed all of them.  And, but by that time it was almost like me saying look, hey, I don't care what our circumstances are, but we have to still do meaningful work.  And what's more meaningful than a Charles Fuller, you know, new plays by Charles Fuller and who you--so this, this epic project unfortunately, the, the, you know, the white critical establishment, you know, didn't deal with it like they should've.  And at that time it wasn't like we needed it for the public, but back, but at, at that point in our time, history, and economic situation, if they had treated these works to the degree that they should have, at least it would have given the sense of major importance to 'em that we could have exploited and used in our own way.  But they didn't, and finally we did some, couple of decent things after the 'WE' plays.  I think we did a wonderful production of, of, of, of, a monologue evening by Gus [Edwards] called 'Lifetimes on the Street.'  And, and I think we, we, we, we finally did a, a, a play 'Last Nite at Ace High' [Kenneth Hoke-Witherspoon] in the early '90s [1990s].  But by that time, it's obvious that, that our, our, our program financially was in trouble.
Story_ID: 276631
Speaker 1: Finally the, the IRS [Internal Revenue Service] almost put a nail in the coffin by--we always had been able to, let's say, be behind a quarter, and they allowed us over the years, you know, whenever we got--but finally they decided to not give us that.  You know, it's like want (laughter), we want you to pay on time, right, this quarter at a--'course we couldn't do it, and, and, and therefore, for the first time in our history we had to stop.  There was nothing I could do.  There was nothing I could do.  To, to put on a production for nothing, we didn't have, we couldn't, we, we didn't have no, we couldn't move because, you know, the, the--
Speaker 2: Instead of the government subsidizing you--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --the government actually stops you.
Speaker 1: Oh, absolutely.  This, this was, this was, this--
Speaker 2: In what, what year is this?
Speaker 1: This was close to, it, it started, yeah, it, it, it started in the early '90s [1990s], you know, around '91 [1991], '92 [1992], around that time, and it became, you know.  I had thought (laughter), probably, after twenty years of, of, of the NEC [Negro Ensemble Company] I thought that I could kick myself upstairs and go on.  In fact, I was supposed to take a sabbatical.  And just when I was supposed to take a sabbatical is when the, the money crunch came.  And I couldn't nowhere, and I had, had to stay on.  And I had turned it over to Leon Denmark, and it, and therefore I, I felt guilty in leaving him with, with, with, you know, in, in, in, in a straitened circumstance, so I stayed on to help him through the, you know, the early periods when he took over.  And finally, after the WE's--'WE' plays [Charles Fuller], which, which finally was, was my recommendation that, that he accept it and did.  And we, we did a wonderful job with him, and they were wonderful plays.  As, as I said, they, they were not received like they should have in, in the New York [New York] context.  See, but we have a marvelous time 'cause we took 'em on a tour.  And like, for instance, we did all four of those plays in one day at Iowa, Iowa University [The University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa].  We started at ten and, and ended at one in the morning with, with a, a, a, a break for dinner.  We did two of 'em and then break for dinner and did, did the other two in the same day.  It was wonderful, a wonderful, wonderful project.  But that sort of was the period, that whole period, the last stages of, from the late '80s [1980s] into the early '90s [1990s]; that was, that was, that was a very difficult period.  And finally, we couldn't overcome the deficit problem.  And even though, you know, what the NEC on record still exists, but the NEC doesn't exist unless it's doing major work or able to do major work.  It can't be like piddling around with, with little infrequent, once-in-while production at, at a lesser quality result.  The NEC was, was too important in terms of its, its level of operation and quality of operation for anything else to, to, to, to consider itself, you know, comparable.
Speaker 2: It's a, it's a brand now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, absolutely.  And, and, and when that brand is not operation or functioning right, it's not, it's not there.  It's just, you know, it makes--it'll be, be on record in a way, but it, that's not, you know, that's not able.
Story_ID: 276632
Speaker 1: The interesting thing about that is that I had made a proposal to the, lot of peop- NEC [Negro Ensemble Company] people, that the only thing that could have revived it, and black theater to a certain extent, is the Haitian plays.  And I came up with a proposal that if they were able to, as I said, the, the NEC alumni, if the NEC alumni could have gotten together, raised the money, we needed about $500,000 just, just, just, just to--'cause the, the, the, the, the plays have to be done not full-scale, but even a major reading of 'em is, is, is, costs more than most regular productions.
Speaker 2: Okay, now these are, this is the Haitian trilogy that you wrote (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, the Haitian trilogy.  Yeah, as I've, as I've said, the, I thought I was gonna cover the whole history.
Speaker 2: Of the Haitian Revolution?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Haitian Revolution.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But the works were so vast and, and, and so forth till I only got, I got past the first two, which still constitute almost more than ten, eleven hours of theater, in just, just treating the period of, of, of Toussaint's [Toussaint L'Ouverture] rule.  And then finally I ran out, you know, I, I, I exhausted that, that form and thought that, I said okay, shit, that's, that's enough for a life work, I mean, you know, over almost a fifteen, twenty year period of ten hours of theater, not bad you know, epic's canvass and so forth.  So I was satisfied and so forth.  Now, and then a year or so, yeah, yeah, maybe a couple of years passed and I said okay that's good; I'm satisfied with what I've done and accomplished.  I, I sat out--I, I didn't cover the whole territory, but it, you know, it's still worthy.  And then I woke up and said oh, I know.  I can't go back to that form, the epic form, that huge canvass.  I've exhausted that, but I'll just go the opposite direction.  And it, and I became, I, I'll write a one-man play.  And, and of course it occurred to me because as, as I said to you earlier in the day, the one who always attracted me, of course, was the one who the world always (laughter) hate, and that's [Jean-Jacques] Dessalines.  But for some reason, you know, my, I identified with him.  So the fact that I identified with him so much, I said okay, not only form-wise, it's the opposite of the two big (unclear) playing.  But I also, I have a personal attachment to him.
Story_ID: 276633
Speaker 1: What is that attachment, and, and why is Dessalines, why do you think Jean-Jacques Dessalines is so despised as a historical figure (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because in conventional, almost sentimental terms, we're all wedded to, even our so-called great men, they could have flaws.  But they must have some redeeming qualities to them.  We're not ready to just accept the, the greatness of their achievement.  There's no denying Dessalines was absolutely one of the most brilliant generals of that whole group, natural, natural ruler, general, is a warrior.  See, Dessalines was a warrior, but his, outside of his warrior nature and warrior instincts, and brilliance, and, and tactical, and the strategic stuff as a warrior, he, in conventional ways, didn't live up to some clean image (laughter) that we wanna imply, you know.  But what attracted me to it is precisely not the flaw.  I don't consider flaws but the fact that, hey, he--I have a line in the play which says like: "Of course I'm, I'm more ready to fight."  You know, I'm, you know, I enjoy, I'm--fighting is what I do, and that's when I'm happy, I, more happy to fight.  He said, "But combat suspend now.  I need special attention to keep me interested."  And as it turned out, the two things that he's interested in is fucking and dancing. Well, those two things, I mean, theatrically, what, what can attract a writer or an actor more (laughter) than--got this big, burly, you know, brute of a man suddenly, you know, shit, and one, one, once he, once he ruled, he, he, he's not interested too much in the, the statesman thing.  That was, that was Toussaint [L'Ouverture], and I finally got Toussaint's ass arrested, you know, being such a statesman and being so conflicted between his, you know, the independent thing and, and, and, and, and, and the objective and, and, and, and being attached to France.  See, Toussaint never could imagine himself not being attached to France.  Dessalines was the opposite.  Dessalines said fuck France.  And that, and, and, and I use his, his own words.  At the end of one, one, one scene where, where, where, when he declares the independence of Haiti--
Speaker 1: So, so--
Speaker 2: And he said me and thirty-six general officers got together and go naive and declare the independence of Haiti, "Haiti, yes, Haiti, Haiti, Haiti, the land of mountains, what the first people call it before any man set a foot on it and the white man set foot on it, before any black man was dragged off the boat on it, before any yellow breed was yanked out of his Negro mama's wound on it, Haiti, Haiti.  We swear to posterity, to the universe, to the heavens to renounce France forever and to die rather than give into her, to, to fight till our last breath went out, before living under her domination.  Curses upon the French name, everlasting hate to France and her dominion."  And that, that, that, that was the moment.  That, that, that was that moment when he declared it.  On the 1st of January, 1804, he declared the independence of Haiti.
Speaker 1: Do you try to use some of the original dialogue from the 18, early 1800s (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, what I do, no--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: --I take-
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: --great liberty, but I, I keep the sense of it.
Speaker 1: Well, the original, you know, a lot of it, he's quoted a lot in those days and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but from passages.  Yeah, I will take like passages from it.  Like, this is, this, this is actually his own statement at the meeting of the thirty-six generals and officers.
Story_ID: 276634
Speaker 1: So now you're doing a one-man show (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: -on [Jean-Jacques] Dessalines.  And, and, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, not, not--
Speaker 1: --we, we were just saying off-camera how--
Speaker 2: --finally--
Speaker 1: --dramatic all the stories of those characters, Toussaint [L'Ouverture], Dessalines--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --[Henri] Christophe.
Speaker 2: Well, the interesting thing, after I finished with the Dessalines' one, and I started, say okay, it will be four plays.  I started on Christophe, and I did some excellent writing.  And then I realized that despite all of the, the, the, the excellent writing, that thematically I had covered the territory, that through the first, through Toussaint and Dessalines, that in trying to deal with, I could deal with the practical history (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --of, of Christophe, but I, but I'd already, I had already covered the, the major thematic elements of the whole thing, because all, all it had with Christophe is a repeat, the mulatto problem.  See, the mulatto problem was, was throughout, 'cause actually, you know, as you know, that Dessalines (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --was, was, was, the, the ambush was really (laughter) organized by--
Speaker 1: Yeah, [Alexandre] Petion, yeah--
Speaker 2: Petion and so forth.
Speaker 1: --and, and another guy, [Jean-Pierre] Boyer--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Bo, well, Boyer, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But, Christophe comes on and then, of course, by this time was ahead of the, then established the republic.  They could not accept--see, the biggest tragedy of the Haitian Revolution is they could not accept--the mulattos could not accept the natural leadership of the black, of, of blacks, not in, in our American way of cla- you know.  As you know, in, in Haiti mulattos were a separate class, not just, it wasn't just a racial thing; they were a separate class.  They had a, you know, there was the middle thing.  They had the special rules.  In fact, I start the play, the first play, off with, with all of the listing of the special rules, like what we would call discriminate, discrimination-type rules: you must not do this; you must wear this; you can't ride in this; you so forth, so it almost (unclear) and they thought that they were on the verge of, of--with, with--attached to the French Revolution.  They, they, they, they thought, okay, they finally got it made.  They black slavery boat came and surprised all of 'em.  You know, they got surprised, but the mulattos never accepted--I have in, in the earlier plays.
Speaker 1: Not to mention the whites (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I have whole scenes.
Speaker 1: --and the whole white world--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah--
Speaker 1: --never accepted the black--
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely--
Speaker 1: --black rule, you know--
Speaker 2: Oh no, I'm not fucking--
Speaker 1: --(unclear)--
Speaker 2: I'm not even interested in, in, in even that, the white thing, that was just war against war.  But for the mulattos, they were in and out.  Like even, even the, the, Petion became, you know, the, the top man during Christophe rule.  Petion was, was Toussaint's lieutenant and, oh, and, and Dessalines and, when Dessalines takes over its two lieutenants.  He says Jean-Jacques Dessalines, governor-general with Petion, with Christophe and Petion beside beside me.  He, when Dessalines was in power, Christophe was in charge, control up north, Petion in the west, which is Port-au-Prince [Haiti], and another mulatto general, General [Andre] Rigaud in the south, which was the, the, the, going, you know, that, that one that's going out into the, the water, at the end.
Story_ID: 276635
Speaker 1: And  [Alexandre] Petion had fought brilliantly with, with Toussaint [L'Ouverture] and, but he, he was always the, his loyalty, it's also the loyalty to his class (laughter).  I mean he couldn't overcome that, and he finally then turned against [Henri] Christophe.  And of course, that, that was the, the signal when they, when, when, when France then exploited.
Speaker 2: So you think, do you think the atmosphere now with the earthquake in Haiti and the, all the attention on Haiti is a good--I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The, the, the tragedy of Haiti, the ha- the tragedy of Haiti is that we know and you know--you, you say you study--it started then, where I say it started after Chris, Christophe was defeated.   And mulattos couldn't rule, but they installed (laughter) figureheads and horrible dudes, and the country just went total in decline.  And that, and that, and that thing, the, the, the debt, the debt that France extracted.  Everybody talks about Haiti being, Haiti's in, in, on life support because (laughter) France ex- France extracted debt money from 'em--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --after, af- after (laughter) enslaving 'em and--
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) fighting 'em, and then--
Speaker 2: --and [Jean-Pierre] Boyer has accepted the deal for--
Speaker 1: Yes, that's what I'm saying. That's what I'm fucking saying, the fucking mulattos not, not supporting Christophe, then made that deal.  And that's why they have--so, the decline, it was (unclear) precipitous till everybody ask me now, I say like, I grieve for, for what's, what Haiti is now, but the, the potential air in, in terms of where, where it was in the [Haitian] Revolution and, and since is just so, so, so, so abominably different till, till they not the same place to me, (laughter) you know, I mean not the same place.
Speaker 2: So can (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Can you imagine what, what could have happened if, if, if, if Haiti had been, been allowed to, to, to its own potential development?  Instead of the poorest country (laughter) in the world, it would be like--I mean we don't know.  It might have been, you know, a lesson for, for all of us, for the whole world, but instead it just turned into the opposite.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Yet it's still one of the most defining, finally, as you say about history, finally people are beginning to accept that and even regular historians now.  Everybody's beginning--what we talked about earlier--everybody's beginning to realize that America as America with, with that, that Louisiana Purchase thing, that, hey, the slave revolt in Haiti is the thing that caused Napoleon [Bonaparte] to sell that territory to [President Thomas] Jefferson for nothing, gave it to him almost because he was stymied, you know, stymied in by those revolutionaries, you know, black revolutionaries.
Story_ID: 276636
Speaker 1: We've talked about so much, but as we close out, three questions I need to ask you.  And the first one is, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: My basic hope and con, concern for the African community is one that's, that's I guess consistent from, from my youth, and I hope that the African American community and the black community will, will, will unite not under, not, not under some, some individual messiah but unite as a collective community and seriously confront a system that's still not to our benefit, despite the fact that we may have quote a black president.  See, my idea in terms of--no, no, no, no disrespect for, for, for [HistoryMaker President Barack] Obama, but my idea: anybody who become president of the United States, whether it's a black, (laughter) a lesbian, or, a, a, a gay, transvestite, anybody become president of the United States is going to, to pra- possibly and probably hold the line of the main thrust of the system.  And the main thrust of the system is still empire.  I, I won't, you know, we don't have to go into all of the details of that.  So, having a black president or the other kind is not the answer.
Story_ID: 276637
Speaker 1: But as I said, the collective community addressing the issues that, that, the major issues that confront us, I mean like the, how many of the percentages of all our young men in jail and, and all, all of the, the, the massive problems that we still have.  I don't care about what advances individual blacks have made or either the well-off position or the, or the emerging black middle class or whatev- these things only cover up the fact that in many ways the masses of our people are in direr straits (laughter) than they were back a, almost a century ago in, in, in many ways.  So I, I'm just, I'm just hoping that the struggle continues in terms of us unifying and collectively getting together to address those issues in a real way and not depend on any individual or any, any, any vote for any, any individual no matter what, ha, what height they reach.
Story_ID: 276638
Speaker 1: When you look back over all your body of work to this point, what would you consider to be your legacy, and is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: No, the, the answer to the last part of it is that (laughter) I would say no.  I mean--I don't think there's anything I would do, do different.  I'm quite satisfied with, with, with the opportunities that I was given and how I carried them out.  And I think that it will take the world and others to judge, you know, the sufficiency of, of what I did and, and, and the worth of it.  But, but I'm quite confident that already the result of, of, of my efforts and so forth have already registered through the work of others.  As I always tell my, my people who work with me, that's always about the work.  And I think that eventually it's the work that is going to determine the judgment, you know, and, and the enduring aspect--the nature of that work.
Story_ID: 276639
Speaker 1: You mentioned your family earlier, earlier and trying to make sure you always had time to spend during the summer (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --at Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts].  Can you tell us about your children and your, your--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, my, my--I have two children.  My daughter [Elizabeth Ward Cuprill] just presented me with my third (laughter) grandchild, Nico [ph.].  And I have two other grandchildren, Kobe [ph.] and, and, and Anaya [ph.].  My daughter, as I said, just, you know, is, is very a wonderful, you know, person, lady, and works for the, the federal government as, in the parole section.  She's a parole officer and, and, and, and so forth.  I know when she became part of the system and so forth, I say well, I say, "Wait a minute, wait a minute, you, you, you my daughter.  You gonna be a police woman or what have you?"  And she said, "No, daddy.  You know I'm--." She finished mass- got a master's [degree] in social.  She said, "No (laughter), no I'm still, I'm still using whatever the jobs to try to help some folks," and I, I believe her.  I said, "That's cool, okay" (laughter).  And she, and, and she does.  I know she, she, whatever the people that she has to be over and so forth, she still try to help 'em to do better with their lives.  But anyway, my son is, is very interesting, very, very, very, very interesting young man, a combination, he's a personal trainer on one hand.  He also is, is, is working in voiceovers and so forth, and very talented, and you know, very, very interesting.  In fact, he and I like sort of meet twice a week.  Well, today is Wednesday.  We met last night, and tomorrow we meet Thursday, go out to the bar and have a drink.  And he wants to talk about world affairs and, and the whole thing, but he's very interesting, very intelligent, and very interesting, very committed, a dyed in wood jazz lover (laughter), you know, and so forth, like which I am.  And I'm thankful that I was responsible during those years on the Martha's Vineyard, 'cause I always surrounded myself with, with bur, well, you know, with, with Miles [Davis] and Bird [Charles Parker] and (laughter), and, and [Thelonious] Monk also.  It, it's carried over to him in particular.  It's all my, my, my daughter, all, although she's a little more into the, the more contemporary stuff.  But he's a, you know, he's committed to, to, to, to the jazz aspect.  And hey, they, they, they're wonderful, wonderful people.  They're growing up wonderful people.  They're both intelligent, and, and sensitive, and interested, you know, in, in, in the world and the, the world affairs and so forth.  And my grandchildren, you know, are very, very, very, very, growing up to be very, very nice children, you know.
Speaker 1: Now are you still married, or did you--
Speaker 2: No, my wife and I are, are best friends. In fact, sometimes, the children say, "Why did, why did you all break up?  You seem to be more best friends now than when you were, when you married," which is, is, is not quite true, but it, it, on, on, on one level it, it seems that way because, you know, we are very friendly, and therefore, like for instance, you know, being the family, we still, like, do it as a family.  I mean even though she and I are not together anymore, but as I said, we, we remain good friends.  Diana [Powell Ward], she, and, and she was very much--I have to give her a lot of credit for whatever I've done, because if it wasn't for her acceptance of, of my choices and, and, and so forth, I wouldn't have been able to do it, you know.  And in, in a lot of ways my choices, you know, not put a strain, but my choices did affect the family situation because, hey, I made a choice that was (laughter), kept me permanently poor, you know.  But no, we took, we took care of the children well.  And I, I was always did well enough to, to give them a shot by giving them a good education and everything else.  And, and, but you know, we, we, we never were gonna get rich (laughter), especially with the choice I made, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, theater is a consuming type of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, but, but also the fact that, hey, if I had been interested in it, whatever was out there, if I had been interested in, in, in a commercial career, whatever is out there, I would have got my share of it, of my generation.  I mean I, I know that and, and the, even the times when, when, you know, when I had major offers I couldn't take 'em 'cause I chose to, to not tie myself up in anything that was gonna take me away from running the [Negro Ensemble] Company.
Story_ID: 276640
Speaker 1: Now the last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Through my work, that's all, you know, whatever be remembered, whatever I did work-wise.  That's, that's the only thing that matters to me, you know.  I mean I have no overriding thing about (laughter) how I'm remembered, you know, in a way.  But I, I hope that, that the legacy of my work will be passed on to other generations and maybe inspire them to make similar choices in avoiding, you know, the more glittering char, choice, choices for a more solid, (laughter) you know, meaningful, in depth choices, particularly in, in, in terms of, of artistic ambition.
