Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today with the HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Ma'am can you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Norma Adams-Wade, N-O-R-M-A, A-D-A-M-S hyphen W-A-D-E.
Speaker 1: And ma'am what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Now may I be blunt?  Do I have to answer date of birth, I don't answer that, you can do some math.  I grew up in the '60s [1960s] but I mean if I just have to but I really prefer not to give date of birth.
Speaker 1: We can't make you do it but I always ask the question because this is an oral history project.
Speaker 2: Right, well I'm going to let the viewers do the math.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you give us your place of birth?
Speaker 2: Dallas, Texas and I always say I'm one of the last three remaining, original Dallasites because so many people here have come in from other places and I specifically remember when the migration really started which was in the '80s [1980s].  So I say I'm one of the last three remaining original Dallasites.
Speaker 1: Right, migration to the sunbelt.
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely.
Speaker 1: So what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: I am a writer and the title would be retired senior staff writer for the Dallas Morning News and currently a columnist.  And forgive me I'm going to cough through this conversation because I've got a little allergy thing going on.
Speaker 1: That's fine and ma'am what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Oh gosh I haven't taken time to think of the date today.  Okay today is-today is (laugh) March the 6th and this is 2014.
Speaker 1: That's right and where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: Okay we're in Dallas, Texas.
Speaker 1: In the?
Speaker 2: In the sunbelt?  In the Dallas Morning News building.  I got three answers, right?
Story_ID: 42140
Speaker 1: Yes, okay now before we go in depth there are five light weight questions we always ask.  It's kind of a warm up and they only require short answers.  The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Spaghetti and corn bread.
Speaker 1: Okay do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yellow
Speaker 1: Okay, a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Spring
Speaker 1: Favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Anywhere that would be sort of like a country setting in a building with a big wide porch with seating.  Oh gosh that's my ideal and I'm a city girl but give me a rural porch with chairs, I'm in heaven.
Speaker 1: Okay and do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: It has been ever thus, is the saying.  It has been ever thus. I have a second too, the second is I remember that former UN [United Nations] Ambassador Adlai Stevenson was quoted as saying to some graduates, and as you leave this place remember why you came.  That spoke to my soul and in that addresses is my approach to life.  I try to remember why I came to this profession and that's what keeps me going, remembering why I came to do what I do, so that's a favorite.
Speaker 1: Okay I was going to remember to ask you about that when we get to your career choice.
Story_ID: 42141
Speaker 1: Now I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side but separately and then we'll put them together.  So can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Nettie, N-E-T-T-I-E, Ruth, R-U-T-H, IVORY, I-V-O-R-Y and then when she married she became Adams, A-D-A-M-S.
Speaker 1: And what is her--what was her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: September 26, 1921
Speaker 1: Was she born in Dallas [Texas] too?
Speaker 2: She was born in Naples, N-A-P-L-E-S, Texas which is in East Texas.
Speaker 1: Now what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them and what are the stories that come down from that side?
Speaker 2: Well, okay I can talk to you about her mother who was Lucy, L-U-C-Y, Miller, M-I-L-L-E-R and when she married she became Ivory, I-V-O-R-Y and I can't--there were just stories about her mom.  Lucy was my grandmother so actually I'm blanking out on her mother's name but I have known it and then, of course, my mother's father Sim, S-I-M, Ivory, I-V-O-R-Y and his mom was Alice Miller.  I think that there were a lot of Millers on both sides. And his dad was Gif, G-I-F, Ivory.  That's as far back as I can go.  So those would be my--what great grandparents?
Speaker 1: Yeah, those would be your great, great grandparents, Alice Miller and Gif Ivory.  Now that would take us back well let me see, your mother was born in '21 [1921].
Speaker 2: Yeah, that would be into slavery.
Speaker 1: Yeah into the nineteenth century anyway, late nineteenth century.  So possibly that could have been during slavery.
Speaker 2: Yeah they were and I did all of that anyway I did all of that genealogy stuff and I filed it away somewhere at home and it's there and I can't find it but it's--because I'm a pack rat so--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Story_ID: 42142
Speaker 1: So were they [great-grandparents, maternal] born in slavery days, Gif Ivory and his wife [Alice Miller]?
Speaker 2: Yes they were. They were.
Speaker 1: So are there any stories that come down from that time?
Speaker 2: Oh gosh the stories, the stories--well none that come to mind but I tell you this, my mother [Nettie Ivory Adams] and her sister are Alice [Ivory] who was named for grandparent would sit on my grandmother's porch and they would tell family stories and it was always about East Texas though.  And, I do remember them talking about my [maternal] grandmother, Lucy [Ivory] coming here from somewhere in Louisiana, Shreveport somewhere in the Shreveport area.  Sim [Ivory] my [maternal] grandfather--I don't remember them saying--I don't remember them talking about where he came from.  And, you know just rural stories, my grandfather who ended up in East Texas did have a still, you know they used to make corn liquor and they would tell a lot of stories about my dad going off in the woods making the corn liquor and that he was pretty good at it and people would come and buy it from him and my mom and her sister were--there were six, two girls and four boys and the boys learned how to do the still.  They all ended up being drinkers and there were family stories, you know, about that.  And then, of course, most of the family stories are from East--on that side of the family are about life in rural East Texas.  Then the stories of my mom, well, the family coming to Dallas and of my mom enrolling in high school in Dallas and meeting my dad [Frank McCleod Adams], those type of stories.
Speaker 1: You have some interesting stories.  I know in East Texas, East Texas is kind of like Oklahoma and Kansas the fact that they are all black towns founded--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: So many Dallas blacks are here from East Texas.  I mean tons of families are in Dallas from East Texas; their roots go to East Texas.  Why that migration thing happened, I don't know.  I guess--well I guess I do know because the jobs were here so the trend would be you grow up in East Texas and you know, work the farm and then when you became of age when you wanted to do a little better Dallas was the site and so that started and my family did the same thing.  And so, when my mom and her parents arrived here, my grandfather Sim found some kind of factory work, he worked in a factory and my grandmother was a domestic and then the children went to the local schools and each found--my mother ended up being a beauty operator, hair dresser.  And so, you know, they would work into whatever available jobs were around here in Dallas but they would find work.
Story_ID: 42143
Speaker 1: Now was--what about Juneteenth, did they celebrate Juneteenth  that being an emancipation celebration?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, well it--yeah they did celebrate it.  Now they would never go to Mexia.  Mexia was like when I was growing up, Mexia, Texas was where all the big celebrations were, it's a smaller town.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: I think it's M-E-X-I-A but you'll have to double check that but the pronunciation is--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Mexia, Texas that's where Juneteenth celebrations were held?
Speaker 2: Can you forgive me a minute.  There's a thing where you can but it needed an adaptor so it's just sitting there unused and I'm sitting there in the choir because I sing and I'm thinking I've got to bring an adaptor.  But back to Mexia so growing up the conversations when June would roll around would be people in the community going down to Mexia.  Our family didn't go but there was all this talk around.
Speaker 1: Now what was the significance of Mexia?  Is that where the--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: And I don't know why it's settled in Mexia, I'd have to look that up but it's a traditional Texas blacks' tradition.  It doesn't happen anymore.  What happened was there was big huge drowning, I forget what must have been like in the '70s [1970s] or maybe in the '80s [1980s] and there was some sort of legal problem about it, I think the police got involved but it killed the tradition.  So it is not done anymore--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Let's go back over what that tradition is.
Speaker 2: Well the tradition was at Juneteenth black people, African Americans would congregate at this lake in Mexia and have this big picnic type celebration which was celebrating the news of emancipation coming to Texas and, of course, you know the story is that when Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, the news didn't make it to Texas until two years later in '65 [1865] and so Colonel Granger from the Union Army came down to Galveston [Texas] and stood on the banks of the boat in the river and read the Proclamation and that's how blacks in Texas learned that we were now free.  And June 19th became the celebration day because that's when it was read and every year after that Texas blacks would have this big celebration and it became known as Juneteenth short for June 19th.  And the tradition lasted for ever and so in this area Mexia somehow became the congregation place and there was this big huge celebration there.  You would eat watermelon and drink red soda pop and have all the standard picnic foods and just have a good old time, just a regular celebration of freedom for African Americans.  And like I said, back in whatever period of time it was, I think it was more like the '80s [1980s] this big tragedy happened where several young African American men ended up being drowned.  The police somehow were involved and it just killed the tradition and there's been talk of people trying to resurrect it but it has not happened.  But family traditionally--families and organizations and clubs and what have you all around Texas will have these celebrations on the nineteenth so that's the tradition.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 42144
Speaker 1: Now the reason why I asked about it is because and part of it is Texas to--it was the frontier of slavery in those days, at the time of the Civil War [1861-1865] there may have been slaves further west, I do not know but I know that Texas was seen as a--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well the story from the Dallas [Texas] area is that this Miller family, the early white settlers brought their enslaved Africans with them and there were Arch, A-R-C-H and Charlotte, C-H-A-R-L-O-T-T-E and they were the enslaved Africans who came with these white settlers.  And their descendants became the Miller.  Now I don't know if my grandmother's Millers because my [maternal] grandmother [Lucy Miller Ivory] was a Miller, I don't know if she's in that bunch of Millers but there were a whole lot of black Millers who came--who got the name from their slave owners and Don Patton who is a local African American genealogist here, he is a Miller descendant and he's done a lot of research about the African Americans who came with the white settlers.  He could call the role, he's phenomenal, he really-actually you need to talk to him.
Speaker 1: Is Don Patton?
Speaker 2: Don, like Don, Patton, P-A-T-T-O-N, oh gosh he's a wonderful person, he is just a walking encyclopedia.  I just love him to death.
Speaker 1: He is the local genealogist?
Speaker 2: Yes, right and he has even done stuff like there is now a Miller family park and he got the city of Dallas to--because this land--he found the land that his ancestors owned and worked and worked and worked and finally got the city of Dallas to make it a park and so now it's some of the land that his ancestors owned and it's now called The Miller Family Park.
Story_ID: 42145
Speaker 1: Now this is all significant because in other parts of the country there may be some exceptions but for the most part black people do not celebrate emancipation or had not done it until they heard about Juneteenth and they started and I guess a part of the black consciousness movement in the late '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s] resurrected Juneteenth as a celebration in cities around the country.  So they celebrate Juneteenth now in Washington, DC and Chicago [Illinois]-(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well a lot of that too is because those folks have ties to Texas and so that would have caused that to spread.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but this new kind of consciousness was arising in the late '60s [1960s].  It wasn't really popular or even talk about slavery before then.  So now people--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Absolutely and I think too that has a lot to do with reclaiming heritage.  You know the '60s [1960s] was an era when we started reclaiming ourselves and so that naturally would bring us back to celebrating freedom rather than trying to sweep it under the rug.
Speaker 1: Right that we never had to-(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Blend in exactly--"that never happened".
Speaker 1: So this is interesting history in this part of the country.
Story_ID: 42146
Speaker 1: Now tell us on your mother's [Nettie Ivory Adams] side of the family--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: We haven't talked about my dad's [Frank McLeod Adams] side.
Speaker 1: Not yet but let me just ask you what did your mother--now you said she and your Aunt Alice sat on the porch talking--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh yeah and even--my mom died in '84 [1984] and her sister [Alice Ivory] was about three or four years older and she was very late 80s when she died.  But again, they even in that--at that age still did the porch sitting thing.  Porch sitting was a big thing and I guess that's why I love even though I don't have a porch I want to go in the city and see if I can get--I got a little porch and see if I can extend it because that porch sitting thing is just in me, I love it.  But any way they used to sit on--and it reminds me of Alex Haley journey because he talked about how his family sat on the porch and told all these stories and my mom and her sister, you know would do that, Nettie and Alice.  They called each other sister and they would sit there and comment on people as they walked around the street and if somebody would come down the street and they'd wave at them and then they would start telling stories about that person's family.  So it was just a sharing of community and family and they like I said they did that until the day they died.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. Now what did your mother say about growing up, did she on these porch sessions and stuff, what did you discover about--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: She talked a lot about being a tom boy because she had the four brothers and she would talk about again all of this was in Naples, Texas, East Texas and she just talked about her playing with her brothers and she loved to climb trees and they would wander around.  My [maternal] grandfather [Sim Ivory] was like a sharecropper, he was a sharecropper and so the white land owners and I used to know their names, I'm beginning to forget a lot of stuff but growing up I knew the name of the white family that he sharecropped with and so they would--my mother and her sister would talk about the big house where the white folks were and my grandfather and his six children lived on the land and helped grow crop and stuff on the land where he was a sharecropper.  Then, of course, he had the still off down in the woods but they would talk about my grandmother, Lucy [Lucy Miller Ivory] going to the big house and I guess she must have cleaned or did whatever domestic stuff you do there but they would talk about that and they talked about playing out in the fields and at the lake on the land or the body of water that was on the land and growing stuff and the chickens and the stuff like that.  They would just talk farm type stuff, rural existence and going into town and being on the wagons because they--I don't know how long they kept this wagon.  My grandfather never had a car but he did a lot of driving the wagon.
Speaker 1: Was that a wagon pulled by a horse or mule?
Speaker 2: Yeah and they would talk about that-(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: It's important to say that now because so many people watching this in the future are not going to know anything about that.  You didn't think about it being special then but nowadays I know how much of a wagon my son (unclear).
Story_ID: 42147
Speaker 1: And then you'd go under the trees and sometimes the trees would slap you in the face and they would talk about that and again they'd name a lot of those little towns that surrounded there which I have forgotten, Dangerfield [Texas] comes to mind but they would talk about Almerhall (ph.) [Texas], little towns that were near there and they talked about my [maternal] grandmother [Lucy Miller Ivory] making dresses out of the croker sacks, that's just an old tradition.  It was a big flour--big sack made out of cloth and you kept flour in it and it had cute little floral designs on it and the tradition was the blacks would take these croker-they called them crocker sacks but they were flour sacks.  Why they called them croker sacks, I have no idea but they made dresses out of them and they would talk about--nobody was embarrassed by it because every--almost all the girl kids had on croker sack dresses and it was wonderful cloth for making clothes and they talked about that.  They talked about killing the hogs and they talked about using the rub boards to wash with and making soap and whatever you call it, a churn.  I think they used to call it a churn and canning, they talked a lot about canning vegetables, shelling peas and putting them up for the winter.  They talked a lot about that and even when they came to Dallas [Texas], we all-see I grew up with my parents in my grandmother and [maternal] grandfather's [Sim Ivory] house in south Dallas which is still there, it's vacant but the house is still there.  I own the little piece of property but it's vacant.  But at any rate my grandparents' house was the center of attention.  When any relatives would come to Dallas, they would come there and they would--I remember growing up in that house and my grandmother and my aunt [Alice Ivory], we called her Aunt Sister because they were called sister.  So we called Aunt Sister so my grandmother, we called mama and my Aunt Sister.  I remember them canning because they brought the canning tradition to Dallas and with my growing up memory that was just a common thing they would do canning.  I've shelled a few peas myself and helped prepare the vegetables.  I remember sitting on the side porch because my grandfather-it was a shotgun house but my grandfather took it and expanded it.  Built a side porch and built some additional bedrooms in the back and we all--it's amazing how so many folk would be in that house but I think about it now and I wonder how did we do that because again, it was just an original shotgun house that he had extended and expanded.  All these relatives and we would sleep on the floor on what we would call a pallet, sleep on the floor and everybody was just fine.  How did we do that, how did we manage that but we did.  But anyway all of that canning and stuff and relatives always coming through, somebody was always in town and coming through and Lucy and Sim were like the centerpiece for the family.
Speaker 2: Okay now did your mother [Nettie Ivory Adams]-when she grew up down in Naples [Texas] was there a school there?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't remember them talking much about school but apparently I mean obviously there was some little school there for African Americans and they went there.  So-but I have no memories of them talking about the school.
Speaker 2: Okay, so did your mother--was she able to finish school?
Speaker 1: She came to Dallas and enrolled in high school in Dallas. That's where she met my dad [Frank McLeod Adams] and the school was Lincoln High School where I went and they were there in '39, 1939.  They were in the graduating class of '39 [1939].  So she graduated high school here in Dallas so obviously she came to Dallas as a teenager.  She probably was--I don't know what year they came here but obviously she must have been like maybe twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen [years old], something like that.  She was the child number five and then the youngest child was a brother under her, maybe about two or three years younger than her.  So they always call her the baby girl.  And she--they told stories about how she was spoiled because she was like a favorite and the brothers all liked her because she was the little sister.  They told a lot of stories about that and my dad--I mean my mom was a pretty--she was an attractive woman and so she got a lot of attention.
Story_ID: 42148
Speaker 1: Now when your mother [Nettie Ivory Adams] was at Lincoln [Lincoln High School, Dallas, Texas], what was her aspiration, just to graduate or did she see herself doing something special in the future?
Speaker 2: What an interesting question.  I wish I had asked her.  That's an interesting question.  My mother was very talented, she could speak, she was so great with people, she was the life of the party.  My dad [Frank McLeod Adams] was totally opposite, very quiet but my mom, she'd walk into a room and she instantly takes over the room and she never stops talking after that.  She walks in and she's just talking and from one subject to the other.  So just charismatic, you know so--but I never heard her talk about aspirations.  Of course, I have all these memories of her coming home.  She would ride the bus home; she worked in a white beauty shop.  She was what was called then a shampoo girl and she did study--I remember her when she studied beautician stuff, beauty operator.  I remember her going to beauty school and she would practice on my sister and me.  I remember this little thing would give you--it was like a little glass hand and she would give us the little shoulder massages practicing on my sister and I and she would come home and practice.  I remember her studying to be this beautician which was a big, huge trend for African American women of that era, you go to beauty school.  That's still a very easy occupation now but she was in that, and so I remember her in--she got this job as a shampoo girl in a white shop in rich, North Dallas [Texas] and she would ride the bus home and I would remember her coming up the street.  The bus would stop up at the end of the street and she'd walk to our house which was my grandmother's--my [maternal] grandparents' [Sim Ivory and Lucy Miller Ivory] house.  There were frustrating things that was part of the conversation between my mom and my aunt [Alice Ivory] on the porch was what happened at the shop that day and who had insulted her and she knew to keep her place.  But even so, it was still kind of a prestige thing, I would think for a black woman to have this job in a North Dallas beauty shop even though she had to keep her place as the shampoo girl.  But there were all these stories about what happened that day and how she handled whatever frustrating situation.
Speaker 1: Did she have stories about the society?
Speaker 2: Ms. Daisy or somebody?
Speaker 1: Society people, the wives of the famous here in Dallas.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah. Absolutely. Well, not so much famous but just the folk who had money, the money women who would come in to get all of the beauty things done.  So there just story after story about that because again North Dallas was where all the well off whites lived and they would come to this shop and I could almost call the name of the shop.  I think it was called Glick's, one of them because I think she worked at a couple of them and I remember--that name just came to me just then, Glick's Beauty Shop and whatever that was at the time but, you know, there was all this talk of that.  So she had two primary jobs at this one shop and then she got another pretty much in the same area.  But those were the porch stories--part of the porch stories.
Story_ID: 42149
Speaker 1: Right, right. Would she do the voices and stuff of the people that--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well you know I think they probably did.  Now my aunt--my mother [Nettie Ivory Adams] was--again she was a very charismatic person and she had a lot of humor but my aunt [Alice Ivory] was very straight forward, sort of had a little anger edge to her which was the same dynamic of my [maternal] grandmother [Lucy Miller Ivory] and her sister.  My mother's mother, Lucy had a sister named Zettie, kind of sound like Nettie, and they would do porch sitting too but they would sit on the side porch and my grandmother, Lucy was literally like--I don't know how to describe it but she took second fiddle to my Aunt Zettie.  My Aunt Zettie was very hard and authoritative and my mother's sister, Alice took that dynamic.  They had the same dynamic is what I'm saying and I'm just thinking of this now how that side porch sitting thing with my grandmother and her sister was real similar to the front porch sitting thing of my mother and her sister and that hard, straight forward, no nonsense with my aunt and then my mom kind of taking second fiddle.  Same thing with my grandmother and her sister even though I think my grandmother was older than Zettie but anyway that dynamic.
Story_ID: 42150
Speaker 1: Okay. Let me talk about your father's side of the family.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father was Frank, F-R-A-N-K McLeod, M-C-L-E-O-D Adams, A-D-A-M-S.
Speaker 1: And what was his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth was March 14, 1921 in Fort Worth [Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay, that's right outside of Dallas [Texas], right?
Speaker 2: Correct about, what, twenty nine miles away I think?
Speaker 1: Now can you tell us about his side of the family, how far back can you trace them and what were the stories on that side?
Speaker 2: Okay, his mother was Eva, E-V-A Adams.  I know her maiden name but I just forgot it.  Eva Adams and his dad was James Dock, nickname Dock, D-O-C-K Adams, A-D-A-M-S and I know less about them, that's as far back as I can go with them.  So there is not that much information that I have on that side.
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how they came to Fort Worth or were they always--(simultaneous) (unclear)--as far as they know, or what?
Speaker 2: Not really, my dad didn't talk family a lot and my dad was raised by an elderly aunt in Dallas and the story--the family story is that his mother, Eva married James when she was extremely young.  I'm told that she was eleven now that's the family story that they married when she was eleven and that she had the children--there were three boys and one girl and they said--the family story is that she would still play with dolls when she started having children, that was the family story.  Pretty much still a rural type living.  I remember my dad and his brothers, he was kind of close to his brothers even though when Eva had Frank who was the youngest child, he somehow was sent to Dallas to live with this elderly aunt, Aunt Lyie (ph.)--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: Gosh, I don't know how you spell Lyie.  I always just spell it--I used to have a spelling for it but I don't remember--but Lyie I would spell phonetically.
Speaker 1: Blyie?
Speaker 2: No Lyie, Aunt Lyie that was her name, that's all I knew was Aunt Lyie but she was a Pentecostal, very religious person and the stories are when she would get what they called the holy ghosts even in elderly age she would jump over chairs at church because they would call it being--getting the holy ghosts.  But it would take over your body and there were lots of family stories about her doing all these chair jumping things because she lived to be very old but yet when she would get the holy ghosts, she would do all this incredible physical stuff.  But those were stories that they would tell about her.  But he was--I get the dynamic that he kind of felt put out because his mother, Eva had kept the other children with them but for some reason he felt separated because he was sent to Dallas to live and be raised by this elderly aunt by himself and that may be how he became such a--he was kind of loner but there are all kind of stories I could tell about my dad becoming a baseball person and the boys--black boys in the community loved him, loved him and he was like a--he was the father--he was a little person.  I'm about--my dad was just a little taller than me but he had this presence about him and he drew this younger generation to him and he was like the sage very quiet, level spoken but it was like when E.F. Hutton speaks, the world listens [reference to a 1970s and 1980s advertising campaign for E.F. Hutton & Co., an American stock brokerage firm].  When he would speak, these young generational boys who he coached, he was a baseball coach and he did little league and all like that and he was like the sage and when he died, all of these people, young men who were men now came to his funeral and told all these stories about how he had influenced his life and all like that so anyway that was my dad.
Speaker 1: 'Cause it's just--you have a sister, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's just the two of us.
Speaker 1: The two of you so your father was--you said he was a baseball guru to black males around?
Speaker 2: Exactly, and I remember growing up, going to all these--my mom and sister and I would go to these little baseball diamonds in my growing up years and watch him coach all these little leagues and all like that.  So that's a lot of memory.
Story_ID: 42151
Speaker 1: Now there was a story when I read about him he had a trial with the Negro Leagues?
Speaker 2: Yes, when he was in high school at Lincoln [Lincoln High School, Dallas, Texas] in 1939, he was like this little--they called him Scat Back because he was on the football team and Bill Blair, I think he interviewed Bill Blair who did make it to the Negro League.  But he and my dad [Frank McLeod Adams] were very close friends and Bill Blair always tells stories about Scat Back who was my dad and he was--I guess because he was small.  He was extremely fast and so he was great on the football team for running.  I don't know what position he played but obviously it was some kind of running position.  But baseball was his love.  I never heard high school baseball stories but I heard the high school football stories.  So the baseball dynamic came, I guess, after high school because the thing was that all the little black boys wanted to be in the Negro League.  Bill Blair made it and my dad did try out and the story that I'm told is that I think he got accepted but for some reason he came back to be with my mom [Nettie Ivory Adams] and he always had that sort of quality of regret.  He never voiced it but somehow it just came through as he would talk about his memories of the Negro League.  How he had this opportunity to be in the Negro League but for some reason he came back and I don't know if he came back to marry my mom or what but somehow he came back and became a family man.
Speaker 1: Now that's probably the reason, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Right, and so--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Because you have to be on the road, you can't be at home when you're playing, because those teams were barn storming teams.
Speaker 2: That's exactly right and he and Bill Blair would--when they would get together they did a lot of baseball talk and Negro League talk and all of that.
Story_ID: 42152
Speaker 1: So--but getting back to my dad's [Frank McLeod] family so the two brothers and the sister grew up in the Fort Worth [Texas] area with James [Adams] and Eva [Adams] who were the parents and my dad Frank, grew up in Dallas [Texas] with Aunt Lyie who was this Pentecostal type, religious person and I remember my dad saying he would sit on her porch a lot and just kind of watch life go by.  My dad was very intelligent and he became some of the early--he was in that early crop of black men who got hired by the post office [United States Postal Service].  So he was one of the early black male carriers in Dallas [Texas].
Story_ID: 42153
Speaker 1: Now did your dad [Frank McLeod Adams] serve in the Army?
Speaker 2: Yes, in the army, yeah he was in the Army
Speaker 1: Did he go overseas? (Simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Philippines (simultaneous), New Guinea, he was in New Guinea.
Speaker 1: So he was drafted along with so many people at that time.
Speaker 2: Right, and he spent military time in California and my mom went to California and spent some time there with him.  This was all in the '40s [1940s] so it would have been what, World War II [1939-1945] or whatever and my mom [Nettie Ivory Adams] got a job there working on airplanes, putting parts together because there is a picture in the family album of her on the wing of an airplane.  And again, my mom was real cute so as she's all posing and everything but anyway she got a military job in an assembly line or whatever and she spent time there on the west coast with my dad and then she came back to Dallas [Texas].  When I was born, my dad was in New Guinea and there are all these family stories about he was really regretful that he wasn't there for the birth of his child.  My sister [Doris Adams Serrell] has a different father and we never knew him, my mother knew him but we never knew him.  But, at any rate, there are all these stories about he sent gifts home for me and in fact, somewhere in my pack rat stuff I still have a comb that he sent from the Philippines or New Guinea or wherever he was; a comb for--a baby comb and some other baby stuff.  He was in--on a military assignment when I was born.  So I was born in the '40s [1940s], you can do the math (laugh).
Speaker 1: Alright, I'm not going to say anything but during the war.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 42154
Speaker 1: Now your dad [Frank McLeod Adams] came back and then, I guess, as a GI he was able to get on the post office. That probably helped--
Speaker 2: Well probably but I think he got with the--I think it was the early '50s [1950s] when he got with the post office but he was in that first crop.
Speaker 1: It probably helps though because if you're a GI you get--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, no doubt about it.
Speaker 1: Now did he go to school on the GI bill?
Speaker 2: He did, in fact I kind of remember him--I either remember it or hearing a lot of stories about it but he took--I think it was like night classes.  I don't know what he was studying but I do remember that he--see my mom [Nettie Ivory Adams] did not go to, you know, anything beyond high school except for skill training which was the beauty school.  But my dad did do classes and I think it was called The Wiley Extension, Wiley College Extension and it was somewhere in the downtown area, downtown Dallas [Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is Wiley College that was made famous in the movie 'The Great Debaters.'
Speaker 2: Correct
Speaker 1: But this is the college extension--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: And I wish I knew what he studied but I don't.  Probably just basic education stuff but he did have the high school diploma and some study time at Wiley and then the post office.
Speaker 1: Post office?
Speaker 2: He was at the post office for thirty--when he retired he had been there thirty three years.
Speaker 1: Now this is not to be taken lightly because the post office had a lot of competition getting into the post office.
Speaker 2: My dad was--he was pretty sharp.  My dad was a sharp young man.
Speaker 1: Now do you remember the day, before a lot of other occupations were open to blacks and so-- simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Absolutely, it was a big thing for black men to get hired at the post office, in fact, my dad and my sister's father in law were in--both of them were in that early crop and they--we had family Christmas gatherings for many, many years and they would tell stories about they had routes in the white area of town and they would tell stories about a couple of people coming out and saying look, here's come one.  Meaning a black postal carrier and they would tell those stories about how there would sometimes be negative reaction to this mail carrier coming up on your porch and then there were the other stories of them being welcomed.  And I remember growing up at Christmas time my mom [Nettie Ivory Adams] and my sister [Doris Adams Serrell] and I would have a wonderful time at Christmas because my dad would come home with all these gifts, Christmas gifts beautifully wrapped.  Very nice Christmas gifts and we would gather around the Christmas tree before Christmas.  Some days before Christmas and just have this ceremony of opening all these gifts that my dad's mail people had given him.  And I mean I'm talking a lot of beautifully wrapped gifts, nice stuff and that was just a fun time.  That went on for a long time.
Speaker 1: Okay so the mix bag.
Story_ID: 42155
Speaker 1: Now when you consider your parents' personalities, their dispositions and the way they walked, the way they talked, the way they looked, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I'm a mixture, I absolutely am a mixture.  I talk more now but I can remember being a quiet person.  In high school I was considered kind of quiet, which is absolutely my dad [Frank McLeod Adams].  But now my dad could tell stories and when he got the opportunity to get a word in because like I said when my mom [Nettie Ivory Adams] entered the room, she took over but I really am more my dad.  My looks are my dad, I don't--to me I don't look like my mom.  She was a much lighter--her complexion was your complexion but I am my dad and I am my [paternal] grandmother [Eva Adams].  To me my grandmother looked like what's called a black Indian, in fact, I think those were the stories that she had some kind of black Indian in her.
Speaker 1: This is your father's--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: My father's mother and she had the shoulder length--what we call wavy hair and--but her features were absolutely mine and my skin tone--dark skin tone is my dad and my grandmother--my paternal grandmother, Eva.  But we were talking about the different personalities.  So my dad was more the quiet, contemplative, sage person when he spoke.  He waited on an opportunity to speak but when he spoke it had quality, I mean it absolutely did and my mom was very gregarious, talkative, very humorous.  They could both tell stories but my dad, like I said, when he could get a word in he could tell stories (laugh) but my mom was just constant, you know, and so my personality is more my dad.  But now that I'm becoming my mother because you know we do become our parents.  I have become my mother and even like in my church, I'm a big church person but my mom was a huge youth leader in our church and I have all kinds of memories of the stuff we did as young people, our church youth group and all these things my mother would coordinate and organize with the young people.  And when she would speak at church, she could just--everybody--she was really fun to listen to and I have become that now and when I was growing up, I would just sit and listen, you know, but I talk a lot when I feel like it.  But that's absolutely my mother so I'm a mixture.
Speaker 1: Okay
Speaker 2: Now my legs are absolutely my mother's and when I was in high school, everybody talked about I had my mother's legs again my mom was a cute woman.
Speaker 1: So these are cute legs?
Speaker 2: And that's what I was told (laugh) and so I'm a mixture.
Story_ID: 42156
Speaker 1: Now you have one sister [Doris Adams Serrell], right?
Speaker 2: Correct she's four years older and she was a music teacher.  She got a degree in music from what was then North Texas State University, it's now the University of North Texas in Denton [Texas] and whereas I went to UT [University of Texas] in Austin, there's a story about me going to UT Austin but my sister received a music degree from North Texas State University in Denton.
Speaker 1: Now did she specialize in any one instrument?
Speaker 2: Piano, we both grew up with piano.  I played piano, we both grew up playing piano and both sing, we both sing.  My mother [Nettie Ivory Adams] strangely enough and certainly not my dad [Frank McLeod Adams], neither one of them sing but my sister and I sing.  I mean we do a lot of singing and grew up doing that; we can't figure that out, where that came from.
Speaker 1: So she's a teacher, she's a music teacher?
Speaker 2: Correct, she's retired but she taught in Garland [Texas], they live in Garland.
Speaker 1: What's your sister's name?
Speaker 2: Doris Serrell, S-E-R-R-E-L-L, that's her married name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Her husband is Gene, G-E-N-E, Gene Serrell and his dad is the one that also was with the--well actually it's his stepdad was also with the post office with my father and he's still around by the way.
Story_ID: 42157
Speaker 1: So now when you were growing up the household consisted of your mother [Nettie Ivory Adams] and father [Frank McLeod Adams], you and your sister [Doris Adams Serrell].
Speaker 2: In my [maternal] grandparents' house so there was Sim [Ivory] and Lucy [Miller Ivory]--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: You grew up in your grandparents' house?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was Sim and Lucy, Nettie and Frank, Doris and Norma in my grandmother's house and then all the relatives would come through and my Aunt Sister [Alice Ivory] who was Alice when they also lived in Naples [Texas] but when they would come--they came to Dallas [Texas] for the summer all the time.  Every summer they would come and spend the summer in my grandparents' house and there was a lot of porch sitting and stuff going on then and all the children--we slept on pallets on the floor during the summer.
Speaker 1: Okay so this is a full house?
Speaker 2: Full, yeah, Grand Central Station was my grandparents' house which is still there vacant was Grand Central Station for the family.
Speaker 1: And then your dad is mentoring all these young men too.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Baseball teams full of them.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: So a lot of traffic.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Story_ID: 42158
Speaker 1: Alright do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yeah, breaking my bottled doll on my [maternal] grandparents' [Sim Ivory and Lucy Miller Ivory] porch.  I'm obviously a toddler.  The bottled doll was a toy and I took the--way back in history I took a Dale Carnegie course and you had to tell a story and I told the story of bottled dolls but it was a tradition--an African American tradition.  You would take a soda pop bottle, you would get a rope, unravel the rope, put the rope in the top of the soda bottle, put that cap back on.  You know those old glass soda pop bottles that had these caps so you could put--unravel the rope and put it in there and put the cap back on and secure it.  So obviously somebody made this doll for me but it was tons of fun because you would comb this rope hair and this would be your little bottled doll.  And so my memory is being on my grandmother's porch and I broke the thing and it put a huge gash in my ankle and it devastated my dad [Frank McLeod Adams] and he never--I was never allowed to because obviously it was dangerous, a toddler playing with glass and I was never allowed to play with a bottled doll again.  That gash was in my ankle forever, it might still be there but that's my earliest memory of yapping when this thing broke and my dad running and taking care of me, that's my earliest memory.
Story_ID: 42159
Speaker 1: Did you grow up in the same house the whole time?
Speaker 2: Well, in '57 [1957] one block up, my dad [Frank McLeod Adams] was--before he got on with the post office [United States Postal Service] and I forgot this, he was a carpenter and so there was a black contractor in the community who was very skilled at carpentry and so my dad got on with him.  And so this person, his name was Stanley Jackson, Sr. he built this house one block up from my grandmother's house and, of course, I guess he told my dad about it and we ended--my dad and my mom [Nettie Ivory Adams] ended up buying it as their first home.  So I still own that property now and it has a family in it but I remember this ceremony of us finally moving from my [maternal] grandparents' [Sim Ivory and Lucy Miller Ivory] house and moving up this little side street right there where you can sit on my grandmother's porch and see my mom and dad's new house and so that's where we moved in '57 [1957] and then I grew up there.  And every day, as many times as I felt like it, I would leave our house and walk down to mama and papa's house and there was just this little trail.  I mean, literally there was this little side street and you could--you could stand on my grandmother's porch and see our back door or from our back door see my grandmother's house.  There was just--whenever you felt like it, you know this trail.
Speaker 1: Okay so this is basically the same neighborhood, same environment so when you moved in--your parents moved into the new place, was it just you and your sister and your mother and father?
Speaker 2: Yes, mom and dad, my sister [Doris Adams Serrell] and I, right.  No pets.
Speaker 1: You were about eleven or twelve [years old]?
Speaker 2: I must have been about eleven [years old], must have been approximately, you can do the math (laugh).  But I think that's probably right.
Story_ID: 42160
Speaker 1: So we always ask this question, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Wow, well the smells, of course, would be the canning.  I forgot the preserves, the peach preserves.  There was a lot of peeling peaches and peeling pears and then they would sugar them, you know make--marinate them in the sugar.  And so I remember--that would be the smell, the canning smell of the preserves.  Red beans and corn bread, I promise you we must have eaten red beans and corn bread every day, then of course, the tradition was chicken on Sundays but that's all I remember for some reason red beans and corn bread.  That's how I became such a big corn bread eater.
Speaker 1: So during the week you didn't--the family would have red beans and corn bread most of the time.
Speaker 2: That's what I remember.  Now my dad [Frank McLeod Adams] would rabbit hunt, this is when we still lived with mama and papa [maternal grandparents Lucy Miller Ivory and Sim Ivory].  He would go rabbit hunting--huntin', rabbit huntin'--and then we would have rabbit.  So that's kind of--the food would be the smell and the sights were just people walking up and down the street because I was a very--it was very much an enclave and my sister [Doris Adams Serrell] and I grew up in a very protected environment.  The neighborhood was it, we never travelled but the neighborhood, South Dallas [Texas] right in that little enclave, was our world.  That's why the story about my dad with the dot was so significant because our world was the neighborhood and he was trying to get us to think beyond that.  But at any rate, the sights would be the people who would walk up and down that street and, of course, church.  Church was--you just might as well call church a part of the family because church going was intrinsic and that was you know--you'd spend time at home in the neighborhood during the week and then on Sundays you would be at church.  And so those were the sights, sounds, the sounds--oh my goodness, you just made me remember (laugh).  In my very early youth, again this is old South Dallas, black community.  I guess you could use the word ghetto but black community.  I remember the very early--this is one of those Semitic sounds was this guy coming up the street selling brooms.  Broom man, broom man, broom man and that sound was this man--the ice man would come up, he must have been--I don't know whether he was in a car, it must have been a truck, it must have been an old truck.  But a guy would come up the street selling ice because everybody had an ice box.  My grandfather had a--what was called a smoke house in their backyard.  He smoked meat and so this guy would come up the street selling ice, this guy would walk up the street selling brooms.  Now, I guess that was his craft was making brooms.  That sound (laugh) is a sound that I remember and so those are the memories.
Speaker 1: Okay, that is something in those days you had--we had the watermelon man.
Speaker 2: I don't really remember so much the watermelon man but he must have come because we did a lot of watermelon eating.  So obviously we bought it from the watermelon man but the iceman and the broom man--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Did your family use the homemade brooms that the broom man made?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right so go figure.
Speaker 1: Okay, were they--I mean people are--simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: I don't have a visual, I don't have a visual of the brooms, I just have the sound of him coming up the street selling them but I don't have a visual of what they looked like.  The 'Wizard of Oz' witch with the broom, you know the image of the witch on a broom, I guess it must have looked like that.
Speaker 1: Was it that kind of broom?
Speaker 2: I'm saying it must have been because I don't have a visual of what the broom looked like.
Story_ID: 42161
Speaker 1: I take it you went to your mother's [Nettie Ivory Adams] church, right?
Speaker 2: Well all the family went and the name of the church--I'm still a member of that old--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: This is Mount--?
Speaker 2: Mount, M-T period, Horeb, H-O-R-E-B Baptist Church.  I was born in that church when I say born, when I was born my family, all the family--well it was the neighborhood church and it was kind of a big centerpiece of the community and everybody in the community went to Mt. Horeb and so I'm still a member.
Speaker 1: Now Mt. Horeb must be someplace in the Old Testament, I would guess?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I think--in fact I think that's where Moses, now don't start me to lying on the Bible but I think that's where Moses got the commandments but it was a mountain in the Bible where some figure went up and did something.  I'm going to say--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: I think it was around Mt. Sinai or Mt. (unclear) or somewhere--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: That's where the Arc was but--so yes I'm about to lie on Moses.  So don't let my pastor know that I'm telling lies but it's in the Bible.
Speaker 1: It is in the Bible. (simultaneous)(unclear)
Speaker 2: You're going to make me go back and research Mt. Horeb in the Bible.
Speaker 1: This is a missionary Baptist church, right?
Speaker 2: It's a missionary Baptist--now that was part of the name but in the early 2000s we dropped the missionary.  So it was Mt. Horeb Missionary Baptist but now it's Mt. Horeb Baptist Church.  Don't ask me why, I don't know.  But I remember that the change came in the--around 2000 for some legal reason.
Speaker 1: Okay so I figured it was your mother's church because your father [Frank McLeod Adams] was raised in the sanctified church where you go to church a lot.
Speaker 2: Right, but when they married, he joined my mother's church so everybody, grandparents [Sim Ivory and Lucy Miller Ivory], cousins, my parents, the whole neighborhood went to my Mt. Horeb.
Speaker 1: Okay so did--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: But he grew up--yes he did grow up in the sanctified church but then when he married, he joined Mt. Horeb.
Speaker 1: So there are a lot of relatives in your neighborhood.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, right.
Speaker 1: People associate with the same church; I mean it's like a village.
Speaker 2: It was absolutely a village and that's why I say we were--my sister [Doris Adams Serrell] and I were insulated and we would ride the bus downtown and then we would ride with my dad in his Ford, my dad loved old Ford cars.  He had a string of Ford cars, we would ride in the car with my dad to pick up my mom from work on the days that she didn't ride the bus home and then he would take us riding at Christmas time to see the lights in the white part of town which is where he delivered mail and my mom's beauty shop was.  We would get in the car, my sister and I and if there were a couple of cousins available, they would go with us but he would take us on this tour of watching the lights at Christmas.  That was a big thing.
Speaker 1: You're right, I remember similar--that was the era.  People would say, let's go for a ride.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in his Ford car.  All of his cars were Fords.
Story_ID: 42162
Speaker 1: School, now where did you start school?
Speaker 2: Right down the street from my [maternal] grandmother's [Lucy Miller Ivory] house, H.S. Thompson, T-H-O-M-P-S-O-N Elementary School.  It was at the corner of the street.
Speaker 1: Now was H.S. Thompson a black educator?
Speaker 2: It was named for a black man, yes.  He was a principal at some time, yeah.
Speaker 1: This is the elementary school.  I take it you liked school, I just get that impression?
Speaker 2: Oh gosh yes, oh please help me (laugh).  That was my world and books were my--you know I told you we didn't travel, but I travelled everywhere.  I flew in space ships, I went back in time in King Arthur's court, I travelled everywhere but I never left South Dallas [Texas].  That was my world, those characters, I lived on islands, Treasure Island, I lived on islands, I just went all over the world in those books--my dad's dot.
Speaker 1: Alright, now this is why--you see the commercials in the library, Reading Rainbow they talk about you can go anywhere in a book.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, that's what I did.  I skated on the sidewalks of New York; loved skating on the sidewalks of New York [New York City, New York], yeah.
Speaker 1: You're the kind of child they made the library for.
Speaker 2: Hey, in fact, that was my introduction to journalism was the library at that elementary school with Ms. Johnson, Merline (ph.) Johnson who was the librarian and she introduced me to the book and I saw Treasure Island and that was the first book that I remember was Treasure Island.
Speaker 1: Merline Johnson, okay the librarian.
Speaker 2: And she also went to Mt. Horeb [Mt. Horeb Baptist Church], by the way.
Speaker 1: So Treasure Island okay--.
Speaker 2: My guy Friday, I think was the guy on the island.  A lot of it is kind of beginning to fade.
Speaker 1: That's Robinson Crusoe.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, it was Robinson Crusoe, it was Robinson Crusoe but Treasure Island that was another one but it was absolutely Robinson Crusoe, you're right.  Like I said, a lot of stuff is beginning to fade.
Speaker 1: Okay now were you a good student in school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was among the top ten all the way through school.  You know, A's and B's so a very good student, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you get the chance to pass out the papers and all that (laugh)?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I mean I was absolutely the ideal student.  I was not a trouble maker, I was--I followed all the rules, in fact, I remember being in elementary school and this kind of was sort of a life's lesson for me, I remember this one incident in elementary school--I say elementary but again memory is beginning to fade.  I don't think it was high school but it was--had to be elementary school and myself and a few other students were in the hall but we didn't have a pass and I remember this teacher coming and confronting us, why are you all in this hall and you don't have a pass?  I remember specifically considering telling a lie or telling the truth and I chose the truth.  And this teacher let us go and that spoke to me.  Don't break the rules; follow the rules and you'll be okay and that kind of set my tone for life.  I was a rule follower so I followed the rules, I did my homework, loved it and I kind of was--I remember having leader qualities early on.  Because I remember that people kind of listened to me for some reason.  Even though I was quiet, I kind of remember that I did have some influence on other kids but I didn't realize that's what I was doing at the time.  As I look back on it now, that's kind of the way it comes across.  That hall incident, I guess, because I spoke up, the other kids kind of froze and I spoke up and decided to tell the truth, I don't know why we were in the hall without a pass but I told the truth and it got us out of trouble and that spoke to me.
Story_ID: 42163
Speaker 1: Okay did you have any favorite teachers in elementary school?
Speaker 2: Well, Ms. Johnson, the librarian and this other teacher--I wouldn't call her a favorite but she absolutely is frozen in my memory, now this was high school [Lincoln High School, Dallas, Texas], Ms. Mayo, Gladys Mayo.  Tough taskmaster but she was an extremely good English teacher and she had us to write some essays and poems and I remember this one incident where I wrote a poem and when I read it--stood before the class and read it and she challenged me, you didn't write that, you didn't write that.  It broke my heart because I wrote it and I kept that poem for a long time and it got lost somehow.  I wish I had that poem but it was called 'That Book on the Shelf.'  I remember that was the 'That Book on the Shelf' is to read not fed with dust, that was the beginning of it and I wrote it and read it and she said, you didn't write that.  I stood there and just fell apart.  I couldn't stop crying because I absolutely wrote it and she didn't believe it and I remember I went back to my seat, I couldn't stop crying and finally she said, go to the restroom and wash your face and this other girl went with me, Shirley Showers.  She comforted me, she said, "That's alright Norma, we know you wrote it," and so when I became a reporter somewhere I ran into Ms. Mayo and I almost wanted to--I didn't but I could tell that she must have remembered that incident because I was now a reporter.  She did learn later that I did have this writing quality but I remember after I became a reporter and I ran across her and I wanted to say, see I did write that but I didn't say that.  But--I forgot what lead me to that story but--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: That's the kind of story though in grade school that people--I have--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: You have something similar?
Speaker 1: Yes, very similar and it really hurts when people don't believe you did what you actually did.
Speaker 2: I could not stop crying and I sat there at that desk and I tried and tried and the tears just wouldn't stop and finally she told me to go to the restroom and this other girl went with me.
Speaker 1: So how old were you then?
Speaker 2: Well that was high school; that was high school so I must have been--it was either eighth or ninth grade.  I'm going to say because we went to the high school at eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay
Story_ID: 42164
Speaker 1: So this is growing up in Dallas, Texas?  These were the days when television, radio, movies filled with images of the wild west.  Everybody--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well I remember the TV shows, Howdy Doody, Wild Bill Hickok, The Lone Ranger I remember the TV shows.  Art Linkletter, Arthur Godfrey, I remember those--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: So you all had a TV?
Speaker 2: Well, it must have been the '50s [1950s] and I remember the family sitting around watching the TV, black and white TV shows.  I don't think we were in the first crop of families that had it but we acquired it somewhere along the way.  But we'd gather around and watch it.
Story_ID: 42165
Speaker 1: Well, my story of becoming a reporter was back to Ms. Merline Johnson in the library and reading.  Reading became my world and other kids would go to the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association] and YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] and places like that.  I never did, my bedroom, again was my entertainment and I remember going to the library and I'd come home with stacks of books.  I remember--I don't know why I came--became a memory but one summer I checked out thirty three books and it was absolutely thirty three books and I came home with a stack of thirty three books and I just stayed in my bedroom and read those books.  Had a wonderful time but that was my entertainment and so words and reading I had a link with that--I had a connection with that and then the story is that when I was at Lincoln High School [Dallas, Texas], we had a speakers day program and I remember sitting in the auditorium and Julia Scott Reed was a reporter with the Black Press and she came and spoke.  She was speaking to me.  I'm sitting in an audience full of folk but she was talking to me and she was talking about her life and that was my first thought, hey I could do something like that, I could write like she does.  And later in life when I came to the Morning News, she was the first black that was hired in the newsroom in 1967.  She was a big reporter with the Black Press for all those years and then in '67 [1967] when there was this push to bring blacks into the newsroom they went and brought her in and there was a big, huge community story about her accepting the job and how she agonized over whether to do it or not and then she finally did and she was a columnist.  She wrote strictly about the African American community and then when I--that was 1967 and then I came in '74 [1974] and I was the first black hired to--that reported news city wide.  She was self taught in the black press even though she went to Phillips Business School [Texas] but she taught herself reporting skills.  She did photography and the whole nine.  She was a gutsy woman.  So anyway, she was my image.  Little did I know in Lincoln High School early years, I must have been a freshman that she would become my mentor years later and I remember when I came to the Morning News and there she sat, I remembered remembering her when I was in elementary school.  So that was my first thought that I could do that when she came and spoke.
Speaker 2: Did you necessarily want to be a news reporter or a writer?
Speaker 1: A writer like she was.  She was a black woman who wrote, used words and told stories and so the thought came to me that I could do that.
Story_ID: 42166
Speaker 1: Now did you read any black literature when you were in school, grade school or high school?
Speaker 2: I did but it was more just the classic stuff that was on the reading list at the time.  Because I became familiar with the black writers but I don't remember being drawn to black writers.  It was more just writing and books.
Speaker 1: I just wondered if they taught the black writers.
Speaker 2: Not really, not really.
Speaker 1: In the old days they used to teach, at least Dunbar.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, in fact, Ms. Nona Bell was a teacher who had us to memorize poems and I memorized some Paul Laurence Dunbar poems and she had us to speak in dialect.  We would memorize them in dialect and she used to recite them in dialect and so, yeah they were taught.
Speaker 1: I wondered.  So in high school what high school activities were you involved in?  Were you the editor?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was the editor of the Lincoln Lantern and there is a photograph in the high school memory book of the staff and I'm in there.  It says--I remember reading Norma Adams, editor.  Now we didn't publish a lot in that--it was more of a classroom thing.  I think we may have published twice or something like that, twice a year or something like that.  But I was the editor.
Speaker 1: Okay, Lincoln Lantern, did you run for class officer or anything?
Speaker 2: Let me think.
Story_ID: 42167
Speaker 1: I ran for high school queen and there's a story about--I did place, I was the third runner up for Ms. Lincoln.
Speaker 2: What is the story?
Speaker 1: Here's the story.  My dad [Frank McLeod Adams] who was this athletic person, small physically but very much into athletics and when I was in grade school, one of his buddies was on the coaching staff at the elementary school at H.S. Thompson [Elementary School] and he saw that I could run fast and he wanted me to be on the track team and my dad said absolutely not.  He didn't want his daughters to do athletics for some reason.  He wanted us to be brain--mind people and so the coach really tried to convince him to let me go because I was fast just like my dad had been fast but he said no.  So I didn't and then this opportunity came up to be--to try out to be Ms. Lincoln and for some reason I wanted to do it and when I broached the subject to my dad, he said absolutely not because he thought of it as a beauty contest.  I guess he visualized us parading across the stage in swim suits or something (laugh).  But I said no, no daddy it's not that.  He said no and just--when my dad made a decision; that was it.  You just might as well throw in the towel.  So I remember specifically saying, well dad give me a little time, please don't say anything yet, give me time to convince you that it's more than a beauty contest.  So he took a big breath and he said, well go for it, let me see what you can tell me.  So I remember I stayed up late that night--we lived in a little--our house was a little two bedroom, frame house which I said is still there and a family is still in it.  But I remember staying up late and my dad would get up real early like at 4:00 a.m. to leave to go to work so before I went to bed, I wrote out this document.  It was a letter but I remember writing and I don't have it, I wish I had kept it but I posted it on his bedroom door so when he woke up early to leave, he would get it.  And I poured my heart into it to explain why it was more than a beauty contest.  What it did was it would show your talent.  There were segments, you would a talent part, you would do a speaking part, you would do a modeling part and I think there was another part, I don't remember what it was and then they would score you--how you ranked in all these different parts.  I don't know why--I don't even know why I wanted to do it but I wanted to do it and I really wanted to do it.  So anyway, I posted this thing on the door and he went to work.  So all day I was just very anxious about what his decision would be.  You know, off the top of the mountain, what would be the decision.  So he came home from work and he said, chief, he'd call me chief and chicken, chicken and chief.  And he said chief you got me; I'm going to let you do it.  Oh boy you don't know how big that was for my dad to have said no and then because I must have really put the writing together well and that taught me another lesson, that you could use the written word to change minds because that was monumental for my dad to say no and then to back up and reconsider and say yes.  I remember I ended up placing and I was third runner up and there's a photograph of me getting the prize as being third runner up.  But he was absolutely proud.  They came to the program and all like that and when it was over I remember how proud he was of me and he let me know.  He said that I didn't want you to do it but you were great and I was pretty good at it.  So anyway there were all kinds of lessons in that.
Story_ID: 42168
Speaker 1: Now you had a friend who had polio?
Speaker 2: Right, my friend Verna Brown Mitchell and she got polio when we were growing up.  Oh she must have been eight or nine or something and she spent time in an iron lung and what I recall about that and she's still a very close friend today her being such an over comer. First of all the fear of polio was just great.  I mean, I remember it sweeping through the community [Dallas, Texas] and I remember the stories of people dying and being paralyzed for life but she came through it and spent time in the iron lung and all like that and then she has this dynamic--it stunted her growth so she and I--she's a little shorter than I am, her sister is average height but it stunted her growth but she is physically okay.  She had some residual things left over throughout the rest of her life.  She had to have a kidney transplant and all like that but everything that happens to Verna, she'd overcome it and she became an educator.  She became a high school principal that little person, smaller--shorter than me but with this huge confidence, you know.  Her story, to me, is overcoming, no matter what life throws at you.  Being in an iron lung and she overcame that and it's just.  She travels all over everywhere and does everything and she's just such a confident, authoritative person.  We listen to Verna.  When us peers get together, she's this little thing but we all listen to her.  My lesson from Verna is how life can throw everything at you but you can overcome.

Speaker 1: Now when you were in high school here in Dallas [Texas] what--were your parents involved in the civil rights activity at all?
Speaker 2: No, they were not civil rights people.  My mom [Nettie Ivory Adams] was strictly a God person and so the solution to everything was God and Christ and we watched all the Martin Luther King [Jr.] television things and my dad [Frank McLeod Adams] was--I don't know how to describe his take on civil rights.  I remember him watching--my dad watched the news and read the Dallas Morning News all the time and my memory of the Dallas Morning News is growing up watching my dad reading it and when I looked at it, there was nothing in there about people that looked like me and nothing in it about my community.  And so when I got into journalism that was--the tradition was to go to the Hometown Daily which was the Dallas Morning News and I went and got refused a couple of times and there's a whole story about me finally getting hired and telling our story to the masses through the Daily Newspaper.  But the civil rights--I married the same month that Martin Luther King was assassinated.
Speaker 1: Right in '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: And I think he was--it was either the fourth or sixth, I'm forgetting now which one, he was assassinated and then I married on April 6th.  And so I remember my dad being in the living room at our house there and the news and I said something like well he's at peace now or some coined phrase.  My dad got very angry and he said he should not be dead, there's no reason why he should be dead.  Don't diminish how he died, those were not his words but that was his message, by some little pat answer he's at peace now.  He was very angry and I wasn't trying to be flip, I guess I was trying to be comforting but he was upset by it and so I just have that memory of how he took the death of--the assassination of Martin Luther King.  I know that I was all caught up in preparing to get married two days later and I guess I didn't take in the real depth of it because so much else was going on.  But my dad took it very hard.

Speaker 1: The story of civil rights in Dallas [Texas] is that Dallas was always ten steps behind the rest of the nation.  There were all these demonstrations in other urban areas but not in Dallas.  Decisions concerning race relations in Dallas were made in smoked filled back rooms.  The North Dallas power brokers would connect with Dallas leaders and there would be a meeting somewhere and that would be how to deal with race issues in Dallas.  I can  remember interviewing many people from that era and when we got the first African American on the Dallas City Council, C.A. Galloway [Cleophas Anthony Galloway was appointed to the Dallas City Council in 1967 by Mayor J. Erik Johnsson]--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Did that happen while you were in school-in high school [Lincoln High School, Dallas, Texas]?
Speaker 1: I remember reporting about it but I probably was not aware of it at the time of growing up.  It would have happened in the '60s [1960s] so I would have been college age but did stories about it later.  But the way it happened was the North Dallas white power brokers decided what black person they wanted to put on the city council and that's what they did.  There was no election, they just picked this man.  He was an upstanding business man but they decided and they picked him and put him on the Dallas City Council and that's how we got the first African American on the Dallas City Council.
Speaker 2: So you got one but they still maintained control of the black community--simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Absolutely, right and that's how things were done in Dallas and so rather--now there was a group of radicals who tried--these were SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee], young black SNCC members and they tried to arouse the masses but they were crunched and sent to prison.
Speaker 2: Who were they?
Speaker 1: Ernest McMillan and Fred Bell were two of the names--Stoney Brooks was a white person--Stoney Burns.  So it was kind of a coming together of some young, cocky black young men and some liberal, white hippies.
Speaker 2: Were they ever--Did they ever--this would have been when you were in college or what?
Speaker 1: This was just as I was getting out of college and re-establishing myself in Dallas.
Speaker 2: So they were in prison for civil rights activities?
Speaker 1: Right, what they did was--the story on Ernest and I mean he was from a really well established black family, prominent black family but again very civically aware blacks.  They knew their rights and they knew the way things should be and that's the way they raised him.  So he was very aware, he went to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and all like that.  But got very caught up in the civil rights movement and became a SNCC member and came back to Dallas and was going to rise up the masses but Dallas blacks were not going to be risen up (laugh).  And so they did a demonstration at a neighborhood white owned store in a black community and they broke some produce like less than a hundred dollars and the police came down on them like nobody's business and they were prosecuted and sent to prison.
Speaker 2: Did they serve their full terms in prison?
Speaker 1: Not full terms but they served enough time to send the message back home, ya'll wanna do this but Ernie--and then he became a fugitive.  He left town and the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] tried to find him and finally did find him and brought him back.  There's a whole Ernie McMillan story.  He would be a great story, by the way.
Speaker 2: He's still here?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Ernest McMillan, Jr., I believe and his mom Eva McMillan was a civil rights icon in Dallas.  Eva McMillan was the mom and then her children and Ernie, Ernest McMillan, Jr.  So he would be a great story, he is a great story.  It really did steal his youth because like I said, he was a--he went to Morehouse and somehow came back to do civil rights stuff.
Story_ID: 42171
Speaker 1: I'm just trying to get a sense of what it was like--now you got the Dallas Morning News at home.  Did you get the black papers?
Speaker 2: The Dallas Post Tribune was the main one and the Dallas Weekly was the other main one that at one time we had eleven black publications at the height of the black press.  We had about eleven of them but those--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Really, eleven--?
Speaker 2: It got up to eleven; yeah we got up to eleven.
Speaker 1: At the same time?
Speaker 2: Well, I won't say at the same time but sort of a succession but I think at the same time we probably had four, maybe.
Speaker 1: A pretty sizeable black community in Dallas [Texas].  What's, I guess, in those days since we are doing this chronologically. In those days what would you have imagined the percentage of blacks would be in the city then?
Speaker 2: Again, memories fade.
Speaker 1: You think they would be at least a quarter of the city or--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, easily.  I can't--I'm afraid to try to quote it because that doesn't--like I said that's kind of one of the memories that has faded.
Story_ID: 42172
Speaker 1: As a senior in high school, you were a senior in high school when--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Right during the civil rights.
Speaker 1: Your sister had already gone to college, right?  To North Texas [University of North Texas, Denton, Texas] and so--who advised you about college, did you have a counselor at school?
Speaker 2: Yes, when I was so caught up with the written word and the power of the written word and was the editor for the school newspaper and this big reading buff and so I knew I wanted to do something with words and yes the high school counselor did talk to me about journalism.  Somehow the University of Texas at Austin was mentioned and I thought well that would be good but my dad, again, wanted me to go to school where my sister had already blazed the trail and he was already comfortable with North Texas.  He really wanted me to go there and I was a big music person.  Also I sang and played piano, spent a lot of years playing piano.
Speaker 1: So was North Texas--it wasn't predominantly black was it?
Speaker 2: Oh no, it was a state university and there was a whole integration story about that.  One of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] youth members helped integrate it and there is a lot of local stories about that.
Speaker 1: And I'm thinking that you're at the beginning--I mean when you were going to college, this is the beginning of the integration of the Texas schools, right?
Speaker 2: UT at Austin the living quarters were not integrated.  In fact, I lived in a co-op [cooperative] house where it was a voluntary racial integration but the dormitories were not integrated when I went there in the early '60s [1960s].  So I was the first--among the first wave--now African Americans were there and made the breakthroughs in the late '50s [1950s] and Heman Sweatt did some stuff before that.
Speaker 1: Right, Sweatt versus Painter [1950], the lawsuit around that--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Correct, he did some stuff before that but the early wave was the late '60s [1960s], I'm sorry '50s [1950s] like '58 [1958] somewhere around there, '57 [1957], '58 [1958] and then I came in the early '60s [1960s].  When I went the dormitories were not integrated and there was a lot of activity because it was the '60s [1960s] and I remember my peers going to a lot of demonstrations but I clearly also remember I didn't want to participate, I wanted to observe and write about it.  I remember clearly wanting to write about it and observe it but not being so caught up in carrying a picket sign.  There was a lot of picket sign carrying and the co-op house it was on a voluntary test integration; Whitis, W-H-I-T-I-S Co-op House, 2500 Whitis Avenue.  Whitis was the name of the school, W-H-I-T-I-S but it was probably somebody's name; named after some person.
Speaker 1: I would hope so.
Speaker 2: But it was 2500 Whitis Avenue where the co-op house was.  It was this big--it was wonderful two story Victorian house with these double balconies and all like that.  It was a great place because it had the wraparound porch, I loved it.  But at any rate it was a voluntary integration thing.  So half the house was white, half the house was black, wonderful experience.
Speaker 1: So that's where you--let me get back to the question about how did you decide--University of Texas your father [Frank McLeod Adams] was against it, right?
Speaker 2: Right, well he wanted me to go to North Texas which was a predominantly white school but blacks were beginning to integrate it and my sister went there in '58 [1958].
Speaker 1: So there is black history and a track record at that school, at the University of Texas?
Speaker 2: I think it was more like probably close but probably equal, about the same because they were both state schools.
Speaker 1: The University of Texas is a huge place.  It's much bigger than--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I remember when I went the population was twenty-two thousand but it's way--three or four times maybe not four but well over double that now.
Speaker 1: You were in the largest university in the country.
Speaker 2: Absolutely but at the time it was twenty-two thousand and the blacks were a very small percentage, very small percentage and lived in designated spots on the campus.
Story_ID: 42173
Speaker 1: So now did you graduate with honors from Lincoln [High School, Dallas, Texas]?
Speaker 2: No-oh, from Lincoln, yes but not UT [University of Texas, Austin].
Speaker 1: I'm not getting there, I'm trying to get you there first-(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: No, I was in the top ten percent--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: So your grades helped you get in, I guess?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Did you get a scholarship?
Speaker 2: No scholarship, my dad [Frank McLeod Adams] worked for every penny carrying that mail bag.  I remember he would send me two dollars.  When they would write a letter, it would be two dollars and I would keep that two dollars and didn't have to spend it because the Lord, I guess, provided all my needs.  But I remember that two dollars would be in the letter and I didn't have to spend it, I would keep that two dollars.  But he worked for every penny that--I never worked, I never worked.
Speaker 1: You never worked in school?
Speaker 2: I never worked, I just studied and my dad carrying that mailbag and the same thing with my sister [Doris Adams Serrell].  That mailbag paid for my sister--she didn't work either.  That mailbag paid for her education, no scholarships and mine; my dad did it.
Speaker 1: Okay so had you visited the University of Texas before you started?
Speaker 2: I had not visited and again because it had this journalism link to it and the counselor and there were some recruiters who came and talked about it and I just fixated on it.  But I had to really convince Frank Adams to allow his daughter to go to unplowed territory.  He didn't know anything about the school, he knew about North Texas [University of North Texas] in Denton [Texas], he didn't know about UT in Austin and so he finally decided.  I don't remember how I convinced him but he finally decided that he would allow me to go and we did.  You know, he family went down when it was moving in day.  Everybody went down and it was okay.
Story_ID: 42174
Speaker 1: Now that fall [1962] there was one of the iconic events of the Kennedy administration [1961-1963]; there was the Cuban Missile Crisis [Cold War-era conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union characterized by the USSR's deployment of nuclear missiles to Cuba] that fall.  Did you all wonder if you're going live through this?
Speaker 2: You know what, I thought about the tension of that but I don't remember the feeling, the tension of it.  I just remember it being a big news story but I don't remember a fear behind it.  But it was a lot in the news, the fear that I do remember was the Kennedy assassination.  Now that was a fear and there were all kinds of memories about that.  I was on campus when it came and I wrote about it in my little diary type book, I didn't call it a diary but I wrote about all of that and wrote essays about it and what have you.  So that was the fear but the missile crisis I just remember it being a big thing in the news.
Story_ID: 42175
Speaker 1: Okay while in your freshman year, how did you do?
Speaker 2: How did I adjust?  Oh it was just a wonderful--in my memory it was just a wonderful experience in my life because again my existence had been such a protected, insulated, close knit community environment and so to go away to another city, leaving Dallas [Texas] and going to Austin [Texas] by myself was just a new adventure.  And I just had a ball--I fell in love with Austin.  Austin is a great town and all of these--meeting all of these people of different ethnicity on campus.  Although the-well, I guess I'd say that that was an ethnic thing too because it was an experimental integration where the whites who lived at the co-op house voluntarily agreed to live there.  So there was a lot of cultural interaction within the co-op house.  But all of that was just so new and wonderful and then walking around the campus and being in the classroom with all of these different ethnicities and cultures and the environment of the--I remember Marian Anderson.  I forget when she died but somehow she was big role model with me because of her singing.  I wish I could remember what year but for some reason I remember getting to hear her.
Speaker 1: Live on campus, did she come?
Speaker 2: That's what I'm remembering, I hope I didn't dream this but in my scrap book I have a program of her program.  So obviously she must have--I wish I could remember what year she died [1993] but in my memory I have put it as a--her coming to campus somehow and I got to hear her and it was a big thing because she was such a role model with me.  All of that kind of stuff, the campus just presented all of this world experience and again my dad [Frank McLeod Adams] growing up had always tried to instill in my sister and I, he would draw a circle and he would put a little dot in the circle and he would say the circle is the rest of the world and this dot is you.  And what this shows you is that you are living this little portion of all the other experiences that this circle on the globe represents.  And that did open up to me that there was more outside my little insulated environment than I could know.  So this university [University of Texas at Austin] opened the door to what all else was out there in this world that I didn't know about growing up.  That I only knew about in books that I read about and on TV.  So it was a wonderful experience.  Now there were some racial things that happened but for some reason I don't remember them as being painful.  The only--and I wouldn't really use the word painful but I--what kind of sticks out is again I was a singer and I tried out and got a part in this play and there was a musical number and I was supposed to sing with a white guy and they ended up cutting the scene out because it would have been me and a white guy and so the way they solved it was they just cut that scene out.  And I remember that and them trying to convince me why that made sense and again this was the early '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: What did they say, how did they try to make sense out of it?
Speaker 2: Well, they acknowledged that it was a decision that was made on race but they explained it that it order for the play to go on and for people to feel comfortable watching it, it was best to just remove that scene and that's what they did.  And I remember I was not a person who challenged.  Remember I was a--I followed rules and I remember thinking how silly it was but I went along with it because it made sense to me that the greater good was for the play which now does not make sense to me but at the time I remember rationalizing.  But I remember walking home thinking well now that's just really silly but I didn't--it didn't--I didn't choose the path organizing a protest which I easily could have done because that was the way things were handled.  You protested those types of things but that was how I rationalized it.  So that was one of the racial things and one of the other memories is in the following year after I went--where somewhere early on in the dormitories did integrate and I remember one of my close friends that I had gone to high school [Lincoln High School, Dallas, Texas] with, Jo Mertrick Franklin (ph.) chose to go and be one of the test people who integrated Kinsolving Dormitory and so that was a big thing.
Speaker 1: So did he survive?
Speaker 2: Oh she did well.
Speaker 1: She did, okay.
Speaker 2: But she was one of the protesters.  She was a very active protester and so my method was to observe and write about it.  Her method was to carry the picket signs.
Story_ID: 42176
Speaker 1: Now this is--these are days before there were like black student unions on campus.  Was there any kind of black organizations on campus?
Speaker 2: Not at that time.  They came before I left; I think right at the time of my graduation was when they started.  I graduated in '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: Yeah I think in like '65 [1965], '66 [1966] or something.
Speaker 2: Yeah and so the dormitory integrated in '65 [1965] and I graduated in '66 [1966] and so that had started at that time but when I first went there were no unions.
Speaker 1: Were there any other black journalist students on campus?
Speaker 2: There was one girl, I think she was a year older than me and so she was the only other one.
Speaker 1: Did she go on to become a journalist?
Speaker 2: She did, I don't remember where but she did get a degree in journalism and went somewhere and practiced it.
Speaker 1: Did you all get together or did you kind of feel like where you shouldn't really associate with each other so much to make people think all black people--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, I know exactly what you are talking about; there was not really an opportunity for that.  We had no classes together and so that would have not been a reason for us to really pass each other in the hall.  She lived, I think, there were two co-ops [cooperative] houses and I think she lived in the one next door to me and so we would see each other when the two co-ops houses would have joint events but we had no classes together.
Story_ID: 42177
Speaker 1: Alright.  Okay so you said that you were--who were some of your favorite teachers or role models at the University of Texas [Austin]?
Speaker 2: Well, the one that comes to mind is Professor Gardiner, I forget her last name but she was a former military person and that's the way she lived her life.  Very, very authoritative and I remember one of her rules was that no matter how good your writing was, if you misspelled one word, you got an automatic F.  She was a little person about my size, an Anglo but very authoritative.  And boy she ran her classroom like a military operation and we were terrified of her and terrified of misspelling a word because nobody wanted to get an automatic F.  And, so she really sticks out in my mind because it really taught me to be at my best and I was always a very perfectionist type person, that's a syndrome, I guess perfectionist syndrome.  And I don't thing I ever got an F but I was terrified of getting an F and she's just a-professor Gardiner is just a real big memory.  Now, oh gosh I'm embarrassed, I just forgot his name but one of the deans of the journalism school and I'm embarrassed that I've forgotten his name but he sticks out because he was a person I could--I went to, I guess, a couple of times and--for just kind of counsel on what to do about difficult subjects that I was wrestling with.  I remember I wrestle with government and never made good grades but I managed to get out of government and--oh I'm embarrassed I can't remember his name.
Speaker 1: He was the dean of journalism?
Speaker 2: Right, and he was big in my life at the time and he was a very empathetic person, Anglo.  But he was a good listener and he would just listen and he was not judgmental and he was very helpful to me and so I had an emotional tie to him because he helped me.  I felt that he was a life line and I remember when it was graduation time, I wasn't sure, I was sweating one of those courses and it was something like a government course.  I was sweating it and whether I would be able to graduate and I mean it was eleventh hour.  My parents [Frank McLeod Adams and Nettie Ivory Adams] had come to town and my dad had told me, chief I don't know if I'd be able to economically do this--continue to do this.  You're really going to have to come out and so I was sweating graduation.  And, so they were already in town and I went to the dean and he did tell me that I made it and I remember going back to the co-op house and when I told my dad, he went out on the porch and he walked to the balcony of it and he looked up and I could just see him--my dad was not really a demonstrative religious person, my mom was.  But I could tell that he was thanking God that his daughter was going to graduate and I just remember this scene of seeing him standing there, his back was turned to me and he just had his quiet time there on the porch.  And I could tell that it was a load off his shoulders because I can imagine he was saying if she doesn't come out of here, what are we going to do.  I guess whatever finances in the family were going on he knew that he just couldn't financially do it anymore.  And so when I graduated, it was just a big relief and I remember the scene of him out there on the porch and I graduated.  It was a close call but the dean was the one who gave me the news that I had made it.

Speaker 1: Now did you ever have--what was the most difficult--I mean you say government was difficult--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: For some reason and I don't know why because I was a reader and excuse me (blows nose) I don't know why that was.  I was a reader; there was a lot of reading.  I did okay in my journalism classes; there was really no problem but I struggled in my other subjects and it was difficult for me because I had always been in the top ten percent, A and B student in high school [Lincoln High School, Dallas, Texas].  I was learning and grades making was not a problem but then, of course, it was a black high school which says that for some reason when you get out in the real world in multi ethnic environments, the rules were different and so us African American students had to contend with that but we were the top ten percent going to those state universities and you really had to struggle when the stakes were lifted higher.  I remember I burned a lot of midnight oil to just struggle to make it and so why I was sweating that class, I don't remember but for some reason I just managed to get out.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's interesting.  You never had a problem with writing?
Speaker 2: Never, no problem with writing or journalism things but the other courses, I struggled and I was never a science or well gosh math I was absolutely terrible.  Even in high school, I didn't do well--that well in math but I could somehow--it was okay, you know.  But math--science was not big with me, math was certainly not big.  And, so those things I struggled with but managed.

Speaker 1: So what were your prospects when you were on the verge of graduation what did you think--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well you always looked to your hometown papers.  I knew the black press was open to me because I was an intern every summer at the 'Post Tribune' [The Dallas Post Tribune], the black paper and so that was always an option but you would try your hometown daily which I did.  So after graduation, I tried the hometown daily and Julia Scott Reed who became my mentor who was the woman that I first connected with in the auditorium when she spoke.  She had been hired as a columnist to write about the black communities.  So I remember walking into the newsroom and seeing her sitting there and as the story goes, they had her desk prominently toward the entry so you would see her.
Speaker 1: She was the first, right?
Speaker 2: She was the first but she wrote only about the black community.  So when I was hired, I was the first to write citywide.
Speaker 1: Now I read that when you applied the first time--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: I was not hired.  Buster Haas who was one of the executives in the newsroom interviewed me and--I don't remember what he told me but I was not hired.

Speaker 1: What did you learn at the Post Tribune and what was--I mean as opposed to what you were learning at the University of Texas [Austin]?
Speaker 2: Well, when I was at the 'Post Tribune' [The Dallas Post Tribune], I learned about putting a paper out because I was automatically a reporter but when you were at the black press, you did a little bit of everything.  So there was all of this Neanderthal equipment back then.  I think liner type things and I forgot a lot of the names but old, dinosaur press stuff and you did page maker so I would help put the pages out and do reporting and help the editor.  So you got a little bit of everything which was good training for production at that time.  So I learned a lot about the community [Dallas, Texas] because the community would come into the paper there and I got to know a lot of the big people in the black community and the parts of the black community outside my little enclave of a community where I grew up.  So it was good training and so that's what I would do during the summer.
Speaker 1: Okay and so when you applied at 'The Dallas Morning News' and then you took a job at the 'Post Tribune,' is that what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, no what happened was I applied at 'The Morning News' and then my very first job after college was at Collins Radio Company and I worked--I was a technical editor for the manuals for the NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] Space Program.  They did the public--the instruction manuals for a tracking antenna for the NASA Space Program and at some point I had top secret clearance and we worked on these top secret projects but I would edit and proofread the technical manuals. And so I worked at Collins Radio Company, I think about four years or so.

Speaker 1: A month after you graduated, Charles Whitman starts shooting people from the tower at the University of Texas [Austin].
Speaker 2: I graduated in the early summer of '66 [1966] and came home and then about a month later, this big news story, I think in August of '66 [1966] I believe it was, was that Charles Whitman had gone up to the tower and killed a bunch of students and the thought was and the talk in the family was wow you just missed that.  Friends would say, "Norma, you sure is glad you graduated because as nosy as you are, you would have been right trying to interview the guy or been out there trying to observe and see what was going on and you would have been blown away."  And so yeah, but I just narrowly missed Whitman's killing--shooting from the tower.  Now President Lyndon Baines Johnson did speak at my graduation because his daughter, Lynda Bird was in my class, she was a classmate.  So she and I, Lyndon Johnson's daughter, Lynda Bird graduated the same year I did.  So President Johnson spoke at my graduation and I remember sitting there in the graduation class with my cap and gown on and there is the president delivering our graduation speech.
Story_ID: 42182
Speaker 1: I don't know how to rephrase this but I think everybody I interview that grew up in Texas in those days, it would just seem like you would have such a connection to the rest of the world.  So many stories centered on what Texas was doing with Johnson [President Lyndon B. Johnson] being the president, Kennedy [President John F. Kennedy] being assassinated here and other things.  I don't know, it just seems like you--did you feel like--I don't know if you ever--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No I didn't because again I still had that old community mentality; I guess is the best word I can think of.  I was just a community girl even though my dad with his circling the dot about the rest of the world, I thought of the world from my community's perspective.  Now I was very, very interested in everything that was going on in the world but I didn't think of it in terms of Texas being my state and Texas' position in the rest of the world.  I thought of it more as south Dallas [Texas] and the rest of the world for some reason, I don't know why.
Speaker 1: There's a good reason, I guess because you're--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: And even now, I mean even though I don't live--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: That was your experience growing up.
Speaker 2: My role, my griot assignment on this earth, on this planet is to tell the story of my people and so that's how I looked at the world.  That's my griot assignment for being here.
Speaker 1: Okay at some point that becomes your official model, I guess or your commitment.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and the way I approached my job at 'The Morning News' [The Dallas Morning News], I may be jumping ahead, was that I was there to tell the story of my people and that's what I still do and again I don't remember if we've talked about it but UN [United Nations] Ambassador Adlai Stevenson had a saying, he spoke to some graduates somewhere and he told them as they were at the graduation talk, 'and as you leave this place', this is a paraphrase, but, 'as you leave this place, remember why you came' and that spoke to me because I always remember why I came to my job which was to tell the story of the people I knew who looked like me and that my dad was reading the paper and not seeing their story told.  So my assignment on the planet as a griot representing my people was to go and tell it--go and tell our story and that's still is the way I look at it.  Like it or not, want to or not whether I want to or not, that's my assignment and--that's my assignment and I'm sticking to it.

Speaker 1: Okay so I guess this is in 1968 that you left Collins and the NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] work?
Speaker 2: It was--I believe it was '69 [1969], I think.  I don't remember why I went to the 'Post Tribune' [The Dallas Post Tribune] but for some reason I went and worked at the 'Post Tribune.'  I don't remember if they made it worth my while, I can't remember why I went there.
Speaker 1: I don't want to skip over to Bloom [The Sam Bloom Agency].  You worked for Bloom too, right? Bloom Advertising agency?
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay now I'm getting the sequence.  I was at Collins Radio Company then I went to Bloom, yeah and worked as a reproduction person and then I first was a reproduction person, traffic manager, I think it was called traffic manager, and then I became a copy advertising copywriter and that's when I was able to use my writing.  But when I first got the job, I helped with production and would carry the ads from one department to the next and helping make sure that it was on schedule and that this part had come in at the time and all of that.  So I was helping produce the ads but then I got to be a copywriter and wrote the ads on different accounts.
Speaker 1: Now Bloom had Sam Bloom the founder had worked in the Kennedy administration, right? Or volunteered or--(unclear)
Speaker 2: You know what I didn't know a lot about his personal life but I just remember Sam Bloom being the big man and I would see him.  He would come through the office and what have you but I didn't know a lot about him personally.  And then his son, Bob, I think his son's name was, he had a big leadership role and so I remember the two of the Blooms, the dad and the son.  So I worked a couple of--three or four years, I don't remember--two or three years at Bloom.  I remember now what happened-how I ended up at 'The Post Tribune.'  I was at Bloom and rocking along well as a copywriter and then one of these account executives came and talked to my boss who was Eve Klevinger, (ph.) a Jewish woman and she and I were pretty close and I remember for some reason this account executive objected to a black person writing his copy and I think I overheard Eve talking to him and trying to convince him that it was okay for me to write his copy.  I believe Eve eventually came to me and said well he doesn't want you on this account and I remember I went home.  I had forgotten this until you asked this.  I remember I went home and I believe I was married by then and I think I talked to my husband.
Speaker 1: Right, you got married in '68 [1968] right after Dr. King [Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated, April 6th, I think it was?
Speaker 2: That's right, so I would have been--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: April 6th was when I married in '68 [1968] and so I remember going home and I've talked to parents and my husband, Henry Adolphus Wade (ph.) was my husband, and I decided that I would just leave.  So I wrote a--when emotional things happen, I put it in words.  So I wrote a letter to Eve, my boss and I thanked her because she really had been an influence in my life and I thanked her for all that she had taught me and how she had been in my life.  And I ran across the other day a note that she wrote me back and she said wow you really got me, she said you brought tears to my eyes and she said I'm really going to miss you, I hate that you've decided to leave and she said but I--the company was in her blood.  She was tethered to it and so she wished me well but that's why I left because of that incident and the paper where I had spent all my summers, welcomed me.  And that's how I ended up working full time at 'The Dallas Post Tribune' and so I worked there a couple of years and then that's when 'The Morning News' came to me and there's a story about how 'The Morning News came' to me.
Story_ID: 42184
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah so in your years at the Post Tribune was there anything significant that happened that you remember?  Was that '72 [1972] to '74 [1974]?
Speaker 2: I just remember having a good time with my own people at The Post Tribune [The Dallas Post Tribune] and I was the assistant.  My title was assistant to the editor and again, I did everything.  You did the pages and I helped.  I was kind of like a traffic manager as well with the paper there making sure that the stories were--I did reporting so I would report it and then I would help to put it in--helped to see that it got put in type and we would put the pages together.  And so I helped with production and to see that everything was on schedule.  I remember a big thing with me was that I didn't like the flow because there were bottlenecks and I remember--look I'm a big thing about flow.  I even do that in my head.  Whenever I walk into any kind of operation even at church, even in the kitchen and people are making food and I'm always observant well now that person should be standing over there and they should go there, they should go here and then this should fly.  I'm big about that and so anyway I observed how the paper was being put together and I asked my boss, Dickey Foster who was the editor, if she would allow me to realign stuff.  I remember that on production night, we were there forever.  I mean it was just late when we would get out of there and she allowed me to put things together in a different way.  We got out of there so--I mean like a couple of hours earlier than we had been and then it-you know--another awakening was that hey I'm pretty good at this flow thing, you know.  Then I would help do that, keep things on task and flowing and all like that.  So I did things like that.  My title was assistant to the editor so I was a reporter, assistant to the editor and I helped get production out.
Speaker 1: Okay so just by changing the position on some of the functions you were able to speed the process along.
Speaker 2: Correct you change who was doing what and the way that they were doing it and what came next and how much time they would spend on certain steps.  I don't remember what all the steps were but this person was doing this and then they would take it over there and have to wait for this and then they would have to take it back over here and take it back over there and it just was--it was running around in a maze.  But in my head I could see well if she would do this and then take it here and they do this and spend this amount of time and then take it here and spend this amount of time, it would get over here so much quicker and it just made perfect sense in my head and when we did it, it cut out a couple of hours.

Speaker 1: Now Buster Haas who was he now?
Speaker 2: He was over hiring in the newsroom.  He was an exec in the newsroom.
Speaker 1: This was in Dallas [Texas]?
Speaker 2: 'The Dallas Morning News.'  So there was a series of murders in the black community.  Convenient store owners were being murdered and it was a big story.  So this would have been the early '70s [1970s] and it was affecting the city because whites were being killed too but it was largely happening in a lot of stores in the black community but white store owners were being killed.  'The Morning News' wanted to cover the story and they needed someone within the community--they wanted to do a piece that told how this series of murders was affecting not only the city but the black community as well.  Somehow Buster--I guess--well I had applied for it so Buster Haas knew of me and he really did have my interest at heart.  Buster Haas was a good person.  He was a great person.  He reminded me of my dean back in school, same personality and I think he really did look for an opportunity to get me in.  So anyway they wanted to do this story and so, you know, the story is opportunity doesn't knock on your door, you have to go out and get it.  Opportunity came to my house, Buster Haas came to my house where I lived and knocked on my door and told me they wanted to do this piece and that I could do it as a freelance writer and I went out and interviewed a lot of people in the community, store owners and neighborhood people and put the story together and did it and submitted it and it ran banner across page one and I was hired that week and that's how I got hired because they were very impressed with the story and the perspective that I was able to bring to it.  The value of being an African American reporter was that I could get into the community, I knew where the bodies--well not the literal bodies were buried, bad pun but I knew where all the players were and I could get to them and that's what I did.  So they saw my value and I was hired and that's how I got on, that's how I got hired.
Speaker 1: Did the police ever solve the case?
Speaker 2: I don't remember who it was but the case was ultimately solved.  That's a good question, I'd like to back and research that but it took--I remember it took awhile because when it was happening, I mean nobody had a clue and I did not do the final story, whoever did the final story I don't know it would be good to research that.  But my story was to give the inside view, the view from inside the community which is what I did.
Speaker 1: Okay what did the community think about that?
Speaker 2: Everybody was terrified, mystified, baffled, terrified, scared.  It was a scary situation because nobody knew where they would strike next.  People were serious; they were killing the store owners, the clerks.  They were killing clerks not store owners but the clerks.  A lot of owners did clerk their own stores.
Speaker 1: Were they being robbed or just killed?
Speaker 2: They would rob them and shoot them, fatally shoot them.
