 Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Thursday, August 13, 2015, and I am in Locust Grove,  Mayes County, Oklahoma, visiting with Dr. David Fleming as part of the  Cowboys in Every County oral history project. Thank you so much for  joining me today.  Fleming Glad to be here.  Nykolaiszyn Dr. Fleming, let   s begin and learn a little bit more about you. Could you tell  me the year you were born and where you were born?  Fleming I was born in 1960 in Garden Grove, California, actually. My father is from  here in Locust Grove, and he had moved to California for work actually.  That   s where he met my mother. That   s where I was born. I lived there in  Anaheim until I was seven years old, and we moved back to the family farm,  I guess, is the best way to say that, southwest of Locust Grove. That   s where  I grew up.  Nykolaiszyn What did your father do in California?  Fleming He actually was an upholsterer. He worked for McDonnell Douglas and did  upholstery and carpet in aircraft, yes, the passenger, I think, commercial  aircraft.  Nykolaiszyn Talk to me a little bit about growing up on the family farm.  Fleming Oh, it was wonderful, you know. We had cows, chickens. I even raised  chickens. It was, well, probably when I was about eleven years old,  somewhere around there, I started raising chickens. I   d raise pullets and sell  them. There used to be a little local sale here. There used to be a sale barn  where they   d sell cattle. They also had a flea market, basically. I would raise  chickens and take them. That   s my first Ag project. I would take them and  sell them. It was wonderful. We played with June bugs on strings in the, or  5  in the summer actually, when they came out, run around barefoot. I  absolutely enjoyed it. I wouldn   t trade it for anything. Wonderful memories.  Nykolaiszyn Did you have chores growing up on the farm?  Fleming Oh my gosh, yes. Chores started early. You know, you had to feed and water  everything and clean up. Yeah, chores started early and ran late. There was  always chores after school for sure, and I had to take off those school  clothes and do the chores. Plenty of chores, and I think it   s a good thing.  You know, I think it, all the kids, especially my grandkids, they need more  chores, I think. It helps instill a sense of discipline and work ethic. That   s a  good thing.  Nykolaiszyn Talk to me a little bit about where you attended school here in Mayes  County.  Fleming Locust Grove from the third grade through senior, and of course, played  football and several other different things. I actually didn   t go through the  FFA program. I went through the 4-H program. Enjoyed that, but I started  wrestling and football. Because of that, I didn   t have enough time. Chores   It made it difficult to find time to do everything. I did mainly football and  sports, a lot of sports, of course. Graduated from Locust Grove in 1979. It  had been my dream since eleven years old to be a veterinarian. There wasn   t  but one place to go, and that was for OSU. I had spent my high school years  preparing for OSU and was lucky enough to get a scholarship, academic  scholarship to OSU. That was my main goal, I guess, as I became older.  Nykolaiszyn What got you kind of interested on the veterinarian track when you were  younger?  Fleming I can tell you almost to the day. I was eleven years old, and we had some  horses. I had one colt that I was very fond of, and I   d handled it from a  weanling and everything else. First horse I ever broke. He developed these  bumps, and I didn   t know what they were. We called   the veterinarian was  out of Pryor  Oklahoma . At that time, it was Dr. Jaggers. He came and  looked at the horse, and I was just enthralled with him.    My gosh, this guy   s  a veterinarian, and he has lots of knowledge. Look how he handles the  animals.    From that point on, I wanted to be a veterinarian. There was no  question, no doubt. My son, for years, he couldn   t decide what he wanted to  do. I couldn   t understand that one bit because I knew the whole time.  I think that   s part of the problems anymore with young people is there   s so  many choices, so many things you can do. Anything   s possible, you know.  I   ve had the opportunity now to be in several different countries, and you  see how the opportunities that those folks have are very limited. You know,  most of them are in socioeconomic situations that they   ll never be able to  6  escape from. Here in the United States, you can do anything. You can be  anything. It   s just however hard you want to work and apply yourself. I  think that   s part of the problem, but I didn   t have that. I knew what I wanted  to do. I wanted to be a veterinarian.  Nykolaiszyn Would you start doctoring things as you were growing up?  Fleming Oh, I tried, but I didn   t have much knowledge  (Laughter) All the farmers  try to doctor as much as they can before they call the veterinarian, you  know. Veterinarians cost money. Of course, my grandfather had cows all of  his life, and of course there was all kinds of home treatments, home  remedies. Kerosene cured everything. Sure, yeah, we tried to treat them at  home the best we could, but you know, there   s situations where you have to  have the medicine and the knowledge of how to use it in order to get them  better. Yes, we did lots of home treatment, I guess.  Nykolaiszyn In this part of the state, is it common for a lot of students to head down to  Stillwater?  Fleming No  Well, I guess let me say that again. For different majors and stuff, there  is, yes. You know, I think there   s a pretty good draw, especially for the Ag  program here, the FFA program. The instructor is Joe Bob Cunningham.  He   s a graduate of OSU. I think all of his kids are graduates of OSU, and he  really emphasizes agriculture degrees that OSU has and not just agriculture  degrees but other degrees. He   s been, I think, a tremendous plus. Plus, you  know, the kids here do a lot of contests at OSU. There   s actually a decent  amount I think, I don   t know what the percentage is, of people that end up  going to OSU because of the opportunities there. A lot of them go locally.  You know, there   s some local colleges that they go to. NSU  Northeastern  State University , a lot of people go there for teaching degrees.  When I went, there was just two of us from our class that went to OSU, and  of course, it was oh my gosh  We didn   t go to NEO  A M College  or any  of the junior colleges. This guy, Clifford Lemons and I, we played football  together. We went straight to OSU, and my gosh, you talk about a shock.  Coming from Locust Grove, Oklahoma, and going to Stillwater, you know,  Stillwater seemed like a big metropolis. (Laughs) It did at that time.  I think probably one of my greatest challenges when I got there was  studying. I thought I knew how to study. I thought I had decent study habits.  I didn   t have study habits, truthfully, and that was probably the biggest  shock is when I got down there and realized just how serious everybody  was. Each instructor was serious about their class, and they really expected  you to learn that stuff.  7  Of course, wanting to be a veterinarian, I realized that my GPA was  everything. Yeah, my first semester was the shock of my life. I came home  after the first semester and discussed it with my father and said,    You know,  I don   t know. I have to have a high GPA.    I think I had a, it was a 2.75 at  the end of my semester, and I said, you know,    That   s not going to work. I   ll  never get in with that.    I withdrew for a year, actually, and had to really  think about, you know,    Is that really what I want to do? Was I really going  to put that much effort into it?    After working as an electrician, actually, for  a year, I   d made my mind that I was going to go back. When I went back,  see, I started in the fall of    79, and then I didn   t go back until, actually, the  fall of    82. It was two years. I went back in fall of    82 and stayed with it.  Made the grade that time. I think I was too na  ve and not quite  knowledgeable enough when I first went down there.  Nykolaiszyn When was the first time you came to campus? Was it   ?  Fleming When I first came to campus was the spring of 1978. My wrestling coach at  that time, Don Hiale, wanted to take us down there (there was, I don   t  remember, three or four of us) and show us the campus. He had graduated  from OSU. He took us down there, and that was actually my first time on  the campus. I enjoyed it immensely, but you know, he warned us. He said,     You know, when you come down here, there   s lots of fun down here. If  you   re not careful, you   ll spend way too much time on the fun and not  enough time studying,    and I   m guilty. I   m guilty. My first semester, I had a  lot of fun. You know, we went to parties and all the activities. You know.  There was something, actually more than one thing, going on every day,  activities of any kind. Because of that opportunity, you can kind of get  wrapped up in that social aspect of school and sometimes miss the academic  or don   t pay enough attention to the academic part of school.  Nykolaiszyn When you initially went down, how did you get down there? Did your  parents take you down?  Fleming Actually, no, I drove. You know, I was a graduate then.  Nykolaiszyn What were you driving?  Fleming I was driving a 1979 Monte Carlo. I bought it. I   d saved my money. I went  and bought a new car before I went to OSU. That   s exactly what I   tried to  buy something that had decent fuel mileage and everything else. That   s  exactly what I drove down.  Nykolaiszyn Where did you live on campus?  Fleming Stout Hall. It had been a female dormitory. They, that year, had remodeled it  and made it into a male dormitory. We stayed in Stout Hall, no air-  8  conditioning, fans only, second floor. That   s just where I started out at. I met  some wonderful guys down there. Had too much fun, but I really, really  enjoyed it because at that time, we had to eat in Willard, which was still a  girls    dormitory, a female dormitory. That   s where we   d have to eat. That   s  where we   d meet all the girls. We   d just go over and eat. They wouldn   t  serve food on Sunday at that time. They   d serve breakfast, but they wouldn   t  serve food. You had to come up with a way to eat. Towards the end of the  semester, you   re broke. You   ve spent all your money. It was hard to find  something to eat on Sunday without having to pay, go to a restaurant and  pay for it. That was quite challenging. Enjoyed it. Really did. Really, really  enjoyed it.  Nykolaiszyn Was your initial roommate Clifford?  Fleming No. Actually, my initial roommate, I switched. This gentleman was from  Yukon, and I   ll just be honest with you. I don   t remember his name. Him  and I had completely different styles. He wasn   t a bad guy, but we had  completely different styles. That didn   t work well, and then they put me in, I  switched rooms to a gentleman. His name was Bill. I don   t remember what  his last name was. I   m remembering. I don   t remember what his last name  was, but he was a wild guy as well. He wasn   t there to go to school. He was  there to party, and I was just amazed. I would wake up. He   d come in two or  three o   clock in the morning every night. They used to have steam tunnels,  you know, the tunnels underneath the campus where they   d run all the steam  pipes and everything. Those guys would go down in there, and just amazing,  some of the stories he would tell.  That was the rest of the semester. Like I say, I don   t remember his last  name. Clifford and I didn   t room together. We thought it wouldn   t be a good  thing. (Laughter) We decided that that wouldn   t be a good thing, that we  needed to room with someone that perhaps was a little bit more academic  minded than we were. Clifford stayed that second semester. Like I said, I  came home, but Clifford stayed that second semester. I don   t remember. I  kind of lost touch with him. He didn   t graduate. He stayed a few years and  then went to, his dad was a construction worker. That   s what my dad ended  up being was a construction worker. They knew each other. Clifford finally  went back to the, or went to the construction field. He   s done very well for  himself. Very, very good guy.  Nykolaiszyn You took that semester off, reevaluated, worked a little bit. What was  motivating you to want to come back?  Fleming Well, I still had that desire to be a veterinarian. I went and worked, got in  the electricians    union, made pretty good money and everything, but I still  had that desire to be a veterinarian. It was stronger than anything else.  That   s why I came back.  9  Nykolaiszyn When you came back to campus, where   d you live?  Fleming I lived off-campus. I got married during that time as well. We bought a place  south of the fairgrounds. Bought a trailer house. Put it on there, and actually,  that was a good decision for me because I could come home, get away from  that, and study. That   s what I had to do. I had a lot of studying to do.  Actually, that worked out very well, and we lived there the whole eight  years, actually.  Nykolaiszyn Where did you meet your wife?  Fleming Here. She was from Locust Grove as well. She went to high school here,  graduated a couple years behind me.  Nykolaiszyn Kind of walk me through now. You   re back at OSU. Tell me about some  memorable classes you remember, instructors you remember     Fleming Oh my goodness.  Nykolaiszyn    pre-vet school.  Fleming Pre-veterinarian school, lots of good instructors. Probably one of the ones I  remember, and it   s sad enough, I don   t remember her name. She wasn   t  there very long. She was from Germany, but she taught American history,  interesting enough. I remember my first history test. At that time, they were  all essay. Had a little bit of multiple choice, but by far, all essay. I had a  chemistry test right after this history test. I was hurrying because chemistry  was one of my core requirements for veterinary school. I really studied hard  for this chemistry class. I just went, ripped right through this essay and  handed it in, and she stopped me. (Laughs) She said,    Are you sure you  don   t want to sit down and go back over this and maybe add a little more to  it?    Of course, stubborn man that I am,    Oh, no, no. It will be all right,    and  I got a sixty-five on that first one. I learned my lesson. When the instructor  tells you that you need to sit down and add a little bit more to your essay,  you better sit down and add a little bit more to your essay.  She was the nicest lady, just as kind as she could be. She didn   t speak  English all that well, but she did a wonderful job teaching American history.  She was one of the first ones that I really remember, and of course,  numerous teachers in that period of time. Probably the next one, I think, that  really, really comes to mind is the biochemistry teacher and it   s crazy, I  can   t remember his name. He was there forever. Sitting here trying to  remember his name. Biochemistry is a culling class, you know. You   ve got  to score well in that biochemistry class, and it   s not just for veterinary  school. For all medical professions, you have to go through the biochemistry  10  class. I don   t know. It was the middle of the semester, not quite the middle  of the semester, before fall break, and I had really studied hard for this class.  I was making a C, and that   s a five-hour class. That wasn   t going to work.  I went to Nelson, Dr. Nelson. That was his name. I went to him and made an  appointment. He was very busy, very hard. Did a lot of research. It was very  hard to get in there. I went in and sat down. He asked me,    Well, what do  you need?    I said,    Well, I   m working hard and studying in this class. I   m  only making a C, and I need to make a B. I would like to know, look over  my stuff. I would like to know what would be your suggestion. What should  I do to increase my grade?    He looked through his stuff and looked through  my test, and he threw them on his desk. He looked up, and he said,    Have  you ever thought about doing something else?    (Laughter) I mean, just like  that  I was floored  I said,    What do you mean?     He said,    Well, maybe you   re not cut out for this. You know, this class is  basically a class to determine whether you have the stuff to go to med school  or veterinary school or whatever or whether you don   t. You   ve got a C. I  think maybe you ought to be a plumber or maybe something like that.    I  mean, that   s exactly what he said. It just shocked me, and I said,    What do  you think I could do?    He said,    It doesn   t look like you could do much, so  just study harder. It looked like you better put more hours in studying.  You   re going to have to make an A on most of your tests at this point to  bring it up to a B.    He said,    I don   t see it,    was basically what he said. You  know, that didn   t do anything except motivate me, and maybe that may have  been his psychology behind that. I don   t know. If it is, my hat   s off to him. I  appreciate it. I   ve thought about him lots of times over the years after I got  in veterinary school and graduated.  Nykolaiszyn Did you make a B?  Fleming Yes, I ended up making a B. I appreciate it. He did motivate me, but I sure  didn   t appreciate being shocked, I think, quite that much. Those are  probably the two I remember the most. Of course, several other instructors  over that period of time, some very good Ag instructors. One of them, an  older gentleman taught, it was an international Ag class. It was a basic intro  to Ag. We talked about camels, basic treatment for camels, and some other  exotic livestock. Of course, at that stage in your, at my point, anyway,     Well, I   m never going to use something like that. This is not interesting.  It   s just a one-hour class.    I didn   t pay that much of attention. Well, I ended  up going to Africa for a year, and I   m glad he did teach us a little bit about  camels, because I ended up working on thousands of them. That goes to  show you, since you   re still in school, even those classes that you   re not  interested in, you better pay attention to those because you never know  what   ll happen in the long run.  11  Nykolaiszyn Wow. Your undergraduate degree was in animal science?  Fleming Animal science, pre-veterinary medicine. I don   t know if they still have that  option, but at that time, they had the option where you take that as your  major. If you applied and got into veterinary school before you completed  your requirements for that bachelor   s degree, your first couple of semesters  of veterinary school, they would apply those to that degree so you could  complete the requirements. That   s exactly what I did. I wasn   t awarded my  B.S. until after my first year of veterinary school.  Nykolaiszyn Did you work during this timeframe?  Fleming Oh my gosh, yes.  Nykolaiszyn Where   d you work?  Fleming Veterinary hospital. Actually, I worked several different places. I worked at  the swine barn, which used to be right west of the Holiday Inn, and Bob  Hope came at one time. This was several years ago, and he opened his  doors. He said this on the night that he was talking at OSU. He said,    I  opened my door to get this breath of beautiful, fresh Oklahoma air. Ugh, my  gosh  It stunk like crazy     (Laughter) Well, that was because there was a  swine farm right next to the Holiday Inn. I worked there for a few years, a  couple years, actually. I worked in the farrowing barn where you deliver  baby pigs, which, of course I just loved that, and then I went and worked at  the veterinary school. First I worked for the lab division taking care of the  rats, mice, all that type of stuff. Had a lot of research calves we took care of.  Then I worked for the veterinary school cleaning stalls. Mucking out stalls  was my glorious job. I   ve dealt with a lot of crap over the years. I worked  there all the way until after, I guess it was middle of the first semester of the  veterinary school, and after that, I couldn   t. You just couldn   t work.  I worked a small stint in one of the convenience stores. I had the bright ideal  that if I worked the midnight to seven shift, I could study during that slow  part of the night. Well, you know, my gosh, it was just a terrible effort just  to stay awake, and that didn   t work out very well. You didn   t get much  studying done, and at the time, I always had to, what I   d do is that semester,  I scheduled it so my classes would start at seven thirty. I   d get off work, go  straight to campus. I   d get all my classes out of the way, and then while my  wife was at work, we had a son by that time. He was at daycare. That   s  when I would sleep, try to sleep, in the afternoon. Well, that didn   t work out  at all. I ended up suffering from sleep deprivation, sitting in my classes  doing this, and I figured out real quickly that that wasn   t going to work.  12  After about, like I said, about the middle of my first semester of veterinary  school, you know, you got, my gosh, you average twenty-one hours a  semester, and almost all those classes have a lab. There   s just no time, just  absolutely no time. You have to be studying. You can   t be working  somewhere. For the last three years, three and a half years, I didn   t work at  all except during the summer. I did work during the summer.  Nykolaiszyn Let   s talk about your years at the veterinary school. Professors that come to  mind?  Fleming Oh, Dr. Breazile. He taught physiology, and my gosh, a brilliant guy. He  wouldn   t hesitate one bit to tell you that you weren   t very smart and that you  had a lot to learn. His tests were horrendous, but he was an excellent  instructor. He really was a very good instructor. Our anatomy instructors, it  was their last year, full year. I think they taught part of the second year.  They had been at the veterinary school forever, and you know, my gosh, if  you could just gleam a little bit of their knowledge, a third of their  knowledge, you   d be a wise person. That   s my same thought about the  Edmon Low Library. I used to sit in that library, and you look at all those  books. You think about all that written material. I used to think that, you  know, if a person could learn and maintain a third of the information that   s  in that library, you could be the wisest person in the world. Just incredible,  and they were the same way.  They were walking encyclopedias. They taught anatomy, and we had all of  our charts and everything they had made personally. We didn   t use charts  and illustrations much out of textbooks. They made them all, over the years,  by dissecting, and they were just incredible. Dr. Frahm, very good guy who  would go out of his way to help you. Of course, their tests were just  unbelievable.  Probably not the best positive memory. We had an immunology professor.  He was from England, and we sat down in class. You have this perception of  professional school, you know, that it   s all professional, very staunch, very  organized. He came in and sat down, and he said,    Look, I   m here because I  do research. I bring in lots of money doing this research.    I forget what  research he   d been doing at this point. He said,    I don   t have time to teach  this class, but they require me. This is a land grant university. I have to teach  a certain amount. I don   t have time. Something has to give. This is the deal.  We   ll meet every day, five, fifteen minutes, whatever it takes real quick to  go over it. That   s it. You   re on your own. You   ve got to study the book, and  you   ll pass the test.     He drew a box up there on the chalkboard, and he drew a small box way  over here up higher. He said,    What this amounts to, the first thing you have  to do, you have to learn the terminology of medicine. It   s a completely  13  different language. What you need to do for your first few weeks, you need  to get you a medical dictionary and basically memorize it. If you do that,  that separates you. That puts you in this box up here, which is a very small  box, and it separates you from the rest of the common swineherd in this  box.    I was sitting with a guy that was a buddy of mine from McAlester,  Oklahoma. He kind of jerked around. He looked at me, and he said (he had a  beard),    You know, I think that fellow needs a whupping.    (Laughter) I said,     You know, I can   t disagree with you a bit. I think he does  He   s quite high  on himself in his profession.    He was a veterinarian. There is truth to that,  but that was a heck of a way of putting it. Like I said, I don   t even remember  his name. Now, he was only there for just a couple of semesters, and he left.  That kind of hurt our opinion of professional school.  Our little group of guys there that I sit with, none of us quite grasped that or  agreed with that, but you know, you have to be proud of your profession. He  was very, very proud of his profession. Lots of other instructors, of course,  that I can remember. Most of them, I guess, are pretty well retired now. Dr.  Smith was a rural medicine veterinarian. They changed that term pretty  often. I don   t know exactly what it is now. It was a veterinarian that took  you out on farm calls. Really good guy. I   m in the military. He was in the  military at that time. He was a rough, gruff guy, but you learned a lot from  him. Dr. Dawson, he was there. He   s getting ready to retire. He   s from  India, and he was very knowledgeable about sheep and goats. Very, very  good guy. We had an instructor from New Zealand, and my goodness, I  can   t remember his name now. He was a very good instructor as well. Most  of the people that I had the opportunity to learn from there in veterinary  school, wonderful instructors, and very, very happy to have that opportunity  to learn from them.  Nykolaiszyn Would you have traditions within the vet school?  Fleming You know, they do. Of course they have the honors societies. Omega Tau  Sigma was a fraternity that I joined. They have three or four different  fraternities that you can join. Of course they all have their traditions about  meetings and gatherings, social functions, as far as that is concerned. The  university itself, we didn   t really have all that many traditions. There   s  always some. They   ve done more now. They   ve become much more  student-friendly over the years, and now, you know, they have what they  call a White Coat Ceremony, which I think is an excellent, excellent  program. Of course they always had your mixers where you met the  professors and you met the other students from the different classes. All  those were very good. They tried to socialize you as much as possible, and  especially us country guys that don   t always have the best social skills  anyway. It was very good, and like I said, I think now they even do a lot  more than what they used to have done.  14  Nykolaiszyn What was graduation like?  Fleming Oh, it was wonderful  Oh my gosh. You think about eight years of grueling,  studying of   some people, the academic setting, they absolutely prevail.  They blossom. That   s just right up their alley. For people like me, you  know, that was an arduous, painful process to drag me through all of that to  try to teach me something. Of course, to be able to graduate there in the  stadium with all those wonderful people, and the climax of a very long time  studying to get there. It was absolutely wonderful. Good time. Very good  time.  Nykolaiszyn Did you have a favorite place on campus?  Fleming Well, yes  Actually the Library. The Library, and then they   ve remodeled  the Student Union several times. I think every couple years it gets a remodel  anymore. At one time, on the fourth floor, there was an area there where  they had a little snack shack. I have no idea what the name of it was, a little  snack shack. On the east side of that was a set of large windows. They just  ran down the wall, and for some reason, I really liked studying there. I   d go  and sit and study. If it   d rain, the rain would hit the windowpanes, and it was  a very quiet area. It had a couple of televisions up there with soap operas on  them, I think, most of the day. That   s actually where I would go. If I wasn   t  studying in the library, I would go and sit there and study. Those are  probably my two favorite places. There used to be a dairy shack right across  from the Ag Hall, and they   ve tore that down and built a new building there.  I used to always go there, of course, and get coffee several times a day.  Those were probably my three hangouts, I guess, most of the time.  Nykolaiszyn So you   re studying a lot because it   s a very grueling program.  Fleming I had to   Nykolaiszyn Did you have any time for fun? Did you go to sporting events?  Fleming You know, this is the truth. I didn   t do all of that just because, you know, the  best way I can describe it, for me, I had to study at least four hours a day,  and I   m ADD. I   ll admit it, okay? If there   s any noise, if there   s a radio or  anything like that playing, I   m distracted because I   m going to pay attention  to whatever else that is. I had to study at least, like I said, about four hours  every night. The socialization had to be limited. Yes, we would. We would  go to some of the football games. At that time, OSU lost every game. Isn   t  that terrible to say? It   s the truth. You   d go to the football games, and at that  time, they allowed alcohol in. You   d go to the football game. Everybody  was drinking, and I can remember, oh, I don   t know, in the early    80s, I can  remember they blew up those great big beach balls. They would bounce  those things all over the stadium. You   d be sitting there. You   d actually be  15  paying more attention to where the beach ball was than what was going on  in the field. I mean, it   s sad, but it was true.  Those guys played hard and played their heart out, but my gosh, you know,  they   d win one or two, maybe three games a season. We did go to the  football games. I went to a few of the wrestling matches. Since I had  wrestled in high school, I was always interested in that. We   d go to a few of  the wrestling matches. You know, the animal science, they also are very  good about having social mixers. They had several different things. The  Block and Bridle Club would have shows and different things. I would go to  some of those, and we would go to some of those. We   d go to some of the  musicals there at the Seretean Center, and I   m not sure. Do they do that  somewhere else now, I guess? It   s been quite a while, I guess.  Nykolaiszyn They   re still doing the Seretean.  Fleming We   d do a few of those, but truthfully, most of my time was spent studying,  absolutely.  Nykolaiszyn As you   re getting close to graduation from vet school, did you have any idea  what you wanted to do next?  Fleming What I really wanted to do was equine work. Equine, mainly large animal,  was what I really wanted to do, what my interest was in. I   d done some  preceptors where I went to Texas, to Austin, down about east of Austin to an  exclusive equine clinic there and had done some equine work. Plus, I   d  already done some cow work. Well, actually we did it over at Pryor for a  little while and did cow work. At that time, I was young and ready to tackle  the large animal world and tried to really study hard on herd health, those  type of things. That was my direction, and that   s what I worked the hardest  towards. Now we   re just the opposite. You know, that   s interesting how that  works. Like I said, when I first got out, I worked at Pryor. Did mainly large  animal for a few years. I decided to put this clinic in here, and we were  about 87 seven percent large animal. Now we   re just the absolute opposite.  We   re 87 percent small animal, and actually, I just checked the other day.  We   re 89 percent small animal. Once again, a good thing you pay attention.  That   s one of my main things about veterinary school. You still have your  general degree. There   s a lot of talk and a lot of people wondering about  specialization. You know, should you go on   they have a large animal track  they   ve discussed, a small animal track, equine track, and I think that   s good  because the level of knowledge in each one of those species has grown  tremendously. The bottom reality is you don   t know. In a twenty-five, thirty-year,  or longer career time, you don   t know what you   re going to be doing.  When you start out with that general degree, you can go in any direction,  and I   m a perfect case of that as, you know. We   ve ended up doing more  16  small animal. If that   d been my only traditional training, I wouldn   t have  had that flexibility.  Nykolaiszyn Were you always interested in coming back home?  Fleming No  That was not my plan at all, actually. I worked at Pryor for a couple  years, and what I had planned on doing was going to a larger practice where  there were multiple veterinarians, preferably doing a lot of herd health work.  The reason I ended up here is my wife   s family farm, her father had passed  away, and her mother wanted to move off the farm. They wanted us to move  back and run it, and that was not in my plan. I was,    No, no.    When they  first asked, I said,    No, that   s not what I   m interested in doing,    but I finally  gave in and had never had a plan to come back to Locust Grove. Let   s face  it. These are good folks here, but this is one of those areas of Oklahoma  that   s socioeconomically challenged. Most people here are good folks,  working-class folks. Your mean average income is not the greatest, as is true  for an awful lot of Oklahoma. I knew all those things, but you know, I gave  in at the last. We moved back on the farm, and I went ahead and put this  practice in.  Nykolaiszyn Did you do that solo, or did you partner with other doctors?  Fleming No, just me, just me.  Nykolaiszyn Talk about some of the challenges of doing that.  Fleming Oh my gosh. It   s been a tremendous challenge  I wouldn   t recommend it for  anybody, you know. There was a long period of time, for years, especially  when we were doing mainly large animals, I would work seven days a week.  I would work fourteen to sixteen hours a day, especially in the spring, not  counting all the emergency calls at night. At that time, there was a lot of  dairies here, and dairy people start work at four thirty, five o   clock in the  morning. You   d always get a call somewhere around then. You know, cow  having trouble calving, milk fever cow, which is a cow that   s just fresh and  is low on calcium in their bloodstream. Always something. You   d get a  group of calls around then.  Well, then nine o   clock or so is when your small animal business starts  coming in. You have to take care of all those. The evening, all the folks that  get off of work come home and find something wrong with the cow, horse,  dog, whatever. You   d get another group of emergency calls late in the  evening. I did that for several years. Then finally one spring, which it was  extremely chaotic, I just about couldn   t make it. Just not enough sleep. I  finally decided,    You know what? This is not working. After all this time, I  love this job, but this is killing me.    I   m not the only one that   s been through  17  that. There   s been a lot of veterinarians through that. I made a decision now.     You know, we   re going to have to change something.     We went to having people haul their animals in. That was about 2000. We  built this facility in 2000 and built a nice large animal part back there and  said,    You know, you want large animal work, you   re going to have to bring  it here.    That started changing things a lot, you know, trying to be more  organized. That windshield time kills you. My gosh, you may run down  towards Tahlequah  Oklahoma , which is twenty-five miles from here. Your  next call may be over towards little Kansas  Oklahoma , which is about  twenty-five miles that way. That   s what was killing me, as far as timewise is  concerned. Started making some changes, and over time, like I said, it   s  changed us. Plus, we   ve had a change in the demographics here in this area.  You know, we   ve less cows, more people, and more people, more small  animal. Our area has changed, too, as well. Now I get lots of sleep, which is  wonderful. (Laughter) Yes, the lack of sleep, eating fast food every meal.  You   re just trying to grab what you could. I went through lots of pickup  trucks driving like a maniac, tearing those things up. Of course, it takes a  toll on your family life as well when you work all the time. You just don   t  have time left for your family, and that   s not a good thing. Like I said, I   m  not the only veterinarian that   s went through that. Several have done the  same thing. That was a very trying time, very trying.  Nykolaiszyn Are you seeing more exotics now, too, in this area?  Fleming We did for a while. That built up until the state changed their rules, which  wasn   t a bad thing. I   ve got a real good story about that. I used to have a  picture of her. I don   t know what we   ve done with it, but we had a client  named Joe Parkhill. He had a Bengal tiger named Sierra, and he bought her  as a cub. He   d bring her to the clinic on a leash. We vaccinated her,  dewormed her, and worked with her for two or three years, and she was  wonderful. We had some that had mountain lions. Same deal. When they  were young, they were wonderful. Like I said, we   d treat them like anything  else. Just had to be a little bit more careful with them. They had some bears  that we used to work on.  Sierra, she did really well, and her owner really got on the bandwagon about  private ownership. The state, at that time, was starting to try to change the  regulations and ban private ownership of the big cats, and he went down to  the state two or three times and really made big speeches about,    This is  crazy. You should be able to own these.    He was quite a force behind that  program, and when about the time she was about three years old, we had  another client that lives out towards Leach  Oklahoma  that had a bunch of  antelope. My gosh, those things are like a flock of geese. You walk into a  pen, and they   re just like,    Whoosh, whoosh.    They   re wild. Well, my gosh,  18  their little old legs, their bones in their legs are like a pencil. You try to do  anything with them, they   d run into a fence, break legs, break necks. Sad,  horrible thing. Of course, you try to minimize how you handle them, but  they had to be tested, tuberculosis tested. The state requires you to do these  things.  Anyway, we went out and did some T.B. testing, and a couple of them broke  their necks. The owner says,    Well, I got to do something with these.    I  said,    Wait a minute. I know the guy that wants these. He owns a Bengal  tiger.    He called Joe. Told him what the deal was. Joe said,    Oh, yeah,  yeah.    A guy brought those antelope down, I think maybe here at the clinic,  and gave them to Joe. Joe took them down, and he said he grabbed one and  unlatched his gate and kicked his gate open because he was going to throw  this in there with that tiger, like he   d done lots of other things.  She went nuts, and just as he went to throw this antelope (you know, they   re  not very big), he went to throw this antelope in that pen, she attacked and  wrapped around him and this antelope and was eating on this antelope and  scratching him in the process. He said he finally got loose, and she was just  going wild. He got the gate. It was open to the outside, but he got around  behind the gate in the pen and had the gate between him and this tiger. He  said,    Finally she took the antelope and went and jumped in her pool,    they  had a swimming pool for her, and jumped in her swimming pool, and he got  out.  Scared him to death, and she started cycling about that time, coming into  heat. She changed completely. He used to lead her around. I had a picture of  her, leading her on a leash. When she got a little bit bigger, we would treat  her, but we would put two leashes on her. That way, we kind of had a little  bit more control on her. He ended up giving her to some park because see,  most parks won   t take them. After they   ve been raised by a human, they   re  not scared of people. They won   t run from people. They   re more likely to  attack a person if they   re not afraid of them. Anyway, most parks won   t take  them. He finally found a park to take them, and he made a 180-degree turn.  After that, he was then on the bandwagon, spokesperson for you shouldn   t  have private ownership of these things.  She scared him so badly that he completely changed his mind, completely.  About that time, the state really changed their regulations on those. You  couldn   t have private ownership of those. You had to have your license as a  rehabilitator or a breeder. They made it a lot more strict, and they should  have. I think that was a good call because there were several of them that  had these bigger cats in very minimal restricted areas.  I remember we did a C-section on a cougar, and they brought her in a little  old cage. I couldn   t get a hold of her. We ended up letting her out on leashes  19  so I could give her a shot so we could do a C-section. That owner was  telling me, he said,    You   re crazy. You   re crazy,    but we had to get to her.  There was several people that had them and just had them in little enclosures  that didn   t amount to anything. I think it   s a good thing. Don   t do all that  many exotics. We do birds. We do a few birds. If there   s anything  tremendously wrong with a reptile, we usually refer those to Dr. Welch over  at Forest Trails  Animal Hospital  in Tulsa. We do a little exotic, but mostly  routine medicine.  Nykolaiszyn You mentioned you spent some time in Africa working. Can you talk a little  bit about   ?  Fleming Oh my gosh. How many hours do you have? You better have lots of time if  you want to hear about Africa   Nykolaiszyn How did you get overseas?  Fleming Well, see, I   m in the Army Reserve. I had gotten out, whenever I graduated  from veterinary school, and then after September 11, I felt like, that I should  do something. I went ahead and obtained or got awarded a direct  commission in the veterinary service of the Army because I felt like I could  help. In 2004, I got notified that I was going to be called up for active duty.  Initially, we were supposed to go to Iraq, and only two weeks before I was  supposed to leave, they changed the whole deal and said,    You   re going to  Africa.    I thought,    What in the world does the Army do in Africa?    I didn   t  even know we had a mission in Africa.  Ended up we had a mission there in the Horn of Africa that was out of  Djibouti, and we did treatment, veterinary work, and human work, in  Ethiopia, Djibouti, Kenya. My gosh, I can   t remember them all now, can I?  Ethiopia, Kenya, Djibouti, walked right along the edge of Somalia, and then  Yemen. We did work in Yemen as well. That   s how I got assigned over  there, and my gosh, tremendous experience. I   m glad I went. It was, of  course, hard on the practice. Since I knew that it was coming, I hired two  veterinarians to take my place while I was gone. I tried to have everything  taken care of as much as possible.  When we flew in to Djibouti, I don   t know if you   ve ever had the  opportunity to have been to Africa. It   s right on the east coast, right on the  very tip of the boot hill that they call it. When we got out of the airplane  there at the airstrip, there   s a dump on the south end of that airstrip where  they burn all their trash and everything. Well, the wind was blowing that  smoke over the airstrip. This was in the end of August, and it was at just  right at dark. It was a hundred degrees, if not hotter. We got out of the  airplane. Here   s this thick smoke going over the airstrip and everything. One  guy looks, and    Oh my God, we   ve went to Hell.    (Laughter)  20  I lived in a tent for a year. I was in Djibouti two days, and then we went to  Ethiopia. We went to an area called Gode, Ethiopia. It   s in the southeastern  corner of Ethiopia, and you   ve never been to a place like this. We stayed in  what they called a hotel, which was an old compound that had, I think it was  seven rooms, made like an L. In the corner was where you   re supposed to  eat, but it wasn   t a hotel. It was just some walls, basically, with half-roofs.  The rooms were all open to the outside, and oh my gosh, it was just filthy.  We got there just about dark. I said,    I   ve only been in Africa two days.     Get on an airplane, and we fly to this little airstrip in Gode.  They bus us out to this little hotel, and I couldn   t sleep. You could hear all  the noises and no lights. Of course there   s no electricity. About two thirty, I  woke up, and I walked out to the fence. There was a boundary fence around  this place. I walked out to the fence. Just stood there just to see. Little bit  before daylight, the camels, animals started going out with herds. They  started taking the animals this way. They were almost going east. They were  heading out, and then it just got a little bit lighter. I could see the people  kind of come out to the road, and I was trying to figure out what they were  doing. After I watched it, I finally realized what they were doing. They don   t  have outhouses. They don   t have latrines. They get up out of their huts, and  they would come to the road. That   s where they would relieve their selves,  and I understood what I was smelling because it stunk.  This place, it   s just amazing. We had the opportunity to sit and meet with a  village elder, and there   s no water. This place has no water. It sits on top of  a red dirt mound kind of like Stillwater, you know, the red dirt. Not devoid,  but it was completely devoid of vegetation. They had overgrazed it so much  that the only thing left growing was these certain type of milkweeds sticking  up all over the place. They   d take the animals out, and they   d go at least  thirteen to eighteen kilometers in one direction trying to find something to  eat. They   d take the animals out at daylight.  Well, the water for this place came from, there   s a river about two miles  away that was mud, just basically flowing mud. That   s where they got their  water. They had a donkey system set up. This was the craziest thing. These  donkeys, they had a little cart that they hooked up behind them. It had a  barrel, laying out on this barrel. No one was with them. These donkeys  would walk two miles, follow this path two miles. There was kids at the  river, and they would stand in the river, which had crocodiles in it. I   ve got a  picture of a crocodile in this river. These kids would stand in these rivers  with buckets, and they would fill these barrels up. Then these donkeys  would make that trip back, and they had cisterns. They   d dump this water,  muddy water, in these cisterns, and them donkeys, that   s what they did all  day long. They   d just make that trip. Anyway, their water was this muddy  21  water, and by the evening of the first full day that we was there, I had  dysentery.  Nykolaiszyn Oh no   Fleming I thought I was going to die. I   m serious. I laid there. We had no backup, no  airflow, anything. I was stuck in Gode, Ethiopia, and I had this horrible  dysentery in this very filthy setting. I actually thought,    Oh my gosh. I   ve  traveled halfway around the world, and I   m going to die within forty-eight  hours from dysentery,    because I thought I was going to die. We didn   t have  a doctor. We had a physician assistant with us, and you know, he gave me  Ciprofloxacin and Loperomide. That   s all we had, and we had IV fluids, that  type of stuff. It took me forty-eight hours to get over that. For the first three  days, I   m just stuck right there, and I just can   t explain to you how filthy it  was.  When I finally got over it enough that I could crawl basically around that  compound, I thought,    I   m going to find out what got me    because we had  packaged food. We had our MRE   s  Meals Ready to Eat . We had brought  our bottled water. I hadn   t handled anything. Going from here to over there,  you wash your hands. You carry a bottle of the hand sanitizer with you, and  you use it like crazy. I had drank a glass of tea. What I found out, I   d sit and  watch this gal that they had hired to cook, and she was a native. Couldn   t  speak a word of English. I got to watching her when she was washing the  breakfast.  The day that I finally got to where I could walk, they   d eaten breakfast. I  hadn   t eaten anything. (Laughs) I was still trying to sip on water. I watched  her. She had this big pot she had cooked in. They squat. They sit on their  haunches. They don   t sit in chairs really. She squatted down, and she gets  some soapy water and a rag. She washes this pan, but I got to noticing one  whole side of it never leaves the ground. She washes. She turns it. She  washes. She turns it. All the time, one side of this pan   s on the ground. It   s  dirty. When she gets done, she was supposed to be using bottled water to  rinse and cook with. When she gets done, she reaches over, and she gets this  ladle out and pours and rinses, you know. Then I walk over, and I look. It   s  the muddy water from the river.  Then I asked her. I got an interpreter over there. I said,    Okay. What   s going  on here? Show me the water you   re cooking with, and show me the water  that you   re making the tea with.    It was the river water, and she didn   t bring  the tea all the way to a full boil. Tea is what got me. Her and I, we had this  lesson on sanitation and hygiene.    No more of the river water.    Anyway,  like I say, we had an opportunity to meet with the village elder. First thing I  asked him was,    How come you don   t move from here? There   s nothing for  22  the animals to eat. You don   t have any water. It has to come from the river,  and it   s not good water. Why don   t you move?     They live in huts. I mean, literally they just live in huts with thorn bushes  made into a fence around it, and they bring their animals in. Some of the  goats come into the hut. People, the goats, everybody lives in the hut. I  asked,    Why don   t you move?    and he said,    You don   t understand    to an  interpreter.    This is my father   s, father   s, father   s hut. We have been here  forever, and this is our home. We can   t.    I told him,    You can   t exist  without aid.    Catholic charities, lots of people, organizations donate wheat,  oats, rice, whatever. That   s what they survive on. They milk their animals.  They eat one meal a day. They milk the camels. They milk the goats. They  mix it with the rice and the wheat and all that and cook all that. They eat one  meal, big meal a day. That   s lunch. The rest of the time, they drink goat   s  milk, unpasteurized goat   s milk, camel   s milk, and they survive on nothing,  absolutely nothing. They wouldn   t even entertain the thought of moving.  Most of us would think about,    Let   s move. If there   s nothing here, let   s go  somewhere else.    Well, they don   t have anywhere to go. We got to talking  to one of the government representatives, and they had tried moving some of  these tribes. It always caused a war because they said,    You don   t  understand.     About fifty miles to the west was a low mountain range, and the range kind  of came to that because of the topographic features and rise. Rising air gets  hot, and then when it rains, squeezes the water out of it when it cools off.  There was a place about fifty miles to the west where basically the grass  really started. I asked him,    Why can   t you move them over there  somewhere?       Well, that belongs to another tribe.    If you take people from  one tribe and you move them to an area of another tribe, there   s going to be  a killing. It just doesn   t work that way. Their system is actually more  inflexible than I would ever thought, but you can   t mix people from  different tribes. It was very sad.  We did some veterinary treatment sessions there. Had a physician assistant.  We had some nurses. They did some human treatments and stuff, and they   d  bring them little old babies up there. You couldn   t help them really. You   re  not set up as a critical care station. We   d only provide basic care, you know,  polio vaccines, antibiotics, lancing abscesses, those type of things. The UN  and WHO, they publish a bunch of data that says 13 percent infant mortality  rate in those areas and stuff. No, it   s more like 50 percent there in that  particular village. Just horrible.  The most unsanitary conditions you have ever, ever seen. You can get a cut  on your finger doing something, get a cut on your finger. Within twelve  hours, your finger   s that big around, swollen, red, infected, because there is  23  so much human waste in the soil. They don   t have latrines. They don   t have  outhouses. It   s dry. That stool breaks down, gets down with the sand. Wind  blows. It aerosolizes. It blows it everywhere. You   ve got all this bacteria,  high in bacteria content in that soil. You get a cut, boom, just like that. That,  to me, had a tremendous effect on me just going around in Africa and  especially going to Gode.  Right off the bat, I had never witnessed that level of poverty, that level of  filth, lack of sanitation, and seeing people living in it day to day to day to  day. Their water   I   ve got some photographs. We did some more treatment  sessions in Kenya. We went to a place called Wajir. We flew into Wajir. We  had five treatment sessions set up. I   d go set up these treatment sessions. Me  and two other guys, we   d go fly around the country and drive out in these  rented vehicles and meet these people.  To me, that was a true   you know, I   ll get into that in just a minute. I   m  talking about the water first. Anyway, we went and set these treatment  sessions up, and this certain part of Kenya, what they basically had is ponds  to drink out of. That   s where they had their water catch up in these ponds.  You know how dirty a pond looks. Well, we were in this one village   I  believe it was Osawai or something like that. They had brought in about a  herd of two hundred goats, and me and another guy, we went over there and  was treating abscesses and deworming all these goats. I   d locked my  cameras and stuff up in a case before I went over there.  We turned around and started back, and we   re walking towards this pond. It  was really interesting. They   d bring the camels up, and the camels had to get  down on their knees and drink because they didn   t want them in the water.  The cows, they kept the cows way back trying to get them just to water, but  the donkeys and the goats, they just kind of pile in this water. Anyway,  we   re walking back towards this pond.    Tank    is what they call them. Same  thing in Texas, I guess. This guy, he   s bathing. He   s washing his arms and  washing his face, and he   s standing knee deep in this water. Then he reaches  down. He gets a double handful of water, and he brings it up. He   s drinking.  Of course it   s running between his fingers, and it   s just as green as green can  be, about as green as that cap, just as green as green can be. I   m watching  him. He does it two or three times, and I looked at that guy that was with  me. I said,    You and I drink that, we would be dead tomorrow.    We can   t  handle that level of bacteria, but that   s the water they survive on.  Another example about the water, we were in Djibouti, the country of  Djibouti. We   re up in the northwest corner, and we were looking for places  to treat animals and water, where they water them. Best place in the world  because they all have to come to water. That   s the best place to meet them,  best place to do your treatment sessions. We came up on another one of  these tanks, ponds. You guys are young. You probably don   t remember.  24  Clint Eastwood used to make these old movies, High Plains Drifter. Have  you ever seen any one of those? You   ve probably never seen one, have you?  (Laughter) Basically, what it amounts to, when they start that movie, those  movies, somewhere off in the distance, you   re looking in a desert. You can  see these heat waves, and like a mirage, something comes and appears out of  the desert.  Anyway, we   re at this tank, and it   s down a long ways. That water   s nasty.  There   s a little ravine that runs back off of this pond and heads off to the  northwest, and there was three of us standing there. I had an interpreter and  another guy with me, and we were staring and looking. I   m looking at this  ravine, and I got to noticing some white spots.    What in the world is that?     It   s sand, mainly all sand, some scrub brush. I finally walk up to one, and I  kicked some of that sand off. It   s a carcass. It   s a dead goat. I thought,     Well, my gosh. Wonder what happened here?    I got to looking.    Well,  what   s that?    I counted about a quarter of a mile up this ravine. I counted a  hundred carcasses. I thought,    Oh my gosh. I don   t know what   s in this  water, but it must be bad.    About that time of trying to look and like in one  of those old Clint Eastwood movies, I could see something. All the ladies  there, they all wear robes, and they   re very colorful, the brightest orange, the  brightest reds. I could see a color. We just stood there and watched. Pretty  soon, here come these three African gals, and they   re all carrying these five-gallon  water jugs. They look like gas cans. World Health, all over Africa,  they give them away free. They   re all over Africa. They   re yellow cans,  plastic cans with red lids.  Here these gals come carrying their water jugs. I   m excited. They get up  here, and all three of them, they line up. They start getting their water. I get  that interpreter over there, and I, you know, introduce us, tell who we are  and all that kind of stuff. The first question, I said,    My gosh, do you guys  drink this water?    and they all three kind of turn around and look at me at  the same time like,    Well, he   s an idiot    kind of a look. They tell him,    Of  course we drink this water.    My next question is,    My gosh, does it make  you sick? Do you have diarrhea?    He asked them. They   d tell him they  don   t give it to the children because it burns their throat, makes their tongue  swell up, gives them diarrhea, but the adults drink it.  Here I am, na  ve white guy. The next question is,    My gosh, why do you  drink it?    Well, they all the same thing. They all three turn around and look  at me again like,    Boy, he   s special.    (Laughter) Their answer was it   s the  only water they had  It was the only water within twenty-five miles. They  had to drink it. I just thought it was incredible. I took some samples of it, but  where we were at, it was two weeks before I could even get them to where I  can send them on an airplane. Well, they couldn   t grow anything out of it.  Best they could tell was salt, saline. Well, high salt content will kill an  animal. It makes their brain swell. I don   t know if it was just because it was  25  salt or if there was something else in it, but that   s all the water these people  had. It was killing these animals. That   s how bad it was, and that   s what  they face is the water.  That goes in the next story. I asked you how much time you had. That goes  into my next story. We were in the central part of Ethiopia, and we went to  this village called  inaudible . There   s an old rail line that the British built  over a hundred years ago between Djibouti, which is on the coast, and   Addis Ababa , which is the capital of Ethiopia, and that   s what they used  for commerce. The old rail line is still there, and this thing has got the most  dilapidated engine and cars. They   re just beat. They look like crumpled  aluminum cans, and the truckers blow up the track every few days because  the truck drivers, they want the business. They don   t want the train carrying  anything. It   s an interesting story. On the halfway point of this railroad  track, when they built it, they drilled a well, and they hit good water. Well,  this village sprung up around this wellhead.  There was some Army guys in a civil affairs unit. I can   t even speak. They  wanted us to do a treatment session around Dire Dawa, which is the second  largest city in Ethiopia. We went and looked at it and said,    It   s too big.  We   re a small unit.    There was twelve people on our medical team. My  interpreter, his name was Elisha. Girl   s name, but he was a guy, wonderful  guy. He even told me,    There   s too many people here. You won   t be able to  control them. They   re good folks, but they don   t like standing in line.  Everybody wants to be first when you start handing things out.    It   s difficult  to control the level of excitement there, and when you   re handing out  medicine, they all want medicine. He said,    You won   t be able to control  this.     We come up with an alternative, which was this village of  inaudible . It  took us three hours to drive to this village. I mean, it   s bump, bump down a  river, dry riverbed and everything to get to this place. When we got out, the  first thing I noticed was these people were clean. I had the physician, Gus  Randles, with me, and we got out. First thing out, I poked him. I said,    Look  at these folks. They   re clean.    Their dresses were all bright, clean. The kids,  the Africans are very touchy people. They want to touch. They want to hold  you. When they stand next to you, they don   t stand next to you. They lean  against you. I mean, that   s just the way those folks are.  Everywhere you go, when you get out, they want to come and touch you.  One village, we were the first white people they   d seen in twelve years. The  little kids would just come up. They   d just grab ahold of you.    Oh my gosh.  A white guy     They don   t ever get to see one. Anyway, this particular  village, and all the kids run up there. First thing you   re getting to noticing is  they all had a full head of hair. They didn   t have ringworm. They didn   t  have scabies. That   s prevalent over there just because of sanitation. These  26  kids are all clean. I   m sitting there.    Something really unusual going on  here.     The village elder, in that case, was a woman. It was the only one we went to  that the village elder was a woman. She said she was a hundred years old.  She looked like it. We sat down and had a talk with her. You went through  the interpreter. I asked, I said,    Okay. Your people are very clean. They look  very healthy. Your children are clean and healthy. What   s going on? How is  this so?    She told us, she said,    Way back a long time ago, the train stopped,  and a nun got off the train. She decided to live with us. She lived with us.  Oh, she was mean, but she made us wash and made us clean and showed us  how to wash and how to clean. We have good water and plenty of water.    I  don   t know how long the nun stayed. They could not remember the nun   s  name, but she must   ve been tough because those folks, it was very  interesting.  They had these water troughs, good water. They   d fill these water troughs  up, and the watering of the livestock is very orchestrated. You just don   t  picture, you know, when you think about the middle of nowhere, no  electricity, no education, you wouldn   t think about how organized they are,  but it   s by family, by tribe. They have certain times they get to rotate in,  water their animals, rotate out, and there   s no gray area. I mean, you   ve only  got a certain amount of time, and it moves quickly.  These gals (that   s who does most of the herding is the gals), they   d bring  these little flocks of sheep and goats and stuff in, camels. They   d bring them  in, but the first thing they   d do is they   d grab these kids by the ear. They   d  throw them in these water troughs, and they   d wash these kids up. Then they  had an area set up where they   d go behind a curtain and clean up, and some  of them had taken to the extreme. They   d wash these goats. They had a lot  of water, and they   d wash these goats and stuff. It was incredible because it  was the healthiest. We treated sixty-three thousand animals in that year we  were there and twelve thousand people, but that one village was the  healthiest people, the healthiest animals.  Granted, it was a lot of because they had good, clean water, which was rare,  but also that one person, that nun had taken the time to teach these people  sanitation and hygiene. I don   t know how she did it, but she did it in such a  way that they were still scared of her because they still did it. (Laughter) It  made all the difference in the world. That has also had a very lasting  impression on me. One person can make a very big difference, can last a  long time, even in the middle of nowhere, and that   s the truth.  Anyway, we traveled, like I said, several places all over the country. We met  a lot of good people. We went to OSU   s sister school, Ulma. Remember  that? Can you remember that? Can you pronounce it? It   s in Ethiopia. It   s  27  west of Dire Dawa, Ulma, U-L-M-A   I can   t pronounce it. We went over  there, and we were actually over there. Dr. Wagoner retired from OSU  Animal Science, nutritionist. He was actually there when I was there. He  was in the same hotel. I didn   t even know it. I would   ve introduced myself  to him. He had been there when they set that university up and had went  back for a visit, and I happened to be there. I missed a heck of an  opportunity to meet up with him.  We had went to that old university, and an interesting thing of, away from  that old Ag university, they took a whole bunch of tractors and plows and  stuff over there. That was part of that program, and they showed them how  to use them and all that kind of stuff. You   ll find those old tractors and  bulldozers abandoned all over the place. They drove them until they broke  down, and then they stripped them. The blocks and everything are still  sitting there. It   s so dry it doesn   t rust. I mean, it rusts, but it doesn   t rust  away. That   s been fifty years ago or forty years ago, whatever how long.  You   ll find them out in the middle of nowhere. You   ll be driving along, and  you   ll run across one of those little bulldozers out in the middle of nowhere  that was part of that program. They just left them. That   s kind of the  philosophy there. You use it until it breaks down. Then they strip it, and  that   s it. It   s quite interesting, very, very interesting.  Yes, I can keep talking for hours about Africa. Everybody should go, and  I   m telling you for sure. Everybody needs to go to Africa. The people there  are, the majority of the people are wonderful. They   re bright. My gosh, they  can move. It   s amazing. You know that they could change the world if they  had the opportunity, but most of them will never have the opportunity.  They can go to school. Some of them will get programs where they can  come to the United States and everything else, but when they go back,  there   s no jobs. There   s nothing for them to do. The main reason for that is  because of stability. Africa   s unstable, and whoever   s in charge today may  not be there tomorrow. Because of that, you can   t build towards a future.  Why do you have a savings account? You have a savings account because  you   re planning for the future. If you put in a small business, you   re putting  that business in hopes that you can make a return on your income in the  future, that you   ll have something there that can take care of you, supply  you income. Well, when everything   s so unstable that every little bit they  have a breakdown in the system, you can   t plan forward. You can   t plan  forward. That lack of stability, I think, has a lot to do with what   s wrong  with Africa.  We also got to go to Yemen, and we were the first team in Yemen since  1981. Yemen is a whole, completely different culture than Africa. Of  course, in the eastern part of Africa, east part of Ethiopia, they   re Muslims  28  as well. Yemen, of course, the majority of the people there are Muslims, and  I got to working with their Department of Agriculture. I   ve went back now  four times to Yemen. I was last there two years ago in August.  Once again, talking about people, most of the people in Yemen are good  people. They are just like everybody else. They   re trying to make a living,  trying to take care of their families, all those type of things. They   re not out  to get every infidel. I have some very good friends in Yemen, a veterinarian  that I   ve met and worked with. My gosh, I   ve had meetings there where I   ve  sat with their minister of agriculture, their director of their veterinary  quarantine operation. Wonderful conversations with those gentlemen, and  they   re very, very good people. They want to do good for their country, but  once again, you   ve got that tremendous stability problem and poverty like  you just can   t imagine.  Those people live every day in a level of poverty that, you know, there are  some areas in the United States where there is some poverty, but I have yet  to see anything that would equal the level of poverty that   s present in  Yemen. Not just Yemen. Africa as well. Right now, I feel for them. They   re  getting bombarded like crazy. I   ve sent emails to some of the veterinarians  that I worked with over there. Haven   t had any response at all. They asked  me to help design their quarantine, their main quarantine for the country. I  went over there several times designing this quarantine and got to go back  over and see it get started. I have no idea what kind of shape it   s in now. I  invested an awful lot of time in that agricultural program, and I   d like to see  them do well. All that, of course, because my veterinary degree and my  knowledge as far as large animals. Once again, that   s where your large  animal part pays off. That was a tremendous experience, getting to go over  there and working with their agriculture sector.  It   s amazing here in the United States, so many things that you take for  granted are disease control. We have a very, very strong USDA, and they  work very hard on controlling entry of disease in the United States and  outbreaks of disease. Over there, disease is so rampant, and there   s so little  control over disease that it   s, the contrast is almost mindboggling. You can   t  perceive it. That   s why talking about going to Africa, going to places like  Yemen, I think everybody in the United States ought to go somewhere like  that, and it helps you appreciate what we have.  Just to be born in the United States is a blessing beyond measure because  you   re born into a situation where even if you   re poor, horribly poor, you  still have the opportunity to improve yourself and to bust out of that social  setting, economic setting, and excel. My gosh, read the newspaper. You read  lots of stories. They don   t have that opportunity over there. Their poverty is  so extreme, their level of opportunities to advance. I   ll give you a pretty  good example in Yemen on the jobs. Say I want a job. I   ve got two choices.  29  Either I go do whatever the family business is. If the father is a jeweler,  okay, I go as an apprentice and do the family business, or I have to go pay  someone to give me a job. Then I have to pay them out of the paycheck.  Every time you get a paycheck, you have to pay them for that job. They get  very little money. Those are the only two opportunities you have. There   s no  other opportunity there, none for those folks, and that   s what they   re faced  with every day.  For the women, there is no job. They   re only allowed to go to school until  they   re in the eighth grade, and then they   re supposed to get married and  have children.    Seven camels,    you   re worth seven camels. That   s the whole  deal of the dowry. The dad wants lots of daughters. He wants sons, of  course, so they can work. Lots of daughters because the daughters are worth  seven camels. I mean, that   s the deal  That   s just the way it is. It   s hard to  escape from that, but that   s their culture also. A lot of them don   t want to  escape from that.  We had the opportunity to talk to several of the Yemeni while we were  doing our treatment session, you know, asking the women,    How would you  like to   would you change at all?    A lot of them don   t want to change.  They don   t want western style. They don   t want western way of life. They  perceive it to be not good, not good for the family. That   s something that I  think we also fail to appreciate. Their family values are very, very, very  strong. Their family unit is very strong. It   s the grandmother, okay, the  matriarch who says whether they have to wear the full hijab, the face piece  or not. It   s not the man. Everybody has this perception,    It   s those dang  men.    Granted, they   re a large part of the problem, okay?  Nykolaiszyn Yes, yes.  Fleming Don   t misunderstand me, not one bit, but it   s very interesting. The full hijab,  the gloves, the matriarch says whether they have to wear those or not. The  mother, okay, she   s the one that picks the bride. The guy doesn   t pick the  bride. The mother picks the bride. They have pretty good control over what  little they have to control. They   re not really interested in changing that. It   s  because it   s cultural. It   s traditional. For them, their religion is not separate  from the   I   ve got a good picture. We went to a school. This was a middle  school. They had finished the first floor, but they had never finished the  second. These kids were crammed in there like sardines. There was fifty  girls in a classroom this size. I   m serious. I mean, they were just crammed.  They were just crammed in there because they didn   t have enough money to  finish the second floor. The ambassador for Yemen, he   s the one that  eventually got the funding to finish this second floor. Anyway, the Army  didn   t have enough money.  30  The Army has so much money to use on these projects, but it   s pretty  limited. Of course, the state department has a lot more money than the Army  does. Anyway, we were walking through this classroom, and I   ve got a  picture of the map of the world for these Yemeni students. The map of the  world for these Yemeni students is basically the east coast of the United  States to about the west side of China, mainly the Middle East. The only  countries that are colored, the only countries they really teach are the  Muslim countries. That   s at that level.  They start them very young, and it   s because their religion is not separate  from their daily lives. Their religion is not separate from their government.  Their judges are not law, legal judges. They   re actually religious judges.  They make their decrees and their judgements based on religious law. It  permeates every sector of their life. Because of that, you can   t hardly  separate, say, in Yemen, how the businesses run, how their government  agencies work. You can   t separate it from the religious side of things  because it   s the basis for everything.  The women, you look at most religions, okay. Who   s the strongest members  of most religions? Who really keeps that religion going? It   s the women,  okay? I don   t mean that derogatory or anything. That   s just the way it is, and  it   s the same way for them. They   re the ones that really enforce an awful lot  of that. It   s complex. It   s not as easy as just saying,    Get out of that mess,     you know, because it   s their lifestyle. Like I said, I   ve had some  conversations with some very knowledgeable people, much, much more  knowledgeable than I, about how to change that structure and change their  lifestyle. You know what? I don   t have any answers. I have lots of  questions. I have lots and lots of questions because they need help. I mean,  we have problems, too, okay?  Nykolaiszyn Oh yeah. We do.  Fleming Our large cities are more violent. I was all over Yemen. I was told later I  wasn   t supposed to go all over Yemen, but I was all over Yemen. I never  once felt like I was in deathly danger. I was in some situations I probably  shouldn   t have been in, but nothing horrific. There   s some of our larger  cities I would not dare to go in the central part or certain parts of those  cities, so we have lots of problems here.  Nykolaiszyn Well, it seems like it was a good, eye-opening trip for you.  Fleming Oh my gosh, yes  It changed my life. Beyond a shadow of doubt, yeah, it  changed my life. I feel like it made me a better person, at least definitely  much more aware of the adversities that a lot of people have to face  compared to us. Yes, I think everybody ought to go. Ought to be mandatory  for college students. Absolutely ought to be mandatory.  31  Nykolaiszyn You kind of touched upon this earlier in the interview about changes here in  Locust Grove.  Fleming Oh yes.  Nykolaiszyn Could you talk a little bit about changes through the years? You know,  you   ve grown up here. You   ve returned here.  Fleming You bet. This, of course, is very rural, very slow-paced. You   re talking  about comparing to Florida. Very, very slow-paced, but probably the main  way to measure that is conveniences. As an area becomes more modernized,  more urbanized, you start getting more conveniences. I can remember a time  when there was one bank, and that bank closed at two o   clock in the  afternoon. On Saturdays, it was open from eight to twelve. There was no  ATMs or anything else. If you didn   t get your cash during the main part of  the day, you   re out of luck. You   re out of luck, and the same way for  holidays or anything else. No ATMs. One of the biggest conveniences, of  course, was when Locust finally got its first ATM, which wasn   t until the     90s, in the mid-   90s or something before it got its first ATM, and food,  choices for food.  Now we have a Neighborhood Market, which is a tremendous convenience.  Nothing against Harp   s, which is a wonderful group in their selves, but of  course everybody likes choice. Another thing is the roads. We talk about  that in college. Especially in history, in economics, farm-to-market roads,  farm-to-market transportation. As a country, that   s one of the things that  we   ve been able, really the only reason we   ve been able to excel is our  farmers can produce a wonderful product but they also have the ability to  get it to market. A lot of countries, that   s a difficult, difficult thing. When I  was in Yemen, I did a livestock study all over the country. That   s how I  ended up going all over the country, and a lot of those farmers had no way  of getting their livestock to market. They end up selling to this local guy that  has a truck. He has a way of transporting. He gives them nothing.  They don   t get much, but they also don   t get any market information. They  don   t even know what the market is in the main city two hundred miles  away. They don   t know what the market is. They sell it to this local guy for  almost nothing. He hauls it. He sells it to another guy. Just like here, except  the difference is our farmers are informed. They know what the market is.  They   re not going to let this rascal give them nothing. Here   s the same way.  Most of the roads around here used to be gravel. My gosh, you   d have flats  all the time and everything else. Now they   re mostly paved. You get  somewhere much more quickly, and you don   t have to worry about your  tires going flat.  32  Internet   s the same way. At first, everybody had satellite internet, you know,  Hughes Net, Blue-something. I don   t remember what it was. That was the  only way you   d get internet, and then the phone company, thank goodness,  through technology and advancements, started carrying it so you could get  rid of the satellite, and you finally could get on the internet, which took quite  a while, actually, to be able to get on the internet and then be able to get  high-rate speed. That took quite a while. That was awfully nice to see that  come in. I know Anissa at the library has talked about that. She finally got  her T-1 feed in. Now all of her patrons can, several of them can get on  computers at the same time. For a long time, if over three of them got on a  computer at one time, it would just crawl. You bet. Technology had been  wonderful, the roads, finance, groceries. Those are probably the main things,  I guess, that   s changed over time. I guess that would be the main things.  Nykolaiszyn How do you remain connected to Oklahoma State these days?  Fleming What I mainly do is I go down for the continuing education classes, and we  refer patients to the University for certain reasons, some ophthalmology  cases. Horses, sometimes, we   ll refer down there. Because of that, we   ve got  a pretty open dialogue with the University and the veterinary staff, lay staff,  as well. Like I said, I normally go down at least once a year, go down and do  some of the continuing education. I do continuing education all over the  place, but I will go down there usually once a year specifically just so I can  see some of the veterinarians and connect and reconnect with some of the  folks down there. I haven   t went on the tour of the veterinary school lately. I  used to do those, but I haven   t been on a tour of the veterinary school lately.  Nykolaiszyn Give them a couple months. They   re building that new addition to the  hospital.  Fleming That   s what I hear. I   m going to have to go there and go through that, see  what that looks that. Those are the two main ways I stay connected with the  university.  Nykolaiszyn Looking back on your career and your path to OSU and everything you   ve  done after graduation, how did earning your degrees from the University  impact your life?  Fleming Well, kind of like the trip to Africa, it changed my life completely. I   m from  a small town. I didn   t have much knowledge of the world or anything else.  This was pretty well all I had knowledge of. The main thing, I think, that  what it does is it expands your ability to learn, expands your knowledge  base, and by doing that, it gives you the tools to take advantage of what  opportunities come, that might present their selves. You have no idea what  those will be. My knowledge that I gained and in your social skills that you  gain while you   re in school allowed me to interact. Like I said, I   ve worked  33  with some ministers of agriculture and everything else, and I   m just a little  old guy from Locust Grove. All that was made possible, really, by my  education from OSU. I   m deeply indebted to the opportunities that going to  college gave me.  Got in trouble one time. I used to do, and I still do some, career days for  these high schools. I actually was over at Chouteau. You know, there   s a  large Amish community there, and I said,    Everybody should go to college.  There   s no reason why everybody doesn   t make it their goal to go to  college.    They asked me not to come back. (Laughter) I believe that. Even  with folks like the Amish community, highly traditional community, very  good people. I meant nothing derogatory to them at all because I think the  world of them. Even though it   s their tradition not to go to college, they   re  all involved in agriculture in some way or another. They could learn. They  could learn some things that they could take back and not violate their  premise but help with newer techniques of agriculture, different ways of  doing things.  I actually still believe that everybody can benefit from college, from  attaining a college degree. Not everybody   s going to use it. Some people  may rather just do a technical level job, plumbing or whatever, but they   ll  still use some of the knowledge they   ve gained in college, whether they like  it or not. I think everybody should go. I truly believe that. It   s opened up my  world to all kinds of opportunities, and I don   t see any reason why it can   t  do the same for just about everybody.  Nykolaiszyn As we kind of wind down our interview today, tell me a little bit about your  family, your children.  Fleming I only have the one son, John. He did go to OSU. He didn   t graduate from  there. He ended up coming home. He graduated from NSU. That   s where he  ended up graduating. A former wife, I guess, to say that correctly, she ended  up working for the University, and she actually got her law degree from TU.  She worked, just up to the last year or so, she actually went to work for the  State of Oklahoma. We   ve all been associated with OSU one way or  another. John now, my son, is married to a very nice lady that had three  children. Now between the two of them, they have six children. We try to  take them to Branson and everywhere else. We enjoy that immensely, of  course. Grandchildren are wonderful. You can take and spoil them rotten  and then send them home. It   s not my job to train them to be good citizens.  That   s their parents    job. My job is to have fun with them. We run the farm  and run the practice and mess with the grandchildren is what we do more  than anything else.  Nykolaiszyn Well, great. Is there anything else you   d like to hit upon, touch upon, before  we close on out today?  34  Fleming No, I think we   ve done a pretty good job of covering it. Just, Go Pokes   That   s the main thing, I guess.  Nykolaiszyn Well, Dr. Fleming, thank you so much for taking time out of your day to  meet with us.  Fleming Well, you   re welcome. I enjoyed it. Like I say, I can talk for hours,  especially about Africa.  -------  -------
