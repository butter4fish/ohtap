ELIZABETH JONES:  Okay this is Elizabeth Jones. I&#8217;m in Raleigh, North Carolina. Today is Tuesday July 2nd, 2014, and I&#8217;m at the North Carolina Justice Center with Nicole Dozier who is the assistant director of the North Carolina Justice Center&#8217;s Health Access Coalition and a city councilwoman for the city of Apex, North Carolina. So thanks so much for agreeing to do this interview.  NICOLE DOZIER: You&#8217;re welcome. Thanks for asking.   EJ:  So I just want to start off a little bit about where and when you were born and where you grew up and what it was like.  ND:  Okay, sure. So I grew up in most of my growing up I guess was in North Haven, Connecticut, and my parents decided when their parents got a little bit older to move back south. So they&#8217;re from North Carolina. So we did move to North Carolina when I was beginning middle school. So I lived in eastern North Carolina the rest of my teenage years through my teenage years and then went to UNC-Chapel Hill. So that was my introduction to this area and liked it and decided I wasn&#8217;t going to go back to Connecticut, which is something that I said I would do. I didn&#8217;t understand why we were moving. I understood the grandparents. But I thought it would be a lot different being in North Haven, Connecticut and then rural North Carolina, which it was. But I did enjoy seeing more, learning more about North Carolina and all it has to offer and decided to stay.   EJ:  What was it like growing up in eastern North Carolina and what were the--, what was that transition like?  ND:  Well, for me I guess the part of Connecticut I was in it was not diverse. So moving to rural North Carolina it was a little more diverse. But also being in the suburbs of Connecticut and being in the country, more of the country in North Carolina was different for me but I did understand, I got to appreciate it a lot, got to be around more of my cousins and other family friends in North Carolina in a different way. I missed my first cousins that were in Connecticut, but a lot of my cousins on both sides were in eastern North Carolina. So that was helpful and I guess, things were far apart, spread apart. So if you said, &#8220;Well, I need to get, I don&#8217;t know, a pair of shoes for church tomorrow&#8221;, you better not forget if you needed pantyhose because nobody was going back to the mall again. Whereas in other parts of the state like where we live now, you can go to the mall three or four times if you need to. That was the thing that was a little bit different for me is things being so spread apart. But I learned a lot from being here and the origination of my family and that sort of thing.  EJ:  So is your family extremely close-knit or--?  ND:  I mean we have, I&#8217;m talking about my extended family so as far as my dad and mom grew up about an hour or so apart, but they didn&#8217;t meet until they were in college at Central, NC Central. At the time it was North Carolina College. So I would say yeah, that family is close, and they do, especially my mother&#8217;s family did reunions. And it started a lot of folks were down on my grandmother&#8217;s front porch in Winterville in July, and it was around the Fourth and said, &#8220;Well, let&#8217;s start doing this formally,&#8221; but we&#8217;ve been doing it-- I don&#8217;t remember when it was but we&#8217;ve been doing this about every two years since then, for many years. And we share the history of our family from the free slave Jerry and Elvira and the history there their son Caleb, to each branch of the tree. And so it&#8217;s neat to get together and see the different branches and how people were renamed like my grandfather was Robert, and he was named after an uncle. And so moving back here got me more connected to some of that. My father&#8217;s family does not do reunions, but he had a pretty huge family. So we did in growing up when I was younger was had the traditional dinner on Sunday at your grandma&#8217;s. So that was something that was really fun, connecting like that when they were living. My grandparents lived to be a pretty good age, my grandmother&#8217;s to ninety and ninety-nine. So we had them for a long time, at least the grandmothers.   EJ:  What did your grandparents do?  ND:  My maternal grandparents, my grandfather is interesting. His father actually started a dry cleaners. So in 1800s he had, it was called a pressing club. I don&#8217;t know who came up with that name. So but that&#8217;s what it was called and he did that. So, his children didn&#8217;t work in the fields. And many ethnicities and income levels so he had that. It was the first African American business, I&#8217;m told, in downtown Winterville. And it was the only cleaners. So when I&#8217;ve done a committee meeting at the Warehouse restaurant in Winterville I sent the meeting notice out. And I get the emails from my mother&#8217;s cousins saying, &#8220;This is Hilda,&#8221; I mean, &#8220;This is Hilda&#8217;s daughter and this is Robert, Pearlie&#8217;s granddaughter, and she&#8217;s home grown,&#8221; and so at least they had good reputations as business owners because people identify with them through me. And so that&#8217;s what he, so my grandfather and all the brothers through my understanding and then the older sisters worked in the dry cleaners. And then my grandmother, his wife, she worked in a factory. I&#8217;ve forgotten what it&#8217;s called, but it was related to tobacco. So she did that all that I know, most of her adult life as far as I know. So then they had that business and then she did that. Then my paternal, so my father&#8217;s mother was a domestic and she worked for a family most of the time who owned a dealership. And then my grandfather was a logger, which was pretty decent paying job at that time but very strenuous jobs.   EJ:  So that I want to go back to this close knit family situation. Were y&#8217;all politically active growing up?  ND:  Okay. So I&#8217;m not aware that my grandparents were. It was probably helpful on my mother&#8217;s side that they owned a business that everybody in the community no matter what color you were used it. And one of the ladies who, I spoke to the Association of Retired School Personnel, and there was a Caucasian lady who said I went to the cleaners. So they may have, I don&#8217;t think they were politically active, but they have different relationships probably with people in the community. But my, I don&#8217;t know anything about my father&#8217;s parents being politically active. I&#8217;m told that his grandmother though did not allow white children to call her aunt instead of calling her Mrs. She was like you&#8217;re going to call me this. I&#8217;m an adult. So that was really good. But my parents were essential during the time of civil rights movement. So they were involved in the movement, Dr. Martin Luther King came down one time I&#8217;m told with Floyd McKissick Sr. and some other leaders. And as students they were engaged in civil disobedience about integrating Durham&#8217;s restaurants and businesses, and so I know there was a time my mother spoke about cars coming up, and they were very organized like where you go. And she was going to the Howard Johnson. And she said there were 2,000 folks involved in civil disobedience all around the town, around the city. They did arrest the folks who were involved in that. At Howard Johnson they would just not move out of the parking lot is what they did. So they couldn&#8217;t go into the restaurant, but they stood out there as a sit-in. But they arrested, but they couldn&#8217;t really do anything with 2,000 people. So she talked about people from different ethnicities and faith and different towns that got together and did those things. So Durham was integrated after that. But that what I know about my parents with activism is related to that.   When she would go home on the bus to Winterville, she would go to the white doors and back through them. And she had a friend who got married after high school and didn&#8217;t go to college. So she wasn&#8217;t involved in these civil disobedience acts to be able to eat places and shop places with respect. So she I mean she said, &#8220;Look, we&#8217;re going to go sit down and eat here in this restaurant,&#8221; and her friend was like, &#8220;No we&#8217;re not,&#8221; &#8220;Yes we are.&#8221; So she did and was courageous and someone came from the back and asked her who she was. And you must be a college student and that kind of thing. I believe they got served. I can&#8217;t remember for sure. But those are some of the stories that I remember.   My dad, he worked in the same group up at Central too. And he talked about being in groups where making sure that people who were really high profile in the movement, that their families were okay and being in groups to watch out for that kind of thing.   EJ:  That&#8217;s really interesting. Did your parents pass any of that political drive onto you when you were younger or--?  ND: [M]y parents were very clear and taught me a lot about what things were like for them. And in doing that it makes it clear for like how things are different. So even the fact that they decided to go to college, I asked, &#8220;How did that come up&#8221;. My mom said, &#8220;Well I wanted to, I didn&#8217;t want to work necessarily in the dry cleaners. I wanted to leave home and do something else.&#8221; And so for my dad his family wanted him to go to college. He did very well in school, especially in science and math. So I guess for them it was saying that I can make a difference in my own life and my community if I can be educated. So my dad was pre-med but became a chemist then and ended up going in education, so inspiring other people and their kids, particularly in certain schools he was in, about how education can help them and the opportunity we were given by not having to do this, the fighting that they had to do, the opportunity that we have to do that. So they would say things like that to me and that there&#8217;s no reason why I can&#8217;t do well in a class whether it's science or math and that so those are the things that I recall, and my father saying, &#8220;Did you do your best?&#8221; With report cards, &#8220;Did you do your best?&#8221; And so it was impressed upon me to do my best but making me very aware of the differences they had growing up, especially in the South versus in the North.   So when they moved north in the [19]60s the differences were what he was allowed to make as a chemist in the North. But I remember him speaking about the difference between the people around him in Connecticut versus the people around him in the [19]60s here so even that helped inform me that I was in a predominantly white neighborhood and school. But there was a time in fifth grade where people made it real clear to me, and that&#8217;s probably something that people would not happen in the North but it did.   EJ:  How did that, how did that feel?  ND:  Oh it felt bad. It was a point where the kids were commenting on my skin color on a daily basis for a while in the lunchroom. So I would come home and go to bed, go in my room. So finally they got me to talk about it and what he did was he visited all the parents&#8217; homes and talked to them. So I didn&#8217;t have any problem after that. And actually, that was fifth grade, so a few years after that I go back every summer and stay with cousins, but they actually had a baseball, softball game in my honor so to speak. So all these kids from my fifth grade class where there so that sort of a thing is today, so seeing those kids again and not having any problem with what happened earlier that specific time in fifth grade. That&#8217;s the only time I remember something like that to experience that related to being a different place where you&#8217;re not, where you&#8217;re in a minority in a different place.  EJ:  Do you have any, so you went to Chapel Hill.   ND:  Um hmm.  EJ:  Did you have any experiences of difference at Chapel Hill?  ND:  I had one, well I&#8217;m sure I had (         ), but it&#8217;s been a while now. It&#8217;s been longer than I want to admit. I do remember I had a, I lived in the suites over in Morrison. I had a suitemate who well, that did use the N word in anger with me. But here&#8217;s what it taught me. First of all we had a rule when you come in pretty late lock the suite door. Right. So I came in, the suite door whatever. You&#8217;re young. So I didn&#8217;t close the door. Like I probably slammed it a little bit. So I was about eighteen or so. And then she got angry and said that word. So I went into her room, but I assumed that it was the woman, the suitemate that I didn&#8217;t really talk to me much at all in the suite or to my roommate at the time.  EJ:  So you didn&#8217;t see who said it, you heard.  ND:  I didn&#8217;t see. I heard it. So I made an assumption. So I went in there and told her up and down about what she said and everything. And then but her, it was actually her roommate that was up on the top bunk who was very friendly with me and my roommate who actually said it. Because I went to the resident assistant to get help to talk it out since we had to be there the whole year with each other, and that&#8217;s when I found out. So I learned a lot about making assumptions. I assumed it was a girl that wasn&#8217;t as friendly towards us and she was more my eye level. But it was a girl who was very friendly to us is the one that said it. So it taught me something about making assumptions too.  EJ:  Yeah. Wow.   ND:  But we got okay. We had our meeting and we got okay.   EJ:  That&#8217;s good. That&#8217;s good. So you learn a lot in school and you get involved in all kinds of different things that really come to shape who you are today. So what kinds of things were you involved in on campus?  ND:  Well, I did pledge the public service sorority, Delta Sigma Theta. I did that and because I grew up, my mother pledged Delta at Central. And because I grew up without sisters and my brothers were a lot younger than me. It was one of the things I thought about is this would be neat to be part of this group of positive young predominantly African American women. And it was something my mother did too and on campus&#8212;I thought it was a positive reputation the group had. And the people who were in it at the time I respected a lot and thought they were really bright women. So I did and it&#8217;s still when I look at what these women are doing now. It&#8217;s so great the things that, to be involved in the group some of the things they&#8217;ve done in their lives and what they&#8217;re doing with their professions, very impressive. So I feel honored to be a part of that group when I look at some of the, particularly the women I pledged with -- we call our line sisters -- connecting with them last summer,  seeing what they are doing is really great to be a part of that. So that&#8217;s one of the things I did.   I was a minority, I can&#8217;t think of the proper name, advisor. And I tutored related to French and whatever writing papers kind of thing, I was good at those things. So I did that a little bit.   And then oh there was an organization called, it&#8217;s different now but it&#8217;s called Sweet Carolines. And it was really a group that helped with the recruitment department related to football. So I thought it would be fun to get involved in that. So you drop by the office, do some paperwork, take prospective recruits and their families on tours and talk about the university. So I learned a lot about the history of different places. We&#8217;d take the old well and there is a dorm that the plans are upside down. Doing that with the families and then as you&#8217;re younger you do that. You blow up the balloons, whatever the balloons that the guys run through, a part of like a spirit group for that. So I became in charge of that group when I moved up to being the more senior member there. So those are, I didn&#8217;t do a whole lot of extracurricular things. And I&#8217;m not athletic at all so that was the closest I was going to get to getting any tickets for people to sit in my will call seats was that I be a Sweet Caroline. And that was another way to meet a diverse group of other women who were on campus too.   EJ:  How does being an African American woman shape your experiences today, and also how does that shape your political involvement today?  ND:  I see. Yeah. I guess just the lens that I look through, and it doesn&#8217;t mean always because something is happening to me or to someone that I care about, it doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s always happening. But it&#8217;s the lens that I look through, and I get to look through that lens because of my experiences. So for me because many times in the things that I do it&#8217;s similar to the way I grew up where the room may not be as diverse or the place where I am may not be as diverse. So I have a responsibility in some ways to do my work in a positive way and because it&#8217;s easy for negative feelings or the past to come up and color what you&#8217;re doing. So for me being a woman too and [the] perception is try to make sure that people can see me for me is what I&#8217;ve said recently to people is because I pledged a sorority or because I was a Sweet Caroline or because I&#8217;m from-- my parents are from whatever, eastern north Carolina, or my parents are educators, whatever you think about because I&#8217;m registered as a Democrat. Whatever you think about those things, there&#8217;s not this one size fits all package. And so I&#8217;ve had this conversation with someone recently and they thought that ideologically that we were different because of a perception and that I work at the Justice Center. But I said until you and I really sit down and have a conversation you don&#8217;t know how far apart or how close we are. I don&#8217;t think of myself in these labels when I wake up in the morning, of these other labels. I think of myself more as a Christian, a mother, a wife, a good citizen, trying to be a good citizen of where I live and someone who&#8217;s trying to in my using my profession to help others because I&#8217;m a Christian. It&#8217;s like I can think of it as a ministry when you&#8217;re trying to give people the Good News about stuff. Yeah there might be bad news, but here, there&#8217;s good news here. Here&#8217;s what it is. So that&#8217;s how I would try to approach it is that I see myself as those things first. These other things someone else is thinking about me or making opinions or forming opinions about me at times I guess.  EJ:  How do you think your faith has shaped your career and who you are today?  ND:  Okay. One of the things, it does a lot for me because I think prayer is very important. That&#8217;s a big thing for me and what my family has taught me and the churches that I was allowed to, that I was privileged to grow up in. It&#8217;s about as a child knowing how to pray and being that part of my growing up was to do your homework for an hour and then you need to read the Bible. They didn&#8217;t tell me what to read, how to read, how long to read. So as a Christian child, yeah, I sought to do that. And I think it makes me a better parent. It makes me a better person because it also helps you forgive yourself when you feel like you haven&#8217;t done enough or things that you do that you wouldn&#8217;t have done, you wouldn&#8217;t do again, is the biggest thing is to that God is a forgiving God and to forgive yourself. But also that He empowers me to do things that as Nicole, that&#8217;s nothing I thought I would ever be able to do. In my job there are a lot of facets to it, but the facet of public speaking is something that I never thought that I would ever do. I would never take one communications class. I was actually too afraid to take the class. So that&#8217;s really bad. So that&#8217;s one thing I try to help my kids to never do that, never let fear get the best of them. And never make a decision not to do something, do something because you don&#8217;t have a friend or a buddy to do it with. Be empowered and courageous, unlike I was when I was younger.   So yeah, I would say so my faith allows me to say if this person can do this have this skill or learn how to do it, then why shouldn&#8217;t I be able to? And that&#8217;s what helps me and too and being an advocate, being a person of faith also helps because it&#8217;s helpful to use the faith community in this work. And I don&#8217;t mean use in a bad way, but to join along and partner with the faith community, because if I can&#8217;t reach the person I can maybe reach the pastor. But the person&#8217;s working a twelve hour shift and I drive to a Tier One county, then I might not be able to connect with that person when I&#8217;m there doing outreach and engagement work. But I can definitely try to reach the leaders. So sometimes there are traditional leaders like a pastor who has the stories of the people in his community, in his congregation, wherever he meets people. He can have those stories in his heart and his head and can share them, and then can share what I want to do back. But also the people have risen up as leaders in the community that may be a councilperson like in Marion was a councilperson or like in Stoneville was a pastor. There&#8217;s a chaplain down in Greenville that I connect with. So using, taking my faith and that&#8217;s a comfortable place for me. So when we go to churches, it&#8217;s comfortable to say, &#8220;Okay pastor, this is your house. You want to open up a prayer, how do you want me to do this meeting so it&#8217;s a comfortable place for me?&#8221; Because that&#8217;s where I feel comfortable, in a church.   EJ:  That&#8217;s interesting, that&#8217;s really interesting. And I think it&#8217;s that non-traditional ways of outreach are particularly interesting and wondering if maybe you&#8217;re growing up in that eastern North Carolina, that more rural area if maybe you picked up on some non-traditional ways of communication or outreach that might influence your work at the Justice Center today. So I heard a couple of times you mention your children and your husband, so how did you meet your husband?  ND:  Okay that&#8217;s a really long story so I&#8217;ll try to make it short. Okay. So there was two groups of friends who they are friends of, I knew people in both groups. But my husband only knew someone in one group and so these groups of people thought we would be, it would be good for us to meet. So I do owe that to the lord and to those folks who started this conversation. And after over a year of hearing back and forth things we did meet. And so we&#8217;ve been married nineteen years.  EJ:  Wow. And you have how many children?  ND:  Two children. Yes, just two children. As my son&#8217;s older, my son is fourteen and then my daughter eleven.   EJ:  What roles and expectations do you have for your children and how did your growing up influence?  ND:  Well, if you would ask them, they&#8217;d probably say they have too many rules. But and I was reared fairly strictly having educators and a minister in my home, pretty strict. So for me and my children, like for example I had them looking at a PBS show on Freedom Summer. The other night I said we&#8217;re going to look at the first hour at least. But I want them to behave in a way that&#8217;s becoming of someone who wants to do anything in life that they want to do and not have those things hold them back. So as we&#8217;re young we made decision sometimes that are not the best for us and that&#8217;s what growth is. So I want them to know they can always talk to us. But I want them to know the folks who have gone before us who have sacrificed and done a lot of things so that we have access to, public education that&#8217;s an integrated system that we have that access to, health care because you are blessed to have a parent that works somewhere she&#8217;s provided that coverage. And so I, yeah, for my children is an expectation about being trying and trusting to do what&#8217;s right. So we attend a great church that has different ethnicities and backgrounds. So it&#8217;s good for our kids to get to be around different types of folks and we have a biker&#8217;s ministry. So yeah and people from like I said from all over the country that are represented there and come from different areas of life and have done different things. But now to see them to talk about what their life is like now. So for us the rules are related to Christian principles but knowing that you do the best you can.   EJ:  How have state policies--, or your work, how does that influence how you raise your children or educate them?  ND:  So my children are fully aware of the work that I do or the work of advocates in general. And for me I started working on school improvement teams when my son was very young. [T]hird grade, well actually kindergarten I started doing school improvement teams. So I&#8217;ve been doing them for several years now. So being around the information center of the Justice Center and other partner organizations helped me help my students in the schools they were currently in and then helping like grade level chairs and administration about different policies. And the schools have been very open to showing me what their plans were and my saying different things. What about this, what about that? So my work and being around other advocates have helped in that way. And knowing what the policies are related to different things so whether it&#8217;s wanting the bus stop changed from the main highway to within the neighborhood and knowing how to do that properly and how if you&#8217;re doing that it&#8217;s not, &#8220;Oh well, I think this is better but it&#8217;s about a policy that you&#8217;re attaching to, why you are asking for the request. So teaching my children that, how to advocate for themselves as they&#8217;re older. Sometimes things are between the adults, but sometimes as you get older you can learn to speak up and advocate for yourself within certain guidelines so that&#8217;s helped them. And that when you&#8217;re an advocate, your kid gets exposed to looking at things in a different way and sometimes it could be good and sometimes it could be a challenge. Sometimes if you&#8217;re an advocate people may assume you&#8217;re looking at things in a bad light. But it&#8217;s not that you&#8217;re doing that. It&#8217;s that you&#8217;re looking how to improve, always how to do better. So it&#8217;s not necessary that I&#8217;m going here and going to tear something down and start over again. But no if I say that this is happening on playgrounds. You say this to me at the meeting, that my playground a lot of kids are getting hurt or kids are getting into altercations. Well, perhaps let&#8217;s change the playground behaviors by here&#8217;s a couple of steps we can have and then making it better. So not saying okay everything&#8217;s bad. No it&#8217;s great to have this outside time and for the adults that are outside to have a little bit of downtime. But let&#8217;s look at expectations for the adults that are outside and the kids are outside because you&#8217;re bringing me a problem that there are kids getting hurt. And it&#8217;s because there may not be as close proximity to what&#8217;s happening because you&#8217;re giving the kids room to be outside and express themselves and get some of their energy out. So always looking at things on how you can improve upon something and how we can improve ourselves and our own reaction to things. And not that everything is bad and we want to tear it down and do better, like I have better ideas. That&#8217;s not it. It&#8217;s about adding to the space in the room and not tearing it down but always adding, being adding value.  EJ:  Okay. Yeah. This drive to do better and improve things, were you always so driven before? Or how did you gain your political consciousness? Did it start with those school improvement teams or was it before then?  ND:  I think maybe it started at my old job a little bit working as a Disability Specialist for the social security state agency. So I found myself, when you are reviewing a person&#8217;s file, you&#8217;re looking at what their allegations are and looking at the file that you&#8217;ve built to see if they fit, meet the guidelines for being, the federal guidelines for being disabled and found myself pushing for different things even though it was against what the policy is about getting a case out there and completed in a certain period of time. So there is one person, I still remember his name, but I won&#8217;t say it. He was an alcoholic. But I felt strongly if I can get him to this appointment that there was an underlying physical condition that this new doctor, this doctor would find and so he would get disability benefits so he can get treatment. He was also homeless and had no phone. I was pretty clear on that. Well, this case because I had to schedule like three times because actually he couldn&#8217;t even get in the right shape to get to the appointment like he&#8217;s supposed to. So and couldn&#8217;t really talk to him so he would make calls to me from the local Social Security office, but the goal would&#8217;ve been for me to deny him at least a second time, forget it. But I really felt like he had peripheral neuropathy which is the--and he if we can get him on for that then he would have some income with a payee   helping him.   EJ:  What is peripheral neuropathy?  ND:  That&#8217;s a good question now that I&#8217;m so far out from it now. But it was a neurological condition. I remember the name but I don&#8217;t remember. That&#8217;s the thing being away from that work for so long and forgetting exactly what impairments are, but my supervisor believed in me and waited, let me do that and it was a Medicaid case, which is you&#8217;re supposed to get them out within a certain timeframe. But I really believed that he had this impairment and that if we had the most recent information--. And so I was right. I got him to, and I told him this is it. You&#8217;ve got to get there on time like you&#8217;re supposed to and do what I ask you to do so that we can help you. And so he did, and it was a very strong case for that peripheral neuropathy and developed a representative payee to get money than that would take care of his financial. So becoming advocate within that system and that&#8217;s what I&#8212;so I&#8217;ve done things like that but that was this one case where I really felt strongly that I needed to not get it out the door, but get it out the door properly. So I became an advocate within that system of pushing when I really felt strongly about a case.   So then yeah, and so then coming to the Justice Center to sue where I came from actually&#8212;  EJ:  Wow.  ND:  Yeah because where&#8212;so where we came from we were, I was doing the disability specialist level two work where we were working at we had to redo cases that were filed against Social Security, particularly the North Carolina state agency about processing claims related to high blood pressure, diabetes and pain at the time. And so I came to the Justice Center to work on that lawsuit once it left the legal services program in Charlotte and came here. So I came here to coordinate that case for the class counsel, and so that&#8217;s how I ended up getting here. So it just felt right to leave. So I came here on a three year grant and yeah, and left a state job where I was already vested and left on a three year grant to come here because I believed that I could learn a lot more, and it fit me more. Although I loved the work at the state agency. I really did love learning about the human body and making decisions and talking to people. So I get to, so I came here to work on that case, and there&#8217;s been hundreds of millions of dollars put in the hands of people through this lawsuit who were disabled and who were denied or had benefits terminated unfairly against the social security&#8217;s policy and the law. So I feel good about that work and in 2012 the Advocates for Justice who are formerly the Academy of Trial Lawyers gave me their lifetime achievement award.  EJ:  Wow, congratulations.  ND:  So that meant a lot for the group of mostly attorneys to give me that award. And so that&#8217;s how I got to that. So I&#8217;ve done, worked with the consumer litigators here at the Justice Center, which is very rewarding to work on a pay day case and other predatory lending cases and do that great work with the lawyers here and private law firms who are in the area and get what people are due back. And then it grew into my working on a Campaign for Better Care was a campaign particularly for older adults and caregivers and some people with disabilities. So it fit nicely into what my job had been for so many years. So what I did with that is travel the state and spoke with seniors, older adults and caregivers and people who care about that population and teach them about what coordinated care really means. And how when we have a primary home so a primary care provider and then we have something that we think is urgent, we have that person to say, &#8220;Well no just come to my office now,&#8221; or, &#8220;Come tomorrow,&#8221; or, &#8220;Yes, meet me at this hospital, that&#8217;s a big help.&#8221; And then we also wanted older adults to know that when you go to the hospital though it should be safe, a safe place. You shouldn&#8217;t come back sicker. But what happens many times is one in six elderly people actually go back into the hospital sicker than they were in thirty days because of not having this medical home person to connect with when they get home or leaving the hospital without a plan. Who do I contact when this happens, if this were to happen and what do I do? So leaving the hospital without a plan and then coming home and not being tapped into the proper resources. Then you see elderly folks going back into the hospital even sicker.  So those are the things that I talked about and then the Affordable Care Act was passed and even before that. Before it was passed but engaging people and letting them know related to older adults and seniors how kind the law is to them and what they should be looking forward to and what the truth is about it. So about for them having a instead [of] an annual visit there&#8217;s a wellness visit that they weren&#8217;t aware of, a conversation. Doctors don&#8217;t get paid to have conversations, but that&#8217;s an added benefit to them that the doughnut hole was narrowing and telling them now it&#8217;s at this point like last year saying fourteen percent you&#8217;re saving on generic drugs and fifty percent you&#8217;re saving on brand name drugs, which you get into the doughnut hole. So educating people about what to look forward to and that our meetings bringing what I call living resources. So I brought people from the SHIP program, the Seniors Health Insurance Program through the Department of Insurance and then the AARP sometimes with me. And having real leaving resources there at my meeting. So because I don&#8217;t do direct service really, but the folks in the community do. I thought it was important to have always have a resource there and have conversations with seniors and people who care about them but having living resources would be part of the discussion and actually helping people at the end of the meeting.   EJ:  Earlier you mentioned the Affordable Care Act. As an advocate what is your opinion of it? Do you think it goes far enough? Do you think it&#8217;s--?  ND:  Yeah, the Affordable Care Act is a landmark legislation that passed and was very excited when it did and the Justice Center was one of the groups that went around really talking about it and did a lot of work on making sure people knew the truth. So it is a step in the right direction. It gives people more access, more quality and more affordability than we&#8217;ve ever had before related to health care. And it is a great step in the right direction.   Now when the Supreme Court decided due the challenges brought before them, decided to make the Medicaid expansion part voluntary, that&#8217;s the thing that really was hard to swallow because there is a huge gap there. So if you go on the online marketplace and your income is 100 % to 400% of poverty so for a family of one for example 100% of poverty is about $11,300. So you get help, but if you are below that so if you make, so you&#8217;re below the poverty level so you make $10,000, you don&#8217;t get any help because it was expected. Everything put together in this law. So it was expected that states would be expanding because that&#8217;s what the law said. So it was expansion was up to yeah, over like 138%, I think that&#8217;s right. And so that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re missing. So there are a half a million people estimated that are in that gap and about over 300,000 people who for them there&#8217;s no other option but Medicaid. So we actually have created, because North Carolina decided not to expand and not to take the federal funds to do this we&#8217;ve actually created a huge problem here people actually have incomes that are too low to qualify them for help.   EJ:  Wow. Yeah. That&#8217;s quite a transition. I&#8217;ve grown up here my entire life and I&#8217;ve seen this state make many turns, but I mean, you&#8217;ve been in the state longer than I have, and how has North Carolina changed since you were growing up and--?  ND:  Let&#8217;s see. That&#8217;s a big question for me.  EJ:  Yeah, that&#8217;s a pretty big question, or politically. Yeah.  ND:  Yeah, well, for my knowledge I felt like North Carolina was becoming more progressive. And I thought we were doing a good job in creating programs to take care of people in this state and help them take care of themselves to provide them the tools. I see now it seems as though there&#8217;s a shift where there&#8217;s not as much available for people to take advantage of who are working really hard every day. And so when I talk to people, when I travel the state, you have people who are cutting pills in half, who are saying, &#8220;Well, all right so I&#8217;m supposed to exercise and move, but there&#8217;s no sidewalk in my community. So how do I do that?&#8221; Or there&#8217;s children who don&#8217;t have food always available to them, healthy food in the summer. So that&#8217;s why we have to make sure that we put dollars in local communities and then through the state programs to make sure that people have what they need to be economically secure. And I feel like, I have access to health coverage because I work at a place that provides it and subsidizes it and people I don&#8217;t think realize all the time when they are working somewhere that they&#8217;re getting something and are probably not paying the full cost of it and how much a blessing that is. And I don&#8217;t feel like I necessarily deserve more than the moms that I speak to across the state who want to be healthy and well for their children. If we really say we care about the children, then we would make sure that the parents are equipped to be able to. It&#8217;s hard to take care of a child when you&#8217;re hungry and you&#8217;re not feeling well and you could have a condition that could&#8217;ve been resolved very quickly. And what people say we should not spend our dollars on certain things. But however dollars spent on prevention do help people&#8217;s quality of life and as a human, we should care about human beings and their quality of their lives, but also we&#8217;re talking about money. When we delay care, what usually happens? Well, what happens is people usually get sicker. So either they die unnecessarily. Like we expect between 1,000 and 3,000 people, because Medicaid wasn&#8217;t expanded, we expect that number of people who may die unnecessarily or if you delay care, it costs more anyway. And when people use the emergency room for non-emergency care, it costs more to all of us. We&#8217;re all paying for it anyway. And if you look at the public health argument too, you want people who are in jobs serving you or in school and your kids. You want all of us to have access to immunizations and being able to take care of yourself and be able to go to the doctor if you have an impairment or sickness that could get other people sick. So we should think about as a whole. Health care is really one of the things that we really are in this thing together.   EJ:  How did you become interested in health care? Where did that come from?  ND:   Well, working on Social Security for so long. It&#8217;s a public benefit. At the Justice Center we have a health and public benefits group of folks. And so I was always in that group but really just because I did public benefits. And so we started talking as a group about&#8212;[break in recording]  EJ:  Okay so we were talking about how you got into the health arena.   ND:  So I was already working in public benefits. And so the team here was called Health and Public Benefits. So it was a group of people who would get together and look at our work plans and that sort of thing. But I didn&#8217;t do any real work in health care per se. So I&#8217;d been here for a while and it&#8217;s always good when the place you [are] working give you opportunities to stretch and grow and remake yourself and you&#8217;ve been here for a while. So I was able to do that. And so I became the assistant director of the Health Access Coalition in 2007, and at that time my work was to shadow some of the people who were in the Health Access Coalition and then to work on educating Wake County parents about the Medicaid program and NC Health Choice. And so I didn&#8217;t do enrollment myself, but my job was to encourage parents and provide information to them about that. Because there were still many people that the state felt were probably eligible but didn&#8217;t realize there was Medicaid or Health Check they called it, then also NC Health Choice where people have a little bit of higher income so incur some of the cost when they see the doctor. So that&#8217;s how I started out doing that.   And then when the bill for the Affordable Care Act started up, we decided as advocates that we needed to shift some focus in traveling the state and writing and understanding the bill. So that&#8217;s how I grew into more, doing more health related and more general work, not just related to children and low income families but related to the Affordable Care Act and traveling and learning a lot of it myself and how it affects different groups. So I did start talking to families and then doing the older adults, tagging it onto my Campaign For Better Care work and then growing into now going into communities especially Tier One communities so the lower income communities and [clears throat] excuse me, educating them about the Affordable Care Act and the provisions in it. But then when open enrollment&#8212;after it passed&#8212;then we started with open enrollment really ramping up a lot and telling people where they should go and how--. Since our state decided to give twenty-four million dollars back to the federal government to not have the Department of Insurance to do and other groups to do all this outreach and engagement. So we got less money, a lot less money, and so community agencies and legal services, legal aid and other groups were the navigators to help people sign up. So what we started doing was bringing navigators to our community meetings so people could make appointments there and then go back and actually sit down and do those and so those are more living resources doing that. [A] similar model I have for the Campaign for Better Care. And now that enrollment is closed for the most part, our meetings will look a little different. We&#8217;ll still talk about the Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion opportunity because we could at any time go ahead and take the, do the expansion. But also letting people know about special enrollment periods that there may be situations that happen, like having a baby or someone leaving the home, different things, or moving that means you can go back into the online market place and enroll and so outside of the traditional open enrollment.  EJ:  So in speaking of this targeted community as you mentioned both seniors and women, how are health issues women&#8217;s issues?  ND:  Well, anything that affects our families affects the woman in the family. I mean, folks say that if you get a woman to understand, &#8220;What doctor are we going to? What type of insurance is best for us? What plan should we pick?&#8221; Many times it&#8217;s the woman in the family that&#8217;s doing that. So many times if our meetings are pretty diverse depending on ethnicity, depending on where the meeting is, ethnicity and by gender. But I do believe that&#8217;s true if you give this information to the grandmother, the aunt, the mothers that they will tell their twenty-four year old grandson, &#8220;Look, you know you can stay on your parents&#8217; plan,&#8221; and so you&#8217;re right that anything that affects the family affects the woman.   EJ:  Now you also mentioned working mothers earlier and you are a working mother. And you, so last year when you ran for city council, you ran on a working mother background. Why is, town council sorry about that, town council? So when you ran for Apex town council you, how do you see work family balance? How is that important to you?  ND:  Well, it&#8217;s really important to me. My mother taught the whole time. My dad did different jobs, but my mom taught the whole time. And so being a teacher you&#8217;re home a little bit earlier. She was always home in the summer. And so, and my dad too obviously working for the school is different than working for a company you have to fly around, that kind of thing. So I was used to the family being available, more available. So for me, you&#8217;re right, I did talk about being a working mother. I didn&#8217;t want to run to say &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m a woman,&#8221; and the council doesn&#8217;t have a woman on it. Some people did say that and it was important to them. But I wanted to people to vote for me because they thought that, I talked about balance a lot and that I can prove to you with the work that I do with the Justice Center, that I travel, that I&#8217;m open, I understand things in a different perspectives that people can bring to the table and that I was already doing it, that I had support since my husband was self-employed. So we were able to balance schedules better because of that. If he was someone that traveled like me, that might be a little bit more challenging. But also my kids are getting a little bit older. So yeah, it has to be important to figure out how to do that when you have children because I do think the work that I do related to my state level work, which is what I consider my Justice Center work. And then my work in the local level issues with the town is something that has--, people have said to me, that helps your kids, I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re really proud of you and having a successful run and successful showing and to win a seat. And then I&#8217;ve had people say it&#8217;s not just something that your kids are proud of, but a lot of all kids can be, can see that, can run in a non-traditional, get a seat in a non-traditional way. Many times people get seats on councils, and they&#8217;ve served on planning boards, especially in Apex served on that sort of thing. Well, my family&#8217;s schedule changed by my son not being on a traveling team anymore. So I had more weekends available and more evenings available where you&#8217;re not running around all the time getting to different things during the week. So I did not see adding or asking to be on planning boards and things like that something that I was going to do. But what I have done at the local level is serving on the school improvement team. A lot of time you&#8217;re doing that. And also on the PTA being a legislative chair. So providing for the PTA community different updates regularly about different legislation that affects children and families and health mainly and obviously education. Doing that takes time and going to the meetings. So my work at a local level was more about the families who have school aged children. And then I&#8217;m the legislative action; well, I was on the HOA board at my previous neighborhood. So I understand a little bit about that thing and what neighbors want. But I&#8217;m the first legislative action chair in my current neighborhood, and I was asked to do that by the management company. And so in that role I do the same thing, similar to what I do in the schools, but focus it on changes to legislation or using that role to be a liaison between the developer, the management company and the people or the town and the people in the community. [A]n example before I became a council person was there&#8217;s a park that&#8217;s going up, going in, and it&#8217;s already there now. But it was going in right by my neighborhood, but I found that we were, the nature park was not put in the budget but that we were going to increase sales tax by half a cent. And so what I did was sent out a thing on our Facebook page, &#8220;Do people want me to go and represent us at this? Or do you want to go yourself, or how do you want to do it?&#8221; And people said fine. So I wrote up a little speech about health, reasons to have a park and health related, the economy, the environment and things like that. And I spoke. And I was quoted in the paper about that. So that was my first thing related to local government, and so what I did for the two years after that was to advocate especially the people who live right [there], their lots against where the parking would be. So an example was, well, the park is going to be great and we need ample parking so the people aren&#8217;t parking in our neighborhood and on the main street where now its visibility issues and EMS and emergency vehicles can&#8217;t get through because people are parked on both sides but ample parking. But don&#8217;t make parking a nuisance for the neighbors where it&#8217;s right up against their house. We need lighting for safety and other things. Something still going on and those lights are off, it&#8217;s over but don&#8217;t have the light shining down on the homes that are backed up. So trying to do a balance of here&#8217;s the great to do it before they start. Okay, two dog parks. Here is what I found out about what dog parks are supposed to have in there. Is this our plan to have these things? I don&#8217;t have pets so I had to look it up. So those are the things that I had done at the local level.   So the decision for me to run was by some of the folks in Apex who have heard about my work, seen my speaking about health care and particularly as it relates to the people in our communities who have low incomes and said, &#8220;We&#8217;d like to see you run and we&#8217;ll support you.&#8221; And so I prayed about it a lot, and I thought I had a year or so to decide, but I found out I had two weeks to file.   EJ:  Wow, what was that like?  ND: I really prayed about it and different people and many were people I didn&#8217;t know personally. These were people so didn&#8217;t have a lot of contact with me. But when I shared it with people who I did know well, they said, &#8220;Oh that is perfect for you. That is perfect for you.&#8221; So I had a broad range of support from people who don&#8217;t think you should ever build a house at all, you should never cut down a tree, to people who are to the extreme who don&#8217;t think that we should raise taxes at all even if people need something. So I had a broad range of support, and that&#8217;s so important. That in a non-partisan race like that where I didn&#8217;t have any background and experience in being an elected official working in that capacity that people trusted me as a person, not as Nicole the registered Democrat or Nicole the health care advocate or Nicole the certified paralegal or that they thought of me as what I said on my website. That I cared about balance, I cared about the town very much, that I wanted to work with people, I wanted to pull people together who believed differently instead of pulling us apart. I think we have more things in common than we know. So people said that I inspired them, and that&#8217;s a big responsibility because I don&#8217;t think of myself as someone that would inspire people. I&#8217;m just doing a job and I want to inspire people to speak for themselves, and I want to be--I&#8217;ve been referred to as a megaphone. So I want to be a megaphone to amplify the voices of people, but amplifying their voices, not necessarily Nicole&#8217;s voice, not necessarily what I think or I see but amplifying what they think is important to them that&#8217;s within what I can do.   EJ:  Where do you see the direction of North Carolina? Where do you see North Carolina going?  ND:  Well, right now I think we&#8217;re going in the wrong direction in some ways about the people that I really care about related to education funding, making sure the educators have what the need to do to do what they need to do for our children and so that our children feel that they can come to school and enjoy it. [S]ome of the things we&#8217;ve done make kids have to, like for example having to be tested and tested and tested related to reading for example sometimes can take the joy out of reading, reading for reading&#8217;s sake. So I commend the teachers and staff who can keep the interests of our kids up when they have to be tested so much. So I think that we&#8217;re going the wrong direction with that and with not expanding Medicaid, it&#8217;s in the wrong direction. But I&#8217;m hopeful because I always have to have hope. My faith tells me I have to have hope but to see people who stand up and say I want to make a change and I want to tell you my story. And sometimes telling your own story is hard because if you&#8217;re telling a Medicaid expansion story, you&#8217;re admitting that you don&#8217;t have enough to pay for something that your neighbor has enough to pay for. And it&#8217;s really hard to do that. But as a community it&#8217;s important for us to tell the stories, for us to lift the people up who are being left behind and let them know that we&#8217;re not going to leave them behind. So many of the people you see who speak out have insurance or have access or have good school or maybe they don&#8217;t have a struggle with taking tests, but they feel like all of us being more healthy in so many ways means all of us are moving forward. So I think we will move in the right direction as long as we make sure everyone in North Carolina understands the truth about what&#8217;s happening in North Carolina to them. If it&#8217;s happening to one of us, it&#8217;s happening to all of us.   EJ:  That&#8217;s a good point. And wrapping up, you mentioned life stories and if you were to rewrite your own life story thus far, would you do anything differently?  ND:  I&#8217;m sure I would. Sure. I think I would have done more things on my own, things that I wanted to do on my own I didn&#8217;t have the confidence to do earlier. I would make decisions. So for an example I was in the honors French program at UNC and loved the language, was taking literature in the language and that kind of thing and really should have gone at least to Canada for a semester. And I didn&#8217;t know anyone at the time that was doing it. So I held myself back saying, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m fine. I&#8217;ll just stay here.&#8221; So things like that I would&#8217;ve taken more opportunity. I would&#8217;ve taken a communications course. I would have pushed myself, right, in something that is not really my natural strength. So I would&#8217;ve pushed myself. I mean I have a neighbor that said, she&#8217;s a math major at NC State, and my father was, oh he said to her, &#8220;Oh you must be good in math.&#8221; She said, &#8220;No, I&#8217;m not. I&#8217;m pushing myself in an area that I&#8217;m not good so I can be more balanced.&#8221;   EJ:  Wow.  ND:  So if I could do things over I would push myself in the direction of things that I admired when I saw people doing them then or head about it. I wanted to be an artist actually. But people [ask], &#8220;What are you going to do with that? I know you can draw but what are you going to do with that? Who&#8217;s an artist? You&#8217;re not going to be able to pay the bills. How are you going to get health coverage?&#8221; With the Affordable Care Act now I can get health coverage. So I guess the things that I went through and that I experienced or saw got me to this path. And so we have our own personal story it does help us be more respectful when people share theirs. So I hadn&#8217;t thought a lot when you asked me about experiences related to race, and I&#8217;m sure there are others I could think of. They&#8217;re gone from my memory right this minute. But  yeah, I would push myself more and I what I value so much now with where I sit related to the town, related to North Carolina and the work that I do is being around people of different ethnicity and faiths, being around different people like that really energizes me. And so when you talk about balance, sometimes it&#8217;s hard to cut off my town time a little bit because so for an example, on another issue related to growth, a mom was talking about if we do this certain project it was going to impact traffic near her child&#8217;s school. So I reached out to her and said, found her number and called her and said, &#8220;I heard that part. But here&#8217;s why I voted this way.&#8221; I gave her the, &#8220;Here&#8217;s why I did this. But here&#8217;s what I want to do. I want to come and have your experience and just--.&#8221; So I parked where she parks in her neighborhood and I walked over to the school in her path and then met the parents who were out there wanted to talk about it or anything they wanted to talk about related to the town. So and then walked back that bridge, and so it was easier for me to advocate for them. So pulling that piece out. &#8220;I heard you and I voted this way and I feel fine about my vote the way I did it because what&#8217;s before me. But I still heard you so I want to amplify your voices about that.&#8221; So I asked the NCDOT to do a left turn signal and here&#8217;s why and to put a guard rail up and here&#8217;s why. And I didn&#8217;t just talk to this mom, I walked in her shoes.  EJK:  You walked in her shoes.  ND:  And walked back in her shoes and just didn&#8217;t have the extra kids because when you&#8217;re walking this way maybe one kid in a stroller. You&#8217;ve got another kid and a book bag and maybe have a neighbor&#8217;s kid with you. So that&#8217;s what those are things that--, it&#8217;s hard for me to cut off the town. It&#8217;s the balance I have to work every day. Sometimes we talk about the things we needed to work on too. So as a Christian I know I've got to work too. So my balance is because I&#8217;m energized by the town work and the people&#8217;s response to what I&#8217;m trying to do, and what we&#8217;re trying to do as a group of people working together. And then getting energized too about when I&#8217;m in the communities, I mean working with people. I mean I went to a Laundromat in Martin County and met a woman there and she took the rest of my flyers and I headed back home. And she came to the event and brought someone. So the impact of if I hadn&#8217;t made another step and gone to the Laundromat wouldn&#8217;t have met her, and the person she brought does not have health coverage. So it is, so for me it&#8217;s hard to--, I have to work every day with that balance, with my family time, and so I do take a lot of time off when I came and shut myself down, let people know I&#8217;m unavailable right now other than emergencies obviously so to give my family and--.  EJ:  Recharge.  ND:  Right, recharging myself. So being here at the Justice Center with so much leave time and being, working for a town where there&#8217;s only, there&#8217;s a one of five folks. So there&#8217;s other folks to be contacted and working with the town manager who knows okay, I&#8217;m in this space right here. I&#8217;m doing this. But if something happens, let me know, but I may not be available real quickly, real timely, but I will always be engaged with the work I do in local level and state level because it&#8217;s important to move people forward while we&#8217;re here living this life.  EJ:  That&#8217;s great. Thank you so much for this interview. I&#8217;m just wondering one last thing. If there is anything that I left out that you wanted to mention or--?  ND:  I guess related to town council I just wanted to make it really clear that now being on this side of things, being an elected official and I feel I have a great responsibility to listen and that what I feel great about is the people who still come up to me now from a November election and say I voted for you and I&#8217;m inspired by you. And so to have people like I said from all, from Apex who have different beliefs. Like I said it didn&#8217;t, or Republican, Democrat, independent to support my campaign and to support me now, which I need continued support. I want to say how great that is and how honored I am to represent a town like that.   EJ:  Well, that&#8217;s great. Thank you so much for your interview.  ND:  Okay.
