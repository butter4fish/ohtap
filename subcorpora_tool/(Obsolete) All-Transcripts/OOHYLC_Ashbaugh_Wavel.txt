(Laughs) Anyway, the  nuns liked me. I didn   t get into bad trouble. They could make me feel  bad if they   d say   we ran away once, because she wanted to. When we  came back one of the nuns said,    Wavel, we are so surprised at you.     Oh boy, that hurt. That hurt. (Laughs) Okay, so what else can I tell you  now?

Ashbaugh I   d go out there, but they wouldn   t let do it because I cried. (Laughs)  Finchum Why did you cry?  Ashbaugh I was afraid to touch the eggs.

Finchum What will you do in your free time?  Ashbaugh Read.  Finchum Read? A favorite author?  Ashbaugh No, I don   t have a favorite. I like to read historical romances. I prefer a  biography so much. Read about someone and learn something while  I   m doing it.  Finchum He   s pointing to your Harper Lee.  Ashbaugh Yeah.  Finchum To Kill a Mockingbird.  Bishop Go Set a Watchman     Ashbaugh Yeah, I   ve been reading that. That   s good, Go Set a Watchman. You  read a lot?  Bishop I never have enough time. (Laughs)  Ashbaugh That   s an excuse. (Laughter) I won   t buy that. Nice try. (Laughs)  Finchum Try again Alex  What time do you go to bed?  27  Ashbaugh Probably by ten o   clock. Not before unless I have had a busy, busy day.  If I go to sleep, by ten o   clock.  Finchum How do you keep up with current events? Newspaper or TV or what?  Ashbaugh I read the paper from cover to cover. I watch the news, but not as much  as I read the paper. Then, I have nieces that are up on everything.  (Laughter) I better be able to discuss it. When they say,    What do you  think about    something, I can   t say,    What   s that?     Finchum I think that might be your secret  Yeah  You keep your mind busy.  Ashbaugh Oh yes  Doing the best I can.  Finchum You   re doing great I think   Ashbaugh Thank you. All right.  Finchum What is the biggest change in Tulsa? Since you left in    40 and came  back in 2014, 2015, what was the biggest change?  Ashbaugh Actually, I ended up moving around so I can   t say that. What   s the  biggest change? I   ve said this before and I will repeat it. With my  context, we had more time for each other, and we were closer. People  don   t have, here or anyplace, don   t have time now, or take the time to  spend time to talk. Everybody, everything is moving so fast, you have  to move to go with it. I like the feeling of having a close family, close  friends. Tulsa or wherever you are, Tulsa is, my mother was born here,  my grandmother, my great-grandmother. Tulsa is     Finchum Home.  Ashbaugh    home.  Finchum Some of that would occur on the front porch?  Ashbaugh Yes, all right.  Finchum There   s not too much front porch sitting now days.  Ashbaugh No. Now, the porch that we had, it went halfway around the house. We  saw a house the other day, and I pointed it out to them. That   s the way it  used to be. It was a porch but with a roof, and a swing on the front  porch, front porch swing. You always had that. In the evening, you  went out there on the swing, if you had a nice evening.  28  Finchum Good old days.  Ashbaugh Good old days, yeah. Good days now, honey. Everything   s very good.  Everything   s really wonderful seems to me, because we have more, can  realize more what we want in our life. We have more help. If we want  to do things, we have all kinds of help. We have money, we have  schools, we have teachers. If you want to achieve something, you can  do that, if you work at it.  Finchum Couldn   t have said it better myself. Well, you   re a good role model.  Ashbaugh Thank you.  Bishop When history is written, what do you want it to say about you? How do  you want to be remembered?  Ashbaugh How do I want to be remembered? The way I lived. I care about people.  I care about God. Whatever I do, I try to live good. I care about people.  I love my family very much. That is, I would like to see each one of  them be happy. See if they can get what they want, if it   s not too much.  (Laughter)  Bishop You said God, was church a very important part in your life? Was  church and going to mass?  Ashbaugh Yes, uh-huh. I don   t go to mass every Sunday, but I am a Catholic. Not  a practicing one, but I am a Catholic.  Finchum Was it important when you were growing up?  Ashbaugh Very. I was in school. That   s where, I was in the fifth grade when I was  baptized. That was my doing. My sister wasn   t, and my mother didn   t  care. It was after I had been there a little while, I decided that is what I  wanted to be. They did a good job, and that   s what I wanted.  Bishop I want to back up. I have a question that has been bothering me. You  said you went to boarding school, right? You essentially went to  boarding school with the Benedictines.  Ashbaugh I went to boarding school, but the school also had day pupils.  Bishop Yeah.  Ashbaugh It was called Sacred Heart then. I lived there, there wasn   t very many.  Only two or three girls that lived there.  29  Bishop What was the discipline like?  Ashbaugh Very strict. Very strict  Fortunately, I am very good. I was very good.  My sister wasn   t. (Laughs) I am very good. If you told me to sit there  and be there, I would do that. Besides that, I liked the nuns. I wouldn   t  do anything that would hurt them. I always had a favorite nun. My  favorite nun was like school, you have a teacher that you really love.  Bishop Do you remember her name?  Ashbaugh Sister Francis. One of my cousins, my bad influence cousin     Creamer Juanita.  Ashbaugh     she was eight months older than me, and we boarded at the school.  She got me to run away. She told me,    Sister Francis hit you.    I said,     No, nobody hit me.    She said,    Yes I saw her. When we were standing  in line today, I saw her.    She said,    Get in line.    She said,    She hit you  so we   re going to run away.    We did, because I went wherever she told  me. She explained to me,    She hit you, she was mean to you. When  they go in today, you stay and sit on the curb because we   re going to  run away.    We did. She knew how to do it. We ran, she ran away.  She had a stepfather, ex-stepfather, who drove a taxi. She knew where  to get him. She said,    We   ll get him, and he   ll take us around.    So we  did. He did. He took us to dinner, riding around, and I don   t know  where. He was going to take us wherever she said to go. After we had  dinner, he drove us around, the car stopped right at the school. He took  my hand and took us to living room. The nuns were standing there.  People were so surprised. He said,    I kept them all day because they  wanted to go someplace, and I knew I   d bring them back tonight.     (Laughs) I was raised very strict. The nuns were very understanding  compared to my mother who was very, very, very strict. (Laughs) I had  a good schooling. I was happy. I am happy. He   s getting bored.  Bishop No, no   Ashbaugh Pretty soon he   ll be doing this foot like this  (Gestures)  Finchum I think he   s wanting to go waltzing with you. He wants to waltz around  the room with you   Ashbaugh Okay. (Laughs)  Finchum Anything else you want to tell us? Anything else we need to ask?  30  Ashbaugh Have I told everything?  Rodrequez I think so.  Ashbaugh Did I miss anything?  Rodrequez Not much   Creamer Not much.  Ashbaugh Nan, did I miss anything.  Creamer Not much.  Bishop Well, when your niece was born, do you remember when your niece was  born?  Ashbaugh What   s he going to do?  Finchum He said do you remember when your niece was born?  Ashbaugh Oh yes  (Laughter) The doctor handed me this baby. He put her in my  hands and said,    Here   s your baby.    My sister was there looking real  pleased with yourself. He said,    Here   s your baby.    She is my baby.  She smiles like my baby.  Creamer Always will be.  Ashbaugh She was.  Finchum Did you get to name her?  Creamer Oh yeah. She already had three.  Ashbaugh Of course. She   s my baby. (Laughs) My sister looked very pleased.  Almost like,    Here   s your baby.    My sister looked like,    You can have  her.    (Laughter)  Creamer Tell her what she did when she married.  Ashbaugh She   s the only niece that I have. She was my baby and is my baby.  Rodrequez What happened when it came time to take the baby back?  Ashbaugh Oh, I hate to think of that. My mother and I had her and took care of  her. My sister was divorced and running around. My mother, we took  31  care of the baby. Then my sister decided to get married. We had her a  year or two years, I don   t know what. My sister came to take her baby,     her    baby. I cried and screamed up and down. I said to my mother,     They   re taking my baby.    Momma said,    It   s not your baby. It   s not  your baby.    My sister   s married and going to take her child. I cried,  cried, cried. It was my baby. I said,    No. It   s my baby.    After all, she  had slept with me. She was my baby. See how she (Creamer) turned  out, how sweet she turned out? (Laughs) It   s because I hugged her. She  could sleep with me and I could hug her.  Finchum Did you teach her how to dance?  Ashbaugh Yes. From day one.  Finchum Well, did she dance when she walked?  Ashbaugh Oh     Finchum Like you?  Ashbaugh When I walked her, I danced with her. She can dance, they can all  dance. They better dance. (Laughter) If I find anybody in the family  can   t dance, they   re in deep trouble.  Finchum When was the last time you danced?  Creamer About a month ago.  Ashbaugh About a month ago, she is saying, but not like I used to. I was a little  stiff, but I am a dancer. I can still dance, but not very much.  Finchum Can   t do the tango.  Ashbaugh I might do about three steps if the partner knew what he was doing.  (Laughter)  Rodrequez What about the cha-cha?  Ashbaugh Oh yes  I love the cha-cha.  Rodrequez Did you do the cha-cha?  Ashbaugh I could do the cha-cha now.  Rodrequez Can you stand up and do a few cha-cha steps?  32  Ashbaugh No  (Laughs)  Rodrequez Oh come on.  Finchum We can make room and turn the camera the right way?  Creamer Aunt Wavel, remember when we went to the Mexican restaurant and  we started out, they were playing the cha-cha music out at Abuelo   s, or  at Los Cabos. Aunt Wavel is walking just a little bit ahead of me, and I  look and she had those hips moving, doing the cha-cha-cha   Ashbaugh I   m a dancer. I   ve danced for a good time.  Finchum Well, you may dance just a little bit for us in a minute, but not right  now. Okay?  Ashbaugh Okay   Finchum All right   Ashbaugh I don   t know if I   m dancing today.  Finchum All right.  Ashbaugh Am I dancing today?  Rodrequez If you feel like it?  Finchum All right, well we will just close here then. Thank you for talking with  us. You   ve been great.  Ashbaugh Thank you.  Finchum Thank you.  -------  -------
