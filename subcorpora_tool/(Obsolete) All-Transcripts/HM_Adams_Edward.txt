Story_ID: 597680
Speaker 1: And you were gonna tell me a story about them coming to the United States from Barbados?

Speaker 2: His name was Israel Adams [ph.].
Speaker 1: Do you know anything about your grandparents on your father's side?
Speaker 2: He was a tailor and the reason I know that is that many people that came over from Barbados would always tell me that he made their first pair of long pants.  So, and--and what I recall about--he never came to the United States, but his--but--but my grandmother came to the states and she lived in Brooklyn [New York].  She died when I was probably two or three years old, so I never knew her.  She was--had diabetes and was blinded by it.  Well that's all I know about those folks.
Story_ID: 597682
Speaker 1: All right, well then let's talk about your mother [Ernesta Larier Adams] and father [Clarence Adams, Sr.], do you know how they met?

Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Those are the two siblings.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 597683
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, tell me where you were raised.
Speaker 2: I was raised--well I was born in the house in Harlem [New York, New York], 116th Street.  And I went to a school down the street called P.S. 184 [New York, New York].  And I lived there unt- until I was fifteen years old I guess.
Speaker 1: Okay, so let's talk about your elementary school years.  Tell me about the neighborhood on 116th Street, what was it like back then?
Speaker 2: It was--the neighborhood was all black, except for the merchants.  The merchants, they were--were Jewish, there was a Filipino barbershop.  There was a--a millinery shop which people that owned that were named Heideners [ph.].  And then there was a Hispanic grocery store called Rodriguez [ph.].  And all the kids played in the street and played kick the can, and lodies [ph.] and all kinds of games in the streets.
Speaker 1: Good.  What else about the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: We had a movie house across the street called the Regan [sic. Regent Theatre, New York, New York] where we'd go Saturdays and look at about five thousand cartoons and old movies.  We'd then go--we'd often got to Central Park [New York, New York].  We'd go to Mount Morris Park [New York, New York] and play.  All within walking distance.  It was just a fun time.  We did have a share of what we call now homeless, but we had a few bums.  And the interesting thing about them is they used to cook sweet potatoes in the backyards of the tenement buildings.  And then we had--we still during the early years they were icemen and people would cut blocks of--they--they'd bring these big slab of ice, they'd drop them on the sidewalk and then these people would cut them up into blocks, square blocks and take them to people's refrigerators.
Speaker 1: I remember that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 597684
Speaker 1: I was gonna ask you what sounds, sights and smells remind you of that time [in Harlem, New York, New York].  You gave me a couple of sights and the smells--the smell of sweet potatoes, you could smell that?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, when they cook them in backyards, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what other sights and sounds do you remember?
Speaker 2: Let's see, I don't know.
Speaker 1: What about hot summer days?
Speaker 2: Oh that's when they turned the hydrants on.  And the kids would be playing in the hydrants until their folks came and turned them off (laughter).
Story_ID: 597685
Speaker 1: Who were your friends at that time, do you remember?
Speaker 2: Sure.  Little Richard [ph.], funny the kids have really interesting names.  A fellow named Turkey [ph.].  Of course Little Richard because there was another guy named Richard, so you had to give them different, so Little Richard and Big Richard [ph.].  At that stage, I had a little girlfriend named Dottie [ph.].  That's when I was like seven or eight.  And you asked a little from that--that period.  Then when I went to junior high, it was a different thing.  I went to junior high at P.S. 40--or Junior High School 43 [J.H.S. 43, Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. School, New York, New York].  And I had to take the bus to go there.  They--cause that was on Amsterdam Avenue and I believe 127th [Street]--128th Street [sic. 129th Street].  And I was in the rapid advanced class, which we did seventh and eighth grade in one year.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And then that year was--a fellow by the name of Preston Jackson [ph.] was my main buddy.  We get in trouble together (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 597686
Speaker 1: Let's go back to elementary school for a moment.  Tell me about P.S. 184 [New York, New York], who were your teachers when you went to that school?
Speaker 2: I can, can't--I can remember a teacher that was there that wasn't my teacher named Miss Cooper [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And why I remember Miss Cooper is because at that time, even though the school was 100 percent black, all the teachers were white, except when Miss Cooper came.  She was black and she had wh- at that time, what we call special education now, but those days they said CRMD, children with retir- retarded mental development, and she taught that--that group.  And I think they played cowboys and Indians [Native American] all day (laughter).  Now that's my memory of teachers.  I--I can't recall any that were significant to me in--in those days.
Speaker 1: What--what type of student were you in elementary school?
Speaker 2: I was a very good student in terms of academics.
Speaker 1: What was your best subject?
Speaker 2: Math.  And that's why I got to go into the special program that did two years in one--in one.  I was skipped once in elementary school too.
Speaker 1: What grade did you skip?
Speaker 2: Elementary school, probably, and I don't recall precisely, probably the fourth grade.
Story_ID: 597687
Speaker 1: This was 1939, tell me--you told me about the merchants, but do you remember whether there were a lot of--you said you lived in a house or an apartment [in Harlem, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: An apartment, apartment.
Speaker 1: You lived in an apartment, okay.  The other people in your building, who were they and what types of jobs did your friends' parents have?
Speaker 2: Oh, one man, Mr. Flemings [ph.], if my memory is right, was a merchant seaman and a cook on the ships, a cook with the Merchant Marines [U.S. Merchant Marine].  I'm trying to think what else.  Mr. Duncan [ph.], I didn't know what he did.  Next door was Miss Brewster [ph.] who had been a domestic, as my mother [Ernesta Larier Adams] was.  I think all of those folks had, they were all employed, I don't recall what they all did--
Speaker 1: Okay that's fine (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) but they went to work every day.
Story_ID: 597688
Speaker 1: Speaking about employment, you said your mother [Ernesta Larier Adams] was a domestic?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Do you remember who she used to work for?
Speaker 2: Oh she worked for various--various people.
Speaker 1: And what about your father [Clarence Adams, Sr.]?
Speaker 2: He was a stationary engineer, I don't know if you know what that is.
Speaker 1: Tell me.
Speaker 2: He was in charge of all the maintenance for a building, a business building downtown in New York [New York].  So he took care of all the--the steam, all the repairs, et cetera.
Speaker 1: Do you know how much education your father had?
Speaker 2: He had the equivalent of high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what about your mother?
Speaker 2: She had the same.
Speaker 1: Was education stressed--
Speaker 2: Yeah, very much so.
Speaker 1: --very much so in your, okay.
Speaker 2: Probably more by my brother [Clarence Adams, Jr.] then by my--by my mother and father.  But there was no question about--about college.  And they were really demanding in terms of--of your achievement.
Story_ID: 597689
Speaker 1: Junior High School 43 [J.H.S. 43, Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. School, New York, New York], and tell me about your experience there?
Speaker 2: Well now, this--this became my first integrated class.  And we had some really good, I thought, teachers that I--that I admired.  Miss Solomon [ph.], which was a Jewish teacher that was--really took to me because I did have some behavioral problems.  And she managed them quite well (laughter) and kind of straightened me out.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Well, what do you mean?
Speaker 2: Things like talking in class, clowning, that sort of thing.  Then, we had a French teacher, was the first black teacher I had, named George Manley.  And gee I can't think of who else, oh and we had a black teacher named Miss Blakey [ph.] that didn't like me.  I mean you can tell when a teacher doesn't like you and gave me a hard time, but I prevailed.
Speaker 1: All right. And what about the students?  Now, this is your first--
Speaker 2: Oh my, the students there?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: I made some good friends there, Preston Jackson [ph.] was one of the--was one of my good friends.  Haywood Young [ph.] who was a interesting guy.  He was Chinese and African American (background noise), let it ring.
Speaker 1: All right, so we were talking about your friends and what happened at junior high school?
Speaker 2: Well we used to do a couple of things which are looked upon as being pretty bad.  There was a bus terminal a few blocks from our school and at lunchtime, we would go up to the bus terminal and get in the buses and open and close the doors (laughter).  And then the other thing we would do is we would go into City Ha- City College [City College of New York, New York, New York], which was very close to the school, and we would go and walk through the tunnels underneath the buildings.  So those were some of the exciting things.  And then we had, I remember having a fight, which my friend Preston put me up to.  And was told that I couldn't (unclear) with a girl named Margaret Davis [ph.] and she actually beat the hell out of me.  So the guys told me that--that could not stand, so I would have to--to redeem myself.  And so they advised me to call for a rematch and just pop her in the eye and it'll be all over.  So I did that and it was all over.  So that ended that sto- that story.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) All right.
Story_ID: 597690
Speaker 1: So, tell me about your academics in junior high school [J.H.S. 43, Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. School, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Oh they were very good.  And they were good enough for me to get a scholarship to--at the Horace Mann School [Bronx, New York], which was a prestigious, at the time, all-boys country day prep school.
Speaker 1: Where was this school?
Speaker 2: In the Bro- Bronx, New York.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Actually--well it's--it's in the Bronx in a section of the Bronx called Riverdale.  They decided that--this was 1952, I guess.  They decided they would like to integrate.  So they decided that they would have one African American in the fourth form which would be the sophomore year of high school.  One in the third form, one in the second form, and one in the first form which is sixth grade.  And I was the one in the fourth form.  So as a result of that, I became the first African American to graduate from the Horace Mann School.
Story_ID: 597691
Speaker 1: Before we go on into high school [Horace Mann School, Bronx, New York], what were some of the activities as a young man living in Harlem [New York, New York], were you a member of any organizations?
Speaker 2: No I was not that I can recall.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did you take music or a foreign language?
Speaker 2: I took a foreign language in school, sure, we had to.  We took French.
Speaker 1: You took French, okay.  Were you a Cub Scout?
Speaker 2: I was a Cub Scout.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't recall anything other than getting the uniform and putting it on (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay. Anything else you remember about--about your elementary or junior high school years [at P.S. 184 and J.H.S. 43, Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. School, New York, New York]?  Was music a part of your life?
Speaker 2: Listening to it.  I--listening to music.  I never played an instrument, which is something I somewhat regret at this point in my life.
Speaker 1: And you used to listen to the radio?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Gee I'm thinking in those days, probably my junior high school days it was Alan Freedman--Alan Freed was a disk jockey and he played a lot of rock and roll, rock and roll music, which I liked to play loud (laughter).
Story_ID: 597692
Speaker 1: Now, before we get to the '50s [1950s], actually you grew up in the '40s [1940s] also, do you remember--
Speaker 2: The '40s [1940s] yeah.
Speaker 1: --well is it war time?
Speaker 2: Well I remember two things.  I remember when my brother [Clarence Adams, Jr.] came back from the war [World War II, WWII].  I was in the street playing and I kind of made him a kind of a--to all my buddies, "Come and see my--come see my brother, he's a sergeant, a sergeant." I remember that.  I think, what else in the '40s [1940s].  Golly, I can't remember whether it was the '40s [1940s] or '50s [1950s] when Tom Dewey [Thomas E. Dewey] ran for president and all the kids were saying, "If Dewey became president, we'd all be on--on welfare, we'd all be on the poverty line," et cetera, et cetera, I remember that.
Story_ID: 597693
Speaker 1: Let's go onto your high school days at Horace Mann [Horace Mann School, Bronx, New York].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now, you were considered very bright in your school before going to Horace Mann.  When you get there, are there other students now competition becomes--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: --greater?  Tell me about that?
Speaker 2: Well, it--it's again was a situation where I was the only black person in the--in the--in the grade.  And all my friends were either very bright or--or very--either very bright or very rich (laughter), okay, mostly rich.  But I made some great friends there.  In fact, I just came back in October from our--October 2005 from our fiftieth anniversary.  And that graduating class, I think, had 101, 102 in--in the class.  And I think we had about sixty-five at the reunion.  And what I can recall, some interesting things I reflect upon.  We--I would study with a fella by the name of Everett Marx [ph.].  And the first time I went to study at his house, which was in Central Park West [New York, New York], the doorman told me to use--I had to use the service entrance--elevator.  Well he straightened that out, but that was kind of interesting situation.  But I had some--some really good friends and I did not experience any from the students, any racial harm--you know, problems.  Interesting story, I played football and I was not the fastest runner in the world.  And the coach came over to me one day and said, "Ed [HistoryMaker Edward Adams], what's wrong with you?" I said, "What do you mean coach?"  He said, "Well most colored guys I know can run like greased lightning," (laughter).  And then I had, I think I--I had some teachers, who in retrospect, who I think, particularly a biology teacher named Mr. Moody [ph.] who I think had a streak in him that was racist.  But, I, I, I, I did not do well in--in there.  So I was a mediocre--in Horace Mann, I was a--an average student.  But it was a, I think, whe- a really great experience for me.  I was exposed to how the wealthy lived.  I mean, I went to a house of one of my classmates in Yonkers [New York].  It was the first time I'd ever been in a house where the couch was not against the wall (laughter).  So at that--at that point, I think my aspirations became really great in terms of what I wanted to do, and what I wanted to accomplish in life.  And when I--I was sixteen at the time of graduation and Horace Mann wanted me to stay another year and they would've, you know, given me a scholarship for another year because I was so young.  I told them, "No thanks."
Story_ID: 597694
Speaker 1: So, you were saying at, at sixteen you were--were ready to graduate [from the Horace Mann School, Bronx, New York] and they wanted you to stay, okay?
Speaker 2: Well, I--I think for a couple of reasons.  One is I think they had a philosophical problem about being old enough, mature enough to tackle college.  And secondly, I think that they wanted me to get my grades up so that I could get into MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And schools like that pride themselves on how many kids get into Ivy League schools or the equivalent, which MIT would've been one.  But I declined.
Speaker 1: Who were the teachers there that might have encouraged you?
Speaker 2: I think there was a--a--a Mr. Little [ph.] who taught English and drama.  And I was very active in the dramatic clu- club, and although I only appeared in one play, which was 'The Hasty Heart' [John Patrick] and in that play there was an African by the name called Blossom and that's the only word he could say in--in English was blossom.  So, not wanting to have a white person play that part (laughter), they asked me to play it.  And I played it and this--during the stage all the time you got one word in this whole play to say several times one word.  And that play went on very well and I can--got involved in the--in the club, but in terms of back stage stuff, you know, stage managing and that sort of stuff.  And Mr. Little was really, really a very great influence.  There was another teacher whose name I don't recall, who was definitely from the South with a southern accent.  And you know how you always assume that from the South they're gonna be prejudiced and he was not, he was a charmer.  And that's--those are about the teachers that I remember the most.  Of course, there was the football coach, yeah.  But that's--that's about all I remember.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: All right, do you think that any of the teachers might have not given you the grade that you deserved because you were black?
Speaker 1: I--I don't think so.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I think with the situation, with the benefit of the doubt, they may not have.  But I--I never entered--I never entertained that thought, they may have done that, but I never entertained that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 597695
Speaker 1: Now, you had one experience going to a classmate's home and being told to use a different elevator, but before that time, had you experienced any prejudice or racism?
Speaker 2: Not really.  Not that I was aware of.  I'll tell you--while we're in Horace Mann [Horace Mann School, Bronx, New York] in high school, I'll tell you one--one great story about swimming, how I learned to swim.  When I went to--I was always large for my--for my age and when we--the gym class at that--when I got to be a soph- got there, all the other kids who had been there sent from the first form on, were able to swim.  But the class was swimming so I had to use these water wings.  So here's this big guy and at this time the class was diving, not swimming, diving.  So here's this big guy with these water wings around his waist (laughter) and I jumped in the pool and then I looked around and the water wings were about twenty yards away (laughter), so I had to swim.  So I learned to swim that way.
Speaker 1: Besides football, were there any other classes that you took, maybe tennis or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No, but the only team sport was--was football.
Story_ID: 597696
Speaker 1: How do you decide where you're gonna go to college?
Speaker 2: Well, that was--that was--first of all, I, I, I wanted to be an engineer.  I wanted to be an aeronautical engineer.
Speaker 1: How did you know that's what you wanted to do?
Speaker 2: I think from my--from being--from my early times when people would say, "Hey what do you wanna be when you grow up?"  I'd say, "I wanna be an engineer."  And I think they thought, one thing and I was thinking about driving a train (laughter).  But subsequently, I was--recognized I was good at math and science, and found out what engineers do and I had this fascination for airplanes at that time the, you know, the jet fighters were coming out and I did some models and whatnot, and--and I said, well I'd like to be--to design airplanes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I looked at--at schools that had those programs, then I looked at what I could afford and then the shock came, that going away to college was not gonna be feasible, that I would have to live at home and go to school.  So that left the New York [New York] colleges.  And I applied to NYU College of Engineering [New York University College of Engineering], I got in there.  Now that's--that college of engineering was subsequently sold to Brooklyn Poly Tech [Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, Brooklyn, New York] and then they formed New York Institute of Technology [sic. Polytechnic Institute of New York; New York University Tandon School of Engineering, Brooklyn, New York].  But at the time it was one of the schools at--in--in New York University.
Story_ID: 597697
Speaker 1: So, you are sixteen years old when you go into college?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So, tell me about that transition?
Speaker 2: Well, I think the first thing, while the Horace Mann [Horace Mann School, Bronx, New York] experience was a good one, it left me socially behind.  And so when it was time for the prom, I had to get a date.  So, my sister [Marilyn Adams Moore] got one of her sorority sisters' sisters for my date.  And this was a rather tall, large girl, and her name was Sandy [ph.].  And so, I had her for a date for the prom.  And of course I was socially backwards anyway and subsequently, my guys would tease me and call me Sandy.  But--so, I--I think that--that had I gone to a coed school, I would have been a lot socially advanced.  But it wasn't the transition because I was a, a, a subway student at NYU [New York University College of Engineering; New York University Tandon School of Engineering, Brooklyn, New York], the transition was not difficult.  I think--I think if I was sixteen and went away to college it would've been a different story.  But being a commuting student, yeah I did a lot of silly things in my first year of college too, which may have been part of immaturity thing, issue.  My buddy and I in college would cut the ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] so we could ride on the--get to a certain train that had the Walton High School [Bronx, New York] girls coming home from school.  And we subsequently failed ROTC (laughter).  We also did things like guess in--in chemistry.  In organic chemistry we would rather spend time in the lab doing the unknown solutions, you know, doing all the test for it, we'd just guess at them and leave.  And as a result, we obviously failed that.  Well, I survived, but he didn't.  So, he (laughter)--he lost a year and, and--but I--I managed to get by and, and, and not lose any time with school.

Speaker 1: What else was going on in New York City [New York, New York] during this time, this was the middle '50s [1950s]--well, really the early '50s [1950s] because you are going in in 19--what year did we say?  Fifty-five [1955], 1955.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I'm trying to think of what was going on in '55 [1955].  I think at--at that time, I think I--I know I developed a love for jazz, jazz music.  And I think we had, at that time, Max Roach and Miles Davis, and those--those fellows were coming into their own.  There was a pl- there was a place called Snookie's Sugar Bowl [New York, New York] which was kind of a hangout for--for those who were not old enough to drink, but of course I was in this group that was only--I think drinking age was eighteen at that time in New York.  So, they would have, I don't know how this happened, they had Champale and that was the big drink--Champale with a cherry in it, that was a big deal there.  But it was Snookie's Sugar Bowl, it was kind of an ice cream parlor place where we'd hang out.  And--
Speaker 1: Do you remember where it was?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was on 7th Avenue [Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard] and 137th Street I believe.  And at that time I think all--a lot of stuff was going on in the South, particularly in--in--in the Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 1: Was just beginning.  Well, Brown versus the Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] was the year before and it was just beginning to, to, to gear up.  But in Harlem [New York, New York], did you go to the Apollo Theater?
Speaker 2: Oh sure.
Speaker 1: Tell me about some of your experiences and who you saw there?
Speaker 2: Oh golly.  I think I even saw [HistoryMaker] Eartha Kitt at the Apollo.  I, I--in--if that was--I remember seeing 'New Faces of 1954' [sic. 'New Faces of 1952'] that was in New York.  Not--not downtown, that was--I believe Eartha Kitt was in that one.  Let's see who else I--what else I saw.  But I saw--I recall seeing, well, you know, the groups were out at--at that time, The Temptations, The Coasters.  I--I saw James Brown but not at the Apollo.  In fact, I--I saw him in Austin, Texas a couple years ago.  But I can't, I mean, it was just, it was such a routine, it was no big deal to go to the Apollo, so we'd go and we'd sit in the second balcony, which were the cheap seats.
Speaker 1: Did they have 'Amateur Night' ['Amateur Night at the Apollo'] back at that time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they had a little guy named Puerto Rico that would come and shoot the people off the stage, a bad performance.  It was like 'American Idol' but with a little more finesse than 'American Idol.'
Speaker 1: Well, they did have the Sandman [Howard Sims] at that time, huh?
Speaker 2: No, a little guy called Puerto Rico (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Puerto Rico.
Speaker 2: --and I think he had a baby outfit on.  And he'd come out and chase them off.  I think that was Wednesday nights.
Story_ID: 597699
Speaker 1: Now, what about in--in school.  Usually, the field trips would always be to the Museum of Modern Art [New York, New York] and to the planetarium [Hayden Planetarium, New York, New York].  Did you make those trips?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Any stories about any of that?
Speaker 2: Not--not really.  I mean, we just did them and just taken them for granted, those were the trips you take.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What about Rockefeller Center [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Now, I--I probably went to Rockefeller Center as part of going to Radio City Music Hall with my family.  You know, with my brother [Clarence Adams, Jr.] or my sister [Marilyn Adams Moore] or somebody.  I remember getting lost at the Ma- mad at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, and that was kind of interesting 'cause a cousin took me and obviously he was in deep trouble for losing me (laughter).  And I--I went to the back--I went to the police and they got me squared away.  But--and of course, my cousin was well relieved.
Speaker 1: So, did he find you there or did they take you home (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The pol- came back to the police, he came down to the police station and got me.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the automat?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.  In fact, I remember eating in the au- automat with my father [Clarence Adams, Sr.] many times.  Yeah, you'd put your money in and you'd pull out your, yeah, that was a great, great experience.
Speaker 1: Any other experiences before we go further into college [New York University College of Engineering; New York University Tandon School of Engineering, Brooklyn, New York]?
Speaker 2: Not that I can think of.
Story_ID: 597700
Speaker 1: So, after your first year [at New York University College of Engineering; New York University Tandon School of Engineering, Brooklyn, New York] where you say you made a few mistakes, not going to class, what happens after that?
Speaker 2: After that I got pretty--got to be pretty--fairly sound academically.  And got involved with the--the fraternity crowds.  I pledged Sigma [Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity], but at one--but it got to a point where I said I wasn't gonna put up with that stuff.  So, all of us on the line quit except for one guy, Jimmy Walters [ph.], he stayed.  But--but I met some really good friends there.  Mainly why I picked Sigma was because my, my, my sister's [Marilyn Adams Moore] friends, a lot of her friends were Sigmas.  And she's si- six--was six years older than me.  And some of them really looked up to.  One guy was a student at--an engineering student at City College [City College of New York, New York, New York], another one was a--a premed.  And those fellows continue--you know, continued on and became physicians and--rather outstanding physicians in New York [New York].
Speaker 1: What were their names?
Speaker 2: Well, Bobby Gibbs [ph.] was one, Amos Charles [ph.] was a real charmer, very interesting guy who wound up being a banker I believe, but he was well known in New York.  He went to Hunter [Hunter College, New York, New York] and was known as a--to spend most of his time playing bid whist (laughter).  And then I got to know some of the basketball players because my buddy Billy [ph.], who I got in trouble with, was a basketball player and he wound up becoming ineligible, but they couldn't take his scholarship away (laughter), so he knew all the basketball.  So, Cal Ramsey [Calvin A. Ramsey] I got to know.  And then, Page, I have to say Page [ph.], a fellow who wound up being Sanders, Tom Sanders [Tom "Satch" Sanders] who wound up being a Boston Celtic and then--is now vice president in personnel for the NBA [National Basketball Association].  He grew up down the street from me.  So, I knew him.  And Russell Cunningham who played for NYU [New York University, New York, New York] and then wound being a principal [at P.S. 194, Countee Cullen School] in New York.  So, a lot of those fellows I got to know.  And then in--in New York, schools are because most students commute, all the fraternities in one night kind of have a wide draw.  So, we wound up with a lot of folks, a lot of parties and whatnot that was--so the whole fraternity crowd.  So, not belonging to a particular fraternity was not a detriment from, from a socialization point of view.
Story_ID: 597701
Speaker 1: So now your classes, what are you studying your second and third year (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I started off in aeronautical engineering and then I found out I was terrible at drawing.  In those days, I mean today it wouldn't make any difference 'cause they--you draw on the computer.  But I think the first thing is--when we--they gave us a plate and you had to do a mechanical drawing type thing.  And then the teacher would come by with a red pen and mark over your errors.  And then there was one where we had to do it in ink, which was absolutely horrible and I realized this was not the future for me.  In today's technology when you actually don't use a pencil and paper, when you can do it on a computer I think that would not have been an issue.  But I found out I couldn't do this.  I said, "I gotta switch."  So I switched to industrial engineering with aeronautical option.  And I did all right in the second year, and I did very well in the third and fourth year.  I'm trying to think of something else that I--that flashed across my mind in terms of, of my academics.  The one thing--one interesting thing, I noticed that almost all the teachers in the College of Engineering [New York University College of Engineering; New York University Tandon School of Engineering, Brooklyn, New York] wore brown.  And I got so curious I asked why.  Well, after the war, a lot of these colleges went out to get folks that worked in industry, particularly the technical types for faculty.  And they were--most of those at NYU [New York University, New York, New York] were from the rubber industry.  And in the rubber industry, they used to--I guess in the factories, they would have these dust particles that were floating around and they were brown.  So that's why these guys (laughter) wore brown all the time.
Story_ID: 597702
Speaker 1: So, you prepared to graduate from college [New York University College of Engineering; New York University Tandon School of Engineering, Brooklyn, New York], is that right. All right, and what year did you graduate?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-nine [1959].
Speaker 1: Okay. So, tell me what happens next?
Speaker 2: Well while I'm in college I'm working part-time.  And I'm working--well, I'll tell you the jobs I had during the summers.  One summer, oh I'll go back to I guess when I was fifteen, sixteen, I lied about my age and got a job as a counselor at a YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] camp.  Did very well until I had this one student--one camper whose mother neglected to tell us that he was an epileptic.  And this--we were sitting at the table and this kid goes into an epileptic fit.  And we--we managed it, but that was a real shocker for me.  And then, you know, why didn't the parents tell us 'cause we would've been able to deal with it a lot better.  But--and then we did certain things.  We would--I got involved with a group of pr- prankster counselors.  And there was one counselor who was actually a Boy Scout and we didn't have great admiration for scouts.  We, at one time, took his, his bunk and, and while he was out and put it in the middle of the lake (laughter).  Oh, that was--that was an interesting experience.  Then I had a job as an inspector for U.S. Time Corporation [Timex Group USA, Inc.] on displays.  Now, if you remember, there were displays where the Timex watch being hit by a hammer in a bowl of water, and I was inspector on those displays.
Story_ID: 597703
Speaker 1: You were talking about being an inspector for Time Corporation [U.S. Time Corporation; Timex Group USA, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: So I would sit at the end of the line and take them--make sure they worked.  It was a good job, it's a good summer job.  And then I went to work for (unclear) County Machine Company [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was a small operation, about maybe thirty employees.  And the man that ran it was a guy named Harold Levinson [ph.].  And I got to do everything in that--from purchasing to accounting to payroll, and I was doing that part time.  I'm trying to think if that was--I also had another part time job as a cashier for Sachs Quality Furniture store [Sachs Quality Furniture, Inc., New York, New York].  And then the thing I still remember from that is, I line up all my bills in my wallet the same way (laughter), and get frustrated if people hand them to me, if some cashier hands them to me like one upside down and one straight up.  So, I, I got that, that experience in the retail.
Speaker 1: Now, how old were you when you started--when you were at the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] camp, you said you lied about your age, how?
Speaker 2: I think at that time I was sixteen maybe.
Speaker 1: And then the inspector with the Time Corp?  This was--these were summer jobs?
Speaker 2: Those were summer jobs while I was in college [New York University College of Engineering; New York University Tandon School of Engineering, Brooklyn, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: So that was between my freshman and my junior--my freshman and my sophomore year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I went to work for County Machine, where I did some of everything.
Story_ID: 597704
Speaker 1: When I graduated, that was when I really got to know discrimination.  I remember when the company I subsequently worked for IBM [International Business Machines Corporation], interviewed me on campus [New York University College of Engineering; New York University Tandon School of Engineering, Brooklyn, New York].  The interviewer told me, quote, "You don't look like the marketing type to me or like the sales type to me."  It was just impossible to get employment.  But Harold Levinson [ph.] asked me to come full time with County Machine Company [ph.] and I did.  And so, I worked for him from 1959 to 1964, and got a real broad breadth of, of experience there.  Then, the Urban League [National Urban League] got, by the way, I applied to every--by including the Urban League.  But then there was Plans for Progress, where the first attempt at--at affirmative action with major companies.  And at that point in time I got a invitation to be interviewed by IBM.  And the same company that told me I didn't look like the sales type offered me--yes they interviewed me for office products sales job.  I did have this--this--this thing that I didn't want to leave New York City [New York, New York], okay.  And subsequently I realized that being an engineer that I had to be more flexible in wanting--who I wanted to be.
Story_ID: 597705
Speaker 1: You wanted to stay in New York City [New York, New York] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, well first I--I--not being negligent, I did marry my wife [Mary Louise Adams] in 1964.  But that--that comes after this so, I didn't--I didn't make a boo-boo there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I decided that--that I'd have to consider leaving New York.  And I got an interview with IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] and that resulted in them off--offering me a job in industrial engineering in Endicott, New York or in purchasing in Burlington, Vermont.  I saw Endicott, it was a company town.  I spoke to my fiancee at the time and she said, "No way."  So I chose to go to Burlington, Vermont.  So I got a job in Burlington, Vermont, seven hundred dollars a month, which in those days was a pretty good salary as an assistant buyer.  And about seven weeks after that, we got married and moved directly to Burlington, Vermont.
Story_ID: 597706
Speaker 1: Tell me how you met your wife?
Speaker 2: My good buddy, who went to Clinton High School [DeWitt Clinton High School, Bronx, New York], who lived in the apartment above me.  At that time, I was living at 200 West 90th Street.  And his--his--he was dating a woman who wound up being a next door neighbor to my wife who lived in the Bronx [New York].  And we--he said I want you to meet this woman.  So I went up and--I'll tell you some stories about him and not me that you'll find funny.  And we--I met this woman and I met her in January of 1964, we got married in November 21st of 1964.  And we've been married now for forty-two years is it.
Speaker 1: What is your wife's name?
Speaker 2: Mary Louise [Mary Louise Adams], oh now she goes by Mary Lou.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And her story is a fascinating one.  I don't know if you wanna hear it, but sometime I'll tell you that.
Speaker 1: Well, you can, you know, tell me.
Speaker 2: She was a stay at home mom while raising our three kids [Jennifer Adams Boutte, Edward Adams, Jr. and Michelle Adams Earley].  And during that time, she--she was a nurse and had graduated from Fordham nursing school [Fordham University, New York, New York], which was a diploma school.  And from--when we lived in Colorado, she started taking classes and when we got to Texas, she took classes and she wound up getting her master's [degree] or Ph.D., became a licensed nurse practitioner and she currently runs the--the nurse practitioner program at University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas].  So, it's--it's a interesting story.  So, we--we got married and she said, "Burlington [Vermont] is where we're gonna go."
Story_ID: 597707
Speaker 1: The whole Burlington [Vermont] experience was, was fascinating because in terms of African Americans, we had maybe fifty in town, in the whole town of Burlington.  And so there was no--there was no cultural ambience.  But we enjoyed it, because some of the blacks, folks that we met were really fascinating, I mean good people.  One was a fellow named H. Lawrence McCrorey who was a well known physiologist and did a lot of--of work on muscles.  And a lot of the research involved using pigs.  And we would have barbeques over at has house while the subjects after he has pulled whatever he wanted from them.  And he was really, really great experience and I think a great mentor for me because I would counsel with him.  I was, at one time, offered a job, a significant job at the IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] plant, at that time was a plant they were building in Brooklyn [New York].  And they wanted me to go down there to be the--the functional manager of procurement.  And he and I discussed it, and I said well if he doesn't--, "If I don't go, they'll get another black guy to do that job.  And if I go, they ain't gonna come back for me," (laughter), and so I declined the opportunity.  But he was a real great mentor and a great guy.
Story_ID: 597708
Speaker 1: Did I promise to tell you another story--
Speaker 2: About your friend?
Speaker 1: About my friend in the war.  Namar's name was Wylie Namar [ph.], N-A-M-A-R.  And we all called him Namar.  Subsequently when he became--when he got out of college he went to--when he started college, he switched to be called Wylie and as a small world, when I got to, to, to work in Colorado, many of the folks that I met were classmates of his at the University of Northern Colorado [Greeley, Colorado].  So that's a sign there's a small world out there.  Anyway, Namar and I, Namar was in high school and I was a freshman in college [New York University College of Engineering; New York University Tandon School of Engineering, Brooklyn, New York], and we would hit on my sister's [Marilyn Adams Moore] sorority sisters.  And what--and, and we would lie about our age and we would, I remember, he and I were dating two sisters, and they must've known that we were faking it, but we were faking and, and date these two girls.  It was--and I--to this day, I know they must've known, they couldn't have been that dumb.
Speaker 2: What does Namar do now?
Speaker 1: He's now retired, but he was a salesman also and he, he sold office equipment, and then he was selling vestments and whatnot to, to black churches.
Story_ID: 597709
Speaker 1: You and your wife are in Vermont and this is the height of the Civil Rights Movement--
Speaker 2: Yeah, height of Civil Rights Movement.  So--but we're isolated.  So everything we know about this--this happens in--we see on TV.  I remember when LBJ [President Lyndon Baines Johnson], that would've been his time, came to Burlington [Vermont] and it was an outdoor and he was presenting and Mary Lou [Mary Louise Adams] went into her purse for something, and five thousand [U.S.] Secret Service guys were like on her, you know.  But, but there was nothing--well I'll tell you what happened.  As a result of, of what was going on, we--me, Larry McCrorey [H. Lawrence McCrorey] and others were given invitations to come speak to these different groups.  So to that extent, we got involved and, and, and had to study up on what was going on and what were the issues and why what was going on was (unclear).  Of course, Vermont being quite liberal because they only had five hundred blacks in the whole state, you know, could be very liberal.  But that was--that--that was I think the extent.  We would get called to be, you know, the black spokesman for everything, you know.
Story_ID: 597710
Speaker 1: So, what happens after Vermont (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, we also, also while I'm there, IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] is very anxious to increase the, the number of blacks in the company employees.  So I would get requests to, to recruit.  So in addition to my regular job, which I'll tell you about later, I was very active in recruiting African Americans and was pretty successful.  I mean, it's not easy to get them to come to Vermont.  And in particular, I had some fellows from the Deep South, from Mississippi, and that's, that's a big change and, and they did well.  They did well.  And of course I was a mentor to them during that time.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of the, the recruits?  Do you remember any of their names and what they went on to do?
Speaker 2: Clarence Johnson [ph.], he wound up doing quality work and he was a quality manager at IBM in Princeton [New Jersey].  And he subsequently retired and now has two daycare centers in Raleigh [North Carolina].  Let's see who else I recruited.  Harry Pelser [ph.], he did well in IBM.  Let's see, Henry Joseph [ph.] who chose to follow his wife's career and she's an executive at the University of Arizona [Tucson, Arizona].  Gee, I can't think of any of them now, I'd have to go back, but there were several.
Speaker 1: Oka.  So, what happens next?
Speaker 2: Well, I think I told you that we--I also, also did a lot of internal work in IBM on affirmative action kind of stuff.
Story_ID: 597711
Speaker 1: I did not get involved in community stuff in Vermont, I was working so hard.  I think we started talking about my IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] career at that point (background noise).
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Affirmative action?
Speaker 2: The reason I chose to go to Burlington [Vermont] was at that time was just--the plant was just starting to grow and they had no technical people in purchasing.  So, I did and I think it was a good decision because I came in as assistant buyer and then six months later I was promoted to buyer, a year later I was promoted to buying manager.  And interestingly, the site industrial engineering manager, which was a third level manager was a fellow named Bill Ross [ph.].  And I was going to night school at University of Vermont [Burlington, Vermont] for a master's [degree] program.  And he was also in the class.  And when that job of the second level industrial engineering manager became available, he asked for me.  So, I went to work as a site industrial engineering manager, the second level manager's job.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it was a pretty, pretty good move for those years.  And at that time, the offer for Brooklyn [New York] came in and I declined that.
Story_ID: 597712
Speaker 1: Then, I was, was recruited by the vice president of manufacturing for the corporation, Bob Dunlap [Robert B. Dunlap], no that--that--no that was Sheldon Yur [ph.] to become administrative assistant to the vice president of manufacturing.  In those days, I think his title was IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] director of manufacturing.  But he was a corporate vice president over all manufacturing, which was really staff because the divisions had the line responsibilities, but he was responsible to oversee that for the corporation.  And in those days--today administrative assistant means secretary, but in those days administrative assistant, executive assistant were what they viewed as high potential executives going to work before an executive, and it's a grooming type position that usually doesn't last more than a year or a year and a half.  So, I gladly took that, go to corporate headquarters on the manufacturing staff.  And that experience for one year was great because--well a couple of the things happened.  About six months into the assignment, we, we do thin- things like do reports up to the corporate office on what's going on in manufacturing, corporation wise.  And I remember getting a letter from Tom Watson [Thomas Watson, Jr.], himself, telling me that he only has an A.B. from Brown [Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island] but he couldn't understand the gobbly-goop in the memo (laughter).  But that was a really interesting experience.  And--and about six months into the job, Dunlap--Sheldon Yur left to go to another assignment and Bob Dunlap became the director.  And he and I really bonded well.  He remember--I remember I used to drink my coffee with cream and he told me, "Don't you know black is beautiful?"  And now I drink my coffee black.
Story_ID: 597713
Speaker 1: And at that time I got to travel to Europe with him, travel in the company jet around to all the different plants [of the International Business Machines Corporation].
Speaker 2: Well, tell us some stories about that, there has to be some stories about traveling around in a jet?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, I was never a person to be impressed by stuff like that.  I mean, that's how you got to where you go because you had to do it in a certain time.  It wasn't anything that was luxurious, it was transportation.  We--I remember taking a train from Paris [France] to Montpellier [France] and staying awake all night 'cause it was the first time I've ever been on a train overnight; at first, I just could not sleep, I was so excited about it.  I remember going to Sweden, to Stockholm and, and having Swedish women coming over telling me wanted practice their English (laughter).  But those were--those were good, good experiences and I learned a lot about manufacturing and, and, and, and what was the different styles of management, et cetera.
Speaker 2: So, when you would take these trips, tell me what your--where's your assignment--what were you--actually can you give us more about what you actually did during those trips?
Speaker 1: Well, what we--what we would do is, is basically find out what their issues were, whether they were on target or not, were they meeting their goals.  And then I would be responsible for writing up a report on, on what went on.  What, you know, where they were in their sta- in what they were doing, et cetera.  It was really, I think, more to say, "Corporate is here to help you."  Did they have any issues that they wanted resolved?  Were the French getting on any better with the Germans? Because that was really, really bad blood.  So, we--you got to understand the dynamics of--in a meeting everybody is cordial and whatnot, but those World War II [WWII] animosities still, still existed.  And it was kind of fascinating to see how everybody got along in the meetings, but after the meetings were over, they didn't wanna do any touch--deal with each other, you know.  The English and the French were pretty compatible, you know, but they kind of isolated the Germans.  So I got--that was--that was I think a really interesting experience.  And I did that, I made one trip with Bob Dunlap [Robert B. Dunlap] to, to Europe.  But, but back in the states the, the, the interesting thing was just find out what was going on.  And we visited a lot of states, a lot of pla- a lot of plants in the United States, you know, from Raleigh [North Carolina] to San Jose [California].
Story_ID: 597714
Speaker 1: What happened after that was, I was selected to go to the Stanford Sloan executive program [Sloan Master's Program; Stanford MSx Program] at Stanford University [Stanford Graduate School of Business, Stanford, California].
Speaker 2: How--what about the Vietnam War, before you go into that?
Speaker 1: Oh (laughter).  In 196- no let's say '64 [1964], '65 [1965] I was called.  I was living in Vermont and I got my notice from the draft board to report for a physical at Albany, New York and they had transportation available (laughter).  And I went and Mary Lou [Mary Louise Adams] was pregnant at the time and I--well, no first of all, when, when I was working at County Machine Company [ph.] I got a deferment because I was doing defense work.  So, I didn't have to go.  Not even--I didn't even have to take a physical.  But when I changed jobs, at that time I'm twenty-six years old and the draft is supposed to end at twenty-six, evidently these folks didn't get the message, 'cause they called me for a physical.  I went down to Albany, got the physical and copped a plea that my wife was pregnant and they let me slide.  So, that essentially was, was the break I got (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 597715
Speaker 1: So, now on to the Sloan executive [Sloan Master's Program; Stanford MSx Program]?
Speaker 2: So, now this is 197--
Speaker 1: Three [1973]?
Speaker 2: Three [1973].  And we moved out, the whole family moved for one year, we closed up our house in Colorado.  Well we didn't close it up, actually we befriended several graduate students in Boulder [Colorado]--did we get to Boulder yet?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: No we were in Vermont.  How did we get--how do we go get to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, because you got me into civil rights.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, now where we?  We're in Vermont and now we got to get to Boulder, right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay, so from Vermont I go to--let's see, Vermont to Armonk [New York] corporate headquarters, they got me there right.  And then I get a job as the plant manager of a tape manufacturing plant in Boulder, Colorado with IBM [International Business Machines Corporation].  And we moved to Boulder.  And the, the--so that's 1970 I guess.  At Boulder, we get involved with the University of Colorado's program where they're trying to get black students to recruit them and retain them.  And so they asked different African American families in the community (background noise).
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: All right, go ahead.
Speaker 1: Well while in Boulder, we got involved with the programs at University of Colorado [University of Colorado Boulder, Boulder, Colorado] to help retain black students.  And we were assigned two kids.  One was a boy that lived in Denver [Colorado] and the other was a sixteen year old, fifteen year old in fact girl from Marianna, Arkansas named Iris Jane Cole [ph.].  And we just bonded with her and she bonded with us, and she would spend all her weekends with us.  And she did some babysitting for us.  She--and when we left to go to--to Stanford [Stanford Graduate School of Business, Stanford, California], her parents drove all the way out from Marianna, Arkansas just to tell us thanks.  She subsequently worked for IBM, holds a pretty good position now in Atlanta [Georgia], and she is one of my grandkids' godmother.  So that was a really good community experience in Boulder.  In Boulder, we also got involved with a group of African American students that came up to get--yeah with the school integration thing going on, they wanted to get the black administrators up to date with graduate degrees so they could be competitive in this integrated thing from all over the South.  And so, we got to be friends with all of those kids and we--we'd party together.  And I had a friend by the name of, of Fred Robinson [ph.] who was dating one of those girls, so that's how we got involved in--in this--with them.  And I think it was a--it was a really good group and what--subsequently when we--when we went for that one year at Stanford, we had those girls housesit, two of those girls housesit for us so we didn't have to close down the house or anything.  They, they lived rent free for a year in our house.

Speaker 1: Tell me, what year did you get your master's [degree]?
Speaker 2: I didn't get a master's, I got a Sloan certificate [from the Stanford Graduate School of Business, Stanford, California] in 1974, and I'll tell you about that in a minute.
Speaker 1: Okay, because you said you were going to night school for your master's, right?
Speaker 2: Oh I was going, yeah.  Well, all those, every place I worked I'd go--I would go to night school to work on a master's (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And your son is born or daughter, which one is born?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 1970--oh it's 1968, '68 [1968], '67 [1967].  On March 21st, my daughter is born, Jennifer [Jennifer Adams Boutte], our first daughter.  And Teddy [Edward Adams, Jr.] was born on December 12th of '68 [1968].  So, those are my two Vermont kids.  Now, going back to, to, to Boulder [Colorado], I le- my job in Boulder was managing a tape manufacturing facility and I was at a, a, a--division of IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] called information records division or supplies division.  Everybody else in the--in the division made IBM cards.  Yeah, you remember--I don't know if you remember there were cards.  To, to get a computer to operate they had these stacks of cards and they would key punch the cards so that what would happen, if the data came in, they'd enter the data by key punching the cards and then the computer would read the cards or a card reader would read the data off these cards where the holes were.  Our technology has really moved significantly through--since those days.
Speaker 1: Before you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But they made cards.
Story_ID: 597717
Speaker 1: The division that I worked in at IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] was a supplies division.  And so we would--I was the only plant that didn't make IBM cards.  And my products were floppy disks and computer tape.  And it was a real interesting experience because it was really a chemical processing situation.  We would make the ink and we would coat the ink on essentially a polyester substrate.  And then we'd bring it, cure it and then convert it into one and a half inch wide tape and test it.  And that was my responsibility.  And we just had great performance, outstanding performance, enough to get my wife [Mary Louise Adams] and I a trip to Europe.  And of course we had to visit the different, different plants as part of it.  So, we got to go together to Copenhagen [Denmark] and Rome [Italy] and Paris [France], and Stuttgart [Germany].  And part of that performance was such that I got to be a Sloan fellow.  And the Sloan executive program [Sloan Master's Program; Stanford MSx Program] is where companies pay, I don't know what they pay now, but at that time it was a lot of bucks [dollars] to Stanford [Stanford Graduate School of Business, Stanford, California].  And we had a class of forty-one executives from all over the world.  And we st- I still stay in contact with, with some of them.  One fellow was an executive with Boeing [The Boeing Company], Joe Madden and he and I are pretty--we stay in contact.  There's another fellow who was at the time with Lockheed [Lockheed Corporation; Lockheed Martin] named Barry Brook [ph.] and he just inundates my email with jokes, but a really nice guy.  So, that was--that was a great experience for, for not only me, but the program is such that the families are involved, so the wives got to be really good friends too.  And so that one year timeframe, they developed a lot of great friends.  Now, what happened in that program, when I went there it was a non-degree program.  Subsequently, they have made it a degree program where they give a master's degree in business.  But we--that was a fantastic experience that very few people in this world get to do.  There's a program at Stanford and there's one at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  So after one year of that, we came back to, to Boulder [Colorado] and after that I was offered--well that was an interesting--that's when I, I, I, I--what they had to do was place me, see 'cause there's no job, right.  And that's when I think the prejudice became apparent.
Speaker 2: Now, you were--you are with IBM for a number of years (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm still with--yeah I did thirty-six years with IBM.
Speaker 2: Yeah, for--but I'm--at this point you were there for a number of years?
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Story_ID: 597718
Speaker 1: Before you go on, did you wanna talk more about the Sloan program [Sloan Master's Program; Stanford MSx Program]?  You said the families were involved and the type of program that it was, can you give me more description of what the program was like?
Speaker 2: The program was forty-one people, in fact we had two women.  Most of the people were sponsored by corporations.  So, there was one, one fellow from General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company] who subsequently became a, a significant guy with Toyota [Toyota Motor Corporation] (laughter), Boeing [The Boeing Company].  There was a Israeli banker from Israel.  There was a Japanese technology guy.  There was a diplomat who subsequently was one of those captives in Iran named Morefield [Richard Morefield].  There was an Episcopal priest.  A fellow from Lockheed [Lockheed Corporation; Lockheed Martin].  But there were forty-one of a broad range of both from government, business and around the world, and they all had their families with them, with maybe one or two exceptions, but basically they all had their families.  And they all, you know, rented quarters in the--in the Palo Alto [California] area, all company paid expense while continuing their salaries, of course.  And what we would do, most things together.  We'd take our classes together and it was all M.B.A. classes, which drove the professors kind of batty.  I know, some of them liked teaching us and some didn't, because you teach these experienced people like us and then you teach new M.B.A.'s, you know.  We saw some flaws in some of their reasoning (laughter) and we--we'd jump on them about it.  We start off with--we started off with a retreat, though just the students at a, a place that Pacific Gas and Light [sic. Pacific Gas and Electric Company] had in the country.  Then we would do--we do our classes together and then we have social things like wine tastings and that sort of thing.  And then the, the folks that felt compatible with each other would hang out together, I mean just bond.  And then we, as part of the program, we, we got to visit different companies.  We had an eastern trip where we went to Washington [D.C.] and met with some senators and whatnot.  So--and then we also had a trip where we got to meet with Ronald Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan], who at that time was governor of California.  So, it was a really broad based program that's still going on today and it's much more expensive today than it was then.
Story_ID: 597719
Speaker 1: So, you go back to?
Speaker 2: So, now is--now I finished the program and I got replaced.  And that's the time when I find that it's evidently much more difficult to place me then it has been to others who have been in the Sloan program [Sloan Master's Program; Stanford MSx Program].  And what they decide to do was send me back to Boulder [Colorado] in what was essentially my old job [at International Business Machines Corporation].  And then, this is 1974, and in 1975 they offer me the job as plant manager, office products division plant manager in Austin [Texas].  So, I come here in the plant manager's job, 'cause the plant's growing, I mean, and the plant manager's job had responsibility for quality, materials, manufacturing, but not engineering.  So, that's another thing that made me suspect that there may have been some racism involved.  About two years later I finally got engineering, or manufacturing, engineering, I should say.  But that was a, a very interesting experience.  We got to manufacture, at that time, memory typewriters and some equipment that, golly, you wouldn't even know what it was today, but all kinds of office products.  The predecessors to the personal computers and even subsequently, we did even make some personal computers in, in that facility.  And we made the display writer, which had a real wide--big screen, and folks were hoping--the designers said that people would not want to scroll down, they would not want a small screen, which obviously is quite different today, right.  And during that time, I, I was plant manager for five years and then in--and I'd made it known that I really liked Austin and it would be very difficult for me to move.  So, I was made the site operations manager, which had responsibility for, for all of the things other than manufacturing.  So, I had facilities, I had information systems, all those operations.  That was--and that was a good experience.
Story_ID: 597720
Speaker 1: All this time, I--I've--was very much involved in the community as you could see from, from my resume.
Speaker 2: Well, tell me about some of them, your community involvement?
Speaker 1: My community involvement?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well let's see where I can start.  I was one of the organizers of the Austin Area Urban League [Austin, Texas].
Speaker 2: What year was this?
Speaker 1: Let's see (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, if you can't remember, that's fine.
Speaker 1: I wanna--I think--I, I can look that up for you, but whatever and they just had an anniversary, I can't remember which one it was.  But I got--I got really involved in the--in, in, in bringing Urban--Urban League to Austin [Texas].  And we did it.  And it's a really successful organization now and I'm still involved and, you know, they bring the old presidents back.  So, I became president of the league at one point.  And they still involve us--prior presidents to the extent they can.  And we just--in fact, there was a selection committee for their chief executive officer and we picked a really good one, a fellow named Jeffrey Richards.  So I did to the Urban League.  I--I also was involved in a lot of lobbying.  And I, I, I started getting an interest in healthcare, and I was appointed to be on the board of our city hospital at the time, Brackenridge Hospital [Central Health Brackenridge Campus, Austin, Texas], and was very much involved in that operation and became chairman of the board of, of Brackenridge.
Speaker 2: What, what got you involved in healthcare?
Speaker 1: You know, I, I, I often think maybe it's because of my wife [Mary Louise Adams] being a nurse and maybe I was trying to compete with her (laughter) a little bit, I don't know.  But I, I, I really don't know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But--so, I, I did the Brackenridge thing.  And one interesting experiences there was we ran across a accreditation issue and had to go to the joint commission in--in Chicago [Illinois] to tell them what we're gonna do about it so they wouldn't give us a bad sanction.  And it's the coldest I've ever been in my life was in Chicago in January.  And whatever that main street is, what is it called, Michigan Avenue?  And I lived in Vermont, which gets awful cold, nothing like Chicago.  So, that's, that's one of my interesting memories of my volunteer work.  Gee, I, I, I have done so much I can't re- I'm trying to remember all of them.  I was with the chamber of commerce [Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce].  I did a lot of work with the chamber of commerce.  Became vice president for government affairs and that's when I started developing my lobbying and government affairs skills.  And with the chamber, we've actually got to take a--I don't--if that was the same time, but we got involved a lot with, with the city council [Austin City Council].  So, I was--I was very--I developed a lot of friends that were politicos as a result.
Story_ID: 597721
Speaker 1: --The director of Texas Taxpayers and Research Association [Austin, Texas]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we--that was a lobbying organization called the Texas Taxpayer and Research League [ph.], and Texas Te- pax- taxpayers league.  And that was a--a business organization that was devoted to keeping taxes low for corporations.  And so I did a lot of work with them.  I was also very, very much involved in education and I became was, was Ann Richards, Governor Ann Richards, appointed me to the Texas technology college system [Texas State Technical College] board of regents.  I was on that board for six years, and one of those years as chair.
Speaker 1: And there was something about Texas broadcasting?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Well, I was also on the board of our public service--public broadcasting system station here, KLRU [KLRU-TV, Austin, Texas], which is real fascinating enterprise.  And was involved in, as a board member, in raising money for the station and getting corporate support for it.
Speaker 1: And?
Speaker 2: And then the Austin Project [Austin, Texas], I guess, gave, gave both my wife [Mary Louise Adams] and I an award for our efforts in the community and for things that affect children as volunteers.  And so those were things I did in the early days.  And since I retired, I'm still involved in a--in a few things.  One is--it was--Governor Perry [Rick Perry] appointed me twice now to the Texas Workforce Investment Council, which used to be known as some long name Texas Council and economic and blah, blah, blah, blah [Texas Council on Workforce and Economic Competitiveness].  But now it's been streamlined to investment council.  What we do is oversee all of the workforce programs in Texas, particularly those which are funded through federal money and the federal law requires that there be such a--such a board.  So, I've been on that now for, oh seven, eight years now.  I'm also on the board of the Northwest Austin--North Austin Medical Center [St. David's North Austin Medical Center, Austin, Texas], which is one of the--part of the St. David's healthcare system, which is real complicated organization.  But it's partially owned by Hospital Corporation of America, and I chair that board.
Story_ID: 597722
Speaker 1: So we stopped at 1985, near the--
Speaker 2: Okay, so I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) you, yeah, 1985 you go--now, at this point, you're the director of site operations [for the International Business Machines Corporation]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and then you go to--tell me what happens next?
Speaker 2: Now I'm still in--I'm still in Boulder [Colorado] and then--
Speaker 1: No, you're in--in Austin [Texas].
Speaker 2: I'm still in Austin, I'm still in Austin.  And then it's 1990--
Speaker 1: Well, 1985 to '96 [1996] aren't you the manager of the external programs?
Speaker 2: Oh okay, ninety--or--what--yeah, '96 [1996].  They decide that I've been doing so wonderfully with, with the government, et cetera, and I'm blocking (laughter) the movement of somebody else into that job.  So, they make me the manager of external programs.  And there I start--I do all of the external community relations, communications that--for the site.  And I don't--I can't remember how many--how many years I did that.
Story_ID: 597723
Speaker 1: So then subsequently, there's a big reorganization and people report no, no longer in the site and they start--I, I can't--wh- what was the next job?
Speaker 2: Regional manager of corporate comm- communications [sic. regional manager of corporate community relations].
Speaker 1: Okay, then we decide that we're gonna go with a new organization where the position that I had reporting locally would report to the IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] director of community relations in Armonk [New York].  So I go to work for Stan Litow [Stanley S. Litow] and I have now responsibility for government relations for--and community relations for all of our plants in the West.  So now I have responsibilities in San Jose [California]; Tucson [Arizona]; Rochester, Minnesota; Austin [Texas] and Boulder, Colorado.  And that's, that's an interesting experience 'cause you're going through a whole culture (background noise)--.  So, this is going through a real culture change.  'Cause first all your--all these folks were reporting locally before, now they're reporting to me, who I, in turn, reports to corporate headquarters.  And some don't like the new world and my boss knows it.  And so now we get into this thing of straightening him out, either get him on board or get rid of him kind of thing.  So, that was a good experience.
Story_ID: 597724
Speaker 1: We're still in the '90s [1990s] I think.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: In 2000, I'm asked to go to South Africa to help them on their community relations programs and to bring some of the programs that IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] had in the United States to see if they were feasible to do in South Africa and to do them.  So, I went over to South Africa and consulted with them.  That was a really, really great experience, 'cause I got to go to places that tourists don't go.
Speaker 2: So tell me about the experience?
Speaker 1: Well, I'll tell you, I've never seen so much poverty.  And see kids that--the big problem is getting them food so they can perform in school.  You go into the townships and the streets aren't paved and there are no street signs to tell you where you are.  A lot of h- holdovers, even though it became essentially a new country, but in 1994 there's a lot--a lot of work to be done.  I got to, to meet a lot of people.  I got to meet a, a Anglo guy who was telling me that--that his company is making a lot of money giving training programs to, to corporations because they lose people so fast to AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome].  Every Saturday somebody going to a funeral.  So, there- there's some problems.  But there's some bright spots too.  There--there's a really emerging middle, middle class and upper middle class, a lot of black owned businesses, a lot of blacks doing very, very well.  But in--from the business world and the corporate world, you don't see it very much of it.  One of the pleasures I got in, in, in traveling to South Africa was to see a, a man who used to work at IBM, could not go home because if he got home he'd be put in jail because he's one of those student protestors back in the days of the struggle.  And he has si- since returned to South Africa and I got to visit with him.  The--I got to an IBM--African IBMer that I got to, to work with, Alfred Mandeo [ph.].  Really showed me the roots, showed me, you know, what was going on there.  And we had some, some real successes.  We put in a program where we put computers that were child, that were child--configured for children.  A program called KidSmart [KidSmart Early Learning Program] and we put that in several schools in South Africa and got some, some really good results of this as a result of it.  But it was--it was--I, I, I traveled over there, even after I retired, they hi- hired me as a consultant and I did that work until 2003.  Took my wife [Mary Louise Adams] over on one trip and so she got to enjoy it a lot more than I did, because you know, when you're over there you're working.  I subsequently got to meet Bishop Tutu [Desmond Tutu], actually I met him in New York [New York] at a--at a banquet and had dinner with him, and so I sat at the table with him.  So, that was--that was a great situation.  Dealt with a lot of the government people in South Africa.  They, the government tends to be very much black and Indian, a lot of Indians in the--in the senior management positions in government.  A lot of--I think they may still be using punch cards in some of those areas, I mean the backward technology, it's amazing.  But it was--it was an interesting experience.
Story_ID: 597725
Speaker 1: What other countries did you visit, while--you know, even on vacation that were (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh golly, well most recently--while, while at work IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] I visited I think, well I told you about the one, about Stockholm [Sweden], right, so that was that trip I took with Dunlap [Robert B. Dunlap].  We subsequently I've been to, course I've been to Barbados, Trinidad [Republic of Trinidad and Tobago].  Oh let's see, never been in Hawaii, Japan and Asia.  Let's see, Barbados, I just--we went to the Netherlands most recently.
Speaker 1: How was that trip?
Speaker 2: That was good because that was on my own.  I mean, I didn't have to do any work.  That--that was a fascinating place to visit.  The freedom, the sexual freedom was amazing.  You know, go down the street where they have the prostitutes in the window and all these places where they--the bars or smoke shops where, you know, they have hashish and pot to smoke, it's fascinating.
Speaker 1: It's very different.
Speaker 2: And we were there on the queen's [Beatrix Wilhelmina Armgard] birthday, which is one big festival day.  I mean, everything shuts down for partying, and so it was--it was a really big party day, and it's, it's fascinating.
Story_ID: 597726
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety-nine [1999], Governor George Bush [President George Walker Bush] appoints you to the council?
Speaker 2: Workforce Investment Council [Texas Workforce Investment Council].
Speaker 1: Okay, tell me about that?
Speaker 2: Oh that's a program that oversees the workforce programs in Texas.  So, you know, the federal government sends money down for various workforce development programs and they wanna make sure that there's a system in place to see that it's managed well.  So they put that on the governor and then the governor appoints what's called a workforce investment board in some states, or investment council in some states, to perform that task for him.  So, that agency comes--does report to on the state of the workforce in Texas.  They do a report annual on welfare to work, how that's going.  And report on the performance of the whole system.  So, in that system we got about ten agencies that are all involved with wors- with workforce and we sort of oversee them and combine them of all for reporting purposes.
Story_ID: 597727
Speaker 1: I got very much involved in education from a political point of view and was one of the founders of an organization which is still existing and has expanded called the Texas Business and Education Coalition.  And we got some significant businessmen and women to, to fund this organization in its early years.  And basically what that organization did was work to get, get business support for education reform that would assure that we would get students performing to acceptable standards and deal with such issues as the gap between minority and, and students, minority and majority students.  And that was an organization that we got involved in.  And then, I became president of a co- an organization called Texans for Education [sic. Texans for Education Opportunity] which was the direct lobbying effort.  And collected money from corporations into that entity to be used for education reform efforts.  Meanwhile, I was serving on the board of Huston-Tillotson College [Huston-Tillotson University, Austin, Texas] and was chairman of that board at one time.  And two years ago, I resigned from the board after twenty-one years of service.  And they were kind enough to, to grant me one of their prestigious awards called the Golden Man Award [ph.].
Speaker 2: And, and did you not get your honorary doctorate? Is that the same thing?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was--that was back in, I guess in the '80s [1980s], that Huston-Tillotson gave me an honorary doctorate.
Story_ID: 597728
Speaker 1: You were involved also in--you never pledged a fraternity, but you do belong to an organization?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity] is an interesting--in Austin [Texas] is an interesting situation.  We had two men who were in Austin who were members of the Boule.  One had moved from Long Island [New York], a gentleman by the name of Milton Fleming who is now deceased.  Former [U.S.] military officer and an epidemiologist I guess by, by training.  And John Q. Taylor King, Sr. who was a one time president of Huston-Tillotson College [Huston-Tillotson University, Austin, Texas] was a general in the United States Army Reserve.  A man of, of great distinction.  And he was a member of Nu Boule in Houston, Texas and he got tired of commuting down there for meetings.  And so the two of them decided that they should form a Boule in Austin.  And so they asked several of the--of the men here in town that they thought would make good members to, to join.  So, we joined.  I served one time, you know, we have our presidential, what we call sire archon who was the local president for every--for two year assignments, and I did serve a two year assignment as sire archon of the Boule here.
Speaker 1: Good.
Speaker 2: And we, we look forward toward the regional and the national conventions which are always with good experiences.

Speaker 1: Your children are grown now, so tell me about--about your children?
Speaker 2: Jennifer, whose name is now Jennifer Boutte [Jennifer Adams Boutte] who lives in Smyrna, Georgia.  She is--got a civil engineering degree from Texas A&M [Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas] and a master's in environmental engineering from University of Texas [University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas].  Worked for a little while as a environmental engineer, got married, became a stay at home mom, which she is doing now.  And she married a fellow from Lake Charles, Louisiana named Brian Boutte who is an executive now at--in marketing at General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company].  And they have two children, a boy and Matthew [Matthew Boutte] is nine, and a girl, Marilyn [Marilyn Boutte] who is six.  And then Teddy [Edward Adams, Jr.], who was born in 1968, he is a partner in the law firm of Fulbright and Jaworski [Fulbright and Jaworski LLP].  Got his undergraduate degree at Rice [Rice University, Houston, Texas] and he got his law degree at Stanford Law School [Stanford, California].  And still single and doing quite well.  He lives in Houston [Texas].  And Michelle [Michelle Adams Earley], who lives here in Austin [Texas], she is an attorney.  She graduated from Texas A&M and subsequently went to Yale Law School [New Haven, Connecticut].  And she is now a senior associate lawyer at Liddell Sapp law firm [Locke Liddell and Sapp PLLC; Locke Lord LLP] here in Austin.  She is married to Billy Earley [William Earley] who is a, a teacher--a fifth grade teacher at Laurel Mountain School [Laurel Mountain Elementary School, Austin, Texas] in the Round Rock School District [Round Rock Independent School District].  She has two girls, Addison [Addison Earley] who is four years old and Campbell [Campbell Earley] who is twenty months.  And so we get to see them often.  In fact, my wife's [Mary Louise Adams] babysitting them this evening, so.
Speaker 1: Okay. Is there anything that we missed that you would like to talk about?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I can't think of much.
Story_ID: 597730
Speaker 1: When you look back over your life, is there anything that you might have done differently?
Speaker 2: You know, I, I, I--sometimes I think about that and I really don't know.  I had one, one tragedy in my--in my life when my house burned down.  That was in 1995.  I was at a reception for the university that was--it was at the university chancellor's house and George Foreman was a guest.  And people were lining up to take their picture with George Foreman.  And I was next in line and someone tapped me on the--one of the security people tapped me on the shoulder and said, "You Ed Adams [HistoryMaker Edward Adams]?"  I said, "Yeah."  He said, you know, "Call your office, your house is on fire."  And we subsequently got up there and it was on this site, and flames were going all over the place and it was the windiest day of the year.  And from the canyon in the back, all this wind was coming and the house burnt down.  And we lost the dog, and fortunately nobody was home.  But, that's one heck of an experience to go through.  But, we learned a lot from it.  We learned how folks that we didn't think were close to us, just came through with all kinds of support.  Not only from our church, but, but elsewhere.  I, I didn't tell you about my church involvement (laughter) but--
Speaker 1: Well, you still--you still can tell me about it.
Speaker 2: But that experience, I probably would never have known how much we were loved had that not happened.  So it was a mixed bag.  But it really--it was a traumatic experience for both of us.

Speaker 1: I'm an Episcopalian and have been one since I was a little kid.  My wife's [Mary Louise Adams] an Episcopalian and we belong to a church in Austin [Texas] called St. James' Episcopal Church which is a--has a very interesting background.  Because this was a black church that has become now predominantly white.  And you don't--you have, you usually have the opposite, the white church becomes black.  So it's a really fascinating church that is setup as an example for the whole world.  And we got--the interesting thing there, we have a lot of black folks in it concerned about it becoming so white and we got some white folks that are concerned about being so white.  But we got a, a commitment all the way down the line that we're gonna keep that African American heritage.  So I got involved, I was senior warden at one time.  I was involved in the diocese.  I was elected to the executive board of the Diocese of Texas [Episcopal Diocese of Texas] and served on that for a three year term.  And our church is growing fantastically.  We're go--we're building a new, new, new church as we speak.  And now our concern is that our rector is being interviewed for a bishop job all over the country.  So we're finally gonna lose him, but--
Speaker 2: Who, who is he?
Speaker 1: Greg Richert--Rickel [Greg Rickel].
Speaker 2: Rickel?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  In fact, he's a candidate now for bishop of Olympia, Washington.  So he'll be on their board for the--for their elections gonna take place in May.

Speaker 1: Two questions; one, do you know how the church [St. James' Episcopal Church, Austin, Texas] became--how it went from being black to, to white, was it a change in the community, the neighborhood?  Do you have an understanding of how that occurred?
Speaker 2: Now, what happened, there're a couple of things that happened that--that--we do a--first of all, black Episcopalians in this part of the world are very, very few.  So, it's difficult to get--to recruit blacks.  And, and our, our best chance is you get a Catholic married to a Baptist, then you know, you got a good chance of recruiting them.  But generally, we lose out to the Methodist and the, the Methodist and the Baptist.  It's just the way it is in this part of the world.  So recruiting blacks is very difficult.  Now blacks from the Caribbean, no problem or blacks from--from Africa, no problem.  We get--we get--we can get those and we do have many of them.  But it's very difficult.  So you got that difficulty.  And then what happened is, we got a few Anglos came over and those were some that I think even folks that felt a little guilt from back in the days and they want to bond with--and there were some that really enjoyed the church and the music.  And so and they started telling their friends and (laughter) friends, a lot of them transferred from other Episcopal churches and this grew and grew.  Now, we also, at that point, had a rector who was outreaching into the community and, and he attracted a lot of people.  So, and then Greg [Greg Rickel] has done-- Greg's been here five years, he's done a fantastic job, and they keep coming.  We got a Hispanic service now that we--that he started.  But the church, it's, it's just grown.  And folks like the service and we keep the African American stuff in front of them, so.

Speaker 1: You mentioned that you were a senior warden, what, what--?
Speaker 2: That's like the head of the vestry, the head of the--in the Episcopal church you have a board at each church which is called the vestry.  And the head of the vestry or like the chairman of the board of it is called the senior warden.
Speaker 1: And what are their responsibilities?
Speaker 2: Well everything on--from the business point of view of the church.  And they have to approve all the programs, the budget, the, the rector's salary, appoint the various committees and just run the business of the church.  And then the executive board is really the--for the diocese and the Diocese of Texas [Episcopal Diocese of Texas] covers all the Episcopal churches in the western part of Texas from Austin [Texas]--of the eastern part of Tex- what--from the eastern part of Texas from Austin, to the Louisiana border.  And the executive board is sort of--is the business board for the diocese.  And you get elected at the annual convention for a three year term and then.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. When Katrina [Hurricane Katrina] happened, did some of the folks from Louisiana come here and join the church [St. James' Episcopal Church, Austin, Texas] or enter into the community?
Speaker 2: They entered--they didn't join the church, but they--
Speaker 1: Oh they didn't?
Speaker 2: --did enter the community with the church.  And what, what they--the church got involved in making donations to them and, and giving clothing and furniture and whatever we could to them.  And this was a group of Katrina people that were in a car--apartment complex in East Austin [Austin, Texas] that the church adopted.  A couple of them came to church a couple of times and I guess it wasn't their thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They didn't like all that kneeling I guess (laughter).

Speaker 1: You talked about what you wouldn't change.  Is there anything that you have not done that you still want to do?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, golly.
Speaker 1: What are some of those things?
Speaker 2: Well, I would--I would've liked to learn to play an instrument.  I think I'm gonna get to do that one day.  I'm a big jazz fan.  I have a rather large collection.
Speaker 1: Who do you collect?
Speaker 2: Oh golly, I got John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Jackie McLean, Michelle--oh golly, I can't--I'll think of them, Jacques Lesure, Bill Evans, Clifford Brown, Max Roach.  And then, you know, singers, Carmen McRae, I'm a big Carmen McRae fan.  Of course, Ella Fitzgerald.  Yeah, I've got--I've got a massive collection.
Speaker 1: So you wanna, what instrument--
Speaker 2: In fact, I have--
Speaker 1: --what instrument would you like to play?
Speaker 2: Well, at my age I probably have to wind up to--playing guitar or something like that.  I ca- I don't think I could play saxophone.  I don't have the wind for it, you know.  That I'd like to do.  What else have I not done? I regret not having taken up golf at a younger age.  But again, that would have conflicted with my time I'm sure.  But, I play golf now, and not very well, so I kind of figure if I'd taken it up at a younger age I'd play better.
Speaker 1: Do you play with John Butler [HistoryMaker John S. Butler]?
Speaker 2: No, John's good, (unclear).  I play--we have a foursome, all retired guys, three--two of who are in the Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity] are beside me, Pearl Hancock [ph.], I told you about, Harold Bowen [ph.] who is a retired [U.S.] military guy and engineer who is one of the biggest boosters that Hampton University [Hampton, Virginia] has ever had.  He really, really works hard for Hampton.  And a fellow named of Lorenzo Fitzpatrick who is retired from, from state government.  And so every Tuesday and sometimes if we can get another day squeezed in, we'll play golf.
Speaker 1: Okay, anything else?
Speaker 2: Ah, let's see what else would I've like to have done?  I think travel more.  I think when Mary Lou [Adams' wife, Mary Louise Adams] retires, which she keeps telling me is next year, next year, we'll do some more traveling.  That's--I think that's about those few things I regret not doing.

Speaker 1: Now, because this information will be available for the future generations, what message would you like to send to the future generations?
Speaker 2: I think the first thing is that the world is changing so fast that if you ever go, don't be deterred to think that--that those things which are or appear to be obstacles won't be there.  I, I, I would guarantee that those obstacles won't be there you know, ten, fifteen years out.  And too often, young people decide they're gonna major something in college because it's a hot thing today, but they really want to do something else.  And the world changes, and, and they need to understand that and not give up on, on goals.  I also found that the most important thing is to be happy in what you do and enjoy what you do.  I saw where, where several executives have gotten really good jobs in my company [International Business Machines Corporation] and other companies, and to do that they sacrificed their families and their kids, and that to me is not an option.  I'll tell you an interesting story, when I was in Boulder [Colorado], I went out to pick up a corporate senior vice president and group executive at the airport, he came in his private jet.  And you know, we ran out and I went to greet him and there's his bag and I said, "Spike [ph.] I would take your bag for you, but it would set our equal opportunity back ten years," (laughter).  He didn't find it funny.  I think that had some, some consequences for me through, through the years.  But I had--I had a friend, and I don't know if this exists today, I had a friend by the name of Cody Laday [ph.] who's somebody you ought to talk to in Dallas [Texas], who was the vice president--regional vice president for Xerox Corporation.  And he told me about Xerox's effort in those days to get more blacks into senior management positions and how they had to do things like tell these guys that it's nothing wrong with saying sir to the white man and you're not humbling yourself by doing that.  And, and, and what happens is, I've seen and, and, and people have to decide this for themselves.  You see behaviors of, of, of executives or high potential people that are ambitious where they do things which we would construe as Uncle Tom-ing.  So what you do, you wind up as a black guy saying, "I ain't gonna do that stuff because that's Uncle Tom-ing," but the white guy's doing that.  And, and you have to make up your own mind about that.  I took the position that I would not do that.  And sometimes when we--you, you realize when you don't do it, you know, the consequences are that, you know, you're not gonna advance as much as your potential is.  And I don't know if today I would say, "Oh that they do it too, so I'm gonna do it."  But my psyche at the time was that, I wasn't gonna do that.  But in, in, in, in retrospect and in current views, that's one thing I would, would advise youngsters to do today.  Those who are wanting to be upwardly mobile.

Speaker 1: What advice do you have for students or, or college graduates coming out of college and looking for a position say in an IBM [International Business Machines Corporation] setting or Xerox [Xerox Corporation]?  Do you have any advice?
Speaker 2: Well, I'd, I'd like to give the advice before they graduate from college.  I think--I think, you know, no matter what they gotta get good grades and have some--a meaningful curic- and having pursued a meaningful curriculum.  I think those are the key.  I mean, companies are real--it's gonna take you ten years for your college record to vanish from importance.  So, they gonna look at it, if they see a bunch of Cs and Ds, I think that's a problem.  Beyond that, I don't--I, I, I think it's just go into the system and make sure you take a meaningful curriculum.  And I would say also, very much that, that today's students need to have a graduate degree.  I mean, that's, that's gonna be very important.  And it probably--work for a couple of years before you go to graduate school.
Speaker 1: Okay. Anything else?
Speaker 2: I can't think of anything, we've been at it a while, haven't we.
Speaker 1: Well, I wanna say thank you from The HistoryMakers for taking the time to share your story.  It's been most inspirational.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
