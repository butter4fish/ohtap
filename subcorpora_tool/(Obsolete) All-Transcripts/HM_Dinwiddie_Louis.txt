Speaker 1: Before we get into depth, there are four "People Magazine-ish" type questions, or five, I always ask, you know, I'm compelled to ask these.  The first one is, what is your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Black.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Steak.

Speaker 2: Arizona.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: "A broke ass will break a rich ass every time."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Something that my father [James Arthur Dinwiddie] told me a long time ago.
Speaker 1: Can you explain that (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well, I think, the philosophy, the--the moral to that is that--that if you have people that are hanging on and people that are asking a lot of things from you and not contributing anything to you or for you, that it's going to bring you down to their level.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're well-to-do and your hangers-on are broke and pretty soon you'll be broke too? Is that right?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, if you take it to the extreme, I would imagine, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 67976
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's--let's talk about your background in the early days.  If you could give me the names of your parents and their birth dates and where they were born.
Speaker 2: My father, James Arthur Dinwiddie, he was a junior, he was born in Paris, Tennessee in 1910.  My mother, her maiden name was Mable, Mary Mable, she was born in Greenville, Texas in 1910.  Both of them are deceased.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm sorry, can you spell their names for us?
Speaker 2: My father's name?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: James, J-A-M-E-S, A, Dinwiddie, D-I-N-W-I-D-D-I-E and my mother's name is Mary, M-A-R-Y, E, Dinwiddie, D-I-N-W-I-D-D-I-E.
Speaker 1: Her maiden name is spelled?
Speaker 2: Mable, M-A-B-L-E.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, did they have a story about how they met?  Now, one's from Texas and one's from Tennessee, or--?
Speaker 2: Right, my father is--was a musician, living in St. Louis at the time and he had a band and they traveled all over the country.  And he came to Ft. Wayne [Indiana] and he was here for, I don't know, for a week or two, the story goes.  And he met my mother.  He was playing for a local business person here and he met my mother and they started courting and kind of one thing led to another and I think they just corresponded back and forth for a while and then he finally moved to Ft. Wayne, where she was living.  And they got married.
Story_ID: 67977
Speaker 1: Okay, now how did she wind up in Ft. Wayne?
Speaker 2: My mother's [Mary Mable Dinwiddie] side of the family were originally from Texas.  My grandfather, my mother's father, worked for the railroad, the old Nickel Plate Railroad here, and his job brought him to--brought him and his family to Ft. Wayne.  My wife and her two brothers and my grandmother.
Story_ID: 67978
Speaker 1: Okay, now did your parents have any stories or did your grandparents even have any stories about family history?  Did they have any stories about, you know, reconstruction or slavery or even further back?
Speaker 2: No, my mother [Mary Mable Dinwiddie] really didn't.  My father [James Arthur Dinwiddie] used to tell me interesting stories.  Him traveling around the country in the late '20's [1920s] and first time, I think he's told me, one story about--he's playing in North Dakota, his band was, it's an all-black band, and people would come up and rub their skin to see if it would really come off and, you know, it was the time that they had to--the bad times when they had to sleep in their--in their automobile.  They had one of these touring bus, automobile-type things, you know, and had to sleep in there and how they had to, at times, when they wouldn't get paid on--for doing their--doing what they do, they wouldn't get paid.  They'd get paid sometimes in food and sometimes not at all.  And there was times that they had to leave town abruptly and leave sometimes some instruments in some of the Southern states and then sometimes out in the far West and the Northern part of the country.
Story_ID: 67979
Speaker 1: Okay, did he have any other--any stories about his grandparents?  Did your grandparents have any stories about (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: No, you know, unfortunately, I--you know in retrospect you--you look back and say, gee, you know, I really should have questioned my grandmother and grandfather about--about their parents and their heritage but, unfortunately, I didn't ask--many, I think, many people may be around my age in this part of the country really didn't do.  One of the things about "Roots", I think, is it awakened everybody to the point where you're saying, wait a minute, you know, I've got a history, you know, my people have a history and for me, personally, I felt that--I never thought of that, you know, until "Roots", you know.  It really started me to thinking, so, wait a minute, you know, there's more to my family than my grandparents, you know.  What about their grandparents?  And, unfortunately, when I did question my grandmother about it, I got very little information, you know, at all, you know.  And I never asked my mother [Mary Mable Dinwiddie] and I never asked my father [James Arthur Dinwiddie].  And by me being the only child in--on--in my family, there's no siblings older than I that I could go to and say, "Hey, did you say anything to them", you know.  And I'm the oldest Dinwiddie on my father's side of the family.  I have something like nine cousins that are Dinwiddie's in St. Louis and I'm the oldest one.  And I've talked to them and, you know, they don't--they don't know anything either.
Story_ID: 67980
Speaker 1: Did your father [James Arthur Dinwiddie]--what instrument did he play and how did he get started as a musician?
Speaker 2: You know I really don't--he played trumpet and saxophone and he taught here in Ft. Wayne [Indiana] for--for a number of years and, like again, he traveled all over the country.  How he got started, you know, I don't know.  He started playing trumpet first.  And that's, you know, and looking back there's a lot of things I wish I had asked my parents, you know, truly about their younger days.  I know about when my father left Tennessee, they moved to Danville, Illinois and my grandfather had a coal wagon.  He used to help my grandfather on his coal wagon with the horse and the whole--the whole nine yards.  I don't know how he picked up, or why he picked up a trumpet.  There's--there's no one else in my family that's musically inclined.  Later on, his brother, my uncle, Lawrence Dinwiddie, picked up a electric guitar and he played in my father's band for quite some time.  But, I really don't know how that came about.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the band he played in, again?
Speaker 2: It was a, "Jimmy Dinwiddie North Carolina" something.  You know, I don't know.  He had--he had two bands.  Well, one was an orchestra.  It was--I've got pictures of that.  It's about a twelve piece orchestra and it was, "Jimmy Dinwiddie and the North Carolina" something.  I forget.  I--
Speaker 1: Why did he call it "The North Carolina"?
Speaker 2: You know, there again, there's another mystery for you, you know.  And this--what's interesting is the picture that I have of him and his band.  It was taken on this large stage, I mean like, you know, big theatre, you know, with a heavy velvet curtains and, you know, and the stands that the large bands would have in front to hold their music and things and such.  You know, it was how he come to that name, I do not know.  Then he has, I have another photo of him.  This had to be taken in the maybe 1920, 19, no, maybe 1930, somewhere in late '20's [1920s].  But this was a four-piece outfit and, you know,  they got a person playing a banjo and a lady on the piano and a trombone and, you know, it looks like the old picture you see with Louis Armstrong and Bix Beiderbecke, the old and the new artist type thing, but there's no caption to that, at all, you know.
Story_ID: 67981
Speaker 1: Okay, what about your mother [Mary Mabel Dinwiddie] now, what did she do now?
Speaker 2: My mother basically was a housewife.  My father [James Arthur Dinwiddie] left and--left Ft. Wayne [Indiana] in 1948 and--and he and my mother separated.  He moved to New York.  And my mother was a housekeeper for a prominent white family, here for--up until maybe three or four years before she died, thirty, forty years, she retired from that.  Other than that she--she was, you know, just basically, mom, you know.  And she always was able to take of us.  So she took care of me more than I could take care of her, it seems, even after I became an adult, you know, mom was always there.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.  So your father left you when you were about 12 years old?
Speaker 2: Twelve years old, right, and we--we didn't communicate for a number of years.  Of course I was upset, being young and at that age, you know, understand those kinds of things.  And I think that it was maybe seven or eight years went by before we started communicate again.  Then, later on, I spent four years in the Military and during that time, I think that we became close again.  I got married, had kids.  He came down.  He used to come down and visit us, you know, after that.  He came down to my kids' graduation and--but it was about six or seven years during that time that we didn't communicate at all.
Story_ID: 67982
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so tell me about the growing up here in Ft. Wayne [Indiana].  What are some of the sights and sounds and smells of the neighborhood and the environs that you inhabited when you were a child, here?
Speaker 2: Well, I was truly blessed in growing up in Ft. Wayne.  I grew up in an area which is no longer here.  It's Westfield area.  It was kind of country, you know, compared to Ft. Wayne.  We had no--no reason to come on to downtown Ft. Wayne other than maybe once a--once a week to go to the local movie theatre.  We had a kind of a black community within ours--our own little community in the Westfield area.  And, you know, we grew up with the cornfields.  We knew where all the cherry trees was.  And we knew where the apple trees and the grapevines and the peach trees, which we used to raid on quite frequently during the season.  It was a kind of community that no doors was locked.  Neighbors looked after neighbors children.  If a neighbor person, especially somebody's mother, would see one of us doing something wrong, you can believe we's going to catch it from her as well as when we got home.  We--we--as young people, we did things like kind of corny things.  We built little soap box derby out of orange crates, cars, you know, with some old roller skates and put them on the bottom and do that.  We used to ice skate on a junk ditch.  That's where I learned how to ice skate.  And we'd go swimming.  We had to--we had to pass a white swimming pool to get to a white public swimming pool.  Had to pass that to get to a public swimming pool that we could only swim until 12 o'clock and sometimes we'd walk and we're talking, maybe seven, eight, nine miles, and some of us had bicycles and we had--do our bikes every day.  Played a lot of sports in summertime.  Played a little bit of everything and we just had a community of our own.  And it was great. I--
Story_ID: 67983
Speaker 1: I, I was baptized in a Baptist Church and for some reason, before my father [James Arthur Dinwiddie] left, he was confirmed as a Catholic and got me confirmed.  So I spent my grade school, junior high school, and high school years in Catholic high schools, which I did not like at the time because all my friends were going to public school.  But I got a far better education than my friends did.  I could tell because we're the same age that I found that, you know, we were far advanced as far as our school academics and my counterparts was in the same grade as I was going to public schools.  Growing up in that era, we didn't run into too much segregation.  This, I'm talking, in the '40's [1940s].  Again, I went to Catholic school and I was the only black in the school and never--never, not one time that I can remember a bad incident in going into some of my white friends' homes.  You know, where the father, the mother, would say something or do something or make me feel not welcome.  It was a great learning experience for me, living in a black community, going to a white school.  It was a great learning experience for me and I think it's helped me further on in life, you know, as I've moved on in life.
Story_ID: 67984
Speaker 1: Okay, what kind of student were you in school, you know, in grade--
Speaker 2: At the, you know, at the beginning--at the beginning of the semester, when we go back to school in Spring, I mean in Summer, in the Fall, we go back to school, the first quarter I was probably a "B" and as for some reason as the year progressed, my grades would digress, you know, in the sense.  I'd go out--I never failed but I did be a "C".  I did apply myself as much as I should have, you know.  I was athletically inclined.  I got a scholarship to go to high school [Central Catholic High School].  Of course, there's tuition in Catholic schools, you know, you had to pay--
Speaker 1: What did you play?
Speaker 2: Well, I played all three sports, track, football and basketball.  Probably my--I'd like to think my best sport was basketball but I was on a state championship football team, here at Ft. Wayne in 1950.
Speaker 1: What position did you play?
Speaker 2: I was a quarterback.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And which was--which was unique in itself.
Speaker 1: There's a lot of notoriety there--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it did.
Speaker 1: --a black quarterback (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I'm the only black in the school, I have to play quarterback and--but that happened when in grade school.  I, you know, those were the days where you just about fold your helmet up and put it in your back pocket, you know.  Yeah, I played a lot of positions because the grade school I went to was fairly small.  And I played quarterback because I was the only one that could throw the ball ten yards, you know.  That's how it started out.  But I was coached relatively well and, believe it or not, I was recruited to go to Central Catholic, the school I went to.  I wanted to go to Central where all the blacks were going.  But, you know, at that time, I think we had--we only had three public high schools--four public high schools in Ft. Wayne.  And the whole overwhelming majority of the blacks went to Central High School.  A few went to South Side [High School] and very, very few went to North Side [High School].  And--and a kid from my area was going to Central, and that's where I wanted to go, where all my buddies were, you know.  But I ended up at Central Catholic and, again, you know, I was--after I got into it, I was very happy that I went.
Story_ID: 67985
Speaker 1: I felt that I missed a lot of camaraderie as far as high school is concerned with my friends because the whole time I was at Central Catholic [High School, Fort Wayne, Indiana], I don't think I ate in the cafeteria but once.  Not that I couldn't, I just didn't feel comfortable, you know.
Speaker 2: Hold it (pause).  Nature speaks.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 1: Not that I--not that I couldn't eat in the cafeteria or have any, you know, my run of the whole school by being an athlete, you know, the state championship football team and being a pretty good jock, you know, I was fairly popular but I felt more comfortable in walking a block or two and eating with my friends, you know, eating lunch with my friends.
Speaker 2: Okay, so, Central Catholic was located in the central part of the city?
Speaker 1: Yes, it's right across the street from Central High School [Fort Wayne, Indiana].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Right across the street, right.  And we'd, you know, my friends and I would get on the bus and we'd drive to school together.  Of course, we had to ride the city bus. There was no school busing.  And we'd get off and when we'd get through in the evenings, we'd probably ride home together, you know.  But the only time that we were apart, most of my friends, is during the school hours.
Speaker 2: What did--did your friends--how did they treat you, you know, did they treat you any differently?  Was there any price to pay for going to Central Catholic?
Speaker 1: Well, at first--at first, you know, they were on me a little bit, you know, about going to a parochial school.  But that was okay.  Where I found that where they really tried to get to me was on the football field and fortunately we had a better team than Central had.  So the guys that were out to get me it never happened, you know, but all in, what, all in friendship, you know.  We're living next door to each other, you know, and I grew up in the projects, in the original projects in Ft. Wayne.  And the guy that lived across the driveway, you know, and we all grew up together.  I'm talking from six, seven years on up.  And these are the guys that were really out to get me, you know.  They said, okay, we're going to make you pay, buddy, you know.  But fortunately it never happened.
Story_ID: 67986
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so when you're in high school [Central Catholic High School, Fort Wayne, Indiana], did--were there any particular teachers or coaches that were mentors to you that really took an interest in you that you thought was, in retrospect now, was piloting you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, two of the most unlikely people, I think, that, you know, just thinking about it, again, I was recruited to go to Central Catholic.  I was going to go to Central.  I got a scholarship and I gave the scholarship back.  It was in the summer months.  And the basketball coach, the varsity basketball coach, the track coach and my junior high school basketball coach came to my house.  And my junior high school basketball coach was a mentor to me, you know, all the way through all the time I was at--in junior high school.  And they're trying to--they're convincing me, or trying to convince me, to go to Central Catholic, get a better education.  They appealed to my mother [Mary Mable Dinwiddie] and my mother said, "Well, I'm going to leave it up to him."  And I had truly made up my mind that I was going to go to Central High School in Ft. Wayne [Indiana].  And what turned me around, and I'll never forget as long as I live, my junior high school basketball coach, well he was the basketball, football coach and track coach, tears started coming out of his eyes, you know, it wasn't a boohoo cry.  But I mean this guy was so sincere that--that he was crying, you know.  And I'm thinking, you know, I'm--I'll never forget this.  I was laying in the floor, this had to be on a Sunday evening, 'cause I was listening to the "Green Hornet" on radio, this was before television, and I'm looking up at this guy, and his name was Harry Boxberger, he just passed not too long ago, and tears were coming out of his eyes, you know, and I'm thinking, you know, God, you know, nobody's--you know this guy's gotta be sincere, you know, nobody's ever done this, you know.  And so I said, okay, you know, I'll go--I'll go, I'll take the scholarship.
Story_ID: 67987
Speaker 1: And further in school, I think it was in my sophomore, junior year, the track coach, he was assistant football coach, and he kinda took a liking to me.  And I remember one of the things, he was a hardnosed guy, I mean, this guy was hardnosed, I mean.  The more--the more blood you'd see at football practice, you know, the better he had liked it, you know.  You had to give up 110 percent out there.  And I was playing, we were scrimmaging, and I was playing defense.  I was defensive back and this guy came up and blindsided me.  He was--he made All-State, this guy did by the way.  His name was Don Rushin, he blindsided me.  He hit me in the mouth with his forearm.  This was before the--before the face guards and stuff and he just not messed, you know, the green stars and the whole bit.  He didn't knock me out but he rang my bell.  So, you know, I got up, shook it off and he came over to talk to you, okay, fine, I'm okay, so he says you know what to do, don't you, you know?  We're in scrimmage, you know.  This is man eat man and so he says go get him, you know.  So he sent me after him.  And I was only, I think I was a sophomore and this guy was a senior, All-State, you know.  And--which I did and it gave me the confidence that I needed, I think, to--to make the team and stay on the team as far as moving from that kind of shy adolescent to being a young man, you know, ready to take your knocks and give 'em too.  Of course, you know, we're all great friends.  But his name was, what was his name?  Anderson.  I can't think of his name, the assistant coach, but he would always give me that extra little boost I needed all the way through school.  When things got a little tough for me, I'd go down to the coach's office and I could always count on him to--to have time for me.
Story_ID: 67988
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, when you were in high school [Central Catholic High School, Fort Wayne, Indiana] then, what did you--what did you think you would do after high school?  When did you think in terms of career?
Speaker 2: You know, I--that's one of the things that myself, as well as, most of my friends, I don't recall any of my friends and I talking about what we wanted to do when we got out of school, what we wanted to be, you know, realizing this is in the late '40's [1940s] and early '50's [1950s].  And Ft. Wayne [Indiana] had--Ft. Wayne didn't have a black educator in the whole city, not one, in the late '40's [1940s].  The only businesses that were that we could attribute to black folk were a couple of restaurants, a couple of bars.
Speaker 1: There was a chicken place or something there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was a chicken shack out on my end of town, out in Westfield.  Basically that's it.  There was nothing there.  The street people, the pimps and the hustlers were the guys with the big cars, you know, and the shiny suits and the money, you know, and the good looking women and stuff, you know.  And the--I've known educators that had been to black colleges that were working in factories.  I know a contractor that went to school to be a contractor and the best thing he could get a job was laying cement, you know, for a white company, you know.  There was no--there was no one really for us to enjoy say, "Oh, gee, I'd like to be like that person", you know.  There just was--and then again in high school there was no blacks studies programs, you know, especially in Catholic school but not even in the public schools.  There was no counselors that would tell you and say, "Hey, you know, you need to think about going here, doing this."  There was no guidance at all whatsoever, not in the Catholic school and really not in--at Central at Ft. Wayne community schools.  There was a college prep course you could take at Central.  There was a general course and, you know, there was many, many kids that wanted to take college prep.  They discouraged them from doing that, you know.  But, there was nobody I--my dad [James Arthur Dinwiddie] tried to make a musician out of me.  You know, again, he was a teacher and I would be--I'd be at home and riding the scales on a saxophone, the guys would be out front playing football and basketball, in the summertime.  So finally he told me that, he says, your heart's really not in it.  I says, no dad, it's really not. He says, okay.  He says I'm not gonna make you do it.  He says, but, some day you gonna wish that you had stuck with it.  And he's absolutely right.  Many, many year, you know, I've thought, you know, that, you know, if I could have--I should have stayed with it, you know.  But--that was it.  I didn't--I really didn't--I really didn't have anything that--I didn't know what I wanted to do.  What I wanted to be.
Story_ID: 67989
Speaker 1: Did you enjoy being a star in high school [Central Catholic High School, Fort Wayne, Indiana]?  I mean a sports star?
Speaker 2: It kind of came natural.  You know, when you're saying, enjoy, it's fun being--it was fun being good enough to make the team, you know, to make a high school team.  It was, I think it was kind of great in the sense that I'm playing on an all-white basketball team, an all-white football team, you know, and the football team just happened to win the State Championship.
Speaker 1: Okay, we're going to change tape right here.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: We're going to stop.  Every half hour it runs out, so we'll stop right here.
Speaker 2: God. You got me talkin', man.
Speaker 1: That's good, that's good.
Story_ID: 67990
Speaker 1: Okay, we got to start again--
Speaker 2: Okay--
Speaker 1: --and we left off in high school [Central Catholic High School, Fort Wayne, Indiana] and you're thinking about like what you're gonna do when you get out, you know.  You were talking about--you had some notoriety in sports but you still hadn't thought about what to do next.
Speaker 2: I still hadn't thought about what I wanted to do and a little bit before I graduated, I had a couple of--three friends and, of course, they were at Central [High School, Fort Wayne, Indiana] and they had decided to join the Air Force.  And so they came and talked to me and I said, no, I don't know.  So they kept, you know, they kept kind of on me and so I went down to the Post Office with them and talked to the recruiter and they talked me into joining the Air Force.  So, I kind of talked myself into it too because I kind of wanted to get away and, you know, at that young age you think you're a man and I knew that I really wasn't a man quite yet because, you know, again it's one of those things where my mom [Mary Mable Dinwiddie] would fix my eggs just the way I liked them and if they weren't that way, I, you know, she knew I wouldn't eat 'em.  And I knew I couldn't go through life that way, you know.  And little things, you know, like keeping your room clean, keeping your bed made, you know, mom is always there.
Story_ID: 67991
Speaker 1: And the--
Speaker 2: Just a second.  How many brothers do you have?
Speaker 1: Just me.
Speaker 2: Just you?  You're an only child. Oh--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm the only child--
Speaker 2: --yeah, you're really a great big brat?
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, if you can be spoiled in the projects, you know, but I knew that I had a long way to go to be a man.  I really did.  I realized that.  And the lure of South Sea Islands and, you know, cool breezes, and this type of thing.  They paint a pretty good picture at the recruiting office, you know.  And so they got me hooked in there.  But after I got in the Service, I found out very quickly, you know.  One of the things that the Air Force, well, all branches of the Service, and I think they do a tremendous job in turning young people, teenagers, into men in less than three, four months.  I mean, when you come out of basic training, you're a man, you are.  You know how to take care of yourself.  You know how to defend yourself.  You know how to do all the things that you're supposed to do as a man in a very early age.  And they cram this down your throat, man, in a very short period of time.  And this is what they did and I'm grateful for that.  I enjoyed the Air Force.  I was an Air Police for four years.  And I enjoyed it immensely.
Speaker 2: Where were you stationed?
Speaker 1: I was stationed in--I took my basic in San Antonio, Texas.  Left there and went to Phoenix, Luke Air Force Base in Phoenix, Arizona, where I met my wife.  Left there and went to Sandia Base [Kirtland Air Force Base] in Albuquerque, New Mexico and left there and went to Panama, Albrook Air Force Base in the Canal Zone, and left there and went to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona and where I was discharged.
Speaker 2: For how long were you in there for?
Speaker 1: Four years.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I spent four years in the Air Force.  I thought very seriously about making a career out of that.  As a matter of fact, I was going to take my re-up money and buy me a 1956 Crown Victoria and with the chrome going across the top and the mufflers (vroom), you know.  A buddy of mine did that and I says, that's what I'm gonna do.  And my wife and I talked about it and when I came back from overseas, and at the last moment, I changed my mind and it was over very--something very trivial.  The--my First Sergeant didn't like me for some reason, you know, and I don't know, you know. I'd been in the Service long enough that I knew my "P"s and "Q"s.  I worked main gate and town patrol, you know, and you can't do that if you're, you know, if you're a slouch.  And he made me clear the base when I was getting discharged, you know, it's a rule.  When you get discharged, they give you two or three days to clear the base, you know.  The supply and finance, you know.  You see the chaplain, you see the doctor.  They give you two or three days off just before you get discharged.  They made me do that on my off-duty time.  I worked till the day--I worked main gate the day before I was discharged.  And I--it really turned me off, you know, a trivial thing and I don't know if I did the best in life by not staying in for twenty years, thirty years.  But I decided to get out and then come back home.
Story_ID: 67992
Speaker 1: So, and I did, you know.  I got discharged and spent a little time in Phoenix [Arizona] and I told my wife that I was going to take her to the big city, Ft. Wayne, Indiana, you know, which she had never been here before.  And my wife had never seen any snow before.  She was born and raised in Phoenix.  And so I brought her to this large city and so we've been here ever since.  We've been married for 47, 48 years, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay, so what did you do when you--when you got here in Ft. Wayne?  What career did you pursue?  Did you seek security work?  Or, that kind of--
Speaker 1: I--I was asked by--when I came home in 1956, there were two, three--there were three black police officers and I think one detective on the Police Department here.  There was one black person on the Sheriff's Department.  One of the gentlemen is on the Police Department was a--lived in Westfield in my part of town.  His son turned me onto jazz, you know, when I first started listening to jazz.  I've been knowing him all my life.  He tried to get me to be in the Police Department.  I was young and I wasn't really ready for--and my first job, I worked at the steel mill here.  A very dirty job.  A very hard--I stayed there six and a half years and hated every moment of it.  I knew that wasn't for me.  The job that I ended up with was not a hard job, it was a very, very easy job.  I moved up to--to better paying jobs and better positions in the plant.  But I knew that factory work wasn't for me, you know, and I really didn't know at that--still at that point in my life, I really didn't know what I wanted to be or do.
Story_ID: 67993
Speaker 1: My second job was insurance, insurance salesman, Chicago Metropolitan Life.  I think the headquarters is in Chicago or Gary or Chicago.  And a friend of mine was a debit manager here at Ft. Wayne.  That's one of those insurances, it paid me 35 cents a week for the rest of your life and you get $500, maybe, you know, when you die, you or your family.  And I ran that debit for a year or two and I found out that I really didn't like selling insurance.  That wasn't my--my cup of tea either.  But I knew that I liked to sell.  That was the first key that I got that I liked selling.  And we'd have meetings once a month in Gary [Indiana], district meetings.  And in Gary they had street Broadway, was a main street in Gary where they had stores and things and they had the high fashion.  I bought Billy Epstein collared shirts and the stegy (ph.) brim hats and this type of thing.  We had nothing like that here in Ft. Wayne [Indiana].  And going to the sales meetings, I would, you know, I'd pick up a few things when I'd go and a few of my friends said, gee, Louie, I like that, you know.  The next time you go, bring me something back.  So it got to the point where the back of my car was just jammed packed with boxes of shirts and sweaters, things that just were in Gary and Chicago [Illinois], at the time, the high fashion stuff, sharkskin slacks and, you know.  And so I said, well wait a minute, you know, maybe--maybe this could be a thing for you.  So I opened up a little shop--a little store front shop and which was just the feel naturally with no experience and not really knowing anything about the retail business.  That lasted for five, six months, you know.
Story_ID: 67994
Speaker 1: Then I applied for a job at one of the leading department stores here in Ft. Wayne [Indiana] and they told me they didn't have anything in sales.  They weren't hiring blacks in sales but they had something on the dock for me.  And I said, no, it's not what I want.  And then they had another job in the classifieds, is the other thing, was a credit clothing store, you know.  All you need is a social security card, you got instant credit, you know.  And that's where I really cut my teeth, I think, in the retail business.  This guy--there was no blacks in sales in Ft. Wayne, in retail sales.  There might have been one.  There was one.  Other than that, nobody was in retail sales.  And so I went downtown.  I had my suit on and my tie and to apply for the job and so he says, okay, he says, we'll give you a shot at it.  He says can you go to work today?  Sure.  He says, okay.  He went and got me a bucket and a squeegee.  Now, this is right on the main street.  This is where the buses stop.  I mean, you know, going--transferring to different parts of the community.  So he brings a bucket out and then he says, okay, first thing I want you to do is wash the windows.  I said, nah, I don't think that we're on the same page, here.  He says, no, he says, what I want you to do is I'm starting you from ground level.  He says eventually you might have an opportunity to manage the store.  You need to know how long it takes to wash a window.  You need to know the right way to wash windows.  It made sense.  And I did.  I rolled my sleeves up, took my coat off.  Naturally I--a city bus stopped by and naturally here's five of my friends sitting right there at the window, you know, just as it would happen.  But I stuck with it and the guy was sincere.  You know the interesting point in that same gig, I had these big--big windows, you know, and I can--in the downtown days when they had the mannequins in the windows and stuff and we had these women mannequins up there and I had to undress a woman mannequin right there in the show window right on the street.  And that was very--that was very, what, embarrassing, you know, when you're--I'm doing this with the lady's dress over her head and, you know, I'm taking this off and dressing her.  But he said--I says, well, I don't know how to do this.  So he says, well, just remember color and scheme balances.  And through trial and error, he taught me how to dress windows.  We did alterations at the store.  He showed me how to do the alterations on men's pants and I sold ladies braziers.  I got so good a lady could walk in and "38B", you know, come this way (laughter).
Story_ID: 67995
Speaker 1: Did that unnerve the ladies a little bit?
Speaker 2: That did--that did.  It was always a good conversation piece when you meet new people, too, you know.  But he taught me a lot about--a tremendous amount about the retail business and they offered me a job in Biloxi, Mississippi, managing a store.  And the company policy was, if you--if you're offered a--to be a manager of a store, you got to take it or you got to resign.  So I told them, I says, you know, this was in '60' [1960]--oh, gee, this is in maybe '67' [1967], somewhere in there.  I said, this was before Martin Luther King [Jr.], okay.
Speaker 1: You mean '57' [1957] or--
Speaker 2: No this had to be--this had to be--no this was in the '60's [1960s].  This was '63' [1963], maybe.
Speaker 1: --'cause King was starting to become a national (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Sixty-two--
Speaker 1: Fifty-seven--
Speaker 2: Fifty-seven, wow, okay, anyway, I told him, I says, well, Martin Luther King hadn't been to Ft. Wayne yet, but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but I said, you know, black folk are leaving Mississippi coming North.  At this day and time there's no black folk leaving North going to Mississippi, you know.  I just couldn't see myself going to Biloxi.  So, he kept me.  And the district guy came and they liked--they liked me.  And they really wanted me to do--take the job but I says, no, no.
Story_ID: 67996
Speaker 1: From there I went to one of the most prestigious stores in Ft. Wayne, Patterson Fletcher [Clothing Store] and it was a full department store, you know, like Macy's or Gimbels, or Marshall Field's, you know, it's got everything, you know, about five different floors.  And I applied for a job their and got a job in Misses Department.  And stayed with them for five or six years.  Managed at one of the--one of the stores in the shopping malls for them.  Left there and opened my own store.  I was doing most of the buying for my department.  My boss was making five times the amount of money I was and he was relying on my expertise and my ability to pick out what people were wearing, what they wanted, and all I was getting was a title, you know, and I wasn't gettin' paid.  So, I decided to--to open up my own store. And, fortunately, during this time, the president of Patterson Fletcher belongs to the Men Retailer's Association of America, which the government had a program to bring minorities into retail clothing, at that time.  And I got in that program and they had a buyer for me when I got to New York that day.  He took me under his wing and took me around to the different--different factories, the different outlets--the wholesale outlets.  And took me to the different shows, and stuff, and showed me how to buy and what to buy, you know, and this type of thing.  And so I opened up my first clothing store, "Louie D's" in 1970 and I had it for ten years and it was fairly successful.
Story_ID: 67997
Speaker 1: Interesting--interesting enough, my store was the first store that brought pleated pants to Ft. Wayne, you know.  None of the other stores had pleated pants.  Well, we brought the bell bottoms in, when the bell bottoms--Harry Belafonte [HM] shirts and this type thing.  It was a high-fashion type thing but we did--my business was unique.  I set it up on the edge of the community.  I didn't want to get in the black community.  I didn't want white people to feel threatened or challenged coming into the black community to a store.  I didn't want to set it too far out to make it inconvenient for black folks to get there so I set it right on the edge of the--of both communities.  And did very well with that.  Ninety percent of my business, Monday through Thursday, were my white clientele and Friday and Saturday, you know, the brothers were there.  And so I did business just about every day and it was very successful.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah, that's in 1970.  What was the--I guess the bell bottoms were out then?
Speaker 1: Bell bottoms, yeah.  Bell bottoms, the Harry Belafonte shirts, the balloon shirts, you know, with the open collar.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Platform shoes, polyester jumpsuits, big 'fros, you know, during that time, and we had it all.  We had it all.  You know, leather--yeah, we did it all.  And I still--this is 1970, mind you.  What's this, thirty, forty years.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I still have people tell me they have some merchandise that I sold them, you know (laughter).
Speaker 2: Still have it?
Speaker 1: Yes, so what are you--don't wear it (laughter).  Just hold onto it.  It might be worth something some time.  I don't think it's coming back, man.  But, yeah, I still have people that tell me, says--and I've met people that--you know, I remember you, you know, my mom used to buy clothes for me when I's going to IU [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana], you know.  She'd come out, tell her I want my clothes from Louie D's, you know.  A lot of times when I say, Louie Dinwiddie, "Louie D"?  Yeah, I don't know the people, you know.  But I had a lot--we had a lot of goodwill in the community, too, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 67998
Speaker 1: Were there many other black entrepreneurs in the city?
Speaker 2: Then?
Speaker 1: At that time, yeah?
Speaker 2: No, no.  Let me think.  Someone had a record shop, for a minute, but I don't think that lasted.  That didn't last long.  No, the drycleaners, you know, that type of thing, you know.  Then--no entrepreneurs but, you know, then professionals were coming in then, you know, dentists, doctors.  People just needed more professional--people were coming in.  But as far as business people, I was probably one of the first to step out of the barbershop, beauty shop, restaurant syndrome.
Speaker 1: Funeral parlor, right.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  Funeral parlor, right.
Story_ID: 67999
Speaker 1: So, what--when your business closed, I mean what did you do next?  What did you have on the--
Speaker 2: Well I was--
Speaker 1: --money?
Speaker 2: --I was the--my business started, kind of, slowing down and I had a deal with the--I had a loan with the bank and had great credit, you know, and never missed a payment or anything.  And as a matter-of-fact, they would take the loan payment out of my account--my checking account.  One of the vice presidents I had ran into at a--somewhere, I forget where we were at, but he told me they had a new president at the bank.  He says, Louie, you might as well get you another bank to do business with 'cause they're not gonna give you any more loans.  Well, what I would have to do twice a year, I'd get maybe 50, 60 thousand dollars on a ninety day note so I could go to New York, buy the merchandise.  I got it on a ninety day--got it on a ninety day note and in the ninety days, you know, I paid for it.  I did this for years.  New president comes in, no.  So, when it came time for me to buy merchandise for the Fall, I couldn't get my ninety day note.  Well, you know, it goes without saying, I filed a complaint with the control of the currency against the bank.  Of course it didn't do any good in a sense that my business--I couldn't get new merchandise in like I needed.  So I started looking at other avenues and this is where the--when cable industry was just hitting our community.
Story_ID: 68000
Speaker 1: And--and I always was interested in radio not knowing anything. I've never been in a radio station in my whole life.  I didn't know a "VU" meter from a turntable.  I started looking at the possibility of a radio station in Ft. Wayne [Indiana] and come to find out it was, you know, you're talking millions of dollars, you know, at least hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars.  And I ran across this article in a magazine, where in the classified where it says, you know, send me ten bucks and I'll make you a millionaire.  Well, the only guy's who's going to be a millionaire is the guy you sent in the ten bucks to, right?  But they had this article in there that said, "You want to own your own radio station without going through the FCC [Federal Communications Commission]?"  And it sounded interesting but it didn't sound true.  But the hook in it was that I didn't have to send him any money, so, just a postcard.  And so, which I did.  And it was some little town in California.  Modesto comes to mind but I don't know if it's Modesto or not but some small town in California, that's--
Speaker 2: Well, that's the town where you can send away to get a preacher's license.
Speaker 1: It might be the same person.
Speaker 2: Universal Life Church (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay, it might be the same guy, I don't know, but--
Speaker 2: Kirby Hensley (simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 1: I had no idea but I still got the books.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: And I sent off and I kind of forgot it.  And about a week or two later, I get a couple of books.  And it was things in general about AM radio, FM radio and carry a current radio and cable radio.  So I went through them and so he said, well, I have more information.  He says now I need, I think it was $34 and I'm saying, well, you know, I'm out this far, thirty four bucks.  So I sent him the thirty four and he sent me some more information.  I found that everything that was the printed word on cable radio, that was the best way to go, and being that we were just wiring up Ft. Wayne for a cable television.  And I went to the library and the library had nothing, totally nothing, on cable radio.  I--I called this guy up in California and he had--all he had was what he sent me.  And, as a matter of fact, I did call the Chamber of Commerce in that small town and the guy was in good standing in the Better Business Bureau.  He was in good standing.  So I just didn't have anywhere to go but other than the very limited information he had sent me and so I says, I'll go with that.
Story_ID: 68001
Speaker 1: And I went out to the cable company and talked to the president of the cable company, and probably one of my better selling pitches, I convinced him that I was an expert, in which I knew totally nothing about cable radio.  Now, I think the fortunate thing was he knew less than I did and so he says, okay, we'll go with it.  And we kind of started from there and it was trial and error in the sense that I got this one guy to set me up some turntables and a board and a thing to run a commercial through.  And this guy, just really ripped me off.  He gave me two Sony turntables from Radio Shack and he gave me a cart machine, which you put two carts in for the commercial.  Believe it or not, I should have kept it.  But they had tubes, I mean, regular vacuum tubes.  They don't even make these any more, you know.  And so I went through this and a friend of a friend knew this guy was an engineer, a radio engineer, and he came by and we were on the air.  We were on--we were on cable.  And we'd have to stop program and do a commercial, you know, we had to take a--we're gonna take a twenty-five minute break so we can do this.  But he came by 'cause he was a certified engineer and he says, Louie, he says, I can do better than this for you.  And so he kind of started--he stayed with me all the way through, all into my FM days, until I went off the air, till I sold the radio station.  But I stayed with the cable for quite some time and it was--it was a good learning experience about people and about the community because in talking to businesses, supermarkets, you know, we had clients like--we had Marshall Field's as clients.  We had Kroger's, we had A&P, we had McDonald's, we had Pepsi Cola, we had Coca Cola, and this is cable and that's when it first hit the community, not knowing, you know, these people know nothing about cable, you know.  We had to tell 'em what channel we were on, you know, the whole nine yards.  But it worked for them, you know, advertisement does work.
Story_ID: 68002
Speaker 1: All of the community was 100 percent behind us.  We ran out of money.  Couldn't pay the rent. Couldn't pay the light bill.  So the guy I had working with me says, let's do a Radiothon.  I said, Radiothon, I says, yeah, no.  He says what have we got to lose.  We did a Radiothon and generated $8,000 from the community, you know.  It was unbelievable, you know.  They gave us $8,000 to keep the radio station on the air.  That lasted us--that $8,000 lasted us, with the meager salaries I was paying the guys, and the rent, electricity, I had to pay $100--$125 a month to the cable company for the hook up.  That lasted us over a year.  But at the end of that year, we had to run another Radiothon.  I think this time we got about six thousand.  And from that six thousand, we went on, you know, that was just--we just--we just--everything went up, you know.  The clients started coming in.  The community was always there for us but letting the clients know, our potential clients know, that the community, the black community was behind us.
Story_ID: 68003
Speaker 1: And so we had to call--we had to call for a--had to call for a boycott at one time at one of the stores.  Well, one of the ministers did, Reverend Jesse White.  And--because we were spending all our money with this particular store--supermarket, and not only would they not spend any money in advertising with us, they didn't even have any checkout people of color, you know.  They didn't have any carryout kids as color, you know, and one of the largest supermarkets in the city.  So, we got all that squared away, you know, through the radio station and through the ministers.  And, I think, it kind of just turned the light off for a lot of the retail--not a lot of--yeah, a lot of the retail businesses in the community that black folks were spending money with and were not putting anything back into the community, you know, as far as advertising is concerned.
Story_ID: 68004
Speaker 1: So, that was our cable years and, again, you know, people, they did--some articles were done on it and we got to be nationally known.  I had people as far as New York City [New York] come to Ft. Wayne [Indiana] to find out--sit down with me, which I didn't charge anything.  How do you do this, you know?  How do you do this?  And New York, Kansas City [Kansas].  There's one I know still in existence in Minneapolis-St. Paul [Minnesota] area, that I put on the air.  This has been over twenty years and he's still on the air, on the cable end of it.
Speaker 2: Now, what was your--what was your programming like--I mean what kind of programming--
Speaker 1: It was basically--it was an urban programming.  I--you know, I spent my--I spent my summers in--with--and in Chicago [Illinois] and my grandmother in St. Louis, you know.  One summer here, one summer there.  And St. Louis [Missouri] especially and Chicago also, but St. Louis especially.  I remember getting up every Sunday morning listening to gospel on the radio and you don't have an urban radio station as far as I'm concerned, if you don't have gospel on Sunday mornings, right?  You don't have an urban station if you don't have some type of--some type of blues programming on a Saturday, you know.  And I set it up basically in that mode.  I missed the boat on hip hop in the sense that when rap came through, I didn't play any rap.  Up until I sold the radio station, I played very, very little rap.  I kept it in the age group of thirty-plus, I would imagine, you know.  We did a lot of heavy soul in our clock.  We would do--we'd do a jazz cut once an hour, you know.  We'd do black news.  And everything was geared toward the community.  We did a lot of public service announcements, a lot of PSA's [public service announcements] for the community.  My thought was, it's a community station, you know, and how else are you gonna get the news.  How else you know what's gonna happen unless we give it to you, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 68005
Speaker 1: So unfortunately you can't get it driving through here 'cause it's on television, right, you got that?
Speaker 2: No, no, that was the cable radio station was--it was--the call letters was C-O-O-L, Cool Cable Radio.  I had this logo of Marvin Gaye, was a caricature of Marvin Gaye was our logo.  That was on the cable end and--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: --yeah, not unless you had a really long extension cord (laughter), you couldn't get the cable station but then we moved from the cable to the FM radio--
Speaker 1: Okay, so you actually were on FM, okay.  Foxy Radio was on.
Speaker 2: Foxy was FM--was FM radio station and the government came through in 1990, yeah, around 1990, with a 80-90 docket and this basically was to get minorities involved in broadcasting in FM radio stations.  And so they did a lottery all across the country on this 80-90 docket.  And, you know, it was open to everybody but if you were a minority, and if you were a woman, if you spent some time in the Service, you got a couple of extra points after.  And so I decided to take a shot at it, you know.  I had the cable radio station at the time and I thought that would stand a good chance of getting in, which we did.  We ended up getting it.  And there was a lot of, again, you know, stepping into things that with no experience and no expertise, you know.  God looks after fools and babies, you know, at times, and surely he had his arms around me on a number of occasions in putting this FM station together.
Story_ID: 68006
Speaker 1: But one of the things, I think the intentions were right.  My intentions were right in doing this.  We had trouble with the FAA [Federal Aviation Administration].  The FCC [Federal Communications Commission] was cool in putting a tower up.  We had to get the okay from the FCC.  They tell you where to put your tower and the area where you can put it is on a, maybe a twenty, twenty-five square mile area where you can put your broadcasting tower.  And so we found a place and the FCC approved it but the FAA would not approve it.  And--but the FCC has jurisdiction of the FAA but bureaucratic red tape we--we were held up for a few months in which during this time days was money because we had--we had the license but we didn't have a stick.  We didn't have a license, we had the okay that we would get it.  And a friend of mine at WOWO, who was the general manager, told me that if anything he could do, to let him--let me--to tell him, let him know.  And so one of my engineers asked me did I know anybody at WOWO.  They had a tower out there that they wasn't utilizing and we could grandfather into being our tower.
Speaker 2: Yes, now just for the record, WOWO--
Speaker 1: Right--
Speaker 2: --it's a tremendously powerful AM station here in Ft. Wayne [Indiana] and you can pick up a car almost anywhere in the country.
Speaker 1: At one time, you could pick it up--
Speaker 2: WOWO radio--
Speaker 1: Right--
Speaker 2: At one time, anyway.
Speaker 1: Yeah, at one time, you could pick it up and overseas, also overseas.  Fifty thousand watts, one of the last fifty thousand watters in the--in the country.  They don't--you can't get that kind of animal any more.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now, that doesn't work there--
Speaker 2: What, do they dole those out?  How did they (simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Well, during the Second World War, I believe it was, that there wasn't that many radio stations in existence.  So what they did, a few radio stations, they gave fifty thousand watts to so they could get out to areas other than their local area.  For an example, maybe, maybe Iowa, did not have a station that could get out all over the--all over the state.  In parts of Texas in, I believe, in Oklahoma, I know in Texas, they've got a hundred thousand watt station, you know.  But, you know, again, they don't give them out any more because there's so many radio stations out there that are in existence now.
Speaker 2: Okay, so that's the reason.  I often wondered why.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That was it.  WLS in Chicago is a big hundred thousand watt.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, and they're an extinct animal but, you know, a hundred thousand watt station is okay maybe for some national--you might be able to get some national spots out of it, you know, but usually radio station can take care of their market is--is--makes as much money as the station would.  A ten thousand watt station can make as much money as a hundred thousand watt station because when your--when the ratings come out, they only rate you for your immediate area, you know.  The stations in the Chicago area, they are in competition with each other, you know.  They could care less who is listening in--in Milwaukee, you know, because the coverage doesn't mean anything, you know.

Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, we'll go on with your story, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Oh, it's all right, it's all right.  We were talking about WGFX.  Through trial and error, we got it on the air and it was a great day in Ft. Wayne [Indiana].  It's one of the things that will stay in my mind forever.  People were calling each other.  They knew that the equipment was in and I hired the personnel, and we were just waiting for the FCC to give us the okay to hit that knob and put us on the air.  We got the call one week day, I think it was around 11 or 12:00 in the afternoon and we fired that baby up, man, and people were calling the radio station.  People were calling each other and it was just--it was a joyful--you could hear people blowing their horns and stuff.  It was a great thing, you know, when we went on the air.  I kept the radio station from 1980 until 19--no, excuse me, from 1990 to 1999, right at 2000, I sold the station.
Story_ID: 68008
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's still on the air at this time?
Speaker 2: Still on the air and it's got a different format, you know.  It's got a more of a hip hop rap type format.
Speaker 1: Okay, I thought you were going to say country and western, or something like that.
Speaker 2: Well, you know--
Speaker 1: I mean there was a gag in Chicago [Illinois] where--where this April Fool's Day, the local black deejay would--would on one of the stations would announce that they had changed to country and western (simultaneous), yeah.  And the people would call in--
Speaker 2: An April Fool's joke--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, an April Fool's joke.
Speaker 2: --but I was totally--they'd been after me to buy this station--for me to sell them the station and I was at the age that I felt that, you know, I'd been working all my life and I wanted to stop and smell the roses, you know, and do a little traveling and enjoy myself.  And, but my main concern was that we'd built the station from scratch and people enjoyed the format.  People had worked for me from the beginning and I didn't want to lose the format and I didn't want people to lose their job.  And the people that bought the station, they assured me that--that the format would stay the same, nobody would lose their job.  So I finally sold it and I signed the papers at 1:00.  At 1:05 they fired the first person.  Then the next day they fired one or two more.  And so it just went right on down the line.  They let everybody go that worked for me.  I mean everybody.  And then they changed the format to a hip hop, basically rap type of format for--I guess it worked for the younger people but the adults in our community, black as well as white, had no urban station anymore and that bothers me tremendously, it does.  And that's the only--that's the only bad thought I have about being retired.  That--and I felt that I let the community down in a sense that I fought very hard to get the station and I sold it thinking that I was being told the truth, but which I wasn't being told the truth.
Story_ID: 68009
Speaker 1: I suppose it's, you know, it's all commercial, you know.
Speaker 2: Was it sold to some other black entrepreneurs?
Speaker 1: No, it was sold to a white entrepreneur, you know.  And there's no identity as far as the community is concerned.  And I don't know if it will ever happen again and the respect that to have an urban station in Ft. Wayne, they're tremendously hard to get.  The urban station is not the top one on the agendas of people that buy up radio stations unless you're in a large urban market, you know, and Ft. Wayne [Indiana] is not.  It's not a large market.  But it's large enough that a person could make a living and a station could be successful.  I'm living proof of that.  It depends on, you know, how much money a person would want, I suppose.  You know, I can't like country and western.  You can't mess with country and western, right.  But I think there's a bigger need, as far as I'm concerned, as far as the community is concerned, than turning something to country and western or middle of the road or--they got about fifty or sixty different type of formats that you can get into, you know.  But I'm from the old school, you know.  I believe in gospel on Sundays.  I believe in blues on Saturday afternoons.  I believe in Al Jarreau, you know.  I believe in Barry White, you know.  I believe in old school.
Story_ID: 68010
Speaker 1: Yeah. Okay, where were we?
Speaker 2: We were talking about--I was going to ask you about--I was asking about the program (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: --programming, yeah, community--
Speaker 2: --yeah, community affairs program.
Speaker 1: We had--we had a gentleman who happened to be our fifth district councilman, a gentleman by the name of Cletus Edmonds, who had MS [Multiple Sclerosis], who is passed on, now.  But he would do our community affairs on Sundays, Sunday afternoons, and come out in a wheelchair.  Well, they'd pick him up and did a marvelous job for us.  He was--he was controversial enough that you loved him or, you'd never hate him, but you know you disagreed and he was very opinionated.  But it was just the right flavor for our talk show host to have to make people listen and enjoy listening.  And he dealt with everything in the community, you know, and no holds barred.  And great programming.
Speaker 2: So, we're in the black community, we always have issues that need to be aired.  We have a lot of issues and--
Speaker 1: We have.
Speaker 2: --it's good to have a person that can agitate people and--
Speaker 1: We have issues with each other and we have issues with other people.  And I remember one show, in particular, that we were talking about whipping children, you know, like, did you get a whippin' when you were a kid, you know.  Of course, you know, every--most adults did at one time or another, you know.  But people don't do that anymore, you know.  And he--
Speaker 2: Well, some don't, I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Well, yes, as a rule, you know, you don't see it like you used to, you know.  And he was against the switch, you know.  And it was a great show.  And this one older lady called in and she was raising six grandchildren, or something.
Story_ID: 68011
Speaker 1: You were talking about public affairs program--
Speaker 2: Public affairs programming and just radio in general.  I have a--I'm not comfortable with modern urban radio in the sense that--that they--it seemed--well it's a commercial fine, you know, but I believe in the gospel, you know.  I'm not a religious zealot or anything, but I believe that gospel music is part of black radio.  I believe that blues is part of black radio, I mean as well as
Speaker 1: [CAMERA TURNS OFF]
Speaker 2: --that one cut me.  I saw the lightening outside and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know it's--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: So anyway we're rolling again and we're just talking about the different aspects of format for black radio.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I just--I feel that, evidently, that's not a good idea, but I think it is that, black radio should incorporate some gospel on Sundays.  In the Southern communities, you know, and small towns in Alabama and Virginia and West Virginia and Tennessee, you can hear this type of music on Sunday mornings, you know, that--I think that the community would really enhance and really embrace it, the same way with some jazz on Sundays, you know, and some heavy soul, not--maybe not the, you know, the real low down blues but some heavy soul to be incorporated with the formats, you know.
Speaker 1: I think a lot of stations are doing oldies too on Sundays.
Speaker 2: The oldies--the oldies--
Speaker 1: Doing drive time--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  The oldies are great.  I listen to an oldies station in Atlanta.  I can't think of the name of it and I--I'm just overwhelmed, you know.  Of course it kind of dates you but I'm overwhelmed with the oldies station.  If I ever got back into the business, that's what I would shoot for, an oldies station.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you got Chicago [Illinois] is Herb Kent [HM] and then--
Speaker 2: Herb Kent--
Speaker 1: And New York is Hal Jackson [HM]--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --who's about 87 years old now who does it, oldies.
Speaker 2: Yeah I listen to--I listened to Herb Kent about a week or two ago.  Herb Kent the something Gent--
Speaker 1: The Cool Gent--
Speaker 2: Cool Gent, yes.  I was on the way to Michigan City and Herb's been around for a long time.
Story_ID: 68012
Speaker 1: Now--do you have a--so you do a show, now?  You have a show that you're basically retired.  You--
Speaker 2: No, I don't, I don't.  I'm just basically retired and--
Speaker 1: Okay, so you don't do the jazz show that you were talking about?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I--at one part of my career, I donated a--four hours a week to a jazz show for the public radio here.  That was before I went into--to radio for myself.  I had a cable radio station at the time.  But I'm retired and, believe it or not, retired--being retired is not easy.  Being retired is a job.  First--first few weeks, you know--I--well the first thing I did, I took the alarm clock and threw it far as I could, away from my house.  I don't need it any more, you know.  I get up when I want to, you know.  Go to bed when you're sleepy.  Eat when you're hungry, you know.  After a few months of that, that gets a little old.  You have to have something to do, you know.  I picked up about thirty pounds, you know.  Eating, getting on the couch.  Talk about a couch potato, you know.  But I joined this health club and I play a lot of golf, I stay active and I've got a Jackie Gleason wardrobe, now, you know.  I got--I got outfits that I wore when I was forty-two in the waist, I'm down to thirty-eight now and so this is the first time I've had this shirt on, these pants on in quite some time.  But, being retired is not as easy as it's cranked up to be.  At least it hasn't meant for me.  I have to work at it, you know.  You can form some bad habits by--with idle mind and idle time.
Story_ID: 68013
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and aspirations for the black community here in Ft. Wayne?  I mean, you're really at--having a radio station really put you at the pulse of what's going on, I would think and--
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  Well, the hopes and aspirations is to have another one, if not me, someone else, have another radio station similar to what I was doing.  We are basically in the dark as far as what's going on in the community and outside the community because we did give as well as local news, we gave national news also from the black perspective, you know.  That would be--that would be my biggest wish on the wish list, that we would--could do another urban station and similar to what we were doing in the past when I had the station.  Other than that, I feel that this community is a little stagnant and it might dovetail back to lack of communication.  A lot of people don't know what the other people are doing, you know, in the community, whether it's good, bad or indifferent.  It's the lack of communication.  I'd like to see more of that in the future.
Story_ID: 68014
Speaker 1: Okay. And with your business enterprises and so forth, what do you see as your legacy here in Ft. Wayne?
Speaker 2: Gee, you know it's--you know it's like--like (unclear) said, you know, Louie blow your own horn.  I have a hard time really doing that but, you know, I would hope that--that there are people that will remember that you can do--if you put your mind to a project and you can do it, you know.  There are obstacles out there, man.  There's no short cuts, there's no silver spoons, there's no easy way to do it, you know.  It's hard knocks and keeping your nose to the grindstone is--its--I would like to leave people with the idea that I stayed with it, you know, against great odds.  I was blessed to have a successful clothing store, a successful cable radio station and a successful FM radio station.  And it was a swimming upstream all the way, all the way.  But the satisfaction--the satisfaction that I receive is worth all the tea in China, really.  Just knowing it can be done, you know, and doing something that has never been done in the community, you know.  No one had had a full-fledged clothing store or a cable radio station or an FM station geared primarily for the black community and they can take that and dovetail it into doing whatever they want to do, you know.  Whatever business or venture they want to get into.  You can do it because it's never been done before, does not mean that it can't be done.
Story_ID: 68015
Speaker 1: Okay. Did your parents get a chance to see you become successful?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  My mom [Mary Mable Dinwiddie] did.  My dad [James Arthur Dinwiddie] passed away before I got the cable station.  I still had the clothing store.  He had an opportunity to see me in business.  My mom has only been gone for about four years, I guess.  And she had the opportunity to see me open up the radio station and was at the grand opening and the whole nine yards.  Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, is she very proud of you?
Speaker 2: I think that she was.  Yeah, she was, you know, and I was in my sixties then and, you know, I was still her little boy.  Every time I--she's lived at the Senior Citizen's complex and every time I'd go by to see her, she had dragged me through there and, you know, she wanted the ladies to meet her little boy, you know, and she was extremely proud.

Speaker 1: During one of the breaks, we were changing tapes that your mother played softball, semi-pro softball.
Speaker 2: It was a softball team that, yes, a softball team that Wilson's Chicken Shack, one of the first entrepreneurs in Ft. Wayne, Carl Wilson, Senior, sponsored this all-Afro American women's softball team.  And they were pretty good.  They were pretty good.  My mom--my mom played on that.
Story_ID: 68017
Speaker 1: I know you seem awful young for, you know, I guess you got some other things that you can probably--and you're retired, I know, but how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I don't think that--I don't really feel that God is through with me yet, you know.  I'm 68, okay.  I don't feel 68.  My body does at times, but my mind says, you know, Louie, you still got--you got a few miles left.  I'm at that crossroads, again, like in my younger days.  I wanna go another direction.  I don't quite know, right, where.  I'm not through.  I enjoy retirement but I don't love retirement.  I don't.  I thought I did.  I thought I would, you know, I really did and you know you work all your life and you say, hey, man, you know, a few more years, you know, I can hang it up, you know, and I can work in the garden, I'd do the flowers, you know.  No, no, that's--I gotta stay in the action and I don't think I'd be truly happy till I get back in the action.
Story_ID: 68018
Speaker 1: Do you have a family that you--
Speaker 2: I have--I have my wife, Joan.  I have two children who live in Atlanta, they're twins, Randy and Rhonda.  They're forty years old and they love Atlanta [Georgia].  My wife wants to move down there to be close to the kids and I tell her we just got rid of the kids a few years ago, you know.  Let them stay there and come back and visit, you know.  But, I'll probably be here.  I'll probably be in Ft. Wayne from now.  And if I don't move to Arizona, that's kind of my--kind of in the back of my mind if I move anywhere, it'd be out in the Phoenix [Arizona] area.  Atlanta's nice to visit but I just--I'm kind of a small town guy, you know.  I love my kids but let them stay in Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Okay, well thank you very much.

Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  And if you could just give us a description of the photo, we create a still image.  From this we do a frame graph and we just want to caption materials so, who, when and where, basically.
Speaker 2: Okay, this Louis Dinwiddie, known as "Louie D" in the local circles.  This picture was taken in 1980, when I first opened up WGFX, Foxy 107.9, the first urban radio station in Ft. Wayne.
