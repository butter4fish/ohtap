Speaker 1: So I'll begin by saying I'm [HistoryMaker] Harriette Cole for The HistoryMakers.  I will be the interviewer today.  Matthew Hickey is our videographer.  We are interviewing Reverend Dr. James Forbes [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. James A. Forbes, Jr.], and I'd like for you to say and spell your name and tell us where we are and what date.
Speaker 2: My name is James Forbes, J-A-M-E-S, F-O-R-B-E-S, and we're at Union Theological Seminary in the office of the Drum Major Institute and this is Wednesday.
Speaker 1: September 21, 2016.
Speaker 2: Yes, we're at the Drum Major Institute in New York City [New York, New York] at Union Theological Seminary and this is Wednesday, September the 21st, 2016.
Speaker 1: Excellent.
Story_ID: 664418
Speaker 1: So I'd like to start with what we call People magazine type questions.  What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: I'm, I'm difficult.  I guess, you know what, why don't I go ahead and say, since I'm a preacher I'm gonna go ahead with chicken.
Speaker 1: Very good and y- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The gospel bird.
Speaker 1: The gospel bird.  And what about your favorite color?
Speaker 2: I believe brown, largely because people used to ask me to dress so it matches my eyes, which were somewhat brown.
Speaker 1: Your favorite season of the year?
Speaker 2: I think maybe autumn.
Speaker 1: Do you have a vaca- a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No, I've not been able to choose one, but the places I've enjoyed the most, we used to go to Hilton Head, South Carolina, and walk the beach, didn't do much swimming.
Speaker 1: It's a big flat beach, so nice.
Speaker 2: Big flat beach, we enjoyed that.  Being from North Carolina, that was as close as I could get.
Speaker 1: And your, do you have a favorite saying or phrase?
Speaker 2: All things work together for good is my favorite statement, and I kind of live by that as well.
Story_ID: 664419
Speaker 1: And what is your birth date?
Speaker 2: My birth date is September 6, 1935.
Speaker 1: Ex- and you, where were you born?
Speaker 2: I was born in Burgaw, North Carolina.  Now the only way you know where that is, that's in Pender County [North Carolina].  It's about twenty-five miles from Wilmington, North Carolina.  Everybody will know where Wilmington, maybe not everybody will know where Burgaw, B-U-R-G-A-W.
Speaker 1: Excellent.  So I'd like to talk to you about your family, and we'll talk about your mother's side and your father's [James A. Forbes, Sr.] side, but let's start with your mother.  Could you tell me her name, when she was born, where she was born, tell me about her.
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Mabel Clemons Forbes.  Now we argue, how do you spell it?  Is it M-A-B-E-L or M-A-B-L-E.  She spelled it M-A-B-E-L, others said it should be spelled M-A-B-L-E, but she said it's M-A-B-E-L, that's the way it is (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: She was born in Pitt County, North Carolina, and the city was--it wasn't a city, a little village called Stokes, North Carolina.  She was born in 1912, September 18th, and she was born to Rosa Forbes [sic.], well Rosa Clemons and Orange Clemons, O.C. Clemons is what he was called.  They were farmers in Stokes, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: And Stokes you've called a village, so do you know what the population was back then?  I mean how many farms were there?
Speaker 2: Oh, Stokes was a--let me--it was a crossroads, okay, but they did eventually have a little school down there, but I don't think, I don't even, I know they used to have a little crossroads where we would go to buy ice cream during the summer months after we were putting in tobacco, but I don't think, I don't know whether anybody would ever even guess what the population of that little village was.  It was a sprawled out farming community with a little crossroads store called Stokes, North Carolina, but that was just about all there was of Stokes, until there was a school, later on named for my grandfather, which was Clemons Grove School [ph.], and then there was a Clemons Grove church [Clemons Grove Pentecostal Church, Stokes, North Carolina], but the idea of saying what the population was--let's, let's just say it was a great community but don't ask me for statistics about it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay (laughter).
Story_ID: 664420
Speaker 1: And now you mentioned tobacco. Was that the primary plant that was farmed there or?
Speaker 2: My [maternal] grandfather [O.C. Clemons] was a tobacco farmer, big tobacco farmer.
Speaker 1: Did you help with hanging and drying the leaves and everything (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Every summer when we were out of school in Raleigh, North Carolina, we'd pack up and go down to Stokes [North Carolina], to grandfa- grandpa's farm to help, help put in tobacco.
Speaker 1: That's what it was called, put in.  And what did that mean?  Describe putting in tobacco.
Speaker 2: Putting in tobacco was, (clears throat) excuse me, okay, so the tobacco grows. You get there in time to help it to grow and part of helping it to grow is as tobacco plants grow, but in the middle edges between the leaves there was some extraneous growths.  We call those suckles, so one of the things you do, you get there in time to suckle tobacco.  Suckle, move--
Speaker 1: Heard that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) you walk through the tobacco field removing the extraneous growth, sort of like little leaves that would sap the energy from the full tobacco leaf, so you suckled the tobacco.  Secondly, you get a chance to worm the tobacco.  Worm tobacco, tobacco had those, tobacco worms look like caterpillars with a horn, and your job was to go through the field because they would eat up the leaves and you had to take the worms off. And so it--
Speaker 1: You were human pesticide.
Speaker 2: We were human pesticides as we took the worms, put 'em into a cup or can or something like that.
Speaker 1: And what did you do with them?
Speaker 2: Extermination.
Speaker 1: There was no, you couldn't--
Speaker 2: There was no use for them.
Speaker 1: Use for them other--okay.
Speaker 2: Right, and it, you know, you wait until the tobacco was up and fully grown and when it was ripe, then you get started in the process of actually harvesting the tobacco and everybody had a job.  Our job was to crap, we called it crap tobacco.  That means we would start on the fields and we would take the first two or three leaves that were ripened, because it ripe- it ripens up, so the first week you take two or three leaves, put it in a truck, and--
Speaker 1: And these were large leaves, were they not?
Speaker 2: Large leaves, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.  What color were they when they--
Speaker 2: Green, but yellow, they were green but beginning to yellow.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: That's how you knew it was ripe.
Speaker 2: Well, the farmer knew it was time to go (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 664421
Speaker 1: Then you take them on a truck, a mule would be dragging a truck, you put the tobacco in, then the truck would go to the shed or the barn, tobacco barn, and in the tobacco barn you had the opportunity to take a stick and the loopers would string the tobacco, they had a fancy way of how they could string the tobacco (gestures) so that the leaves would be hung up in the tobacco barn and could be cured to get ready to be taken to the warehouse where they could be auctioned off at the best possible price.  And, of course, depending upon how old you were, at first you simply hand the tobacco, so when the truck came in, the ladies who were doing the looping the tobacco, you would hand them the tobacco.  They'd take it from your hands, and (gestures) and so--but if you got to be big, you got the chance to drive the truck.  You got a little older you got a chance to crop or crap tobacco, and at the end of the day you had a chance to hang the tobacco in the barns, so you call them tier poles.  You stand and they hand you a stick of tobacco and you place it so that at the end of the day after all this, if you were on the bottom tier pole, you were supposed to be pretty good because you take the tobacco and then hand it up, so you take it up, hand it up. Or when the day was over the big job was having the opportunity to put the fire in because this was flue cured tobacco and you put fire in it to raise the temperature so that a progressive increase of the temperature would appropriately cure the tobacco so it was just right.  The more golden it is, the better price it brings at the market.
Speaker 2: And the market, was it in town, or did the leaves have to be ridden to a bigger town?
Speaker 1: Not in Stokes [North Carolina].  It would be taken to a larger town.  So we in Stokes, we had to go to Greenville [North Carolina]--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --or go to Rocky Mount [North Carolina], some of the largest, cities that did have populations that you could count, (laughter) right.  Fascinating thing in my memory is that I experienced something at night during the tobacco harvesting season.  So you stay awake because when the wood, that is before they had oil cured furnaces, you put the wood in that were (unclear) inside the barn that kept the temperature up.  You had a thermometer to make sure you kept it steady, so you were watching all night long.  (Clears throat) Excuse me.  One night I was sitting there and I watched and saw the following thing.  There was a cricket that was hopping, was hopping fast.  There was a frog after the cricket who was hopping to get at the cricket.  The frog, and you wouldn't believe this, so you don't have to believe it even now.  The frog flicks out his tongue to catch the cricket.  There's a pomalee [sic. popalee] snake who at the very moment that the frog had flicked out his tongue to catch the cricket, the pomalee snake swallows the frog whole.  Now what does that say to you about life?  You talk about dog eat dog, crickets hopping, frogs hopping and the pomalee snake pops the frog.
Speaker 2: And how old were you when you witnessed this?
Speaker 1: Somewhere between eight and nine years old.
Speaker 2: And were you by yourself or were there other kids around?
Speaker 1: There were other people in and around at night.
Speaker 2: But you saw it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tobacco barn was a fun time 'cause what we go, we'd go and steal watermelon from somebody's field, or either we'd go and get potatoes and roast the potatoes in the fire there.  It was, it was a relaxation at the end of the day.
Speaker 2: And this occurred I'm assuming end of season, is that in autumn?
Speaker 1: The end of autumn.
Speaker 2: End of autumn (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Harvesting time.
Story_ID: 664422
Speaker 1: This is your mother's [Mabel Clemons Forbes] family that's in--
Speaker 2: Stokes, North Carolina (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in Stokes, North Carolina.  How far can you trace your mother's family back?
Speaker 2: Really it's only about--O.C. Clemons [Forbes' maternal grandfather] and Rosie Clemons [Forbes' maternal grandmother, Rosa Clemons], that's all I knew, except there's a family cemetery right across from Clemons Grove.  His name was Clemons.  He gave the money to build the school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then they had a Clemons Grove church [Clemons Grove Pentecostal Church, Stokes, North Carolina].  Right across is the cemetery and on some family union- reunion opportunities, we'd go by, so we could pick up a little bit from the cemetery about who his father was and who her, her mother was.  My sister, Anna Towns [Anna Forbes Towns], has actually sent in to do the genealogy so they know a lot.  So fundamentally, we just know that we were kids who had as a grandfather, a well off black farmer.  They used to call him Mr. Big Orange--
Speaker 1: Mr. Big Orange
Speaker 2: --Big Orange, 'cause he's a big man.  He was the kind of guy who has, they started riding Buicks, my grandfather, every year they'd come and get his old Buick and bring him a new one 'cause he had to have the latest of what's going on.  And a wonderful house there that--
Speaker 1: What was his house at?
Speaker 2: His house was like, oh, you want me to tell you just how you said it, his house was like a, a mansion sitting in the middle of a field, had gables.  We had two outhouses that had some style about them.  Isn't that something, an outhouse with style, you know.  It was a house that had a large eating space, then it had a living room that had glass doors and that was only for very, very, very special occasions.  I don't know why he called it, it was called the dormy room.  What do that mean?  I don't know.  It just, that was very, very special, then there were upstairs bedrooms for each members of the family, a wonderful kitchen that we all enjoyed coming home from the fields to see what Mama Ada [Ada Clemons (ph.)], that was later on his second wife, Mama Ada had prepared for us.  It was a, it was a special place, it's a little bit of heaven let down on earth, grandpa's big house.
Story_ID: 664423
Speaker 1: And tell me about your father, his name, please spell it for me, when was he born, tell me about him.
Speaker 2: My daddy is James Forbes [James A. Forbes, Sr.] and he's James Alexander Forbes, and, of course, as we kids were born, he became Sr.  He was born in Greenville, North Carolina.  He was born March the 19th, two thousand- I mean 1914 to Anna Forbes and Charlie Forbes.  Now Anna Forbes is the one we know because by the time we were born, Charlie Forbes, who had raised five or six kids, just disappeared, he just walked away and left the family.  Efforts were made to find where he went, and there may be somebody who hears this story that would say we know where Charlie Forbes went, but we traced him as best we could.  Is it Norfolk, Virginia, is it, what part of North Carolina?  Did he end up in Tennessee?  We do not know.
Speaker 1: Well when he left how many children were there?
Speaker 2: They must have had six or seven children, and my father had to drop out of school.
Speaker 1: Was he the eldest?
Speaker 2: He was not the eldest, next to eldest was he?  He had to drop out of school in order to help take care of the family.  He was at the time in the sixth grade.  So he developed a sense of fatherly responsibility in helping his mother take care of the rest of the family.  He was quite a young man because he had this extra responsibility.
Story_ID: 664424
Speaker 1: At a certain age he [Forbes' father, James A. Forbes, Sr.] decided he was gonna be a preacher.  So he accepted the call to ministry, and became a preacher, quite a popular preacher in North Carolina.  Big problem was that he was a preacher, but if you recall the term bootleg preacher, he didn't have any education.   You know, dropped out at sixth grade.
Speaker 2: So that's what bootleg preacher means?
Speaker 1: The jackleg, jackleg--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --jackleg, bootleg preacher--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --basically it tended to suggest that they had not been thoroughly trained for the vocation.  So one of the churches said, "We really like your preaching, but if you're gonna be our preacher, you're gonna have to get some education."  So, having dropped out at the sixth grade, he enrolled in high school with a correspondence course called the American School [American School of Correspondence, Lansing, Illinois], in Chicago [sic.].  And actually, I remember as a little boy, taking his lessons that he prepared at the dining room table and posting them in the mail box and also picking up his, the letters when he got his grades back.  He completed high school with only having gone to sixth grade through correspondence. But he was sufficiently bright that in finishing high school by correspondents he enrolled in college at Shaw University [Raleigh, North Carolina].  At Shaw University he became, he graduated the head of his class and also decided to go further to get his, what they called then B.D. degree, bachelor of divinity, which is now called M.Div. degree, master of divinity, but he, you know, graduated at the head of the class (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Do you know what time this was?
Speaker 1: My father might have gotten his degree from Shaw University around about 1949.
Speaker 2: Okay. And what work was he doing as he was preparing for the ministry?
Speaker 1: As he was preparing for the ministry in North Carolina, in Goldsboro, North Carolina, he had a job working at the W.T. Grants department store [sic. W.T. Grant].  He was a porter and had the responsibility, and candy salesman.  This is a, this is a very important thing.  My father always viewed himself as being not just a worker for somebody, so although he's a porter, and a candy salesman in a W.T. Grants department store, when the head of the store, whose name at the time was Mr. Parsons [ph.], when he announced to the staff that he had just had a little baby girl, my father made a table with four chairs, for the little baby.  Now how do I know this?  Because later on, years later, I'm preaching at Memorial Drive Presbyterian Church in Houston, Texas, and they put the name of the preacher over the street, kind of build it up, it's gonna be a big occasion, and a person named Mrs. Parsons came with her children and she said she heard James Forbes, she just wanted to know if I'm the James Forbes because she was the daughter for whom the table and the chairs had been made by a James Forbes  and that wherever her family went they could leave anything behind, but they could never leave behind the table that James Forbes had made for her.  Here's a black man to show his sense of care for his employer, a white man.  He's not a worker, he's a servant of God to show love to whomever he could, but that was a fascinating thing to, to live long enough to have that circle completed.
Story_ID: 664425
Speaker 1: How far back can you trace your father's family?  Can you, can you go back to slavery? Do you--
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't have--Anna [Forbes' sister, Anna Forbes Towns] might be able--Anna's genealogy--
Speaker 1: Your sister.
Speaker 2: --might do that and I've never taken time to really look deeply into it.  We all knew that we were slaves, the only way, you know, if you want some proof, my name is Forbes, F-O-R-B-E-S, but it turns out that I was receiving an honorary doctorate at Fairleigh Dickerson school [sic. Fairleigh Dickinson University, Teaneck, New Jersey], a university, and one of the persons who was receiving another honorary degree was Malcolm Forbes, but his was posthumous because he had passed before.  So Robert Forbes was there to receive it, and I teased him.  I said, "You know what, where are you from?"  "Pitt County [North Carolina]," so these people, so, so I'll tell you, see we can check it out.  Pitt County where the Forbeses were big plantation owners, I suspect, I tell him, "You know what, I'm confused because I think the way the name was written at first was F-O-R-B-apostrophe-S, the Forb's, or either F-O-R-B-E-S with an apostrophe behind, that when emancipation came, maybe you all removed the apostrophe, but we, we know that we were the Forbes'," and so--
Speaker 1: How did he respond to that?
Speaker 2: He wiped the sweat from his brow at the very thought of this, so I told him, "That's okay, one of these days I'm going to develop the other Forbes foundation, and we had spiritual and moral capital that has made a contribution to the world as well.  You'd be proud of the offspring of your parents' labor."
Speaker 1: That must have been--that was certainly more than he expected when coming to accept that award.
Speaker 2: Right, I mean, but, but, yes.
Speaker 1: Good for you.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 664426
Speaker 1: Now how did your parents meet, do you know?
Speaker 2: I don't know how they met.  I would assume that it had to do with church, since O.C. Clemons [Forbes' maternal grandfather] was a minister, my father [James A. Forbes, Sr.] became an outstanding minister, I am assuming that in one or the other of his campaigns, he had the opportunity to meet the young ladies, et cetera, and that's where he met my mother [Mabel Clemons Forbes].
Speaker 1: And do you know when they married and where they lived after they were married?
Speaker 2: They married at Holy Trinity church [Holy Trinity United Holy Church] in Greenville, North Carolina, and they lived in that general Greenville area.
Speaker 1: And how many--
Speaker 2: Pitt County [North Carolina].
Story_ID: 664427
Speaker 1: How many siblings do you have?
Speaker 2: There are--there were eight Forbes children born to James [James A. Forbes, Sr.] and Mabel Forbes [Mabel Clemons Forbes].
Speaker 1: And where do you fit in line?
Speaker 2: I'm the second eldest.
Speaker 1: Tell me the names and what you--a little bit about each of your siblings.
Speaker 2: The eldest was Evangeline, Evangeline Richardson [Evangeline Forbes Richardson], she finally came to be called.  She was a big sis, she was a teacher, wonderful early education childhood teacher.  She grew up developing her skills at Shaw University [Raleigh, North Carolina] and then later on came to Teacher's College [Teachers College, Columbia University, New York, New York] and trained and later on teached at both City College [City College of New York]--
Speaker 1: In New York [New York].
Speaker 2: --in New York and at Bank Street School [Bank Street School for Children, New York, New York], so Evangeline was quite an instructor in early childhood education.  She married a guy from London [England], Gerald Richardson [sic. Gerard Richardson], and they produced a son, Cy Richardson, who now works for the Urban League [National Urban League], but so Van's number one. I'm number two, second kid. Then I, Gwendolyn Towns [Gwendolyn Forbes Towns] is the next sibling and she became an educator as well.  She went to A and T College [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University] in Greensboro, North Carolina, and she had the distinction of meeting there Edolphus Towns who becomes the congressman in Brooklyn [New York], so Gwen and Edolphus, Gwen continued to teach for a while and then became the congressman's wife and that kind of gave her a different kind of vocation, but she loved teaching.
Speaker 1: Did they have children?
Speaker 2: Yes, Darryl [Darryl C. Towns] is the oldest son and Darryl also became a politician like his father, became the New York assemblyman, then worked at the department of housing with the State of New York [New York State Homes and Community Renewal] under Governor Cuomo [Andrew Cuomo] and from there they, he has accepted a job working as an executive with American Airlines [American Airlines, Inc.].  They also have Deidra [Deidra Towns] who is another daughter who is an educator who worked in volunteer work with hospitals, et cetera.  By the way, Gwen, the mother, became, when she became the congressman's wife, she became a wonderful volunteer with the hospitals in the Brooklyn area.  So, but anyway.
Story_ID: 664428
Speaker 1: You were telling me about your family.
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I think we're at number four.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  The next to Gwen [Gwendolyn Forbes Towns] is David [David Forbes].  David is the son who was very unusual.  He became an educator.  David--you're picking up a trend here that all of our--
Speaker 1: In one way or another.
Speaker 2: We are service oriented people.  So David went to Shaw University [Raleigh, North Carolina] and got a degree in education and became a teacher and eventually a principal in North Carolina, and he also decided that he wanted to do a Ph.D. and went to the University of Virginia [Charlottesville, Virginia].  He did work at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] at the Upward Bound program. C. Eric Lincoln impressed him, so he started his Ph.D. at the University of Virginia although C. Eric Lincoln later on shifted to Duke University [Durham, North Carolina].  So David after having completed all of his work, so he's the ABD [all but dissertation], chose at the weirdest time not to complete his Ph.D., but to become a minister.  I remember his coming to Washington, D.C. to talk to me about that.  Say, "What, you were that close," but he felt called to be a minister.  So he accepted the call to the ministry and became a minister working out of Richmond, Virginia, and eventually became the pastor of Martin Street Baptist Church in North, in Raleigh, North Carolina, and then later on developed his own church, Christian Faith Baptist Church in Raleigh, North Carolina, and had the great distinction, so much so until as he developed his own ministry he took special interest in what they call the Lott Carey missionary convention [Lott Carey Foreign Mission Convention] and he became an educator himself, but since he had already done doctoral studies up to the completion of that work, he became a part of the team at United Theological Seminary and became one of the leaders of the D.Min program at Dayton [Ohio] at the United Theological Seminary to help train other people.  He received his D.Min degree and then taught in the D.Min program and eventually, after he retired from his position at Christian Faith Baptist Church he, for a couple of years, served as the interim dean of the school of religion at Shaw University [Shaw University Divinity School, Raleigh, North Carolina].  Of course now, he's retired now.  Next was Effie, Effie West, she--Effie Forbes West.  She was an educator.  She was a Spanish teacher.  She had first worked in business at cyanide company, Union Cyanide is it, is it Union Carbide [Union Carbide Corporation]?
Speaker 1: Union Carbide.
Speaker 2: Union Carbide, not cyanide.  Please, excuse me.  Union Carbide as his business person.  Then she worked as an educational counselor at George Washington High School [George Washington Educational Campus] in the Bronx [New York] and she had a program they called the SPARK program trying to take disadvantaged youth and give them a real sense of why education was important.  Effie spoke Spanish fluently and she is known as the Spanish teacher, and we always thought she's going to be an interpreter at the United Nations, though she never did.
Story_ID: 664429
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But so your family, while--well your father went back to school much later--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --but when you all were first growing up, both of your parents [Mabel Clemons Forbes and James A. Forbes, Sr.] were uneducated.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: And all of their children are college educated (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Had to.  Let's say like this, can you believe this that my father graduated from school, from Shaw [Shaw University, Raleigh, North Carolina], about the same time that the other sisters and brothers, because he had to come back--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --to go to school as they were up, growing up in age.  But it was very clear that just as morning is the first part, but the day isn't completed until you end the day and come to night, you go school, college, is as natural as morning to night, so in our family everybody managed to get beyond college and I think most of us had advanced degrees because education was one of the ways in which we honored--I mean if you got a daddy who, with seven kids, goes back to college--
Speaker 1: You have no excuse (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) what excuse do you have not finding a way--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --to complete your education?  So it's a no brainer.
Story_ID: 664430
Speaker 1: Most of your siblings went to Shaw, but you went to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well let's see.
Speaker 1: How did that choice come to be?
Speaker 2: Well the--before that one, you see because I haven't told you that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay, please.
Speaker 2: --let me give you the rest, and then--see because that--I talked about David [David Forbes] and then I talked about Effie [Effie Forbes West].  Effie broke the mold.  She went to Morgan State [Morgan College; Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland].  Okay.  Near Baltimore [Maryland], and so somehow, not everybody had to be bound to daddy's place at Shaw University [Raleigh, North Carolina], so Effie did her work at Morgan State.  Then the next sister is Anna [Anna Forbes Towns] who also went to Morgan State, and Anna became a lawyer because after Morgan she then went to Howard law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.].  So Anna became a lawyer and she lives in Silver Springs, Maryland now.  Again, so just when you thought--
Speaker 1: Not everyone went to Shaw (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) just when you thought Shaw University was the key, there are others that went the other way.  Barbara [Barbara Forbes Carr], who is the next sister to Anna, went to university, to North Carolina, NC, University of North Carolina at Durham [North Carolina College at Durham; North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina].  That's where she did her work.
Speaker 1: Is that also a black college [historically black college or university]?
Speaker 2: It's a black college and she became a librarian.  So that's where she did her work, so, now I named most of 'em.  The other one after that is Ronald [Ronald Forbes].  Ronnie had a strange name, 'cause now Mabel Forbes [Forbes' mother, Mabel Clemons Forbes] is thinking that this thing called giving birth is getting to be kind of, it's getting to be too much.  So she named him Ronald O. Forbes.  Guess what the O stands for?  Omega, the last one.  This is it, you know, so Ronnie was the last one.  He graduated from high school here in New York City [New York, New York] because my father [James A. Forbes, Sr.] had moved from North Carolina to New York.  He went to Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and when he graduated from Harvard he wanted to go to med school, so he went to Columbia for med school [Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York], then he went to the [U.S.] Air Force to become an air force doctor, and then down to Langley Air Force field [Langley Air Force Base, Virginia] to develop his, he became a psychiatrist.  So Ronnie's a psychiatrist in Virginia and so that's pretty much the Forbes clan.  Now I have not been fair.  I've not said that each of them has beautiful mate, and I didn't take time to give you all of that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No but that's okay.  This is your story.
Speaker 2: All right, okay, okay.
Speaker 1: I want to keep it moving.
Speaker 2: All right, okay, sure (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So we--we blessed the whole family and know that if we--
Speaker 2: Bless them all.
Speaker 1: --if we could we would tell everyone's story--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but, but we can't.
Story_ID: 664431
Speaker 1: So let's go to you as a--when it's time for you to decide where you're going to go to college, you, you choose Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], correct (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: And how do you come to that choice?
Speaker 2: Easy.  Number one, in high school [George Washington High School; Washington Graded and High School, Raleigh, North Carolina] I had a crush on my chemistry teacher.  She happened to be the wife of our family doctor, Nelson Perry.  Her name was Susan Vick Perry [Susie Vick Perry], so I figured in my childhood delusions that if she liked doctors, then I ought to be a doctor.  Come on.  So I decided I'm gonna be a doctor.  In my day, graduating in 1953, the chances of your getting a position in a major med school would not be as great as if you choose either Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] or Howard.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Howard had a little more appeal because it's north.  I didn't want to go further south.  So I wanted to go to Howard so that I could do pre-med, then go to med school and fulfill my aspiration in that regard.  So that's why I went to Howard.
Speaker 1: Excellent.
Story_ID: 664432
Speaker 1: Before we get to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] I want to go backwards one moment and ask you when you were--well if you go as far back as you can remember, what is your earliest memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory is my mother [Mabel Clemons Forbes] holding one of my younger siblings as the firemen are coming through our living room to go to the bathroom because I loved to see the sparkle at the end of the umbrella.  The umbrella, when you struck it against the pot by the stove just gave off beautiful sparks and I (makes sound). But the spark became a fire. But being a precocious kid, I figured the best thing to do was to get this fire out of the house, so I go to the bathroom which had a curtain on it, so as I'm putting the fire out of the window, it catches on fire.  So the house is on fire.  My mother is standing at the door and, and--
Speaker 1: How old are you?
Speaker 2: I guess I must be about maybe four, maybe four years old or something like that.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That is a memory.
Speaker 2: You would think that might be, that--that might stick, right?
Speaker 1: I think so (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was a traumatic moment. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: That--that sounds like one.
Story_ID: 664433
Speaker 1: So thinking of fonder memories, now this may be at the home where you grew up with your parents [Mabel Clemons Forbes and James A. Forbes, Sr.] or maybe your [maternal] grandfather's [O.C. Clemons] farm [in Stokes, North Carolina], but wherever you remember your, your growing up time, what are the sights, sounds and smells that you remember as a child?
Speaker 2: Okay.  The sight, it's a few things, you know, in the back of our yard in Goldsboro, North Carolina, is a beautiful cherry tree, so two trees in North Carolina, just warms the spirit.  One is to go climbing up that tree to just eat cherries from the top of that cherry tree, or go down the road a bit to the buckeye field, which was a plum orchard.  Let me tell you, child if you've never been to a plum orchard when the plums are ripe, and to smell the, the aroma of the ripened plums, then you ought to be born again and come back and try it.  So, so I recall that, the plums and the cherries, that's a beautiful sight.  Smell, after a day of work at the grandfather's farm, we come home, clean up, but upon entering the house, Mama Ada [Ada Clemons (ph.)], that was his second wife, Ada, Mama Ada would have the house just fragrant with the smell of parched peanuts.  As she would roast those peanuts, in the shell, but when you got there, it was all you could, then she put them in individual little boxes, little cartons. And caviar, what's that?  Caviar is nothing compared to the taste and smell of the wonderful peanuts roasted as a kind of sort of special token for the hard work you had done through the day.  Of course, we ate our regular meals, but, that's fine. But anyway, those were some of the, the things.
Story_ID: 664434
Speaker 1: And when in, in Goldsboro [North Carolina], Goldsboro is now a larger town--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --correct?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Is it considered a--like what size city is it?
Speaker 2: I would say Goldsboro is a moderate sized city.  It's not as large as Raleigh [North Carolina] but it, it's the city where the Seymour Johnson Air Force Base [Goldsboro, North Carolina] is, so it's a, it's a moderate sized southern town.
Speaker 1: So growing up in Goldsboro, if that's where you--
Speaker 2: We actually started out, I went to my first school at School Street school [School Street Elementary School] in Goldsboro, North Carolina, just for one year before we moved to Raleigh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And Raleigh is where you spent most of your time.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: These are both southern cities and we're talking about, in the--what years are we talking about?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was born in 1935.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So from '35 [1935] to '42 [1942] we were in Goldsboro.  In '42 [1942] we moved to Raleigh and stayed there from '42 [1942] to '60 [1960].
Speaker 1: So do you remember race relations during that time?  Do you remember a divide between the black community and the white community as you were growing up?
Speaker 2: You know, my parents did so much to protect us from the jagged edges of segregated society that we, we, we learned to live on our side of town, I'll just say that.  We were aware that things were different and the most serious manifestation of that difference I think maybe you got it in school.  For example, when you went to school, one of the things you used to do, I don't know whether you all did, as you go to the bookroom to pick up books at a particular time, that feels strange.  But we'd go and go into the bookroom and to pick up books and to see that all of the books had first been used by people across town at the white school.  That was, that's kind of weird.  Only now and then I comple- I even tried to wonder, did we ever see any new books?  We didn't see any new books, these are books that the white kids had used across town.  We were aware of that, but the more serious issue in that period regarding race, had to do with my mother [Mabel Clemons Forbes] who was, although she managed to go to the ninth grade, was such a wonderfully educated and leadership providing person in our community.  My mother had in Goldsboro and in first years in Raleigh, she was a domestic and dad [James A. Forbes, Sr.] is working.  By the time he reached Raleigh he's a full time pastor so he's no longer working at Grant's [W.T. Grant].  My mother would, with seven kids, and finally eight, would get up, get us ready to go to school, then she, after getting us ready, would get on a bus and go across town to work for a white family as a domestic.  It became clear at a certain point that the reason she worked as a domestic is because she had to take care of the family that she worked for because the mother of that family was a worker at Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] as a receptionist.  Now my mother was making thirty-five dollars a week, five days, seven dollars, yeah, thirty-five dollars a week.  Somewhere we got it and it may not even be true, that, that, that I don't necessarily want to call the name, that this other lady that she was working, taking care of her house, is making like over a hundred dollars a week.
Speaker 1: At Sears?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So she go and take care of the home of this other woman so that she could work at Sears?
Speaker 2: Yes, but (unclear), said these people, if they only knew my mother, they wouldn't find it easy to pay the one woman a hundred dollars a week and another one thirty-five, because my mother is a queen.  She is, she is so magisterial and so caring and so blessed of God and so used of God to be a channel to replacing other people, something must be wrong with this system.  That, that's, that probably is the most perplexing thing to deal with.  Say something is wrong with this.
Story_ID: 664435
Speaker 1: Of course, yes.  I spent the time being asked why, you know, why I can't eat at the Woolworth [F.W. Woolworth Company] lunch counter.  I lived through that.  In fact, if there is one famous story that I have, it is that all those years you walked by, you smell the food, you want anything, you're gonna buy it at the window outside 'cause you're not gonna sit down at that lunch counter.  Well I remember the day when I finally was able to eat my first meal at the Woolworth counter and why was that?  Because my brother David [David Forbes] was the president of the student body at Shaw University [Raleigh, North Carolina], he had led the sit-in movement.  It happens also that David was there when the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee [SNCC] was born.  He worked with Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].
Speaker 2: And this was when you were still (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm now, no, I'm now grown up.  I'm now in seminary [Union Theological Seminary, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Okay, so you were visiting home.
Speaker 1: Visiting home.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I go in to the Woolworth counter, so proud (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) During the sit-in.
Speaker 1: No, after, after the ruling has come down, no more segregation.
Speaker 2: Got it. Got it.
Speaker 1: Good.  I'm going down.  All these years I've wanted to--
Speaker 2: And you're proud that your brother was part of helping to make that happen.
Speaker 1: Proud of helping to get it ready, right.  So I'm going down to buy my stuff, and I knew what I was going to get.  I was going to buy myself a hot dog with mustard, relish and ketchup, and I was gonna get a big orange.  Granddaddy's [Forbes' maternal grandfather, O.C. Clemons] name was Mr. Big Orange anyhow, get me a big orange.  But when I went into that store and sat down at that lunch counter, the white woman that was sitting next to me having just been served her food, seeing my black presence, jumped up and ran out of the store.  And I tell this as often as I get a chance, I was so humiliated.  I had worked hard, I had endured patiently, you know, and now here I am.  It was if I had landed as an alien from outer space, probably bearing germs that might kill this woman if I'm sitting next to where she is.  So honest, and I guess one of these days before it's too late, I might have a psychiatrist help hypnotize me to remind me, did I ever order my meal that day.  I really don't know.  It was a (claps) such a traumatic moment.
Story_ID: 664436
Speaker 1: I do remember that I went home and I wrote a poem.  Now here's the thing, before I tell you what the poem was, that poem didn't show up for thirty years when a member, a white woman at the Riverside Church [New York, New York] where now I'm the pastor, says, "I was going through my papers and I saw a letter you wrote me January 11, 1961."  She said, "And I thought you'd like to have it."  So she gives me the letter and this is what the poem said.  The poem I sent to her after that day, just says, "Why did she move when I sat down?  Surely she could not tell so soon that my Saturday bath had worn away, or that savage passion had pushed me for a rape.  Perhaps it was the cash she carried in her purse.  She could not risk a theft so early in the month, and who knows that on tomorrow it would fall her lot to drink her coffee from a cup my darkened hands had clutched.  So horrible was that moment, I, too, should have run away. For prejudice has the odor of a dying beast, for the rapist or racist, both fall in the savage class and the greatest theft of all is to rob one's right to be."  Now, why would I send that letter to a white woman?  It's because this woman, Pete Hampton [ph.] they called her then, Dorothy Marcus [Dorothy Hampton Marcus] her name by the time I'm her pastor at the Riverside Church. She had a program helping young people do recreation, tutoring, getting ready for school and helping them.  I said well I, I'll be darn, here's a white woman that really cares about us black folks, and she made it so clear that I said if she, if she knew what had happened to me that day, she'd feel as badly about it as I do.  So back then, I sent her, I don't even know whether I kept, kept a poem for myself.  I sent it to her because she would feel the same thing I felt when a woman jumps up and runs, my first occasion to feel the dignity of full personhood.  It turns out that that was a good thing because it robbed me any justification of putting all people in the same basket.  Unh-uh, no, there's some white folks that's gonna run away, but others are opening opportunities for us to share the journey of life together.  That was a good lesson for me to learn early on in life.  And that woman who was doing that work with us kids back in '61 [1961], thirty years later, was still active at the Riverside Church in anti-racism work.  So, again, you know, you can play around with these illusions about the separation of people on the basis of skin color, it is an inadequate labeling system.  It's what's in the heart.  It's not just the color of the skin.  But anyway I don't know how we got on that.
Speaker 2: Well that's good though, thank you (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 664437
Speaker 1: Where we're gonna go now is to college.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I know you love to talk about college (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You--oh yes.  And you went to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], also my alma mater--
Speaker 2: Yay, hilltop high.
Speaker 1: Going to Howard, at this point you were not thinking you were going to be a minister.
Speaker 2: No, pre-med.
Speaker 1: You're going as pre-med as you said because of your crush (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: Many things a crush can lead you to, huh.
Speaker 2: Many things a crush can lead you to.
Speaker 1: So you, you go to Howard, what year is it that you begin Howard?
Speaker 2: I start Howard in nineteen fifty- well '4 [1954], '5 [1955], '6 [1956], '7 [1957]--'54 [1954].  I graduated--actually I graduate in 1953 from George Washington High School [Washington Graded and High School, Raleigh, North Carolina] and then that fall, so I start in '53 [1953].
Speaker 1: In '53 [1953].  Now this is a tumultuous time in our country--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --but you're heading north.  It's still the South, but its north of where you were living. I remember when I went to Howard, even though I grew up in a black community--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --Howard was the United Nations of black people.
Speaker 2: It was, yeah.
Speaker 1: Was it like that for you.  What did you see, what was Howard University like when you came in 1956?
Speaker 2: Howard was a place where blackness was highlighted as the mark of excellence and the promise of the future.  We had leaders from all around the world, lots of Africans, and Caribbean brothers and sisters, people from all over, but you got the impression at Howard that really the greatest secret in the world is what black people will do when they finally have the opportunity to cultivate their gifts to their fullest, and that we were on the way to doing that.  That's the school I went to.
Story_ID: 664438
Speaker 1: So Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  Describe what your experience was like on campus.
Speaker 2: I had some interesting experiences, number one, I lived in Cook Hall [George W. Cook Hall] and just enjoyed the fellowship there.  I got a job waiting tables at Baldwin Hall.  Loved the bea- now, you see, you understand this.  Howard University not only had some brains, but they always said the prettiest girls went to Howard because they were hoping they were gonna snag a doctor.  You know, so they--you walked through Baldwin Hall cafeteria, boy you just thought maybe, God give me grace to be able to land one of these, right, right.  So I recall working there, but I learned something there.  In Baldwin Hall I would have some friends, we'd talk.  I'm a good talker.  You know I could talk.  So I talked and my buddies would say, "Hey man," (gesture), then they always, I had the best talk but they always walked out with the prettiest girl.  So it reminded me, you know, some things you can't talk yourself up on you know.  I learned early on about that. But anyway, I had the opportunity at Howard to wait tables in Baldwin Hall.  As the head waiter, I waited tables and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] came to Bald- to Howard University.  I served him, I was honored.  At Howard University I sang at Rankin Chapel [Andrew Rankin Memorial Chapel].  I'm gonna tell you about that later on.  I mean every Sunday morning, under Dean Warner Lawson. I mean, and singing with Dean Warner with the National Symphony Orchestra.  And then singing with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra under Dean Warner Lawson, that was--I became a frat man, I became a chaplain of the Alphas [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity] there.  At Kittrell Hall [sic.] they'd have Friday night dances.  Used to love the Friday night dances up at Kittrell Hall, enjoyed that very much.  But, the fascinating experience is that humanities was difficult for many of our brothers and sisters.  I cannot understand how I organized a study group for, just before the exam in humanities, and in Douglas Hall [Frederick Douglass Memorial Hall], there's a room at the end of Douglas Hall where I would invite people to come and we would discuss the various authors that we should have read in regards to humanities, and I led that.  It was a fascinating--no reason why I, a chemistry major, should be leading seminars in humanities to warm up, getting ready to cram for the exam, but I just, it was almost a kind of sense, you know you really are interested in ideas too.  Although, but I enjoyed (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now--
Story_ID: 664439
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned that Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] came to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]. Now, historically Howard has drawn some of the most important thinkers and speakers in the country, in fact, in the world.  He came--at what point was it that he came, what was he speaking about?
Speaker 2: Well you remember 1955 with the bus boycott [Montgomery Bus Boycott]. So that beginning with that, his role was to be promoting the movement for justice across this land, and so quickly he would be invited to come to speak at Howard University.  I mean, that would be one of the first places that he would go to as his fame began to rise across the land. So--
Speaker 1: And were you part of, did you become part of his coalition?
Speaker 2: Not at that moment, no.  I, I, at that point I was still down in the valley with the, trying to get that chemistry taken care of, but I was a waiter so that gave me a chance to--
Speaker 1: So you were in the, in his company?
Speaker 2: Yes, in his company, but let me tell you, the evidence of my impression from him was that in 1956 my mother [Mabel Clemons Forbes] took me with her to hear Dr. Martin Luther King at the Needham Broughton High School [Needham B. Broughton High School] in Raleigh, North Carolina.  And, as a result of how I responded to him, my mother knew that he was going to be an important person, especially as in 1956 that same year, and I don't know whether it was a connection, I shifted at the end of that year after having been with Dr. King.
Speaker 1: From?
Speaker 2: From med to ministry.  I got my call to ministry in 1956, the same year that I had been taken to hear Dr. King, so something was going on.  And, the evidences are suggested by the fact that when I later on left to go to seminary in 1958, my mother put two books in my suitcase, one was 'Stride Toward Freedom' ['Stride Toward Freedom: The Montgomery Story'] by Dr. King.  She knew that he had me. And she might have assumed that something happened that night that had something to do with my making a choice to go into the ministry the next year, that same year (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You did finish Howard--
Speaker 2: I finished Howard--
Speaker 1: --with your chemistry degree.
Speaker 2: --I finished my chemistry degree, I got a bachelor of science in chemistry.
Speaker 1: But even though you finished, you knew you were not going to continue that matriculation.
Speaker 2: I knew.  In fact, the only benefit I got from my chemistry degree was I taught science at Kittrell junior college the year after I graduated.  That was about all I did with that chemistry degree.  I taught science at Kittrell College in Kittrell, North Carolina, before applying to Duke University to go to divinity school [Duke Divinity School, Durham, North Carolina], and Duke University wrote me a letter back saying we do not accept colored students, nor do we plan to do so in the foreseeable future.  Don't worry, I got a chance to preach at Duke University at the Founder's Day years later, and the title of my sermon was 'Let's Forgive our Fathers' and I mentioned this experience that happened.  But then I went in 1957 for one year at Kittrell and then I left the next year to come to New York [New York] to Union Theological Seminary.
Speaker 1: And coming to--at that point, this is 1957 (unclear).
Speaker 2: No, in 1956, I accepted my call to ministry.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I had had a dramatic call to ministry in 1956 while I was still at Howard, but it was not until 1958--
Speaker 1: That you started at Union Theological Seminary (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) that I, that I started here at Union seminary, um-hm.
Story_ID: 664440
Speaker 1: Give a sense of what Union Theological Seminary [New York, New York] meant at that time.  How, how did this institution of spiritual learning, how is it regarded in the pantheon of other divinity schools?
Speaker 2: Well, I had the distinction of a father [James A. Forbes, Sr.] who used to come to the minister's conference at Union Theological Seminary every summer. And one of his distinction is that the book 'Religious Affection' [sic. 'Religious Affections'] by Jonathan Edwards was being prepared by the author, and my father had the chance to be in the class as he discussed some of the early work.  So my daddy liked Union.  He thought it was a wonderful place.  Now he's a Pentecostal preacher--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --but so precocious, you know, so he was a progressive Pentecostal, but, so the fact that he had come here, I was, he had sampled it, so this was, that made it very special.  Union was very special because Henry Pitney Van Dusen, the president, had just written an article about Pentecostalism as the third force in Christendom.  It appeared in the Life magazines, a front page article. And so when I came here out of the black Pentecostal church, I was actually quite special because I represented what he had just been writing about, and people were very interested in it.  "What is this Pentecostalism like, and tell us about that movement."  In fact, I said they were about to say, at a certain point, maybe I should be the kind of student advisor to tell people about this wonderful religious movement spreading in Latin America and also growing in the United States.  Union was a place that you felt free to bring your gifts.  You recognized, sort of as we did.  At Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], just about everybody was a valedictorian so you know you're with some smart people, but you, know you can play the game.  I came, it's fascinating in order to decide whether you had to take first introductory course of the Bible, there was always a baby bible exam.  And if you didn't pass the baby bible exam, you had to take Introduction to the Bible, or something like that.  I passed it 'cause I'm out of that tradition.  We knew our bible, so it's a distinction right, right by itself.
Speaker 1: So I want to go back to the Pentecostal point for a moment because in the South, for sure, the Pentecostal church ruled and certainly for black people. It was--
Speaker 2: It was a happening institution.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: You know.
Speaker 1: I grew up in the United Methodist church, which is the opposite. Like you didn't clap your hands, you didn't turn your head, you didn't make noise, but also I would imagine that in some religious spiritual institutions of higher learning, and possibly even at Union Theological, had he not written that article at that time, you could have been very differently received. Because there were plenty of people, black too, who were very judgmental of the Pentecostal presence.  What Pentecostal faith looked like, how, the demonstrativeness of it, and the people were very judgmental.
Speaker 2: Well, I had the feeling that at, at Union seminary, the diversity was intentional, because it was considered that diversity enriches your education by exposure to different perspectives.  If they were different, it gave you an opportunity to test out your thesis, your theological perspectives against others, so I did not feel any stigma occasioned by my Pentecostal background.  Reinhold Niebuhr one of the head theologians here, said, "You know, Jim [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. James A. Forbes, Jr.], I hope you won't do as happened to the Methodists.  At first they were on fire, then they went to theological training and they lost their fire.  They still have liturgy, many words, but they've lost their--I hope that won't happen to you."  Isn't it amazing to say--
Speaker 1: Of course.
Speaker 2: --we hope that you'll keep, you know, what you have brought.  Learn from others, but bring the richness that you have.  That's a very special occasion.  We were on the cutting edge of the movement.  We would gather students together and go down south.  I remember Roger Shinn [Roger L. Shinn], one of my professors, joined me in Wilmington, North Carolina, where I had become a pastor and we were in the sit-in movement together, even after I graduated.  So one of my professors. So, so the social justice commitment and the respect for diversity indifference, and refusing to assume that your insights will be based on what label you brought with you.  That, that, that's not very intelligent, see. So I, I enjoyed Union Theological Seminary as a, as a place of learning.
Story_ID: 664441
Speaker 1: How do you consider that it formed your, your platform as a minister?
Speaker 2: Two, two things.  Union seminary [Union Theological Seminary, New York, New York] was helpful to me because it gave me ammunition to fight a major battle that I had as a Pentecostal.  Here's the battle: in my tradition, if you, in the Pentecostal tradition, if you did not speak in tongues, it was not sure, clear, that you had the Holy Spirit.  And having the Holy Spirit was the key issue, you got have the spirit to be a preacher.  Gotta have the spirit.  If you gonna be a pastor, you got to have the spirit.  But nobody ever heard me speak in tongues and therefore, people questioned, can he be an authentic minister?  We've never heard him speak in tongues, could you really have the Holy Spirit?  In fact, when I went to my first pastorate in the tradition, a large church, (unclear) say you know, "We never heard him speak in tongues, how can help us get the blessing?"
Speaker 1: So your first church after graduating from the seminary?
Speaker 2: Not really, not really.  After graduating, after graduating from seminary, my first church was a white southern Baptist church for only a summer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Student Interracial Ministry.  Then I went south to Wilmington, North Carolina where my daddy [James A. Forbes, Sr.] pulled three little churches together to make one for his son, and they called it Holy Trinity [ph.], sounded like an Episcopal church or something like that, but--
Speaker 1: And this was where--
Speaker 2: No, and then the next one is Richmond, Virginia, the real established church.  People said, "Now the bishop may have given him this position, but does the boy have the Holy Ghost?" You understand me?
Speaker 1: And the bishop is your daddy.
Speaker 2: That was my daddy.
Speaker 1: So there're not sure whether it this is nepotism or what is going on (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nepotism, right, right, right.  But, but fundamentally throughout my, throughout my time as a developing minster in the tradition.  That was the problem.  Here at Union seminary, I continued what turned out to be a life-long personal study on what does the tradition really have to say about signs and symbols and what the Holy Spirit is about.  So, I mean, please, it's a mark of pride to say I sat through the Monday morning lectures in October of 1959 when Paul Tillich, the world renowned theologian did his third volume of his systematic theology on the Holy Spirit.  As I'm listening and I came then to call myself a Tillichian Pentecostal, because it gave me a theological framework out of which to understand that you can't put God in a box.  I don't care what your religious tradition is, God is not going fit neatly in the categories of your doctrinal formulations.  Forget it, you know.  So this, this reunion was helpful to me in that way.
Story_ID: 664442
Speaker 1: I also think Union [Union Theological Seminary, New York, New York] was helpful in opportunities that I had to broaden my exposure to other traditions and learn to appreciate other traditions.  I did my field work at Church of the Master [New York, New York] down the hill from Union seminary.  Well, actually James H. Robinson [James Herman Robinson] was the pastor of that church, even before I worked with Callender, he became, Callender was the associate under James, then he became the head.  And James H. Robinson and I went to Operations Crossroads Africa while I was here under James H. Robinson.  Then I went with Callender.  Callender was a wonderful man.  I recall that one of my first times with Callender--
Speaker 2: Dr. Eugene Callender, yeah.
Speaker 1: Dr. Eugene Callender.  I was going to Rikers Island [New York, New York] early Sunday morning for services and during, for prisoners, and I remember looking out at a sea of prisoners, inmates, and I'm called upon to read the prayer of general confession.  Can you imagine this, all these people, "Oh Lord, you know, here search me and know me, you know my down seats and my up rises, you know there's no good in us, spare thou those oh Lord who confess their faults, restore us oh God."  The prayer of confession was confessing sins and here I am with these guys.  And I wonder how are they hearing this?  (Unclear) How am I praying it?  Am I praying it for them or am I praying it for myself.  It's a very, very fascinating kind of experience to, to be a minister early Sunday morning with Eugene Callender with the Rikers Island as my members of my congregation.  But anyway-
Speaker 2: So this is while--and I--
Speaker 1: While at Union.
Speaker 2: --so while at Union I learned, it wasn't called this, but essentially your outreach you were doing internships in a way.
Speaker 1: I did, I did Panel of Americans while I was at Union.  That meant that we would go around speaking.  We had one Protestant, one Catholic, one Jew and we had a woman and, yeah, we, and one Puerto Rican.  We would go around talking what does it mean to be one community?  I'm black, I talk about my experience.  This one's Latino, this one's Jewish, and I developed relationships where I was never able again to feel that God had ever put all of God's eggs into one basket.  I don't, not even my basket, that God's grasp of our possibilities were so much more expansive than we could imagine.
Speaker 2: Now that's a radical type of thought.
Speaker 1: For a Pentecostal preacher.
Speaker 2: For a Pentecostal preacher, for a Baptist preacher, I mean for, pick one, for pretty much any denomination, I mean people pretty much dig in their heels and this is the way, it's the only way.
Speaker 1: And I'm so delighted that I learned that if you're gonna be with God, you got to be with some strange bedfellows.
Story_ID: 664443
Speaker 1: So your daddy [James A. Forbes, Sr.], who is, you know, the previous generation Pentecostal preacher--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --was quite a visionary to come here.
Speaker 2: He would come just to study.
Speaker 1: To Union Theological Seminary [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Sure, but he had been an ed- he had been in our denomination, he had started what they call the BTI, Bible Training Institute.  My father was the head of that.  My father then, they called it the United Christian College [Goldsboro, North Carolina], my father was the head of that.  There was a periodical for the denomination called the Holiness Union.  My father was the head of that.  So my father was an educator and a great preacher, but he believed in learning and he believed that if you give the Lord your whole self, why are you gonna leave your head outdoors.  You said, you said take my all.  What about your brain?  What about your mind?  That kind of thing.
Story_ID: 664444
Speaker 1: So when you gra- you graduate from Union Theological Seminary [New York, New York] when?
Speaker 2: In 1962.
Speaker 1: And that's, you, you have your short time at--how did you end up for the short time at the all-white church?
Speaker 2: Because--
Speaker 1: And this is where, in North--?
Speaker 2: In Chapel Hill, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: How did they welcome you in 1962?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a difficult time even for them.  See Student Interracial Ministry was formed largely out of the National Council of Churches. They decided that if we gonna do anything about changing the patterns, we need to put black preachers in white churches so people get used to, know what that's like.  And they would put white preachers in black churches so they get to know what that's like.  So I ended up being chosen to go to Olin T. Binkley Memorial Baptist Church [Chapel Hill, North Carolina] on the University of North Carolina's [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill] campus in Chapel Hill under Dr. Robert Seymour.  So working with Dr. Seymour, I had some interesting experiences.  Let me tell you this, first of all when the deacons and I would go down the street to The Rathskeller [Chapel Hill, North Carolina]--that's the big restaurant that all of the people like on Franklin Street in the campus at the University of North Carolina--they would refuse to serve us.  Or, if we take our youth group out, we gonna play baseball, there would be N word calling as I'm down there trying to serve as an umpire.  I would go to Memorial Hospital [North Carolina Memorial Hospital, Chapel Hill, North Carolina] to visit Mrs. Bert Adams [Diane Adams] who had just had a baby while Seymour was on this trip.  I'm the pastor in charge.  I go over, I said, "Excuse me, I'm here to visit Mrs. Bert Adams."  They said, "Well, this is the white maternity ward, obviously you're looking for the one over on the other side."  I said, "No, I'm here as the," I said, "I'm the pastor at the Olin T. Binkley church and I'm the interim minister there so."  "Okay." She can't--
Speaker 1: She didn't know what to do.
Speaker 2: What to do, so here I go to greet Mrs. Adams and the new baby and bless the white baby.  Oh my god, what is wrong with this picture from their perspective, and, of course, there were many different--
Speaker 1: Were you ever afraid?
Speaker 2: Somehow fear didn't seem to be, I mean I don't think there were ever times where I feared for my life, I just knew that these people were given an experience that was beyond what they had known, so they got a right to be apprehensive.  I don't have to join that crowd.  So, no I don't think I was afraid.
Speaker 1: Did you have a sense of being a part of the movement?
Speaker 2: Robert Seymour was a progressive southern Baptist preacher.
Speaker 1: White?
Speaker 2: White, oh yeah.  And he helped to lead Chapel Hill to a greater openness about these matters.  You know what, I'm gonna be quite frank about this.  If you grow up in the South, one of the things that you remembered is that Emmett Till was brutally murdered simply for looking at a white woman, right?  They said he whistled at her, or something like that.  So black boys were taught don't, you don't, you don't look at white women. (Unclear) so one of the most anxious times for me was I had to get used to feeling, so I go with the church to the church picnic.  Carolina Beach [North Carolina] near Wilmington, North Carolina, and the, at the beach, you know your get into your bathing gear, I was a little, I was a little uncomfortable in that, in that setting because they had put into your head that the intimacy of the bathing on the community, in the community on the bath, on the beach in bathing, in your bathing suits, that's kind of, that's kind of--I was sensitive that this was a violation of what had been taught and if Emmett Till had not happened, maybe I would not have been as apprehensive about that.
Speaker 1: And it wasn't that being the space between you.
Speaker 2: I mean we're right there--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --together.
Speaker 1: I mean in time.
Speaker 2: It was very close to the same time, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Which is why I was asking you if you were ever afraid.  I mean there are different levels of what the front lines can look like.
Speaker 2: I think, I think you, in those days you would tend to anesthetize yourself to the threat.  Somehow it worked both ways as Ellison [Ralph Ellison] in the 'Invisible Man' says they don't see me because to them I'm invisible.  We also had the capacity not to see the indignity if we don't choose to.
Story_ID: 664445
Speaker 1: So when, you said your father [James A. Forbes, Sr.] put together the three churches and then, then you went to the--
Speaker 2: The big church, St. John's Holy Church [sic. St. John's United Holy Church] in Richmond, Virginia, which was pastored by the old conservative Bishop Clements [sic. William Clements].
Speaker 1: And this is in 1965.
Speaker 2: Sixty-five [1965].  From '65 [1965] to '73 [1973], I was in Richmond, Virginia.
Speaker 1: So Richmond, Virginia, during this period, this is, this is now, the Civil Rights Movement is growing.
Speaker 2: (Nods head) Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: I mean its combusting.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And Richmond is a bigger town.  What, what--take the temperature at the times in Richmond, Virginia, when you were there.
Speaker 2: Richmond was for me always the most tantalizing place I ever went to.  It felt like justice was right around the corner, but never quite there.  It was a town that enjoyed tranquility and stability, but it's not gonna let you get but so far. So I learned at that time that, you know, here we are in Richmond.  Now I was in Richmond as a pastor from '65 [1965] through '73 [1973].  Remember the Voting Right Act [Voting Rights Act of 1965] was '64 [1964] to '65 [1965].
Story_ID: 664446
Speaker 1: We were talking about your being in Richmond, Virginia and what's going on at the time?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Sixty-five [1965], we've got the Voting Rights Act [Voting Rights Act of 1965] and people in Virginia were affected by this.  For many this was the first time they were able to vote (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure, sure.  Yeah, it's a, it's a, it was an interesting time.  For an example, during that time there was a Republican governor who proved to be a human being that was free from much of the stigma associated with his party.  His name was Governor Holton [Linwood Holton], Holton.  It just turns out that he is the father of the wife to Tim Kaine.  That's fascinating, but it was a good experience for me to say, you know, he may be Republican, but he's, he's, he is not in the same batch of, of those who are not sensitive to the need for inclusion.  That's fascinating.  But during--let me tell you, Richmond, we had series of activities trying to help the black community. So violence would break out.  They'd invite us pastors down to try to figure out how can you keep the natives from being too restless. Or I remember, they're gonna place a, a garbage dump in back of Armstrong High School [Richmond, Virginia].  We're gonna protest this stuff.  So I go down and Alan Kiepper [Alan F. Kiepper] who finally became the city manager [sic.] of Atlanta [Georgia], took us in to show us things, we all arguing about where they gonna place that garbage dump.  He took us in the city planning board, and for the first time, these big maps up on the wall, saying, "Listen, I know you all are concerned about this problem, but you really understand that the way cities function, they have long range plans about what they're gonna do."  They show a, "This is the zoning for the next twenty-five years."  This taught me all of a sudden that, that people who are dealing with social issues need to be aware of the larger context in which their struggle is taking place, or it's--I, I learned from looking at those big maps where we gonna have manufacturing section, where it's gonna be the residential section, where, where we gone have the schools, where will the highways develop, how will the community plan, what will the community renewal program be.  Folks, let's get sophisticated enough to know you don't want that smoke blowing into the classrooms where our kids are learning, that's for sure, but we really, we got to get involved.  You got to get in this process, and you got to get in it so that last minute protests does not substitute for long-range strategic planning about where we gonna go.  This was a very fascinating--
Speaker 1: And this awareness came to you in Richmond as a preacher.
Speaker 2: As a preacher.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: During this time I'm working with the campus so, in fact, the reality is that during those years I stayed in Richmond I had at least ten different jobs most of all the time.  So, I was pastor of St. John's United Holy Church [Richmond, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Which is a--
Speaker 2: Pentecostal (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Pentecostal black church.
Speaker 2: Black church, but--
Speaker 1: And how big was your congregation?
Speaker 2: Oh, maybe we had two, three hundred people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but also my wife [Bettye Franks Forbes] was there and her choir was one of the best choirs in town, yeah.  Okay.  In addition, I was the head of the Richmond black clergy.  I also started the neighborhood Legal Aid Society.  I started the Progress Association for Economic Development [ph.], one of Leon Sullivan's outposts.  I was on the United Giver's board [United Giver's Fund].  I was, during that time I was president of the Richmond Urban League [Urban League of Greater Richmond, Richmond, Virginia].  You know, I was also campus minister of Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia], and at the same time I taught at Virginia Union, the Presbyterian School of Christian Education [Union Presbyterian Seminary Richmond, Virginia], at Virginia Union.  All of that at the same time.
Story_ID: 664447
Speaker 1: And just for context, when did you get married?  How long were you married at this point?
Speaker 2: I had gotten married in 1963.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were relatively newly married when you--
Speaker 2: Newlywed.
Speaker 1: Newlyweds.  You have a congregation of two or three hundred people [at St. John's United Holy Church, Richmond, Virginia].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How, clearly you are following the calling.  How are you earning a living?
Speaker 2: Well, you, your congregation pays you.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And your wi- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Are you living in a house that's owned by the church?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.  The house, the church buys a parsonage, my wife [Bettye Franks Forbes] teaches at Kennedy High School [John F. Kennedy High School; Armstrong High School, Richmond, Virginia] there, so we, you know, we are going to learn later on that money is important, but remember our parents taught us money, are you kidding, we're God's kids.  Well you know, God will make a way for us.  We almost got too spoiled in that notion because I'll tell you, as you retire and you're on fixed income you say, the Lord needs a little help too, or at least we need to help the Lord help ourselves in other words.
Speaker 1: Just, and just for the, I ask in part too for the context what it means to be a minister, if, I mean, that's a relatively small church, and I say that because there's plenty of churches that are much smaller, but at this point, there are some churches in different pockets of the country that are larger, but in terms of what the image of what it means to be a preacher and to take care of your family, it's not something that people often think of how those two fit.
Speaker 2: You know what, my, my people said if daddy [James A. Forbes, Sr.] said, if he stopped to think about how he could put eight kids through college, it wouldn't be any way to explain it looking at paper.  How is that possible?  It's not possible, and yet we're doing it.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And similarly my ministry throughout all of the years, if you ask well, who's funding this--this is a strange thing that if I call, I wrote a sermon one time 'How God Funds the Faith Enterprise' [ph.].  Ask the old folks, they say the Lord makes a way out of no way, and a whole lot of folks know what that means.  You can't explain how much was achieved.  Those people who built colleges of taking in washing and putting those pennies together, how it's--and now we have historically black colleges and universities [HBCUs] threatening with closing, and we have many more of us who are engaged in upper and middle class income levels.  We can hardly seem to figure out they did it with nothing.  It almost makes you believe that there's probably a God, you probably.  More than probably.
Story_ID: 664448
Speaker 1: You're at St. John's [St. John's United Holy Church, Richmond, Virginia] when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] is assassinated?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What happened in Virginia, in Richmond, upon his assassination? Were there riots there too?
Speaker 2: In a sense Richmond managed to come through without the level of violence that we remember in Washington, D.C. on 14th Street.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, not in Richmond.  Somehow, I think Richmond was spared the more incendiary aspects of protests, I think.  I remember the day Dr. King was assassinated.  I was on my way to Medical College of Virginia  [Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine, Richmond, Virginia] where I was taking a chaplaincy course they called clinical pastoral education.  As I'm traveling across on Marshall Street bridge headed right to the Medical College of Virginia and the news comes, I start crying.  I fear that I may not make it safely across.  I could hardly see for the tears in my eyes, but when I turn into the parking lot, I sit there with my hands on the steering wheel and I said, "Martin you shall not have died in vain," which was my commitment to sort of make sure that what he had given his life for, I was going to be engaged in seeing it through.  It's a fascinating experience for me.  So, I recall that so very clear.  But that's, by the way, that same bridge that I was on the day he was assassinated was torn down and replaced and the new bridge is called the Martin Street, is called the Martin Luther King Jr. bridge [Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Bridge] in Richmond, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Very good, um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's a fascinating, historic flashback.
Story_ID: 664449
Speaker 1: Now during your time at this church [St. John's United Holy Church, Richmond, Virginia], there's a, an important book that's published, 'Black Theology and Black Power' by James Cone [HistoryMaker James H. Cone] who--do, do--are you aware of this at the time?
Speaker 2: Was I aware of it?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, because of that book, I was first of all fascinated when I first met Jim Cone at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] at a conference on theological education.  It was at 1970.  The book was written I think in the latter part '69 [1969] or something.
Speaker 1: Sixty-nine [1969]. Yes.
Speaker 2: Right, so I met this young guy.  He's a young dude, I mean, and I was so moved by what he said.  In addition to that, I'm a preacher and Henry Mitchell [HistoryMaker Reverend Henry Mitchell] has written a book ['Black Preaching: The Recovery of a Powerful Art' Henry H. Mitchell] on black preaching so because around about this time I am also a, a campus minister at Virginia Union [Virginia Union University, Richmond, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Miles Jones was the pastor of Providence Baptist church [Providence Park Baptist Church, Richmond, Virginia], Paul Nichols, pastor of Good Shepherd Baptist Church [Richmond, Virginia], and I, the three guys who took up the job of chaplaincy, but we also taught together, and so we, we started a course at Virginia Union on black theology or preaching in the black, preaching in black liberation.  So we started taking Jim Cone's ideas and Henry Mitchell's ideas and started training people to address the liberation agenda of the black community.  I'm still pastoring, but I'm still doing--I also decided in my church to wear a dashiki so every, once a month I put on a dashiki and use my African drum that I had brought back with me to sort of say, look, we got to be a part of the movement.
Speaker 1: So this concept of black theology as opposed to theology was taking root, you know, as the '70s [1970s] are progressing, the Black is Beautiful movement (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure. Sure, sure, sure, sure.
Speaker 1: --is growing, many are wearing dashikis, natural hair.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had a beard, you should see my beard from that period.
Speaker 1: And claiming black theology.  What does that mean?  What does it mean to you, black theology?
Speaker 2: I wrote a sermon during that time entitled 'How to be Black and a Christian Too,' because it was shocking at first, because black theology started to call into question the validity of white theology that had not addressed the condition of the black people.  Jim Cone reversed the tables and said if you don't recognize it, Jesus is black, Palestinian Jew, dark skinned.  He ain't this blue eyed Jesus that we see in these various paintings.  If your religion has not dealt with blackness, it's suspect anyway.  Number one, most of us in the South are trained to be respectful and affirming of others even if we disagree with them.  It required us to question seriously the authenticity of religion we had inherited from the white community that had ignored our black existence.  But Jim Cone took that and made that the center.  We had to figure out how to disengage from our loyalty to the religion of the masters, slave masters, and dare to believe that our own experience is the beginning of the genuineness of faith that Jesus was invested in.
Speaker 1: And this is--
Speaker 2: That's a revolutionary experience.
Speaker 1: --post Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] who was murdered for speaking up.
Speaker 2: That's correct.  And we, we knew that, it's okay, we were prepared to be arrested and we participated in sit-ins and the whole question is like Alan Busey [ph.] asked when people ask you what happened to your scars, was there nothing worth fighting for.  It began to be a mark of genuineness that you feel strongly about something, enough to risk loss of well-being and even, if necessary, the loss of your life.
Story_ID: 664450
Speaker 1: As you are forming this clearer intention, you also move. Now you keep coming further north. At this point now you're in D.C. [Washington D.C.] right?  You--
Speaker 2: Intermet Seminary [Interfaith Metropolitan Education, Inc., Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Yeah. Intermet Seminary, which (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --had only recently been founded. Can you describe this--
Speaker 2: It was largely founded after the '68 [1968] riots.
Speaker 1: Right it says '71 [1971]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, because Washington says if we're gonna manage, we're gonna learn how to live together, so John Fletcher [John Caldwell Fletcher], an Anglican priest, put together this idea of a seminary without walls, asking congregations to become the central learning places for the students and once or twice a week we'd get together for theological reflections on what was happening in the forty hours that they were working, so that we developed Protestant, Catholic and Jewish congregations, our network.  Baltimore [Maryland] was included too.  Northern Virginia, there's far- Baltimore and far south as Fairfax [Virginia].  We had fifty or sixty congregations where students could come, a student minister worked for forty hours.  He said why should you consider yourself trained and you don't even know what the problems are in the context?  You at least need to know what the questions are.  You work for forty in a congregation you know what the questions are.  But we come together for a couple of days, we can have the major biblical field, historical field, the theological field and the practical field.  These disciplines you will have greater learning because you bring questions to it, rather than just a tabula rasa.  So we develop that seminary and again it reinforced the significance of learning to be faith people together.
Speaker 1: And so that, that came, this was in 1973.  And you, you were there for two years?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I was there from '73 [1973] through '76 [1976].
Speaker 1: To '76 [1976].
Story_ID: 664451
Speaker 1: Afterwards you went back to school.  So, was it--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?  Okay. What happened next (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) After, after '76 [1976] I was called back to Union Theological Seminary [New York, New York] as full professor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, I--all during this time, '72 [1972], the summer months we were working on our doctor of ministry degree, so we mentored--
Speaker 1: So that you were doing all along the way.
Speaker 2: All along the way.
Speaker 1: Got it.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  The D.Min program we would take trips together with the faculty, the trip to Africa, the trip to Jamaica, Haiti, Sea Islands of North Carolina with the faculty with us.  We were learning in the situation and then we would go to Colgate Rochester divinity school [Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School, Rochester, New York] to do our reflective and to do our writing portions of this work.
Speaker 1: But the, the doctorate was primarily in the field book.
Speaker 2: It was field work with reflections at certain periods.  Usually most of the residences were during, during the summer months and during the rest of the year, travel.  This was funded by the Irv and Sienna Miller Foundation [ph.].  It was called Martin Luther King Jr. fellows. Twenty of the most promising pastors were chosen to refine their gifts in terms of the new emphasis on black religious experience.
Speaker 1: And so now you're brought back to Union Theological Seminary.  Is this after you've completed your doctorate of divinity?
Speaker 2: Yes, I finished the D.Min, that's D.Min. Finished the D.Min in 1975.
Speaker 1: And came to--
Speaker 2: To Union--
Speaker 1: Union.
Speaker 2: --as a professor of worship and homiletic, associate professor, of worship and homiletics.
Speaker 1: In seventy--
Speaker 2: Seventy-six [1976].
Speaker 1: --where you stayed for quite some time.
Speaker 2: I worked here for thirteen years, first as an associate, then, I mean, then I became the full professor, Brown and Sockman [Brown and Sockman Associate Professor of Preaching].  Then I became the Joe R. Engle professor [Joe R. Engle Professor of Preaching] here, so for thirteen years I was the homiletics professor.
Speaker 1: And what is homiletics?
Speaker 2: Homiletics is the art and science of sermon preparation and delivery.
Speaker 1: So interestingly, in keeping with your family tree, everybody's an educator.
Speaker 2: Educator.
Speaker 1: One way or another.
Speaker 2: And that's exactly right.  That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: So you are a preacher but you are also an educator. During the time that you are teaching at Union Theological, do you also have a church?
Speaker 2: Well, when I first started here I was a pastor in a one Sunday church, one Sunday a month church in Roxboro, North Carolina.  My father [James A. Forbes, Sr.] had been the pastor of that church, then in 1960 he moved to New York [New York] to pastor the famed New Covenant Temple [New York, New York] up on Amsterdam Avenue, and he asked me would I be willing to take that church.  So for nine years, while I'm still pastoring--
Speaker 1: Once a month.
Speaker 2: --while I'm still being a professor here, I would travel once a month back to North Carolina to the church at Roxboro.
Story_ID: 664452
Speaker 1: Now while here in--well you're at Union Theological, your wife [Bettye Franks Forbes] is also developing her creativity.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yes
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did, did, tell me about the Ebony Ecumenical Ensemble.
Speaker 2: In 1979, Union Seminary decided, in keeping with its commitment to the university, that they would alter the architecture of the James Memorial Chapel [New York, New York].  It was first a divided chancel, like Scottish Presbyterian architecture.  They said we're going to gut this whole thing, make it an empty space so that any group in this seminary that wants to have worship, we gonna have a Holtkamp organ [Holtkamp Organ Company], but then we're gonna have other equipment that whoever has worship gets a chance to set it up the way they want it set up.  They won't--we won't have pews in it.  There're be chairs, you set them up according to what the pattern and style were.  When they opened that chapel they had a service, the reopening, the celebration for the renovation of the James Memorial Chapel.  They asked my wife would she put together a group that would do music of the black religious experience.  She asked students, black faculty and friends to be a part of it, and they sang for the reopening of James Chapel in 1979.  Thirty-seven years later they have evolved into being Ebony Ecumenical Ensemble and they have kept going, but they rehearse here at Union Theological Seminary [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: From that time.
Speaker 2: From--that's the beginning of the Ebony Ecumenical Ensemble, and it became a group that was so well appreciated that they've sung at Carnegie Hall [New York, New York], they've sung at the Damrosch shell [Guggenheim Bandshell] at Lincoln Center [Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, New York, New York].  They sung for Kizomba [Brasil Kizomba Festival], the international black arts festival twice in Brazil.  They sung in all of the concert halls in South Korea.  They sung across the states, tri-state area, so.  They do the music of the black religious experience, and that means they do anthems, they do spirituals, they do African work songs and sometimes African language songs.  They do gospel and they do some popular songs.

Speaker 1: You--tell me from--you were at Union Theological Seminary [New York, New York] for quite some time, you at one point, and this is sometime later, I believe you're still there, when did you write 'The Holy Spirit and Preaching' [James Forbes].
Speaker 2: I think I wrote that in 1985, '86 [1986] or something like that.  I was invited to do the Lyman Beecher lectures [Lyman Beecher Lectureship] at Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] and that's the lectureship that I finally transcribed to be the first book, 'The Holy Spirit and Preaching.'
Speaker 1: And this was all of the teaching, for your method, even method teaching, what exactly is included in this book?
Speaker 2: Usually the Lyman Beecher Lectures are designed to reflect your insights about homiletics.  And so it's a preaching conference.  You get a chance to crystalize your thoughts regarding what matters in the preparation and delivery of sermons.
Speaker 1: And you, you shared this in, in the lecture which is at Yale University, and that actually was 1986, and then afterwards you turned it into (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)Turned it into a book.
Speaker 1: --to a book.

Speaker 1: When does Riverside Church [New York, New York] become part of your, formally part of your life?
Speaker 2: Riverside Church becomes a part of my life (background noise) in 1962.  I graduated--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Riverside Church became a part of my life in 1962. I graduated from Union Seminary [Union Theological Seminary, New York, New York] and our graduation ceremonies were held at, at the Riverside Church so I'm a part of that--
Speaker 1: From the beginning.
Speaker 2: --from the beginning, in a sense.  Little--I had no inkling in 1962 that I would ever be a member of the staff of that church, not at all.  My more active engagement came when I was here as a homiletics professor, and can you imagine, under Dr. Coffin [William Sloane Coffin], who was my predecessor, I was invited to Riverside church at least once a year to preach as a visiting preacher.  Of course, makes sense, here's the homiletics professor across the street, they always have to have vacation space, the pastors go away, they invite--so Riverside had had me as a guest preacher for ten or eleven years.  So they knew me.  And, because my style was--well, pardon the self congratulation--refreshingly different (laughter).  It felt to them that it was so special.
Speaker 1: At Riverside Church, just to--because I had known about Riverside Church for a long time, I've lived in New York [New York] for years. I went to the Rockefeller estate a few years ago for Dr. Callender [Eugene Callender] and received a tour and learned about all of the saints and representatives of every religious tradition who were at that archway when you walked in--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Would you explain what is unique about this church.  What is the uniqueness of this church?  Why was it created in the first place?
Speaker 2: It was--Riverside church was created in response to a real crisis for Dr. Harry Emerson Fosdick, who was a preacher, he was a progressive preacher.  He was determined to fight against fundamentalisms and therefore, the Presbyterians defrocked him, at least refused to let him be their pastor and so he had served as a temporary pastor for First Presbyterian Church [New York, New York], you know, but he was called by the Rockefeller family to be the pastor of their church on Park Avenue.  And he said to them, "I don't wanna be the pastor of the richest man in America in the swankiest section of town."  So, Mr. Rockefeller, Rockefeller, Jr., said, "I'll tell you what, now your theology is as questionable as my wealth is, so both of us have something against us, right?"  He says, "If you are willing to be our pastor, we will build you a church in any section of town you want it."  Dr. Fosdick then agreed that since Columbia University [New York, New York] was developing over here, St. John Divine [Cathedral of St. John the Divine, New York, New York], if this hill over here, Upper West Side [New York, New York], now called, Morningside Heights [New York, New York], if you, if you build that church over there, then I'll be your pastor.
Speaker 1: And now this is in 1927.
Speaker 2: In 1927 they started the building of the Riverside Church in the location where it is now.  In 1930, they had their opening service.  In 1931, February of '31 [1931], they dedicated this new space built on the order of Chartres Cathedral in France [Chartres, France].  It was designed to be a church that ultimately would transcend denomination.  That was the desire of John D. Rockefeller, Jr.  What they really wished to do is to say that we're going to be doing the other line.  Now the Rockefellers were Baptist, so it started out being a Baptist church, built on the charter all the way back to Norfolk Street Baptist Church [New York, New York], then to Park Avenue Baptist Church, et cetera.  They decided what we're gonna do is open up.  So they opened up to the United Church of Christ that came some years later, but the goal was that it becomes an interracial, interdenominational and an international church where people are free to bring the richness of their tradition, even if you come from a tradition as in the Quakers that do not even believe in Baptism, you could be a part of this fellowship.  Riverside was gonna be a place where everybody could belong and belong and bring the richness of their uniqueness without having to be cookie cutter according to other denominational formulations.  That's the kind of church it was.

Speaker 1: So in 1989, you were installed as the fifth senior minister of the Riverside Church in New York City [New York, New York]. The first African American to hold this very prestigious role.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And I was reading about that moment and you, you described that preachers came from all over the country.  Can you describe the installation?
Speaker 2: It's amazing how an event is not primarily about the participants who are there.  It's about the movement that they are a part of.  For me, having preached all across the United States for many, many years, probably more than many other pastors, I, because of my ecumenical outlook, have preached at more diverse settings, have more connections with more denominations and communions so that my being there as the senior minister is like opening the door for their full inclusion in the lore we- related to the Riverside Church (background noise).  So it's amazing that how many, say over three hundred, over three hundred  pastors from across the nation come to celebrate that at long last religious America has witnessed the breaking of the glass ceiling and a black man that we know is now the head of this church.  I didn't know that many people had that much investment in the symbolism of that moment, but it was the case.
Story_ID: 664456
Speaker 1: And that moment, which is in 1989, so now just, what's going on in the world just one year later is one of the most historic moments in the world when Nelson Mandela, who had been imprisoned for twenty-seven years, no one ever imagined, well many wished and worked for his emancipation, but I don't know how well people thought it was really gonna happen, and then he was freed.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And where did he come?
Speaker 2: Can you believe that out of all of the venues that he could have chosen, that Nelson Mandela chose the Riverside Church [New York, New York] as the place for his first major presentation upon his release from prison.  So he comes and people ask me all the time, what is the most powerful moment that you've experienced in ministry?  Well, listen, that day when Nelson Mandela came walking down the aisle of the Riverside Church and I'm with him and Baba Olatunji [Babatunde Olatunji] is playing the drum and the people are doing the toyi-toyi and finally we are at the platform, and then the Reverend Dr. Gardner Taylor [HistoryMaker Reverend Gardner Taylor] says, "And now I present to you the moral leader of the world," and everybody breaks out in thunderous applause and dancing.  I think it went on for ten minutes before we could settle down and have the first (unclear).  That was the high point.  It was high because he was free.  It was high because South Africa was free.  It was high because we had the opportunity to attach ourselves to the emergence of a new quality of life amongst all people.  And so it was an electric moment, a little, little bit of heaven as I say.
Story_ID: 664457
Speaker 1: As you are leading Riv- the Riverside Church [New York, New York] which is certainly an integrated church, integrated in many ways, you know, from race, from gender and walks of life.  I mean it's a huge sanctuary, many people are there, you also continue to advocate for social issues and the church becomes an even bigger platform for such an advocacy.  What are some highlights of--?
Speaker 2: Well, you know Riverside has been in the forefront of social causes through the years.  Even if you wanna go back to our founder, Fosdick [Harry Emerson Fosdick], he was the one who stood up for progressive understandings, for faith taking science seriously, for getting beyond war as a primary means of solving, of resolving problems, so, he, he, he's been on the forefront too.  McCracken [Robert McCracken] stood tall and sustained that.  He helped to broaden the inclusion of people of color during his time, and Campbell [Ernest T. Campbell] was a guy who happened to be the pastor during the time when Jim Foreman [HistoryMaker James Forman] presented the Black Manifesto, interrupting the services of Riverside Church, but the Riverside Church got behind this movement and helped to promote other development of funds to try to do something about addressing the inequities in our time.  And Coffin, Bill Coffin [William Sloane Coffin] was Mr. Peace, prophet in this time.  I mean he was so instrumental in making things happen, including Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] talk with clergy and laity concern taking place under his leadership there in 1967.  So Riverside was always that way.  But I think that my coming to Riverside provided, let me say, these people been talking it, but it looked like they really mean it.  And I think that the black community really felt that they were at home in that place and that Riverside was not a white church, but it was a church for the community, and that we had equal stakes in it and that we had shared sense of welcome there.  I think maybe that was an important issue.  Of course, the other major issue during my time was the follow through on an effort started during Coffin's time that talks about inclusion of gay and lesbian brothers and sisters no longer being excluded.  Coffin had worked hard, but it was during my time that we had to live through this or started having the occasions of doing bondings together, revolutionary, really--
Speaker 1: So around what time was that?
Speaker 2: Oh, '85 [1985] is when they made the inclusiveness statement, but it took a decade beyond that to really normalize the inclusion of people beyond the consideration of their sexual orientation.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 664458
Speaker 1: And how did the congregation [at Riverside Church, New York, New York] accept this?
Speaker 2: Well, I would say the greatest issue of acceptance it seems to me was to accept the authenticity of my being who I was even if it wasn't what they had been used to.  I mean, so, it was a glorious occasion for me to be inaugurated in that place, but a couple of months later, people woke up, "Oh my god, he really is black, and he is different."
Speaker 1: And so did you have challenges as a result of that?
Speaker 2: Are you kidding me?  I mean it became so clear to me that in a moment of strength or weakness, people were glad that they had lived into the liberalism that they were known for, but how do you adjust to the rearrangement of the social and cultural patterns that make what's been excluded now the center, or to say it another way, they loved me every year I came.  I was wonderful dessert, but what happens when dessert becomes the main course.  That's a problem.  I mean I was a real challenge for these people and some of them let me know that in no uncertain terms.  I mean I remember one night, which was the most painful night in ministry in my life, where less than a year, there was a group got together and decided that they had had enough of Jim Forbes [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. James A. Forbes, Jr.].  They called this meeting together and everybody knew that this was going to be a kangaroo court and that that was going to be the end of a nice little experiment in democratic leadership.  At that meeting that night, it was intense that I'm sitting there and I actually really, if you can believe it, if I had had a button that I could push where I could take myself out of that situation, I would have done so.  But let me tell you what happened.  Earlier that day I had gone to Calvary ba- Calvary Hospital [Bronx, New York] where, visiting an old lady and when I got there I asked her daughter to ask your mother what would she like me to read.  Her mother said, "Psalm 27."  So I read Psalm 27.  "The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?  When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell," all (unclear). Well when I got out of her room, the spirit said, "You got a big meeting tonight, and I needed to remind you that that's the text I gave you the night you accepted the call to ministry at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  And the reason I told you that night to learn it by heart, you said 'I don't know it,' but I made you quote it," and I thought that because I was given the ability to learn it so quickly that it meant that I was gonna be blessed with phenomenal memory, and so the Lord said, "That wasn't it at all.  There are situations where you're gonna need these words where you can't afford to stoop down or look down or turn around, but it's in there now, so you be aware."  That night when things got so hot, the words came to my mind, it is for this reason that you learned that Psalm, now recite it.  So, I'm sitting there, "(unclear) on the speaker, the previous vote," da da da da, oh, they was, it was just awful.  I sat there and people who were my friends who were there says all of a sudden my countenance changed, instead of fear, they noticed that a sort of gentle assurance came across my face because what I was doing is inside myself I was quoting, "The Lord is my light and my salvation, who shall I fear.  The lord is the strength of my life, (mumbling), wait on the Lord and be of good courage, he shall strengthen."  That in the quoting of that God given passage in 1956, here it is 1990, yeah maybe 1990, that gave me strength.  They said when my countenance changed, the tenor of the meeting changed.  All of a sudden it got sane in there.  In fact, at the end of the meeting, that next week I received a letter from a woman whose name was Elaine, her name Elise Higgenbottom [sic.].  She said, "I came to this meeting because I heard they were getting ready to try to oust you."  She said, "But I listened to what you said about how your ministry was gonna go and I liked very much what you said.  I want to support your ministry.  Please find enclosed a check for fifty thousand dollars just to help you get this program moving that you talked about."  Her name was not, her name was Elise Goldman.  I went to her funeral a few years ago when I was preaching at Duke University [Durham, North Carolina] I heard she had died.  I just went by to say, "You all don't know the encouragement from your mother helped saved a preacher's life."  Again, don't count people out.  She's a white woman. But again--
Speaker 1: And you served as senior pastor for how many years?
Speaker 2: Eighteen years.  They thought I, they thought I was gonna be gone in one, in one year and a half, for eighteen years.
Story_ID: 664459
Speaker 1: And over that period, because the Riverside Church is so prominent in New York City [New York, New York], that wasn't the only bumpy time.  I mean there were times when that, and it would be public, that we don't know what's gonna happen to Reverend Forbes [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. James A. Forbes, Jr.].
Speaker 2: Well, my, somebody who worked out of The New York Times, said they had a folder this thick on Dr. Forbes, say because everything that go on, Dr. Forbes didn't want to make any comments about this, but he's implicated in this.  If, if you didn't know, you'd have thought I was the worse guy in the world listening to some of the articles, but somehow I was able to weather the storm and didn't seem to get anything that was substantial enough to render me inadequate for the role, and by the time I left, a fascinating indication is after I left they had an interim, a first minister, they had an interim minister who stayed there a couple of years.  Then they got a minister the third year.  Then they ran him out and then they got another interim minister who stay about three or four years, so--
Speaker 1: And then they invited you back (laughter).
Speaker 2: And then they invited me back.  So I would say, a little vindication there that he might not be, it's kind of like a tee shirt that Ardith Hayes, one of the professors at Union [Union Theological Seminary, New York, New York] used to wear.  She says I may not be perfect, but parts of me are excellent.  You know what I mean? I may not be perfect, but parts of me are excellent.
Story_ID: 664460
Speaker 1: Now while you were there, you founded the Healing of the Nations Foundation.  What was that?
Speaker 2: It was only--well, what I really founded while I was there is Space for Grace.
Speaker 1: Yes, okay.
Speaker 2: It was when I left that I founded Healing of the Nations.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what is Space for Grace?
Speaker 2: Lord have mercy, what is Space for Grace?  Now remember, I'm Pentecostal, but I'm ecumenical, so listen, I've learned to fit into any kind of situation, but the truth of the matter is, in my spirit there's a lot of that energy from southern free church religion that get not get full expression in the pulpit on Sunday morning at Riverside [Riverside Church, New York, New York].  So I figured okay, I'll tell you what, I'm not gonna bother the service much up here, keep it pretty much so that they can feel at home who have been the champions of this particular approach to religion, but on Wednesday night, you know black churches always did have prayer service, right?  There was no regular prayer service at Riverside, so we decided to create a special service.  Now upstairs in the main (unclear), you had to do it right because God attended that service.  So we said we gonna have a service where the Lord may not have to show up to check and see if it's okay, right?  We put together a service that's based on everybody comes, we're gonna have soup and sandwich.  When we get there, we're gonna open up with people reporting in on what's happened to them during the week, what their joys were, what their petitions are.  We're gonna have a chance for me to preach.  Instead of having notes, I'm just walk around and talk to the people about what we've been through and what's going on, and after the service we can have prayer for people.  Sometimes we're gonna have music.  Music is gonna be based on a choir that Bettye [Bettye Franks Forbes], my wife, put together.  They come around the piano, and sing the songs, and then the choir, people start to participate.  Then people respond to what is going on in the service, and at the end of the service, I offer a prayer, then we join hands and we sing, (singing) "I feel like going on, I feel like going on.  Though trials come on every hand, I feel like going on" ['I Feel Like Going On'].  And people said that the intimacy, freedom to express both joy and sorrow, they said, "I got freer, I wasn't worried about protocols, I'm just talking to the folks y'all, this is what the Lord said."  Space for Grace became part of what made it possible for me to honor the other, but to be myself, and they say that the freedom by our choir in the basement in Space for Grace manifested itself upstairs and it began to relax.  So people figured out we don't have to do that and some folks never came to Space for Grace 'cause that wasn't their thing, and they didn't have to.  It was my thing.  It was the thing for a whole lot of other people.  It became a model, but you know what, if you got to live together and the tastes are different, you get yourself two TVs, not everybody have to watch the same TV at the same time, the same program.  It's, it's kind of model of, you know, homogenization doesn't solve all the problems, but having a space in the context where everybody can feel that this is the way I would organize it if I were in charge. And in Space for Grace the people were in charge.  We enjoyed that.
Story_ID: 664461
Speaker 1: But after I got out of, of Riverside [Riverside Church, New York, New York], I needed something to do to move from retail business to wholesale business, and because--remember now, I went to med school.  I didn't get to med school, I went to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] undergrad because I wanted to be a doctor. So when I got through with my Riverside experience, the Lord said, "Now you said you want to be a healer, I told you you could be a healer of a different sort, so here's what I want you to realize.  Is that in the Book of Revelation, it says that the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations, and I want you to go across this nation telling people that each person is a leaf from the tree of life and this requires that they be conscious about, they be conscientious about their own health and that they become channels of blessings to others and therefore you're gonna develop this organization called Healing of the Nations Foundation, trying to get everybody to be a leaf, be conscientious about your own health, but be open to be a channel of grace to others."  So that's where the healing--
Speaker 2: And how long--this, you started this in 2007 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Two thousand--after--
Speaker 2: --after leaving Riverside the same year--
Speaker 1: The same year, the same year I left Riverside. Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And how, is it ongoing or how did you--
Speaker 1: It is going on.  I had an interruption in the focus because a fellow that started the Drum Major Institute [New York, New York] said, "You know what, given what you do, we could hook you up with Martin Luther King III, and we'd make a dynamite thing," and we used the Drum Major since it was founded by Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and Harry Wachtel [Harry H. Wachtel] that, so for a few years, we worked under the hope that Martin and I would traverse this nation promoting the continued issue (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Martin Luther III.
Speaker 1: Martin Luther III could, could traverse this nation making those issues.  That went for a while, but at the present time my primary emphasis was on, you talk about healing, Lord knows we need some healing in this nation.
Speaker 2: So tell me what the Drum Major, what is that?
Speaker 1: Drum Major Institute.  When Dr. King had the southern leadership Christian conference [Southern Christian Leadership Conference], as you will recall, part of the effort was to raise money to bail people out after they had participated in his protest.  They also got together to talk about the principles that informed the movement, to cultivate agencies that would support both on a secular perspective as well as from a faith perspective.  Now that was much more a southern thing.  Up north, a man named Harry Wachtel gathered Dr. King and they got together and formed the Drum Major Institute which was designed to raise money to provide legal counsel to do strategic planning and to work with Dr. King in his work.  So that lasted and it served the northern end of the movement in a powerful way.  Upon Harry's death and Dr. King's death obviously, there was a decline in that.  Then [HistoryMaker] Andrew Young was asked to help get it started and working with Martin III. The son of Harry Wachtel, Bill Wachtel [William B. Wachtel], was interested in doing now what his father had done then.  He put together the resources, got together a board, and they started using Drum Major Institute to continue the unfinished work of Dr. King.  It had to do with education, legislation, training and resource development.
Speaker 2: For people coming out of--
Speaker 1: So, so college students could come and become Drum Major fellows, there would be campaigns, there would be consultations, there would be research on what legislation was taking place and whether it was tending towards the values that Dr. King talked about.  So it was a general--
Speaker 2: And this is ongoing, you continue to work with (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It continues now, it continues.  The leadership is under Martin Luther King down in Atlanta [Georgia] where he is and he's helping to carry it on.
Speaker 2: And in these times when there remain such a huge percentage of African Americans who are incarcerated for whatever reason, this organization really more to help, is that correct?
Speaker 1: Yes, Johnny Mack has become the executive director working along with Martin Luther King III and doing all they can simply to have a voice that reminds us of the three triplets that Dr. King talked about, racism, militarism and materialism, or bigotry, poverty and violence, and, and people seem to forget that Dr. King's emphasis was also on nonviolent approaches to conflict resolution.  They continue to do that work.  I serve as their national minister because my work is primarily spiritual--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --but spiritual that has societal transformation as the focus of the energy.
Story_ID: 664462
Speaker 1: In your, in quotes, retirement from Riverside, the Riverside Church [New York, New York], you have continued to educate. And, and you wrote another book in 2009, whose go- 'Whose Gospel?: A Concise Guide to Progressive Protestantism' [James A. Forbes, Jr.].  What's the thesis of that book?
Speaker 2: The reality is that we are divided as a family of faith by differences on some very key issues and each one claims that this is the gospel.  I wrote that book to say that from a progressive point of view, there needs to be a discussion across ideological lines on the following issues.  Number one, sexuality.  As you will remember, it was a fierce thing, same sex issue.  I wrote a book on sexuality, a chapter on sexuality, what would a progressive think about in dealing with the issue of sexuality?  Race.  Notice, people that are segregationist have a gospel.  They believe it strongly.  If you believe in the gospel of human race inclusiveness, there is one gospel.  If you believe in the legitimacy of segregating, that's another gospel.  What about gender?  What is the issue of the relationship between men and women in the eyes and women in the eyes of God, and what impact should that have as we order our society?  It's a fascinating thing that one of the issues in the present election is do you wanna--
Speaker 1: Present meaning between Hillary Clinton [Hillary Rodham Clinton] and Donald Trump [President Donald John Trump]?
Speaker 2: Between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.  There's some folks whose only major reason is she's a woman.  I mean there are still folks that say, you know, "I don't like Trump so much but he is at least a man."  There are folks for whom there are fundamental aversion to Mrs. Clinton is she's just a woman, or if she's a tough woman, well that ain't very womanish.  What about climate.  I mean we got college-trained folks sitting around talking about whether there's anything at all to the crisis in regards to climate change.  My book was designed to talk about war.  Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] said that war is gonna end up with all of us being both toothless and blind at the same time.  There's a, how do you look at the issue, so we, so environment, gender, race, sexuality, gender, these things need to be discussed, which gospel do you really believe in?  Whose gospel are you in, and my book was designed to help people look at it, usually from a perspective of somebody who was evangelical, Pentecostal from its foundation, but who in pursuing the truth as he experienced it came to a more progressive outlook.  At least I respect even those who are still there.  But let me tell you what my trajectory was, that's what the book is all about.
Story_ID: 664463
Speaker 1: You are eighty-one years young, correct?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What do you feel your role is today as you look to the years that you have left on this planet--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --as, as a preacher and one holding the baton?
Speaker 2: Well, my concern was what would I answer that question in years to come. So in 1984, while I was attending a ministry conference where I was lecturing for the Church of the Covenant [ph.], I was cold in Minneapolis, Minnesota, that January day.  I got up beside my bed waiting for them to come pick me up and I said Lord I am running my fool self to death.  If you don't make it clear to me what I'm supposed to be doing, I'll just run out of steam before I even define what I'm about.  I had a religious experience.  So I'm down beside side of the bed and all of a sudden I'm told, "I hear your prayer and I'm answering your prayer in the form of a cadence of your clap."  Wow, that's weird.  Us Pentecostals speak in tongue but I'm being given a clap, so he said, "Listen to what they clap, the cadence" (claps), so I listened and listened and I said, "Yes sir, but you know I have to have an interpretation," and the interpretation came back the spiritual renewal of the nation is the task to which I have called you.  Since 1984, everything I do, up my sleeve is the question.  In what way will this action, this advocacy, in what way will this consultation, in what way will this preaching project contribute to the (claps) spiritual renewal of the nation.  So then that's the answer.  It's 2016, it's the same thing.  I chose to come to Riverside [Riverside Church, New York, New York] after I had already received a contract from Princeton University [Princeton, New Jersey] to become the university chaplain, and this wonderful contract with President Shapiro [Harold T. Shapiro] at Princeton, but when Riverside opened up and they asked me to come, the reason I chose Riverside is I thought maybe there's a better prospect that I may be able to serve the (claps) spiritual renewal of the nation by coming to Riverside.  And when I retired from Riverside, the reason wasn't, I finally won most of the battles.  Not everybody liked me.  Some folks was so glad when I left, but Ii figured, you know, it's time to leave, there's another aspect of the work that I need to do if I am going to do the (claps) spiritual renewal of the nation.  So that's my answer to you.
Speaker 1: That's a great answer (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's what it's been ever since 1984.
Story_ID: 664464
Speaker 1: I already asked you what your work is.  As you think about your legacy, what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I would like for my legacy to be that Jim Forbes [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. James A. Forbes, Jr.] in the eighty-one years he's lived, and if I could change the year, as how long I live, consistently sought to be the servant of God and a mouthpiece for the will of God as best as he could discern it and to effectively challenge his nation to pay attention to the will of God for therein is our best prospect for the future.  That's all.  That does it.  Over all these years, he consistently sought to speak God's word to a nation that is sometimes oblivious of the fact that God is our creator and God is our director and God is our guide.  And our future would be much better if we take time to consult with God every now and then about the choices that we're going to make.

Speaker 1: What would you share with young people--(cough) pardon me--young people who are, who have received the calling and are beginning their service for the ministry.  What advice do you have for them?
Speaker 2: You know, there's a passage of scripture that said, "Faithful is the one who calls us who also will do it" [1 Thessalonians 5:24].  Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] said that in the work of justice, we should be reminded that we have cosmic companionship.  Anybody whose called to ministry today, I would say to them, make sure that you are absolutely confident that the Lord who called you is actually actively engaged in paving the way for you, providing for you, guiding and directing you.  And if you are confident in that, then spend time remaining as alert as you can to the voice of God inside of you and to act courageously in confidence that with your partner you can handle whatever you're called upon to do.

Speaker 1: As you look back at your life thus far, do you have any regrets?
Speaker 2: Do I have any regrets?  It's hard to answer that question, like early on you asked me what was my favorite phrase or something, and I said, "All things work together for good to those who love God and who are called according to God's purposes."  So the first answer to give you is whatever happens to me, whatever mistakes I make, whatever foibles are revealed about me, the first impulse that I have is Lord what are you gonna get out of that.  Now, if that's the case, I am confident that there are roads that I would have chosen that might have looked better or that there were demands that I would have made that might have been more fruitful, but I'm so busy watching for the unfolding of the divine grace in the midst of even disgrace that I don't have too much time for regret.  But there are some regrets.  One regret is that I think that I and the Lord are debating this, God has been so good to me that actually I have been spoiled by God, and I will be debating this with God. God I trusted you so much, were there times in which you would have preferred me to be more proactive in caring for myself, my health, my family, my resources, my reputation, my PR [public relations]?  And the debate we had is the Lord says, "Listen Jim [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. James A. Forbes, Jr.], it is true that I told you that I would provide for you, but that does not mean that I was going to go the grocery store and shop for you, and then bring it home and cook for you, and then chew it for you and then digest it for you, and then discard the part that's not healthy.  I didn't say that."  And I think as I now enter the second eighty-one years of my life, I'm thinking it's not too late to teach the dog, old dog new tricks, and that is I guess I wish that at more points, I had been active in partnering with God to care for myself and those I care for rather than be so completely trusting.  But after all, it's a pardonable offense.  God has just taken such good care of me that I have been indulged in this almost absolute confidential trust.  "I've got some gifts in you that need cultivating too.  Do not let me spoil you into irresponsibility in the name of trusting me.  Do your part and I got your back."

Speaker 1: Now at this point, 2016, you and your bride, Bettye [Bettye Franks Forbes] have been married how long?
Speaker 2: Fifty-two years.
Speaker 1: And how many children do you have?
Speaker 2: We have one son--
Speaker 1: And he is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and two grandkids.
Speaker 1: What's his name?
Speaker 2: His name is James III [James A. Forbes III], and the son is James IV [James A. Forbes IV].  He has to have that name, he's gonna be a king.
Speaker 1: Is there anything you would like to share with others in this document of your history for The HistoryMakers I have not asked you?
Speaker 2: It is important for us finally to figure out what matters.  No matter who you are, you really have not fully lived until you come to know the why and the what for of your life.  There may be different approaches to finding it out, but the answer you come up with, please consult with the one who made you, who built into you why and who is awaiting with the expectation for your fulfillment of the what for, which is to say folks I doubt very seriously that anybody will find the fullness that's appropriate to their lives apart from some very serious conversation with God.
Speaker 1: (Pause) Thank you.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.

Speaker 1: This first picture is taken in 1956.  It happens to be the year I was called to ministry.  I was the [U.S.] Air Force ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] cadet and I'm at the summer training at Eglin Air Force Base and I'm getting a chance to do my first trial flight with my T-33 trainer [Lockheed T-33].
Speaker 2: And where is Eglin?
Speaker 1: Eglin Air Force Base is in Florida.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Did you stay in the ROTC?
Speaker 2: No, I did just a ninety-day wonder and then out of summer training.
Speaker 1: This is the picture on the program when I became the pastor at St. John's Holy Church [sic. St. John's United Holy Church] in Richmond, Virginia.  This is my first major appointment.
Speaker 2: And this is in what year?
Speaker 1: In Richmond, Virginia, and that was in 1965.
Speaker 2: Actually this was probably before that, we probably put it out of order.
Speaker 1: Out of order.
Speaker 2: But it's okay.
Speaker 1: This is the picture of my first appointment by my father [James A. Forbes, Sr.] to a church in Wilmington, North Carolina.  He gathered three smaller Pentecostal churches and named it Holy Trinity Church [ph.] and we bought the former St. Andrews Presbyterian church [St. Andrews-Covenant Presbyterian Church, Wilmington, North Carolina] as the first location, so this is--
Speaker 2: What year?
Speaker 1: This was in 1962.
Speaker 2: And I think this must be a--
Speaker 1: Anniversary, right?
Speaker 2: This must be an anniversary.  Does it have anything on the back of it?
Speaker 1: Let's see.  June wedding anniversary surprise.  I do not see a year, a senior chair, after senior chair concert.  Do you have a sense of when it was? Okay.
Speaker 2: Let's just say this is a surprise wedding anniversary sponsored by I think members of St. John's Holy Church.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Did you name your wife.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, this is Bettye [Bettye Franks Forbes] and me.
Speaker 1: How does Bettye spell her name?
Speaker 2: Bettye spells her name B-E-T-T-Y-E.  This must have been at St. John's because that was there when the Black Power movement encouraged me to wear my beard.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: That's me with my son, James III [James A. Forbes III].  And I guess, at that point, that brother was about, oh, five years old, so that would have been in '77 [1977].
Speaker 1: Oh this is a family reunion that took place, I believe--no, it's an occ- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Let's see what it says.
Speaker 1: I think I know what it is.
Speaker 2: Okay, you can tell us.
Speaker 1: I think this is an occasion in Raleigh, North Carolina, where my brother David [David Forbes] is being honored as the citizen of the year in Raleigh, North Carolina, a memorial held at the city center.
Speaker 2: Bettye and I are posing outside of the back of the Riverside Church [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: About what time?
Speaker 2: Oh, we can say around about 2014.
Speaker 1: When you came back.
Speaker 2: Maybe when I--what does it say?
Speaker 1: But it was 2014 when you came back.
Speaker 2: Oh, this is in Australia where I had the opportunity to be with at the original people of South--of Australia and we were at a protest ceremony where they were protesting against Australians adopting Aborigine babies.
Speaker 1: And do you know when this was?
Speaker 2: I know that it is Friday, the thirteenth because it's the day before I came back.  What year does it say?  I'm having trouble remembering exactly when that was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This says 1960.
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty [1960] when I participated in Operations Crossroads Africa.  We held our ceremonies in Togo, in Togoland, and this is (unclear), a gathering of Operations Crossroads people.
Speaker 1: And where are you?
Speaker 2: I am sitting.  It looks like me right there.

Speaker 1: This is like in 1997, probably after the passing, the commencement.  Cornel West and I were good friends here at the seminary [Union Theological Seminary, New York, New York] and I think maybe this happens to be after we attended a ceremony honoring Jim Washington [James Washington], our, one of our favorite professors.
Speaker 2: This is Bob Seaver [Robert E. Seaver] and myself.  We taught speech together here at the seminary for many years.
Speaker 1: And this is in what?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's around about '76 [1976], let's say that looks about '80 [1980].
Speaker 1: I served as chair of the board at, chair of the board at Manhattanville College [Purchase, New York] and the year we offered an honorary degree to Hillary Clinton [Hillary Rodham Clinton].
Speaker 2: Do you know what year that was?
Speaker 1: See what it says.
Speaker 2: Two thousand four [2004].
Speaker 1: Okay, and the president was Richard Berman.
Speaker 2: Is he in the picture?
Speaker 1: Yes, he's still living.  That's Richard Burman.
Speaker 2: I taught a course in 1997 at Harvard Divinity School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] and I invited my siblings up to help me teach the course.  So there I am, Anna [Anna Forbes Towns] the lawyer, David the preacher, Ronnie the psychiatrist.
Speaker 1: In order going this way.
Speaker 2: Okay.  James Forbes [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. James A. Forbes, Jr.], second is Anna Towns the lawyer, David Forbes the preacher and Dr. Ronald Forbes.  David is doctor too.
Speaker 1: During the time I was at Harvard Divinity School, I had the privilege of meeting with Leon Higginbotham [A. Leon Higginbotham, Jr.], the third circuit court judge, along with Bettye [Bettye Franks Forbes], my wife, and myself, in his home.
Speaker 2: This was 1997.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: This is 2004.
Speaker 1: In 2004, I received the Cronkite award [Walter Cronkite Faith and Freedom Award] presented by the Interfaith Alliance and Welton Gaddy [C. Welton Gaddy] is in the center.  That Jim Forbes first, Welton Gaddy and Walter Cronkite.
Speaker 2: Here are from two different times.
Speaker 1: Well, I guess, those both probably took place while I was in Richmond, Virginia, in one or the other jobs that I had while I was there. I still have
Speaker 2: And let's see here, let's see. Our time is (unclear).
Speaker 1: That's at Riverside Church [New York, New York] in a moment of intense admonition (laughter).
Speaker 2: And you were at Riverside Church what years?
Speaker 1: I was there from 1989 to 2007.
Speaker 2: That great day when Nelson Mandela made his first trip, was it in '90 [1990]?  See if there's a date on the back.
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety [1990].
Speaker 2: Um-hm, 1990, and Winnie Mandela was with him too.
Speaker 1: Again, this is when Nelson Mandela made his second visit and his final visit to the Riverside Church.  Magubane [Mathula Magubane] was the chief consulate, and Graca [Graca Machel] is the wife of Nelson Mandela, Nelson Mandela then myself.
Speaker 2: The Dali Lama visited the Riverside Church several times during my ministry there and he presented me the stole that you see on my hands which is quite an honor.
Speaker 1: And do you have a sense of when this was?
Speaker 2: Two thou- no it was 2012 maybe.
Speaker 1: And then.
Speaker 2: Those two books, the first 'The Holy Spirit and Preaching,' [James Forbes] the Lyman Beecher lectures [Lyman Beecher Lectureship] given at Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] in 1986, and 'Whose Gospel?,' ['Whose Gospel?: A Concise Guide to Progressive Protestantism,' James A. Forbes, Jr.] written and actually published in 2010, two of the volumes I tend to describe what matters to me in faith.
