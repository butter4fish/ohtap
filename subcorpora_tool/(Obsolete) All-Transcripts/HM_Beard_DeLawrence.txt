Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I am the interviewer today for the HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Sterns.  Sir, could you please state your name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Yes.  DeLawrence Beard.  That's Capital D, small e, capital L, no space, A-W-R-E-N-C-E, last name Beard, B-E-A-R-D, and no middle initial.
Speaker 1: Is there a--do you know where DeLawrence comes from?  In terms of--that's an unusual first name.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I asked my parents about that and there was a family friend whose name was Lawrence and my father's first name is Derex D-E-R-E-X so, they put them together and my name is DeLawrence.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's where it came from.
Speaker 1: Alright.  Now what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: December 26, 1937 and I was born in Okolona, Arkansas, O-K-A-L-O-N-A [sic, O-K-O-L-O-N-A], Arkansas.
Speaker 1: And, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm a Circuit Court Judge.  Chief Judge of the Sixth Judicial Circuit of Maryland and the, the county seat is in Montgomery County, Rockville [Maryland].  That's where I work.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: April the 26, 19--2003 (laughter).
Speaker 1: Alright, and where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: Right now, we're in Rockville.  In my chambers in the Judicial Center, 50 Maryland Avenue, Rockville, Maryland.

Speaker 1: Okay, now before we go into depth, there are five "People Magazine"-ish type questions--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: I am compelled to ask you.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: They just require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: The first was is, Sir, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: I don't have a favorite food, but I like all spicy food.  No matter what, what origin or structure, so, I don't have a favorite food.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I tend to like brown.  Yes. Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: The fall.  Mid-fall.  When the temperature's consistently around fifty degrees.  Why that is, I don't know but, it--the temperature seems to be more--it initiates one to move, to act as opposed to the summer when you wanna slow down and rest most of the time.  I like- it's invigorating.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  The wind.  The briskness.  The cool early morning.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: My wife [HM Lillian M. Beard] and I have, over the last 10 or 12 years, revisited Mexico.  A place on the Pacific Coast called Mazatlan, Mexico.  We love it.  We've been going down there every year for the last, probably ten years.  Maybe we have missed a year, but we consistently go.  And, it's very relaxing, very pleasant.  The food is great.  The weather is great.  The scenery is terrific and it's a place of total relaxation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: None that I can think of.  You mean one that I use in the courthouse (laughter) or outside the courthouse?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, some people have a favorite quote or they have something they say all the time.
Speaker 2: You know, I think other people who are in my company a lot would probably be able to answer that better, better than I can.  I don't, I can't think of anything that I use with great frequency that would be called a phrase or expression.
Story_ID: 85941
Speaker 1: Alright. Now, I'd like to ask you about your family history.  Tell me, how far back can you trace your family?
Speaker 2: Actually, I can't trace it back that far.  I think Alex Haley's book "Roots" had a lot to do with people developing an interest, at least a casual interest in their history.  But, I don't have any recollection of any of my grandparents.  Three of them died, two of them died before I was born.  But, I do have a very, very faint recollection of my paternal grandfather.  And, his name was Lawson Beard.  But, the--my maternal grandfather was alive when I was born, but he lives in Chicago [Illinois], so I never saw him.  And, both my grandmother's passed away before I was born.
Speaker 1: Now, are your relatives mostly from Okolona [Arkansas]?
Speaker 2: Everyone my age or older in my family was born in Okolona, Arkansas.  My mother was born there.  My father was born there.  Virtually, all of my aunts and uncles were born there.  But, all my siblings were born in St. Louis, Missouri, which is where I grew up.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 85942
Speaker 1: Now, what is Okolona [Arkansas] like?  Can you tell of about that?
Speaker 2: I don't have any recollection of any consequence of Okolona.  Because, the last time I visited there, I was nine years old.  And, it seemed to me that when I was very young, four, five, six, whenever we would go back to Arkansas is because someone had died and we were attending a funeral.  But at that time, my parents--all of their family, except for the ones who moved to Kansas City [Missouri] or Chicago [Illinois], was still located in Arkansas and their friends were too.  So, they were still fairly young people and they would revisit the place of their birth and the place of their growing up.  So, even though I had no connection with it, they did.  And, it was just coincidental that we would go back when someone would pass away.
Speaker 1: I was wondering, if it was a large black population there, I mean compared to where we are.  Was it in the hills?
Speaker 2: The land as I recall was rather flat.  But, the population of the town was somewhere around 600 people.  So, it was very small.  Obviously, very rural.  There were no paved roads.  That I do remember.  No electricity.  Everyone's house was lighted by kerosene lamp.  No indoor plumbing.  No running water.  You had to get water out of a well and even some of the wells had this protective boarder.  You know like in the postcards where the well is circular and has a little wooden shed over the opening.  Some of the wells were not like that, they were simply dug wells, with large planks over them to keep debris out and to keep people from falling in accidentally.  So, it was a very rural area.  I don't recall seeing any signs of industry or businesses.  The only things that I saw that I can recall, were a railroad station, very small, a couple of, I guess--they weren't even Mom and Pop stores, they were either Mom or Pop stores, they were so small and that was it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, I, you know, as a youngster, five or six or seven, you're more focused on playing with the other kids as opposed to making some economic observation or looking at the politics of the area.
Speaker 1: Were there a church there?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Was there a church there for the black community?
Speaker 2: There was a church there.  I remember the church.  I remember the cemetery.  But, that's about it.  I do remember once when we were there, my father [Derex Beard, Sr.] spoke to the congregation.  That's the first, first time I've ever seen my father speak publicly to any group of people.  But, at that point, of course, he and my mom had relocated to St. Louis [Missouri] and we came home to visit.  And, they acknowledged people coming back and my dad stood up after the sermon had been rendered and made a few remarks.  Which I thought was impressive.  Yeah.  Obviously, I haven't forgotten it, so.
Story_ID: 85943
Speaker 1: Now, are there any stories about slavery or about 19th Century life or reconstruction or, you know, passed down through your family?
Speaker 2: No.  I just remember general characterizations about very few, very general, about growing up in Arkansas.  Not, my growing up, but that of my parents [Derex Beard, Sr. and Gladys Cook Beard] and the reason they left is because they didn't want their children to live in the same kind of environment in which they did.  No opportunity.  No, you know, very little hope.  Very little chance of fulfilling your dreams.  They saw the limitations.  But, as a child, I didn't.  But, looking back, reading a little history, talking to people who were, you know, living there when my parents were living there.  Their family members who moved also.  Like a sister and brother who lived in Chicago [Illinois].  They all grew up in Okolona [Arkansas], but left at a fairly young age.  And, there were still brothers and sisters who never left Arkansas.  Not, of my mother.  But, of my dad.  Because there were nine brothers and three sisters.  And, on my dad's side, and I'm trying to think, almost all of the brothers left except three, okay, four, and two of the sister's left.  One sister moved to Kansas City [Missouri] and the other sister move the Springfield, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, the brothers who left moved to Kansas City.
Story_ID: 85944
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, did you know much about your grandfather, the one that you were in the photo with?
Speaker 2: No.  Not really.  Because me again, only visited Arkansas on very few occasions and then it was to attend a funeral generally, as I recall it.
Speaker 1: Was he basically a farmer?
Speaker 2: Everybody was a sharecropper and that was it.  Very few owned businesses that I know of.  I could have a sort of deficient view of what was happening down there.  But, as I recall, they all were sharecroppers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, you grandfather's name was Lawson Beard?
Speaker 2: My paternal grandfather, Lawson Beard and my paternal grandmother was Mary.  And, my maternal grandfather's name was Sterling and his wife, my maternal grandmother was Willie Mae.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Cook.  On my mother's side the name was Cook.  On my father's side the name was Beard.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 85945
Speaker 1: Tell us about your father.  I'm gonna ask you about your mother [Gladys Cook Beard] too, but--what was--can you state his name and spell it for us and (simultaneously).
Speaker 2: Sure.  Derex D-E-R-E-X, Beard B-E-A-R-D, same as mine.  He's Derex Beard, Sr., because my second brother is a junior.  And, he was born in 1911.  Same town, Okolona, Arkansas.  I can imagine what it was like in rural Arkansas in the late 1920, you know, 1919, 1920 because he went only to the fourth grade.  But, he was literate.  He could read and write.  He was a man of great patience, wisdom, understanding, compassion, not a lot of words.  But, he meant, meant what he said and said what he meant.  And, I try to let that be part of my personality.  I don't know if I'm successful, but every memory I have of my dad, is a fond memory.  We lost him five years ago [1997].  But, I only have warm thoughts when I think of him.  He was a great father and when he passed, everybody always, at least the immediate family reflected on there being essentially an absence of any negative memories about him.  Everything was positive or very positive.  He was a family man and he wanted to make sure that we grew up with this sort of sense of self-confidence, self-worth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, we're dependable and attained good reputation in the community.  And, he told that, at least to me, I don't know if he confided in my other siblings, that it made him feel good when neighbors and friends always make comments to him about how we had positive images, you know, and you have good kids.  And, I always respected him.  There's nobody I respected more than I respect my father.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what did you father do for a living?
Speaker 2: When he and my mom left Arkansas, this had to be what, '38 [1938], 1938 he went to Kansas City [Missouri] initially because the matriarch of the family, which is my Aunt Anne, she moved to Kansas City--she was the first person in the extended family to leave Arkansas.  And, she moved to Kansas City, so that had to be probably in the late 19--, mid the late '30 [1930], '35 [1935], '36 [1936].  She moved to Kansas City.  My mom and dad moved there shortly after she did.  And, I didn't know what my dad did when they were living in Kansas City for that short period of time.  But, then they moved to St. Louis [Missouri].  When they moved to St. Louis, I'm guessing it was probably was, like 1939, he started working for the Missouri Pacific Railroad as a boiler maker helper.  And, at that time, of course, steam engines were still very much en vogue although diesels were beginning to make inroads into the railroad industry.  But, anyway, he was, he was an assistant boiler maker, then he became a broiler maker, and then he became an electrician.  And, he stayed with the Missouri Pacific Railroad for about forty years before he retired.  So, so, that's what he did.  My mom, did you ask me about my mom, or just my dad?
Speaker 1: Not yet.
Speaker 2: Not yet.  Okay.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously).
Speaker 2: Yeah, that, that's what my dad did.  And, I think I must have been 14 or 15--he had two jobs.  He was working for the railroad in the day and in the evening and on the weekends, he drove a cab, you know, so he's a two job person.
Speaker 1: He was doing everything he could to help.
Speaker 2: Yeah, everything he could to take care of his family and to be a good provide in which he was, you know.  Considering the limits that were place on black males especially since the--1628.
Story_ID: 85946
Speaker 1: You know.
Speaker 2: Did he [Derex Beard, Sr.] have any outside activities at all?  Did he sing or did he--was he a member of the Mason's or any of that kind of stuff?  Or, church?
Speaker 1: He was a hunter and a fisherman.  Those are the two activities.  Because, you know, growing up in [Okolona] Arkansas, its, it's like, I guess everybody (laughter) was a hunter and a fisherman because it wasn't essentially a recreational--you're talking about survival.  So, people hunted and caught a lot of their own food.  So, that's something that he did and he didn't stop doing until, you know, later on, I guess when he was like in his early 70s, he stopped.  But, he and the brother next to me, Otis Charles [Beard], they use, they used to hunt.  And, some of what I know about my dad's early experiences, I got through Otis Charles, his nickname is "Bud," through him about his conversations with my father when they would engage in these casual conversations during these hunting excursions, about his growing up.  And, it's still scant, because he didn't talk about his youth that much, yeah.  And, I could image he wasn't particularly a happy experience.  I'm just guessing, I don't know.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, where did--his name is very unusual.  I've never heard that name.
Speaker 1: That I don't know.  I haven't either.  Except for my brother, Derex, Jr.  But, I don't know.  I don't know the origin of Derex.  I don't know how he got it.
Speaker 2: So, you never asked him?
Speaker 1: I never did.  Because, I never thought of him as Derex.  I thought of him as dad, you know.  That's all I've ever called him, I don't know.  I never thought of it.
Story_ID: 85947
Speaker 1: Alright.  Well, tell us about your mother.  Can you give us her full name and spell it for us?  And, her date and place of birth.
Speaker 2: Gladys, maiden name Cook, no "e".  C-O-O-K, Beard, B-E-A-R-D.  And, she is 19 years older than I am.  So, when I was born, she was 19 so, I guess she was born, what, 1928.  Is that right?  Nineteen-eighteen [1918], I'm sorry, 19--she was 1918, June 26th, we have the same birth number.  My birth is December the 26th, her date is June 26th, but she was born in 1918 in Okolona, Arkansas.  And, I know that she, I know that she had one sister and one brother.  And, his name, her brother's name was Sterling, he was named after his father, but not a junior, just had the same name and her sister's name is Charlene.  And, Sterling and Charlene live in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.  They still there?
Speaker 2: Charlene is still living.  My aunt Charlene is still living.  My uncle Sterling passed away about three years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mom is still alive.
Speaker 1: Now, well, what was your mother like in those days and what did she do for a living?
Speaker 2: She used to talk more about what she did as a youngster than my dad [Derex Beard, Sr.] did.  She liked to sing.  I never said she was good at it.  I just (laughter) said, she like to sing.  She used to paint.  And, that's something that she sort of continued to do through much of her live.  Not with a great deal of commitment, but took art classes and had the paints and the easels and--around the house.  And, painted, probably had a couple of shows through the church, and so forth and so on.
Speaker 1: What did she use?  Did she use--
Speaker 2: Oil.
Speaker 1: Oil?
Speaker 2: Oil, on the canvas.  And, she mentioned to me that when she was in high school, 'cause she went to Okolona High School [Arkansas], which at that time obviously would have been an all-black school.  I think she went to high school for two years.  And, she was part of a girl's singing group, and I can't remember the name of it.  "The Holiday Sisters" or some--they had a name.  And, she use to talk about how they would sing at various places.  The songs of the day, whatever they were.  And, she tried to play the guitar, but she was never good at that either.  But, but she--you know, she tried.
Speaker 1: She seemed like an artist, when she--
Speaker 2: Yeah, she had, she had an interest in the arts, she did.
Story_ID: 85948
Speaker 1: And, as a matter of fact, she [Gladys Cook Beard] made sure that we were somehow exposed to social and artistic and cultural things.  For example, St. Louis had a great museum, the St. Louis City Art Museum [sic, Saint Louis Art Museum], it's in Forest Park, which is in the west end of the City.  And, when we were youngsters, I was a youngster and obviously my two brothers, the ones next to me, were very young, but she used to take us out to the art museum.  And, she would spend a lot of time out there on frequent occasions, just looking at the exhibits.  You know, the paintings, the statuary, the relics, because the Osage [Nation] Indian Tribes were in that part of the country, around Missouri.  And, you have arrowheads and crafts and things like that on display.  And, the history of Missouri demonstrated through genre paintings that would be on display, I remember that.  But, attending folk festivals.  It was more of a European oriented kind of presentation, but nevertheless, she would make sure that we saw that.  See performances of the St. Louis Symphony [Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra], and I remember the director of the St. Louis Symphony for so many years.  His name is Vladimir Golschmann.  That I remember.  But, we use to go to those functions and there used to be musical concerts at Kiel Auditorium, performances more than concerts.  But, people like [Charles Melvin] "Cootie" Williams, and Count Basie, Duke Ellington, would come to the, you know, the Kiel Auditorium and the family would attend those things.  They would have function, which--there was a large facility in St. Louis, called the St. Louis Arena.  It was I guess, it would be comparable to the Super Dome [New Orleans, Louisiana], only much smaller 'cause it was probably built in the 1920's.  But, the point is, it was large enough to accommodate, what you might call substantial events.  And, they would have things like the, well, let me rephrase this.  In St. Louis, they would have fundraising events twice a year.  One was called the Police Circus and one was call the Fireman's Rodeo.  And, it was really to raise money to have a widow and orphan's fund for those fireman and policeman who were either disabled or killed in action in the performance of the service of the community.  So, those events occurred separately and regularly and my parents always made sure that we attended those.  And, they had a very, very large zoo [St. Louis Zoo] and a very, very large park in St. Louis called Forest Park.  And, they used to have the animal shows, you know, with the lions and the tigers.  They used to have elephants.  They used to have monkeys, and they actually did the kind of displays and exhibitions that you would expect in an amusement park.  And, she made sure that we attended all of those.  And, inside the park they would have the reptile house, the bird house aviary, where there would be various species of birds and reptiles on display-- terrapins, turtles, iguanas, you name them.  And, we would always, you know, be exposed to those kinds of things, so it was, it was interesting.  And, that was primarily my mother's focus-- to make sure that we were exposed to those kinds of things.  My participation to YMCA, all of that.
Story_ID: 85949
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there a story about how your mother [Gladys Cook Beard] and father [Derex Beard, Sr.] met?
Speaker 2: Not revealed to me by either of them.  But, you know in a town [Okolona, Arkansas] of six hundred people, you met everybody, with great frequency, you know, so.  Now, I don't--no, it was never, no.  Probably, it was such a small town that you don't meet people, you just sorta grow up knowing people. You know what I'm talking about?  There's no revelation that somebody exist.
Speaker 1: So, they didn't talk about how they became to know each other?
Speaker 2: Naw.  She may have mentioned it to my sister [Paula Smith], but neither of them ever mentioned it to me, you know, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there--I know they left for economic opportunity, but why St. Louis [Missouri], is it because it's the closest place or what?
Speaker 2: That's something else never discussed as to why they came to St. Louis.  But, remember they first went to Kansas City [Missouri].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I guess, it's probably out of a, sort of the tradition of going north.  And in the, you know, from Arkansas, north is, what, Chicago [Illinois], St. Louis, just like here on the, on the east coast, people went north from North Carolina, Georgia, South Carol [Carolina]--to any, any place on the east coast.  Some of the people went to California.  Some went to Texas.  But, most, most of my family went to St. Louis, Kansas City, or Chicago.  And, I guess its north being more attractive than, and probably more popular, and connected with running away from slavery.  You know, going north, you know, follow the North Star.  And, I'm just guessing, but that's probably it.  I'm trying to think of the way I would think and if I was leaving, I'd say "give me a ticket."  How far north will this money take me and that's probably what I would do and that's probably what they did.  Except, their decision may have be prompted by the fact that my aunt was in Kansas City.  Okay, and again she's the matriarch of the family and they probably went when she went.  Because, she was the first to go and everyone else went to Kansas City and obviously disbursed to other parts of the country, but that was the starting point after leaving.
Speaker 1: Excuse me, were there any other relatives in St. Louis when they were there, or were they the--?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.  Aunt Stella and I don't know if Aunt Stella was the sister of my mother's father or my mother's mother, 'cause she was my mother's aunt.  She moved to St. Louis and she and her husband, Uncle Hoosie [ph.].  They were from Arkansas.  And, those are the--I'm sorry, and then there was another family member, and his name was Uncle Buck and his name was Hoosie [ph.] as well.  I think he was related to my mother.  In other words, she was my mother's--uncle on my mother's side.  He was from Arkansas and he was about--he was a little older than my dad.  So, he and his wife, Aunt Tess.  Her name was really Tessolla [ph.], but she--he and Aunt Tess moved from Okolona also and they moved to St. Louis.  So, those are the only relatives that I know of, who were in Arkansas who moved to St. Louis throughout our family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, there was a little group there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 85950
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, I want you to reflect back on your childhood and give us a sense of, what it was like to grow up--like what were--can you described some of the sights, and sounds, and smells of growing up for us?
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I remember the address:  4366 West Belle [St. Louis, Missouri].  That's, that's where I spent the early, early formative years.  And, I do know that every place that was significant to me was within walking distance.  But, that's usually true, I guess, when you fi--in other words, not like now where parents actually have the capacity and maybe the necessity to transport their kids to various places.  We didn't have a car, so I wasn't transported (laughter) anywhere.  But, we walked to just about every place; the grocery store, the shoe repair stop--shop, the drug store, church, school.  Even visiting relatives, we could walk.  The distance would be five or six blocks.  For example, my Aunt Stella and Uncle Hoosie [ph.], there was only a four block, five block walk.  To visit my Uncle Hoosie [ph.] and Tessolla, that was probably a fifteen block walk, so we took the street car to visit them.  But, it was a walkable distance, I guess.  Certainly, based on my parents experience because when they were growing up in Okolona [Arkansas], they walked for much greater distances than that.  But, whenever we visited them, it was usually take a cab or take the street car.  But, it was--their house and our house was only one block off the street car line, if you know what I'm talking about.  Walk a block, get on a street car and go to where their house was and get off and just walk across the street, so it was readily accessible.  But, you would walk just about every place you knew, and I seem to recall that I knew just about everybody that I would see during the course of the day and everyone knew me.  Not because of my identity but because they knew your parents.  But, I think that was generally true.  Everybody knew everyone.  At least, for a block or so and they knew all their children.  And, the children knew all the other children and all the parents.  I do remember feeling fundamentally secure in the neighborhood and there was a church a block away, Lane Tabernacle [C.M.E.] Church and it had a big yard.  And, we used to go over there and play all the time.  And, when I say play, I mean, I'm not talking about structured activity.  Some of it consists of no more than wrestling, and pushing and running.  But, it was, it was playing and it was secure, fenced in, off the street.  And, eventually they put up a basketball court.  Not a court, but a basketball hoop, okay, you know, a one hoop basketball court.  And, we played, recreated a lot.  I do remember walking down the street and I just knew the name of everybody and everybody knew who I was.
Story_ID: 86285
Speaker 1: Your question was about the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, did the--
Speaker 1: Residential area being designated as black.  As I recall, black population lived much through the central City of St. Louis [Missouri].  Starting from the downtown commercial area, it's going right through almost the city limits, up to perhaps, the middle of the city for a long time.  Which is sorta Kingshighway, which is a city--it ran north and south.  A major street that ran north and south, virtually across the city.  But, far downtown that is beyond the commercial area, but moving toward the central city, had a substantial black population.  And, that continued up to Kingshighway.  And, I'm talking about the '40s [1940s].  On the other side of Kingshighway, other side of Kingshighway that is west, not too many black people lived.  But, the width of the black community in the central part of the city, east of Kingshighway was substantial.  Now, there was another meaningful pocket of black citizens on the south side of the city.  But, I never knew where those boundaries were.  I just heard them refer to, the "south side."  But, where it was geographically, I had no idea.  And there was, of course, another part of the south side which was totally European.  It's an Italian section.  There's where Joe Garagiola [Sr.] and Yogi Berra grew up.  They call it "The Hill" Section.  I never knew where it was, I just heard it referred to.  And, then there was a north side, which went in the other direction toward a street called Natural Bridge.  And, the black population for a substantial time did not live north of Natural Bridge.  And, then of course the housing patterns changed.  They changed noticeably in the '60s [1960s].  But, I'm talking about in the '40s [1940s], when these identifications of demarcations were fairly well-known, especially by adults.  And, I didn't know them first hand.  I would just hear them referred to.  Ultimately, we--and we lived in the central, central section of the city, which I indicated, West Belle, the 4300 of West Belle.  But, when I was in the sixth grade, we moved from there to the north side, toward Natural Bridge in St. Louis.  Which is kinda interesting because the neighborhood to which we moved, was the same neighborhood that got some recognition in the '40s [1940s], because there was a case decided by the United States Supreme Court called Shelley vs. Kraemer [1948].  And, the outcome of that case was, it was essentially unconstitutional for a court system to enforce a racial restricted covenant that was contained in a deed that conveyed a house from one person or one group of persons to another.  Because, many deeds to homes had provisions that this house cannot be sold to a person of African descent and also Filipinos and Asians.  And, this is something I wasn't aware of when I was obviously 10, 12 years of age.  But, it was only after becoming an adult that I realized that this was significant when it was rendered by the Supreme Court in the '40s [1940s], Shelley vs. Kraemer Decision.  Anyway, the neighborhood to which we moved, 2924 North Taylor, was toward Natural Bridge and it was in that area where this case originated, Shelley vs. Kraemer.

Speaker 1: Now, was St. Louis [Missouri] segregated in the sense of (simultaneously).
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  The City of St. Louis had a segregated school system.  As a matter of fact, the fall of 1954, when they implemented that decision [Brown v. Board of Education], I think the decision was rendered in the spring, before the spring semester in '54 [1954] had concluded.  And, I remember, one of my teachers, a civics teacher, Dr. Warren St. James, interrupting class, said, "I'll be right back", and he left the class.  And, we thought that was kind of unusual behavior.  And, he came back and he mentioned to us that the United States Supreme Court just rendered a decision, that says it was uncon--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously).
Speaker 2: It's the Brown Decision.  But, we didn't know it was pending.  And, at that time, how old was I?  Sixteen.  I didn't know it was pending.  And, I didn't understand the significances of it, but I was somewhat concerned about having to go to another school and leave my classmates.  But, the City of St. Louis had, I believe, made plans to implement a desegregation plan before that decision was rendered, okay.  And, if you were going to be a junior forthcoming fall semester, no matter where you lived, you were not required to transfer to a new school.  So, that didn't affect me and I was very relieved to find out that I would stay with my friends at my high school, [Charles H.] Sumner High School, by the way.  The high school of Arthur Ashe, [HM] Dick Gregory, Grace Bumbry, a few other people.  But, I was relieved that I wouldn't have to move.  But, they did desegregate the schools and they did it with, as I recall, without any difficulty.  They may have been some problems, but in the mains, as far as I know, there wasn't.  Certainly, there wasn't the kind of situation you had in Little Rock [Arkansas], and other places where the transition--
Speaker 1: They had a lot of violence?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Nothing like that, nothing like that at all.  But, Sumner High School is the school I attended and it was really in walking distance.  Again, as I said earlier, I can walk everywhere I had to go.  It was in walking distance of where I lived.
Speaker 1: Now, tell me about--
Speaker 2: Can I mention one thing?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: They had two black academic high schools in St. Louis.  Sumner High School and Vashon [High School].  Vashon was located, again, in the eastern part of the city.  And, remember what I said about we--us--that is my family living in sort of the central--
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: portion?  Well, the Sumner sorta serviced the central residents, and Vashon, the eastern part of the city.  And, then there was Washington Tech [Booker T. Washington Technical High School], which was a technical high school.  A black technical high school, well the black technical high school.  So, we had two academic, and one technical high school in St. Louis.
Story_ID: 86287
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now where did you go to grade school?  And, tell me about grade school.  And, how you like grade school?
Speaker 2: I started at Cole Elementary School and it was located, as I recall, on--near Vandeventer and Enright [St. Louis, Missouri].  And, now, I started when I was five years old.  You're in Kindergarten and then I stayed in the school until I was in the sixth grade.  It was four, four blocks from where I lived, so I walked to school.  I think that grade school was just sort of unremarkable.  There were-it's sorta like, my dad [Derex Beard, Sr.] goes to work.  My mom [Gladys Cook Beard] stays home and takes care of us and I go to school.  Sort of like my job, and that's the way I view it.  I do remember, as I think most people, some of the kids that I went to grade school with, and obviously many of them I've forgotten.  But, it was just pleasant.  It wasn't unpleasant.  Had my share of fights.  Not that many, you know.  Liked--
Speaker 1: So it was like (simultaneously)
Speaker 2: almost all of my teachers.  I can't think of anyone I disliked.  But, I can't--I liked, I liked all--most of them were female.  Because at that time in St. Louis, if you're a woman, it was prohibited being married.  And, you find out later that some of them were married anyway, they just didn't reveal it to the school board.  But, woman teachers had to be single.  It, it's strange now but we're talking about the 1940s.  And, the teachers obviously, all black school, all my teachers, the principal, were all black as well, school in a black neighborhood, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now you were at Cole School through--
Speaker 2: Cole.  C-O--
Speaker 1: sixth grade?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Cole School.  And, that's when my parents moved to the Taylor address and I--my second grammar school was Cote Brilliante, C-O-T-E, Brillant with and "e".  I guess in French it would be Cote Brilliante.  But, we call it Cote Brilliant, okay.  And, that's where I stayed until I graduated from grammar school in 1952.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, did you all have a middle school or junior high school?
Speaker 2: No, they didn't have a middle school system.  The academic here was broken up in high and low.  We called it, you know like, you were in 3rd grade for a year, three low and three high.  The low being the first part of the academic year, high being the second part-- fall semester, spring semester.  So, it was just high, low, high, low, grade school or grammar school up until the eighth grade, then, high school, nine through 12th.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, then I graduated from grade school in '52 [1952], and Sumner High School in '56 [1956].
Story_ID: 86288
Speaker 1: Now, what about Hi--
Speaker 2: Charles H. Sumner High School [St. Louis, Missouri].
Speaker 1: Yeah, Charles Sumner the abolitionist from--
Speaker 2: Right, from Pennsylvania--was it Pennsylvania or Mass?
Speaker 1: Massachusetts.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Mass--I knew he was an abolitionist and a senator, but I didn't know--I wasn't sure about the state.
Speaker 1: There's a statue of him at Harvard Square [Cambridge, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Yeah, really?  Yeah.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously).
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, when he died he wanted--he insisted on being buried in a black cemetery, yeah, so.  Well, he insisted I guess, before (laughter) he died.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But, yeah the other way (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I'm sorry, (laughter) forgive me.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) yeah.  So, well tell me about Sumner High School.  What kind of activities were you involved in at Sumner High School?  What were your favorite subjects and all, you know, too?
Speaker 2: I liked Physics, as I recall.  Physics and History, I think, more than anything else.  Those were my two favorite subjects.  The rest of them, I don't remember as much as I do the teachers.  You know what I'm talking about, maybe that's unusual.  But, I do remember being impressed by some of the teachers with whom I had classes, some of the teachers which whom I had no class.  But, I for some reason thought they were interesting people with noticeable personalities, but almost without exception, they seem to have the interest of us at heart.  They were very, very concerned about us as students.  I think you can understand what I'm talking about.  It's possible to do your job as a professional.  But, make it abundantly clear that the students are simply the students: "I'm the teacher or the principal, I do my job, you do yours and that's basically it."  But, I think they felt that they had a personal investment in us.  And, I--it could have been because they all lived in the same neighborhood we did, you have to understand.  The school where we lived, where we work, housing really hadn't lost its racial structure at that time.  So, there's a very strong likelihood that you were gonna see your teachers outside of the school.  Your parents are gonna see them at a grocery store or the church or some social function, or some entertainment facility.  So, you saw people at school and away from school, who were your teachers.  And, for many of us, our parents had gone to school with some of our teachers.  And, if that were not the case, they still may have some association with them in some other connection, you know.  Like maybe a parent may have been a barber and the barber of one of his teachers, that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: Or hairdresser, or insurance salesman.  But, the contact was there.  In St. Louis, even though it was, I'd say a sizeable city, it wasn't a metropolis like Chicago [Illinois], New York [New York City, New York], or Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  It's just a noticeable city.  And, so the contact among members of the black community was probably more intense and with greater frequency then it might have been otherwise.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I guess especially if you're--if the black community is living in pockets around the city--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: In the city--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Than any little pocket is like a little village (simultaneously).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Right.  True.
Story_ID: 86289
Speaker 1: And, your question about what it was like, the teachers and my activities [at Charles H. Sumner High School in St. Louis, Missouri]--
Speaker 2: Can you name some of the teachers that were particularly interesting, you know?
Speaker 1: Mr. Green, O.V. Green, he taught Chemistry.  He was an ultimate gentleman.  He talked like a gentleman, had a--he looked like a gentleman, dressed like a gentleman, and he--whenever he talked to the students, whether they'd be fourteen or eighteen, he talked to you as if you were a thirty-five years old adult- addressed everybody as mister.  Can you imagine a man in his middle fifties, who looks like he probably should be President of the United States, talking to someone fifteen years of age and saying "Mr. so-and-so" or "Ms. so-and-so," you know, with a slight smile.  Not a grin, slight smile.  And, you know, extending to you about as much respect as he could.  And, you have to admire a person who does that.  He was not one of my teachers, but I just remember him having that kind of bearing and that kind of demeanor, and seriousness about his job.  And, prompting us to be serious young people.  I think my group, and I'm sort of getting off the track for a little bit about your question, but being born in '37 [1937], when I was ten years of age, that's when Jackie Robinson came into baseball.  And, my teachers, I remember when I was kindergarten, first grade, second grade, they say "things are changing DeLawrence," "things are changing young men", "things are changing young women," "you have to prepare yourself," you know.  This is--things are changing.  That was the phrase.  Things are changing.  This is--Jackie Robinson coming into baseball became significate, socially, politically, emotionally, and all my friends and I were all Brooklyn Dodger fans even though the St. Louis Cardinals were there.  They were a National League team.  The St. Louis Browns were there too.  There was an American League team.  We all rooted for the Brooklyn Dodgers.  Some didn't.  But, they were outcast (laughter) okay.  So, but, anyway, that was a change that was significant.  And, our teachers would prompt us to do well in school, to take life seriously, and sometimes it took and sometimes it didn't.  But, the point is, the message was constantly offered.  So, we saw, growing up, things change.  Piecemeal, but they change.  I remember when Ralph Bunche won the Nobel Peace Prize [1950], okay.  That was significant.
Story_ID: 86290
Speaker 1: Plus, we [St. Louis, Missouri] had black newspapers at that--we still do I guess, but at that time white newspapers, the mainstream newspapers, and magazines didn't report events in the black community.  But, they were reported in the--at the St. Louis Argus and the St. Louis American, black newspapers you get the news.  But, every--
Speaker 2: The St. Louis American is still publishing, right?
Speaker 1: (unclear) and probably St. Louis Argus too.  But, and there may be an additional African American newspaper there that, that I don't know about.  But, in any case, teachers were prompting people to exert themselves to try, to try harder.  The interesting thing, even the athletic system among high schools that were segregated.  They had a public school Christmas basketball tournament that only the white schools could participate in, and of course, that changed in '55 [1955].  And, of course, when they changed it, you know, Sumner High School participated in it and won it.  And, won it every year, probably still winning it, as far as I know.  But, "Jet Magazine," "Ebony Magazine," they started when I was a youngster.  As a matter of fact, I use to sell a publication called the "Negro Digest," which was the precursor to "Ebony Magazine," from door-to-door in the black community.  I did that for probably about two months.  And, then "Ebony" came out, covered nationally what was happening in the black community.  So, a lot of the black people saw what other black people are doing as a, you know, which, which was significant.  And, then "Jet Magazine" came out, different kind of publication.  But, you became more aware of what's happening across the country.  And, that was sort of reinforcing the point that the teachers were trying to get across to us.  Because, yeah, you saw teachers other than your parents- they were the people you saw on a regular basis.  They, you know, came from a different, slightly different world than we did.  Some of them attended segregated schools, some didn't.  Some attended schools in the East that we hadn't even heard about in the main.  Because a number of us still who were college oriented were thinking about going to black institutions.  You know, like Lincoln University, who had just--University in Missouri in Jefferson City, which is the Capital, so.  Oh, the teachers I remember.  I remember Mr. Green, obviously.  My initial advisory, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Skinner, who was advisory during junior year.  Ms. Haley, who was my advisory my freshmen year.  Brown was my sophomore year.  But, Mr. English, I--you know, I just, I just remember the names.  Ms. Davis, Mr. Buckner, I remember almost all of them, all of them--
Story_ID: 86291
Speaker 1: When you were in school [Charles H. Sumner High School in St. Louis, Missouri] did you have a--was there a general feeling in you that you were going to go on to college and--
Speaker 2: No.  Absolutely not.  I had a mild curiosity about going to college.  But, I thought of it--I knew my parents [Derex Beard, Sr. and Gladys Cook Beard] couldn't send me.  I surely didn't have the money in the bank, because I was of the mind that you had to have the money in the bank before you could start.  I didn't, so I was sort of oriented toward just getting a job when I graduated from high school, which is what I did.  I graduated from high school [in 1956] and a friend of mine had a job working for a fur company, driving a truck basically.
Story_ID: 86292
Speaker 1: Just to backtrack a second.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: In high school, were you involved in activity (simultaneously)?
Speaker 2: Basketball.
Speaker 1: Basketball, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, basketball.  I played basketball.  I loved it, okay.  But, I wasn't particularly talented (laughter), but I still liked to play.  I played a lot of basketball, okay.  And, I liked music.  I wasn't a musician, but I did like to listen to music.  Especially jazz, which I still do.  I still listen to a lot of jazz and blues.  Some classical music as well.
Speaker 1: Jazz, I guess was the popular music when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Very, very popular.  As a matter of fact, you know, we claim Miles Davis, you know, and some of the other people, Oliver Nelson, Arvell Shaw.  The people who--Grant Green from St. Louis, and they proved to be stellar, stellar performers in the music world, you know.  Ernie Wilkins, just a very strong tradition.  That old business about jazz coming up the Mississippi River from New Orleans [Louisiana] and all that, you know, but (laughter) it may be some truth to it.  But anyway, jazz was big and I liked to listen to music, as I indicated, and still do.  And, did I get side tracked, or did I deviate?
Speaker 1: Naw.  I tried to just, take you back to some of the activities in high school.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did you run for class office or any of that kinda stuff?
Speaker 2: No, I did not.  But, I did, but I did work after school.  I think one--from the time I was fourteen until the time I graduated.  I worked after school from 3:30 to 6:30 at a neighborhood grocery store called Mueller's.  It's a German name.  It's spelled M-U-E-L-L-E-R, Mr. Mueller.  And, we did virtually everything; delivered grocery, stocked the shelves, cleaned up the store, and waited on people, you know, at the counter, you know, checked them out.  One cash register.  And, there were two of us and then there was another--two other guys who came in on Saturdays.  So, the two guys who worked every day, Monday through Friday; a friend of mine named John Hopkins.  John and I worked Monday through Friday- and there was a kid by the name of Palmer Hubbard.  Palmer used to work on Saturday and John Ward.  He used to work on Saturdays.  Because the shopping was heavier, and you needed four people inside the store.  So, these guys would do the deliveries and you know, you stayed inside the store.  I did that every, every day after school, for the whole time I was in high school.
Story_ID: 86293
Speaker 1: When did the store [Mueller's] close?
Speaker 2: Oh, I have no idea.  But, if you, if you had visited a major city especially, not necessarily a major city, but the city you grew up in and if you're my age and you go back, it doesn't look anything like you remember.  The houses are either gone or boarded up.  The trees have been removed and you don't see any people.  And, there's nothing of a commercial nature in the neighborhood.  You know, like a neighborhood grocery store.  It's hard to find neighborhood grocery stores now, okay.  You have to go to the store as opposed to--by way of car or other vehicles as opposed to being able to walk.  Unless you live near the store.  But, the neighborhood grocery store, the neighborhood everything, is, is a thing of the past.  So, I---it has been gone for, for years.
Story_ID: 86294
Speaker 1: But, when I graduated [from Charles H. Sumner High School in St. Louis, Missouri in 1956] I worked for a while.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But, did you take the college course of study in school?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Because you took Physics, and what was that?
Speaker 1: I took academic courses that would have qualified me or prepared me to go to college.  But, not having the money--when I say not having the money, I never thought about scholarship or grants and aide or work study program--
Speaker 2: Your counselors never told you about that kinda--?
Speaker 1: No not really.  No, no.  And, I just wasn't particularly, didn't have a particularly strong academic orientation, you know.  I like courses, but I never, I never pursued academic excellence the way some college orientated people did, because some students knew they were going to go to college when they were born.  That decision had been made for them (laughter) by their parents or by their grandparents.  That wasn't so in my case.  It was, I was going to graduate from high school.  That was clear.
Speaker 2: You were thinking about a job--
Speaker 1: Right.  Just get a job and, you know, make some money and, you know, just sort of, I won't use the word coast, but just sort of live like everybody else, whatever that means.  Be gainfully employed and that's about it.
Speaker 2: So, you were driving a truck for a furrier, you said?
Speaker 1: Um-hum, fur company, yeah.  But, I only did that for a short period of time.  I did that for maybe seven, eight months.  Then, I left that job and I start working, working for a place called Remmert and Werner [Remmert-Werner, Inc.].  It was an air charter service where they serviced and maintained privately owned aircraft, okay.  And, they serviced the vehicles, made parts for them, and so forth and so on.  So, when I was in high school [Charles H. Sumner High School in St. Louis, Missouri], I took machine shop.  Learned to operate a lathe, so when I was hired by Remmert-Werner, it was really to be a custodian, you know, sweeping up, sweeping up and cleaning up.  And, one of the partners wanted--his name was, I can't remember if it was Mr. [Bill] Remmert or Mr. [Bob] Werner, I think it was Werner.  These guys had two different personalities.  Mr.- I think no, it was Remmert, Bill Remmert.  He was tall, very handsome, Hollywood type, you know.  One day he said, "What can you do other than sweep a floor?"  I said, "I can operate a lathe."  He said, "That's interesting."  Next week, I'm in the machine shop operating a lathe, okay.  He just said, "This kid can operate a lathe, we'll let him operate the lathe," you know.  It was a surprise to me, but anyway, I did that until, for about maybe seven or eight months.  I left that job and went to McDonnell Aircraft, of which you've heard, I'm sure.  Now it's McDonnell Douglas, they merged [in 1967].  But anyway, and I was trained as an electrical and radio mechanic.  Because he had a training program of about a month at McDonnell, month and a half, and that's what I did up until August of 1957.
Story_ID: 86295
Speaker 1: So, I graduated [from Charles H. Sumner High School in St. Louis, Missouri] January, '56 [1956].  August, '57 [1957] is--I left McDonnell Aircraft, went into the [United States] Navy.  Because when I was in high school, I joined the Navy Reserve with my parents' [Derex Beard, Sr. and Gladys Cook Beard] permission.  I think it was probably the beginning of my senior year.  And, we had to go, you know, like the Reserves, one meeting a month, so forth and so on.  And, I went active duty in August of 1957.  Left McDonnell Aircraft and went to the Navy.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, went to Great Lakes Navy Training Center [sic, Naval Station Great Lakes].
Speaker 2: (unclear) near Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Yeah, north of Chicago.  And, then after I left Great Lakes, came home for two weeks going to Norfolk, Virginia, the Naval Base in Norfolk [Naval Station Norfolk].  And, the reason I was going to Norfolk was to join a collection of people who were going to be sent overseas.  So, I was in Norfolk for about a month, doing basically nothing, just waiting to be transported.  And, there came a time when everyone who was to be transported.  All these sailors were put on buses, must have been about 15 or 20 busses and we headed toward McGuire Air Force Base, which is in [Burlington County] New Jersey.  It's near Fort Dix, New Jersey.  And, they, and we all caught planes and we flew to the Mediterranean.  We didn't fly directly to the Mediterranean--but let me tell you about a comment my mother [Gladys Cook Beard] made just before I left to go in Service.  She said, "Remember"--she knew I was going to Norfolk, but she didn't know where I was going when I left Norfolk, okay.  And, she said, "Remember you're not from there, you have no investment there, you have no friends, you have no relatives, don't try to change anything."  In other words, you're going from St. Louis [Missouri], South.  Having born and raised in Arkansas, she says, you know, "You will probably see things that just will make you uncomfortable.  People might confront you for no apparent reason, and it's dangerous."  People will kill you because you're black, okay.  She didn't say that, but I mean, that was her concern, I'm sure, or injure you or there's a certain amount of hostility that which you haven't been exposed, okay.  So, she--don't try to change anything, just go down there, get along and come back home.  Well, I never left the Naval Base for that month that I was there.  I just stayed on Naval Base, you know, you play basketball, watch TV, everything like that, so that was basically it.
Story_ID: 86296
Speaker 1: But anyway, when we went to McGuire Air Force Base [Burlington County, New Jersey] to be transported to Europe, caught the plane and we flew from there to a place called Ayr, A-Y-R, Scotland, near a town call Prestwick and that's where the plane landed.  And, then we went from there to, I think, Glasgow [Scotland] by train.  And, then from Glasgow to London [England] by train.  I'm talking about a bunch of guys, all sailors, okay.  And, then we flew from London--this took place over about three or four days, okay.  Stayed in Prestwick overnight.  Stayed in London for a day or two and then flew from London to Naples [Italy].  And, when I got to Naples, I was put onboard a tanker, called the U.S.S. Aucilla, A-U-S-C-I-L-L-A, and I remember that, being onboard the Aucilla.  For a few days, it got underway.  I got very sea sick.  I've never been on a boat larger than a row boat in my life.  And, we're--
Speaker 2: Even in Navy training?  (Laughter)
Speaker 1: (Laughter) which on (unclear), they teach you to swim, they teach you seamanship, they teach you semaphore, they teach you a lot of things, but they don't put you on a boat.  So, I tell you, being sea sick, if you've ever been sea sick, it's a horrible feeling.  But, anyway, I won't dwell on that.  So, when I was being transported to my ship, which is an aircraft carrier, the Franklin D. Roosevelt CVA-42.  We were at sea and I was onboard this tanker called Aucilla.  They were gonna put me on one boat, transport me from one boat to another boat.  So, they have a process for a procedure called highlining.  So, the boats parallel each other on the ocean, going the same direction, at the same speed, and they have this rigging on the top of the ships.  And, what they do is, it's like a tear gas gun, they will shoot a small rope from one boat to another boat.  And, it goes over there and then they catch it and they take this small rope and pull over a bigger rope.  They hook that to the rigging with a bunch of other suspension apparatus.  And, there's a chair that rides between these riggings while the ships are at sea.  So, they put you in this chair and put a life preserver on, on you, okay.  And, you have this sea bag which is your entire--all your personal possessions.  You've seen the sea bag before, 'cause you see sailor and soldier's carrying them on their shoulders.  Your sea bag is put in a big net along with everybody else' sea bag.  It has your name and your Military ID number on it.  It's hauled over in the big net.  But the people have to be hauled over one by one in this chair.  So, you sit in this chair and you are pulled and the highline is pulled.  The people where you are release the rope.  The people to where you're going pull on it and they pull the chair over this rigging.  You follow?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So anyway, we're--I'm sitting in this chair, we're in the middle of the Mediterranean, okay.  And, what happens, even though these boats are going in the same direction at approximately the same speed, they roll, this way and that way, you know what I'm talking about?  Because an ocean is not a lake.  The water is a little bit rougher.  So, when these boats roll toward each other, like this, they roll independently okay, I mean, you know, pitching, rolling.  The line goes down, which means the chair goes down.
Story_ID: 86093
Speaker 1: So, on the highline when the ships roll toward each other, the line is slacking, the chair goes down.  So, you may be 10 or 12 feet above the top of the ocean, okay.  But, then when they roll toward each other, obviously they gonna, at one time or another, roll away from each other.  And, the consequence of that is, it tightens and you go up in the air, so from being 10 feet off the ocean, you're 75 feet off the ocean, okay.  This happens a couple of times and the first time you do it, it's kinda interesting, but after that, you know, boom.  So, ultimately, I caught my ship, which is the Roosevelt [Franklin D. Roosevelt CVA-42].  It was a carrier, and I believe it was in Naples [Italy].  It was either Naples or Marseille, France, one of the two, I can't remember.  But--no, no, I--we landed in Naples and I got onboard the [U.S.S.] Aucilla and that's when I was transported to a little ship, which landed near the Roosevelt.  But, it was rather interesting because growing up in St. Louis [Missouri], the biggest or largest body of water I've ever seen was the Mississippi River.  And, the land is essentially flat.  It's part of the Great Plaines.  I've never seen a mountain, so when we see Mount Vesuvius, as we're flying into Naples, it's a revelation.  I've never seen a mountain before.  I've seen pictures of mountains, and I thought that was interesting.  I've never seen the ocean before, and there I am almost in the ocean.  So, it was a revelation and something I'll never forget.  And, I'll never forget seeing an aircraft carrier for the first time too, you know, huge.  But, I was aboard that ship for a couple of, couple of years and we moved, you know, from Greece, to Sicily, and Southern France, Italy.
Story_ID: 86094
Speaker 1: I saw a number of cities in Italy and Florence, Genoa, Livorno.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) on the ship?
Speaker 1: I was in what they call a fire control.  It's not fire putting out, but the fire control system is the gunnery system.  It's the computers, its radar, integrators that actually control the guns onboard the ship.  The only guns that we had of any consequence were 5"/54's [5"54 caliber Mark 42].  In other words, the boar of the barrel was five inches and the length of the barrel was 54 times five.  That's how long it was.  And, they call them 5"/54's.  And, that's what I did.  I didn't have any sort of technical training on the equipment, but you know, sort of what they call a striker.  That means you're sort of learning to utilize the equipment.  But, it wasn't really a technically oriented job.  But, when I was in the [U.S.] Navy, I remember one officer, can't remember his last name.  But, one day he spoke to me and he says, "You know, they're interested in recruiting people for the LDO Program, which is a Limited Duty Officer Program.  The top commander, the top rank being Commander and you could pursue that if you attended OCS, Officer Candidate School.  And, he said, "Your scores are such that if you were interested, I will recommend you for--as a candidate for Officer Candidate School.  It doesn't mean I would be admitted.  It means I, at least at that point, qualified for the recommendation.  And, I said, "Thank you, I'm flattered, but no thanks."  Because having been in the Navy for the period of time that I was in, it was at that point that I decided when I get out--I am now serious about going to college.  Whereas I hadn't been before.  And, I remember when I had that quote "epiphany."  Well, not quote, but a revelation.  It was when I caught the Roosevelt and we came back to the United States, you went to New York for the ship to be refitted, reconditioned, and so forth and so on.  And, when we left New York, we went south to Cuba, Haiti, The Virgin Islands, in what is called a shakedown cruise.  It's to get the kinks out of the overhaul of the ship.  But, when we left New York, we stopped at Norfolk [Virginia] to take on munitions because when your ship is refitted, obviously you have welders and all these people onboard.  They take the munitions off, the rockets, the bombs, they take all the stuff off.--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously)
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So then, have a catastrophic accidental result.  So, we left New York, went to Norfolk and we were on the loading party.  Which means, now the bombs, the rockets, and the bullets come back onboard the ship and somebody has to load them.  Well, there was an Ensign, his name was Trunso, T-R-E-N, T-R-U-N-S-O, I guess.  So, I'm stop, I stop working for a moment just to take in the scenery, and Ensign Trunso said, "Okay Beard, let's get to it."  Which means, get back to work.  And, when he said, let's get to it, he didn't mean, let's you and I get back to work.  What he meant was, you get back to work.  And, I asked myself, why is he telling me what to do, instead of me telling him what to do?  And, the answer is really quite simple.  He's an officer, you're not.  He has a college education and you don't.  The answer to that, is get a college education and then--that doesn't mean you don't have to take orders.  It probably means you take orders from fewer people, okay.  And, you have more options in life.  So, it was at that point that I decided, when I get out, I'm going to go to school.  So, I stayed in Roosevelt, enjoyed the time I was there, but I had no intention begin a career military type.
Story_ID: 86095
Speaker 1: And, when I got out [of the U.S. Navy] in August of '57 [sic, 1959], I went back to McDonnell Aircraft [in St. Louis, Missouri].  Because it was a defense contractor and they had to let the seniority run give you your job back.  If they don't give you your job back, they can't hire anybody else, until you're hiring, if you know what I'm talking about.  You reserve your seniority and eligibility and so forth and so on.  So, I went back to McDonnell from August until January of 1960.  That's when I started University of Missouri, okay.  In Jeff--it's not in Jeff City [Jefferson City], that's where Lincoln [University] is, but it's in Columbia [Missouri] which is the geographic middle of the state just about.  So, I decided to get an undergraduate degree and eventually go to law school.  So, that's what I did.  And, while I was in undergraduate school, I worked there to, except for the first semester.  But, after that, I worked part-time the whole time I was in college, at the Botany Lab cleaning graduated cylinders, petri dishes-- the experimental equipment that was used.  Most of the glass experiment--just cleaning it.  That's all I did.  Washed it, put it in the autoclave which is, as Doctor Kusher (ph.) would say, it's a pressurized out--glorified pressure cooker.  But it sanitizes the equipment.  And, that's what I did.  Except I think for the last year, in addition to doing that, on the weekends I cleaned up the delivery rooms in the hospital.  University of Missouri Medical Facility, it was there they needed someone to clean up the delivery rooms after women had delivered babies, and that's what I did.  The good thing about that is sometimes there were no deliveries, in which case I didn't have to do anything, but I had all night to study, okay.  So, I go to class during the day, Botany Lab clean up in the afternoon.  Friday and Saturday night University of Missouri Hospital delivery room cleaning up.
Story_ID: 86096
Speaker 1: Now, what was your major [at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri]?
Speaker 2: Political Science.
Speaker 1: Political Science.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Political Science.  That was a poli-sci major.
Speaker 1: Did you find it, you know, was it interesting to you, you know?
Speaker 2: It was interesting.  It was, it exposed me to the (laughter), for a lack of a better term, is my level of ignorance about the way (laughter) public policy functions.  I think, if you don't really pay that much attention to what goes on in congress or in city hall or in any place else, you get the impression that a lot of noble people show up and recite noble purposes and pass noble legislation.  And, lobbying and compromise are things that you don't really think about, you know, you just think everyone is of the sort of mentality of the "founding fathers," whatever that means.  And, it just--it really doesn't--public policy doesn't work that way.  But, until you really think about, you kinda get the impression that that's the way it works because of what you're exposed to, at least what I was exposed to, then.  I think people my age now--high school students are a little more sophisticated about government function, government responsibility, public interests, funding, how important, really, really, really, important money is and so forth and so on.  So, anyway, you have to understand that all of this is like in the '60s [1960s] when I'm in undergraduate school.  And, you know that the '60s [1960s]--what impact, the changes it had on the, on the way politic played out in the 60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think people, black people started to really focus more intensely on politics--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: In the 1960s with the [President John F.] Kennedy/[President Richard] Nixon election [1960]. The black community was kinda split there, they didn't--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Wasn't clear where their community was gonna go.  I think in Missouri, was it Symington or something, Stuart Symington--
Speaker 2: Stuart Symington, yes, Senator, yeah.
Speaker 1: Very active in that election--
Speaker 2: Well, and then TV played a--up until that point, TV hadn't been "of significates" with respect to, to national politics especially.  And, then they say that Kennedy won the debate as a results of a few things and TV was important.  And, you have to learn to play with the cameras and you have to learn to do a lot of things to be a successfully politian.  In addition to the things you already had to learn prior to television, okay.  So, the chemistry, the dynamics, everything you have to do now are different in pursuing public office.
Story_ID: 86097
Speaker 1: Anyway, back to--and I stayed in undergraduate school [University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri] until 1964.  Graduated '64 [1964] and started a job with the Internal Revenue [Service].  It's the summer before I graduated, so this would've been the summer of 1963.  I took what is called a grad, what was then called Graduate Record Exam.  You just take it and your name goes into a registry of people who are going to graduate who are available for jobs.  And, any government agency can tap you for a job or if you're interested and if you're available.  So, having started college in mid-academic year, in January.  I graduated in mid-academic year.  So, I think I'd been home for about two days.  I get a phone call from the Internal Revenue, 'cause they have all this data, you know.  I was in the military, and I took the exam and filled out that stuff.  And, they said, "We have a job available," the Internal Revenue, are you interested?  And, I said, "Of course.  When can I start?"  And, they said, "You can start tomorrow if you want."  (Laughter) I said, "How about Monday?"   They said, "Good enough."  So, I went down there and I started and I worked for the Internal Revenue for a while.  And, worked for a brief period with the Human Development Corporation, which is the pilot agency for the Poverty Program in St. Louis [Missouri].  Worked with a very interesting guy by the name of Harland Heath [ph.], who was a lawyer.
Story_ID: 86098
Speaker 1: And, in 1965, I moved to Washington, D.C.  And, didn't know what I wanted to do exactly, but I didn't wanna live in St. Louis [Missouri] anymore.  So,--
Speaker 2: Was there, I mean, was there any particular reason why you moved to D.C., I mean?
Speaker 1: Well, I passed through here a couple of times while I was in the [U.S.] Navy and I thought this was--probably be an interesting place to live.  And, a couple of guys who were onboard the carry--aircraft carrier with me were from D.C. and they talked about social life.  More social life than political life in D.C.  But, I found it rather interesting because even though this is the mid-Atlantic reason, culturally Washington D.C. for a long--was always a southern city, you know.  But, it was also on the east coast which was a little more socially liberal than St. Louis and a little more progressive, I guess.  And, I thought it would be interesting to live here.  I went to law school, the University of Missouri [University of Missouri School of Law in Columbia, Missouri] for a while, but I just lost the motivation.  Withdrew and then I decided to relocate and possibly pursue a legal career at some time in the future.  When I came here, I accidentally ran into a guy, who's still a very good friend, who's a salesman for IBM.  And, indicated to him that I was looking for a job.  He says, "Why don't you give my boss a call."  Gave me his card, his boss' number.  I gave him a call, had an interview and they did, you know, background, IRS, University of Missouri, to make sure that I was who I represented myself to be.  Offered me a job.  So, I started in 1965 with IBM as a salesman in the Office Products Division.
Story_ID: 86099
Speaker 1: And, I stayed with IBM from 1965 until 1973.  And, when I was working for IBM, Cary [Alfred] Booker, a good friend till this day, very good friend to this day.  His wife [Carolyn Rose] was already working for IBM as well.  As a matter of fact, he got hired through his wife, she started first.  Anyway, he introduced me to my current wife.  I say current wife, my only wife, Lillian [HM Dr. Lillian M. Beard].  And, we got married in August of '67 [1967].  So, after she got married, she was in medical school and I was working as a salesman, in law school during the day and going, I mean, a salesman for IBM during the day and going to law school [University of Baltimore School of Law in Baltimore, Maryland] at night.  And, so we were both in school and married to each other.  And, in 1970 we both graduated.  She graduated from medical school.  I graduated from law school.  And, I stayed with IBM a few more years and then I left, went with a law firm in Chevy Chase [Maryland] in 1973, stayed with them a year and then joined the Prosecutor's Office here in 1974, so.  And, then after I joined the Prosecutor's Office, I went back to law school at night and got a Masters of Law [LL.M.] from Georgetown [Georgetown University Law School in Washington, D.C.].  And, I went to law school at the University of Baltimore, so.  I keep skipping around a little bit because I keep putting these pieces in because I sometimes gloss over them.
Story_ID: 86100
Speaker 1: Of all the--now, you were in college or in, well, from the time you graduated from high school [Charles H. Sumner High School in St. Louis, Missouri], I guess, from the time you started almost there was like, civil right agitation going on in the United States and got the, you know, Montgomery Bus Boycott and all the, you know, all of [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.]'s career on television--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, you're right, it--
Speaker 1: How did you feel about all of that, at that time?
Speaker 2: That never, that never--you could argue that is hasn't stopped (laughter), you know, just sort of accelerated.  But, all these things occurred and they almost became, I won't say routine, but it struck me as sort of appropriate and necessary.  You know, Jackie Robinson, baseball, the 1954 Brown Decision [Brown v. Board of Education], the Greensboro [North Carolina] Student Boycott, the sit-ins.  That was in undergraduate school.  That happened prior, I think in 1960, '61 [1961].  The Montgomery County Bus, Montgomery County, we're in Montgomery County.  Montgomery, Alabama Bus Boycott, you know, with Rosa Parks, [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.], being a 28 year-old minister at the time.  Getting publicity not only in the black news, as it always had, but now mainstream press was covering these events.  Previously, they only recovered--they only covered race riots and so forth and so on.  But, these are events of significance, okay.  And, at that time, you had a number of other unfortunate events that seem to grab the public consciousness.  It wasn't just the Montgomery County, I mean, Montgomery, Alabama Boycotts or the, or the--you had the situation in Little Rock High School [Arkansas].  Where after the '54 [1954] Decision-[Dwight D.] Eisenhower was President at that time--question is, well now the Supreme Court has ruled, what are you gonna do about it?  Because the governor of Arkansas was Orval Faubus.  And, it was his position that Central High School in Little Rock was not going to be desegregated.  And, obviously President Eisenhower's position was, it will be, just like every other public institution, educational institution's will be.  And, to prevent, as he said, Orval Faubus, Governor Faubus said, to protect the citizens of Little Rock or the students of Little Rock--he called the National Guard--sorta like a chess game, to protect the citizens of Little Rock.  And, then President Eisenhower nationalized the National Guard, which made them Federal Troops and not under the state control of the governor.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Now,--
Speaker 2: This is, this is all going on--
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can look at all this and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, did this affect the, I mean, the high, I guess, the legal activity going on in the black community?  Higher level of legal activity, the NAACP, the Legal Defense Fund, you know, involved--
Speaker 2: I--You know, I wasn't aware of that because I can tell-
Story_ID: 86101
Speaker 1: I can address that, St. Louis [Missouri] was kind of like, it was, it was a city that made change without a--they just did things and they were done.  For example, I read somewhere, that when, when the Dodgers came to St. Louis--they use to have segregated seating--seating in Sportsman's Park.  I was never aware of it.  But, he said, "I'm not gonna play unless they desegregating the seating in Sportsman's Park."  So, they just did it, without any fan fair.  Just Okay, seating's no longer segregated.  And, growing up in St. Louis, we didn't have to sit in the back of the buses or the street cars.  But, they didn't have black streetcar or bus operators.  You just didn't, okay.  Why they didn't is something that I never thought about, because I'm a kid, you know.  And, I didn't hear it spoken about among adults, so I didn't pay that much attention to it.  But, in 1950, it's either '52 [1952] or '53 [1953], the transit authority in St. Louis hired black streetcar drivers and bus drivers.  All men at the time, okay.  But, I've seen white women operating them during the war [World War II], 'cause I was a youngster during the war.  So, we had transit operators who were women, but white women in the '40s [1940s], when the war was going on.  After the war went away, so did those jobs, for women anyway.  But, when they took on black transit operators, there was no notoriety of which I was aware.  They just showed up one day, and they start driving the buses.  And, I do remember a couple of reporters were interviewing people, says, you know, when they go off the bus.  "Say, what do you think about the bus driver?"  And, people were saying, "I don't know, what about him?"  I mean, you know, there in a--its Monday--it's a workday, you get on the bus, you drop your fare in, you go to your seat.  And, some people hadn't even paid any attention to it, at least when they were interviews.  Said, "I didn't notice him."
Speaker 2: Kinda eased up on (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Yeah, they says, wow, you know, now they go on, I didn't pay any attention.  I saw him, but I didn't make note of it, you know.  So, that is something that occurred during my early youth.  And, you say, is that a real biggie?  I don't know.  Or whom my father [Derex Beard, Sr.], remember I said he was a cab driver part-time, they had separate cab drivers unions.  Well, they desegregated the cab driver union, just like that.  Without any fanfare, they just did it.  So, you (unclear).  St. Louis was not Little Rock [Arkansas], okay.  Or, you didn't have the kinda of reaction that you did in many other cities.  They had riots in Chicago in Trumbull Park.  About what, I don't remember.  But, I do remember that they happened.  And, there was some disturbance-
Story_ID: 86102
Speaker 1: I didn't mean to--
Speaker 2: I was more interested in your motivation for becoming a lawyer, I guess, on some level or did that influence you in anyway?
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: I know there were a lot of lawyers then in [Washington] D.C. and other cities that--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Were beginning to--the Federal Government was hiring the first black lawyers.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Naw, I wasn't aware of that and that wasn't the motivating force.  But, you know, Perry Mason was very popular when I was in high school- a TV program.  But, remember when I said I was working in Mueller's grocery gtore, years ago, I'm talking when I was 14 or 15.  There was one lady her name was, I'll never forget it, her name was Miss Simpson and she used to come in the store.  She was one of the regular customers.  She said, "Young man, you should be a lawyer, because you're nice and tall."
Speaker 2: (Laughter)
Speaker 1: That's what she said.  You should be--you're nice and tall, you should be a lawyer.  And, I never forgot that, you know, I never forgot that.  I don't know what the, what the motivating force was, but I knew when I started undergraduate school [University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri] that I wanted to be a lawyer.  But, why, I can't, I can't really say.  Except, I knew it was a profession of responsibility, of respect, and I knew that you could make a difference as a lawyer.  And, perhaps the, the, the social activity in the country, and political activity at the country, in the country at the time, made a difficance, difference.  I knew who Thurgood Marshall was, okay.  And, perhaps, perhaps the profession just had a unique attraction.  I knew there's certain things I didn't want to do, but I cert-- I wasn't a career military type.  But, it just seemed to be the most attractive and I think I probably felt that I had some skill for it and that I could become a good lawyer.  So, I--that was it.  I didn't have this burning desire to be a lawyer.  But, you know, at the same time, I wanted to be a lawyer.
Story_ID: 86103
Speaker 1: Was law school [University of Baltimore School of Law in Baltimore, Maryland] a breeze for you?  Or, was it tough, or?
Speaker 2: No.  But, I did better in law school then I did in high school or grammar school.  But, you have to understand, when I was in law school I was married to a woman [HM Dr. Lillian M. Beard] who was in medical school, okay.  And, she has always been, I mean, throughout life, a serious student.  But, she's, she's goal oriented anyway, about everything she does.  You know, what she does--everything she does, she wants to do it the best possible way.  And, she is dedicated into every pursuit and I think a little bit of that rubbed off on me, you know.  When she's studying, I can't cut on the TV.  I have to study, you know.  And, I think it was a very, very positive thing for me.  It was not a breeze, but I think it was to my benefit to not only have been married, but to be married to Lillian when I was in law school, you know.  And, not only that, but I had essentially taken away all my own options.  You wanna be a lawyer, there's nothing stopping you.  A lot of things that stopped my dad [Derex Beard, Sr.] from doing a lot of things he wanted to do.  Well, the excuses were quickly melting away, you know, for people of my age.  "What do you wanna do?"  "Well, I'd love to do that, but I can't."  "Well, you can't say that anymore.  Your father could have said it, but you can't."  You wanna go to college, remember when I was out of high school, I didn't have the money.  When I got in the [U.S.] Navy, I had the money, okay.  At least to start, okay.  So, I can't say, I don't have the money.  Couldn't say, they wouldn't accept me because I'm black, the University of Missouri, because that's history, you can't say that.  You can't say they won't accept you for other reasons unless you apply, okay.  So, you apply, you get a notice of acceptance.  Well, you excuses are quickly fading away.  You don't have any fall back.  You wanna go.  Go.  You wanna be a lawyer.  Be a lawyer, okay.  And, that was the approach.  And, I think to that society was sort of changing its approach.  Like, I think, you know, like IBM didn't always have black salesmen.  But, in 1965, when I applied, I think they said, hey, why not, you know, it's time.  This is 1965 not 1865.  I'm sure that was the message that was coming across.  This is after [President John F.] Kennedy has been assassinated.  [President Lyndon B.] Johnson was President and, you know, he got a lot of publicity, a lot of notoriety about his Civil Rights Agenda, yeah. Interesting aside about when, when I came over for that first interview with IBM [in 1965], I caught a bus and their office is located in Arlington, Virginia on Fairfax Drive.  I get off the bus, and there's a building right on the corner, saying, "White men of the world unite, smash the black revolution."  It's the headquarters of the American Nazi Party, headed by George Lincoln Rockwell.  And, so I get on the bus, apply for a job and I see this.  I'm saying, you know, whoa, this is really a shocker.  It really was.  But anyway, shortly after that, he was assassinated by one of his own people.  If "assassination" is the right word.  He was killed.  Not that I rejoice in it, but this was a rather shocking thing to see, you know.  At the place where I'm applying for a job.  I not reading about this, I'm looking at it.  So, anyway, I got away from your point about, how law school being a breeze.  It was not a breeze, but I did well, yeah.
Story_ID: 86104
Speaker 1: Yeah. And, then for the first time in my like I really--life, I began to kinda like school.  And, then I go to graduate law school at Georgetown [Georgetown University School of Law], and then I begin to like it a lot!  But, it's a different environment.  Because everybody in the class is a practicing lawyer.  So, it's more, it's more collegiality.  Clearly more productive communication between the instructor and the students.  More participants than of course--
Speaker 2: Were there (simultaneously) instructor that you remember?
Speaker 1: You know, if you ask me the names--I remember Joe Greenhalgh.  I never took anything, took any courses from [William] Bill Greenhalgh, but, but, you know, unfortunately if you ask me the names, I can't remember them.  I can remember the names of the people I had in high school.  But, I can't remember the names of the people I had in law school.  But, I do remember that there was an impressive facility.  The people that--all of my instructors.  I like them, almost all of them.  Only one that I didn't particularly care for, whose name I won't mention.  (Laughter)
Speaker 2: What did they do?  I mean, what did that person do?
Speaker 1: You mean, the faculty people?
Speaker 2: The one that you did like, I mean, what--
Speaker 1: Oh, nothing.  It was, it was personality.  It had nothing to do with competence.  Just an uninteresting individual, okay.  No sense of humor, you know.  Everything was sort of a straight, straight ahead direct approach.  Whereas, many of the other people, for example, I can't remember his name, unfortunately.  But, the person who taught securities regulation was a former Chief Counsel for the Securities and Exchange Commission, okay.  Somebody with experience.  Somebody who has a rather practical exposure.  This isn't theory that he's talking about.  This is stuff that he's done, okay.  And, it's nice to have those kinds of people trying to impart what they know, to you, okay.  And, the gentlemen who taught, from whom I took Immigration Law, he is Chief Counsel for the Immigration Nationalization Service, had been, okay.  So, it made a big difference.  Their approach to teaching and our approach to learning was, was--there is a more pleasurable experience.  Plus I don't wanna yell about Georgetown, but they seems to take a genuine interest in all their students.  They wanna make sure that you do well.  They wanna make sure that you learn.  If you need help, they will get it for you.  So, I liked it.
Story_ID: 86105
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, take us through your career then that's (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, I indicated that I started with the States Attorney's Office in 1974.  Stayed there for five year, from '74 [1974] to '79 [1979].  When I was in the Prosecutor's Office, I was in the District Court for a little over a year.  The District Court is where they handle small claims, traffic court, and the less serious criminal offences, okay.  I did that for maybe a year in a half, almost two years, and then I was moved to the Circuit Court.  The Circuit Court is where all the jury trails occur.  The more serious of criminal offences, you know.  And, when I say serious criminal offences, I mean really serious, you know, murder, arson, kidnapping, burglary, those--drug offences, those kind of things.  And, after I came to the Circuit Court after about a year, I became a team leader.  So, I was essentially responsible for a number of lawyers under me, who were also prosecuting in the criminal areas.  As there were three or four teams in the office and I headed one of them.  And, I stayed there until 1979.  But, as I indicated earlier, from 1974 to '77 [1977], in addition to being a prosecutor, that's when I was at Georgetown in the evening, graduate law school.  "Seventy-nine [1979]" a vacancy occurred.  The public defender for the county, J. James McKenna, was going to devote his time, full-time to the private practice.  So, he left that office.  And, they had to appoint an attorney.  And, one of the judges, who is now in the Court of Appeals, which is our highest court.  Like in New York, our highest court is called the Court of Appeals.  In some states, its call the Supreme Court.  Name is Irma Raker, Judge Irma Raker, well she and I were in the same office and she said, "Gee, we outta give that job a look."  That's what she suggested.  And, so I applied and I was appointed by Alan Murrow [ph.], who was that time was the head of the Public Defender Service for the State of Maryland.  He appointed me, so I headed the Office of the Public Defender for Montgomery County from 1979 until 1982, okay.  And, I enjoyed the job.  I maintained a trail docket.  So, I continued to try cases in addition to being responsible for the entire office.  In 1982, I was appointed to the District Court by [Maryland] Governor Harry Hughes, who's also a lawyer.  And, and I was in the District Court from 1982 to 1984.  The District Court (excuse me), the District Court is a, what you would call a limited jurisdiction court.  In other words, there are no jury trials in the District Court.  The judge makes all the decisions, renders the verdicts--are we stopping?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah, I just wanted to make--you could finish this sentence.
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry.  Yeah, I didn't, I can pick it up, yeah.  The judge makes all of the decisions, there are no jury trials, and in the District Court, you do both Civil and Criminal Work, okay.
Story_ID: 86306
Speaker 1: The District Court, there are no jury trails, the judge makes all the decisions.  But, the, the good thing about it is, you do both Civil and Criminal cases, okay.  Because the way the dockets worked in the District Court was that you heard criminal cases on Mondays and Thursdays as a prosecutor, so that's what the judges do.  And, on Tuesday and Fridays that's when all the traffic cases were scheduled in the District Courts.  So, the District Court prosecutors would come to this Circuit Court because some of the District Court cases were moved to the Circuit Court by way of jury demand.  So, the prosecutor had to following the cases.  So, the District Court prosecutors would come to the Circuit Court and try their cases.  And, Wednesday, Wednesdays were the days that they heard civil cases in the District Court-- landlord-tenant, small claims, trespass, breach of contract, those kinds of cases, if they involved $25,000 or more.  So, having been a criminal lawyer both as a prosecutor and defense attorney, I had very little civil experience.  But, being on the District Court for a couple of years, gave me that civil experience.  Not as a lawyer but as a judge.  But, being the arena was certainly beneficial.  So, in 1974, 1984, sorry, Governor [Harry] Hughes appointed me to the Circuit Court, okay.  And, the way the law works in Maryland it's kind of peculiar, because once you're appointed to the Circuit Court, you have to stand for election in a popular election.  Which I did, along with two colleagues, Judge Peter Messitte and Judge J. James McKenna, and we were successful in 1986.  So, if you're successful in the contested election, which ours was, you automatically have the benefit of a fifteen-year term.  Which I believe is the longest in the United States for state judge.  Fifteen years, so.  But, that term expired since it was in '86 [1986], 15 years, it expired in 2001.  So, our current governor, Governor [Parris] Glendening reappointed me to an interim appointment in 2001.  And, it was in effect until 2002, which was last year.  So, last year, five judges and myself were contested in an election.  And, we all, six were successful.  So, as of November of last year, I have an additional fifteen-year term.  But, I won't be able to serve it because Maryland has a mandatory 70 year retirement age.  But, I'll serve out a portion of it.  I still have a few years to go, so.  Anyway, but I thought I'd mention that, so.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That brings us up to date--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: You know,--
Speaker 1: Um-Hum, at what I'm doing now, yes.
Story_ID: 86307
Speaker 1: Right.  And, I do a few things in addition to being a judge on this court [Sixth Judicial Circuit Court of Maryland].  Because, when I was in the Prosecutor's Office, I also taught Criminal Law and Criminal Procedure at the Graduate School of Forensic Science at a College of General Studies [sic, Columbian College of Arts and Sciences] at George Washington University [Washington, D.C.].  So, I did that.  Prosecutor in the day and instructor in the evening.  I did that for a couple of years.  And, for the last 10 or 12 years, I've been teaching at the Washington College of Law, American University in Washington, D.C.  Criminal Trial Practice in the fall semester, Civil Trail Practice in the spring semester.  So, I've been doing that for 10 or 12 years.  And, I also teach University College University of Maryland.  I teach a course to undergraduate students called Business Law.  Business Law I, Business Law II, and it covers some rather basic fields-- contracts, landlord-tenant law, wills, trusts, estates, the Uniform Commercial Code, sales, secure transactions, negotiable instruments, and that, that kind of general survey course.  And, I like it.  Teaching evenings, obviously.  Two nights a week.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, I think that is kinda current (laughter).
Story_ID: 86308
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, now what is your judicial philosophy?
Speaker 1: Actually, I don't have a philosophy being a judge that I--that differs from my philosophy about being a citizen.  I think that judges like everyone else should be responsible.  I think the public interest should always be served by public officials.  I believe people are entitled to feel that they have a reason to trust the system.  I think they should have the feeling that people actually committed to performing their jobs, whatever that may be.  But, you do it with the understanding that this is a courthouse.  It's not a theme park or an amusement park.  So, people come here a lot of times, unhappy and they leave the same way.  But, it doesn't mean they didn't get a fair trial.  And, sometimes people lose but they still feel that they, they received fair treatment.  You know, I had a guy actually one day tell me in the cafeteria, that he thought I did a good job.  And, I had, I had not ruled against him, it's just that I didn't rule in his favor.  He didn't lose, he just didn't win as much as he thought he was entitled to, at least in the courthouse.  So, I said, "Well, I hope you weren't disappointed."  He said, "It was a disappointing outcome, but I thought you did a very good job and I just wanted to let you know how I felt."  And, he wished me good luck.  Which, which sort of makes you feel good.  The guy who doesn't necessarily prevail, still doesn't take it on a personal level.  Some people do.  But, again, you do your job the best you can, and then I think the public confidence is still there.  Although there are reasons for it to wane from time to time because judges are people and we have failings too.  But, the institution, I think is alive and well.
Story_ID: 86309
Speaker 1: Now, is the population of Montgomery County [Maryland] mostly black, or?
Speaker 2: Oh no, no, I think the population of Montgomery County is a very diversified community. I think the black population probably is somewhere around 12 percent.  Hispanic, I, you know, I--probably close to 10 or 12 percent.  It may be even 12 percent.  But, people from the mid-east, you know, Pakistani, Indian, Asian community, from, you know, Korean, Vietnam.  People of African descent who are not directly or immediate American citizens or residents, but they have come from the Caribbean, some from Africa, you know, directly.  I don't even know what the statistics are.  I can only go by what I see in the courtroom and you can tell that by the composition of the juries.  When I started as a prosecutor in 1974, you didn't see anywhere near the diversity that you see now, in the jury selection process, you know, so. And, not only that, but we don't do it now, but at one time, the naturalization use to take place in the courtroom in the courthouse.  I think it's handled administratively more now with the internal, I mean the Immigration and Naturalization Service than doing it through the courthouse.  But, the Circuit Court Judges use to preside over the Naturalization Ceremonies.  And, I--
Speaker 1: People would swear allegiance?
Speaker 2: People would take the Oath of Citizenship, the Oath of Allegiance to the United States and become in fact American citizens.  It's a very moving event.  If you've ever seen it.  But, I was impressed, even before I starting doing it.  But, when I did it, it was impressive.  Because a number of speakers, sometimes it was a member of the Legislature who spoke.  Some--all the time, there was a welcoming--there were welcoming remarks by the president of our Bar Association.  And, people--spokespersons from the Daughters of the American Revolution, the American Legion, the Veteran Foreign Wars; various people would make comments and remarks at the swearing in ceremony.  As a matter of fact, one of my law clerks, former law clerks, she was from Kashmir, she's Indiana.  When she became an American citizen, I actually resided over her Naturalization Ceremony.  I didn't know it.  She told me later.  She said, "When I became a citizen, you were there."  I--The judges preside over the ceremony.  The judges don't swear them in.  An officer from the Immigration and Naturalization Service actually does the swearing in.  But, I was presiding when she became a citizen.  I didn't know that, you know, but it was, that was significant, you know, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, no, but the structure of this community [Montgomery Countym Maryland] from an ethic and racial standpoint, other than the two statistics that I gave you, and the reason I did is probably because those two are reported with greater frequency.  Because everyone's aware of the increasing percentage of the Hispanics, the growing Hispanics community.  And, for some reason, you just see those numbers with greater frequency.  But, I think from every, every group, ethnic or otherwise, racial, the numbers are becoming more diverse.  The general population of the Metropolitan [Washington] D.C. area is growing anyway.  When I came to this county in--my wife [HM Dr. Lillian M. Beard] and I moved to Montgomery County, I think in '69 [1969], the population, I think was probably around 600,000 and now it's close to a million, okay.  And it will exceed a million in the near future, you know, in the whole Metropolitan D.C. area.
Story_ID: 86310
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any particularly interesting cases that you can talk about, that, you know, in general terms?
Speaker 2: Some are significant from a legal standpoint and some are not, I would say, they're not legally significant but they got a lot of notoriety, okay.  From a legal standpoint, I can think of probably two within the last couple of years.  Most people haven't even heard of them, but one involved the concept of spousal privilege.  In other words, any communication between spouses cannot be use in a court of law, against one of them.  Obviously, in a divorced case what they say to each other, because they're both parties, that's an adversarial situation.  But, in a criminal prosecution, you can't use communications between spouses as part of the prosecutor's evidence.  Well, this case involved physical abuse and assault, serious assault.  The husband was charged with, with assaulting his wife to the point of hospitalization and so forth and so on.  Prior to the event, they'd been living in the same house.  But, essentially occupying separate bedrooms and only using common facilities like the kitchen and so forth and so on.  Something happened, he beat her up rather badly.  He was criminally prosecuted for it and she testified against him.  A spouse, again, is not a compellable witness.  She couldn't have been made by the court or the prosecutor to testify against her husband, but she wanted to testify against him.  So, there was no way of preventing that.  That is, he could not have prevented it.  But, during the period of time between the event and the trial, he had actually called her on the telephone.  And, what he said was, he was sorry that he had beaten her up.  He apologized and that he regretted his conduct and he wanted her to take him back.  And, her response was, don't call me again.  I'll see you in court.  Which she did.  But, when her testimony was offered, her lawyer attempted to get in that apology, I mean, not her lawyer, the prosecutor wanted to get in the apology over the telephone, which is sort of like an admission or declaration against one's punitive interest, when he says that.  Anytime, you apologize for doing something, it's essential the same as admitting it.  Right.  I'm sorry I stole the cookies, you know, and that kind of thing.  So, anyway, the defense lawyer said, this is a privileged communication between a husband and wife.  It cannot be used.  The prosecutor's position was, the whole purpose of the privilege with respect to marital communications is to save the marriage.  Judge, this wasn't a marriage (laughter).  They were--they were just sharing a house, they were legally connected to each other, but for all practical purposes.  Substantively, this was not a marriage.  There's nothing to protect.  It would be engaging in the practice of futility to exclude this.  Besides, here's a statement, but it falls within an exception which makes it admissible called the declaration against one's punitive interest.  So, I bought that argument.  I allowed it in.  And, he was convicted.  An appeal was filed.  And, it ultimately went up to our highest court, The Court of Appeals.  And they said, you know, essentially the privileged communications, privileged communications of the concept of privileged communications between a husband and wife, irrespective of the way the relationship is functioning, it's sacrosanct.  And, until the legislature changes it, it remains live and well in this state.  It was inappropriate to allow it.  The conviction is reversed and it was sent back.  That got, a little publicity.  Whether it was right or wrong, I don't know.  But, this is the way the court system functions.  And, this is what trail judges do, you know.  Was the guy safe or was he out.  You have to call 'em, you know.  There's no video tape in the courtroom.  Well, you use to be able to say there's no videotape in the courtroom.  I'm not sure you can say that anymore.  But, but the point is, when you have to make the decision, you have to make it then and there, okay.  And, there may be some reason, a good reason, for making it, but sometimes there's no option.  There are no (unclear) options, it's either is or it isn't.  He's either safe or he's out.  It's either a ball or a strike, okay.  And, you either let the evidence in or you exclude it, okay.  And, the Appellate Courts have to review it and determine the propriety of it, okay.  And, that was sort of socially significant.
Story_ID: 86311
Speaker 1: There have been others that-- it's difficult to sort of reflect back on and say which ones were the most important, which ones got the most publicity.  There was one case that I presided over, it involved a double murder.  A friend killing two friends, who were married to each other-- a husband and wife.  Got a lot of publicity but in terms of legal significance, I don't mean to be crass, but it was just another double murder, you know.  There no great legal statements that come out of it, but it certainly got a lot of publicity as a kind of case like that does.  But, in terms of legal principals, I can't think of too many under this circumstance.  I'm sure, because I keep copies of all my opinions, if I went back and sort of thumb through them, I would come up with those that are legally significant.  There was one that I think was of legal significance.  It didn't get any publicity, but what it involved was the question of an entitlement to a jury trial in a landlord-tenant case.  This particular case was one which the tenant was to be removed from the premises by the landlord because of some alleged violation of the lease agreement.  The landlord did not want the back rent.  So, he wasn't requesting money.  All he wanted was possession.  When I say he, I'm talking about an institution not an individual.  Just wanted his property back without the tenant.  So, he went to landlord-tenant court and there was a request for a jury demand.  And, for a jury demand to be met, in other words, for there to be an entitlement to a jury trial, certain criteria has to be met, okay.  So, it was my determination, and it's a financial, its monetary criteria, since the landlord only wanted possession and he didn't want any money.  The monetary criteria, and there was no countersuit, the monetary criteria had not been met.  Consequently, no entitled to the jury trail.  Sent it back to District Court for disposition.  Well, my ruling in that connection was appealed and then it went up to the highest court, The Court of Appeals.  And, basically what they determined in that particular case, it was rather lengthy, that even though monetary relief is not sought by the moving party, the tenant has a right to a jury trial.  If the tenant can establish that the value of the tenancy meets the monetary bright line to qualify for a jury trial.  And, the reason I ruled the way I did was because I felt that the landlord-tenant jurisdiction in the District Court was designed to bring about rather expedient resolutions of these landlord-tenant issues.  And, when you get to the point where you're having very lengthy trails about the value of, monetary value of the tenant's interest, when money is not being sought in the case sort of slows down the process.  Which is contrary to the expediency that clearly was supposed to result from having it in the District Court anyway.  So, they reversed me on that and sent it back.  And, said that the tenant's entitled to show the monetary value alleged on the bases of the tenancy by comparing with comparable housing in the same neighborhood at the time.  And, I thought, this is cumbersome and it's erroneous.  But, the, but with the Court of Appeals, they're not necessarily, what's that expression, "they're not the court of last resort, because their right.  They're right because they are the court of last resort," if you know what I mean.  So, that's the law and that's the way it is.  But, legally that's significant, but in terms of publicity, this, if at all, so.  But, it's interesting, so.  But, in terms of cases that have gotten a lot of publicity or popular or most challenging, it's hard to think of them.
Story_ID: 86312
Speaker 1: Okay.  We always ask people this and you've seen a lot as a judge, what are your, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community?
Speaker 2: Generally, or just as it relates to the legal system?
Speaker 1: Well, generally, you know.
Speaker 2: I actually, they don't differ now than what they were when I became "social conscious," whenever that was, you know, 16, 18.  But, I do believe that realistic, realistic avenues are express, of expression do exist.  But, you have to take advantage of them and it means changing attitudes, you know like I say, like I wasn't thinking about going to college when I finished high school.  But, something happened that made me realize that maybe you should think about it.  And, when I thought about it, I was in a position to act on it.  What's unfortunate is if you don't made decisions, society makes them for you by default.  In other words, if you choose not to pursue and undergraduate education, that's okay.  But, if you looking for a job, the person who is giving out the jobs, or who's hiring people, has to make personnel choices.  He has to hire people and not hire people and credentials of whatever nature make a difference.  If he has to choose between, say-- I'll give you an example, say a fast food, a manager of a fast food restaurant is hiring people.  And, all he wants somebody to do is a menial job, flipping burgers, I think is the, is the probably the expression, yeah, flip burgers.  He said, I have to hire somebody to flip burgers, okay.  Three people apply, one guy dropped out of high school, one is in high school, and one is a college student who wants a part-time job, okay.  All things being equal, the changes are, he's gonna go with the college part-time student, okay.  Why?  It's a motivated individual.  It's somebody who's in college who wants to work, okay.  Now, that person says, no I don't want the job, I got another job instead.  Then, he has the other person who's a high school graduate.  He will probably be his back-up choice.  Why?  'Cause, his is a person who finishes what he starts.  At the very least, he finished high school, okay.  Now, out of the three, the guy who dropped out of high school is the third choice.  All of them could probably flip the burgers with equal facility.  That's not the point.  The guy who's giving out the jobs has to hire somebody to do the job and he is going to hire the person who's most beneficial to him and who can help him to most.  So, you have to position yourself to be valuable to someone and at the same time, be valuable to yourself.  And, that really centers around education and that's what the--my teachers were telling me in grammar school.  That's what people have always told me.  And, that's what people tell everybody.  That what everybody tells everybody else.  "Go to school and do well."
Story_ID: 86313
Speaker 1: As a matter of fact, this is somewhat of an aside, but I think is significant.  We [the Sixth Judicial Circuit Court of Maryland] do the adoptions too.  People, you know, the adoption process; their evaluations, their interviews, their papers to be filled out, certain criteria, sometimes it involve immigration issues sometimes it doesn't.  But, children who are adopted range from six weeks, you know, to sixteen years of age.  But, if a child is old enough to understand the language that we all use, you know, English.  I always tell them after the adoptions ceremony is included, good luck, make good grades.  That's the last thing I say.  Make good grades.  Now, I'm sure most of the kids have heard it from their parents and there gonna hear it from other people.  But, that is significant.  It is very, very important and to pursue, even if you don't wanna pursue academic excellence, pursue academic completion, okay.  If you get a Ph.D., nobody's gonna say, were--did you get the lowest grade point average among the Ph.D.'s?  That's a questions that you don't really have to worry about as a general proposition, okay.  And, the point is, if you don't excel, completion is the next best thing, okay.  And, and when you don't fulfil any task, it burdens you, it really does.  And, your life choices are made by someone else.  And, you can't make your own life choices.  You know, which college you go to is academic if you don't graduate from high school.  So, that's a decision that you won't have to make, okay.  'Cause somebody else has made it for you.  The Admission's Committee, okay.  So, make your own decision.  You wanna go to college, finish high school first.  And, with good grades, you get--open--your choice of colleges, okay.  So, the point is, don't lose hope in yourself and if you don't lose hope in yourself, you probably won't lose hope in this society, because it's a competitive world.  It's becoming increasingly competitive.  And, that was the message I always got and was true then, okay.  But, it was true and harsh.  Now, it's still true but less harsh, you know.  There may be a job where somebody only needs one Ph.D., okay.  So, (laughter) you know, things like that happen.  I only need one so-and-so.  Just think of all the people who wanna be astronauts.  I don't know what the number is, but it is substantial.  And, a lot of qualified good people are going to be rejected.  I have to do this once a year.  I have to pick a law clerk.  All the Circuit Court judges get one law clerk, okay.  And, I have people with superb credentials, men and women, various backgrounds, very diverse, you know, 150 applications.  And, out of that 150 applications I get, probably, probably, 75 percent of those applicants could do that job to my satisfaction.  But, I only get to pick one, okay.  It's a matter of selection, not rejection.  But, functionally it is rejection, okay.  But, they have the option.  Move on to something else, okay.  And, eventually, they, you know, they land on their feet.  I assume, because I see a lot of people that I didn't hire, but who do very well.  It doesn't have anything to do with qualifications.  It has to do with how many doors, how many windows exist.  There was a young lady, I went to the Women's Bar Associations Luncheon, two days ago.  And, they have this--it used to be take your daughter to lunch, now it's take your child to lunch.  But, they always have professional people speak to these young high school people.  And, one of the speakers was Glenn Ivey, who was the States Attorney for Prince George's County, who is a Princeton [University in Princeton, New Jersey] undergraduate, Harvard Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts], a credentialed man.  He spoke to the group.  But, [Jacqueline] Wendy Thompson [Thompson-Marquez] was an immigrant.  She came to this country when she was twenty-one years of age.  Didn't speak any English and had been working only as a nanny prior to that.  Years passed.  But, now she's a General Manager of Telemundo, the Hispanic station.  Her point was, there's a difference between failing and failure.  What's the difference?  And, this is what she posed to these children.  And, she got various answers.  But, one person hit it right on the head.  And, it's a question of attitude.  One is temporary and one is permanent.  She says, because everybody who tries, fails, okay.  But, if you give up you're a failure.  If you don't give up and you keep trying, you will succeed, trust me, okay.  And, that message took.  But, you know, this again, she's preaching to the choir.  These kids were all motivate anyway.  But, the point is even those of us who are motivated, even those of us who have talent, you still need somebody to slap you in the back every now and then to keep, keep going.  Because, you will fail from time to time at something and it'll be disappointing.  But, that message, I think, it applies-- has universal application.  And, I think the black community, however we can do it, let's see, keep pushing, keep trying.  The bar is continuously being raised.  Just meet the raisings.  Be qualified, keep bumping, keep bumping, keep trying.  One of the things that Wendy said when she was applying for the job, she called every day for three months.  Every day for three months.  "How am I looking?"  "Can I get you any more about myself?"  "You need more references" (unclear) every day.  Finally, they called her and said hey, hey, everybody else fell out (laughter) and quit, you didn't.  You got the job, okay.  Yeah, so, it's kinda marvelous.

Speaker 1: At this stage, I know you're still working.  You're not ready to retire quite yet--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You got about another seven more years?
Speaker 2: Naw, not that long.  I'm 65.  You have to retire at 70.
Speaker 1: Alright.  What would you see at this point, as your legacy?
Speaker 2: Aww, man (laughter).  My legacy?  I don't even know if, I don't know, I don't know.  I--if, if there would be a legacy, I'm a guy who was lucky enough to have a lot of people in his corner.  My parents [Derex Beard, Sr. and Gladys Cook Beard], my brothers, my sister, a lot of friends, people who just given me, you know, breaks.  You know, Alan Murrow [ph.], didn't have to hire me to head the Public Defender's Office.  [Andrew] Andy Sonner didn't have to hire me to be a prosecutor, you know.  Bill Mann didn't have to hire me with his law firm.  Even when I was working in undergraduate school [University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri] during the summer, because I didn't come home during the summers.  I stayed there and all I did was move furniture around the Housing Department.  I mean, the guy was in charge of the Housing, is Dr. Callaghan [ph.], but his assistant was a guy by the name of Howard Husky [ph.].  Got a lot of jobs who wanna--a lot of guys who wanna move furniture around, but he gave me the job.  Why?  I don't know.  He just did.  But, it makes a difference.  Little favors, little favors, things that keep you upright.  Sorta like a boxing mount, you know what I mean?  The bell rings, you sit down, somebody throws water in your face (laughter) and they rub you down a little bit.  And, the bell rings and you got people to push you back in there.  We all need the guys who can push us back into the ring again, yeah.  Even though you don't asked to be pushed back, boom.  And, even though you may not need a push.  To know if you need it, you have friends who will give you that push if they feel you need it.  Even if you don't ask for it.  That has a sort of supportive, supportive effect, you know.  So, my legacy is, I was fortunate enough to have a lot of good friends and relatives who were in my corner.
Story_ID: 85843
Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Separate and apart about what I just said.  I didn't make a distinction between legacy.  I think, you know, when I was a lawyer, I--it meant a lot to me to be known as just as a good lawyer.  I didn't need, you know to be, you know, I didn't need that greatest lawyer in the United States, or anything like that.  Just a good lawyer.  A guy who did his job.  A blue collar lawyer, sort of speak.  I mean, that may not seem a lofty goal.  But, you know, I take the job seriously, and I'd just like to be, you know, known as a guy who's a good judge.  He did his best.  And, I enjoyed what I did.  I enjoyed being a lawyer.  I really, really, enjoyed being a lawyer.  And, I think I enjoy being a judge.  And, I think the reason is that I was a lawyer and am a judge here in Montgomery County [Maryland].  And, if you're going to be a lawyer or a judge, I don't think there's a better place to be either, than here in Montgomery County.  Because, the courthouse staff has always been very supportive.  I don't mean in a personal way.  You know, help me because I'm me.  I--They just help people.  Very bright, very cooperative, very helpful, very informed, very flexible, very knowledgeable, very everything.  So, it's a pleasure to work in this environment.  My colleagues were all super lawyers when they were lawyers and they're all terrific as judges, past and present.  Some of them have unfortunately passed away recently, but a number have retired.  And, when I came to this County, you know, decades ago, as a lawyer, as a young lawyer, older than many lawyers, but nevertheless still younger than I am now, I was always treated by the judges and the courthouse personnel, very appropriate, professional, professional manner.  So when I sought to become a judge, I had a lot of support from some of the judges who had retired, you know.  Again, that goes back to what I said a moment ago about people who just sort of like, give you support, in your corner, and helping.  So, I--just to be known as a good judge.  A good judge.  That means a lot to me.
Speaker 1: Alright, well thank you.
Speaker 2: My pleasure.  Thank you so much.  I appreciate it.

Speaker 1: Okay.  So, just give us a brief description of who's in the photo you know, in this case, go from left to right, maybe bottom row first, left to right.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Always go left to right, like we read.
Speaker 2: Oh, Okay.  Very Good.  Okay.  On the lower left, my mom, Gladys [Cook] Beard, and next moving to the right, is my sister, Paula Beard, Smith now, she's married.  And, further to the right, my dad, Derex Beard, Sr.  And, next to my dad is my brother, Paul Beard.  And, he and Paula are twins.  They were born January of 1956, but 10 days before my high school graduation, okay.  In the second row is my brother, Derex Beard, Jr., and in the middle is Otis Charles, who is next to me in age.  And, then I'm on the far right.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  What year do you think this was taken?
Speaker 2: Oh, was taken in the spring of 1964, right after I graduated from undergraduate school [University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri].  Because, I was going to have a picture of myself made for my parents.  So, I went down to this studio because at that time, I don't know if they still do it, but when you graduate from college, the insurance people, the car dealers, the petroleum card, I mean, Texaco, Gulf, they send you--'cause they figure, this guy is going to go out and buy a car.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  That's right, yeah.  They're all over you.
Speaker 2: Everybody's sending you everything, you know.  (Laughter) so, I said, "I'll have a picture made of my--of me for my mom and dad.  So, I went down there and I sat for that picture, and I gave it to them.  And they said, "This is really nice."  But, when I was down there, the lady said, "Why don't you have a family picture made?"  And, I said, "I don't have the money for that."  And, she said, "It's not that expensive.  It's not as expensive as you think it is."
Speaker 1: My brother took it to Kinko's.  He took the original out of the frame, took it to Kinko's and said, "Run off about eight copies of this."  So, that family photo is really a copy from Kinko's of the family portrait.

Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Alright, go ahead.
Speaker 2: This is my mother's father, Sterling.  Sterling Cook.  And, I don't know where he was when this picture was taken because, when he passed away in the '40s [1940s], he was living in Chicago [Illinois].  So, I don't know if this was taken when he was in Chicago or this was taken in Arkansas before he moved to Chicago.
