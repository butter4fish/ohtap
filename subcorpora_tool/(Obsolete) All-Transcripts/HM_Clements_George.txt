Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you about your mother. And if you could give her name and talk about what you know about her background.
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Aldonia "A-L-D-O-N-I-A" Peters "P-E-T-E-R-S" Clements. And my mother had, as I guess most humans could say, the most vivid impact on my life.  My mother was born in a place called (pho.) Opelika, Alabama. And she was a--an extremely brave person. She took chances.  She came to Chicago after having had a very unfortunate marriage to a man who became an alcoholic. And she came to Chicago with two small babies--two children. And she came here--she came to Chicago, met my father in Chicago and they got married. And its interesting. I told you about those two babies she came with. I grew up thinking that they were my biological brother and sister and not finding out until I was twelve years old--thirteen years old that they weren't. Because my father he treated them just as though they belonged to him.  I was very fortunate with both my mother and my father in that they were both people that really were good parents. They really nurtured me and my siblings. And my mother, in particular, was a real housewife.  She really nurtured her children. And I was very blessed with her love. And she was with me up until her death at the age of thirty-six.  And something interesting happened about a year before she died. She fell down the stairs in her home. And the doctors said that she had to go into a nursing home.  So we had a conference in the family. We all agreed okay. And I went to the nursing home to get her--I went to the hospital to get her to take her to the nursing home. And on the way there I said, "Nah, I'm not taking my mother to no nursing home." So I took her to the rectory where I was. And I put up a bed right beside my bed. And I said, "Ok mother--." 'Cause we always joked. I said, "Now, you know, you're gonna have to pay me some rent." She said, "Oh that's no problem. Just deduct it from all that free rent you had when you were living with me (laughs)."  So she actually lived for almost a year after that. And I am convinced that the reason she lived that long is because she was there with me. Because I knew once my mother got in a nursing home she would have said, "Well they're putting me here to die."  And I'm just so happy that she was with me that last year of her life.
Speaker 1: So that was a good thing. And she even had her sense of humor at that time.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh yeah. Oh that last year was incredible.  Because people--I was at Holy Angels, a big parish in Chicago. And you know parishioners were always coming to see her. And my mother would be lying there saying, "Ahhhh." And I'd say, "Mother, Mrs. Jones is here. She wants to see you." "Oh, no, no I can't see anybody.  Wait a minute." And then she'd start doing her hair. And then the lady would come. She'd, "How are you?", she was a great actress (laughing).
Speaker 1: That's adorable.  When you think of yourself and you think of your mother, what attributes did you get from her?
Speaker 2: The one that stands out the most is my mothers concern for whoever was not being attended to.  For example, we were always having groups at our home.  It was just our house was the place where people just gravitated. And there were always parties and everything.  And my mother inevitably  she would be in there entertaining and all that. And then she would spot somebody over in the corner that nobody was talking to. That's the person she'd go over to and say, "Now come on. Have you had something to eat? And have you met so and so?" And all that and she would insist that everybody become involved.  And this was done from the time we were small children. Because there was always some child, in the neighborhood, who parents had maybe gone south or whatever. Some child that was dangling.  She'd always bring the children to our home.  People came up from the South.  She'd always make what they call a pallet. And she'd say, "Now you just lie here until times get better." And all that.  She was always insistent on us taking in others.  Well that carried on to my life. Because later on in life, unbeknownst to me, here I am a catholic priest. And I just decided when I couldn't get people in my own parish interested in adoption and I said, "Okay If you won't do it, I will." And I was the first priest to ever adopt.  And it dawned on me later on, much later, that this the seeds for this were sown by my mother and my father. Because this was just something that they did. And nobody gave you a metal for it or a plaque or an award or anything else. That's just something that they taught us.
Speaker 1: Did she--do you remember her sharing with you anything about her growing up that sort of stuck with you?
Speaker 2: Yes--She told me that she as a child, she had many sis--She had eight sisters and one brother. And she told me about how, as a child, her parents insisted on those girls learning how to take care of themselves.  Her father died at a relatively early age. And so they were taught how to sew, how to cook and all that. And they were taught this independence. And they had a strong feeling of how important they were as women--As females. And this is long before the liberation boom had came along.  And so later on after I told you about that failed marriage, she took those kids and she got on that train and came up to Chicago, because she had been taught that as a child. That, you know, you just got yourself together and did it on your own. And you did not look to the government to do it for you, you did it yourself.  And that, of course, was coupled with my father's attitude too. Because my father was strongly independent. And he just insisted he didn't want any government handout.  At that time they called it charity. And he didn't want no charity, no relief or anything else. And he bragged about how his family--he took care of his family.
Speaker 1: Now did she know--just one other question about your mother. Did she know much about her family background or anything.
Speaker 2: Yes, she did.  And she was insistent that we would know.  We--I--we had to know all of her sisters, even those who had died and her brother.  She insisted on telling us about her mother who was partially an Indian.  Partial Indian. Whatever you called it. Yeah, Cherokee I think.  And her father who was half white and she insisted that as children we would go down to Alabama where she lived and meet all of these people that she grew up with. Because she wanted us to have strong ties to her family.  So I, you know, was with Aunt Slap and Aunt Nunnie and Aunt Martha and Inez and all of these people--Uncle Nez and all--we knew all of them because she insisted on that. But to be fair, she also insisted that we know, she and my father, that we would know his side of the family too.
Story_ID: 17166
Speaker 1: Talk about your father. His name--.
Speaker 2: His name was Samuel Clements. And he is the reason why we are Catholics. Because there are only three areas in the nation that were--in the South, that there were heavily Catholic. That's New Orleans, Baltimore and Bardstown, Kentucky--Louisville, Kentucky. And he was born there is a placed called Lebanon. And there both whites and blacks were Catholics. You know, the blacks, of course, had been slaves on those plantations and they took the religion of their slave-owners.  And so my father was a rather quiet man. Somewhat, I guess, somewhat shy in a way. But very independent guy. Went into this-the  First World War, came out and came to Chicago. Met my mother there and that's how we got here.
Speaker 1: Now did he talk at all about his growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes. He used to talk about his mother and father quite a bit. About his two sisters and again, as children, we were sent down to his--to Kentucky where he grew up. So that we could know my cousins and know where he grew up and meet all these people who were on his side of the family. And we got involved down there too with what they called a homecoming. Once a year they all would come together and have these big family reunions and so forth. And my father wasn't as adamant about this as my mother was. My mother did something really interesting. I know you're talking about my father now. But I just wanna throw this in.  The week after they got married, she got on the train and went down to Kentucky-- had never been to Kentucky in her life. Went to his mother and started bonding with his mother. Spent a whole week there meeting his two sisters and all that. And became his mother's daughter. Then came back to Chicago, started raising us.  And whenever she and my father would have any kind of an argument, she'd always "Well I'm just gonna tell your mother. That's all." And got all in with his mother and named us after his side of the family.  Like after his mother and his father--I'm named after my grandfather on my father's side.  My--but my father wasn't into that family stuff nearly as much as she was.  She's the one who insisted that we go down as nine, ten, eleven years old, get on the train.  We'd all go down in summer--in the summers.  Spend the summers  down there with my grandmother.  One year we'd spend with--on his side, one year on her side. And this carried on up until we were in our teens.
Speaker 1: Did he know much about his slave heritage at all? And are you saying he was born in 18--.
Speaker 2: He did.  He knew about it, but he would not talk about it.  My father was not into politics or any of that. And I often thought back on that and realized that its because it was such a dreadful part of his background. And he just would not get into it.  I got a taste of it when we were about, oh gosh, I guess around sixteen, seventeen years old. And my sister came home with a white guy from school. And my father was really a mild mannered person. And after they--when they left, he called my sister and he says, "Don't you ever in your life do that again. Ever." And, you know, my mother was, "Samuel, why you--?" He said, "Those are the people who raped us. And I will not have them. I will not you understand?"  Oh he was so adamant on that. And that was so unlike my father. 'Cause my father was really a nice, nice guy. But he--When he did talk we listened. It wasn't often that he did. But when he did it took effect.
Speaker 1: Now the other thing. Well I wanna ask one question before I ask another question. Did he talk any about--I know he wasn't the most talkative about his growing up. Anything-and how--.
Speaker 2: Well he talked about the church. His mother, about how wrong it was for blacks to have to sit in the back of the catholic church there. And about how this one priest got up one Sunday and said, "God doesn't want this." And he said to the blacks, "Come on up here where you belong." And that the whites all--got all angry and upset about it. And that how right after that, they transferred this priest. And then the blacks settled back into the back again. But he said that, that priest was ahead of his time. You know. He talked about stuff like that. He talked about Gethsemane, a Trappist monastery down there. And how he had a friend, a boyhood friend, who they used to play all the time together, Vincent Smith. And he said, "Vincent was like a little thug. A juvenile delinquent." And my father talked about how he would sneak a cigarette and all that as they were like, I guess, ten or eleven years old. Anyway, low and behold Vincent Smith becomes a Trappist monk himself. And my father used to laugh about that all the time happy. He'd say, "Of all people who would ever thought Vincent would become the first black Trappist  in America." 'Cause when they used to, as kids, play and they would, you know, see this place that was forbidding and all that. And then, you know, he--But he-Yeah he had a lot of stories he would tell us about his childhood.
Speaker 1: Now how did he get to Chicago? What year did he come?
Speaker 2: He came to Chicago after the first World War, after he got out of the army. So I think he came to Chicago about the '20s [1920s],  late '20s [1920s] somewhere in there.
Speaker 1: Do you know how your parents met?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  There was a dance and he spotted my mother. And he went over and started, you know, trying to talk to her. And my mother said that he was so shy that she started laughing (laughing). And so that's, that's how they met. And eventually one thing led to another.
Speaker 1: Now the thing that sort of caught my attention was your talking about the places in the country where, you know, Louisiana, Kentucky and--.
Speaker 2: Well the three places in the south were Baltimore, Louisiana and Kentucky.
Speaker 1: Why those places--?
Speaker 2: Because that's where the people from Europe who were Catholic, that's where they settled. The French and--primarily the French--.
Speaker 1: French and the Creoles.
Speaker 2: And the Creoles and so forth. And then a lot of the people who had first settled in Baltimore, drifted over to Kentucky and settled there. That was how that happened.
Speaker 1: But those were also French or were they of another--?
Speaker 2: Irish.
Speaker 1: Irish.
Speaker 2: Irish and French.
Speaker 1: Oh okay, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  And, of course, blacks are primarily protestant because they're slave owners were Baptist and Methodist. And there were relatively few Catholics that settled in the south.
Speaker 1: Is there any, historically, is there any study or do you have any comment about how black Catholics were treated as opposed to--I mean or black--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The slaves of black Catholics were treated opposed to Protestants?
Speaker 2: There's a book called 'Slave and Citizen' ['Slave and Citizen:The Negro in the Americas'] by [Frank] Tannenbaum and he goes into that intensively. There was definitely a different treatment. Because unlike the Baptist religion, the Methodist and so forth, Catholics were forbidden by their religion to discriminate 'cause the word Catholic itself means universal. It means for all people spreading, you know, that it isn't for any one particular group, but Catholic meaning univer--meaning, you know, for everybody. So Catholic's in discrimination were--in discriminating, I should say, were actually breaking the laws of their religion. And you remember I told you the story about that priest who was ahead of his time down there in Lebanon, Kentucky. He pointed that out to these people that, according to our religion, you can't do this. You're sinning when you discriminate. Now that's not true of the other non-Catholic religion, non-Catholic Christian religions. And so, Catholics always had a problem doing this without guilt. And that's why even in countries like Brazil or Cuba and places like that where they were primarily Catholics, there was always a lot of intermarriage or interrelationships. And even in Louisiana. You know, there are a lot of whites and blacks that got together. Because actually that--our religion teaches that people are not supposed to do that. You know the teaching and the practice are two different things.
Speaker 1: Now did your parents, did they ever talk about missing the South? 'Cause I'm thinking they're both from small places.
Speaker 2: No. No.
Speaker 1: Did they, were they--.
Speaker 2: There was no nostalgia about going back or anything else. They wanted us to know about it. There's a little incident that happened when I announced I was gonna become a priest. I was thirteen years old. And they said, "Well how are you gonna do this?" And I told them about this seminary that I knew in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. And it was a seminary for--the only seminary in America for blacks and my father looked at me like I was crazy. He said, "I'm not sending you down in some segregated seminary. No, no. You can't go." And not too long after that we were told about a seminary in Chicago called Quigley, and I went there.
Story_ID: 17167
Speaker 1: What is your youngest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: My youngest memory is that when I was 4 1/2, almost 5 years old and I had a little sister two years younger than myself and she died of tuberculosis. And they, for some reason, had her funeral in our house in the apartment that we lived in. And I remember being back in the apartment and one of my uncles came to me and said, "Your sister, little Odessa, is sleeping." And I remember so well looking at him and saying, "Uncle she is dead. She is not sleeping." I remember that so vividly.
Speaker 1: (Laughs). Oh boy you were unbelievable. That caused some discussion that statement (laughs).  Don't you think that statement--that's a pretty, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Well what I, of course, meant is that she's not coming back and I know that. You know.
Speaker 1: Now with--lets--where did your family live in Chicago--?
Speaker 2: Okay. When I was a small child we lived at 552 East 51st Street. Right across from Washington Park. When I was about ten, we moved to 601 East 50th Street, on the corner of 50th and St. Lawrence. And then when I was in the seminary and I was about nineteen, they moved to 6436 Carpenter. And then when I had been a priest, I think, I think it was 1958 or 1959, that's when they moved to 9615 Wallace. And they lived there up until they died.
Speaker 1: Father Clements, can you describe--well give me your names of your siblings in birth order. But I'd like you to describe--.
Speaker 2: My siblings in order were Julia, my oldest sister. And I told you the story about how I didn't even know until I was going into the seminary that they weren't my full brother and sister. And Julia was the role model. She was--she always did everything right. She was the one who went to the opera. And she was the one who talked about us raising our level all the time. She was always doing things the proper way. She spoke very distinctly and she dressed right and everything was always right. Then my brother John. And he was not really that involved in our lives, as we were small children. Not anything like Julia. He was more just playing and going to school in high school himself and all that.  He was alright. But I never--and then he'd joined the Marines. And so he was gone quite a bit. And then my sister Ida, who was one year older than myself. And we kind of grew up together and she was rather temperamental person. I loved her, but I never really was that close to her, really (unclear). We just didn't really do a lot of things together. Then my two younger ones, Larry who is like about seven years younger then myself, eight years. And he was my little brother. And I really didn't get to know him all that well because I went into the seminary as he was growing up. And then my little sister Inez and I was closer to her than I was probably to any of my siblings. And she and I have remained very close up to this time.
Speaker 1: So talk--give me some stories just about growing up in the house. And I'd like you to take me back to your early, you know, early years--just give me a story you know about growing up. Just (unclear). But anyway, if you could give me a couple stories.
Speaker 2: Growing up, I was very involved with my grammar school, Corpus Christi and with the nuns there and the priests. And I was fascinated with that whole aura of being in that school. And being very attached to the students too, and to be thought of well by the students. I wasn't a very tough guy. But I knew my survival depended on the tough guys. So I would make friends with all the guys who were bad. And, for example, I used to take our homework. And I would--we had carbon paper. And I would make carbons and I would give it to them the next day. And, you know, they didn't have to do homework. They could always get George to do their homework. And so  you'd better not mess with George. You know. And they called me "Professor", that was my nickname. 'Cause I was the brightest student in the class. And I dreaded anybody thinking that I was not part of the crowd. You know, I wanted to walk hip and talk hip and all that stuff. But, you know, I didn't want in any kind of way to stick out like a sore thumb. And this lasted really all the way through eighth grade. I wanted to be normal. To me the worst thing would have been for somebody to think I was a nerd. We didn't use that term, but that's what it would have been at that time. You know I just wanted to be part of the crowd. And sometimes I'd come home and I would sort of act like some of those guys. And Julia would always raise her eyebrows. And then I'd get back into acting the way I was supposed to act.
Story_ID: 17168
Speaker 1: When I joined the seminary I was thirteen years old. And shortly after joining it, the guys in the neighborhood were puzzled. They didn't know what seminary was. "What are you talking about?" And I started explaining to them some of the rules and regulations. And they said, "Now lets get this straight. You don't smoke, you don't drink and you don't get anything with the girls or nothing. Well what do you do?"  And--'cause they just--that was beyond their (unclear). That somebody would be going to an all white school and studying to be a priest. That was just something that they couldn't figure at all. And I lived--the area that I lived in was know familiarly as the valley. And that was an area from Calumet to Champlain and then from 47th to 51st. And it was a tough neighborhood. And it was--I don't know if I would characterize it at that time, we were talking about the '40s [1940s], '50s [1950s]--I wouldn't characterize it as a slum. But I certainly would say it was a deprived area.
Speaker 2: If you would take yourself back to that time and the area, can you sort of recall any sights, smells or sounds that remind you of growing up?
Speaker 1: Yes. I can recall vividly a little guy who used to go around singing "Everybody wants to go to heaven. Nobody wants to die." And it turned out that that man was Elijah Muhammad. I remember that so vividly. He had this little newspaper that he sold for two cents. And that had stuck in my mind. I remember so well the--on Sunday's we would all be going to church and how the whole neighborhood would turn out. And everybody was going to their own little different churches and things. And, oh I recall as a child too, the priest coming from Corpus Christi and coming into the neighborhood playing ball with the kids. Coming to our house and having dinner and oh that was a big, big, big deal. And my mother bragging about it to everybody about how Father (unclear) our house and he had dinner and all that. So all those kinds of things are memories that I have.
Speaker 2: Now wasn't--what was the church that black Catholics--West Court--?
Speaker 1: Corpus Christi. It was on the corner of 49th and at that time it was called South Park. It's now called King Drive.
Speaker 2: So that wasn't that far from your house?
Speaker 1: Not really.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Nah. It was maybe about a ten to fifteen minute walk.
Speaker 2: 'Cause black Catholics had to come from around Chicago to go to that (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Well actually there were three churches that black Catholics went to in the main. One was called St. Elizabeth on 41st and Wabash, one was St. Anselm on 61st and Michigan and then Corpus Christi on 49th and King Drive. And then there was one on the west side called St. (unclear).
Speaker 2: I was thinking earlier--at one point okay. Now what--Were there any smells that you can--?
Speaker 1: The stockyards. I remember that vividly. The stockyards they would--sometimes the smell was overwhelming.  And my father worked in the stockyards. So he used to come home with stories about slicing cows and all that kind of business.  And yeah. That's my vivid smell I can remember.
Story_ID: 17169
Speaker 1: What was family life like?
Speaker 2: I had a very delightful family. I really did. My father [Samuel Clements] really loved us. He'd come home line each one of us up, my mother  [Aldonia Peters Clements] would always be first and he'd kiss her. And then he'd go down the line and kiss each one of us. And I remember when I was eleven years old. It was on my birthday, January 26th. My father went down the line. And when he got to me he started to and I said, "Daddy I'm eleven today. I'm too old for you to kiss." And he says, "Well if I don't kiss you now, I won't kiss you the rest of your life." And I said, "Kiss me daddy!" (laughs). I remember that so well 'cause he didn't crack a smile. He was very serious, you know. But I had open affection. You know, my mother would hug us and I never wanted to ever get hurt playing ball or something. Because when I'd come in the house, you know, and I was bleeding or something, my mother would, "Ahhh!" , she'd just fall out. It was worse (unclear) her thing.  So we would always keep away from her any kind of thing that happened to us. Because, you know how ma's gonna do. She's just, you know, she just couldn't stand the thought of one of her children being hurt. And it was a very loving family. We all had to be there for dinner together. And you had to eat what was on your plate. If you didn't everything that was on your plate, well then you just sat there until you did eat. And you weren't allowed to act crazy at the table or anything. You know, we were supposed to act like you got, as they used to say, like you got some sense. And there were no real rigid rules. We had to be in when the streetlights came on. And my mother was always into this business of when you did something wrong she'd slap you or hit you or whatever. But it didn't mean nothing to us. One thing she had in her arsenal and that was when she would say, "Okay. Just wait 'til your father gets home." And we would just be furious with her. Really we got really angry. Because that was what we would consider dirty pool. That was wrong because we'd say, "Well why are you getting him into it? Leave him out of it." And it wasn't so much because we thought he would hurt us, you know, spank us real hard or anything. It was because he wasn't supposed to be into that. You know, that wasn't his role. And besides that we knew he would be very disappointed in us. And we didn't want to do that to Daddy. You know. And every now and then she'd do that. And we'd get so angry with her. We really would. 'Cause you just didn't do that. You know. I don't know, I guess there was kind of some unwritten rules or something. And we'd take a hundred spankings from her rather than one from him. Because what he would say invariably was, "Okay, you know you're gonna get it." And then we'd wait and we'd wait and we'd wait. And we'd even go to him, turn around and say, "Daddy just do it. Get it over with." And we'd wait, wait.  And then finally at that point when we have figured, "Well he's forgotten all about it." And that's when he'd call you. And it just--We knew it hurt him more than it did us. You know, that kind  of thing. But yeah, I have a lot of good memories.
Speaker 1: Were there discussions around the dinner table that you remember? anything or any special occasions?
Speaker 2: The discussions were almost always about things that were happening in our family at large. About aunts, cousins stuff. A lot of stories about what happened with a lot of the women in our family who were domestics and who were working over on the north shore for these white people. And all of the ways that they got around these white people and stole things from them and everything else. And how stingy the white people were and things that they heard the white people talking about. And they would come and give--these were all illustrations of how evil white people were. And it was always a negative thing about whites, all--practically all the time. There were very few times when they would say anything positive about whites. And my mother really did--My father didn't do this, but my mother really did teach us to be afraid of white people. She said, "They can hurt you and they can do a lot of harm to you. You know, be very careful around them and so forth." And we grew up, you know, feeling that white folks were the enemy. But you know it was kind of strange. Despite that, there were some white people who walked in and out of our neighborhood with impunity. The insurance man would come and nobody thought of hurting him. There were white peddlers who would come around selling stuff. And you know, no problem. You know, white storekeepers there. There were Jewish storekeepers there. And they--So, I don't know. It was kind of a dichotomy.  It was kinda hard to really explain. But that was the way it was.
Story_ID: 17170
Speaker 1: First, Corpus Christi [Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].  When you were there, were there any particular teachers that influenced you?
Speaker 2: Yeah. My seventh grade teacher. Sister Mary Felician (ph.) She took a real liking to me. She was in charge of the altar boys. And she made me the head of the altar boys. And she was just a very, very kind person who would always tell us about how important we were. And she would even go down the line and say, "Now you're gonna be the governor. And you're gonna be the mayor of Chicago. And you're gonna be a movie star," and all this, you know.  She'd do all that stuff. And, you know, 'cause we--just made us feel like we were on top of the world. And when some kid did something that he shouldn't do, she would--tears would come. And oh, we would be so angry with that kid. You know. She wouldn't hit him or anything. But she would just--she was so disappointed. And there were some guys in the class who would actually grab that kid. And when he got outside he'd kick his butt. 'cause, you know, "You did that to Sister Felician, you know how she is, you know. We don't play that shit in here," (laughs). You know. And she was just a very, very interesting lady. Then she told me. towards the end of the year, before I was going into eighth grade she said, "You're gonna become a priest." And I said, "Yeah?  You think so?" She said, "Yeah." I said, "Oh great." So then I got in eighth grade and she was making all these plans and everything. And then all of a sudden I couldn't see her. She would--every time I'd see her and I'd call her, she was always busy. She didn't have any time for me and I couldn't figure what had happened. So then I graduated from eighth grade and as I said, I found out later about Quigley. Because these--they were Franciscan priests at Corpus Christi. And of course, I did--those were the only priests I knew. So, I figured I'd become a Franciscan. I had been at Quigley [Seminary] about two years and I'd talked to a priest about it, about Sister Felician. And he got all serious. And his face got all drawn and everything. And he said, "I know what happened", I said, "What?" He said, "The Franciscans do not accept blacks," or coloreds or whatever it was he said. And he said--and that's what happened with her. And I didn't believe him. I said, "Oh I don't, I don't  think you know what you're talking about, Father." And I went to Sister Felician and she started crying and everything. And she said, "Yeah, that's what happened, George. That's exactly what happened." She said, "And I didn't know how to tell you." You know.
Speaker 1: But she's the one who influenced you though?
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: And do you think--You know, you said you like all the ceremony. You know, and--right? Didn't you say, you know,  that that's what you liked about you know (unclear)--?
Speaker 2: I liked more than the ceremony, I like the fact that the priests helped people. That they were there for us. They weren't off somewhere. They would come into the neighborhoods. They would see to it that--somebody died they were right there and they were--They were always around and being helpful and I liked that. I liked that very, very much. And I wanted to imitate them. That's the reason I became a priest because of the good example of those priests that were there at Corpus Christi.
Story_ID: 17171
Speaker 1: How did the decision to go to Cris--I mean Quig--Quigley. Right? Quigley? How did that come about? And what was the process? If she's planted the seeds then it would make you--.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I told you about the seminary down in Bay St. Louis [Mississippi], where they--and my father told me I couldn't go there. So then I'd made up my mind, well okay I just won't go into the seminary. And then later that summer there was a deacon.  Now this is what we call a transitional deacon. A man who was in the seminary and there was one year left for him to become a priest. He--his name was George Powers. He was right here in Washington, D.C. studying at Catholic University. George Powers had this grand idea of coming to Chicago and going to the parish--the black parishes in Chicago, to the schools, and getting students there who were promising and taking them to the white Catholic high school and enrolling them. I mean he did--this was his own idea. And looking back it's just--you know, it's amazing that somebody would have that kind of nerve back then. Because, you know, we weren't going there to white Catholic high school. So sure enough he came to Corpus Christi and he was telling the priests there what he wanted to do and the nuns. And one of the nuns said, "Well, you know, there's George Clements. And he's been talking about becoming a priest." So he came over to our house. And he told me about Quigley [Seminary]. I said, "Quigley, what's that?" and he said, "Well that's a seminary for Diocesan priests." I said, "Diocesan priests. What's that?" And he said, "Don't worry about it.  But I'll take you down there." So sure enough the next day he took me to Quigley. This is really something. He took me into the office and he said, "I wanna enroll--get this kid enrolled." And the dean, Debo, Leo Debo, a real German. He looked at Powers he said, "Enrollment was over in June." And so Powers says, "Yeah, I know. But this is, you know, a colored kid," and all that. He said, "The enrollment is over." And he says, "Yeah but you know--." And then they started to get into a big argument. And the director overheard the argument, Smith. Monsignor Smith came out, and you know. "What's going on?" And they told him. And he looked at Debo and he said, "Enroll him." And Debo was furious. Ooh!  He was so mad. And I spent five years at Quigley. That was the term. And from that day until I graduated he always insisted that I was not supposed to be there. And I found out that I could have polka dot, striped, Irish whatever. It didn't make any difference. The enrollment-'cause Debo had that German mentality of, you know, rules laws (laughs) and all that. And after I became a priest I talked to him about it. And he said, "Well you have to understand that the rule is the rule. And I still say you should not have been enrolled," (laughs). And I--You know, I wanted to say, "You're the kind of guy who would put bodies in ovens (laughing). You're the kind of guy that could do it with no thought about it." Because, you know, he just had tunnel vision. But anyhow, yeah. That's how I got in.
Speaker 1: Now how was--this is a different experience though when you go to Quigley.
Speaker 2: Oh very much so.
Speaker 1: And I wa--because this is outside of your cloistered environment?
Speaker 2: Oh, this is a whole new world. I'm the only fly in the buttermilk. I'm the only black in this whole institution of some 500 students. And it was--it was just a whole new world. And I would come home talking about it. And the only one in my family who really seemed to really understand what was going on was [sister] Julia. And she really would tell me about how I was supposed to react. I remember once I was coming home 'cause at Quigley you went back and forth. I was on the 'El' and I was--in second year we had Greek. And I was doing my Greek. And there was a white guy sitting next to me. And he looked over and he said, "What are you doing?" And I said, "I'm doing my Greek homework." "Greek!" He said, "What do you--Greek! What do you need that for?" And I said, "I'm in the seminary and I'm studying Greek." And he said, "Greek! You're supposed to be studying auto mechanics or something like that. Nothing--Greek. That doesn't make any sense. Well you're--." And I went home and I was telling Julia about it. And she said--I'll never forget. She said, "You have to pray for ignorant white people. Because they just don't understand." I remember that so well.
Speaker 1: Now with--when you were--tell me though; I want you to just give some perspective to people watching about what the role of the seminary is.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, of a--.
Speaker 2: The word seminary means 'seed bed'. And it's the seed, of course, that's being--that's sown there. And being nurtured is to grow up and to become a flower--become a priest. And the life in the seminary, at that time, was extremely rigid. For example, we did not--We went to school on Saturdays and we got off on Thursday. Because we were to be shut-off from the rest of the community. Our classes were very difficult. We would start out, at that time, with roughly--Well let's put it this way. Roughly 10 percent of the students survived. Because it was just very, very rigid. The rules--they'd kick you out for the slightest little thing. I went to Quigley from 1945 to 1950. And we just simply had to obey all those rules. And things that in other schools would be minor infractions were looked upon as very, very serious there. And they would just kick you out. They'd kick you out right and left. I, of course, being the only black, had a unique situation at that school. And I can only describe it as everybody pretending that I was not black. Just kind of making me an honorary white person. And even some of the professors. Some of the priests who taught us. When we would be (unclear) in American history and we're studying about slavery. Quickly they'd go over that. You know, real quick 'cause they didn't wanna embarrass George. And everybody would be looking straight ahead. And nobody would dare look at me. 'Cause they don't want me to feel embarrassed or anything. And there was never any talk about race or anything having to do with race. Because they felt like if they did, well then that would make me uncomfortable. And that's students and faculty. That's--that was really the whole atmosphere there.
Speaker 1: Now was there screening at the time? I mean would they--?
Speaker 2: Oh it was rigid screening.
Speaker 1: Screening. So what were the things--What were they looking for character wise, out of--you know, out of someone? I mean besides--?
Speaker 2: They were looking for discipline. That you could accept these rules and regulations. They were looking for prayerfulness that you would come on time to all of their spiritual exercises. Mass every day and all the different prayers and everything, rosary and so forth. They were looking for adherence to those rules. That was very, very important. And they were looking for things like neatness, cleanliness. They expected you to put on a front. You know, you certainly couldn't use any improper language, anything like that. Lot of respect. Oh, that was a big thing. You had to respect those priest. In the hallway you bowed your head "Oh Father." And all that. You know conformity is really what it came down to. And it was very, you know, insistent on that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: What was an average day like. How would it start and so what was the--?
Speaker 2: Well classes began at 8:00 in the morning. So that meant I'd have to leave home around a quarter to 7. Get on the 'El' and get there to class and morning prayer, mass. And then we would start having our various classes. We have--we'd get out around 12:30, 12:00 something like that and have lunch. And then we would have--classes would resume. We didn't have any real recess or anything like that. You had a little period after lunch, but nothing of any, you know, length of time. Because you were always here on the campus. You know, you weren't allowed to go out anything like that. And that's pretty much the way it was. You get out at--I think we got out at 3:15 something like that and get on the 'El' and go home. Although. A lot of times, I would stay behind. Especially as the years went on, third, fourth year and I got in with my classmates. And we would have ball games and things like that afterwards.
Speaker 1: Did they teach you anything or, you know, the expectation--?
Speaker 2: Now this. Excuse me, this is a minor seminary. This is totally different from what's called a major seminary.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Because that's more cloistered?
Speaker 2: Oh a major seminary we lived there and you never left.
Speaker 1: You never left.  That's why--But that's what--this is what--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: This is where my question is going. How did they teach you to deal (unclear) the world? You know, because--.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: These are the times that you are--.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: At puberty. And I mean and just the whole, you know--?
Speaker 2: You were supposed to have what is called a spiritual director and you were supposed to go to him if you have any questions in your mind about puberty, girls whatever. And you were supposed to discuss it with him. Each student had a spiritual director. Now the life at Quigley was totally different than it was in what we call the major seminary. That's St. Mary of The Lake in Mundelein, Illinois. And there we were totally cut off from the world. I mean totally, there were no radios, no newspapers, no TV. And the classes were all in Latin. The rules were extremely rigid. We had what was called philosophy and theology. And the philosophy was the first three years, theology the next four years. And the philosophers and the theologians were totally segregated in every way. Including in the dining hall and everywhere. We were not supposed to mix. And lets see, I think we went into philosophy with about 110 students the first year. By the end of philosophy we were down to about seventh-five. And then by the end of theology, after four years, we were ordained with about fifty-six.
Story_ID: 17172
Speaker 1: Just a little more back to Quigley [Seminary]. So I just want--besides the--Debo?  Besides him are you saying that the environment was a sort of welcoming environment? That it--did it resemble Corpus Christi--?
Speaker 2: Oh no totally--.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm just saying--.
Speaker 2: No. It was totally different from Corpus Christi.
Speaker 1: Besides the discipline.  I'm saying was it a nur--did it have a nurturing quality (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I understand what you're saying. You're asking me did I feel comfortable there. I did and I didn't. I certainly didn't feel white, even though they tried to make me think I was white. I tried to act white, but I didn't feel it. I did have--about three, maybe four of the priests there who really went out of their way to be kind to me and to be helpful. And I really appreciated that because I did feel alone many times. I remember one instance this priest who was a real racist--dead now. And we had a singing class. Everybody was in the class. And the whole--we were in the auditorium. And he would pick out songs we were supposed to sing. And there was one song where--I'm trying to think of the name of the song now. "Oh niggers all work on the Mississippi. Niggers all work while the white folks play--."
Speaker 1: 'Show Boat'.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'Show Boat'.
Speaker 1: 'Ole Man River'.
Speaker 2: And we were singing that. And he had us sing it. And then he said, "No. Now you gotta get this verse again. Sing it again 'cause you didn't get it right." And then we'd sing it again. And the people were all squirming and all that. And he'd say, "Come on sing it again." And I think the third time is when I got up and I walked out. And everybody--'cause that's, that's--to get up and walk out of class was tantamount to just saying you're ready to leave, 'cause that was an infraction that you would--you'd get kicked out for that. And he kind of looked at me. And he had a real crazy smile on his face, I remember, what have you. Prebble was his name--as I walked out. And it just so happened that as soon as I got outside--and I to this day, can't tell you what really gave me the courage to do that. But as soon as I got out of the door and closed the door, who comes down the hall but the rector. And he said, "What are you doing out here?" And I told him what had happened. And he went in there. And he called Prebble out. And I heard--they were kind of arguing with each other. And then he went in and he asked some of the students what happened. And they got up and told him. And then he told the whole class, he said, "This is the last day that Father Prebble will be teaching at Quigley." And they kicked him out.
Story_ID: 17173
Speaker 1: How was the whole experience [at Archbishop Quigley Prepatory Seminary, Chicago, Illinois]? How did it change you? And you went and you really wanted to go to seminary. And were there times--?
Speaker 2: It changed me in this way. You mean after I became a priest.  Or--?
Speaker 1: No I'm talking about even--I'm saying even the Quigley experience. Because you went there really wanting to go. You know--.
Speaker 2: Oh yes. I went into the seminary totally free. I did not--Nobody forced me. As a matter of fact, after I got into Quigley, I had been there may two or three years and I started talking to my parents about it. And I started telling them that I don't want to go here, this is crazy. I said, "I don't have any friends or nothing. And I'm gonna quit." And so my father would say, "Well that's your decision." And my mother. And I'd say, "Yeah, but what about you all? What do you all want me to do?" And they would both say, "Whatever you wanna do." And I could not pin them down, ever. That--I was in the seminary for twelve years and not at any point could I ever get my mother or my father to say, "We want you to stay. We want you to go." They was always totally that way. And my sisters and brothers, you know, like my sister Ida she would say all the time, "Oh, you oughta get out of there. That's crazy." And Julia, now she would encourage me. She thought it was something that was very worthwhile. But I didn't get any real encourage from my other sisters and brothers. So I was, you know, I was--it was really my decision to make the whole time I was there. But there were many times when I just felt like, "This is ridiculous." I, however, had this notion in my mind-Which looking back it's kind of sad in a way. That I was holding up the banner for black people all of the world (laughs). That if I did--if I flunked Greek or something, well then I'm letting our people down. And so--oh I can say this too. I had a rude awakening when I first--my first week at Quigley, when I got there and realized I wasn't the smartest person in the class. I was stunned. I couldn't believe all these white kids that were so smart. But then also I couldn't believe all these white kids that were so dumb. And so many of them who would laugh when they would--we'd get our report cards and we'd be comparing. And one guy would say, "Yeah, well it looks like I'm getting out of here 'cause I flunked such and such." And I couldn't believe they could laugh about it. 'Cause to me that was serious business, you know. And really all the way through the seminary, even in Mundelein [St. Mary of the Lake Seminary] , I couldn't get off--out of my head that I would--carried black people, "That if I flunk well then its gonna make everybody look bad and so forth." And its just kind of like the opposite of what a lot of black kids have today. You know where, shoot. They don't think that they (laughs),  "You know, I ain't got nothing to do with other black people because I don't do well or do well."
Speaker 1: But that was the time too.
Speaker 2: Very much so.
Speaker 1: And you were a ground breaker. So it doesn't--you know its understandable. But was there other ways that you changed during the Quigley experience? Any other thing that sort of changed about, you know, George the person?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Very definitely my thoughts about race changed. Because I saw how so many of those kids lived so well. They had cars. They're parents gave them so much. They used to complain about the food which I thought (laughs) was pretty good food. Better food than I get at home. And I just realized that they lived a life style that was so above mine. I would go to their homes. And they had these beautiful homes that they lived in. Some of them had servants, maids and all that stuff, gardeners. And it was just like a whole 'nother world. And I would come back to my little world there in the valley, and it just didn't compare. And so I started-- gradually started thinking, "Why is it that black people can't talk right, walk right and act right? Why is it that we have such a negative value system? You know, drinking, cursing and stuff like that?" And I really, especially in the major seminary, I got in my mind firmly planted that if we could just get into integration and if we could just start acting like white people, wyow! That could solve all our problems. Because we could become assimilated. And we wouldn't have all the difficulties that we're having now. And so gradually I began to talk like white people, walk like white people, act like white people. Say the things I knew white people wanted said. And I was--by the time I was ordained I was perfectly accepted. That was in 1957. And people loved me. When I was ordained there was a whole flock of white people that came to my ordination. And other parishes would invite me to come and speak and all that. Because I was perfectly--I was a nice colored priest. I really, really was, you know.  And so that part of my life certainly did go through a metamorphosis.
Story_ID: 17174
Speaker 1: The transition from Quigley [Seminary] to St. Mary [of the Lake Seminary], was it a easy one? The isola--I mean there you're really--I guess it was gr--sort of gradual.
Speaker 2: It wasn't so difficult, because I had been primed when I was at Quigley. So it wasn't all that difficult.
Speaker 1: So what was different about that besides the isolation?
Speaker 2: The camaraderie with my classmates. We became very, very close. The feeling that I was very different from other people and also the instilling in me by the seminary that I had a responsibility to get out here and really help my fellow man. Particularly help him spiritually. Help him get to heaven. That was the duty that I had as a priest. And I had to carry that out. You know, it was made very, very clear to me in the seminary that to whom much has been given, much will be expected. And those were the things that had happened.
Speaker 1: Now were you also starting to think about how, you know, once you were ordained, what you wanted to do and accomplish and give back? Or was that--were you sort of on a path that was--?
Speaker 2: No, I wanted to go out and make myself available for people. I wanted to be very amenable, approachable. They used to talk about that all the time. To be approachable. I wanted people to be able to say they wanted to come to me for advice and consolation and so forth. And I really felt like I wanted to be a model priest. I really did. And you know, I really thought that I had excellent training. Certainly I was given the basics with philosophy and theology and languages and so forth and Latin and everything. I was--I felt like I was really equipped.
Speaker 1: Now that--the period with St. Mary's was it four years?
Speaker 2: Seven years.
Speaker 1: It was seven years. So seven years of isolation. Were your--were you like when you came back--?
Speaker 2: Also during the summer months we were isolated. 'Cause we had--during  summer we had a villa up in Northern Wisconsin. And we went up there and spent the summer.
Speaker 1: So when you came out--I mean once you're ordained, does the world seem like a different place, like you--I mean I'm just, you know--?
Speaker 2: Yeah. We used to have an expression where we would talk about people outside the seminary as real people (laughs). Yeah. That was the real world. Yeah, the world was different. But the world was a place that needed me and the other priests. There was the scriptural thing about going therefore out into the world teaching people, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. And we went out with that bold in mind. That we were gonna evangelize the world. We had that notion (laughs). I wanted to say childish (laughs), but in a certain sense it was childish.
Speaker 1: Now anything else about St. Mary's that was significant? Anything--?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Certainly the beauty of the place. And, you know, each one of us had our own private room and all that. And it was a very structured environment. And it--.
Speaker 1: How many hours of solitude a day? Do you think?
Speaker 2: Hours? Well you'd get up early in the morning.
Speaker 1: Early--?
Speaker 2: We were up at 5:30 in the morning. And then we had to be--lights out--were out at 9:00 in the evening. And there was a lot of time spent in the chapel, holy hours and things like that, devotion, prayer, silence. A lot of silence. That was one thing I came to really respect and like is the period that was called the 'Magnum Silencicum'. That was from 9:00 at night when lights were out until after breakfast in the morning. And there were--no one could talk. And I liked that. Because that time of the morning I didn't want to talk to anybody. I didn't want anybody talking to me. You know, I liked that. You know, that you didn't have to have any small talk that time of morning.
Story_ID: 17175
Speaker 1: How many cat--categories of priests are there? There are a lot--.
Speaker 2: There's big differences between diocesan priests and religious priests. Now a diocesan priest is ordained for a particular area of the world. For example, Chicago, New York, Washington, D.C., L.A. and so forth. And you, when you're ordained, that's where you stay. It's kind of an anomaly for me to be here in Washington, D.C.. I by all rights should be in Chicago, I'm on loan to Washington, D.C. 'cause Chicago's where I belong. Now religious order priests, they can go anywhere around the world. Because they belong to a particular order, Jesuits, Benedictions, Franciscans whatever and they go wherever their order is. And their order would have some particular goal. For example, maybe working with the sick. Or they may all deal with communications or they might all have schools like Jesuits or something like that. A religious order has different things that they do.
Speaker 1: Did the religious order exist before diocesan priests? Or was that--?
Speaker 2: Nah. Diocesan priests came along--we all--there really were no religious orders. There were onl--the first priests were the apostles. And, you know,  then gradually, as time went on, various religious orders developed.
Speaker 1: Now so you--you're--when you're ordained, you're the second African American that is ordained in the city--.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: Of Chicago?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: And that wasn't--There were other African Americans around the country that had been ordained. But Chicago--were there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there were, but very, very few.
Speaker 1: Very few.
Speaker 2: Very few. Let's see. The first one in Chicago was Father Lambert, Rolands Lambert. And--.
Speaker 1: And he had been ordained how many years before you?
Speaker 2: Seven years. When I was ordained in '57 [1957], I'm estimating there were probably fifty, sixty black priests around the nation. And really it hasn't increased much since then. There's only about three hundred now.
Speaker 1: 'Cause that--someone told me that there're probably maybe twenty in Chicago tops. Maybe.
Speaker 2: Nah, its not that many.
Speaker 1: Not even twenty?
Speaker 2: Not that many.  I'd say Chicago has about thirteen.
Speaker 1: That's not great numbers.  So (laughs) anyway.  And we're not talking about the ci--we're talking about 1957 and '50-- 1950 and '57.
Speaker 2: And, you know, you figure too, Chicago is the second largest--was the largest diocese in the nation until all of the Latinos came up from Mexico . And now Los Angeles is.
Story_ID: 17176
Speaker 1: My first church was St. Ambrose. And very interesting. Because at that time we were not--maybe they've stopped.  St. Ambrose.  At that time we were not able to pick where we were gonna go, or even suggest. They told you where to go. And it was so ironic that I was sent to St. Ambrose. Because when I was at [Achbisop] Quigley [Preparatory Seminary], I lived, as I told you on 50th and St. Lawrence. And there was a classmate of mine who lived over on 47th and Woodlawn, Cottage Grove was a dividing line at that time. And no blacks were on--East of Cottage Grove. Well this classmate asked me to come spend the night at his house one Saturday night. We did. And then got up the next morning and went to his church which was St. Ambrose. And the church was really full. We were sitting in the back. And the priest, Father Quinn, Frank J. Quinn, he got up in the pulpit and he started, and then he looked out. And he looked me way back and he said, "I'll have no niggers in this church." And the ushers came up to us. And we, the two of us, we left laughing. Because we figured, "Oh this way we don't have to go to mass, ha, ha, ha." You know, we thought it was funny. And it wasn't, you know, any big, big, big deal to us at that time. Well now here it is, I get ordained and my assignment was to St. Ambrose. By this time Quinn is gone. They take me up to my quarters, when I got there. And I go into the bedroom. And there was this big spread over this king size bed. And there was a cameo in the center. And it said F. J. Q., Frank J. Quinn (laughs). I thought, "Wow! God's got a sense of humor," (laughs.) I know he's twirling around in his grave that, here I am sleeping in his bed.
Story_ID: 17177
Speaker 1: Do you remember your day of ordination?
Speaker 2: Oh very much.
Speaker 1: Can you describe it?
Speaker 2: Well it was May the 3rd 1957.  All of my family was there. It was at the chapel at Mundelein [St. Mary of the Lake Seminary]. And it was a day in which I felt like I had entered heaven. I just felt like this is what I've been working for all these years and its finally come. And I remember when it was over and we were out--we given--We each were assigned a section out--outside in the lawn. And we had this crowd of people come that we would give our blessing to each person who came up. And my mother and father were the first ones. And I remember my mother was crying. And my father, I just remember so well he took my hands. And his hands were really hard. And I thought to myself, "Now he did all of this for me. You know, that in all those years that he sacrificed and everything. Worked at the stockyards." And that's one vivid memory of my--about my ordination day. And I also remember how we all thought it was so ridiculous that they told our families right after, all the blessing and everything, then the families all had to leave. Because we were all taken to the big dining hall. And that was the one time when the theologians and philosopher could all be together. And we had a big, huge meal and, you know, celebration and speeches and all that. And we felt like, "Now this is ridiculous that they don't let our families, you know, take part in this." But that was--that was the way it was then. Now all of this has changed now. You know, none of this goes on now.
Speaker 1: So you were about twenty-five at that time?
Speaker 2: I was twenty- five years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And given responsibility for St. Ambrose?
Speaker 2: Oh no.
Speaker 1: Oh you were an--.
Speaker 2: Oh I was one--.
Speaker 1: Assistant.  That's right.
Speaker 2: Of three.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There was the pastor and then there were two other associates and myself.
Story_ID: 17178
Speaker 1: I was very much a purist. And when I came there I was assigned to work with the youngsters, with the teenagers and the children in the school. And I loved it. I had a wonderful time. I was as happy as anybody could be, but I was also told that I was not to go East of Lake Park. Because that's where they called Indian Village. All those high rises over there and that was totally white. And pastor telling me, "You stay away from over there period," 'cause, you know, we'd go bring communion to the sick and all that. And St. Ambrose was an interesting place. Because South of 47th were those big, huge homes in Kenwood. You know, people were wealthy. And then north was just the opposite. You know, mostly black and really kind of a bad area. And that--the black area is where I wanted to be,  you know, 'cause I felt like, "Ahh back with my people and all that." You know, and I enjoyed the teenagers. We did all kinds of things together. We went on hayrides, swimming, beach parties and all that stuff and had basketball teams. They had a place at St. Ambrose that had been closed down for years, a youth center. And it was all musty, and you know, cobwebs all over the place. I opened it up. It had bowing alleys and it had ping-pong and pool tables and all that. And the kids flocked there. We had a big, huge youth center. Kids would come from other areas to be a part of St. Ambrose youth club. So I had a wonderful time there. But an interesting thing happened. There was a very wealthy family, Frank J. Lewis. You know, Lewis University and Lewis Memorial Hospital at that time, and all that. And even Loyola. He's the one who donated Lewis Towers, you know, on the near North side and so forth. And he was--the guy was filthy rich. He used to come to St. Ambrose. And the pastor, when the Lewis family would come in this chauffeured driven Cadillac. And he'd be out in front and he'd open the door. And they would come out. And he was just very, you know, this was his (unclear). You know, these people contributed a lot. So anyhow, he was out playing golf one day. And the nurse called and she said that Frank Lewis was very sick. And he needed a priest. And I said, "Well the pastor isn't here now. But as soon as he comes in I'll tell him." So the nurse said, "Well, you know, you come over then, Father." And I said, "Oh I can't." And I hung up, you know. 'Bout five minutes later Mrs. Lewis was on the phone and she said, "My husband is dying. And the nurse said that you weren't gonna come." And I said, "Well, okay I'll come." So I did. And I went over and gave him the last rights. And then when pastor came home from his golf, he--I started telling him about Frank Lewis was dying. I'd gave--He says, "What!  What!  I told you not to do it." And he was furious. He put his collar on real quick and ran out. And by the time he got over there, Frank Lewis was dead (Laughs). And I remember that so well, you know.
Story_ID: 17179
Speaker 1: How'd the purist become the activist?
Speaker 2: Right.  Because okay, see the first time (unclear).
Speaker 1: Alright.  now here-yeah, I was at St. Ambrose for 5 years. I left St. Ambrose and was assigned to another church, St. Dorothy. At St. Dorothy, the pastor was the exact opposite of the one at St. Ambrose. Totally opposite. Father Scanlon. He was way ahead of his time. A brilliant old Irishman--.
Speaker 2: Okay, Father Clements, you were actually talking about what started you. You know, started you--.
Speaker 1: Right.  Called the transition from being the purist to the activist. When I was at St. Dorothy, my second assignment, the priest there, Father Gerald Scanlon was an extremely unusual man. Very, very brilliant guy. He was much blacker than almost any black person at that time. That would be from '62 to '69 [1962-1969]. And those were the sizzling sixties. And he was in the forefront of all the various movements and so forth. And he advocated violence. He said that the only way that black people would ever be able to achieve their independence from--in America, their freedom would be when they became violent. Because that's the only language that America understands. And so when the riots started, he would get up in the pulpit and say, "Yeah, did you hear the great news? Watch the Birmingham riot." And, you know, this was a middle class black parish. And those middleclass blacks did not go for that at all. They were very upset with Scanlon with his--And he would say stuff like, "Black people should never allow white people to have any position of prominence in the black community until they are allowed to have comparable positions in the white community. So there shouldn't be any white police chief, white fire chief, white postmaster, white anything." he says, "Until they let us do it--." And then he would say, "And I include myself. But I should not be in charge of this parish. You got this perfectly capable black man here. And he should be the pastor here." And so this went on and on. Until finally one day Scanlon got up. He says, "I'm tired of talking. We gotta actually do something. I'm gonna go down to the Cardinal [Cody] and tell him that I resign and that Clements is to be the pastor." Well by this time, of course, Scanlon was a scandal (laughs) in the whole diocese. And the bishop couldn't stand him. You know, he hated Scanlon. And Scanlon went down that morning. And he actually did tell him. And he says, "I gladly accept your resignation. I'm not about to make Clements the pastor." And because by that time the change had taken place. Now what happened in the change? Well I pointed to Scanlon as providing the groundwork. Because I was amazed to hear a white man, say and do the kinds of things he did--he said and did. I have a picture over there of the first march on Washington. That was Scanlon. Scanlon chartered a railroad car. And had our men from St. Dorothy come to the first march on Washington. That's way back in '63 [1963]. So any way, I was just-I was really kind of formed under him. And I got more and more gutsy about the whole question of race. But then what really did it was April 4, 1968. When that bullet went through Dr. King's head, that was when I realized that so much of what I had been all my life--all my priestly life and in the seminary too, was a hypocrite. I came back and I looked in the mirror and the face starring back at me was that of a clergy prostitute. And I said, "From that day on I was gonna be what Mr. and Mrs. Clements made me. A black man." And I started doing those things that made some people, some people  think that I had really lost my mind. Because I got involved with the Black Panthers. I got involved with starting the Black Police League, the Black Fireman's League. I got involved in the Black Postmaster's Group. I got involved with all kinds of things. And the diocese and everybody were all put on their ear. And it was  shortly after this that the big--when Scanlon went down and made this pronouncement to the Cardinal. And so when the cardinal told him that he wasn't gonna make the pas--Scanlon came back to the parish. Got up that Sunday. And he sold everybody. He says, "Do you know they're gonna bring a white man in here. When you got this perfectly capable black man. And are you gonna stand for this? Are you gonna--?" they said, "No, No, No. We're not gonna stand for it." And all that. He got whipped up. And he whipped them up in  a frenzy. And the next thing you know, this is all over the papers and TV and everything. So, the cardinal--Cardinal Cody at the time--he thought he would be really slick. Remember there was a black priest ahead of me, Lambert. He had just made Lambert the pastor of St. James at 29th and Wabash. He called Lambert in. He said, "You are gonna be the pastor of St. Dorothy." And Lambert said, "No, No 'cause people will say I'm an Uncle Tom and all that." And he says, "I order you on your vows." So Lambert accepted. And then Lambert did something that blew everybody's mind. Because Lambert was such a wonderfully, holy, decent (unclear) man. And nobody would ever dream of him doing this. Right after he came to St. Dorothy, he called a press conference. He said, "I should have been named the pastor of St. Dorothy, not him. It was a political move making him the pastor. That unless I were made a pastor, he was gonna resign from St. Dorothy." And he said that the Cardinal is a racist. And this went out all over the nation. First time any black priest had ever called his bishop a racist. And, of course, Cody was furious. And that was when Cody called me in. And told me that he was gonna make me the pastor of Holy Angels. And this class man I told you about Mullet. He said, "Making me the pastor of Holy Angels was like a slave ship coming from Africa to America. And over the Atlantic Ocean had developed severe nautical problems. Its about to sink. And the captain calls all the slaves up and he says, "Boys we're gonna  give you this ship. And they (laughing) get in the rowboats and row off." Because Holy Angels was slated for demolition at that time. It was really in a bad way. But I was glad to get it. Because I knew that area. You know, I was born right there, 50th--51st and St. Lawrence. So--so I told him that I had done a lot of research in the history of Holy Angels.
Story_ID: 17180
Speaker 1: I told him that I had done a lot of research in the history of Holy Angels [Church]. At the turn of the century it was a totally Irish area. And that the Irish had gone down to the bishop to tell him that they wanted to put a parish up. And the bishop said, "You can't do that. You don't have the wherewithal. You know (unclear)--." And they said, "They went--came back and started building the church themselves. And the story is that the bishop came in his horse and buggy and he saw that the church was almost built. He says, "Oh I see you have a church. I must send priests." And that's how it started. And then they had a big party. And at the party one of them got up and said, "We got it together by ourselves." And I said, "Now that is--We're gonna resurrect that here. And we're gonna say we got it together by ourselves. Because we are no longer going to be on ecclesiastical welfare." 'Cause we were getting a subsidy $100,000 every year. And I said, "From now on they can keep their subsidy 'cause we are going to do it by ourselves. And the people just kinda looked at each other like, you know, this fool.  And I said, "Now I know a lot of you think that I don't know what I'm talking about."  I said, "But we're gonna take up the collection right now.  And I'll show you what I mean."  So we took up the collection.  And then after we took it up I said, "Now the first time in your lives you'll ever see this.  We're counting it right now in front of you."  So we counted it.  It wasn't much at all.  I said, "Now do you think I'm gonna run this church like this?"  I said, "I'm not gonna go around to these white folks begging.  And I will just quit. I will. If you don't give me what you-what I know you got."  I said, "I know this place.  You can't put it over on me crying poor mouth like you do with these white guys."  I said, "I know what you got with your Johnnie (unclear) Walker Scotch and your cars and all that."  I said, "I know what you got.  So we're gonna get it."  I said, "We're taking up another collection. Right now."  And I said, "For those of you who think you can get out, change your minds 'cause the doors have already been locked."  I said, "I told the ushers to lock the doors."  So we took up another collection.  Counted that.  It wasn't too bad.  I said, "I think one more go around will do it (laughs).  And we did.  I said, "Now understand this.  Every time you come here you are gonna be expected to come in with my money."  I said, "I can't run this place without money.  And I'm not asking white folks."  And they all went home and they were all amazed.  "You know, this priest got up here talking crazy like this."  And we got to the point where our budget was about a million a year.  And, you know, we made it.  In fact, we--by the time we had gotten really going, we became the largest black catholic school in the nation and had a thriving parish. And my whole thinking was that these protestant churches they don't have any sugar daddy downtown they can go to.  You know, they gotta make it or they sink or swim.  And I told (unclear) that we were the same way.  And then later on the diocese announced that they were gonna have a sharing system.  Where wealthy parishes share and help poor parishes.  And so I got up and made an announcement.  That we were involved in the sharing.  I said, "Only we're gonna share with a poor white parish, St. Bonaventure (laughs).  (unclear) and we're gonna share with them.  We're gonna  give--and, of course, the Sun-Times and all they picked that up.  You know, and we did a lot of things at Holy Angels that made  news.
Speaker 2: News.  A lot of news.
Speaker 1: A lot of things.
Story_ID: 17181
Speaker 1: I wanna ask you though, about your involvement with the Black Panthers.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you said that it was [Dr.] Martin Luther King's death that, you know--.
Speaker 2: Changed me.
Speaker 1: Really sort of changed you.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But, you know, that didn't mean that you would necessarily get involved with the Panthers.  Except (unclear) street leave.
Speaker 2: Well I got very involved with the Panthers at St. Dorothy. Because the Panthers went down during this time when Lambert and Cody and all that stuff, they went down to the Chancery office.  And they told him.  They said, "We gonna burn this down, if you don't make Clements a pastor."  And, you know, those guys weren't (unclear).  That was Fred Hampton. And then, of course, the kind of--I really got involved in '69 [1969] when Fred was murdered.  And then I had a big ceremony at our church.  And that was the time when I think 'Eyes on the Prize' has this. Where I'm up there preaching. And I just broke down.  I started crying.  I couldn't--just--I just couldn't deal with it.  and one of the fifth graders jumped up. And he said, "I am Fred Hampton."  And another kid, "I am Fred Hampton."  And by then the whole place was jumping up.  Everybody was screaming, "I am Fred Hampton," you know.  Now that was very, very gratifying.  But yeah, I did get involved with the Panthers.  I--their feeding program and everything was at Holy Angels.  I was very much into it.
Speaker 1: Were you ever involved with the Blackstone Rangers at all?
Speaker 2: Got very much involved with them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because our kids--they had their headquarters right down the street.  And Fred and Jeff Fort and our kids were getting beat up and all that.  And we were having a lot of problems with that gang.  And so I went down there. And I had a peace deal with Jeff.  And I told him that, I would not denounce them, if they would protect our kids.  And from that time one our kids never had any problems, getting off the bus and everything 'cause we had that kind of a detente at that time.  (unclear).
Speaker 1: Can you talk just a little bit--I mean you've talked  about this a lot about, you know, harboring Bobby Rush.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  That happened right after Fred Hampton was killed.  And they were really after Bobby.  And I remembered from the seminary this thing they called (ph.) 'use sanctuari' which means the right of sanctuary.  And during medieval times if you came to a church, then they could not take whoever was there. Because that was a sacred place. And they would be  violating--you know, it was an acting law.  That, you know, if somebody came into the church then they had sanctuary.  So I announced that Bobby was staying there with us.  And that this 'use sanctuari'--and the police were outside.  I mean, you know, they were--they were waiting.  They really did wanna get  him.  But they never did storm the place.  And then after it all got in the papers and everything, then they withdrew.  And a few days later Bobby was able to  come out.  But they wanted to do the same thing to him.  It was [Cook County State's Attorney General Edward V.] Hanrahan at that time. And people don't realize that Hanrahan really did run that city.  You know. He would've killed Bobby.  That was no idle threat.
Story_ID: 17182
Speaker 1: You were at Holy Angels for a long time actually.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was there--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) from 1959 to 1991.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about the progression of things there?  Because you came to a church that was, you know, in shambles.  And, you know, a new church home.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: So it takes time to-.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: For people to--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I think the big thing that happened at Holy angels is that there was instilled a sense of pride and a sense of independence.  A sense of-Like I said, we got it together by ourselves.  And we not depending on white folks, you know.  We may be in a poor area of the city, but we really are able to make it.  And I think that that was probably the best-and that was probably the real heritage that I left them.  With that sense of pride.  Holy Angels became known all over the nation.  We had a singing group called the Little Angels.  And they went around singing all over the country and so forth.  And then our kids were learning Spanish and French in kindergarten.  And we had made an announcement that you couldn't enroll your child in our school unless you had a voter registration card.  We had a big employment center at the parish.  And just any number of different things that we had there which put us on the map.
Speaker 1: Father Clements, what were the key tings that allowed for the growth?  I mean key people who were members that helped? Or--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I think the key things was that we were able to reverse the whole process that they have in the housing project of-When you come in, you come in at a certain level.  Income level.  If your income level rises, then your rent's gonna rise.  And so people are gonna move out.  So there was constant movement there.  Mobility was really strong.  But what happened with us is when they moved out, they would still come back.  Because they had found a home at Holy Angels.  So we were able to stop the erosion that was continually taking place.  'Cause so many of our people started out in public housing.  Ida B. Wells, Clarence Darrell, Washington Park Homes, Robert Taylor all those. State way Gardens and so forth.
Story_ID: 17183
Speaker 1: Cody was not a racist despite what Lambert said.  Cody was a paternalist.  He was one who really felt like all of us were his children.  And that, you know, blacks were no different than anybody else.  That we were supposed to do as we're told.  And he-You know, they made a movie about (unclear).  I don't know if you saw the movie.
Speaker 2: I didn't see the movie.
Speaker 1: If you want I have a copy--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh good.  That would be (unclear).
Speaker 1: If you ever wanna see it.  But in that movie it brings it out when we-Cody and I are having this big argument.  Karol O'Connor played the role of Cody and (pho.) Louis Gossig played my role.  And Cody says to me (yelling), "You belong to me boy. Don't you rea-you belong to me."  And I said, ( pho.) "Yowza Boss."  And he said, "Yeah, that's right," (Laughing).  And, you know, to him I acquiesced.  You know.  And he refused to see the mockery or the sarcasm in it.  You know.  Because as far as he was concerned we really did belong to him.  You know, that was just the way he was.  Now he certainly did get upset at many of the things that I did.  One of the biggest was when I took down St. Anthony's altar and I put up an altar to St.  Martin Luther King Jr.  And yeah.  He got very upset with that.  But he didn't force me to take it down.  You know.  He said, "Take it down."  I remember-I'll never forget that phone call.  And I said, "I'm not taking it down.  So if you want it down, you send somebody out here to do it."  I said, "but I can't guarantee their safety."  And he slammed (Laughing) the phone down.  You know.  But he didn't really-He was opposed to me.  But he also kind of went along with it.  You know.
Speaker 2: Why do you think that was?  Do you think it was just the times?
Speaker 1: Oh I think he was a cagey politician.  He was just very, very sharp.  He was a brilliant guy.  And he realized, you know, it's far worse to do something that's gonna really cause all kinds of consternation.  You know.  And just-and beside he knew that a lot of white people in Chicago who loved me for the wrong reasons.  Because what they loved was I was keeping the blacks in their own area. I wasn't talking about going out to their area.  And so they were, "You know, you fine as far as we concerned.  As long as he's down there with those people."
Story_ID: 17184
Speaker 1: Now the city of Chicago.  What role did they play, you know, during that?
Speaker 2: I was a mortal enemy of old man Daley [ref. to Chicago mayor Richard J. Daley].  He and I just didn't see eye to eye on nothing.  I called him a corrupt-In fact, one of the big things was when King died and the city council invited me to come there and speak the day after his death.  And I got up there and I said, "You know, it really is amazing that you would take this chance and have me come up here.  Because I'm telling you right now, if Dr. King were alive, he couldn't be here where I am now.  Which shows me that you're nothing but a bunch of whited (unclear).  You're a bunch of hypocrites.  And the biggest hypocrite of all is that fat Irishman up there.  He is-All of you are hypocrites."  And Wow!  They said he--Daley said, "That's the last time he'll ever get up in here," ,you know.  But yeah.  I was totally opposed to Daley.  'Cause as far as I was concerned he was a corrupt boss.  You know, a racist.  (laughs).
Speaker 1: (laughs) Now I give credit where it's due.  His some is a different story all together.  Different story all together.
Speaker 2: I think he is (unclear).  You think so?
Speaker 1: Oh he's a very subtle racist.
Speaker 2: He's subtle.  That's what I'm saying.
Speaker 1: He's very subtle.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well that's not different.
Speaker 1: Well that is different.
Speaker 2: You mean he's like (unclear) (laughs).
Speaker 1: It's different in that he's able to get things done.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know.  With his father  we were always the loggerheads and nothing got done.  You know.  We were always fighting, fighting, fighting.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This man is a lot smoother.
Speaker 2: But he's using a lot of the same techniques.
Speaker 1: Oh, of course, of course.
Story_ID: 17185
Speaker 1: Would you say that it took you--that your efforts really focused on the church-your church and the community for about twenty of those, you know, thirty years?
Speaker 2: My efforts were focused on Holy Angels. But they were also focused on black Catholics. And I really went around the nation talking in various black Catholic churches, and trying to get this sense of pride instilled.  You know, and telling them how important it is.  That we would have black images in our churches. And that we would really make the church make sense to black people.
Speaker 1: And Father Clements, what do you--what was the importance of that do you feel?  Because in the whole (unclear)--?
Speaker 2: The importance to my mind is that black people found a home in the Catholic church.  And it wasn't that they were being tolerated in a white church.  What I said is that we're in the Catholic church. And the fact is there are more black people in the catholic church than there are white people. And that we cannot allow them to state the terms upon which we are in this church.  And I would say all the time.  I said, "Look, I got black people who tell me that I'm a Uncle Tom for being in this white church.  I got white people telling me why don't I get out, if I don't like what's going on."  And I tell them left and right that, I ain't going nowhere.  Because they didn't put me in.  And they can't put me out.  Jesus Christ did it--put me in.  And He's the only one who can put me out.  So y'all do whatever you wanna do.  But I'm staying.  And I would say that everywhere.  I didn't, you know, I didn't say one thing out of one side of my mouth and another thing out of the other side.  I made it very clear where I stood.
Speaker 1: And once--so what you're saying is once the activism-activist  got let loose in you--that was it.
Speaker 2: That was when I felt finally comfortable with myself.  And I felt I was doing really what Christ wanted me to do. And I felt fulfilled in my priesthood when I did that.  And I finally got rid of those--that hypocrisy.
Story_ID: 17186
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your adopting the-you know, your child.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: And why you--why that issue became, you know--?
Speaker 2: What happened is--.
Speaker 1: You know (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I got a visit from a man by the name of Greg Kohler, who had just been appointed as head of the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services.  He came there one afternoon.  And the secretary called me and told me that, there's a guy wants to see you and all that.  I said, "Who is it?"  And she said, "Ah, some white man."  So I came out there. And sure enough this big Irishman--and he was going on and on and talking about how the big issue is going to be to him--as he starts his regime is going to be finding homes for homeless black children.  'Cause that's something that's been neglected and all.  And I was up there with a plastic smile.  "Yes, yes, I see."  And after about nine minutes, I figured I had given him enough of my time.  And I said, "Now Mr. Kohler, you come back any time.  And I'll be praying for you."  And I got--and he turned around and he said, "Hold it Father!"  He put his finger in my face.  He said, "You don't have to do this.  I'm leaving.  But I want you to know, that if you people are not interested in your own children, don't expect us to be."  And I looked at him.  I said, "No, you hold it brother.  Come here sit down. Sit down."  And then we started to really talk.  And I told him, we were gonna have a big gathering at my church in which we were going to be promoting black adoptions.  And I guaranteed him that we would be getting numerous black adoptions from our church.  We-I--we were supposed to be signing up for this meeting. And the Sunday before the meeting, I figured, you know, we're gonna get about 500 people or so there. I got there and there were thirteen names on the list where they're supposed to be signing. And I said, "Where are all the names?" The usher said, "That's it." I got up there in that pulpit and I started screaming and yelling. And I said, "If you people of color won't adopt, then I will." And I didn't say people of color obviously. You know what I said (laughs). And I didn't think to--that it was no big deal. Some ghetto priest's gonna adopt, so what. And right after that, that next day, Kup [Irv Kupcinet] heard about it. And he called me and he was thrilled. He said, "Oh I got a scoop." I says, "Scoop? Who cares?" And then to my amazement I started getting all these calls from all the media around Chicago and everything. And then started getting calls from around the country! And then I got this call from [Cardinal] Cody, and he was furious. He said, "You have done a lot of ridiculous things, but this tops it. You are out of your mind. You will not adopt. Priests never have adopted and you're not gonna adopt--." He's screaming and yelling. And I said, "Okay, I won't do it." He slammed the phone down. "Now that's right, you won't." Right after that, foreign press started calling, you know, Der Spiegle in Berlin, Le Monde in Paris and all that. And then that afternoon, the call, L'Osservatore Romano, official Vatican Newspaper. Correspondant said that, Pope John Paul had heard the news. He was very pleased. He wanted to get more reaction from me. Right after I hung up from them, got a call from Cody saying, "We want you to know we're issuing a statement praising your efforts to sensitize the community  about this problem." (laughs) And that's how the whole thing got started. And I didn't have anybody really in mind. But I had a friend who was in charge of (unclear) Home on the North side, a German orphanage. Well used to be German. But he was telling me about how they had this kid over there, Joey, who was incorrigible.  And nobody--And I came over and saw him. And he was a real challenge. And so I took him. And that's how the whole thing got started.
Speaker 1: Now with the adoption, can you--
Speaker 2: By the way I have four now.
Speaker 1: Oh I--one plus three others , that's right. Ages?
Speaker 2: Well they're all--Like all parents I got--.
Speaker 1: Pictures?
Speaker 2: Pictures.  Yeah.  They're all in their late twenties and thirties now. But they--I'm proud of them. You know, they didn't get into any serious trouble, Thank God.  (pulls out photos) Joey, Friday--Friday's from Africa, Stewart and St. Anthony. That was his name before I got him. St. Anthony.  I got them all when they were pre-adolescents, nine, ten years old.
Speaker 1: Now what--Father Clements, the issue of the black community and adoption. What--it's not an issue that has changed much in many--Even since 1981, since you stepped forward.  I don't think.  (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well no. I differ with that. No it has changed. It's changed considerably. Many, many more blacks have adopted. And the adoption has been on the increase. The problem is that the influx of people, of children needing homes has increased. And that's because of two things, one this phenomenon of babies having babies. These thirteen, fourteen year old girls having children. And many of them are up for adoption. And then the other thing about the crack babies. So many of these women having babies have been on dope. So we're adopting more, but the children are coming at a greater rate.
Speaker 1: But could you speak to the reticence that existed?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, a lot of the reticence today is because so many of the people who are involved with the adoption process are white. And who have very little knowledge of the black community. And many times are cold and insensitive and don't know how to talk to black people. And we just need more black adoption workers. We need people who are more in tune with what's going on in the black community.
Speaker 1: And with your founding of 'One Church, One Child,' you were really trying to speak to this issue.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: But speak to it outside of even the Catholic Church.
Speaker 2: Especially, (laughs) the Cath--.
Speaker 1: I know but I'm just saying (laughs).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah (laughs).  No what I said is that the one place that people--where you could find people who really were prepared to listen to this plight would be the church. Because the church is supposed to be a haven for people who really need help. And our Lord said very clearly in Matthew 35:25, he said, "I was hungry and you fed me, was thirsty and you gave me to drink. I was homeless and you took me in." So I feel that's a direct order of our leader. And the church is where people are amenable to that. And once we get a minister or pastor who really is enthused, the church gets enthused. But I didn't wanna come in with any big program. I said, "Let me just say very simply, if we can get one church to find one family that would actually finalize an adoption, we'll leave them alone. That's what we want." Now point of fact, most of the churches did take in more. But if we were able to get this all over the nation we could really lick this problem.
Speaker 1: Now was this the first really, organization you had found--?
Speaker 2: That was the first one.
Speaker 1: You had helped with a lot of organizations.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: (unclear) Renault Robinson, the role you played there.  But you had found--So this was your first time founding. And was that also something--How was--what about the Catholic, you know, the hierarchy and-?
Speaker 2: Well the answer of the hierarchy in general was that we have Catholic Charities. And Catholic Charities is doing a good enough job. We don't need to have you come in with one of your organizations. Now actually after the organization gained momentum, then there were many Catholic Churches that also became--got involved.
Speaker 1: But you were able really to use the press very effectively, you know for--.
Speaker 2: It's a two edged sword (laughs). Press can make you and they can break you.
Speaker 1: But I'm saying on this, you know, this program was really--Right the press can make you or break you. But, you know. But it was a lot of very positive things. This whole thing that, you know, that a priest would step outside and do this.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: You know, and you know and encourage others to move in that direction. And bringing attention to this issue. .
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: So then you--but your-I'm--you actually 100,000 children--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we've had over that. Now it's estimated that it's 135,000 children have found homes through 'One Church, One Child'.

Speaker 1: Renault Robinson and the Afro-American Police League. One night I was listening to the radio. And it was a black station. And they were talking about police brutality. And it hit me that the only group of black men in the city of Chicago who could legitimately carry guns was black police. And I said, "Those are the ones we need on our side." So the guy who was on the program that night was Renault Robinson. So I called him up. And he came over and we talked. And he said, "He was trying to get an organization started of young black cops who'd be sensitive to what's going on in the black community." So that's how the whole thing got started. And I really feel that it was a movement that resonated throughout the country. Because other cities started up after we did. And, of course, they became a real thorn in the side of the police department. Because it's one thing to have some citizen yelling about police brutality and another thing to have a policeman himself doing it.  And that's how it got underway.
Story_ID: 17188
Speaker 1: And 'One Church, One Addict'?
Speaker 2: 'One Church, One Addict' that's an organization wherein we go in and try to find people in churches that would help people who are recovering addicts. And that organization was started primarily because I felt that we got all of these different entities involved. I'm talking about now back in 1992.  You have government, you have educational institutions, you have penal institutions. You just go on and on and on. All of these different--they're all trying to do something about this terrible problem of drugs. The one that wasn't really involved was the church. On hardly any level at all. And, of course I felt I had a vested interest in it. I had put all of these years of my life into the church. And I felt like the church really was ordered to do it by that same scriptural verse that I quoted earlier. Because our Lord said that we must go to the sick. And people who have drugs are sick. We must visit the sick. We must help the sick. So again, taking off from 'One Church, One Child' I said, "Let me start an organization. It's very, very simple. Go into a church. Try to find at least one family that would be willing to come and help one recovering addict. So the whole thing grew from that. And today it's all over the nation. And it's doing reasonably well. And that's how it got started. Then the other one was 'One Church, One Inmate'. And that got started at the Million Man March. When I realized we had all these black men in 1995. And they all wanted to do something. And they really weren't given any specific task to do. So I got up and I said, "Each one of you should go to our jails. Find at least one guy in jail that you are gonna mentor, on a one on one basis. And work through the chaplains in the jails." And that's how that got started.

Julieanna Richardson, interviewer and Scott Stearns, videographer, and Larry Crowe, observer.  And if you could just state your name and spell for it us and give us today's date.
Speaker 2: I am Father George Clements, and that's G-E-O-R-G-E, C-L-E-M-E-N-T-S.  And today is April the 23rd, 2003.
Story_ID: 17190
Speaker 1: You worked with the African American Policemen's League, you know, Association and with Renault Robinson.  And I'd like you to talk about how that even came to be, you know, what role you played?
Speaker 2: At the time that I got involved with the patrolmen's league, which would have been in the mid-'60's [1960s], late '60's [1960s], there was rampant police brutality throughout the city of Chicago, and if not throughout the nation.  And, of course, that was at the time of the great social upheaval too with the sit-in's and the demonstrations and the marches and all that.  And then, of course, too, the death of Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] and Robert Kennedy and Malcolm X and so forth.  So there was a time of tumult.  And I was struck by the fact that we, as a people, black people, were in a certain sense defenseless.  We had no real way of defending ourselves against what was taking place.  And it occurred to me that the only organized group of black men in the nation who could legitimately carry guns were black policemen.  And I got on a radio show, Wesley South, on WVON, and I made that statement.  And I said, "It's just unfortunate that we don't have a group of black police with the guts to come out and really say that they serve and protect, as the motto says of Chicago police, but they serve black people and protect black people, instead of the way it was there, which we serve and protect white people from black people."  And having said that, amazingly enough, that night I got a call from a man by the name of Buzz Palmer, who along with Renault Robinson, had been thinking very seriously about getting a group of, of black police who were socially conscious, getting them together and, and so they met that week at my rectory, which at that time was St. Dorothy, and we moved on from there.  And I met all of these guys, and we had a formal announcement, and I would say this, of all of the things that I have done in the city of Chicago, the one that disturbed the establishment more than anything else was the Afro-American Police League because, even our--the Cardinal at that time, [John] Cardinal Cody, even he was extremely angry about that.  And he called me in, called me on the carpet, one of the many times that I was called in.  And he started screaming and yelling, as was his custom, telling me that, this is absolutely ridiculous and so forth.  And I said, well, "Your Eminence, you see, what we're doing is simply what's been done traditionally in Chicago.  There is the Irish Police Association, the Polish Police Organization, Italian Police Federation, said, and--and, he says yes, and I'm against all of those organizations because what they're doing is they're putting walls around people, and we should instead be breaking down these walls, especially in a sensitive area like the police."  And I said, well, "Your Eminence, if you will recall, not too long ago, you gave the invocation at the annual banquet of the Irish Police Federation," (laughs), and he looked at me and he said, "And there're other things you're doing too that I don't like" (laughs).  And he got off of that quick.  But they had no problem seeing police organize along ethnic lines as long as it wasn't an organization of, of, of blacks.  And, of course, the biggest opposition that was got was from the, someone in the black community itself, particularly, some, some of the other black police because they had really been able to climb up the ladder because of the fact that they were Uncle Tom's (laughs).  And that's the only way they, they could have done it.  As a matter of fact, the first black police sergeant in Chicago was my uncle, and it's kind of interesting there because he found out, through one of the policemen, because at that time, the police department in Chicago, I'm talking about the early '20's [1920s], at that time, it was almost exclusively Irish Catholic.  And he found out that if he became a Catholic, then they would, he could get on the force (laughter).  And he did, and right after that, others too joined the Catholic religion and got on the police force.  And that's, that's such a sad commentary on, you know, the history of, of this city, but that's just the way things were.  So--and at any rate, yes, I was involved with the Afro-American Police League, and I am very proud of that involvement because as a result of what we did, other black police groups sprang up around the nation.  And the first was the Afro-American Police League of Chicago.
Speaker 1: Now, who--your uncle's name, what was his name?
Speaker 2: Alphonse Hagen.
Speaker 1: And he was the first.
Speaker 2: First black police sergeant in the city of Chicago.
Speaker 1: Was that in the nine--was it in the 1920s or later?
Speaker 2: It would have been earlier.  Let's see, that would have been around the teens, around 1915,'16 [1916], somewhere in there.
Speaker 1: Now, can you--I would like you just to spend a little more time on this to talk about the process.  What actually happened because it was a, it was a fight that took some number of years really to do, right?
Speaker 2: You mean the, the league, for it--.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the league, for the league.
Speaker 2: --for it to do what?
Speaker 1: To, to be victorious because it was a long time--(unclear)--?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, well, well, when, when we first started out, there was--.
Speaker 1: It was you--tell me who the key players were?
Speaker 2: Buzz Palmer, Renault Robinson, there were, let's see, Ed Gosha (ph.), who were some of these other guys?  I can't recall all the, the names, but they were--.
Speaker 1: Well, James Montgomery came in later, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he came in later.  But, of course, they were threatened with suspension, with being fired.  They were really under fire, and especially, Renault Robinson who was like the ringleader.  And at one point, as a matter of fact, I guess this is probably the most known incident, Renault came to see me at the rectory.  And he said, "This is so ridiculous.  They got me patrolling the alley behind the police station in downtown Chicago."  And I said, "The alley?"  He said, "Yeah, over on 11th and, and State in that alley between State and Wabash."  And I said," I don't understand.  What do you mean?"  He says, "It's to ridicule me, to make me look foolish."  He says, "'Cause if there's one place that doesn't need patrolling, it's there where police cars are coming and going all the time in the alley back there."  But he said that the commander of the station there, at police headquarters really hated him, a guy by the name of Hayes, and that this was done to make fun of him.  And I said, "Renault, I can't believe they would do this.  I said, they couldn't make a mistake like that."  And he said, "What do you mean mistake?"  I said, "If this is known, I said, this could really blow the police department in Chicago to bits."  And he says, ah, no, you mean--nobody cares about this.  I says, "I'm gonna call Royko."  Now, Mike Royko at that time was probably the most well-known columnist in Chicago.  And I called Mike, and immediately, he said, you're lying.  I said, I, "I don't have any reason to lie."  He said," the police department would not do something this foolish. " I said, they have.  He says, "Look, I'm gonna go down there and check this out myself.  And I, I, I really am gonna expect an apology out of you."  I said, "Go ahead.  Sure enough, he went down there, and there was Renault patrolling the alley.  And Rokyo flipped.  He ran and got photographers, and they took pictures of him.  And he had a big article in his column about this nonsense.  And immediately, of course, Renault was taken off and the police department called a big press conference to announce that it was a mistake and so forth.  But the damage was already done.  And that particular incident, there were stories in China (laughs) and Mexico, all over, you know, Europe and everything because it--the police department was made to look so foolish.
Speaker 1: Did you--in that whole process what do you think were some of the critical steps?  And what was your relationship, you know, with the police at this point because you had, you had already--you said when you had harbored Bobby Rush, you know, people sort of looked the other way, right?  I mean--.
Speaker 2: I was considered an avowed enemy of the Chicago Police Department.  And they play hardball, real hardball.  I got a visit from a police commander--I can tell his name now, he's dead--Harness.  And he told me that there had been--there was, I shouldn't say had been, but there was underway, a process to get me absolutely destroyed in Chicago.  And he said, the only reason that he feels free to tell me about it is because he was retiring.  He said because I--he says he feared for his own safety if this ever came out.  And he said, "But very soon, you're gonna be driving and they're going to stop your car, and they're gonna find narcotics in your car.  And this story's gonna go out all, all over, and you're gonna be ruined."  And I couldn't believe it.  I says, "What?"  He says, yeah, yeah, he says that--this is the, this thing has been concocted.  I know all about it, and he said that it's both black and white cops that are involved.  So I called the Afro-American Police League immediately, and we had a session, lasted all night long.  And out of that we drafted letters to the head of the FBI, to the governor, to the mayor, to the Cardinal, to several, you know, people who really--and we said, we know about this plot, and if and when this takes place, then we want it to be on record that it is an attempt to try and destroy this man.  And, of course, the whole thing dropped then.  But had that taken place, I wouldn't be sitting here now talking to you because there's no way anyone would have believed that I didn't have it, you know, and that would have been it.
Speaker 1: And there were people who wanted to see you gone.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, wanted to see me gone anyway.  So--.
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: That would have been--?
Speaker 1: Sixty nine [1969].
Speaker 2: No, '70's [1970s].  It's about '73 [1973].
Story_ID: 17191
Speaker 1: I'll tell you one that, that set the city on its ear.  As everyone know, on St. Patrick's Day, we dye the river green.  And, you know, Chicago, everybody marches who's Irish and who wish they were Irish and all that stuff, you know.  So one St. Patrick's Day, we decided that we would go to the lagoon in Washington Park and we would put some dye in that, some black dye, to dye the lagoon black.  And, of course, it was parody on what was taking place.  And we alerted the media and everything.  We had more press out there than they had (laughs) for their parade.  And the story was in "Time Magazine", and it was, it was a big, big, big story.  But it just, they were so angry about that, you know, that we would be ridiculing what they were, were, were doing for St. Patrick's Day.  But, yeah, there were several things that we, that we, we did to shake up the establishment.  Once, they had suspended Renault [Robinson], and then they--we had a treaty session, peace session.  There were a lot of us all together down to police headquarters, and we negotiated back and forth, and we finally negotiated to put him back on the force.  So we called a press conference, and the commander at that time was Conless (ph.).  And got this press conference going, and the commander put his arm around Renault, and he said, and "We want everyone to know that we've reached an agreement, and there's going to be peace in the city of Chicago, and we're all--there's only one color, blue.  We don't have any--we're not out here for any particular racial group.  We're all together in this.  Aren't we, Renault?"  And Renault looked at him and smiled, and he said, and we're--"we welcome you back on the force and shook Renault's hand."  And Renault said, "well, I'm really happy to be back here because now I'll be able to get a sal--my salary back, which will allow me to hire these lawyers because we're suing you for $13 million dollars for discrimination," (laughs).  That was, that was this supreme moment of irony and this guy's got his arm around him and everything.  It was, it was beautiful.
Speaker 2: And what would you say about Renault Robinson, you know, your dealings with him and what--you know, him, as a person, because a lot of people, you know, know of the Renault Robinson at the CHA [Chicago Housing Authority], you know, not so much the Renault Robinson from the policeman.
Speaker 1: Right, what I would say of Renault is that he's one of these individuals who is so focused on being fair and just until people really have a great difficulty with him.  You can always deal with people who you feel you can compromise with, that you can maneuver to some extent or you can reach.  But not, not, not Renault.  Renault, once he had made his stand, that was it.  And he would not in any kind of way, diverge from that.
Story_ID: 17192
Speaker 1: At this time, you know, you said--I remember you saying looking at the, in the mirror, you know, after [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.]--.
Speaker 2: And I said I was a clergy prostitute.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  And did that, it seems that just sort of catapulted you over, you know, that you were, you know, falling for the--(unclear)--.
Speaker 2: Well, what it did do--what it did was it, it made me come to grips with who I really should be.  And, and not keep playing these silly games with myself, like Shakespeare says, "to thine own self be true, and it must follow as the night to day; thou canst not then be false to any man".  And so what that did is, it served people--served notice to people that Father Clements really and truly was a black man, you know, that was it.  And, and like, and people, you know, find that kind of thing hard to deal with.  As long as people think they can--you can kind of work with the establishment, then they can go along with you.  Colin Powell's a good example of that.  I mean you can go along, but when you get one of these people who just will not bend, that's, that's kind of hard for most people.
Speaker 1: But the question I have is that, you know, the thing is that you had been going along, you know, and you had very much been, you know--I mean the whole process of your ordination, you know, and (unclear) --.
Speaker 2: Prior to that time, I had played the game, yeah.
Speaker 1: But what, what were the forces?  It couldn't have been--was that--cause a lot of times we arrive at things because there's--.
Speaker 2: It was precisely at the moment on April 4, 1968 when that bullet went through Dr. King's head.  That was the moment.  That really was.  I can pinpoint it to that, because at that time, I could--all I could think about, this man's dead because he was out here really dedicated to his people.  And he was willing to be a martyr, to die for what he believed in.  And, and they killed him.  And, and I just said, I, I don't want to be a phony any more.  I don't want to be that.
Story_ID: 17193
Speaker 1: Were there other comrades sort of in--within the Catholic church, you know, cause there was increasing, I mean in the '60's [1960s], there was increasing, you know, social unrest and people were sort of going their direction.  And I'm just wondering--.
Speaker 2: When you say comrades, you're talking about like other black priests?
Speaker 1: Other black priests or other, you know, white--you know, cause there were also white priests that were engaging in their own (unclear) --?
Speaker 2: Sure, there were, there were others.  There were many others.
Speaker 1: But people that influenced you or that you were, you know, in contact with--?
Speaker 2: Well, there was like a Father Bill Hogan, who certainly took a very adamant stand, and he had to pay the price.  There was Father Morris Rowe who got shot down in Alabama.  He almost died when he was involved in a Civil Rights march down, down there in Haleyville.  There was Father Larry Lucas in New York who, who got thrown in jail many times for his demonstrations.  And so, yeah, there were several of them around, around the country who got involved.
Story_ID: 17194
Speaker 1: The pressure, people like your relationship with [John] Cardinal Cody, you know, that did not ever--you never felt pressured at, to any extent.  I mean you would go--he would call you in, he would chastise you and saying--?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, I was pressured many times.  The Cardinal played hardball too.  Oh, no, he told me many times, well, we're just, you, you're through, that's all.  Just, this is it.  You know, and, I knew he wasn't gonna really do it, but he, he, sure, he tried to see how far he could push me, especially that time when I think--I don't know if I mentioned to you about the shrine that we had for St. Anthony.
Speaker 1: No, but I'd like you to talk about that.
Speaker 2: Well, we had several alters at Holy Angels Church.  And when I first came there, there was an altar to St. Anthony.  And this was not too long after Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] got killed, and I thought, well, I really believe he's a saint, and I think there're a lot o other people who believe he was a saint.  So I'm gonna put up a shrine to Saint Martin Luther King, Jr.  And, of course, the Cardinal was apocalyptic.  He just was furious, and called me in and told me that saints are made by beatification, veneration and finally canonization, a process that takes hundreds of years, and there's no way you're gonna sit up here and make a Protestant minister a saint, and take it down.  And I said, "Well, I'm not about to take it down."  I said, "if you want it down, send somebody out there to take it down.  But I can't vouch for their safety when they're doing it."  And he just, aww, just got, you know, real angry.  But what I was saying was the truth.  There are a lot of people who really do look upon Dr. King as a saint.  And kind ir--a bit of irony, about ten years later, we were having the celebration of the hundredth anniversary of Holy Angels Church, and the Cardinal, of course, was there and everything.  And then, as he and I are marching down the main aisle with all those thousands of people and everything else, he happened to look around, and he saw that shrine.  And he turned to me, and he said, you know, "We were the first ones in the nation to have one of those".  (Laughs)  And we went on in there, you know, he's consummate politician.  There was no, no, no problem.
Speaker 1: But your relationship with him, you were able to handle him.  It was almost--see, this is what I--.
Speaker 2: I knew that he respected the fact that I had what he called intestinal fortitude, that I would not back down because the Cardinal was one of these people who, who fought you, but he liked to think that you had some zest to fight him back, and if you didn't, he would steamroll you.  That's all.  He would have very little respect for you.
Speaker 1: But see, I had never seen that intestinal--I'm saying, up to the point, even when you're describing your youth and everything, that you had followed the thing, and then I see you with the Cardinal playing this sort of cat and mouse game, so adeptly.
Speaker 2: Well, what you, what you got to understand is, if I had displayed any kind of intestinal fortitude like that when I was in the seminary, I wouldn't have become a priest.  There's no way you could have gotten through.  Back then in the '40's [1940s] and the '50's [1950s] they would have said, nigger, are you crazy, you know.  (Laughs)  Nah, they wouldn't let me do any of that stuff.  I knew that in order to get this Roman collar, you had to play the game, and I did.
Story_ID: 17195
Speaker 1: During this period of time, when you're going back and forth, you know, with [John] Cardinal Cody , are there times when you want to just like get rid of your collar and say this is not what I want to do.  I want to really join everyone in the streets.  This is not my platform.  There was none of that.
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, no.  No, I never thought of that because I knew that the moment I got rid of the collar, that's when I got rid of what made me a formidable foe in the first place.  Oh, no, I never, never said, said that.  In fact, I said just the opposite.  I said, here I got these people on the right, the right wing, ultra-conservative Catholics who are telling me, "if you don't like what's going on in our church, get out".  See, you know, if you think we have discrimination and prejudice and bias and all that, why don't you just leave.  And then on the other hand, I have, you know, the, those on the left, the blacker than black, the ones that really are, you know, super black.  And they said, you call yourself a black man, and you stay in that white church with that white Jesus and that white pope and all that.  How in the world can you do that and consider yourself a black man?  And I have said publicly to the right and to the left, ain't going no where--said, it took me twelve long years to get this collar.  I'm not about to give it up.  I said, and you're gonna have to deal with me as long as I'm alive because I'm not gonna give you the satisfaction of getting out.  I'm staying in here, you gonna have to deal with me.
Speaker 1: But this also speaks to the issue of one's faith and one's religious--.
Speaker 2: True--.
Speaker 1: And how the religious bears--(unclear)--.
Speaker 2: --Because I never, see, I always have felt--and to this day I still feel that I am more deeply Catholic than they are.  I mean I, I was put into this church by Jesus Christ, and they're not gonna get me out of here, and I am a, I am a Catholic.  They're the ones that are not Catholic because Catholic means universal, spread all over, for all people.  And they're the ones that are so narrow minded that they think that this religion is just for the Irish or just for the Polish or just for the Italians or Germans.  Nah, nah, nah, I say, this is a religion for everybody, and I, and I--and besides, you know, let's get realistic, there are far more non-white people who are Catholic than white people (laughs), far more, by far.  You know, you start looking at Africa and South Afri--South America, and Asia and so forth, you know.  So I, I just simply say this, yes, I do believe in the Catholic church.  I do believe in it, but I believe in Catholicism.  I don't believe in the American Catholic church.  The American Catholic church is a bastion often of racial supremacy.  They often echo the same kind of nonsense that you hear in so many sectors of America, they echo that.  That's not what I am.  I am a member of a religion that was started by Jesus Christ and has been in effect for 2000 years, and that's where I'm coming from.

Speaker 1: I had the good fortune of being asked by the White House to go on Air Force One to meet the Pope [John Paul II] when he came the United States in 1999.  And I arrived there and found thousands of people at the airport in Lambert Field [St. Louis, Missouri], and the Pope got up to give one of his orations.  So, he's up there talking and every sentence, they would cheer and shout and scream and--everything that he said, and then all of a sudden in the middle of his talk he said, "and let us not forget that we are now in St. Louis, Missouri where the infamous doctrine was officially promulgated by this nation that is called the Dred Scott decision which declared that black people are 60 percent of a human being, and it was a damnable doctrine which cries to heaven for vengeance, and this nation must remember for this they must atone or suffer the eternal damnation from God for calling a whole group of people less than human."  And there was silence, absolute silence.  And then he went on to say--and then they got back into their clapping routine (laughter) because I couldn't wait 'til the next day for the "New York Times" to come out, you know, and little squib in there, just a little tiny, little, little, squib, St. Louis papers too.  They, just a little thing, you know.  But anyhow, that is what really put him over the top as far as I was concerned because I just thought that was a magnificent thing for that man to say.
Speaker 2: But historically, the Catholic religion has been, you know, and it's missionary zeal--did you ever look historically and question it?
Speaker 1: Oh, of course, oh, and question it?  What do you mean by question it?
Speaker 2: And question the, the role that--?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, yeah.  And before we came up here, we had the land and you had the bible.  After you got here now (laughs), we got the bible and you got the land.  Oh, yeah, nah, nah, nah, of course.  You, you can't help but question part of the things that these Spanish missionaries did out in California and so forth, but what I still maintain is that they were doing this as people who were fabricated by the government, by the government of Spain or France or whoever.  These were not people who were acting on behalf of Jesus Christ.  And so that did not--they did not cause my faith to, in any kind of way, crumble or, or disintegrate or anything else because--and they're not that strong.  It would take a lot more than some anecdotes from some of these people down through history who have done terrible things to cause me to my faith.
Speaker 2: But you, you believe in, in many ways that there's not just one religion, that you have chosen Catholicism or--?
Speaker 1: I have chosen Catholicism, but I also believe in a certain sense, over and beyond Catholicism.  I believe in the power of the individual conscience, and I really do believe that God put a conscious into the psyche, into the soul, the heart, the mind, the thought and everything of all of us.  And that conscience tells us what is right and what is wrong.  And we are to follow the dictates of the conscience.  That's my belief.  And I also believe in Catholicism, but I do not believe that Catholicism is the only avenue towards salvation.  I believe that the avenue towards salvation is when one is true to one's conscience, and that's why I quoted that quote from Shakespeare earlier in this interview because I do believe in that "to thine own self be true".  I think that's what's got to happen, and if you're not true to yourself, well, then you're  being false to God, man and everybody else.

Speaker 1: And the recent developments with the church, have they troubled you at all?
Speaker 2: Oh, of course.  Of course, I mean that's been a horrible thing.  There was a time when it was just so unusual to ever hear about any priest doing something, even a peccadillo, but then, now, they'll come out and have a large number of priests actually being accused of sexual impropriety, that is just mind blowing.  And, yes, it hurt me very, very much.  I mean I got a vested interest in this church.  I've put my whole life in it.  I've been a priest forty-five years.  So, of course, it had a, it had a lot of impact on me personally.  But it didn't have the kind of impact that would cause me to say, okay, I want to get out because these jokers did what they did.  And they certainly are not representative of, of, of the priesthood.  They are representative of some very mixed up, screwed up people who caused a lot of harm and who certainly are gonna have to answer to God for it.
Speaker 1: But there are those out there that have said that maybe the Catholic church should allow priests to get married and should allow, you know, the normal things--.
Speaker 2: Well, I think what they don't understand is that there was a period of time for several centuries when priests did get married.  It says right in the scripture about Peter's mother-in-law and so forth.  They've--who was the first Pope.  So that certainly priests have gotten married and I believe--maybe not in my lifetime, but certainly in the future, priests will be getting married because that's not a rule that's what we would call, from--a divine rule.  That's not, that's, that's not one of these rules that cannot be changed.  But that's an ecclesiastical rule.  And, and the church can make a rule like that, and then they can not, not make it.  It's, it's up to the people who run, run the religion, but I do say this, if you are gonna be a part of an organization, then you follow their rules.  And if you don't want to follow their rules, well then get out, you know.
Speaker 1: Well, Father Clements, you didn't follow the rules with adopting Joey.
Speaker 2: I followed my conscience.
Speaker 1: (Laughs)
Speaker 2: I followed my conscience.
Speaker 1: See, see, what you're saying is you have a direct, you have a one-on-one relationship with your God, that--.
Speaker 2: Well, I think all of us do, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I'm not gonna follow somebody who has, who gives me a rule and I don't believe in that rule.  You know, there were, there was a time in this nation when bishops told priests--because bishops believed in America, that they must have segregated schools.  Now, I'm not gonna follow a rule like that.  Just because he's misguided, that's doesn't mean I'm gonna be misguided.

Speaker 1: One church, one child, one church, one addict--.
Speaker 2: -One church--.
Speaker 1: --One inmate.
Speaker 2: One inmate, right.  And where is--we know one church, one child.  So is that still the predominant force or you have moved now more to one church, one addict?
Speaker 1: First of all, we have formed, as of about a year ago, an umbrella, called "One Church, One Family", and that encompasses the three organizations.  We did that for strategic purposes.  It's a lot easier getting funds out of the government when you talk about a family than it is if you're talking about addicts or inmates.  The, and the whole concept of one church started back in 1980.  And at that time, I had been approached by the newly-appointed director of the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, a man by the name of Greg Kohler.  And he had just gotten this job, and he came to see me because he had heard quite a bit about me.  And he told me that one of the top priorities he was going to have in his administration at the Department of Children and Family Services was finding homes for homeless black children.  And I told him--because it was a hot, stuffy day, and I did not want to be involved with some big fat Irishman talking about some new job.  I said, well, "I think that's very wonderful, and Mr. Kohler, you feel free to come back, and I'll be praying for you."  And I got him to the door, and I said, and "I want you to know now, I'll remember you in mass," and just at that point, he said, "Hold it, Father".  He turned around and pointed his finger in my face.  He said, "I want you to know that if you people are not interested in your own children, don't expect us to be."  I said, "No, you hold it, brother.  Come here, sit down", 'cause that man was absolutely right (laughter).  I mean he hit me between the eyes.  And that was when I told him that at Holy Angels, one of the largest black parishes in the nation, that I would hold a gathering to promote black adoptions.  And we were going to have at least four or five hundred people, and we would talk about the need and all that, and, and I thought it'd be a piece of cake.  And I started doing all the different advertising in the bulletin and, and placards up and announcements in church, everything.  And we went through the whole motion that we always do, and then the Sunday before this meeting, I went into the church vestibule and went over to where people had been signing up all these Sundays, and I got this thing off, and I said, you know, it was fifteen names on there.  And so I went up to the head usher, I said, "Where is the list for all the people that are gonna be coming next Thursday?"  And he said, "You got it in your hand."  I said, ah, "Don't play games, come on now (laughs), well, where is the list?"  And he said, "Father, I'm serious, that's it."  I was stunned.  I couldn't believe they were as apathetic as I had been.  I got up in the pulpit and I started screaming and shouting, and I said, okay.  If you people of color won't adopt, then I will.  And you know I didn't people of color, and when I said it, they were all kind of shocked, you know, and all that.  And I didn't think anything of it.  But obviously Cardinal Cody did because he heard the news that night (laughs), and he called me up screaming and yelling.  "You're not gonna do, ah, ah, ah."  I said, "Okay, I won't."  And he slammed the phone down, and that next day, I was stunned.  All of these calls coming in from--not just Chicago, but from media all over the nation.  And then, over, the next day from overseas, from Der Spiegle in Berlin and Le Monde in Paris and all that.  And then that afternoon, I'll never forget, "he call.  That, that's in, in that movie that you, you saw.  And, of course, a correspondent from 'L'Osservatore Romano' , the official Vatican newspaper said the Holy Father had heard the news and he was very pleased, wanted to get more reaction.  And right after [John Cardinal] Cody calls, he says, "we want you to know, we're issuing a statement in which we praise your efforts to sensitive the community about this serious problem", you know and all that.  So that's, that's really how the whole thing got started.  And I knew that, you know, you get your fifteen minutes, and then that's it.  So I thought while this was hot, I'd like to get an organization started that would get churches to find families that would actually adopt a child, and get a gigantic national recruitment.  And that was back in the day before faith-based initiatives was anything, was even in anybody's concept.  But we started doing that, and started off with Illinois, 750 kids were available.  In something like three months, we had whittled it down to fifty, through that problem.  And other states heard about it, and, you know, as of today, cause we've been tracked by the National Black Child Development Institute, as of today, a hundred and thirty-five thousand children have been adopted through "One Church, One Child".  It's one of the biggest recruitment agencies in the nation, you know.  And all you do, it's just a very simple thing, you go into a church, and you say to minister, we'd like to come in and talk to your parish or your church, and if we can find at least one family that's willing to finalize an adoption, then we'll leave you alone.  That's all we want.  And through that little, inch-by-inch thing, but the thing has grown.  Now, today, I don't have nearly as much to do with the organization as I do with the other two because they've become autonomous in these various states.  And they all have their own boards and all that stuff.

Speaker 1: What was it like though, being a parent, when you had not been a parent?  I mean you had a been a parent to a church, okay--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and parishioners.  But it's one thing to think an idea.  It's another to do it.  And I'm--.
Speaker 2: Well, well, first of all, I had to kind of smile when you said that cause I immediately thought about my mother.  My mother's statement when she heard that I had gotten Joey, she says, well, you're the last person I thought I'd get a child from, a grandchild (laughter) from--and she, she was elated, just thrilled, you know, at Joey.  And not only her, but the--my sisters and the rest of the family.  Also the people in the parish, the nuns and the priests and the lay teachers and all that, they all--and, and everybody was kind of, like you just said, they figured I didn't know what I'm doing.  So they got to get in there and really show me what it means to be a parent and all that.  So Joey had too many surrogate parents and all.  But I, the, the whole thing was not foreign to me because my family, my biological family had been like so many black families in that we just took in children.  That was just something that you did, you know, the extended family concept.  And nobody gave you a medal for it or plague or anything.  That's just something that you did because it was the right thing to do, not because some department was gonna be giving you a stipend and pay you for taking in this child and all that.  But you just did it, you know, everybody--in fact, we had a, an expression that you may be familiar called "The Pallet", you know, the pallet is the blanket that you put on the floor and you told people when they came up from the South, you said, you can just lay here 'til times get better or some child in the neighborhood--just come on in, and just put some water in the soup, and, and we got enough for everybody.  And, and I grew up in that kind of atmosphere.  There were always children in our house, children that belonged to somebody.  And I just thought it was the thing everybody was supposed to do.  So I didn't have any problem at all accepting Joey.  Joey had a problem accepting me, you know, cause he was suspicious from the get as to why am I doing this.  First thing he wanted to know, I bet you'll never guess.  First thing that boy wanted to know is how much money you getting for me?  How much, how much are you picking--and I, oh, I hit him right between the eyes.  I said, "zero cent, how about that?  Nothing."  I said, but how much money are you gonna get from me?  "It'll all depend on your behavior, babe, all depend on that.  You do what I say do, you get paid--you don't, there is no allowance.  And one of the first things that he wanted to do with me was, he had this thing of calling me, "man".  "Yeah, okay, man.  Yeah, man. " I said, "I'm not man, I'm your father."  "Okay, man"--either 'man' or 'Jack'.  "Yeah, okay, Jack", you know, cause he was a real street kid.  You know, he thought he had to let me know how tough he was, especially because he, he felt he was gonna teased by the kids for being a priest's son and all that.  So that was when I told him, I said, well, "Every time you do that, that just means that you don't get any allowance."  Now, you--and finally, when he realized how expensive it is, he started calling me father.  But he, he, he--it was very hard for him to really accept my value system, and what I did is--and I did this automatically, I didn't think about it, I perpetrated on Joey all the things that had been done to me by my father.  And my father was one of these guys from Kentucky who took no stuff, didn't talk, just acted, you know, street lights come on, you get your ass in the house.  If you don't, well, then there's consequences.  And we knew that, you know, all that kind of stuff.  And I tried that with Joey, and I found many times, I fell on my face, because he just did not have that kind of affection for me, that I had for my father, and, and that kind of dedication or devotion.  You know, I wouldn't have wanted to, in any kind of way hurt my father's feelings.  Joey thought nothing of saying and doing things to me that I thought were outrageous, and it took a long, long time, matter of fact, that's really how I got my second son, (Pridy?) because I was over in Africa, and I had met this kid who was just the opposite of Joey.  He was kind and considerate and loving and, all this stuff, you know, just so subservient and everything.  And I thought, wow, I'd love to get him to come to Chicago and let him grow up with Joey cause he was about a year younger than Joey.  And I did make arrangements with Nigeria and brought him over to Chicago, and shoot, he, he had to undergo a real--cause I figured through osmosis, you know, some of this would rub off.  But osmosis, of course, works both ways.  But it, it was a, it was a while before we finally got Joey to the point where he realized this--there's certain things that you do and certain things you don't do because there's a certain sense morality, especially when that movie came out.  He was, he was insufferable.  Ah, Joey was awful.  We, I, we would be somewhere, and people would come, "Aren't you Joey?"  Yes.  Now, he's like eleven years old.  "Can we get your autograph," especially if it was some young girl, you know.  "Can I get your autograph?"  Ha (sigh), snatch the pen, hum, you know, like that, I said, (nigger?) you happened to be at the right place at the right time, you know.  You, you know, you ain't done nothing.  And, aww, he was something else, you know.  But gradually we were able to bring him around.
Speaker 1: You had to really deprogram him?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.  And then--
Speaker 1: And how--?
Speaker 2: --when the third one came along, I got him on the Oprah Winfrey, I think I told you about him.
Speaker 1: Right, and his name again?
Speaker 2: Stewart.
Speaker 1: Stewart, okay, and, but you have--there're four--.
Speaker 2: Four, four, and the last one, St. Anthony, he's over in Hawaii.  He was the professional basketball player.
Speaker 1: Now, were you learning things, new things about yourself?
Speaker 2: All the time.
Speaker 1: Okay, but I mean--.
Speaker 2: I learned especially how selfish I am cause the priesthood kind of generates that, you know.  I really valued my privacy, and I didn't want those little Negroes coming in my room after 9:00 o'clock at night cause I, you know, there was certain period in which I wanted peace, rest, you know.  And they just felt nothing of coming in and plopping down in front of my television set and all that.  And, you know, and, of course, they wanted to play all the loud music and do all that stuff.  And I did not want to be bothered.  I really didn't.  And I wound up finally buying them a set and, and telling them, look, you watch it in your own quarters.  And, you know, I would be asleep--trying to sleep and all of a sudden, I'd hear all this noise.  And I'd go out and there they are wrestling and screaming and yelling and all that.  And it, it was a real education for me cause I realized then and there was many a day when I felt like I had made a big mistake.  I really did because I realized then how valuable it is to be able to have peace and quiet.  And, and especially to be away from people who felt they had a right to your time (laughter), your, you know, not that this is something that you're giving them some kind of privilege, but a right, you know.  And, well, I'm going on and on, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, but then, in this whole process, so how do you think it has changed you, I guess is what I'm saying?
Speaker 2: It's made me far more empathetic with parents, realizing what they have to go through.  It's made me really understand, and it's one thing to read all of these theoretical tomes about all that you got to go through in, to develop parenting skills and all that.  It's another thing to be thrust right in the middle of it.  And I realized then as I had those, those people around me--those, those, those kids, I realized what parents have to go through cause parents have no privacy, none.  There's no such thing, you know, the early morning and late at night, you're always being besieged by these people.  And I did travel a lot, and, and in the traveling that's--I, I could guarantee what was gonna happen any time I came back to the rectory cause when I got back, first thing Joey, yaii, yaii (whining), where you been?  You don't tell anybody where you're going.  Yaii, yaii (whining) and what are we supposed to do.  And then Friday, how was your trip?  I hope you enjoyed it.  I hope things went well.  Stewart, what'd you bring me back, and St. Anthony, nothing, just nothing.  And then about a week later, he'd say, you went on a trip (laughter).  You know, that, and that, that was kind of the pattern because they were so totally different.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That's so funny, well, you know, kids can be different, but that's so cute that, you had none, then all of a sudden you have four--.
Speaker 2: A hand full--yeah, I, I often thought about aborting (laughter) the whole thing.
Story_ID: 17200
Speaker 1: The movie, were you pleased with the movie because there are things in, and how--?
Speaker 2: Actually, you know, when I think about that movie, I think about what they wanted to do.  And when I realized what, what they did in comparison to what they wanted to do, it was okay, cause they really wanted to throw in so much Hollywood nonsense, including the romantic interest that I would have and all that stuff, you know, cause their, their whole thing was to make it sell, you know.  But the best thing about the movie is that it did encourage people to adopt, and that's been documented that people all over this nation adopted as a result of that movie.
Speaker 1: How did the movie come about?
Speaker 2: Well, I got a call from Hollywood, from this guy Zeb Braun, telling me that they were interested.  This was about 1985, and he wanted to send some people out to interview me and so forth.  And when they came out, it was right around the time when the church had burned down.  And right away, I saw dollar signs (laughs), you know, and this could be a way of helping to rebuild that church.  So I told them that I would be interested providing that they could sweeten the pot for the rebuilding of the church.  And they agreed to that.  And that's really how it all came about.
Story_ID: 17201
Speaker 1: Now when the church, you know, burned down, was that--what, how did you--I mean that was--?
Speaker 2: I, my whole world crumbled.  I just--that was something that was never in the equation as far as I was concerned; never in my wildest dreams did I think that Holy Angels Church would ever not be there.  For one thing, it was really an architectural gem, you know.  It was a church that seated over 2,400 people cause it had a double balcony, you know, it was huge, Greco-Romanist edifice.  And when that thing was put up by those Irish, they--it was built to last forever, you know.  So I just could not fathom that it had happened, but I also realized that if I did not rebuild it, in all likelihood that whole parish would just evaporate because at that time--kind of ironic when you think about it today, at that time, that was the most--that was the lowest socio-economic area of Chicago.  That was the pits.  I mean down there, nobody wanted to go down, down there, you know, Ida B. Wells, Robert Taylor, Stateway Gardens, Washington Park Homes, Darryl Homes and all that, you know.  We were surrounded by all these housing projects, all these gangs, Black Stones Rangers, Conservative Vice Lords, all, all of this stuff--Jeff Fort, that whole bit, you know.  And it was somewhere that you wanted to be away from, you know, and not that you wanted to be at.  And so I just really felt that if we did not do it, it was not gonna be done because the diocese wasn't gonna put any church up there, and, and with the--the school was in tact.  And the school was still going strong, so I just decided well, and that's what we got to do.  We got to use the mechanism of the school to rebuild the church.
Speaker 1: Did the building either test you or exhaust you or--?
Speaker 2: It exhausted, drained me.  I have no experience in my life that drained me like that because it was so demeaning, you know, to go to these people, and begging for money, constantly begging, people run when they see you, you know, and, oh, here comes Father Clements again.  You know, going to all these different organizations and groups and foundations and just begging, begging, begging all the time.  And that's why when it was--January, I mean I'm sorry, June 9, 1991 was emancipation day for me, freedom.  What did Dr. King [Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.] free at last, free at last (laughter).  We dedicated that church.  I got up in that pulpit, and I said, "You got a wonderful, beautiful church, a church that has made the Guinness Book of Records.  It's the first church in the world to be heated and air conditioned with solar energy.  Bye."  And I left.
Speaker 1: Was the congregation, were they, were they surprised, you think, or did they--?
Speaker 2: They were shocked, they were shocked.  Not just the congregation, but a lot of people in Chicago, cause they felt like I was one of these emperors, you know, and now I've built my Taj Mahal or whatever and, and so I'm gonna sit on it and glory in it, you know, sit on my laurels, you know, and, and all that.  And that was not the--'cause they'd, many--oh, that was one of the things people said, "Oh, you just doing that to, cause you're glorifying yourself, that's all--you, you're doing that out of self satisfaction cause you want, you want to be able to say that you're the pastor of this grand", and I, and I kept telling them that wasn't true.  Nobody believed me.  They believed when I said, "Bye," cause he thought I would be there for the rest of my life.
Story_ID: 17202
Speaker 1: With "One Church, One Family", you see your ministry evolving to what?  I mean why can't the church (unclear) (simultaneously)--.
Speaker 2: I find it--, yeah.
Speaker 1: --this, this project, this venue in a sustained way?
Speaker 2: Okay, let's go back to when I was in the Bahamas and I was telling you about how I had a guilty conscious.  Well, of course, I had already established one--.
Speaker 1: You know, I think because it was off tape, can you talk about the fact that you left and took, can you just--.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I rebuilt the, helped to get the church rebuilt in 1991, and then I went into a monastery for about ten months.  Then I left there, and I went down to the Bahamas, and I took a little small parish down there, Resurrection Church, which was idyllic.  I really, I stayed there for three years, and I honestly enjoyed every moment down there, but I felt twinge, twinges of conscious because I knew that the entire question of substance abuse was getting worse and worse in our nation, particularly with black people.  And I kept a thing in my mind, which one night it just came to me, love the addict, hate the addiction--love the addict, hate the addiction--love the addict, hate the addiction.  And I kept thinking about that, and I finally decided, I can't stay down here like this and knowing what's going on up there, and knowing the good that I've been able to do through "One Church, One Child", and I would like to use that same format to deal with substance abuse and go into a church and find a pastor and some members that are willing to take in people who are addicted, addicts, who are trying to recover, and help them in their re--their recovering, one at a time.  So I came up here, and I wanted it to be a national organization, and that's when I got an office established here and managed to get the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to give us some funds so that we could go on for at least a year, and got a staff together and so forth, and I managed to, to get it off the ground.  Now, almost simultaneously, we had the Million Man March, which was in October 16, 1995.  And at that time, I, I was, and still am, a good friend of Elijah--of, Farrakhan, of Louis Farrakhan, and so I went to him to congratulate him on the upcoming march.  And I just mentioned to him about an idea I had had floating in my mind, similar to One Church, One Child, and One Church, One Addict, and I would call it "One Church, One Inmate", I said, in which I would try to get churches and individuals to--on a one-on-one, help someone who is coming out of jail, help them to find a job or go back to school or whatever.  And he jumps up, and he gets very excited anyway, and he says, "yes, yes, we will do it".  I said, "wait a minute, hold it."  "Yeah, no, we will do it, we must do it."  I said, well, "okay, but I'm not prepared."  "Oh, yes, you must come and make your announcement there, we're gonna do it right there."  And I fought it for a while, but he's a very, very persuasive guy, and so, I did.  I got up that day and made the announcement, and we had over 5,000 men sign up to do just that.  And that's how we got that launched, and, and we got some help from the Justice Department because they're concerned about recidivism.  And that's how the whole thing got started.
Speaker 1: Now, in all of these, whether it's, you know, "One Church, One Child", "One Church, One Addict", "One Church, One Inmate", all three of those really talk to the use of the church to deprogram--.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Which is different than the church is sort of viewed unless you, you know, view confessional as deprogramming, and I just want to ask you from a--I mean, it just strikes me that there're--that's what your path is on right now.  But am I misinterpreting--?
Speaker 2: Well, no, I like what you said about the church as viewed, not as is, because you're right.  As the church is viewed, that is something that is not within its purview, but when you talk about the reality of the church, particularly the Christian church, and you start talking about Jesus Christ, then you have to go back to the stone foundation of why we get involved in these kinds of causes.  And it goes all the way back to the 25th chapter of Matthew, 35th verse, which says "I was hungry, and you fed me; I was thirsty, and you gave me the drink; I was naked and you clothed me; I was sick and you came to me; I was in prison, and you came", and then of course, we say, well Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or naked or sick or in prison or homeless, and he says, as long as you did to one of these, one, one,--very important, as long as you did of one of these, the least of my brethren, you did it to me.  And that is what I feel is the foundation for what I do.  And I'm looking at, always at the fact that you don't go out here trying to save the world or save the United States or the save Washington, D.C. or Anacostia or K Street.  You go out here and you try to save one.  Just get out there and do what you can do for the one.  And that's been the philosophy behind everything that I say as I go around this nation.  And I keep talking about just, just, just go out here and, and get your little one, and if everybody did that, then we, we'd be in good shape.

Speaker 1: Remember how you were talking about Joey, and you said, it was--he, you could not respond, your--the methods that your father had used on you would not work on him because he was not at the same place, and--.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --And never had been--.
Speaker 2: The damage had been done because as pediatricians maintain, the first five years of a human being's life are the most important, cause that shapes your entire, way you look at the future, and whether you're being loved or, or unloved, whether you're being suspicious and wary and crafty and sly or not, you know, or sincere.  All of that comes in, and, and how people have reacted to you during those early years.  And when I got Joey, he was malformed, very much so.  And it took a long time.  And, and a matter of fact, I'm still, to this day, dealing with the damage that was done to Joey when he was a child.  When his mother had him, he's six years old, she took him to the court, went up to the judge, looked at the judge and said, "You take him, I don't want him", and she started running down the aisle, and he's standing there screaming and yelling, "Mama, mama, mama".  To this day, he has a problem with females, especially motherly types, you know, because for a long time, he blamed himself, that there must have been something wrong with him.  That movie that came out, the "Antwone Fisher", powerful movie, powerful movie.  I took Joey to see it, and Joey cried because that movie really kind of sums up where he's coming from.  I don't know if you saw it or not, but it's--.
Speaker 1: I didn't see that.
Speaker 2: --Amazing.  Did you see it?  You know what I'm talking about then, powerful movie.  One of the few movies I've ever been in where at the end of the movie, everybody stood up and applauded (laughter).  It's, it really did, makes a very emotional pull to the person who sees it.

Speaker 1: People would say what is a Catholic priest doing with a black Muslim as a friend?
Speaker 2: And I--sure.
Speaker 1: And tell me what, yeah, tell me--.
Speaker 2: I would say to those people, you ought to be thrilled that this is what's happening because the black priest and the Muslim have one thing very much in common, and that is that they were both created by almighty God, and if there is a love between those two people, that should thrill you.  You should be so happy.  Would you rather they hated each other, that they fought with each other, that they kept old feuds going from history from way back, from people they've never known and who caused all of this generational kind of animosity?  Would you rather have that?  So I would just say to those, those people, how can you question it?  You should, you should be so happy, you should be dancing for joy, if two people who come from different backgrounds all together, whether it's black and white, male, female, whatever it is, if they are joined together.
Speaker 1: What do you think unique about Minister Louis Farrakhan?
Speaker 2: Unique?
Speaker 1: Or what--?
Speaker 2: I would say, what's unique about him is that he's absolutely brilliant.  One of the most brilliant men I've ever met in my life, and he is dedicated to his belief in Islam, and he, I think, feels he's doing what Ala would want him to do.  One thing that I really like about him, appeals to me, is the fact that it's very difficult to get Louis Farrakhan to say anything negative about any black person.  People, people don't really understand that, but as much as he excoriates so many people around, he always draws the line because he says that there's enough vituperation that we heap on each other, let alone that, that comes from outside, and that's--but, but yeah, I, I have a lot of respect for him.  I'm not blind to his drawbacks, but I say this, everybody has 'em.  A matter of fact, what I usually say when people start really criticizes Farrakhan, I say, excuse me, but would you tell me some of the things you're doing? (Laughter) You know, you're cataloging all this, then tell me something you're doing.  You know, let's, let's, let's get real positive.
Speaker 1: And when did the two of you first come together sort of?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: Yes, I remember very, very well.  I met him through--I mentioned to you a little earlier, a priest from New York called Father Larry Lucas.  He wrote a book called "Black Priests, White Church", and Larry introduced me to Farrakhan back in 1959.  Farrakhan at that time was in New York, and he was involved in a mosque in New York.  And Larry was telling about this, this guy that he had met who really had some great ideas.  And we sat down, and we had lunch.  And that's when I first, first met him, and we've carried on our relationship since then.
Speaker 1: And, and at that lunch were there, you know, cause you know how you know that you--there's a chemistry between--?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, chemistry was immediate, immediately--.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that, from the very first time we met, we realized we had so much more in common than we had different.

Speaker 1: What about Dick Gregory, how--when did, when did you meet him, and do you have a favorite Dick Gregory story?
Speaker 2: Ah, I have a lot of Dick Gregory stories, but I don't have enough time to begin to talk about the Dick Gregory stories.  I met Dick when Dick was playing at the Esquire Lounge on 95th Street, which would have been back in 1961.  And at that time, Dick was having a lot of problems with the police department.  And I had been told by one of my police friends that they were really trying to close down the Esquire and that they were gonna do it by raiding it and finding narcotics and stuff, and then they were gonna close the thing down.  And I told Dick about it, and he told the owner, and we were able to get that, to negate that.  And from that time on, we became good friends.  And, and I met, you know, Lil, his wife, and all of his children, and we've just been together in so many, many ways and things that Dick (laughter)--I want to tell you a real recent story.  Dick came to see me in the hospital here in, in Washington, Provident Hospital over there.  And he came one evening, and he stayed about maybe, almost four hours, and he went on and on.  And he gave me a whole array of vitamins and stuff, and, you know, we had a very interesting conversation.  He said, "I'll be back tomorrow."  That was on a Friday.  So that Saturday comes, and he doesn't show up, but Sunday he comes, that evening, and he's with his son, Christian, and he said the reason he didn't come that Saturday is because, he said, I got caught up in a shortwave radio from Africa, some guy who was doing something, and, and he gave him so many good ideas, and he said, he couldn't get himself away from this shortwave radio.  And he was up almost all that night, you know, that Saturday night dealing with that.  And then he had several things to do that Sunday, you know, and he said, he was so glad he was able to get back to see me.  So we're talking about maybe forty-five minutes, and all of a sudden Dick just conked out, just like that, in the middle of a story.  And his son, Christian, got up and shook his father, he says, "Dad, are you tired?  It's time, we'd better go," and Dick opened his eyes, looked at him, he says, "No you the one that's tired."  And he went right back into (laughter) his story.  And he stayed another hour or so, you know.  But Dick is indefatigable.  He's just, he's an amazing man.  Yeah, so--
Speaker 1: Well, you know, when you look--when you think about it, even just mentioning, there're other people that you know and have associations with, but the three, you know, if you look at the three of you together, all very individualistic, all activists, all committed, controversial, all those things, do you see yourself, you know, are--is it going to be the time that generations will not see, you know, the Dick Gregory's or the Father Clement's--.
Speaker 2: Ah, no, I really--.
Speaker 1: Do you see yourself and, and--.
Speaker 2: I, I believe in the lyrics to the song that Louie Armstrong popularized so much, you know, "Wonderful World", and when he dealt--those lyrics are so powerful, he says, "I hear babies cry/ I watch them grow/ they'll learn much more than I'll ever know/ and I say to myself, what a wonderful world."  And I really believe that.  I believe these generations coming along behind us are going to have people that are far bigger than Dick Gregory or George Clements or Farrakhan or any of these people.  I really do.  I believe that the world gets better and better and better.  Now, that's just my belief.

Speaker 1: What do you want to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: My legacy that there were people who were broken and I helped to repair some of the breaks, and that people will come along behind me and decide they want to do the same thing because I believe that to whom much has been given, much will be expected.  And those of us who have been blessed by God with good families, blessed with reasonable education, and blessed with reasonable health, those people really do owe it to those who are broken and who have not had those opportunities, we owe it to them to give of what has been given to us.  And that's, that's really where I'm coming from.
Speaker 1: And your legacy as a, as a Catholic priest?
Speaker 2: That I made the Catholic church make sense to people, especially black people.
Speaker 1: And your legacy as a black man?
Speaker 2: That I was always true to my race.
