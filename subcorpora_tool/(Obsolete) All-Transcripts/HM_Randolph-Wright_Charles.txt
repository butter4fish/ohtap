So I think the wings of eagles I always say or I talk about the image of an eagle is, is something I always think about which we'll talk about later my [maternal] grandmother [Amelia Fagen Lucas] used to say about, but I think it's probably that.
Story_ID: 372997
Speaker 1: So now we are gonna talk about your mother.
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, we'll talk about your mother.  Tell me her name spell her name and tell me when she was born?
Speaker 2: Yes, Ruth Lillian Lucas Wright Johnson now.  So Ruth, R-U-T-H, Lucas L-U-C-A-S, Wright W-R-I-G-H-T, and she remarried, so Johnson J-O-H-N-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay, where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Bennettsville, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Do you know what year?
Speaker 2: Nineteen--what year is this now, wait, let's see, 1930, yes 1930.
Speaker 1: Okay, did your mother share any stories with you about her growing up?
Speaker 2: There are very many stories about the family she was the baby.  And an incredible family at an amazing time in South Carolina because she, she was the daughter of sharecroppers, but all of her brothers and sisters went to college.  They all became teachers; they're all educators.  And just the thing of the-, them--my mom was the one who was the diva of the family which is where I got it from and she was--the, the stories I remember the most are her trying to get out of working.  Her trying to put things 'cause she actually picked cotton.  And I would hear these stories of them picking cotton and her trying to figure out what to put in the bags to make it heavier.  The things of, of, you know, having t-, the responsibility of being the baby and allegedly unable to clean house or wash the dishes or all these things that--she taught me maneuverability.  So the stories that my mother told me I think were these stories about just the family and how she how she maneuvers the family.  But there's this huge family of, of these incredible brothers and sisters who all became these extraordinary educators.  And, and what they, what they did and they obviously they didn't have money, and they were obviously in this small town.  But my grandmother [Amelia Fagen Lucas] especially was a very, very strong influence, her--my mother's father [Julius Lucas] died early.  So and I'm not sure what age but I think my mother was in high school.  So my grandmother really raised all of them and sent them to college.  And it was extraordinary that, that life--both sides of my family have that these extraordinary women and men but especially the women who wouldn't take no for an answer.  And, and coerced their children to become the best they could be and I think that's been passed--it's been passed down for generations.  And it's in you--it's this thing that I say it's, it's in your genes when you get that kind of--.  So the stories from her were really these stories of, you know, walking down these dirt roads and her not wanting to be on these dirt roads saying when does the pavement come, you know, we have to make the pavement come.  And my mom was a real activist I think very early on always going up against the odds, always questioning.  And so the stories of her going into a store and when obviously she was supposed to go in the back part of the store, and she wouldn't go she would go in the front.  I mean, that was always things that she just, she always did that's what she had to do that was it was in her it was no other way around it.  And they always kept trying--I think they finally just gave up on my mom and realized she would never conform and that she had to be this, this person that she became.
Story_ID: 372998
Speaker 1: I need to step back for a minute because I was just so excited to start your interview that I forgot to say that I am Denise Gines the interviewer.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Neculai [Neculai Burghelea] is fine.

Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  My last name is unpronounceable.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 372999
Speaker 1: Your mother [Ruth Lillian Lucas Wright Johnson], what college did she go to?
Speaker 2: She went to South Carolina State College [Colored Normal Industrial Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina; South Carolina State University] in Orangeburg, South Carolina, where she was an English major.  And then she became an English teacher she actually grad-, she went to college at fifteen.  So when she started teaching high school, she was basically the same age as her students.  And it's a, a story of her leaving Bennettsville, South Carolina to go to York, South Carolina, which is the top--this northern part of the state, they call it the Upcountry.  I've now declared it the high country, you know, I wanna give it a new, new label.  But it's the story that she tells of, of driving there, and they got to Rock Hill [South Carolina], which is where Winthrop University is now.  But they got to Rock Hill and she thought that was it they said, no, we still had about ten more miles, and she talks about how they didn't see one car from the time they left Rock Hill 'til my hometown, York.  And then when they get there the mud on this one street because it was a dirt road, and it was raining, and the mud was so bad that my, my grandmother [Amelia Fagen Lucas] said, "You can't, you can't live here you can't stay here."  And then the teacher--there's a woman who brought in the teachers who came to that town and would stay--would teach there would stay with this woman in hometown in that town, this is Ms. White [ph.].  And several teachers had just got--I guess she had two or three teachers a year.  And she got there, and the other teacher was there and, and my, my grandmother was just really upset.  She said, "I don't like where this is," and it turned out they had outdoor plumbing.  And my grandmother said, "I'm taking you back, I'm taking you back."  And my mom said, "No, no I'm supposed to be here."  She knew she was supposed to be there, and that was sort of the beginning of her teaching career.  They did get indoor plumbing eventually at the house (laughter).  And then she met my father [Charles R. Wright, Sr.] there, so that's how I ended up in, in that's how I was born in York, South Carolina, but that's how my mom got there.  I love the image of driving and not seeing one car because now especially these are two, you know, there's the Super Walmart [Walmart Supercenter] and the Super BI-LO, and all these things on the street so I cannot imagine and its four lanes.  So I can imagine now how, how you can drive that distance and not come across another person.  And just the idea of that, that energy and she always talk about that--I just re-, that is so embedded upon her that, that first drive.  You know, to start this life and there's nothing there, you know, there's nothing there which means you have to create it which means which is what I know she did.
Story_ID: 373000
Speaker 1: Let's ask about your [maternal] grandmother 'cause you--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: She was a big part of, of your life. Did you know your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Yes, my grandmother died at ninety-nine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So she was I mean she was just a very extraordinary woman.  She's that ultimate pillar of the church.  And one of the women back even in the day when women weren't in positions of power in the church which they, they still aren't in some cases.  But that's my whole other agenda (laughter).  My grandmother was, you know, head of the deacon board and head of this and all these things.  And she was I--and she really I guess, gave me the foundation of faith I got from my grandmother.  That thing of--I mean because she--it was unwavering, unwavering.  And she always--they used to have meetings, and they would have all these things, and my grandmother would always say four words you talking this is another you say another statement.  And I just realized this 'cause she would always say, love more hate less.  And it's and I just it was this motto with her, love more hate less, and she completely exhibited that.  I mean the people in Bennettsville [South Carolina], where my grandmother lived, I mean she was this icon because of what she represented.  And at that, ultimate thing of being very strict and very open at the same time, open to dreams. Open to two pursuing what one needed to do, but at the same time being very, very strong in faith, strong in family, strong in being, being polite and being attentive.  And being a person you should be--a child about God that you should be that was my grandmother, and she was, she was very funny and very extraordinary woman I mean, so stunning.  I mean, people thought she was my mom because she looked so young, you know, even, even in her nineties.  You would never have known and was very active up until the day she died.  I remembered one New Year's Eve almost twenty years ago she had a fall, and she was like I guess she was in her seventies.  And the doctor said to her 'cause she was going to watchnight service she actually may have been eighty.  And she was going to a watchnight service at her church.  I think she was now--no she was eighty-five I remember now.  And she was going to a watchnight service at her church, and she fell, and they had to take two of her to the hospital.  I'm not sure I think she broke something but anyway she was in the hospital.  And the doctor came to her and he said, you know, "Ms. Lucas [Amelia Fagen Lucas], what happened?  What were you doing out on New Year's Eve?"  And she was--looked at him, and she said, "I was where you should have been, in church," and that's my, that's my grandmother.  She used to call me the eagle 'cause she said I was always flying somewhere she never knew where I was, and she always wanted to find out.  She didn't--so whenever I called her she said, "Where are you eagle?"  And one of her last birthdays I'd gotten on--I 'cause I'm all over the country well all over the world really.  But I was flying to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] for something, and I realize, oh my god, it's my grandmother's birthday, and I haven't called her.  I'd had sent her something, but I hadn't called her.  And it was evening when I was leaving, and I was on the plane, and I thought, I've got a call her now because once I get to L.A., it'd be too late--five-hour flight.  So I called her from the plane, and I called her. And she said, "So where you eagle?"  I said, "Actually I'm in the air," you know.  She said, "You're calling me from the plane?"  I said, "Yes, I'm on the plane I wanted--I couldn't get there without calling you and telling you happy birthday," so I talked to her.  And then my mom [Ruth Lillian Lucas Wright Johnson], when I spoke to her later, said my mom said my grandmother called her and said, "You know Eagle called me from the plane, they let him call me from the plane."  She said, "Has he ever called you from the plane?" That's my grandmother. It was that that that spirit, you know, having grown up in a very oppressive environment, in, in an oppressive area and not letting that overwhelm her.  Not letting that take over knowing that there was so much joy instilling that in her children and her grandchildren and never wavering, never wavering.  I never saw a second of that from her she had this spirit unlike anyone I've ever seen.  And, and it stays with me--I think of so many things that she told me in stories and people.  And people in the family and our ancestors and all the just the fact of, of what you must do.  We have a responsibility we have a responsibility to continue.  A responsibility to celebrate who we are and, you know, from whence we've come.
Story_ID: 373001
Speaker 1: What are some of the stories that she told you about your ancestors?
Speaker 2: Well just she, she talked about I remember--well another thing I was working on a project in Vancouver [Canada] and met a man who's an artist who's a Plains Cree Indian [Native American] artist.  And he said, "I have something I have to show you."  And it was a painting, and it was a black man and a Native American woman, and it was called 'Native'--'Afro Native Love' [ph.].  And the man in the painting looks exactly like me.  And that's how I, I met--I was doing a project, working on a TV show there.  And, and I started talking to him, and he said I can't--we were all in a coffee shop or somewhere I didn't know where I was.  But he said, "I know this sounds ridiculous, but you've got to see this."  And I went to see this painting and it floored me.  And I was at the same time I'd gotten a project at Disney [Walt Disney Pictures, Burbank, California], which was going to be an African American Native American ghost story.  Because my grand-, my father's mother [Maria Vernon Wright] I knew was Cherokee, you know, I, I'd heard them talk about how she was, you know, Cherokee Indian and the whole thing growing up.  And then so, I, I was talking to my mom [Ruth Lillian Lucas Wright Johnson] about it, and I said I'm working on this project.  I'm doing--I got this go ahead to do this project, and I'm writing this story, and I met this, this man who's an Indian in Canada.  And, and he's, you know, it's just opening this whole side of me because I said so many people, especially people of color, have Native American roots.  They have I said every almost every African American family tree has branches that are Native American.  And a lot of us know that, and a lot of us don't, and I never really thought about that history.  And I said to my mom, you know, I really want to come back because my father's mother died when I was young.  And I said I don't know anything about her story about her past I want to find out about that, and I said I really want to know about that.  And then my mom said on the telephone I was in Canada, and she said, "Well, you know, my mom's [Amelia Fagen Lucas] Cherokee too," and I said, "I don't know this.  How, how can I not know this?"  And she said, "Well it's enough trouble being black we didn't need to be Indian too."  So I immediately went home and started talking to my [maternal] grandmother about what that meant and how it felt.  And then I started thinking about it--how she looked she had very, very long straight silver hair.  You know, and her look when you see it you realize of course part of that's there--that it just it had that, that look that I never thought about that was just my grandmother and she, she would talk about her, her father [Thomas Fagen].  And how--I guess her father was very--was--who was Cherokee, looked very white.  You know, compared--but they knew he--they knew he wasn't white, it was that thing.  She, she talked about dichotomies as I'm trying to think to remember this about how he was very, very light but he wasn't--people didn't know where to place him.  You know, is he black is he Indian, they knew he wasn't white.  And its thing of trying to--as a little girl trying to figure out who she was compared to him because she didn't look like him.  And what you do when you don't look like the person that, you know, that's my father, but I don't look like him.  You know, but, but my hair is like him oh wait a minute my nose is like him no, no my, my mouth's like my mom's.  So she, she would talk about that personal--not about things they did.  She would talk about how they looked which is now interesting I never really thought about it.  She told me stories about them, you know, her mom [Jane Fagen] and, and dad 'cause her maiden name was, was Fagen.  And just the--looking different from the other kids or being different but trying to fit in.  And I just remembered that and not much more about them because she really didn't know a lot about her, her parents.  You know, and her parents' parents 'cause that's what I was trying to find out.  Especially now I, I'm upset that I didn't delve more into it.  And get more out of her but it was--f-, and also I think that was something that was painful.  Because a part of it--she wouldn't go into but the main things were about them, them sharing--it's just this look and this energy in them and trying to figure out where they belong because of how they looked, you know.  And which is a hold interesting thing in the African American world anyway about look and who we are.  And hair and texture and complexion and all those things.  So and my family runs the gamut of that from the very light to the v-, as we say blue-black, the very dark.  So it's that energy of where do you fit in because I think she had relatives that they was all the ends of the spectrum.  I think she was she was light, and her sister was dark, and the brother was in the mid-, you know, it's that's whole mixture of those things and what that means.  And that fascinates me I think I dealt with--I deal with color a lot in what I do.  Sometimes not specifically talking about it but, but mention-, having things I will use it in my work.  And people don't really--as I said I don't say it, but people get it, people get the stigma that people have had because of how they look for many different reasons. For all types of things.  And I think she, she--that's the thing that I got a lot from her about just what, what that did and how it made her who she was, and I guess made her have to fight.
Story_ID: 373002
Speaker 1: When thinking about your mother [Ruth Lillian Lucas Wright Johnson], what was it about her that you remember most in your childhood?  I mean, was there something that she might've said to you that has always stuck with you?
Speaker 2: Oh I have so many things.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact the play 'Blue' [Charles Randolph-Wright] that I wrote that [HistoryMaker] Phylicia Rashad starred in, was about my mom, and my mom is completely uncompromising.  She will--she, when I was a kid and first started school she told me, "You bring an A or an F home."  She said, "There is no C in this family. C is average, there is no average."  So you make a statement, you know, you make the ultimate statement, and that's A or F, and I have never forgotten that.  She was an English teacher, so there were always quotes, always quotes she would say, "A man's reach should exceed his grasp, or what's a heaven for?"  And so which I realized years later why I always--there are so many things that I would keep doing and keep trying because the pursuit is far more important than the dream.  And that's the thing that I learned from her so completely.  If you get the dream, that's fantastic, but the pursuit is what's imperative.  You must try because if you don't get that that will lead you to something else, but you have to try you have to do that.
Speaker 1: I read a quote that she said something like--well that you said she gave you the greatest gift--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --of possibility?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Is that (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When I, I remember when 'Blue' opened, and it was the--it was opening night and we all there.  My mom was in the audience.  And I was scared to death first of all because this a pretty scathing portrayal of her because it was uncompromising.  And the thing that I loved is my mom watched it and everyone--half the audience was watching my mother, you know, half the people from the theater.  They're going how is--she going to relate to this to this character?  And I realized then that my mother saw absolutely nothing wrong with this character it was the perfect mother.  You know, with this because of what she gave her child.  And I stood up that night after the show, and I said I just realized that I'm living the life my mother told me I could have.  And she did give me the greatest gift, the greatest gift a parent can give a child is the gift of possibility.  You know, I grew up thinking I could be and do anything that were no limits.  And she and my whole family is like this that we, we had to be believed that we could do whatever we want to.  And it's, it makes you this overachiever, you know, it makes you crazy (laughter).  It, it pushes you to, but it, it allows you, I said, it gives you--it makes you very arrogant, but that arrogance is what allows you to go through doors that are closed to you.  That arrogance is what allows you to realize that yes I am just as a good or I'm better than because you have to be better than to do what we do.  And she--I, I was instilled with that from a child, from the time I was very young.  I mean my mom read 'Macbeth' [William Shakespeare] to me as a baby I mean can you imagine (laughter) that I mean, you know, 'Hamlet' [William Shakespeare].  I mean she--there was no other way that--and she--things have to be my mother this way they have to happen the way she says they should happen.  And it makes everyone around her, you know, it makes us all insane because we have to live up to what she says and does and wants things to be.  But the thing that you realized is she's right, you know, and as much as you fight it, and you're angry 'cause I spent so many years being angry and then I realized she's absolutely right.
Story_ID: 373003
Speaker 1: She gave me something that I, I'm so fortunate, and when you think of people and people who achieve or people who don't.  I always talk about the inner city and how I'm always in these, these different groups, and I talk to kids constantly.  And I spend a lot of time working in education 'cause I think it's very important.  But what's important is that they see me, and that's why I love what you guys are doing with this project because for example I'm on the board of the Roundabout Theatre [Roundabout Theatre Company] in the New York City [New York, New York].  I'm the only person of color on the board. The theater sponsors three schools in the city.  And those schools they're 95 percent children of color and most of the people who go to the school they don't look like them.  So you can pump all the money you want into those schools you can try to revamp it you can change it but until they see something that they can be.  Until they see someone who looks like them, that's going back to my [maternal] grandmother [Amelia Fagen Lucas], who looks like me?  You know, where do I fit in, in this thing of how I look?  Once you--when you realize that, when you have that, that gives you this opportunity.  And I try and do that for these kids saying, you know, look at me.  You know, that TV show that you watch I did that this, this film that you saw, I did that. That makes 'em realize, you know, you can do that too.  Luckily I had a family who did that for me my family demanded that I do that.  There was, there was no--we had no options it was like this is what you must be, this is what you must do.  And when I went in the entertainment industry, you know, they all had a heart attack, so it was that, that thing.  Now (laughter), now it's all right, but then it was that thing 'cause we was, we was supposed to be doctors and lawyers and teachers.  My family are all professionals that's, that's what you're supposed to do.  So the--my mom [Ruth Lillian Lucas Wright Johnson] did give me that gift, that gift of possibility and because of it, I do.  I am what I am because of it I've done, and I continue to fight.  My whole career has been a fight, and it's constant because I'm not supposed to be who I am.  I'm not supposed to have this background of my mother's and father's [Charles R. Wright, Sr.] brothers and sisters having all gone to college.  My having this background--I mean, some of the questions people have asked me over the years, it's just astonishing when you think their arrogance and their energy about who we are.  They think that people of color--African Americans especially are one thing, and we fit into one category.  And we are as many categories as we are colors--we have as many, many desires and dreams and as, as anyone.  And that's the thing that's so disheartening and why I chose to stay and be in this industry because I can change images, I can tell stories.  And that's the greatest thing--so maybe I was fortunate because I got the gift from my mother but I've been very, very fortunate that I've given that gift to others, and that's the greatest thing you can do.
Story_ID: 373004
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your dad (laughter) tell me his name, please spell it for me?
Speaker 2: Charles Wright, W--C-H-A-R-L-E-S, W-R-I-G-H-T, I'm actually a junior.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: So Charles Randolph Wright, Sr. [Charles R. Wright, Sr.], and I'm Charles Randolph Wright, Jr. [HistoryMaker Charles Randolph-Wright].
Speaker 1: And where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in York, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Do you--what year was it?
Speaker 2: Now--early '30s [1930S].  I forgot the exact year I can't remember now '31 [1931], '32 [1932] I think, I've forgotten.
Speaker 1: Okay, well tell me about your dad?
Speaker 2: Yes, well my dad died twenty years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: His my, my father's family, from York, was, was quite--they I guess they're called the, you know, we're the elite family because my family owned the funeral home [Wright Funeral Home, York, South Carolina].  So my great-, I'm trying to now to track all this correctly you have to go to one of the family historians to do it right.  But well I'll do it from the--I started a foundation with my cousins.  It's called the Wright Family Foundation, and there are several of us who we all have this same common ancestor.  There's a story that I remember from a child about my family, and I hadn't thought about it until several years ago when I was actually working on the family tree project.  I'm working on the script, and I named the family Witherspoon and someone asked me, "Why did you choose the name?"  And I said, "Well, actually that should be my last name," and they said, you know, and they glazed, of course.  He said, "What, what do you mean?"  I said, "Well my family was on the Witherspoon plantation in South Carolina," 'cause we've been traced back to, you know, my [paternal] ancestors were all on that plantation.  And old man Witherspoon was this Simon Legree type of plantation owner the one that you typically see that you heard about who, you know, would tell slaves off.  Who is very--was violent, and I guess very mean to the slaves.  Whereas his wife was the exact opposite, allegedly ran the Underground Railroad through the plantation, which he didn't know, taught my ancestors how to read, was the exact opposite.  So here are these two people who were like diametrically opposed.  And my--when Emancipation Proclamation happened, and the slaves took the name of the slave owners, my family said no, and took her maiden name, which was Wright.  So I remember growing up and my family--various family members saying to me, "We chose this name," you know, "You have to make us proud.  You have to do us proud you have--the Wright name is a very special name," you know.  It's appropriate of course that it's Wright (laughter) but it's, and it's being Wright is imperative.  Being Wright is a gift; it's this thing so for many, many years I, of course, as a typical child I rebelled against that.  I didn't wanna be that, I didn't want to have that name, I didn't want to be considered different from other people, or unique, or whatever that was.  And, you know, obviously, as the years go by, I'm so grateful for this extraordinary family that, that I have.  And I didn't know that, you know, my cousins--one is a doctor, one is in finance, one now runs a funeral home, one is a lawyer.  And they--we started this piece together another one is a archivist, and one is a musician.  Everything we have everything in our family to do this--to put together the same type of thing you're doing on a smaller scale.  So we all descended from Isaac Wright and Harriet Wright [ph.].  And just recently, we were back at home and found that we are redoing we're restoring the cemetery, which predates the Civil War.  And, you know, pre-Civil War I mean, slaves were buried on top of each other.  I mean, all these different--so we really we are now trying to re-, we have this property that's in our family that's, you know, there--it was back in the woods.  We never thought about it I mean, it's historic.  So the, the family tradition is imperative.
Story_ID: 373005
Speaker 1: Okay, so we were talking about your [paternal] ancestors and the Wright family.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: It was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Isaac [Isaac Wright] and Harriet [Harriet Wright (ph.)], I wanna--
Speaker 2: Isaac and Harriet, yes, and I mean, you hear about these things growing u-, you hear about your relatives growing up but you really (laughter) pay no attention to it, and it was astonishing.  You know, fifty years later to--for all of us to be stand--these cousins to stand around down in the woods and look at this, this tombstone of, of our ancestors.  These extraordinary people who had businesses, who had their own--you know, they had they had their own companies I mean they were very enterprising in the Carolinas, you know, hundred years ago.  My--Fannie Wright [Fannie Wylie Wright], who was I'm trying to think of all the connections now, but so the, the family funeral home [Wright Funeral Home, York, South Carolina] was started with Fannie and her husband, Isaac [Isaac "Bub" Wright].  And Isaac died of influenza at the turn of the century she had twelve children.  They had twelve children, and she ended up running a funeral home, two farms and raising twelve children by herself, and this was early 1900s.  And so our funeral home is about to turn, you know, a hundred.  And so it's--then it went to Fannie--there was Fannie.  Then it went to Isaac [Isaac N. Wright, Sr.] then it went to now my cousin Isaac [Isaac N. Wright, Jr.], you know.  So everyone--we laughed everyone in my family is called Isaac, Paul, Charles or Robert, you know.  And you go back if you look at the records Isaac, Paul, Charles, Robert, it's just aren't there any other names in our family?  And what's interesting too is to see the--I went back to the records in York County [South Carolina] where we're from and on the rolls, you know, they had the slave rolls.  And you saw the slave markings and all the names, Isaac, Paul, Charles, Robert, et cetera, but they were Withers-, they were Witherspoons because they were listed as Witherspoon.  And right after emancipation, you see these names same names, but they're Wrights.  And, and I, I saw that on, on paper and I just remember standing there to--and I just started weeping.  You know, just that I could almost touch them--that I could--I was so proud of what they had done that they said, no, we're taking a stand even with our name.  You know, our name is important that's what we're doing.  So I spent, you know, these, these generations that, that had this, this business this family business 'cause if you have a family funeral business.  Obviously, you're--it's so different from--I always tell people it's very different from 'Six Feet Under,' the television show that everyone watch.  I say that's the black family that has the funeral home is the elite family, they're the upper-class family.  The, the woman in that family is the arbiter of style a lot of times.  It's this--it's that, that thing of, you know, these kids go to go to great schools, and they get to have this in life allegedly.  You know, but it's, it's an energy that you never ever see.  You don't see that kind of history you don't see that.  So when I wrote 'Blue' [Charles Randolph-Wright] which is about a funeral home family.  It was intentionally showing this elite family, which, you know, critics had trouble with because they said that, you know, family like this doesn't exist.  You know, people like that don't exist.
Story_ID: 373006
Speaker 1: Did your father [Charles R. Wright, Sr.] work in the funeral home [Wright Funeral Home, York, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: No, my father was in construction.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) His father had a construction business. My, my grandfather's brother [Isaac N. Wright, Sr.] was the funeral home.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it's, it's that I always get them all confused because we're all all over the place.  And as my cousin, Roberta [ph.], who you should interview, often say we have all these different branches of the family too that we don't even know about 'cause they--'cause old man Isaac [ph.] allegedly had like two or three families so we're trying to find them (laughter).  As, as this the case, but no my grandfather, my grandfather, Paul Wright, who had a construction business.  And he and my father followed in his footsteps they built probably most of the houses in my hometown [York, South Carolina].  And so it's the different branches my, my father's brother, Paul, who was Paul, Jr. [Paul Wright, Jr. (ph.)] was one of the first black marines.  And, and he just passed, and it was we were, we had been talking to him and trying to get--'cause he didn't want to be interviewed.  And we'd been talking to him some just to find the stories, you know, these, these great stories 'cause all of them had served in like in Korean War and World War II [WWII].  You know, these, these different stories about being in the war and, and coming back home that story that you've heard of course.  And being, feeling like men and then having to come back to this life but luckily my family came back to their own businesses.  My family came back to a funeral home business, a construction business--we--and that's--I grew up with that.  All the people in my--most the people in my hometown I'm related to--we laugh that, you know, everybody in my hometown is a cousin.  And especially they've all come out of the woodwork, you know, when you have a movie come out everybody comes out so (laughter).  They all, they all are there now, but it's great though 'cause I, I tell people I have a whole town behind me it's a very different thing.
Story_ID: 373007
Speaker 1: What were some of the things that your father [Charles R. Wright, Sr.]--did he share any stories about him growing up?
Speaker 2: I think they--it was he again like my--he had four--it's all--about the sisters, there were four.  He had four sisters who were four of the most beautiful women you've ever seen.  I remember as a kid in my grandfather's [Paul Wright] house this mantel with these four pictures of them, and it's them like in, in evening gowns.  I mean it's them there they were so elegant.  And what I remember from him were really about them, talking about his sister's 'cause they one was a chemist.  I mean, they all went off and became these, these extraordinary women.  And I--he talked about them. My, my parents divorced when I was younger.  So I didn't really I didn't spend as much time with him as I did with my grandfather 'cause I lived in my father's hometown [York, South Carolina] even though my parents were divorced.  So I actually spent the most time with my grandfather, and my grandfather had a tracheotomy just before I was born.  So he--I never heard him speak--my other--the other grandkids who were older than me, you know, all they had everyone had trouble I became the translator, which is a story I want to do actually because I became his translator because I never heard him speak.  So I could understand him and now I'm just hearing him I would hear this clapping (clapping), and that's how he would call me.  And I would come, and I would run to him as a little kid.  And he was say something to me, and I would explain to people because he, he owned a lot of property and people always trying to buy it.  He had people renting who were white from him which stunned me which then was a matter of fact.  But I now I realize how incredible it was, and he was this businessman.  So he would have a little pad that he would always write on, you know, and he would write things.  But if I'm around as a kid he would call me--it's no wonder now I'm just realizing that I'm a storyteller.  He would call me because I could understand him and he, he spoke in a whisper.  And he would whisper, and I could, from the whisper, explain to other people 'cause no one could understand it and I could.  And he, he would, he would talk to me because I could, could hear him--he loved fishing, and I would go fishing with him.  And, and he would talk about his dreams now I remember for that town building his town.  That, that, you know, because he was this expert bricklayer, which I guess then was a real thing when, when bricks were--became the thing to use.  And, and he was this expert bricklayer and how all these people wanted him to be this bricklayer but would be stunned when they found out that he went to college.  That he actually had this education and then he could on, on his pad write out these numbers.  And he was very, very quick with numbers.  You know, this, this great mind that I'm just remembering as well that he would--he could just--he could calculate faster than us going in our calculators and figuring out, you know, my cell phone where (laughter) something is.  And, and just his I guess his dreams, his stories were about wanting to change wanting to leave something in that town.  Wanting to have his effect on, on the town that I grew up in, and still so many of the buildings in that town were buildings that he built by hand.
Story_ID: 373008
Speaker 1: I guess as a child I remember fishing with him and him talking about that--how important that it is to leave a legacy and that you have to have a legacy.  And I guess my [paternal] grandmother [Maria Vernon Wright], who died very y-, you know, when I was six.  So I didn't get to know her the way I knew him, but he and I would always just go and talk.  And I just I guess he would just push me to do to do things I mean they all did.  Now that I as I talk to you about it's something where you don't get to talk about your family that extensively especially us.  I just real-, they all--they didn't want to deal with the past.  They didn't, you didn't have to push them to talk about the past.  Now I'm, I'm realizing, you know, you--they didn't want to go into the memories that were negative.  The memories that were bitter and that's the problem with us having these histories.  These old histories because I now--I realize all my stories from him too were about the--were about the future about pushing me to do.  And, you know, what kind of fish this is you should know this, and you should speak languages.  And I mean this is from, you know, this is from this old man [Randolph-Wright's paternal grandfather, Paul Wright] in, in South Carolina in the '60s [1960s] telling me to learn languages.  Telling me to travel, you know, 'cause he had been in the war [World War II, WWII] as well.  And so the, the fact of seeing the world the fact of not--of reading the newspaper--everybody in my family reads constantly.  You know, I grew up with newspapers and magazines everywhere but it still--I mean my mother [Ruth Lillian Lucas Wright Johnson]--when I'm at home, fight over the newspaper--over sections of the newspaper that was instilled not just from my parents but grandparents.  You know, the fact of education constant education and not dwelling on the past.  You know, going--I guess there's a Jewish tradition of what is it, backing into the past.  You know, that you're, that you're seeing, and I think we were the opposite we didn't want to remember the pain of the past.  We wanted to push forward and not forget it but not to dwell on it.
Story_ID: 373009
Speaker 1: How would you describe your father [Charles R. Wright, Sr.], or your [paternal] grandfather?
Speaker 2: My grandfather was magnanimous I mean he was, he wasn't physically large man I mean I think he was smaller than I am now, but he commanded respect from everyone in my hometown [York, South Carolina].  People in my hometown called him Mr. Paul [Paul Wright]--white people called him Mr. Paul this is when I was growing up, '60s [1960s].  And I remember that how what an effect that would have that I be in a place 'cause especially in the South then.  You know, what infuriated me is that you would see an older woman in a store and they would call--you'd see a white woman and it would be Mrs. So-and-So and Ms. So-and-So.  And you'd see someone black, and they would just call her by her name, you know, Ethel Ruth [ph.], Lillian, you know, whatever they call her by her name.  And again my mother [Ruth Lillian Lucas Wright Johnson] would never allow that my mother would force them to call--if, if they if someone--I remember just always cringing as a child because if someone said her name, then she would go into this tirade.  She refused for them not to acknowledge her, but now going back to my grandfather, who's my father's father, that he commanded this respect from people.  Because well they needed what he provided they knew that he was--his mind they knew how smart he was and that that nothing could get by him.  And also, you know, within the family also having the funeral home business [Wright Funeral Home, York, South Carolina] in the family which is another business.  So there was several businesses that his brothers and sisters had.  And it--the men and women had these businesses it weren't just men it was--so I always grew up with very strong women who had their own business.  Who weren't just homemakers, you know, women who had businesses as well.  So there was both seeing that seeing both of them and what, what an effect that it as a kid to have that kind of family structure now that I realized it.  That they were very, very strong in what they did and respected and demanded and commanded that respect.  I guess that's the thing I remember the most--that that especially from my grandfather, and he spoiled his kids.  You know, my, my father and his brothers and sisters were completely spoiled by him and got everything they wanted and in some instances that wasn't a good thing.  But he was, he was an extraordinary figure in my hometown not just, you know, not just in the family but in the entire town.
Story_ID: 373010
Speaker 1: Okay, so as we move on to you.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) You--but, before we do that tell me how your mother [Ruth Lillian Lucas Wright Johnson] and father [Charles R. Wright, Sr.] met?
Speaker 2: My mom was teaching, you know, it was that dirt road again.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother was teaching in--had moved to York, South Carolina and was the young pretty English teacher.  And my father was--I guess the, you know, the available Wright--I mean, he was a Wright.  So, again there you go--I'm sure when she got there they probably told them that, you know, oh you have to (laughter), you have to snatch one of the Wrights, and my mom was stunning and did.  And, and again it's interesting 'cause my mother was the dark sister, and--of her sisters.  And I, I remember going--I remember my aunts, my father's sisters when I was young telling me not to bring a dar-, dark girl in the family.  I remember that energy and thinking well look at my mother, you know, look at my cousin's mother.  You know, what, what is that?  That, that kind of prejudice that kind of, you know, inward racism.  Because they thought, you know, oh you'll get--if, if you're light you'll be more successful.  If you, you know, if, if you have certain things you're be more successful.  Again is that that color thing of how you look and what that was and everyone in my family rebelled completely from every side of it.  So, I mean the family is so mixed you can't tell what it is, but I, I do remember young as a young kid them saying that.  And, and being aware and offended by it because of where, what I knew already, you know, what I knew with, with my mom who, who is stunning.  So anyway but that that's a diversion, a color diversion, but my mother and father met, you know, in York.  I don't know exactly how, but they're only, you know, two people in the city (laughter).  So and, and my mother ended up becoming a Wright, and I'm an only child.  So, you know, which is interesting with my mother and father most of their brothers and sisters had only one or two children.  And they both came from huge families, and they all ended up just having only children or two, you know.
Story_ID: 373011
Speaker 1: Being an only child, you spent a lot of time with your cousins?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my cousins were like brothers and sisters to me and still are.  So, even though, you know, a lot of people when you're isolated as an only child I think I had the best of both worlds because I had them around me.  And we were in the neighborhood, and we were--so I had family around me.  But then I could go, but then I could go home and have all the stuff to myself (laughter), and I didn't have to share it.  So but I, I did--was very, very aware of family because I have a large extended family.
Speaker 1: What were holidays like in your family?
Speaker 2: Holidays--everyone, you know, everyone came together typically Thanksgiving, well I guess Thanksgiving and Christmas we would go to my mom's [Ruth Lillian Lucas Wright Johnson] too.  So we were in both we were in both places we would share.  And there were two distinct worlds, you know, my [maternal] grandmother's [Amelia Fagen Lucas] world was very, very Baptist.  And, you know, we would be in church all night and, you know, it was that.  And my mother's chur-, my, my hometown that I grew up in we were at Wesley United Methodist Church [York, South Carolina].  So we were very saddity is such a great word--people don't use anymore but it's--we were very, very upwardly mobile but as I described my family I say we were upwardly dysfunctional.  So (laughter) it's that, that so I had very distinct worlds of the real gospel, that southern gospel background.  That Southern Baptist background with my grandmother who would spend weeks preparing these meals that were extraordinary.  And her and that whole family coming together and then my other family and so we would be there.  And then now I'm thinking about my father's [Charles R. Wright, Sr.] family 'cause by, by the time I was ten or twelve we--they'd divorced.  So I will spend time with my father's family 'cause my [paternal] grandfather [Paul Wright] was across the street.  They were next door we were all around but, but my mother does not cook.  So--which is also a part of 'Blue' [Charles Randolph-Wright]. And people kept saying oh you made this up, and I was like no.  I mean, she, you know, she (laughter) my mother would say there's a line in 'Blue' which epitomizes my family and my mother especially 'cause she says, "Never do something yourself that you can pay someone else to do."  And so it's those opposite worlds of getting people to do things in one environment.  And having this other environment of that--the classic family to so, I had really both worlds that that almost I mean we--it was a very small town, but it was a very New York [New York]--living here especially, I've always wanted to be in New York 'cause it was a very New York kind of energy of ordering out, of having it done for you.  Of, of I have too many other things to do then to worry about this.  I have, I have, and my family is very political, so I grew up in the civil rights in the civil rights era.  And the marchings and, and all of those things too so we didn't have time to, to have these great family dinners.  We had to go out and protect, we had to go and, and drive to some other function, you know.  So those were--when you talk about holidays now I think they were very distinct and very different and both sides of it.  And, and both sides I, I like both sides it, it--they both inform e- they inform each other.
Story_ID: 373012
Speaker 1: Well I know that your family was very affluent.  What was the makeup of the community of, of York [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: York is maybe a third African American perhaps I'm not sure I think a fourth to a third African American.  There were three books written in the '50s [1950s] one called the 'Blackways of Kent' [Hylan Lewis] the 'Richways of Kent' [sic. 'Townways of Kent,' Ralph C. Patrick, Jr.] and the 'Millways of Kent' [John Kenneth Morland].  These three sociologists came to my hometown and wrote about the town.
Speaker 1: Did they actually stay with your family?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And, and Hylan Lewis was this sociologist who stayed with my family.  And there's actually a film--they actually filmed part of this that's in, in [U.S.] Congress.  The Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.] that we're trying to get copies of, but they documented what the life was like for these three different, very disparate communities.  The poor, middle community the, the rich community and then the black community.  And they were very distinct because this was a mill town, so it's a very poor town but you had the owners who had the money.  So you had a very small group of people of, of white people who I guess who were affluent or the quote unquote elite--if you can use the elite--in my hometown [York, South Carolina].  But and then the black but, you know, as, as even though we were considered affluent.  I mean we were all black, so you didn't--I never had that in my head that distinction.  I mean, I knew that we were quote unquote the Wrights.  And we were--we had certain opportunities that other people didn't have, and I was aware that.  But I mean, we were all still--that didn't help me go swim in the pool that didn't allow, you know, black people to swim in the pools until I was fifteen.  I remember separate bathrooms in my hometown, you know, and people go how that's impossible--no I do, I do I remember all those things.  I remember, you know, the name calling.  And I remember crosses burning and, and, all of those images I, I have in my lifetime from my hometown.  And so I guess the--it--but it's a very it's a poor community.  It's a middle community just to look at it overall.  That would be, you know, that's the description you have people where they have certain things, but I would think of it as a textile mill oriented community.
Story_ID: 373013
Speaker 1: How old were you when they came to the town to do the study?
Speaker 2: They--I don't think I wa-, they did it before I was born.
Speaker 1: Before you was born.
Speaker 2: They did it before I was born.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And a story--there's a woman named Ione [Carole Ione Lewis]. Have you interviewed her? Do you know who she is, Carole Ione? You must interview.  Carole Ione I met, I was in the original company of 'Dreamgirls.'  I was doing a show--another show with--late at night with a woman from--named Camille Saviola, who's in the show 'Nine' ['Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'] next door to us, and she said, "Oh you must meet my friend Carole."  And I did, and it turns out that Carole had written this book about her family and had relatives in South Carolina.  And all these things we had all these different connections and there is a, a state justice in the Supreme Court [South Carolina Supreme Court] named Jonathan J. Wright in South Carolina that we've been trying to trace because we think he's a part of our family.  But we've lost this family connection, you know, it stopped at a certain point, but we think he's our family.  And she had written--I was reading this, this play originally she had written it as a play.  And there was a section where her great-grandmother was talking to Jonathan J. Wright, who was this person that I was thinking was my ancestor or trying to figure out if he really is, but someone that I knew.  And I told her oh my god this is--my family are the Wrights from South Carolina.  So we started talking about this and just different connections.  And we had all these things in common, and I started working with her, I said I've got to work with you.  And it turned out that her father was Hylan Lewis, the sociologist who had come to my hometown and stayed with, you know, my family.  And, and he was still alive then so I actually never got to meet him, but we got--they were all in touch.  And, and Carole did a book called 'Pride of Family' ['Pride of Family: Four Generations of American Women of Color,' Carole Ione], and this book was about these generations of women in her family and which could be my family, but we had that connection with her father and my cousin Roberta [ph.].  Part of something that we want to do with the Wright Family Foundation is to take that book and to re-, and to 'cause she's, she's adamant about that book.  About getting that back out there because of how the way he told the story of the people.  And it was called the 'Blackways of Kent' [Hylan Lewis].  And years later when I wrote 'Blue' [Charles Randolph-Wright] I didn't want it to be York [South Carolina], my hometown.  But it was my hometown--so I named it Kent because of that.  And ironically before I even did this for no reason I don't know why I chose that name the family last name is Clark (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Clark.
Speaker 2: Right, and so I'm working on it, and I went oh my God (laughter) these are the Clarks of Kent (laughter).   How perfect we are this superfamily it is Superman this is ideal this is ideal.  So everything so everything is, is providence, you know, it's in divine order.  But I didn't--I wasn't--maybe I was just born, but I know it was '50 [1950].  So I think it was before I was born, but as I grew up, I remember them talking about him coming there and him interviewing everybody.  And then no I--then I also remember a book came out and my cousin saying oh that's us.  And showing parts of the book that was, you know, and that's your cousin.  And that's your uncle, and you're, you know, that's your father and because it was different names in the book, but 'Blackways of Kent' it was--and, and 'Millways of Kent' [John Kenneth Morland].  And I don't know if 'Richways of Kent' [sic. 'Townways of Kent,' Ralph C. Patrick, Jr.] actually ever came out, but it was the--it was this really--I guess lauded social documentary of, of my hometown.  And it was in which it got a lot of attention and people have, you know, talked about it ever since.  So, we really want to try and bring it back and maybe reissue it or, you know, do something through the foundation because it's our family.  And it stayed with us and then as I said you keep having and constantly I have these connections with people like that.  When you meet people that, you know, oh, you know, my, my cousin was this and that I mean it's, it's, it's amazing.
Story_ID: 373014
Speaker 1: Now we're gonna go back to you--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --as a young child. Now think about maybe some sounds I'm trying to take it back to your childhood some sounds--
Speaker 2: Railroad.
Speaker 1: --some smells--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --somebody cooking other than your mother [Ruth Lillian Lucas Wright Johnson] (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes (laughter).
Speaker 1: And some sights of those three things what takes you back to your childhood?
Speaker 2: Soon as you said that--railroad I think of the railroad tracks I think of hearing the train whistle at a certain time.  And, and knowing cause the, the train ran right in front of the funeral home [Wright Funeral Home, York, South Carolina].  And, and the sound of the, of whatever you call those--you know.  Well, it's not turnstiles, whatever the--what do you call those things? I can't even think (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  (Simultaneous) (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Barriers, I guess, whatever those--the sounds of the barriers coming down and, and the clicking and just that, that's the first thing when you said that, that just--I just so clearly remember that and the whole idea of railroad tracks anyway in the South, how they divide us.  How the communities are divided by that and, you know, we were right at those, those tracks.  And--which now are paved over that train doesn't come through there anymore.  So what that means, you know, I was saying I wanna put there's a corner right there I wanna put a Starbucks on that corner that's my, that's my (laughter)--that, that corner where the railroad tracks where I wanna put that there.  So I remember that. I remember south honeysuckle; I remember that smell that is such a distinct smell.  I remember the sound of crickets only 'cause it's so quiet at night, you know, I just did hear crickets.  You know, that, that would make you go to sleep.  You know, that that's such a--the buzz Ju-, what we call June bug lightning bugs.  No June bugs are different, June bugs had a real buzzing sound the idea of lightning bugs at night seeing them.  I don't think I've ever seen a lightning bug up here [New York, New York], you know, that's sound.  Smells, there so many smells from like all of the different--my godmother was an amazing, amazing cook.  So that's why my mom didn't cook because my godmother made every birthday cake I ever had.  And walking into her house and always having every--it was always a cake it was always that that pound cake smell.  I hate that with the South when I was laughing before about the chicken it's fried chicken and pound cake.  That's the thing I can, I will smell that for the rest of my life.
Story_ID: 373015
Speaker 1: So we were just talking about sounds and sights.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you were telling us the different sounds and sights, but we just wanna go back a little bit to talk about the Indian [Native American] in your family that you have traced through (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: And we talked about different Indians, so--
Speaker 2: Right.  Well, my grandmother--my father's [Charles R. Wright, Sr.] mother, Maria Vernon Wright was her name.  And I remember always too that, that song it was that, that 'They Called the Wind Maria' that song and I--when I first heard that as a little kid that, that was my grandmother.  And it's a vague well my most distinct memory is that my grandmother died the sa-, the day before or the day after that Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was shot.  So and as this kid because that effect of, of death even though and I tell people, you know, death is a part of my--it's the family business.  So I deal with it in a way differently from, from people.   I mean death has always been around, around because that's what we did.  But when she di-, when my grandmother died, and Kennedy died it was this it was devastating.  I, I remember as, as a six year-old, a five or six year-old going into this deep depression.  You know, not understanding and also, my mom's [Ruth Lillian Lucas Wright Johnson] sister died around like a few days later.  So I remember these three, these three people who were, you know, two relatives and then this figure, our president.  You know, who was such a president for us, you know, we felt--having that happen, and that was such a, a devastating thing.  As a child though I never knew anything about my Maria's background.  I would hear people say she was an Indian because just of her look, you know.  And I would hear that once in a while, but I never knew what that was I've heard different things growing up.  But then as I started to research it I mean, I, I found out she had a background that was of Cherokee and Catawba.  The Catawba Indians were right around South, South Carolina and North Carolina it's right on that--in that little border area there.  And I think now that there's this whole thing happening of trying to get a casino and, you know, all these different things and the tribal records, but she was--she actually came from Spartanburg, South Carolina.  I know that there are relative-, other relatives in that area as well.  And I'm not sure of, you know, I never knew the full background.  But I know that there was there was this mixture of Catawba and Cherokee and black that I, I kept hearing about, you know.  And I never--my, my other grandmother my mother's mother, Amelia [Amelia Fagen Lucas], that was the Cherokee background that she talked about her father being Cherokee.  But my, my grandmother Maria talked about--she never talked about it, but my grandmother Maria was, I think Catawba and Cherokee so. And, and which I'm really interested in finding out more about the Catawba Indians as well just from that because this such a part of, of that area--York County [South Carolina], Lancaster County [South Carolina], you know, that whole thing.

Speaker 1: Tell me about elementary school, what was the name of the school you went to?
Speaker 2: Jefferson Elementary [Jefferson Elementary School, York, South Carolina], which was actually named for Jefferson Street that it was on.  I kept thinking who was this, is it [President] Thomas Jefferson, is it--but I think it was because of the street.  And Jefferson Street it, it--my elementary school was all-black this was schools were still segregated and--
Speaker 1: What year was this?
Speaker 2: Well, I (laughter) what year did I go to school '62 [1962] I started elementary school I guess '62 [1962], '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay and it was--you said it was an all-black school?
Speaker 2: All-black school very--I mean everyone knew everyone else it was a small school.  York [South Carolina], there were other communities around York, Hickory Grove [South Carolina], Sharon [South Carolina] I mean, different places we all knew each other.  But, but Jefferson was the elementary school that was right in the heart of the--excuse me one of the black areas of town.  And, you know, cross the railroad tracks and down that, that dirt road it's literally the elementary school was literally three houses down from where my mother [Ruth Lillian Lucas Wright Johnson] first stayed.  So the teacher [Ms. White (ph.)] that--the woman that she stayed with, the house that house faced the high school where my mother taught.  So the elementary--there was an elementary school, a football field and then the, then the high school, and then they were all in this little area there.  So Jefferson Elementary and as I said it was all-black, very close-knit.  I remember all the teachers, I remember the people there.  I remember how, you know, and especially because my mother was a teacher it was very--my mother taught English in the high school.  So it was very difficult to get away with anything because, you know, A, I was a Wright, B, I was a teacher's kid, you know, which is, which is just under being a preacher's [Randolph-Wright's father, Charles R. Wright, Sr.] kid which is the worst.  A teacher's kid is bad especially if your there I mean, luckily I was never in my mother's class.  I was like don't put me in my mother's class, and she was like don't put him in my--we were both adamant about not having that happen.  I regret part of it because my mother was a brilliant teacher and I regret, but I had that, you know, I had that my whole life.  So I thought okay, and my mother still corrects what I do.  I'll send her a script, and she'll, she'll correct it, you know.  But Jefferson Elementary was very tight-knit because it was all-black, it was small everyone knew each other.  I remember the activities, I remember all the--especially being an artist now how much we had music in the school.  We had art in the school we had all these things that the kids don't have now.  We had so much--there was so much more opportunity in a way then than now.  And it's something again I was I had a conversation a few days ago about segregation and what happened when, when things be-, when schools became desegregated.  You know, what we lost because I mean there were a tremendous gain in, in certain things but we lost a lot of things.  We lost our leaders; we lost certain things in communities.  And businesses in communities because all those leaders those Talented Tenth that Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois] called it.  Those leaders ended up going into these white companies and ended up, you know, getting stuck in the glass ceiling.  And so they don't run those companies and had they stayed in this segregated environment they would've had these companies.  So I've, I've always talked about that because I experienced what it was like to have theses segregated worlds and these segregated businesses.  And, and how productive it was, how important it was to the community.  How everyone took care of everyone else 'cause we don't do that anymore.  And it was--I--that's what I remember about elementary school--
Story_ID: 373017
Speaker 1: And also having a-, so much art around me that I had no--and, and that's what I loved.  You know, obviously academically, academically I was geared to do that.  But I have a lot of art that appealed to me that I got to, you know, that May Day we would do this whole thing, and all the classes would dance.  And, and we would wrap the Maypole on May Day.  I mean what, what where's that from I mean what, you know, how European can you be, right.  But we had all these traditions that we did in school that were a real part of, of that environment that also made me who I am and what I do.  And just thinking about May Day just now that just bring so much back to me because you would plan four months your class' dance.  Each class had to do a dance and what that was, and you get to research it.  And the costumes I mean it was really intricate the theater of it all no wonder I'm, I'm in this business.  I mean it was a lot--we had a lot of theater.  We had a lot of, of, of performance, especially regarding black history.  Constantly told stories of, of, you know, people of color who made a difference.  And that we could make that difference, you know, obviously, my mom [Ruth Lillian Lucas Wright Johnson] and other people in my family being right there pushing that as well.  But I, I remember that from elementary school [Jefferson Elementary School, York, South Carolina] especially.
Speaker 2: Was there a particular teacher that might've encouraged you or someone that you just looked up to?
Speaker 1: I, I mean I had--I remember my first-grade teacher Ms., Ms. Kershaw [ph.] especially who ended up being my next-door neighbor was like family definitely her.  Ms. Quinn [ph.] was my fourth-grade teacher who was my second mother, who lived on the other side of us and probably was the most influential.  I think of all of them because she was--besides this teacher she was, she was--I never was taught by my mom.  So this was the mom that taught me. So I think especially her and many I remember so many--these other teachers they were all very, very influential.  I started playing instruments in, in elementary school so obviously being part of, of the band was a huge thing for me.  And I actually got in the high school band when I was in elementary school.
Speaker 2: What did you play?
Speaker 1: I played trumpet.  And the, the band teacher, Ms. Craddick [ph.], I remember all of these different these names.  I haven't thought about them in, in forty years but they, they were all so supportive and at the same time as I said about my mom being uncompromising.  I think they all were that they, they knew the, the journey or the struggle that was ahead and were--prepared us for it.  You know, and if we listen and if we, we took what they told us and then and rose to that challenge we were able to do certain things.  And I that's what I remember about that, that school especially.
Story_ID: 373018
Speaker 1: You said your, your family expected you to do well as a student academically (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --and you did, but what kind of child were you?  I mean, did you get into mischief did you get a whooping (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay.  I did.  I was very inquisitive I remember my [paternal] grandmother got a new stove.  Oh my god, my grandmother got a new stove I wasn't in school yet okay, so I had to be I stayed with my grandmother, Maria [Maria Vernon Wright].  I think she was before I went to elementary [Jefferson Elementary School, York, South Carolina] and nursery school.  She--I would stay with her, and she got a new stove, and I think a burner.  I remember there were these the burner as opposed to gas or what I don't know.  I'm just thinking now at this, but anyway, I remember this new stove.  And I was fascinated by it, and I had eaten a Big Time candy bar, and there was a little, a little cardboard piece in the candy bar.  And I had this piece of cardboard, and I said, I want to see how fast this will burn this.  So I turned on the stove 'cause it's it was right you had to push a button instead of turning it.  It's like this was the new invention and, and we had to get everything brand new, you know.  And I remember turning on that stove putting that card to it and seeing the card burn and thinking this is fascinating.  And then as it started burning more--what do I do with this?  And I threw it in the trash can and just continued on as if nothing happened.  Needless to say, I think that--I remember this completely because that's probably the biggest--it was like of communal whipping from, you know, and not a whipping, it was a whopping, from my grandmother and [paternal] grandfather [Paul Wright].  And father [Charles R. Wright, Sr.] and my--I mean everyone participated in that one 'cause I could've burnt their house down.  You know, but I, I always wanted to know how things worked.  I always wanted to know--I was the kid who would take things apart to see how they, you know, how did that, did that work.  I was also the kid who was always putting on having put on a show.  Let's put on a show let's do this I, I--all the cousins would come from, you know, the northern cousins, you know, who thought they were better than us would come down (laughter).  And, and we would all have the competition, and, and we would do little shows out in the, in the backyard of my grandfather's house.  And my aunts would sit around drinking gin and orange juice.  So when Snoop Dogg come out with that ['Gin and Juice'], I would scream 'cause that they would all be sitting there drinking gin and orange juice and on the backyard.  And I would organize everything, I was always the organizer, you know, in the book 'The Tipping Point' ['The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference,' Malcolm Gladwell] he talks about connectors I was the connector, you know.  And I know as a child I did that, but I think I was very--my mother [Ruth Lillian Lucas Wright Johnson] instilled the wrath of God and me.  So I was respectful I mean I was very precocious, but I don't remember--I don't think I was a bad kid.  I think I was I was enterprising, you know.  I did things I was not supposed to do, but I found creative ways to do it and not have them know.  And it's, it's interesting 'cause my friends--I didn't--my friends was the kids from the like the bad families.  Those were my good friends, and I'm still (laughter) friends with them like that the kids were like me the, the sons of and daughters of teachers or the other--the elite, you know, those elite families I didn't want to be around them.  I was with the other kids, so I've always found a way to, to mingle.  I wanted to be around everybody I didn't want--I, I never felt, and I've always felt like this I didn't want to fit just in one group.  I didn't want to just belong to oh okay this your family group or this is your intellectual group or your music group.  Whatever it was, I always found a way to be in every, every group at once.  And every person I was with thought I was--that's who I was, you know.  And then I'd leave that group and go to the next.  So I was, I was around that and, and loved being around all these different types.  And it's, it's great now to go home 'cause I see all of these people that I grew up with, and they just laugh 'cause they say I'm the exact same way (laughter) that I always was.  But I, I really enjoyed them I really enjoyed the mixture of people that that were around me.  And how we fed each other, you know, just like my best friend from home his family loved the fact that his, his best friend was a Wright, right.  Whereas I was the one that got him in trouble, you know, I was the one who was causing the trouble not him (laughter) you know.  But it was that it was that kind of, of, of life.  So that, that's what I, I remember about so as a kid I think I--obviously precocious trying to organize and control everything, you know, which was in my genes (laughter).
Story_ID: 373019
Speaker 1: So I know your, your grandmo-, or your family was very religious, and they were Baptists, so did you have to go to church every Sunday?
Speaker 2: My mother's--I mean my mother's [Ruth Lillian Lucas Wright Johnson] family in Bennettsville [South Carolina] that was the Baptist family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The family where I grew up in, in South Carolina was the Methodist family.  So they were the upscale, you know, they didn't shout.  They didn't say, "Amen," you know, if they said that it was at the end of a hymn or very softly.  We didn't have, you know, we didn't have motion in that church [Wesley United Methodist Church, York, South Carolina].  So I longed for my [maternal] grandmother's [Amelia Fagen Lucas] church where it was completely opposite with this energy, and my grandmother's church is back in the woods.  And they use to baptized people in the creek, you know, until they actually got a baptismal in church.  I mean it was that rural and, you know, and our church was one of the, you know, one of the, the couple of the churches that were pulled up.  We were the, the highly educated and, and because we were that we didn't, you know, we didn't respond that same way.  So I, I would do it anyway I would think that, that's yes I was very I was vocal.  I mean, a lot of people as a kid thought that I would be a minister, you know.  A lot of people kept saying, you know, you've been called.  And I would say, you know, I haven't heard it (laughter) I--no one's calling me but because I was so active and I was the one that always lead the Easter speeches.  I remember you talking about sounds and callings I remember kids on Easter and those outfits and saying we say have an afternoon program where we would do, you know.  And everyone had to do an Easter speech, and, you know, you'd rehearse this, and it was so important to get that right in church.  And, and school [Jefferson Elementary School, York, South Carolina] had that same kind of thing of, of reciting but we used to love to do that it was that of, of whether it's biblical or whether it's something about black history.  But those, those--that, that ended when, when schools merged that kind of performance.  Now that I think about it and I don't know what that means why it ended.  But that ended, that was a real part of--because theater I mean, theater began in the church.  So it's no accident that what, what we would do this sort of call and response that would happen in church what would happen in school what happened in the theater.  It's that, that performance-based energy and I remember that especially in the school as well but as, as a kid I was just always, always organizing.  Always doing what my mom had said trying to have my reach exceed my grasp, you know.
Story_ID: 373020
Speaker 1: So now you go on to high school, or did you go to middle school, did you go straight from elementary school [Jefferson Elementary School, York, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Elementary school was up to sixth grade, so there was junior high--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in, in our day which was seventh and eighth grade that was still segregated.  But by then we had Freedom of Choice and Freedom of Choice was when you could decide to go to the all-black school or you could go to the white school.  Now the whites didn't have a choice that they could just be in a white school, but, you know, we had a, you know, we were very fortu-, we could decide.  Now that (laughter) I think about it--we could go to the all-white school, be called nigger every day.  Or we (laughter) could be, or we could stay in the black school.  And I stayed in that school I stayed in Jefferson Junior High [Jefferson Junior High School, York, South Carolina], seventh and eighth grade.  I had relatives and friends who went to York Junior High [York Junior High School, York, South Carolina], you know, but I didn't go.  So seventh and eighth grade still a part of, of that, that segregated school.  I was in the--the band was very important to me then.  We--I was all-state band when I was in junior high in the high school division.  That was--I remember going to Charleston [South Carolina] for the all-state conference and us playing.  And, and, you know, because I was so young, you know, and I was like the youngest one out of all the, all the students and, and being down there for that.  And getting that taste getting that glimpse of art of what the world would be.  You know, what music does what all of these things do and that was--so my, my first forms of that came through my music came through playing especially playing the trumpet.  And so seventh and eighth grade I was still in the segregated school.
Story_ID: 373021
Speaker 1: Ninth grade, the schools merged, and it was mandatory desegregation by then. They were desegregated--it was separate but equal, then it was Freedom of Choice, and then, then the mandatory desegregation happened my ninth grade year.  So my class was the first class to go through a full four years of, of school being desegregated (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Desegregated.
Speaker 1: And the thing that I--which went off without a hitch in my town because they--all these other schools across the South were rioting.  Remember they would what would happen the schools would merge, and they would ignore the black schools' colors, song, all their history and just maintain the school.  And what happened with us was York--there were other schools as well.  These other smaller towns, Sharon [South Carolina], Hickory Grove [South Carolina], that were also merging, and they said listen we have all these things we're going to keep it York High [York High School, York, South Carolina] until the new school is built.  And when the new school is built then we'll change the colors and traditions and the whole thing.  And York High School were green dragons, dragon as in the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK].  So (laughter) I--my whole four years in, in high school I spent as a green dragon because we were blue devils at Jefferson [Jefferson High School, York, South Carolina] and we became York green dragons.  And we--all the other schools were rioting and, and upset and protesting, you know, the change because they would just ignore black schools' traditions.  They would ignore that they had that background which is something that happens universally in this country, you know, that background, history is always ignored.  And I remember us going okay we will wait to the new school and when the school happens then everything, everything must change that's what is supposed to be.  So we didn't--because they was saving all the money they did this whole plea about what that was and they were changing everything but they couldn't.  So let's keep the uniforms and let's keep all of this because we can't afford it and we're gonna change it anyway we'll do that then.  So I went through all four years and it didn't change. The year after I graduated is when the new school was finally built.  And they were supposed to change everything, and they said, you know, what we spent all the money we, we can't do it.  We just gonna keep it and it's going to be the green dragons, right.
Story_ID: 373022
Speaker 1: So Hickory Grove High School [Hickory Grove, South Carolina], which w-, which were the red cardinals, was an all-white school, maybe a few black students there, but basically an all-white school.  York High [York High School, York South Carolina] was all-white, and people at York, even though this is a mill town, they looked down on Hickory Grove that was even, you know, even more mill than they were.  You know, more redneck more hick than they were.  And then so you had Hickory Grove, York High and Jefferson [Jefferson High School, York, South Carolina], these three different groups coming together green dragons, blue devils, red cardinals.  And so we all said okay, everything's fine, we'll wait. The school was built the school board said we can't afford it we gonna keep it as green dragons which was what they intended to do all along.  And the blue devils, you know, the black kids went crazy, they said, no, we will not do this, we will not do this but what happened was the kids from Hickory Grove High which were red cardinals, they also were upset because their traditions were being denied.  So the kids--the black kids from Jefferson and the white kids from Hickory Grove banded together against the other white kids from York High.  So for the first time, like all the other, all the other schools fighting all over the country, it was very distinct black and white, you know.  In, in York's [York, South Carolina] case, it was a real question of color, and there was there was an article in like Newsweek about it called 'A Question of Color' [ph.] because it really it, it crossed these lines, and it was such a fascinating story that it wasn't just black and white these black kids, and white kids had banded together to fight against the other white kids.  I mean black kids were going to white chur-, they were having meetings in churches.  They were having meetings in places where, you know, black kids had never been in white churches white kids had never been to these black churches, it was quite an incredible, incredible time.  And I was in college [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina], furious, you know, that I was missing out on it.  So whenever I could come home and agitate (laughter), I would because I thought I have to be a part of this I have to be a part.  And all my friends--my friend Steve Love who's now the head of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] there.  You know, they were that class that was their senior year, and it was such a, a fight, but it won the won--they ended up changing and now there the cardinals, you know.  And it's a hold--but that thing of, you know, traditions are important traditions--your history is important, and I love that the people in my hometown said no.  We will not stand for this, you know, you, you went back on what you promised us.  We allowed you these few years because we understood that we know we don't have this money.  We're building a state-of-the-art school we understand all the things we're doing but then they went back one that.  And I loved--it's such a great story that they bonded, you know, and it wasn't just by, by color line.
Story_ID: 373023
Speaker 1: So this was your--ninth through twelfth grade you went to York High School [York, South Carolina] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) York High School, yes.
Speaker 1: And it was predominantly white?
Speaker 2: It was--no, it was two-thirds white--
Speaker 1: Okay, two-thirds.
Speaker 2: --it was probably a third black and maybe a third--yeah, probably a third black.
Speaker 1: Had you had all black teachers up until this time?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All black teachers up until ninth grade.
Speaker 1: So how was your first experience with a white teacher?
Speaker 2: You know, my whole career, my whole life (laughter) I, I have a dear friend named Sheldon Epps, who's direct and, and he run Pasadena Playhouse [Pasadena, California].  And he directed 'Blue' [Charles Randolph-Wright] when we did it at the Roundabout [Roundabout Theatre Company], and I remember us doing this interview where I remember us doing this, this interview or and we do for all of these different people and like board members and donors and this whole group came to hear us speak.  These two, you know, black men talking about this project.  And, and my whole joke is that people are always--oh, you're so articulate.  That's the word, you know, that's the word that I constantly get, and I keep saying to Sheldon, "We're so articulate," you know.  "What do--what do they want us to be what they expect us to be?"  So I think the thing that happened especially with my white teachers in, in ninth grade were they would just say old, you know.  I mean, I was the I was a smart kid.  I was the top kid in my class and that's was what that was, you know.  So I don't think--I don't really remember any rampant racism from any of my teachers which I guess is pretty amazing.  College [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina] is another story we'll get to that, but high school, no.  I think they were, you know, the problem though with me and high school and that I talk about this it was the height of affirmative action.  And people were so--because kids were rioting all over the South especially and I don't know what you went through--oh, you were up here, though, so it's a different thing.  But they were all these, you know, constantly because of kids being mistreated and the academics difference and all these different things.  I mean it was, it was always this issue so what they did at York in my school was they tried to make--tried to appease everything by doing co-, like we had co-presidents of the class.  Or you had a, a system where there were three you had a president, vice president and a secretary of the class and one of them had to be black.  So it was the, the idea it was this affirmative action in place where to be sure that people have representatives--a great idea in theory so that people were represented.  It was quite important to be represented because the majority kids could've ruled them out.  Also, you had these schools merging, and no one knew each other, so how do you vote on these people and so I understood that.  But the thing that happened all through my four years is that you get to the place where you feel that you're always the black person.  Who is the, you know, I'm the black co-president.  I'm the black scholarship recipient, I'm the black this--everything, you know.  And I wanted to just be the person who got it.  I wanted to be the talented person, not just the black talented person it was always that identity, that category.  And that's I think they're things that are fantastic about affirmative actions and are still imperative.  But I think that's the problem with it is that you end up being categorized.  And you end up being labeled that you are there because of it, whereas you are just as talented as the other person.  You didn't have an opportunity, and this gives you an opportunity, but once you get in that place, you have to maintain.  You have to, you have to still do what it is you do.  You know, you can't--it doesn't, it doesn't keep you there it may open a door, but it doesn't keep you there.
Story_ID: 373024
Speaker 1: So we were talking about high school.
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You went to York High School [York, South Carolina], and you graduated what year?
Speaker 2: I graduated in 1974.
Speaker 1: Seventy-four [1974], okay we're gonna put a pin right there in '74 [1974], but I wanna go--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --back to 1960 in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: When the Civil Rights Movement was going on--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I understand that your family was in--
Speaker 2: Very active.
Speaker 1: Very active.
Speaker 2: Very active.
Speaker 1: So tell me about that?
Speaker 2: Well, I had relatives at--especially my, my cousin, Rick [ph.].  I remember Rick had an afro that was like this (gesture), you know, late '60s [1960s].  And I remember all of us going to these meetings, NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] meetings.  You know, but all these other different like SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee], different groups that, that my cousins were a part of, and I emulated them.  I was younger and wanted to be a part of this 'cause they were in college.  And very, very active in this and going, going to Atlanta [Georgia].  Their relatives, my cousins' relatives in Atlanta lived on Hunter Street [Martin Luther King Jr. Drive] where all--where everyone was.  And so they knew Andr-, you know, the Youngs and the Kings and so they were a part of this and marched.  I had family members who marched with King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] in Selma [Alabama].  And they, they would they would get in cars and--which you had to 'cause you couldn't get there another way and drive to these different to different meetings, you know.  They were in Tennessee I mean I, I remember them going to these meetings and saying to me, explaining to me what the meeting was this is what this is 'cause, you know, I was young.  And saying this is what this is and, you know, what this means and this is what we're doing and why we're doing it.  And, and what Rosa Parks was and just, you know, and what Emmett Till, you know, then that picture in Eb-, in Jet, you know, having them showing that picture to me as a kid, you know.  In my play 'Cuttin' Up' [Charles Randolph-Wright] I have a thing when it says you know that picture gave me nightmares.  And, and my relative saying, "Good," you know, "it should give you nightmares."

Speaker 1: So being, realizing that we could not sit back.  That we had to take action, even in our hometown [York, South Carolina] that we that they were, ugh, they were boycotting businesses.  The idea of trying to get the, the bathrooms, you know.  Get getting rid of, of the apartheid (laughter) in, in bathrooms the segregated bathrooms of getting us to be able to swim in the pool in my hometown 'cause I couldn't swim in that pool until I was fifteen, you know.  The--getting equality of the roads paved getting these dirt roads paved in my hometown like that road that I was telling you about that was paved a while back because of the schools.  But there were a lot of roads that weren't paved and especially NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  I remember the NAACP being so active and they still are and my mom [Ruth Lillian Lucas Wright Johnson], you know, a few years ago saying you have to, you know.  Why don't you become a lifetime member?  You must be a lifetime member which I immediately did (laughter) 'cause you can't tell my mother no.  But--and my mom just got--this pa-, I went home and surprised her because she got just got the President's Award from the NAACP in South Carolina and I went back for that and surprised her.  But she's always been this, this--and not quiet, she's always been this activist.  My mom didn't like traveling so she would begrudgingly go to some of the cities but my cousins I would pop in a car with them and go to a rally, go to a conference.  I remember holding placards and, and making, making these posters and, and working with them too, you know, to change things.  The, the Friendship [South Carolina]--the whole thing that happened at Friendship and in Rock Hill [South Carolina] at the--where they boycotted the Woolworths [F.W. Woolworth Company].  That was ten miles from my hometown, you know, the--my cousins were at Orangeburg [South Carolina] when the whole thing happened at South Carolina State [South Carolina State College; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina], some students were shot.  I mean, all of these different, different stories, different places, you know.  Somebody from my family was in it, you know, they were like in the thick of it and, and reporting back.  You know, this is what this was--we have to go and, and, I--you know, doing fundraisers.  Selling donuts, washing cars all these things to, to get money for people to go to conventions.  To send money to campaigns, to send money to different--all of that I just--that was just a part of--that was a part of--that's what you did.  It was just, you know, now I mean and when you're asking about it I, I'm trying to think of all the things because it was just a matter of fact.  It was just like going to church we were talking about that before I was never forced to go to church.  It was something I always wanted--I still go to church.  I mean people are stunned especially in my business that I go to church every Sunday no matter where I am.  No matter what city I'm in, it's my ground it's my foundation how I function, and I say especially, especially when you're successful you need to go to church.  I said, people--'cause you think it comes from you, and it doesn't, and I said everyone runs to church when things are bad.  I said, but you really need to run to church when things are good that's the time that you must have grace when you must say thank you.  When you must have that gratitude.  So I--and thinking about it I'm thinking about all these times with them where we went and did things in different communities and for different families.  And, and also helping families that were underprivileged and clothing drives and food drives and, and Thanksgiving tur-, I mean that was all the stuff that we were always doing.  That I actually had not thought about 'til just now because it was a matter of fact.  It wasn't something like every Christmas we did something no we were doing that every week.  It was a part of the voter drives, oh my god the voter drives I remember so specifically my grandmother, my mother's mother Amelia [Amelia Fagen Lucas], who was so active.  She would always go vote, you know, every year she would go vote. In her nineties it would be, "I'm going to go vote."  And she would go vote, and I would say, "Grandma, you can do absentee ballot.  You don't have to," you know, it's freezing, or it's, it's this or it's raining, the weather's bad.  "Why are you going?"  And she says, "I remember when I couldn't go," she says, "If, if there's a cha-, I will go and I will go there in person and do this."  And so it's that kind of fabric that I had that's the--that's my, that's my palate (laughter).  You know that I paint with that is like no, no I couldn't do this so now I have to go.  So all of those things campaigning for people having relatives who were running.  You know, having, having all of that was a part of my family.
Story_ID: 373026
Speaker 1: Oh, high school [York High School, York, South Carolina], before, before we leave that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, before we leave high school.  Okay.
Speaker 1: They--you were asking me about the teachers before?
Speaker 2: Uh-hm.
Speaker 1: I mean they were, I mean they were all really supportive.  I mean now I'm thinking about it I just--I don't I don't remember that--not having that kind of support from them And all of them pushing me.  My--you know, my mom [Ruth Lillian Lucas Wright Johnson] was a teacher at the same school, so I know that was part of it.  They knew that, that--and she was very outspoken and very well loved, you know, all the students.  I mean she, she affected so many people, and I see that constantly especially now all the people that she taught and, and them remembering.  My mother used to make the kids learn Chaucer [Geoffrey Chaucer] in the Old English.  I was in London [England] last week, and they were doing 'Canterbury Tales' ['The Canterbury Tales,' Geoffrey Chaucer], and I said, I'm sorry, I have to go see this.  And it started, and this thing just went--my mother made them say, you know, learn this whole first section in old English and stand up and do it in class.  I mean what that did I mean first of all in the black school but then black and white kids, you know, and all these people still talk about the effect my mom had because she didn't limit them she didn't limit the black kids to being black kids.  She didn't limit these southern kids because people think southerners is a certain thing and that we're hicks, and we're less educated and all these things.  And she would not allow that there's--why shouldn't you learn the old English?  Why shouldn't you speak French, why shouldn't you do all these things?  That was that was my mom so, in high school, I had these elements of all of these teachers who was strong influences of who all pushed me.
Story_ID: 373027
Speaker 1: I thi- probably the greatest influence was my band director who really taught me what art was because we had a championship high school band, we toured, you know.  We would go and play in these competitions and, and were award-winning.  And then we used to do these concerts every year, and I had only seen band concerts as just being, you know, a concert but he--they were like Broadway spectacles, it was Band Revue, it was called. And here in the middle of nowhere South Carolina they would put on these things, and it was singing and dancing and sets, and--I, I remember seeing the first one just with my mouth open first of all because I, I loved it and enjoyed it.  But secondly because I understood it.  It was exactly what I knew, it was exactly what I did, and I think more than--especially his name was John[AB1] Bostic.  He was so influential in my artistic career again making me realize that I had no limits.  Even though I was in York, South Carolina, it didn't mean I couldn't be the best musician or the best artist.  My French teacher in high school [York High School, York, South Carolina] for example also was this artist she was an actress. And if she had left York [South Carolina] she would've been, she could've been a name actress I mean she was that kind of talent.  And now still is 'cause she's not that much older than me she was younger she started teaching.  She's still an actress, and it's like the top actress in, in the community in Charlotte [North Carolina], York, that whole community she does all these things.  And I've just started I'm starting an art festival at Winthrop University [Rock Hill, South Carolina] called Create Carolina.  And she's one of the people I'm doing it with, and it's, it's been one of the first places I'm directing, she's gonna be in.  And, and it's really incredible to have that turnaround.  You know, this was my teacher, and I always introduced her as, you know, she was my teacher.  But again she made us all, you know, in French class, we always had to speak French we couldn't speak English.  And she would have--we would have French dinners, and French films.  I mean, she would do things that you wouldn't have in South Carolina, you know.  She--so I had all these teachers like that.  My guidance counselors said, you know, you can go anywhere you want.  You can be anything they, they none of them ever limited me, and I just, I'm so grateful for that now that I think about it that I didn't, you know, it was that thing.  And yes there was some who, you know, had that energy that because I was black this black kid and what that meant.  And where I came from but, you know, all of us in that school proved ourselves.  So they could not, you know, we, we had a lot of people in that school who were very talented in different ways, and they couldn't deny that.
Story_ID: 373028
Speaker 1: And we forced them, you know, to acknowledge us and my, my favorite story, and I just told this recently back in Carolina.  Is there's an award--every year there all these awards that you get, you know, the senior class your get different things. And there were (laughter), and I was the student body president.  And I was in every activity on earth just so, you know, I can get out of class travel and do whatever.  I was--before that my junior year in high school [York High School, York, South Carolina], I was very active in student government and was involved in the state student government because I was the representative that they sent and got to travel all over the state.  That's why I knew a lot of the cities in, in South Carolina 'cause I traveled there, and my junior year I ran for one of the state offices 'cause I thought, you know, I really want to be involved.  I'd gone to summer camp with these kids; we were all a part of, you know, every summer we were involved since my freshman year.  So my junior year I ran for the, the vice president because if you were president, your school had to host the conference. We weren't large enough and didn't have enough money obviously 'cause we wouldn't change our color (laughter) so we couldn't, but I ran for vice president.  And I think there were ten of us running, and it was the first time that I ran for something where I wasn't the black candidate.  And so there were three different (unclear)--president, vice president and a secretary that were elected and there was another person who was appointed.  So in each category, I remember this was 1973 and each--in South Carolina in each category, there were black and white kids running for each thing.  And there wasn't a quota because we always had that quota system one out of three, you know, there wasn't a quota.  And I was so thrilled that I actually had a opportunity to run for something where it was just me.  And there were ten of us running for vice president than there was a runoff between me and someone else.  And I remember being in this State House [South Carolina State House, Columbia, South Carolina] in South Carolina--that state capitol that still has that Confederate flag hanging outside of it.  I remember being in the state capitol and them announcing the winners and the secretary was my friend Crystal [ph.], who was black, and she won secretary.  And, you know, immediately all of us felt well forget us right that's not gonna happen (laughter).  And then they announced vice president, and I won, and I was vice president, and then they announced the president and he also was black.  And that year in 197-, '73 [1973] '74 [1974], my senior year the three elected offices of the state's student body were black.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: I mean it was a huge thing that you know, but you wouldn't see that in the press, you know.  You'll only see how we were fighting each other, and I think the, you know, the majority of students who voted were white.  So they obviously--even if they had a, even if they had--if we had just done a little black block to, to win it's for in my case especially because he came a runoff between two people.  You know, they had to, you know, we won by all of the kids, you know.  All the kids had to vote, and that was one of the most meaningful things that ever happened to me.  That really changed me because it's that point where I thought, you know, I can be that person.  I was elected that vice president because I was the one that they wanted to be and not the black one I was the one and that was very important to me.  And to watch in this southern state, you know, at this timeframe thirty years ago to watch what happened, you know, you would never believe that that happened back then.  You know, you wouldn't see it now (laughter) so the fact--but they really judged us on merits.  And that was so I, I will never forget that, that was a really, really important time for me and placed me in that, in that pattern and that journey on my life's journey knowing I have to always go for this.  I have to always go for that ultimate thing and not settle.  My family had taught me that then the student body the student governments of South Carolina showed me, you know, you can do this.  I mean that's important that and yes you can succeed it may seem impossible but you can.
Story_ID: 373029
Speaker 1: So senior year there were--it was awards day, and it was all the seniors getting awards.  And in this class all the class superlatives, and, you know, and the, the student body president and, and the student, you know all the different things.  There was an award called the DAR which is the--and the SAR awards which is the Sons of the American Revolution and Daughters of the American Revolution, you cannot get whiter than those awards. It is the person--it would go to the woman and the man who had the highest academic average in the in the school [York High School, York, South Carolina].  Now this was my senior year. Prior to that, you know, they were all both of those they were white both years.  I mean the three years, ninth my ninth grade, tenth grade, eleventh grade year, but twelfth grade, my senior year, I had the highest male academic average.  So I got this award. In the assembly the man who had who was the head of the DAR--you're laughing already--the man who was the head of the SAR was also known to be the head of the Klan [Ku Klux Klan, KKK], okay.  So in this assembly, and my French teacher and I were just talking about this, she says, "I will never forget this day as long as I live."  We had the assembly I'm sitting there knowing I'm sitting in the audience knowing I'm about to get this award.  You know, he has to give it to me which is the last thing on earth he wants to do okay, so they announce it the announced me you know the class cheers.  I go up on the stage in the auditorium I can see this so clearly I see him he hands me the award, and I hug him on stage cameras flashing like crazy the local papers the whole thing that I hugged him on stage which of course was the main picture.  And the class screaming 'cause they all knew I was going to do something, but that was even more than they expected.  And--but this is what--how life changes.  How the world changes and I keep, and I talk a lot about how, you know, in the South especially is a place that's changed the most because we always knew where the boundaries were.  I knew where the railroad tracks were.  I knew where I was not wanted.  I knew that this person didn't like me or didn't respect me or had a problem with me because they told me to my face.  And when I worked in Boston [Massachusetts], when I worked in California where I worked in these places especially California that was supposed to be so liberal.  The most racism I've ever encountered was in California, not in South Carolina where I had grew up because we knew what that was and if you decided to cross those lines that's what you did.  You may get that cross burnt on your front lawn you may have those things happen to you, but you decided to do that.  And I witnessed all of that, so that was in '74 [1974] say it may have been ten years later, you know, I was the grand marshal of the Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] parade in my hometown.  Now, first of all, them having Martin Luther King parade in my (laughter) hometown was huge I thought wow.  And then they asked me to come back and be the grand marshal by then I had done different work, and I was living in California.  So I came back, and I didn't want to do it I basically did it for my mother [Ruth Lillian Lucas Wright Johnson].  All my family came I thought this a--be for them I don't want to do this I don't care about this right.  So I got there, and I started in this car, and we started down the street, and we passed the swimming pool where I couldn't swim.  And I thought I'm grand marshal of this parade heading down this, this street heading down this, this t-, we passed the courthouse where there were the separate bathrooms.  All these things I started passing and the people on the streets they were all my friends.  I thought I was going to be very, you know; they thought I was gonna be very arrogant and, and you know, uppity.  And I was talking to them like we were, you know, screaming at people it was so much fun.  We passed the courthouse, the main courthouse, and I looked up and on the steps was this guy who used to be the head of the Klan, who was the head of SAR doing this (gesture) to me.  And I thought, first of all, he made the effort to come to this because this is not something--this was the Martin Luther King parade this wasn't the York [South Carolina] Christmas parade, you know, and it floored me.  I will never forget that, that moment because he was, you know, he was proud of what I've become of what I was doing.  And, you know, we all changed, he changed.  We all--but because we were honest because we dealt with it, we talked we were able to, to change things.  And I really see that change happening in the South more so than anywhere because of the honesty because of you couldn't help but know what certain things were.  And that's--but that, that especially from high school was my, my now my greatest memory of, of just truly what the world can be.  And if you, you know, and how what my family taught me of how you have to go for it.  You know, I could've just taken my award and been (unclear), but I couldn't (laughter).
Story_ID: 373030
Speaker 1: So in high school [York High School, York, South Carolina] is this where you decide that--when did you decide what you wanted to, to be or become as far as a profession?
Speaker 2: In high school I was gonna be a doctor.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I mean that was that's what you do, you know, in my family we are all professionals.  So I had to be doctor, lawyer, teacher something, so I wanted to be a doctor.  And I, I wanted to go to Duke [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina] because Duke again I think my whole life (laughter) has been about breaking down these doors and going to these places where they don't want you.  And Duke was one of the last schools to desegregate it was one of the places that I thought oh I'm not supposed to be here.  Very few people I think only one other person from my hometown, no one of color, but only one other person that actually even gone to Duke.  I mean it was that--Duke was more it, it was further away to people in my community than Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California] 'cause that was very--I really liked Stanford, and I wanted to go there.  It was something about Stanford I wanted, but it was too far away it was, you know, West Coast, I just thought no.  And this the--this was 1974 when it was the height of affirmative action, and every university in the country wanted that black kid who--and I was the, you know, student body president from the South.  I had the grades, and I had the SAT scores and speaking of which I have to tell you an SAT story.
Story_ID: 373031
Speaker 1: I took the SAT my sophomore year [at York High School, York, South Carolina] I guess first or whenever it was when I first took it.  And did very well on math and not as well on verbal, and I thought, this is ridiculous my mother [Ruth Lillian Lucas Wright Johnson] is an English teacher.  I mean, I have a vocabulary--I don't understand this isn't--why I didn't do well on this test?  I don't get this and I literally (laughter) went to my guidance counselor imagine this in South Carolina in the '70s [1970s], and I said, "I took this test wrong."  I said, "I took this test as me, and I have to go take it as a white boy, I didn't do that." And so, you know, they were in shock.  Because I mean my score already was high, but I was like no it should be--my verbal is far too low this is wrong.  I'm ready to go take this test again.  And they were like they were all freaked out.  And especially this whole thing of saying--because those tests were so--they would say okay read this paragraph what do you think the title of this should be.  And I took it, and I did what that was--I told 'em what I thought it should be, that's not what they wanted to know.  You know, there were certain things in it and especially there that I thought wait a minute I have to re-think this.  I have to do it from their standpoint and not take it as me because I have a very different viewpoint.  Also, as an artist, all those things that I am are coming across in this test.  So I did, I took this, and my score went up 250 points.
Speaker 2: My.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, because of how I took that test. Well now we know that we all know we have to learn how to take tests, but we didn't know--then you tried to take them honestly.  You didn't study to take the test, you know, now that's what you do, and they don't prove anything accept that you took the test well, you know.  So that's (laughter) what and it--but I ended up doing that and, and having my score go up I forget the exact amount, but it was that much I mean it was that drastic.
Story_ID: 373032
Speaker 1: Then so I had all those things I was I--the mailman who ended up becoming the mayor of my hometown [York, South Carolina].  Years later but he would, he would call me and go, "I'm not bringing all these things, come, come pick up your mail," 'cause I would get broch-, I would get a hundred brochures a week from I mean every school in the country because I was National Merit [National Merit Scholarship] so every, every--, you know, you get all these lists.  So here is this National Merit, black kid from the South I had every curricular activity you could imagine on earth.  It was like I was the ideal, you know, on paper I was that primo candidate.  So I had every school offered me a scholarship so when Duke [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina] happened there's a scholarship at Duke called the A.B. Duke Scholarship [Angier B. Duke Memorial Scholarship], which is the academic scholarship.  And I--when I found out about it, and as, you know, and I applied for I thought this would be the ultimate because this is something we don't get this is something you don't see us happening.  Yes, academics, you know, athletic scholarship but this at academic scholarship and I ended up getting it, and that's why went to Duke.  So I ended up--so my--Duke was where I decided to go into undergraduate, but I had literally every school in the country.  I could've gone anywhere because of that timeframe and what they were looking for and what I saw happening to was that all these, all these students like we were snatched out of these schools.  And, and placed, you know, because of affirmative action and thrown into colleges and once they got there, they were dropped, they weren't helped.  You all of a sudden 'cause, you know, when I got to Duke, they covered I remember my first chemistry lab, he covered everything I knew in the first two minutes.  And I just thought I'm in trouble, you know, I was not ready for what that was.  And I think about these kids again because of my family I had a support system to help me because it was really difficult for me that first year.  And I had to keep my average up for the scholarship and, you know, all of these things.  I mean and I think about these kids who didn't have that and how they were thrown in these environments.  My class was the largest class of, of black students in Duke this was the '74 [1974] that year.  You know, it was the largest class they had up 'til that time.  And half of my class I'm trying to think half of my class literally dropped out after the first semester or after the second semester because it was so hard and we had no place.  It was very difficult it was very difficult to be in a university where the only faces that looks like you were the people were serving you.  You know, in the cafeteria the people who were cleaning up after you in the buildings.  And to go in the classroom and never see people who looked like you.  Because I saw people that looked like me in high school [York High School, York, South Carolina], you know, I saw (unclear) at home.  You know, but, but in, in--it was it was a very difficult and how students chose to deal with that--
Speaker 2: (AUDIO DISTURBANCE)
Speaker 1: --how they chose to let it hurt them.  You know and I, and I would watch kids not talking to the people working in the cafeterias because they were protecting themselves.
Story_ID: 373033
Speaker 1: So we were talking about you going to Duke [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in 1974, and tell me about your major while in college (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I, I was pre-med at Duke, which I think probably 60 percent of my class was, and 39 percent were pre-law, and then 1 percent were whatever (laughter).  That's where you--that's why you went that's what--and as I said my, my freshman year, my chemistry class, I just remember being completely overwhelmed with going--this is he's covered everything I know in two minutes how will I get through this.  And it was, it was a difficult year, for the first time in my life I had to study.  I'd never studied before I could just do it.  It was, you know, because here were all these, you know, the nation's best and the nation's finest.  And they were--it was, it was very difficult it was difficult asking for help.  I didn't know how to do that I never had to do that I was the one that helped everybody else.  You know, that I had to get tutored for this calculus class was astonishing to me because we hadn't had this in my high school [York High School, York, South Carolina].  You know, they started I'd missed two years of work that most 'cause all these kids had, had, you know, the--most of them had been--a lot of them had been prep schools.  And all these other things and had an academic background I didn't have.  So but I, you know, I persevered and actually did well and ended up doing my--I was pre-med and started singing.  There was a gospel choir on campus that I started singing with, and then a friend of mine convinced me to do--be in a show.  They were doing this one then they needed this guy to be in a show, and I did it and was completely hooked.  I thought I want to do this I've always wanted to do this I felt this when I was in high school.  I felt this, this art in me, but I didn't think I could do it.  I grew up in York, South Carolina I can't be--I needed to have grown up in New York [New York].  I needed to go to school in California.  I'm not, you know, I can't be an artist, you know, not from where I'm from so I still I did that.  And enjoyed it, but I still ignored this then I had a teacher my second semester freshman year.  My first, my first my English teacher first semester freshman year was classic.  It was this thing where this woman would not give me an A.  And, and I was furious, I was furious because I saw like the other kids in class and what they got.  And I just knew, and she was--just things she would say, you know, and talking about Faulkner [William Faulkner] and everyone else--just so racist and I was infuriated.  So there was a girl in the class who became a very dear friend of mine, and I convinced her to do this switch with me.  So I wrote her paper, and she wrote mine, and we turned it in 'cause she'd gotten all A's on all her papers and (laughter) and so I--we switched papers.  And again it was the same thing she got an A for the paper that I wrote.  And then she gave me a B on hers.  And I, you know, I went to the dean I went to this whole thing 'cause I said this woman's racist.  Oh well, it's in me, you know.
Story_ID: 373034
Speaker 1: I was, you know, I got to school, and I was so upset because there were no protests.  I was ready to come protest, and they were trying to build--the Forestry School [School of Forestry and Environmental Studies; Nicholas School of the Environment, Durham, North Carolina] was trying to do something on campus.  So, you know, I was the first one to go for that I had to find something to protest.  But believe me at Duke [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina] I had a lot I could do because it was, you know, the black students were really marginalized.  And, and even though it was the height of affirmative action it was also at the same time that backlash of affirmative action.  That whole energy of you don't belong here and I really, really felt that there.  And my, my defense and my response was to really embrace who I was and embrace all the people on campus that I saw.  So all the people--all the women who worked in the cafeteria and all the janitors, and all of them I befriended.  And would go to their churches on Sundays and would hang out with their families.  And when I saw the other--and a lot of black kids who still do this to this day when I go to school I see it, and I understand it because it's how they survive it.  Is that if I ignored them, then I won't be that if I ignored them, that's my family.  My mother [Ruth Lillian Lucas Wright Johnson] worked as a maid to put me in the school that's what, you know, this is how I got here.  So I don't wanna watch this woman, you know, and for me I did the exact opposite.  I embraced them, and it really is what got me through that first year because they were pulling for me.  They were saying, you know, 'cause I wanted to give up I didn't like it.  I just I felt out of place.  I didn't, I didn't have--I didn't know what my voice was.  I had to work too hard.  And it was a real struggle, which happened to all of us there.  And as I said, half of my class ended up leaving because it was, it was devastating.  And it was, and it was racist, and it was really a, a difficult environment, and you had no support--there were no black professors.

Speaker 1: So my sophomore year [at Duke University, Durham, North Carolina], so second semester freshman year there's a teacher named Diane Maury [ph.], who was a graduate s-, you know, graduate teacher doing, and she taught a class the absurdist view in literature.  Well, it was right up my alley 'cause I loved anything outrageous, so we studied Sartre [Jean-Paul Sartre] and Camus [Albert Camus], Kurt Vonnegut, all these and these, these books, these novels that were so esoteric and so--not everything to me was black and white then.  Everything was about having it was so, you know, as I said so racist and having to struggle.  It was so incredible to enter this world of literature that dealt with life from these metaphysical levels for all these things so far beyond color.  So beyond race so in an opposite realm that it was it saved me.  And this teacher saw the, the artist in me and made me write and perform an absurdist musical as my final.  And she said, "No, no you're not writing a paper," because I was always doing something I always--she just saw it in me.  And I said, but I can't be a performer I'm not I can do this I'm gonna be a doctor.  Then she literally pushed me I mean we're, we're friends to this day.  I mean she's now a dean at Queens College [Queens University of Charlotte] in Charlotte [North Carolina], which is near my hometown [York, South Carolina], so I go see her whenever I'm at home.  But and she wasn't that much older than me, so we were friends, but she saw this in me and told me, you know, this is what you should be doing.  And that was probably--that was obviously my greatest influence in college because of her I've been--said okay.  Okay, I can pursue this while I'm doing my other thing 'cause I didn't know what I was majoring in any way.  I was originally a psychology major but what I disliked about psychology was that it was so rigid that things fit into categories.  And I said, that's not true, I mean that they don't fit in these categories.  We, we don't fit in these categories so religion--I became a religion major because it offered, it offered this open world.  It offered this environment and I got to study world religions and which was fascinating to me.  And so I became a religion major.
Story_ID: 373036
Speaker 1: My sophomore year at Duke [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina] I then started be--getting involved in the theater program there.  And I'd worked in summers in the amusement park, Carowinds [Charlotte, North Carolina] amusement park in--outside of Charlotte [North Carolina] between Charlotte and the Carolina--and Rock Hill [South Carolina].  And I, I started I realized I want to pursue this.  But I was really I, I, you know, didn't think I first of all that I could do it.  That I, I didn't have that background I had the musician background.  And I played trumpet in the Duke band--I did that for a minute, but I didn't--I had this championship band that I was in, in high school [York High School, York, South Carolina].  And then the Duke band was like they, they were just playing at the games and they could care it was they didn't even have uniforms it was just that no, no.  And then I knew wasn't going--I, I thought am I gonna be a musician and he didn't feel right.  And I was still trying to be this doctor from, from because that's what I was supposed because of my family.  And my sophomore year I saw--my roommate's, my roommate's girlfriend--they were going to see a show and his girlfriend got sick, and he called me.  And I was in my organic chemistry lab, and he said, "Listen I have this ticket and will you come and see this show with me because she's sick," his girlfriend's sick.  And I wanted to get out of it anyway I said, "Fine. I can't deal with this lab tonight," so I went.  And it was the touring company of the show 'Pippin,' and I saw the show, and it literally changed my life.  And I saw this character that Ben Vereen had played on Broadway that was--it was an existential musical because it was about there is no meaning to life.  And this kid and it was about this kid Pippin who's trying to figure out what to do with his life and his father was the king, but nothing's working.  And this ragtag team of players comes through town and, and led by Ben Vereen.  Who is this black man who completely orchestrated everything, who was the smartest, and who was the one who told them what to do and I loved seeing this black man in control.  He wasn't the person being controlled, he was the one pulling the strings.  I went this is extraordinary and I--that night I sat on the steps of the East Campus Library [Lilly Library] with my friend Mary Lynn Yakel [ph.] who's now a bank president.  And I said, "My life has changed," I said, "I have to do this, I have to go after this." And I started thinking about different people that I knew who were really unhappy.  I started thinking about people in my family, people from my school.  I had two teachers in my high school who obviously didn't want to be there teaching. Who were okay teachers, who were good teachers, but they wanted to do something else and they didn't do it.  And I just, I realized that especially that I was far more afraid of not trying something then failure.  That it--and again it was my mom [Ruth Lillian Lucas Wright Johnson], that was my family, but I thought I must try this.  I must go after my dream, I don't want to spend years, years later I have some practices in some town, and I'm thinking I should've done this.  What if I'd gone after this?  So I literally went into the arts because I didn't want to say what if, and I thought, I can always go back to school I can always go do what I need to do, but here I have an opportunity, and I'm gonna go for it.  And I threw myself in it with several friends we started a black theater group at Duke.  We had a black dance group, we did a gospel choir.  All of a sudden it was this art explosion in my sophomore year.  It was all the stuff I joined the Duke choir just because they were going to Disney World [Walt Disney World, Orlando, Florida], and I was gonna get this free trip to Disney World and quit promptly after.  And there was, you know, the black girl and the black boy in the choir.  You know, we were the ones, and this woman came up to me her name was Mary, Mary Duke Trent Biddle Semans [Mary Semans].  And she was one of the Dukes, huge hair, never forget her.  Coming up to me after a concert saying, you know, "Who are you?"  And, and I, I said, you know, "I'm [HistoryMaker] Charles Randolph-Wright."  She said, "What are you doing here?"  I said, "I'm going to be a doctor," she said, "No you're not, no you're not."  She said, "Come to my office," still no idea who this woman was and so the next day I went to her office, and I'm sitting in the--then when it dawns on me that she's a Duke.  And she is this person that controls what happens here at the university.  And so she said, "I want you to meet a friend of mine, and there's a guy coming from England," because her husband [James H. Semans] then was president at School of the Arts [University of North Carolina School of the Arts, Winston-Salem, North Carolina].  And she said, you know, "I wonder if you should go to School of the Arts?"  I said, "No, I want to be here."  And so she said, "I have somebody I want you to meet."  So this guy came through, and he had a program this study program in London [England] and auditioned me.  And the next thing I knew I got in this program to go study in London my junior year.
Story_ID: 373037
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're on your way to England, to London [England] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah so, so because of Mary, Mary Semans, I get in this program in London.  And I go and spend my junior year--well, the summer and then my first semester junior year in this program in London.  And I get to study with people from the Royal Shakespeare Company.  And I get to, to do these things that I never even imagined it was my first time out of the country.  It was an amazing time, it was 1976 in London which was the height of the punk movement.  So I was hanging out with all of these punk kids on the street who were middle class kids pretending they were, you know, they were downtrodden and depressed.  I, I talk about how, how England was so great for me because I just felt like a person there.  And people say well, you know, but English, the British.  I said, yes, but the British hated everybody.  They didn't hate me because I was black they hated everybody is not British and once you proved yourself then you became then you became part of what their world was.  And I feel still in this country no matter what we do no matter how much we are, you know, you can be Oprah Winfrey and still not get buzzed in the store.  You know, you will not be--no matter what you are not taken--you are taken at face value, you know.  You are not able to rise above that--there is a certain level there's that that's ceiling that glass ceiling that stops you that stops it.  And I'm forever trying to break that down but I, I was just in London, and I realized that being there really formed me.  That was another--my family gave me this great, great foundation and I got to London, and the people there taught me and told me that I could do anything.  And that I could be anything, and I was in a production there of 'The Tempest' [William Shakespeare] where I played Ferdinand, who's the young lover in 'The Tempest' a role I would never get in the United States unless it was an all-black production.  So I, I remember going to see plays and seeing productions and going to see the play 'The Duchess of Malfi' [John Webster] and the Duchess was a black woman.  And was not 'The Black Duchess of Malfi' it was 'The Duchess of Malfi.'  And it was a real important time for me in realizing that, that shift of to be that person that talented person.  That artist not just that black artists but that artist of the world.  And studying there with these people who saw me that way and who didn't deal--who dealt with race in a different way.  As I said to you earlier, you know, colonialism and slavery are very, very different things.  So the way they dealt with me there was this is, this is this, this talent.
Story_ID: 373038
Speaker 1: I met this woman who was my voice teacher there who I became very, very close to and, and I guess she was like Diahann [HistoryMaker Diahann Carroll] this woman Stella Quiley [ph.] was very she'd been a, you know, a star in London [England].  And had done all these different things, and her husband was the big actor in London.  And was in a play with Albert Finney right then and I would go and hang out with--all these guys were in the company [Royal Shakespeare Company] when I was a student.  Albert Finney, Tom Conti, Tom Courtenay, Derek Jacobi, all those people and I was this kid around them who knew--I had no idea who they were, you know.  I was completely ignorant of that, and it's so amazing as the years have passed Roger Rees was in the company.  And I ended up directing this show at his Williamstown Theatre Festival [Williamstown, Massachusetts] two summers ago.  I mean that kind of years later to see this.  I was just in London last week--my film 'Preaching to the Choir' was selected by the American embassy to be the film that they screen for Black History Month.  And they flew me over and it--I didn't even realize what he was, and I'm in preproduction on another movie, and I hadn't had time to think about it.  And my friends kept going, "Charles [HistoryMaker Charles Randolph-Wright], this is the embassy this is a big deal," you know.  So I went over and that and I invited Stella to come to this event and on stage I had to do a Q and A afterwards.  And I said, you know, "I realize tonight that who I am is because of this woman who's sitting in here, part of--," I said, "I am back here with my film but, you know, years ago I was a student here this little colored boy from South Carolina who had no clue what England was. And I had this woman who showed me and told me that I could do and be anything."  And I said, "It's one thing when you get that from your family.  You know, but then you get to a point where oh, that's just my family.  Then you get to college, and you find this world that is, even more, racist than you imagined.  And all of a sudden you go really into the world you end up going out of the country and then you're told, 'Yes, you can do this.  Yes, you can have this.'"  So, when I went back to college [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina], I experienced it differently.
Story_ID: 373039
Speaker 1: I didn't allow anything to get in my way.  You know, and the, the organizations that we started are still there.  The black, you know, all the black groups that we did.  And I kept saying to people, "I'm doing this culturally.  I'm not trying to do this to separate us; there are white kids in our productions."  I said, "But you're missing our culture.  You're missing our voices, and that's why we have what we have."  So I got the, the university, the drama department, the student union all those people became involved with us.  I said, "I don't want to do it apart from you.  I want you to help us do it, you know, but I want to tell our stories."  And that's when I knew that I was a storyteller.  And that's what I had to do, and that's what I would spend my life doing.  So I came back to Duke [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina] after my junior year.  That was the first semester, and I came back and did several other things there and ended up becoming one of the first three drama majors at Duke because they didn't even have a drama program.  They had a program, and then they made it a major, and there were three of us who were the first three.  Was just back at Duke a few weeks ago 'cause now I'm on the artistic board at Duke.  I was back for this dedication and they re-did the old theater that I started in, and you know sitting in there just thinking wow look at this look at the change.  And I'm so grateful for what I got at Duke because it wasn't easy.  And if I'd gone to a university that had been simpler, you know I would've been caught up, and I wouldn't have established my voice.  I would've had the voice that everyone else has which what is what happens especially in art school.  You come out, and I tell kids all the time, be sure you get another education besides your art education.  Be sure that you get everything because you have to be a student of the world, you have to know everything to do what we do.  And I, I'm so grateful because I didn't know that but now I realize that what I got they taught me how to maneuver.  They, they taught me how to be in, in an impossible situation and make it work for you.  They taught me that something 'cause Duke has one of the most gorgeous campuses on the planet.  They taught me that something that stunning can also be horrifying, it can be ugly.  That the outside--you know, you have to deal with both the outside and the inside.  And then that you can take something that perhaps is ugly, and you can change it.  And I saw us change that, that school I saw us change that campus.  I saw us make a difference the ones of us that stayed.  The other people that came--it's a very different university now.  And needless to say, it's gotten a lot of attention (laughter) lately with what's happened.  But it's, it was funny because a fr-, I, I was getting calls about the lacrosse team what happened and to and to talk on some radio talk shows.  And ended up doing a lot of them, and I found out I am on the--there's an alumni website of notable alumni from Duke.  And on that website are all the black people on it are athletes except for me.  And I thought this is so ridiculous--one of my best friends from college is the top--one of the top cardiologists in the country.  Why isn't he there, you know?  Why aren't these other people there?  But it's not just racism it's what it's what we're exposed to in this world.  You know, the entertainment industry anything, you know, the sports industry where our volume is turned up higher than anyone else's.  We have the same issues we have all the same things, but, you know, we're a lot louder.  So, you know, I accept that again that responsibility of being, you know, here I am again the only one.  That's, that's been that pattern that I started fighting, you know, fighting long ago.  When I was in England in that program there were just a few of us, you know.  So when I came back to Duke, I was really ready to tackle it and then to tackle the world--
Story_ID: 373040
Speaker 1: So I went to New York [New York], and I said okay, I p- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Wait, you went to New York after graduation?
Speaker 1: So after graduation, so I came back to Duke [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina], we had started these things I did everything imaginable in theater (laughter).  You know, finished up my credits and as I said pre-med was the major, so I had all my courses physics both organic chemistry--all the things I needed to be a pre-med major.  And again I went through the exact same thing I went through in high school [York High School, York, South Carolina] because here I was, from Duke, black kid from the South.  And I was a religion and theater major who was pre-med applying to med schools, and they went crazy because they thought, oh he'll be humane.  You know, what a great doctor this will be this whole thing so again my friends were killing themselves trying to get schools to see them.  And I was getting, you know, offer after offer to come to this school to come to that school and I couldn't decide what to do.  You know, I went to I, you know, I visited I went to Harvard [Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts] thinking do I go do this what do I do?  And I got back to New York and the same day I got my--I had auditioned for the show 'Pippin' and got in it.  And it was my first professional role and which was a tour which was outside the city.  And I thought okay that's my sign.  And I'm going to do this until--'cause I can always go back to school but I can't, you know, I'm twenty, I'm twenty-one I can't always have this career.  I'm not going to be this young, I can't do this.  So I ended up, you know, going after this performing career and started it and got my first job and it was, you know, and I've worked ever since.
Speaker 2: Okay.  (Laughter) So you graduated from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So there, I'm done (laughter).
Speaker 2: No (laughter) you graduated from Duke in '78 [1978]?
Speaker 1: Seventy-eight [1978]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --but I actually left Duke--I finished--I threw all my credits together and I finished in December 1977, but I was class of '78 [1978]. So, that's when I went to New York in January to start auditioning and to see if someone says I can do it.  If I get a job or even close to a job, then I'll do this.  If not, I was gonna go to med school or grad school or something else in the fall 'cause I had done my med boards.  I had done, you know, the--I had done all my boards just in case and, and had these offers.  So I was trying to decide do I go to school or do I go after this career.  And then when I got, you know, this first job I went, that's it.
Story_ID: 373041
Speaker 1: What did your family think?
Speaker 2: Oh, they went crazy I mean it's, you know, 'cause I'd gotten, you know, I was an A.B. Duke Scholar [Angier B. Duke Memorial Scholar] at Duke [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina].  You know, I ended up graduating with honors.  I had these med schools after me it was ideal.  I mean, that's what I was supposed to do.  I had the--my, my path was exactly what it should be, you know.  And, and I thought this is--and I couldn't decide.  I was, it was, so--that was the worst summer I've ever had before trying to make that decision.  And my mother [Ruth Lillian Lucas Wright Johnson], who has always been very, very supportive of me and I thought, and she was very cautious.  She was really concerned about me having, you know, a life 'cause you know what this life is in the entertainment industry.  She was very, very concerned about that--knowing that I obviously had this other career ahead of me, and it was right there and, you know, in my hand.  And why would I take something that is so unsure?  But she said to me because I was at home [York, South Carolina] and I was miserable this one summer as I was trying to decide what to do.  And she just looked at me, and she said, "Nothing is worth your sanity, nothing."  And, and that's when I went I'm doing this I'm doing this 'cause I looked at other relatives who were so unhappy--successful and so unhappy.  And I thought I don't want that I don't want that and so the success, of course, is important it something that I wanted.  We all want, but it was not--again, a man's reach should exceed his grasp, you know. And so I was like I have to try this, this is my pursuit.  I will try this, this is what I will do, and then I got that first job [in 'Pippin'].  And so that's when I thought okay, okay I can do it.  You know, they--I must have some modicum of talent (laughter).  You know, I fooled somebody to give me this job and so that started my whole trajectory in the entertainment industry--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) you know, as a performer.
Story_ID: 373042
Speaker 1: Okay what was your next performance after 'Pippin'?
Speaker 2: Actually right after 'Pippin' I ended up--I was walking down the street, you know, no job.  Trying to think, okay, what I'm going to do?  Ran into some friends and they said, "Oh we're going to audition for this disco group," this was 1978, '79 [1979], '79 [1979].  And I went to this audition next thing I knew I was in this singing group.  We were on the plane to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] on 'American Bandstand,' you know, we had three gold records (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What group was this?
Speaker 2: I know (laughter).
Speaker 1: What group was this (laughter)?
Speaker 2: It's so funny because every time I, I talk about this everyone goes I have to know what this is and I in my bio it says that it'll remain nameless 'cause I now I never tell people what group I'm in.  So they're always trying to figure out.  Well you weren't one of the Village People, we know that.  They're always trying to figure out what was the group it's in but--there was a--TK Records [Hialeah, Florida] was like this big disco label. And there were all these different groups that had hit records on this label that were like big gold records.  And, and so but they were fake groups that we created and would end up touring.  And I literally saw the world we went all over the world touring.  And there were several, several records that were big records and that's, that's all I'll tell you (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: 'Cause now all you have to do is go 'cause, everybody's been on my when I was shooting something I was doing one project.  And it was the crew--the crew decided we're going to find out what group you were in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Find out--nobody's found out yet?
Speaker 2: --you know, because it wasn't our name.  So it wasn't like Charles Wright [HistoryMaker Charles Randolph-Wright] and the so-and-so--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know, part of a couple of groups and, and because of it and there were like some more minor disco hits.  There was one group I worked with--one singer [Anita Ward] I worked with though that had a major, major record.  And this is sort of how my career has been--I got a call from our manager.  I was in this other group, and he said listen this song is about to break.  We need you to go and help her, you know.  We, we had done this song in the studio in the studio as a joke.  You know, we just thought it was funny no one ever thought it would be this record.  It was climbing the charts, and it was predicted to be like number one the next week.  So, said, "You've got to take this artist and go with her to L.A. 'cause she's gotta do all the shows," 'cause you would go do 'American Bandstand,' 'The Midnight Special,' this show called 'Splash' [ph.] you would go do all these shows.  So we went literally I took two other friends with me we learn the music on the plane.  You know, heading out, listening to this song going, this song is ridiculous, but it's great, you know.  And the woman who was the singer had never--she has sung in church.  And she was a schoolteacher from Memphis [Tennessee] had never performed like this.  Wanted to wear a white evening gown on 'Midnight Special' this was the height of spandex.  You know, the disco--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: I was like, oh no, no, no.  So I had to take her shopping, you know.  I had to find her some--I said you have to wear lame, you have to wear gold something.  I was twenty-one, you know, and going but my, my friend Barbara [ph.] who's--her name is Avery [ph.] now, but Barbara had been a designer.  I had stayed at her apartment when I first got to New York [New York], and she was a fa-, a designer.  And so she would send me to get things for her.  So I kind of knew about stuff because of her which, which really stunned me.  So I was like all of a sudden going okay we need to get this, this, this and this.  They were like, "How do you know this?"  I'm like, "I don't know, but I know it."  So I ended up--we ended up going to California.  I staged all of the stuff that she did.  I knew that she was going to be really nervous--so in, in Memphis I bought these bells like, you know, the little souvenir bells.  I bought like the store out of everything that they had and just got them and put them all around.  I said, "Anytime you get nervous just pick this up and just ring it," 'cause the song was 'Ring My Bell.'  And it became like one of the top disco songs ever--people used to do bell ringing contests (laughter).  I mean it was crazy we, we started this whole sensation because she was--I, I tried to figure out how do I--what do I do, you know, how do I make her comfortable.  And that started my, my career.
Story_ID: 373043
Speaker 1: Okay, so we were talking about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, my, my disco life (laughter).
Speaker 1: Your disco life (laughter), and the bells ringing, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so--bells ringing and all these things, so I started choreographing all these different acts.  And I was on--I was in this one group, and we were on 'American Bandstand.'  And this is how it started we were on 'American Bandstand' it turned out they didn't have the right take for us, and so we had to redo it.  And the, the choreographer was back in New York [New York], and we were all like what are we going to do.  It was two guys--two men, two women and then the main singer, and so I redid it on the spot.  I said okay, so I just thought up something.  And 'American Bandstand' had this spiral staircase on the set, and I had the two guys--we slid down the staircase in the opening of the number like fell on the floor.  She stepped on top of us 'cause, you know, I'm theater, right? The kids went crazy.  I'll never forget Dick Clark saying that there were five times they had to stop the tape because kids were screaming so much.  And this was one of the times because of what we did, and it's a--and I put that together.  You know, out of just sheer being what do we do what we do?  It's that last minute and because of that, I started getting all these jobs choreographing like disco, disco acts, and disco, you know, things.  So I was performing with different groups choreographing groups and making up all of these groups 'cause you would have a singer who would have one hit song.  And, you know, so they'd need a group to go and be because you had the dance on all the shows they'd need somebody to go do it.  And they would call us, you know, we'd go make up (laughter) act like we're in the group and do it.  On one of my trips back and then, I was back and forth in New York trying to be a serious actor.  So I'm doing disco having just studied Shakespeare [William Shakespeare].  Having played in 'The Tempest' [William Shakespeare] having done, you know, worked in 'Hamlet' [William Shakespeare], having done these things but realizing I'm not going to get this if I'm being a person of color.  I have to sing and dance to get a job I can't be the actor that I want to be.  So I made money, I saw the world, and it was great because it wasn't like I was, you know, Milli Vanilli--no one or, you know, it wasn't my name no one knew who I was.  I was just in these groups, and I came back on one of my trips, and we would have--it was great because we would go out.  And we would come back to the city and on one of my trips back in the city I got this call like late at night to come in for this audition the next day.  And I went in for this workshop that was called 'Big Dreams' [ph.].  And so we did this workshop, and there were these incredible people in this workshop, you know.  And all the sudden and what--it turned into 'Dreamgirls.'
Story_ID: 373044
Speaker 1: And so it was Jennifer Holliday.  And I mean it was Jennifer's--I remember hearing Jennifer Holliday sing 'I'm Telling You I'm Not Going' ['And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going'] at a table putting on makeup I mean (laughter) she was just I thought it was it's still one of the most incredible experiences I've ever, ever had.  She was and is extraordinary and in that company--so that turned into the musical.  We went to Boston [Massachusetts], then we came back to New York [New York], and in that company was [HistoryMaker] Phylicia Rashad, who was in the chorus.  She and I were partners in the chorus. Vanessa Bell Calloway, Vondie Curtis-Hall, all these people came out of this, out of that company.  It was a really extraordinary show and, and we knew it was extraordinary then, but now especially I realized how it changed theater.  It changed this image, especially this image of people of color 'cause it got to the tell this extr-, our story an extraordinary story but as I said we were in nice clothes, you know, we always in burlap on stage. We're always in overalls I said I don't I won't do any more shows unless we're in nice clothes that it, you know.  And when we were doing 'Dreamgirls,' it was this thing that you would always do your nightclub acts.  You know, people at night, like late at night, eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock, that's how I met Carole Ione [Carole Ione Lewis] that I mentioned before.  You would do a nightclub act a different club there are all these great clubs around New York.  And I directed a friend's act and ended up directing everybody shows in the show.  Because I just had this out, outrageous sensibility and I would make them do ridiculous things in these club acts.  And I became known for doing these acts, and that's really how I started directing because I was in the show and I was playing around with it.  I left 'Dreamgirls,' went to Hollywood as an actor and did a lot of different television shows--did a little--you know, did film different, different work as an actors.  But I really never liked acting.  I enjoyed being an--you know, I liked--no, that's wrong.  I liked being an actor--I liked acting.  I hated being an actor that's it.  To say it the right way--I disliked being this piece of me.  What they, what they told you; you had to do.  And at that time when I was in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], which was '80s [1980s], early '80s [1980s] mid-'80s [1980s] as a young black actor, young male actor of color.  The only--I said the only roles that I could do I was in jail, out of jail or going and that was it.  And I remember my mom [Ruth Lillian Lucas Wright Johnson]--I was on 'Hill Street Blues,' and my mother calling me saying, "Can't you speak English on television? What is this? Where's your degree?"  Well, your mother's an English professor, where's this background.  And there were no roles for us.  There were so few roles for us where we did actually get to be, you know, where you saw different things.  You just saw us in the hood.  That was--and then the hood movies happened, and it was that realm.  And so while I was there as an actor and I was working as an actor I was--I never hung out with the actors.  I always hung out with the crew, I always hung out with the writing team because I've always wanted to be on the other side of it.  And I'm, I'm grateful now that I'm not coming out of school now 'cause I would go right to writing and directing.  Because when I came out of school [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina], I thought you had to do what I did first.  I thought you had to--that you needed to know everything.  You know, I thought you should really be a performer.  You should be a dancer.  You should be a singer.  You should be--because then you really know there's no bull.  Everyone that you--no one can, can pull anything across me.  I've done it you can't tell me you can make that costume change I did it in seventeen seconds.  You can't tell me that you can't (unclear).  I've done, I've done it, and I've worked in every medium as a performer, so I know what that is.  And if I had gotten out of school now I would've gone right to writing and directing 'cause the opportunities are there now that weren't there when I came when I got out of school.  And then, you know, Spike [Spike Lee] and John Singleton and all them happened, and I was--I tried to do that, but I was caught up because I wanted to tell my family stories.  And they didn't want to see that they wanted to--Hollywood wanted the hood stories.  Now they started buying the stories off of me they started buying some of my screenplays, but they wouldn't make them.  You know, they go, uh, this is unrealistic, you know, this upper-class family the southern black bourgeoisie (laughter) which is what--I, I, you know, that's my genre.  It was they didn't want to tell those stories.  Now and I said I, I can tell any stories, and I love the urban stories I think they're really--all of these are important, but you're only allowing us to be seen in one way.  We're only, we're only getting one slice one, one small aspect of the picture, I wanna do more than that.
Story_ID: 373045
Speaker 1: Luckily I was an actor--I did a lot of TV commercials and the commercials paid for me to write.  And I started writing and the first piece that I did which was about [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis.  We sold to Castle Rock [Castle Rock Entertainment], it never happened, but I, I started getting that kind of recognition from different people that I was a writer.  You know, I had already started directing.  I'd started directing shows 'cause I started that back in 'Dreamgirls.'  The video age happened, so I was doing music videos, you know.  Disliked doing that because all the people--these record company heads, you know, I loved the fact that you have all these people run record companies, and they can't read music.  You know, they know nothing about music.  They were again doing the stereotypical images of us, which I didn't want to do.  So I was constantly getting in fights (laughter) with the company 'cause I'd wanna change this artist's image, and the artist would want that so would I end up being stuck between the artist and the company.  So I, I've always had, you know, my, my family taught me well, you know, of being that of breaking down those doors again of trying to give images, images that we've not seen.  I would, I would talk about--I used to do these lectures at a university out in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], and I would say, "Talk about stories.  Talk about television shows and what happens on them."  I said, "Name me," and this was '80s [1980s] again I said, "'Miami Vice.'"  I said, "Where does Philip Michael Thomas live?  You always see where Don Johnson goes, you see his, his, you know, where he lives," and I then I started naming every black character on television.  I said, "Do, do you ever see them go home?   Do you see their grandparents?  Do you see their great-grandparents?  Do you hear them talking about their history?  Where they come from? You don't." And I said, "And on a sitcom, you'll see us in a house, but we're all living in one big house," (laughter).  I said, "Where are we?  Where is that?  I wanna show those things I've not seen."  So it, it was the--my Duke [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina] education completely prepared me for this world that's run by this smaller group of people who say, well this is how it is, this is what it is.  And it's like, no it's not.
Story_ID: 373046
Speaker 1: The film that I did, 'Preaching to the Choir,' that was out last year.  I had--the, my producers had a rude awakening in Hollywood because they thought, oh, you know, they're just going to embrace this.  And they were saying, "Well, where did you shoot this?"  They said, "Harlem [New York, New York]," they said, "Harlem doesn't look like this."  I said, "The Harlem that you portray doesn't look like this because the Harlem that you portray has cars burning in the background for no reason, it has graffiti on every building."  I said, "But the Harlem I know, the buildings--there's no building in Harlem over seventeen stories.  So the light in Harlem is like Greenwich Village [New York, New York] that's why it looks that way that's why you think it's so beautiful because it is but you never project that."  Someone told me when they did 'New Jack City' that they added trash to the streets, you know.  And they would do it--I mean that, that thing of those images of this is what we think it is.  Well, I went over to London [England] for 'Preaching to the Choir' and people--there are a million black people in London.  So I had a lot of the filmmakers and different people I was talking to them, and they were stunned by the film because of how Harlem looked.  You know, because they have this image that the media has given them of what, what Harlem looks like, what the South looks like, you know, that's black or white, you know.  What, what all of these elements are and they're just so narrowly defined but we are rapidly becoming a minority country, you know, and we have to deal with this.  So I saw early on that I was not liking the images.  First of all, that I had to--as an actor what I had to do and then I thought, I've--the only way I can change it is by creating.  So I have to write these stories. I have to write about the people I know.  I have to--I have to direct things where for example I did of production of the Moliere play, 'Tartuffe' where I sat it on a black family in the '50s [1950s] and didn't change one word of the script.  And it sort of became this thing everyone still talks about this production because it crossed all the boundaries.  The people who loved Moliere--the Moliere society came from France and saw the production and they say, "Moliere would've loved this."  How thrilling was that, I mean that's the thing how do we tell our stories?  But our stories are still part of, of this one--of this fabric of all the stories. You know, then you know when I, I go to Brazil you talk about where, where my favorite place.  And I love Brazil because first of all--in Brazil they're all Brazilians first.  Then they're everything else, then they're afro-brasileiro de 'neiro [Rio de Janeiro, Brazil], they are all these other things, but they're Brazilians.  And here, we're everything else before we're American, you know.  We--don't that bond that we share as Americans and especially us because how we were brought here it's this certain energy.  Even though that happen in Brazil, it has a different texture and not to say they don't have racism, but it's a different texture.  Because they all have something that they celebrate together.  And occasionally we do that--9/11 [September 11, 2001] we did, you know, there are certain times when we do celebrate that but what I find discouraging is that we don't.  And I think the way that we must is by telling our stories and realizing that even though I'm watching this story that's about a Jewish family--that's my family. Oh, I'm watching this story that's this Asian, you know, this Asian family in, in San Francisco [California].  Wow, that's exactly what I went through with my cousin.  That's what I went through with my mother, as opposed to oh they're Asian, that's not me.
Story_ID: 373047
Speaker 1: Well, let me ask you about the play.  Well, I want you to tell me about the play, 'Senor Discretion' ['Senor Discretion Himself,' Frank Loesser]?
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Why do you laugh?
Speaker 2: No it's just funny that, that you picked that, yes.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Tell me about that because they didn't first think that you should direct this play is that right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter).  Oh, there's so many things I don't know where--I mean where do I even start?  'Blue' [Charles Randolph-Wright] was the first one, I mean that's the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We're gone talk about 'Blue' next.
Speaker 2: I did a production of 'Guys and Dolls' at Arena Stage [Washington, D.C.] for 2000 we opened right in 2000.  And Molly Smith, who's the Arena artistic director, who I adore, who's my, my theater soulmate.  Molly said, "I want you to do a musical here."  And the theater's in the round and it, it's an extraordinary theater.  And of history, it's one of the oldest regional theaters.  And it was the fiftieth--coming up on the fiftieth anniversary of 'Guys and Dolls.'  So I did this production, Maurice Hines [HistoryMaker Maurice Hines, Jr.], Maurice Hines played Nathan [Nathan Detroit].  And it was so interesting as we were auditioning because the choreographer Ken Roberson is black.  Maurice, one of the stars, is black, and I'm, you know, directing it.  So agents would only send black actors to audition for this, and we had to keep telling them, no it's not a black version of 'Guys and Dolls.'  It's 'Guys and Dolls.' It's New York [New York] in the '50s [1950s]--New York in the '50s [1950s] had all kinds of people in it, and that's the way I'm showing this.  So I did this production it became the, the biggest selling production in the Arena's fifty-year history in their history, and it was their big history almost fifty years and also 'Guys and Dolls.'  'Guys and Dolls' ended up turning into a national tour, became the fiftieth anniversary tour, it's nominated for a Grammy [Grammy Award].  It was, it was--went all over the--it went all over the country it was fantastic.  When it went back to Charlotte [North Carolina], they gave me the key to the city, and it was [HistoryMaker] Charles Randolph-Wright Day in Charlotte.  So I think my family finally got over that I'm not a doctor. As a matter of fact, speaking of that I have to tell you something my mom [Ruth Lillian Lucas Wright Johnson] said, and I'm, I'm trying to think now when it was it may have been 'Blue.'  But she when, after, after production she just looked at me and said, "You know, you have healed far more people with what you've done than you ever would have as a doctor."  So I mean I thought, you know, now I can just go make furniture now, you know (laughter).  But so 'Guys and Dolls' we did this it was a national tour which was one of the greatest experiences of my life.  Maurice Hines was one of my teachers when I first got here.  And typically mentor relationships don't end well none of my other ones (laughter) in theater have.  But Maurice is one of my best friends I literally talk to him every morning.  And to do this production with him was extraordinary, it's was one of the greatest times I've ever had.  And watching audiences especially watching kids see this old-fashioned musical, but seeing Asian, black, seeing everyone in it.  And that was real 'cause New York was like that in the '50s [1950s]. I wouldn't have done it if, if--I said, "I'm not going to do anything that's wrong."  Like I didn't let the policeman be black in this 'cause they wouldn't have been in that neighborhood but the thing that we did was authentic and I and I was so thrilled with that.
Story_ID: 373048
Speaker 1: Jo Loesser [Jo Sullivan Loesser]--Frank Loesser wrote, wrote 'Guys and Dolls.'  And his wife--his widow is Jo Loesser, and she runs the estate.  And, and she was a performer, extraordinary performer herself.  So I mean, and they told me Jo was going to see the production, and I was, I was so 'cause I thought what if she hate this, and she can stop this the whole thing.  Well, she saw it and then called me and said, "I want to have dinner with you," and we did we had dinner, and she said, "This is one of the best productions I've ever seen of, of this show in fifty years."  And she says, "I have something to send you," and she sent me this script it was three hundred pages, and it was Frank Loesser's final script.  And he had never--which it never been produced she'd been trying to get it produced but people kept telling her it was--that it didn't work.  And that it was politically incorrect because it was this Mexican fable, and I loved it, I thought, this is fantastic.  So I started working on it I brought in this group Culture Clash to redo the book.  And we and I convinced Arena [Arena Stage, Washington, D.C.], well, Arena was like, we have to do this.  So we did it in Arena Stage, it won the Helen Hayes Award, and it was, and it's Frank Loesser's last musical ['Senor Discretion Himself'].  Now what amazed me was that the lack of--in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] we get the attention, but the lack of attention in New York [New York].  That here is Frank Loesser, one of the greatest, greatest composers--theater composers of our time and they paid no attention to this.  We got, you know; it was this energy there were other articles and I won't mention them but about different people that were out at the same time, like in The New York Times, and I thought where is--you don't have to talk about me, Frank Loesser.  Where is this about Frank Loesser?  This is extraordinary, this is like when you find a Picasso [Pablo Picasso].  You know, that no one knew--I mean, he's one of our great composers.  Why are you not going crazy for this?  But this musical was Latino, you know.  It was a whole different thing, and we did it.  We did a, a workshop of it in New York, and people were saying, well, it's too ethnic, you know.  You're not supposed to be doing this, you know, you--you're directing a Frank Loesser musical, you know, I'm supposed to do just black shows.  And we've had this struggle of getting this produced because of that, but we're not stopping it's actually going open in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], and then we'll come back to New York.  But it's, it's an extraordinary musical, and audiences went crazy.  We won the Helen Hayes Award, but yet we still have that fight because of what it is.  And Frank did it authentically I mean, the music is, is Mexican music and it's so interesting 'cause the town that's about is near Oaxaca [Mexico], which is been having all the trouble recently with the teachers and the protests there.  So it's, it's the world of this is very present to me, and the story of this was written by Budd Schulberg.
Story_ID: 373049
Speaker 1: Budd Schulberg wrote 'On the Waterfront,' 'A Face in the Crowd.'  I get this phone call telling me Budd's coming to the show.  I said, "What do you mean he's coming to the show?" So Budd came to see--Budd was ninety-one then.  He came to the show, he's about--it's almost his ninety-third birthday so he came I loved it I ended up going out 'cause he lives out in the Hamptons [New York].  We ended up talking about, and I said this is what I want to do with this it and, you know, it was hard because we didn't have Frank [Frank Loesser] anymore I was like, how do I really do this?  And so Budd started talking to me and helping me, and we started this friendship and, and this collaboration, this artist collaboration it's been incredible.  And I was sitting there, and he would tell me Brando [Marlon Brando] stories and Eastwood [Clint Eastwood] stories I mean, just amazing.  And Budd started the Watts Writers project [Watts Writers Workshop] right after the riots in Watts [Los Angeles, California]--that whole project he started.  The Harlem [New York, New York] project I mean he's always been he made them put them these, these men of color in 'On the Waterfront,' you know because they were working on the docks.  And he's always been this I mean he's an activist, unbelievable, you know, the only writer inducted to the Boxing Hall of Fame [International Boxing Hall of Fame, Canastota, New York].  He and Spike [Spike Lee] have been working on this film about Joe Louis for ten years, and Spike still can't get funded, you know.  And so I said to him, "You must have something I can have," and he has the film--he has this book called 'Sanctuary V' [Budd Schulberg] that I read that blew me away.  And he also did a screenplay, so I've optioned that and that's not my next my project after next. That I'm doing with Janet Yang who produced 'Joy Luck Club' ['The Joy Luck Club'] and it's again it's such a struggle to get this made, and they're like, "You're working with Budd Schulberg?"  A month ago, they did a thing at NYU [New York University, New York, New York] where they did a screening of 'On the Waterfront' and did a conversation with Budd Schulberg afterwards.  And I interviewed him on stage shows Budd, you know, just us talking and we're two artists.  You know, and we're now great friends, and he happens to be, you know, ninety-three (laughter).  And then this guy came up in a whole different realm, but we're great artists.  So because again of my family and my background I, I refuse to stay in these limits that, that they place constantly place upon me.  'Senor Discretion' ['Senor Discretion Himself'], you can't do that, 'Tartuffe' [Moliere], you can't do that, 'Sanctuary,' no, that's not, you know, do a hood movie.  You know, it's that--I--even when I did 'Preaching to the Choir,' which is a gospel based film.  You know, I really change the world of it I changed how it looked.  I changed what Harlem was, and I was really proud of that, and people got it.  And I--they were, they all said, you know, and they all were so appreciative coming up to me thanking me for it s-, you know, looking that way being that way.
Story_ID: 373050
Speaker 1: Well, you're even changing--well, barbershop, you know, we've seen two different (laughter) versions of barbershop, but your barbershop is, is different because--?
Speaker 2: It's the real barbershop.  It's the--I mean in my play there's five, ten minute of what's in the movies.  You know, but that's what sells I mean the humor and the--you know that, that kind of energy.  But the reason I did--it was based--'Cuttin' Up' [Charles Randolph-Wright] is based on a book ['Cuttin' Up: Wit and Wisdom from Black Barber Shops'], Craig Marberry, where he went around and interviewed these barbers all over the country.  And I read this one story just, just so affected me which happened in Atlanta [Georgia] and it was a barbershop in Atlanta.  And this young woman goes into this barbershop, and she says, you know, "Excuse me.  I don't mean to interrupt you, but I, I watch you I come by here, and I see how you always wearing a tie and how you how you treat people in, in your business.  And how great it is," and she says, "I have three sons, and I wondered if I can bring them by and watch you."  He said, "Watch me? Why?" She says, "I want to expose my sons to a black man doing something positive."  And then he talks about how these three kids come to the barbershop and spend the day with him.  And he says I don't know what I did--I don't know if I changed 'em but for that day they saw that they could be something else.  Then they 'cause they lived in the Eagan Homes [Atlanta, Georgia], or somewhere, you know, in the projects in Atlanta.  And he said they came in that day, and they saw for that day that they could be a doctor or a lawyer or an architect.  It was a moment in the show we did this as he says this all the guys in the show came out on stage in suits.  And they're standing just as the edge of the stage and people would go crazy.  They would go crazy and then a friend of mine told me that one of the reviews said (laughter) 'cause I don't read reviews, thank god.  He said one of the reviews said, "You can't have seven men in a barbershop in suits, that's ridiculous."  Because their view of us they, they don't see that.  And they've not been in it, but it's the arrogance to think--I'm not going tell you that in a, you know, Russian barbershop that something doesn't exist if I haven't been in there, you know.  Now I've been in some London [England] barbershops so I can say maybe something about that.  But, you know, how dare you say that something doesn't exist because it's not your experience, and you're quite--you know, and that's what happens.  You know, it happened to me on 'Blue' [Charles Randolph-Wright] too saying that, that family's not realistic.
Story_ID: 373051
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What do you want to talk about, about in 'Blue' [Charles Randolph-Wright]?
Speaker 2: I think the thing that was the--first of all personally it was the first time that my entire family came back together.  I--when we opened all my cousins I mean my whole family came to this show, and there are elements of all my family in this show.  I mentioned my cousin Rick [ph.], who's a doctor now in, in Norfolk [Virginia] and Rick, was the one with the huge afro who was sort of--I guess he's the one I wanted to be.  He and his sister, Roberta [ph.], was my idols growing up.  I wanted to be just like them Roberta, who could do play anything on the piano was the smartest person I've ever seen who was, you know, became a lawyer.  And still is, you know, there my they're my brothers and sisters, you know.  They--Rick had a conversation with me in the funeral home [Wright Funeral Home, York, South Carolina] that I lifted completely I mean like ver-, verbatim and put in the show.  And I'll never forget that night hearing it 'cause he was talking about seducing women in the hearse (laughter).  And I'll never forget that night at the show hearing him screaming in the audience as this happened because this is something that happened between us forty years ago, you know.  And I (laughter) put it on stage, but I literally exposed my family not completely in a positive light because, you know, all too often when you see especially us portrayed if it is something that is positive everything positive.  So you don't believe it, you know, you don't see the difficulty in being positive.  You don't see the difficulty in trying to raise your kids correctly and trying to do all those things.  You don't see the a-, you just see it happening simply, so people don't believe that, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And then the other side of the spectrum is, you know, as I said the projects that are just what they considered urban or ghetto, you know.  And then even when an urban family, you know, like you don't see those families--like in 'Boyz n the Hood' where you see that character, that mom trying so hard to raise her kid that right way.  I mean, they don't want to see that, you know, they'd rather see the crack addicted, you know.  They would rather see the prostitutes the other energy, but there're so many other people there that you never see.  So with 'Blue' I had the opportunity and, and by using my family (laughter) and exploiting my family to show, to show people a world that they didn't know.  And I--and, you know, 'Blue' played all over the country, and I would watch audiences I, I watched them moved by this.  I watched--remember the first night in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] I was so nervous.  And two people came up to me at the end of it, you know, like a twenty-year-old black man and a sixty-year-old white man, and they both had tears in their eyes.  And the white man said to me, "You just taught me how to do with my mother."  And I was in my whole my own racism of thinking this is a black play, you know.  And this person, you know, it was extraordinary for me to realize and that's what happened all along but especially when we play Roundabout [Roundabout Theatre Company] in New York [New York].  These audiences were stunned because, you know, I had, I've, I've had (laughter) I had white women all over the country telling me that they're just like my mother [Ruth Lillian Lucas Wright Johnson].  You know, because they are and we're just like other people that's all of that.  And so the thing that I think the play did more than anything else was to again have people see the commonality of us and at the same time see the uniqueness of what a family like my family--how they work.  You know, what we did--I mean there are extreme things my mother used to have us playing croquet in white linen out on the front yard, you know.  I said, you know, if I put this in this, you wouldn't believe me.  You would say oh this is impossible 'cause, you know, people are thinking that things this one who didn't cook who brought in these, these (laughter) who brought in this food 'cause she would have Friday nights were family nights where she would had these theme meals, you know.  And act like she cooked them, you know, and they thought, oh that's absurd I was like, well, you know, absurdism can be real.

Speaker 1: So we were talking about 'Blue' [Charles Randolph-Wright] and I wanted to talk about the music in 'Blue' because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --it's just incredible. Tell me about Nona Hendryx and--
Speaker 2: Well, Nona Hendryx, first of all, before you even (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: In 'Blue,' I don't think 'Blue' would've--well it wouldn't have had the, the magnetism it had without [HistoryMaker] Phylicia Rashad.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, Phylicia Rashad was extraordinary.  I mean, when I gave it to her because I knew her obviously we were in 'Dreamgirls' together, you know, years ago.  And I first gave her the script, and she was so funny 'cause she read it and said, "I want to play the grandmother."  I was like, "No, not now," but she, she was extraordinary.  I mean it, it's just I, I mean I've adored her forever, but she truly is a goddess.  And people didn't recognize the actress she is until recently, you know, in 'Raisin in the Sun' ['A Raisin in the Sun,' Lorraine Hansberry] when she won the Tony [Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Theatre], and they acted as if that was the first time she had been doing theater.  She's been at the Alliance [Alliance Theatre, Atlanta, Georgia], she did 'Medea' [Euripides] at the Alliance.  I mean she's been doing theater ever since, you know, we did 'Dreamgirls' for twenty-five years.  She replaced Bernadette Peters in 'Into the Woods' on Broadway, which no one acknowledged.  I mean there are all these things, you know, I just keep thinking she is one of the top television moms.  And when we opened 'Blue' in New York [New York] the, The New York Times didn't even do a, you know, there wasn't even an article about her.  Then some of the other papers did, but I thought this is Phylicia Rashad give her, her due.  And it's so extraordinary with us because we don't get that acknowledgment that we see others get.  And I--my--I--'Blue' would not have been the same--I can't even imagine it.  And then Leslie Uggams ended up doing several productions of it.  So there've been several women who have been fantastic but making it happen it was her work and her faith in it and her belief in it and willing.  She was doing a show at the same time--willing to go out of town.  And, and doing it I mean, it's--I'm so indebted to her for what she gave the piece.  And how it, it really propelled me to make it the best it--I could make it.  And she's an amazing person, you know, she's an amazing actress, but the person that she is even, even surpasses that acting.  I can't, I can't say, you know, any th-, it's just I mean, she's amazing.  So the 'Blue' experience, you know, started really emanated from her being the center of that.

Speaker 1: And then what I wanted to do in the play was--I've always wanted to play with music being a character in, in a play not in a musical but in a play.  And so the idea of this was that 'Blue' [Charles Randolph-Wright] was this singer that we created, and the mother places his music.  And whenever she plays it, he appears on stage and sings it.  So it, it was my going back to my absurdism (laughter).  Going back to all these worlds colliding, my musical worlds, but the idea of this iconoclastic black singer.  And there is no one to create this but Nona Hendryx.  Nona and I have worked on projects for ten years, twelve years.  I mean she literally calls herself my sister.  She's my big sister, and we've done; we've done short films with done television projects.  We've done theater projects--every time I have a project in--on stage there's usually some incidental music.  She did classical music for this piece I did, 'Oak and Ivy' [Kathleen McGhee-Anderson] I mean every type of thing she can do.  I mean, there's nothing I can throw at Nona that she can't do.  And I mean and she's had an extraordinary career but also not acknowledged for the composer that she is.  You know, that she scores films that she's worked with some of the greatest people in rock.  She and Tina Turner I think are the only two women who've been nominated for rock Grammys [Grammy Award].  You know, that she wrote those LaBelle [Patti LaBelle] songs.  That she produces that kind of music that she has this whole wealth of material, it's not just R&B because again they put us in one category but Nona does alternative.  And she does--so everything I do, you know, Nona somehow I, I've forced her, and she laughs to do that.  We have a musical that we've written that we're doing next but she--'Preaching to the Choir' she scored--I made her be in it (laughter).  She had a cameo in it singing in it which is fantastic but she again as the goddess that Phylicia [HistoryMaker Phylicia Rashad] is in, in acting, Nona is in music.  I think there's no one with her scope that I know of--there's no one who could do absolutely everything in music and has the respect for that.  She is and, and again these people who, you know, you expect them to be diva's and they have none of that--none of that.  They're so clear and, and will do anything, will work at any time, will do, will sacrifice anything to do that work.  I've been so fortunate to have these extraordinary people around me like that.  And Nona is, is I can't say enough about her talent but also how she works and how she supports.  When you have someone like a Nona, especially in a piece like 'Blue,' you can't go wrong 'cause she gives you the support.  I mean, we created ten songs, all different styles 'cause they had to represent ten different albums.  And she did them I mean so quickly it's, it's amazing the work she can do.  And the, the things that we continue to do.

Speaker 1: If someone said that you were a Harlem Renaissance style playwright, what would you respond?
Speaker 2: Well, the first thing I would b-, say is thank you because the idea I always wanna be--my ultimate goal is to be a Renaissance man.  I love that description of a Renaissance man because that's the, the person who does some of everything.  And hopefully, does it well but that they do all this different things.  And I think I--when I think of the Harlem Renaissance I think of a time of ultimate creativity.  Of ultimate fertility of all types of, of work and no boundaries again having no limits.  And to me that's what the Harlem Renaissance means and so to be--to have a new Harlem Renaissance would be astonishing, and to be included in that would be a great thrill.  So to say that to me would be an ultimate honor and I hope--that's what I want to do.  And I also want to give others the opportunity to do that, and that's, that's something I've been able to do with the different things--the other work that I do that I'm able to open, open some doors.  I've been fortunate to get in some doors.  So I'm trying to, you know, that other people and I stand on the shoulders of who--of the people who knocked those doors open.  So, you know, I don't want to close them I wanna open those for others.
Speaker 1: Well, someone says that you are continuing in the tradition of Lorraine Hansberry and August Wilson.  (Laughter) What do you feel about that (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Those are, those are very, very difficult shoes (laughter) to fill (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, they opened doors (laughter) and--
Speaker 2: They opened doors, and I'm walking through those doors.  And I'm opening them, and I'm, I'm thrilled to have that to have people of said that, you know, because they're, you know, they were pioneers they changed our view.  And, and that's what we must keep doing we can't stay, you know, you can't be the same August Wilson, you know, you can't be the same I can't do just what August did, or I can't just do what Lorraine did or any of us.  We have to then take what they did and keep going that's what, that's what they did.  Should we stop?
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: Lorraine Hansberry and August Wilson changed the world of theater to, to be even remotely mentioned (laughter) in a paragraph or even pages near them would be is, is the ultimate honor.  And, and to be able to do work that, that will make people think, you know, that's entertaining but also didactic.  If I can do that--if I can change--you know, I've had people come up to me after productions and say, you know, that it changed me this made me go back to school, or that made me talk to my grandmother.  And talk to--I mean to do that as an artist.  As my mother [Ruth Lillian Lucas Wright Johnson] said to be able to heal and, and entertain there's nothing greater than that.  So to be in that world to be considered in that same world as these people I so respect and admire that's I, I can't ask for anything greater than that.
Story_ID: 373055
Speaker 1: When you think back over your life what stands out the most?  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: You know, the--when you said that the first image it's so interesting.  I di-, the first show I directed, big professional show was the twentieth anniversary of 'Hair' ['Hair: The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical'].  And it was at the UN [United Nations] it was a benefit.  It was the first time that the Reagans had put their name on an event for other than--an AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] event.  It was an AIDS benefit for children with AIDS.  And it was in--the first show to be in the United Nation's General Assembly.  And the guys who wrote 'Hair' originally came back, and they wrote new songs.  And all these people were in the show who were in it.  So Donna Summer opened the show singing 'Aquarius.'  Bea Arthur, I talked into singing 'Black Boys.'  Nell Carter sang 'White Boys,' Treat Williams, all these people were in the show there was supposed to be fifty by the time I finished I had 160 people in the show.  But these tickets were so expensive I thought, you know, they have to get their money's worth.  And it was in, in that theater, two things my mom [Ruth Lillian Lucas Wright Johnson] was sitting in the theater next to Yoko Ono, and, and she got to turn to her and said, "My son directed this."  And there was a, a Duke--there's a Duke who lives--Angier Duke lives in New York City [New York, New York].  And--one of the Duke, and I was an Angier B. Duke Scholarship [Angier B. Duke Memorial Scholarship] recipient (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: Never met him 'cause he's in New York.  I--several weeks after the event at the end of the night the actors pulled different people up from the audience up on the stage, and they were all dancing 'cause it was 'Hair' it was this love end.  And at the end of the night, all these people were dancing.  And a couple weeks later in one of these meetings afterward.  The producer said to me we were so thrilled they said Angier Duke has never, first of all, he doesn't even like going to events.  We don't think--but he was up on the stage dancing he had the time of his life this was so great.  And I was like Angier Duke as in Durham [North Carolina] Duke [Duke University], I mean the Dukes?"  And they said yes.  I said, "I was in Angier Duke's scholarship, this is how I went to school."  So I wrote him a letter and said and told him that I was the one that directed the show.  The show that he--you know, where he was up dancing.  And, and, you know, I heard back from him, and it was just so thrilling that I was able to say thank you.  That I was not only able to say thank you but that they saw it in action and that same show we were rehearsing, and there were--there was a gospel choir another one of my mentors and friends.  One of my dear friends is Edwin Hawkins, who's extraordinary, an extraordinary person who also I grab all of his music all the time he did 'Preaching to the Choir.'  I make him do everything with me you know.  And he's, he's a tremendous spirit, and he did 'Hair' he brought in a gospel choir.  And in that gosper choir were a couple of teenagers and we were rehearsing.  I was running around doing things 'cause I was we were at it was the first night in the UN, and we were rehearsing.  And I had a walkie-talkie on my hip and headsets and just running around doing various things, and I walked up to the choir, and I was talking to them.  I was like, "You guys okay? Is everything all right?"  And they were like, "Yes, this is great," and these kids because of Edwin's choir they had song in different, you know, they've been on television, they've done different performances, Carnegie Hall [New York, New York], different places.  And so they were pretty savvy about this kind of evening.  So the kid turns to me, and he said, "Excuse me, who's the director?" Because he thought I was a production assistant because that's what we are, you know, and I have a little hat.  But I said, "Oh I'm sorry I guess I didn't introduce myself to you. I am." And his face changed my life.  I, I think about that all the time because in that instant I know that he saw something he never thought he could be.  I know that in that instant he--it told him, you can do this, you can be this.  And that's as I was saying earlier in the interview about giving them images giving people in the inner-city images giving people anywhere images that, you know, this is someone who looks like you, you know.  We have to have people who look like us, so we realize, I can do this.  I can be this, and this kid, you know, I changed his life that night.  And I, I will never forget it, so when you said that, I think that's one of the moments where, where it stopped me because typically things like that you think about later, and you realize it.  And it stopped me on the spot and I couldn't, you know, I mean literally for ten minutes I couldn't move.  I was so overwhelmed and, and so proud that I was able to say that, "I am," it thrilled me.
Story_ID: 373056
Speaker 1: Well, talking about children, what message do you have for youth?
Speaker 2: The main message is that you can do and be anything that you want to be.  And you cannot allow the limitations of family, the limitations of society, the limitations of the community to stop you.  And, and if you do fail at something that's completely unimportant, you know.  The most important thing is that you tried it, and you keep trying because eventually you'll get it.  All the people who made a difference in life failed so many times, you know, they failed.  Lincoln [President Abraham Lincoln] failed an office ten times before he be, you know, before he was elected.  They talk about I guess Babe Ruth had the high, you know, had the highest batting record.  But he also had the highest strikeout record to, you know, you don't, you don't hear that all the different people who, who did certain things.  I mean, when you think of King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] you think of--I had the pleasure of, of hanging out with John Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson] at, at--what--at Ebony and with that whole family and being around years ago touring.  And he gave me a tour of Ebony.  I mean, I was doing this show in Chicago [Illinois], and I couldn't believe that, you know, he took time out to show me Ebony.  And, and what and how, how it was no one ever thought that, that magazine could be what it was.  And it was impossible for him to do what he did and he just said that he had this--he, he was blind enough and naive enough to keep going.  So I think being naive is imperative in certain situations that you have to go, you know, what every odd is against me, but I don't care.  Everyone's telling me I can't do this but you can, and it doesn't matter where you're from or who you are or what happened to you because amazing people didn't come from horrible families.  And harmful situations--sorry--amazing--amazing people can come from very difficult situations, you know.  And people who are very difficult can come from astonishing situations they can have every opportunity and it not happen.  And other people can get things who had zero opportunities who had very little things.  I think the main thing is what my mom [Ruth Lillian Lucas Wright Johnson] taught me and what, you know, her mother [Amelia Fagen Lucas] taught her.  And what our, our great-grandparents and our ancestors, when they learned to read.  When s-, when old man Witherspoon told them that they couldn't but, you know, Mrs. Wright said--Ms. Wright (laughter) Mrs. Witherspoon she was--Ms. Wright told them that they could, you know.  There's luckily there has been someone saying do this so maybe--I always say that I wanna change the world.  And if I don't change the world I want to affect the person that changes the world.  So if by telling them, hey, you can do this, you know.  I did it I wasn't supposed to, you know, I had the odds in my own way against me.  You know, we all do, you know, and whatever it is you have to pursue your dream.  And the pursuit is what is imperative, the pursuit is what is important.  And if you get the dream that's fantastic but that really is not what it's about.
Story_ID: 373057
Speaker 1: Tell me how do you want to be remembered?  What do you want people to say about you?
Speaker 2: I want them to say that I was kind that, that I cared about people.  That I cared about family, I cared about the world.  That I, that I wanted to make a difference and not a difference at the expense of someone else.  That I wanted to show the things that I knew that weren't seen.  That I wanted to give I wanted to give a window into--I want to give people a glimpse of something that they thought did not exist.  And if--I want them to say that, that I succeeded.  That, wow, I saw that.  That actually that they actually understood something or they were entertained by something.  Or they were enlightened by something.  And that as I did it I was able to do it in, in my way and my style which thanks to my family was taking (laughter) taking no prisoners.  Which thanks to my family was without compromise and, and life is compromise, you constantly compromise but you, you discover how you do it.  And I think ultimately the thing that I sa-, I told a friend--I told an interviewer one time is that I wanna sleep at night.  And if I do that means that I've--I'm doing all the things I believe in.
Story_ID: 373058
Speaker 1: You know, I talk about Brazil and on New Year's Eve in Brazil is a magical time in this country.  They--in the country because they all in, in the religion of candomble they worshiped this goddess of the water.  And at that on New Year's Eve is the time when they make their offering to this goddess Yemoja, it's the goddess of the ocean.  And fishermen literally jump in the ocean to get that blessing.  At midnight on New Year's Eve is when you go to the ocean to get that blessing, and it's, you know, it's an African tradition.  But it's a very Brazilian--everyone in Brazil does it everyone in the country wear's white and they go to the ocean.  And I went down for the millennium I thought, I'm at this point and in my--I can go anywhere I want to in the country I thought where do I want to.  So I went to Brazil with so- with one of my best friends [HistoryMaker Patti Carpenter], and so it's--I went to Rio [Rio de Janeiro, Brazil], to Copacabana Beach.  And on New Year's Eve 1999 there were 4 million people on the beach.  Everybody was in white as far as the eyes can see candles I mean it was, it was one of those extraordinary things I've ever seen.  And so we're on the beach and about a quarter 'til midnight and everybody's partying and crazy and fun but at a quarter to midnight all of a sudden it started getting quiet something that would never happen in Times Square [New York, New York] I mean on New Year's Eve right.  And people started meditating people started praying you can see that they were getting ready to ask for what they wanted in the New Year.  It's a really important thing that you ask the goddess Yemoja for what you want.  And you make that request at midnight, and so I'm standing there, I've got my white flowers to make my offering in the ocean.  And I'm thinking, what do I want, what I want to ask for, you know?  So it's, it's getting closer to midnight, and it's becoming amazing.  So finally, midnight strikes and I literally just walk out in the ocean 'cause we're sort of--everyone just sort of pushes everyone out in the ocean.  And I'm standing there, and I just started weeping I just started weeping, and I said, thank you, thank you.  I'm not going to ask for anything.  I said I'm going to say thank you because I'm doing everything (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --I ever wanted.  I'm so blessed I get to live the life I want.  And I said, and I need to be grateful, and so I'm not gonna ask for anything I'm just going to say thanks.
Story_ID: 373059
Speaker 1: You've done so much in your life, would you have done anything differently, I mean, do you have any regrets (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Wow.  The only regret I have I think I was--because I, I've been learning Portuguese (laughter).  And the only regret I had is that I didn't learn languages as a kid.  You know, we talked about languages, and I really hate that in this country we, we're, we're so arrogant that English is the only language.  You know, that we don't force us to, to learn.  I mean that, that's the only thing that I really regret that I didn't do that because it's so much easier than trying it learning now which is killing me you know.  But I--otherwise I did this I mean I, I jumped in, you know, I never there're times when I didn't.  Where if I didn't do something I believe in, if I didn't follow my instinct, I knew it was wrong and I got out of it, you know.  There were situations where I knew, oh, I should be there in this, and I would leave it.  But those are also educational, you know.  The times, you know, when you, when you first get fired (laughter) from something.  From a project, you know, and my mother [Ruth Lillian Lucas Wright Johnson] said, "Don't tell people you were fired."  I was like, "But I was," you know, when you're let go from something because of creative differences.  You know, I would not have changed that at all because of the strength it gave me to have my convictions.  I--regrets, it's so interesting I know it sounds ridiculous that I'm saying that language was a regret.  But that's, that's it I mean, I really have done, you know, I was told I could do what I'm doing, and I'm doing it.  And I think the important thing now when I talk about going to Brazil I go there because it makes me grateful.  When I'm there, I make in a week what some people make in a lifetime.  But down there, there's so they love their lives, you know.  I was standing on the beach one day and the sunset, and it was like the most gorgeous sunset I have ever seen in my life, and they started applauding.  People applauded on the beach, and I was like, yes, we should applaud, that's right we should do that.  It's like well what she [Alice Walker] says in 'The Color Purple,' God gets pissed if you see the color purple, and you don't know this, and that's true.  You know, we don't--we've become so--I don't want to get to the point where I'm so obsessed with the work, or the possessions or the thing where I don't stop and say thank you.  Where I'm not able to, to see that kid who sees something in me that I saw in somebody else and acknowledge it, you know.  I was so grateful that I realized it then that I didn't have to look back that I lived.  You know I really want to learn how more even more to live in the moment.  You know, to accept what I get to do with who I am, and, and celebrate it, and to celebrate it.
Story_ID: 373060
Speaker 1: Now before we go any further I want to ask is there anything that we did not talk about that you want to talk about (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  No, I think the thing I mentioned several of my teachers and I think I've, I've--you know, their names.  I've said it, but I think, you know, I'm, I'm the--my mom's [Ruth Lillian Lucas Wright Johnson] a teacher.  And teachers are so important whether there the teacher that are obviously teachers are the people who become teachers, and you don't realize it.  We, we have to, you know, I'm so concerned about our leaders, I'm so concerned that, that our children don't have people that they look up to.  I'm concerned that they don't have, you know, I grew up with idols, with people, with mentors with people I wanted to be.  And many of them I ended up meeting, you know, Leontyne Price was an idol of mine.  I ended up directing a show at Carnegie Hall [New York, New York] that she was in and, and her brother [George B. Price], you know, they became like family to me, and it turns out that her brother went to college [Colored Normal Industrial Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina; South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] with my mom [Ruth Lillian Lucas Wright Johnson], you know.  [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis I mentioned is someone I wrote this project ended up meeting her working with her. [HistoryMaker] Diahann Carroll, Sidney Poitier, all of these people that I grew up idolizing I've ended up working with them.  I've, I've they've seen my work or they worked with me. Diahann Carroll and [HistoryMaker] Phylicia Rashad were--played the grandmother and the daughter in, in 'Blue' [Charles Randolph-Wright] in Los Angeles [California].  And I told people it was like watching the Williams sisters [Venus Williams and Serena Williams] play tennis.  You know, it was--a-, those were those moments like that seeing Diahann Carroll and Phylicia Rashad on stage in my play.  I thought if, if I don't anything else look at this look at this.  When I--when 'Preaching to the Choir' opened, and we were back in Charlotte [North Carolina] and all these people from my hometown got to go and, you know, here's my movie in the theaters.  And they're seeing the commercials and it's in the papers.  You know, all those things I mean it's that I'm, I'm so thrilled because in a way I do get to say thank you with these things.  My--the people in my hometown have been so supportive of me.  When 'Dreamgirls' opened they had a bus that came up, and they came up to see it.  With 'Blue'--I had this benefit they did--they chartered buses for that.  They come to see everything I do there's always someone no matter where I am even when I've been in Europe they come up.  And they have some York [South Carolina] connection some hometown connection.  And I tell people who grew up in cities you don't understand what that's like.  See I can fake being from a big city I can fake being that urban man.  And I love living in New York [New York], this is my, my home.  You know, I lived in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], which I did not like I love Los Ange-, I mean I love living in New York City.  But there's something about coming from that hometown where they all--where everybody knows you.  Where they know your face, they know you, they knew your parents, they knew your grandparents.  You all have this--you have this bond and then they support you to have them support you this way is incredible.  I go home, and they just laugh they said I make news just to--that, you know, I'm coming home for Thanksgiving it's in the paper, you know.  I--but there, they're proud me and I'm proud of them and I, I'm so happy to have had that background and then to be able to give back.  And that's why I'm starting this arts festival [Create Carolina] at home.  That's why I'm starting this foundation [Wright Family Foundation] back in my hometown these things so that I can give back.  And I can perhaps have that door squeak open a little bit, you know, for some of these next people that want to come through because it's, it's difficult.  It's difficult it's, it's--I even feel--I was so naive I thought--oh--I was naive I thought that, you know in the '60s [1960s] I really thought things would change, I did, you know.  And what's was so depressing now--things have changed in, in major ways, some things, but many things haven't.  You know, and a lot of the battles we're still fighting and, and I thought they would be easier, and they are not, you know.  I'm more equipped I won't give up, I'm willing to fight, but I didn't think I would have to, and that surprises me and depresses me, but it doesn't stop me.  And it makes me angry, but it doesn't make me bitter.
