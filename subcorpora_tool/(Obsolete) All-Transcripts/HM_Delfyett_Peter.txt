Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm the interviewer today with the HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Sure.  My name is Peter John Delfyett, and I'm a junior.  Delfyett is 'D' like David, E-L-'F' like Frank, Y-E-T-T.
Speaker 1: Okay, Junior.  And is there a story behind the name Delfyett?
Speaker 2: Yes, as far as we know.  And for sure, we do know that name originated from my ancestors which came over from the island of what's now referred to as Haiti, in the Dominican Republic.  So, somewhere around in the early 1800's, the first Delfyett came over.  I think his name was John Delfyett.  And we were able to find the death record of his son, who was also a John Delfyett.  And on that death record, it asked who his parents were.  And it identified his father as a John Delfyett, which originated from the island of Hispaniola.  And its port of departure was Saint Dominguez, which today is referred to as the Dominican Republic.  And so, at that time of the early 1800s, I think the French or the Haitians were in control of the island.  After that, the Spanish got in control of the eastern end of the island, and it became the Dominican Republic.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  And sir, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Sure.  March 8th, 1959, and I was born in Queens, New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And sir, what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: Sure.  I am a professor here at the College of Optics and Photonics at the University of Central Florida [Orlando, Florida].  I work in a research center called CREOL.  And it's rather interesting that I have some sort of French background, and the place is called CREOL [Center for Research and Education in Optics and Lasers] (laughter).  But CREOL is an acronym for Center for Research and Education in Optics and Lasers.  And I hold the title of University Trustee Chair Professor of Optics, Electrical Engineering, and Physics.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you come with name CREOL, or did someone else?
Speaker 2: Someone else came up with that name.
Speaker 1: So, that is interesting.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that is.  As a matter of fact, the first director of CREOL is in fact from Louisiana.  So, there is also some interesting stories regarding that also.  His name is M. J. Swallow.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Alright.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is June 4, 2013.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: And we're currently on the third floor of the CREOL Building right here on the lovely campus, campus at University of Central Florida.

Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --there are five lightweight questions that we always ask as kind of a warm-up.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: They only require or deserve a short answer.  The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I do.  And I tend to like Asian food the best.  I tend to like spicy food.  So, I think the kind of Szechuan Chinese food is pretty good, you know.  Thai food is pretty good.  But that tends to be sort of like my number one favorite food.  After that, I tend to like stuff which is sort of garlicky, kind of like Italian food, and sort of--sometimes New York pizza is pretty good, too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My favorite color is blue, no doubt about it.  And I remember specifically the day I chose blue as my favorite color.  I was probably maybe four or five years old.  And I grew up in an extended family kind of arrangement.  And so my uncle, my dad's brother, said, "Peter John, what's your favorite color?"  So, I said, "Am I supposed to have a favorite color?"  He said, "Sure, everyone has a favorite color."  And so, I had no idea on how to pick a favorite color.  But I remember the sort of--and this was in the summertime--that these, you know icicles that the ice cream man would sell in the truck.  And there was my favorite one, which was sort of, you know, grapish flavor or some kind of bubble gum flavor.  And it was blue.  And I was like, "Yeah, that's the color, and I like that flavor.  So, apparently that must be my favorite color."  And I must have been about four or five years old at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Favorite time of the year?  That's a harder question, because there are certain times of the seasons which can be very heartwarming and nostalgic.  Down here in Florida we don't get so much of a change of seasons.  But when I was a kid I really loved Christmastime, obviously, because as a kid you--well, you can think about all the gifts and presents you're going to get.  Also, as a kid you typically like summer, because school is out and it means it's playtime.  And so, to some degree that might be one reason why I'm perhaps down there in Florida, because it's like summer all the time, and it's light out all the time, and it just gives me a good feeling.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I love going to the Caribbean.  I like being, seeing the blue water.  I like the beaches, I like that tropical feeling.  So, I've been to, you know, many islands all throughout the Caribbean.  And if I had a choice, you know, that's a good place to go.  One day, hopefully, I'll get to go visit the South Pacific, because I think it probably looks pretty nice over there, too.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  The last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: There are probably several.  It depends upon if I'm trying to, you know, to motivate people.  But one expression that I think people that I've come up with in the past to try and motivate people is that, "As you're walking across the path of life, and you come to an incline, you have to step up if you want to move forward."
Story_ID: 27150
Speaker 1: Now, I'm going to ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family separately from your father's side.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Then we'll ask about his, and then we'll try to bring them together.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So I want, you know, to try to get their history to when they were adolescents at least, you know.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: So, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Sure.  My mother's full name is Barbara Scianna, S-C-I-A-N-N-A.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what kind of name is that?
Speaker 2: That's Italian.  Her parents, or grandparents, came from Sicily.  And I think they moved from Sicily over to Tunisia in the early 1900's, around 1905.  I think it was a large exodus of Sicilians to North Africa at that time.  I think the mainland of Italian was sort of coming into Sicily trying to invade and sort of take over and rule the place.  And there was a lot of fighting going on, and I think Sicilians felt it was safer for them to leave.  And so, I think there were 11 million Sicilians left the island in the early 1900s.  It's one of the largest exoduses of people other than the Jewish migration, I believe.
Speaker 1: Yes, I think the Italians occupied Libya, I think it was one of the--
Speaker 2: Also, right, yeah.  The colonies were all in North Africa, right.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay.  So, and what is your mother's date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I believe she was born in 1940.  And I believe that's also in the New York City area [New York].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, what can you tell us about your mother's ancestors, and how far back can you trace them, and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: Sure.  Okay, I don't know a lot about my mother's history.  But I will tell you what I do know.  As I mentioned, I guess it would be my great-grandparents on my mother's father's side, if you will.  They left Sicily in the early 1900's, moved to Tunisia, and had a vineyard.  And they were there for just a few years.  And then from Tunisia, they moved to Poughkeepsie, New York.  Again, I don't know when that was--but again, early 1900s, maybe 1910, 1911, 1915.  I'm not sure.  I also know somewhere in my background--my mother told me--I recently found out that somewhere in my lineage on my mother's side, that one of the family members was a baron, you know, and had a castle.  I'm not sure who that was or where that is, but that's what I found out.  And I'm trying to find out the details of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, this baron would have been in Italy?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that would have been probably in the main part of Italy, because I think my grandmother, my mother's mother, her lineage was from sort of the main part of Italy, whereas my mother's father and his lineage was from Sicily.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, alright.  So, your mother, she was born in New York, after the family came over?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.  I don't know if it was New York City.  It could have been, you know, in Poughkeepsie.  But basically, yeah, for sure the New York area.
Speaker 1: Did your mother share any stories about growing up, with you?
Speaker 2: How about this?  My parents had separated when I was probably still in diapers.  And so, I did not really know much about my mother and that part of my family for quite a period of time.  I was able to sort of reconnect with my mother when I was about eighteen years old, and had been, you know, gathering bits and pieces of information regarding the family history since then.  And this piece about there being a baron in the family, was a piece of information I just gathered this last-this last Christmas.
Story_ID: 27151
Speaker 1: So, I take it you were raised by your, your father?
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly.  We were raised by my father, you know, in the house of my grandparents, my father's parents, in an extended family situation.  It was my grandparents, my dad, and his two brothers.  And of course, myself and my two sisters.  So, the eight of us lived inside of a home right there in Bayside, Queens [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let me go to your father's side.  Then we'll bring your mother back in.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: So, can you give us your father's full name, and spell it?
Speaker 2: Sure.  My father is--
Speaker 1: It's the same as--
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly--Peter John Delfyett, exactly.
Speaker 1: Same as yours, except he's senior.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what is date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born June 16, 1938.  And he was also born in Queens, probably in Flushing Hospital.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now, what can you tell us about the ancestors on your father's side?  You told us some already.
Speaker 2: Sure, absolutely.  We, the Delfyetts, have been in Bayside Queens for generations.  My father grew up on 46th Avenue.  And there were two different houses, one around the corner from each other.  Before he was born, my grandfather, who was born and raised in Bayside, grew up on 38th Avenue, just a few blocks away.  He was born in 1898.  His father--so, my grandfather was William, or Willie, Delfyett.  His father was a William Delfyett.  I'm not sure of his birth date or death date, but I could find that for you.  And then there is the--my grandfather's grandfather, who was a John Delfyett.  And he was the one that was born in 1844.  And so all of them, effectively, lived in Queens, New York.  And all of them are buried in Flushing Cemetery, the entire family.  So, you can go down to Flushing Cemetery and find the oldest Delfyett, and just kind of trace out the family tree accordingly.
Speaker 1: Now, what kind of things did they do for a living?
Speaker 2: Sure.  My dad started out as a, as the tillerman in the New York City Fire Department.  The tillerman is the guy that rides the back of the hook and ladder.  That's the big long truck.  And so, my father progressed through the ranks and ultimately retired in 1993 as Battalion Chief in the New York City Fire Department.  My grandfather worked for a chemical company, Powers, Powers Chemco.  And they--to my best, best of my recollection, they made the chemicals, or emulsion, that were used on photographic film.  And I believe before that, my grandfather worked at the Chiclets Gum factory in Long Island City, in Queens.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Chiclets were really popular at one time.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Seems like a lot of other gums have kind of (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, have come--yeah, yeah.  But back in the day, Chiclets were probably it.
Speaker 1: That was, yeah, that was the gum.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So again, this is a long, long, long, long time ago, you know.  Probably--you know, and I'm talking maybe 1930s or 1940s, when he was working in the Chiclets factory, yeah.
Story_ID: 27152
Speaker 1: Now, your father [Peter John Delfyett Sr.], he was able to finish high school?  Was he able to go to college?
Speaker 2: So, my father finished high school.  He graduated from Bayside High School [New York, New York].  But then, you know, in short order, you know, sort of found...  So, he was then going to Hunter College [New York, New York] and had a diving accident.  He was working out in the pool and had a slight diving accident, and he hit his head on the springboard.  But ultimately, he also at the same time was having a family.  And so, in short order, you know, he had three children--my two sisters and myself.  And ultimately, you know, left college to take care of his family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is this with your mother [Barbara Scianna]?
Speaker 2: And so, that was, you know, with my mother.  But then my mother and father didn't stay together very long.  So, by the time I guess I was maybe two or so...
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: I believe they met when they were both in high school.
Speaker 1: so, they met at Bayside?
Speaker 2: Bayside High School, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And he was just a couple years older than...
Speaker 2: Yeah, about two years older.
Speaker 1: Now, in those days, would they be considered a mixed couple?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, was there a lot of pressure on them, you think, in retrospect, to--
Speaker 2: And so--and so, I'm sure that had some influence in terms of which parent was going to raise us, when they were splitting up.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  Because they would have been--considering the status of African Americans in Queens and the status of Italians in Queens, it would have been--having black children would have brought your mother lower status.  Is that true?
Speaker 2: Certainly my natural mother was young, as my father was.  And, you know, had she taken us, she would have wanted to go back to live with her parents, just to be able to help.  And I believe she had a stepfather at the time that was probably not too keen on the idea of her returning home with three children with mixed ethnic origins.
Speaker 1: So, this is not a matter of status so much as it could be a matter of life and death in that situation?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Or, a matter of--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --you know, a lot of rancor and--
Speaker 2: Right.  I think, you know, it was something along the lines of--well, you know, if my mother could take us, sure, but she would then not be accepted to come home.  And so it was clear that, you know, for the best outcome for the kids, it would be much better off for us to go with my father.
Story_ID: 27153
Speaker 1: So, you all were raised in the extended family of your father [Peter John Delfyett Sr.]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --with your grandmother and grandfather there?
Speaker 2: Right.  My dad and his two brothers, my two uncles, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was just an absolute fantastic, fantastic experience, just a fantastic experience.  It's unfortunate that some of us don't get a chance to grow up in that kind of environment.  But those are some of the best childhood memories that I'll ever have, because I didn't have a brother of my own, but my two uncles were like surrogate brothers, even though they were substantially older than me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Like two older brothers, I guess?
Speaker 2: They were like two older brothers, exactly, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you had two uncles, your father was there, and your grandmother and grandfather, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, when you think about, I guess, who influenced you the most, or who you take after the most, of all of these figures who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: That's, that's a hard question, simply because each one has had such an influence on me, you know, whether it's my grandfather or my dad or his two brothers.  Because there are certain lessons of life that I have learned through each of them that stay with me today, that basically make up who I am as a person.  There's no question about it.  And so, to say which one am I most like?  You know, we all had sort of individual personalities.  And I know there are some ways I'm really, really like my dad.  But then on the other hand, I know there have been life lessons that I've learned from my uncles and my grandfather that sort of, you know, become a part of who I am when I'm out, either working with people or just in terms of who I am as an individual.
Story_ID: 27154
Speaker 1: Just considering this, it seems like a unique situation--I mean it's an opportunity for intergenerational transmission, you know, where you have your grandparents there and you've got the next generation of your brother and his--I mean your father and his brothers.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then--
Speaker 2: And then me and my sisters, yeah.  It's, it was such a wonderful experience because, you know, my grandfather sort of taught me how you could sort of create something out of nothing.  For example, you know, if it's--you know, I'd be looking around to play with something, and he'd say, "Peter John, what's the matter?"  And I'd say "I want to play with something, but I don't want to play with my toys."  He says, "Oh, come here.  Let's make, let's build some toys."  "Oh, oh, sounds okay.  I'm ready for this."  So he'd go, "Grandma, do you have an old coat button?"  And so, she'd go into the drawer and pull out an old coat button.  "Do you have some string?"  "Sure."  She'd get some string.  And he makes a loop with the string, but puts it through two of the holes on the button.  So, it's like the button is here, and the string is a loop that goes through one hole and it would go through the other hole.  And so, then you take this thing and you sort of wrap it around and spin it.  And this thing sort of winds up like a spring, and you start to pull this thing in and out.  And oh, man, I was just fascinated with this!  That's one.  Number two:  "Oh, gee.  Grandma, do you have a handkerchief?"  "Sure."  She's got a handkerchief.  "Grandma, do you have a clothespin?"  This is one of these wooden clips that you hang the clothes on, on the outside, because, just before we had dryers.  Then he'd get some string and he'd take the four corners of the handkerchief, put string on it, and have them all come to--and tie it around the clothespin.  So, this was sort of like the man, and this was sort of like his parachute.  And so, we'd fold this stuff up and throw it out the second floor window and watch the thing open up and fall to the ground.  That's toy number two.  Two number three:  And this is sort of, I saw this thing on this movie 'Crocodile Dundee.'  But here's what it was.  And my grandfather made--you know, he would go down to the basement and get one of these wooden sticks that you used to stir the paint, one of these things.  And it had a little hole in it.  And so, you took the stick and you'd put strings through the hole, you know, long.  And you'd sort of then start to swing this thing around.  And the wooden stick would start to sort of rotate.  And as it would swing around it would brrrr, brrrr, brrrr.  My grandfather taught me how to make stuff out of nothing.  That's one interesting experience.  And I can through experiences with my uncles.  One of my uncles, he was the one who taught me how to tie my shoes.  He taught me how to throw a football, and all of that stuff.  My other uncle would take me out, you know, running track.  I became a runner at some point.  And his philosophy was--you know, I tell students--you know, my uncle would take me running, and we'd be running through the hills of Alley Pond Park.  And I'd say, "Uncle Bill, I'm getting tired."  So, he says, "When the tough gets going, the going gets--no, excuse me, "When the going gets tough, the tough get going."  I said okay, let me step it up a little bit.  And I go a little bit more.  And I'd say, "Uncle Bill, I'm getting tired."  And so he'd repeat, you know, "When the going gets tough, the tough get going."  And so, finally I'm like, "Uncle Bill, I'm really tired, I can't go..."  He says, "If it's too hot in the kitchen, get out."  And I'm like, "Oh, he's going to leave me out here." (laughter).  And so, that taught me to persevere, never give up, no matter how tired you are.  So, these are little things that I've learned by living in this sort of extended family, you know, outlook environment.  My dad always taught me to be conscientious, to be responsible--to take care of what you need to take care of.  That's the lesson that he's taught me that he probably doesn't know that he has taught me.  You know, because my dad gave up a lot to raise his kids.  My dad was very, very smart in math and physics and science, and did not have an opportunity to really explore that.  And basically gave that up, you know, to be able to raise his family.  And so, he taught me that no matter happens, you have to stand up and take care of your responsibilities, whatever that is.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And I've got, I've got many stories, but I'll stop there.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But those are good stories, those are good stories.
Story_ID: 27155
Speaker 1: Though your parents split up, it seems as though you had a very strong secure family, right?
Speaker 2: We had a very, very strong family unit.  My dad's oldest brother was able to finish college, and became an educator.  So he taught at, he went to Queens College [New York, New York].  And he ultimately got his doctorate in education from the Teacher's College of Columbia [University, New York, New York].  My other uncle was a member of the New York City Police Department.  And when my sisters and I were young, you know, we were told we would be going to college.  No if, ands or buts about it.  We were going to be going to college.  And so, we just had that mindset, that that was expected from us.  Not just from my father and my uncles, but my grandparents--everyone.  Our family said this is what you're going to do.  And so, that just became a natural course for us.   We were just expected to do that.
Speaker 1: Now, did the Delfyetts, were they pretty well politically connected?  And the reason why I ask is because the family has been there a long time, and also because of the presence of a fireman and a police officer, you know.
Speaker 2: I wouldn't, I wouldn't necessarily say politically connected.  But perhaps, the Delfyetts were in that part of Queens [New York, New York] when there was nothing there, when there was just farmland.  I mean, just nothing.  Again, and we're going to go back to the mid-1800s or so.  There was nothing there.  And so, the family, the Delfyetts--and some of the Delfyetts--there's another family called the Taylors--were sort of combined there.  And these families have been in that part of Queens, you know, for generations.  And probably because we were there before anybody else, you know, it's not like folks were going to push us out, I guess.  It was just sort of our home, you know.  And that was a time when people sort of were born in the house, grew up, and potentially either died in the same house or grew up in the house around the corner.  And that was sort of like what my grandfather did.  He was born on 38th Avenue and died on 46th Avenue, just, you know, ten blocks away, less than ten blocks away.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think the fact that we grew up in New York City, which is maybe a more liberal city, I guess, since it's in the Northeast...  At the time that my father and uncles were coming of age--this is now, you know, very, very, very early sixties.  You know, you could in fact aspire to become a member of the police department or fire department, or whatever it is.  Civil service was in fact a viable path for a profession.
Story_ID: 27156
Speaker 1: Well, can you name your uncles for us?  We didn't name them.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: They're important people.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  The oldest brother, his name is William Delfyett.  My grandfather is Willie, and so the first son was William.  He doesn't have a middle name.  And then the youngest brother is Michael, whose middle name is Sinclair.  And Sinclair is the maiden name of my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Michael Sinclair Delfyett.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And William Delfyett.
Speaker 1: Alright.  And is William the educator?
Speaker 2: Yes, correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And Michael's a police officer?
Speaker 2: Yes.  He was a police, police officer for twenty years, and then after that he retired and joined the postal service for another fifteen years.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And your sisters--now you have two sisters.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Younger than you?
Speaker 2: No, they're both older than me.
Speaker 1: They're older, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I'm the youngest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm the youngest.
Speaker 1: So, can you name them in the order that they--
Speaker 2: Sure, absolutely.  The first one is Donna, Donna Marie.  And the second one is Barbara, Barbara Ann.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, do you have an earliest childhood memory, the first thing you remember?
Speaker 2: Wow.  The--how about this?  I tell people I actually remember being in diapers.  I really do remember being in diapers.  I remember my grandmother changing my diapers.  And if you want to ask me about the earliest childhood memories, I do remember this.  When I was a baby, I think I had got an intestinal virus.  And I was sent back to the hospital and I wound up being in an incubator, I think, for like a month.  And they were feeding me through my wrists and through my ankles.  And I remember being a baby, but being back at home, and wanting to touch the band aids on my ankles, and my grandmother saying, you know, "Don't do that, don't do that."  But I was pretty young.  And you know, again, I can't, I can't put my finger on it, but if you say what's sort of the earliest possible memory, I do remember that, and that's--that's going back a little bit.  (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's way back.
Speaker 2: (laughter).  That's way back.  And then, again, I remember my grandmother changing my diapers, and people just saying, you know, "How do you do that?"  I mean, I just, I just do, I just somehow remember it.  I have a very good photographic memory.  I have lots of memories--memories when I'm in a crib, easily, you know, with the sides that go up and down.  Oh yeah, sure. Sure, sure, sure. My uncle would play--we'd play musical albums by Olatunji, who's an African drummer.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: And oh, man, you know, the drumming would actually make me very nervous.  I would start to cry because I think it was--I don't know what it was, but I was sort of--you're sort of afraid.  But, you know, I'm a little baby.  And interestingly enough, what do I do now as one of my hobbies?  I'm a drummer. (laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you play the congas?
Speaker 2: I play, I play the full set.  I play the full set, but I don't play congas.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: I can play a little, but not as good as real congueros.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: Was your uncle a conguero?
Speaker 2: No, no, he wasn't.  But I think he was--he was very eclectic in his choice and taste in music--Miriam Makeba, Olatunji--you know, things of this nature, right.  And so, so I was exposed to, you know, that style of music, you know, being super tiny.  And then my other uncle, Mike, he was much more into sort of doo wop, you know--Delfonics,   and stuff like that, you know, back in the late fifties, early sixties.  And so I sort of grew up, you know, at the age of four, five and six--you know, listening to all of Motown, things of that nature, right.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (laughter).  It's very good, it's great.  So, because the interesting thing is that when there are people which are, you know, much older than me.  And when they start talking about music from their era, they're pretty surprised that I know as much, if not more, than they do about that.  Because I was listening to that kind of music when I'm, you know, four or five years old, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's something.  Now, your uncle listening to Miriam Makeba and Olatunji, that's really--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, he was the eclectic uncle?
Speaker 2: Yeah.

Speaker 1: What was the name of your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: The first neighborhood I grew up in, that was in Bayside--Bayside, Queens.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's where I grew up.  And then when I was nine years old, my father remarried and we moved to Springfield Gardens, which is sort of southeast Queens, whereas Bayside is sort of northeast Queens.  That's just on the Queens side of the Throgs Neck Bridge, very much close to the Queens, Nassau borderline.  When my father remarried, we moved to the south side of Queens to Springfield Gardens which, again, is near the Queens, Nassau County borderline, but just further south.  It's about maybe five or six miles away from Bayside.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, Queens is a unique borough in New York [New York], in that it has actual yards and trees and--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: General--I mean, generally, it's--
Speaker 2: It's more of a, it's certainly not like growing up in Manhattan or Brooklyn [New York, New York], which is more brownstone type flavors.  Certainly there are areas in Brooklyn which have houses and yards.  But many times when people think of Brooklyn, the real, you know, booming era of Brooklyn--and even uptown in Harlem [New York, New York], is the brownstone.  Brownstones were basically the houses that most folks sort of grew up in back many, many years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: But Queens is more residential, if you want to call it that.
Speaker 1: So, did you all have a house?
Speaker 2: And so, yeah, in Bayside we had a house.  In both places, we had a house and a yard.  Yes, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, okay, so what were some of the--and think about the entire, you know, number of years of growing up, the entire spectrum.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells that you remember, growing up?
Speaker 2: Right.  I certainly--some of the sounds that I remember are the sounds of the Mr. Softy ice cream truck.  It's summertime, you know.  The Good Humor truck, Bongo Bars, those were sort of the three main ice cream trucks.  You know, Mr. Softy, Good Humor and Bongo Bar.  So, you just sort of either hear the jingle of this ice cream truck, or the bells that they would ring.  Other interesting sights--you know, again, as a kid, going to the New York City World's Fair, as an example.  That was a--
Speaker 1: So, you were young then.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was young.
Speaker 1: You were about five?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's correct.  The World's Fair was '64 [1964] and '65 [1965].  Yeah, that's correct.  I was born in 1959.  So, five and six, I remember that clearly.  And I was enthralled with seeing dinosaurs, you know.  By the time I was in first grade or second grade, I wanted to be paleontologist, you know.  The smells--you know, you distinctly remember the smell of the Christmas tree at Christmastime.  You distinctly remember the smell of sort of like the small family reunions and the barbecues you had in the summertime.  Those are the really distinctive, you know, smells you have, that I certainly remember.  And I also remember the smell of Johnson's baby powder.  (laughter).  You know, that, for some reason that's something, because that was what my grandmother put on me a lot.  So, that was very nice. (laughter).
Story_ID: 27158
Speaker 1: Was, was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: And so, yeah.  When I lived in Bayside [Queens, New York, New York], we went to All Saints Episcopal Church, which had been there forever.  And that was sort of the church of the Delfyett family, you know, for generations.  The Delfyetts got married there.  And there was a funeral home down the block, Lloyd's Funeral Home.  And, you know, we'd have funeral services at Lloyd's Funeral Parlor.  And growing up, I became a part of the choir, the junior choir, I believe that was.  And I probably did that for just a few years, maybe a year or two.  And then at that point, I was probably nine years old, and my dad was remarrying.  And then we moved over to Springfield Gardens.  And then we went to Saint Albans the Martyr Church, which was also an Episcopal church.  And there, my sisters and I got confirmed and I became an acolyte, or altar boy.  And I did that probably until I was maybe fifteen or so--fifteen or sixteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did--what role did that play on your--in your life in terms of--
Speaker 2: Well, I think what it certainly did, it reinforced some of the teachings and morals that your family were teaching you, in terms of, you know, being the best person you could be, you know.  Treat others the way you would like to be treated.  And so, these are things that you'd be learning at home from your, your dad, his uncles, your grandparents.  But then you go out into the real world, so to speak, and you hear the same sort of teachings, and you sort of see that.  And you see people from different backgrounds, etc. coming together at church, you know, trying to exercise these teachings and morals. So, I think having that experience was very good in terms of strengthening those lessons that we got at home.
Speaker 1: Now, did the church--in the Episcopal Church, I'm thinking a place like Queens would probably have a number of different African American ethnic groups and African groups--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --probably, I'm thinking.
Speaker 2: Right, that's correct.
Speaker 1: From Jamaica, Barbados--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and Africa and so forth.
Speaker 2: Now that was, that was more observable when we went to Saint Albans the Martyr Church in Springfield Gardens.  When we went to All Saints Church in Bayside, there were basically sort of two African American communities.  One, which was sort of near the church--they were just sort of separated by several blocks.  And we just wanted to go to All Saints just because that was the church that our family went to for generations.  And most of the, you know, African Americans there were relatives.  Either you know, cousins of cousins--you know, third cousins, etc.  But yeah, these were, you know, there'd be cousins of my grandfather.  So, how many cousins removed from me?  It's quite a number.
Speaker 1: But at Saint Albans there'd be more...
Speaker 2: But at Saint Albans--because Springfield Gardens, that was very close to Cambria Heights, Laurelton, Hollis, Queens, And so, that whole--that was a much more predominant African American community, much more so than Bayside.  And as a result, you had, you know, people of color from all sorts of walks of life, whether they're, you know, African Americans moving up from the South, or coming from the Caribbean or from Africa themselves-- from itself, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 27159
Speaker 1: Now, where did you start school?
Speaker 2: I started school in kindergarten in P.S. 31 [Public School 31], Queens [New York, New York].  That was in Bayside.  And my dad went to that school, and I would say that my grandfather went to that school.  But when my grandfather went to elementary school, there wasn't a New York City Public School system.  But there was a schoolhouse on that corner, and that was the schoolhouse my grandfather went to.  So, he went to school before there was the New York City Public School system.  And in that house--they knocked down that schoolhouse, built a school and, you know, it became P.S. 31.
Speaker 1: Okay, P.S. 31.
Speaker 2: P.S. 31.
Speaker 1: Did it have any other name, other than--
Speaker 2: And so, to my knowledge, no.  P.S. is for 'public school', 31 is the number, and they end it with 'Q' for Queens.  That was sort of the numbering system in the New York City Board of Ed [Education].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did you go there throughout elementary school?
Speaker 2: And so, I went there through fourth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was in 1968.  That was when my father remarried and we moved to Springfield Gardens.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you like school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I thought school was great.  Because we, you know, it was expected that we did well in school.  School was not a place to go and mess around.  School was the place to go to learn.  And so, you know, it was not good to come home with poor grades.  So, it was expected that we were to go to school and do well.  And I just somehow sort of liked school.  I really liked school.  And I tell my young nephews--and my grandmother would tell my young nephews that when I would come home from school, before I would do anything, I'd rush in, I'd open my books right on the couch.  And without even taking my jacket off--and I would just start doing my homework.  But again, the reason was, was that I was not allowed to go outside and play until my homework was done.  And when you live in the Northeast during the school year--you know, you're talking October through March, whatever it is--the sun sort of sets a little on the early side.  And so, I'd have to come in when the street lights come on, which was about sort of 4:30.  So I'm getting home at 3:00.  So, if I want to make sure I can go out and play, I gotta have my homework done.  I'd better get it done quickly.  (laughter).  So, there's no time to mess around.  So, I liked school, and I liked doing math and I liked science.  I didn't know that I liked science.  But apparently, I started getting my report cards and seeing that I was getting 'Excellents' in science.  And it occurred to me, I said, "Oh, gee, apparently I must be good in science.  Or, my science teacher likes me."  That's how I interpreted it, my science teacher likes me.
Story_ID: 27160
Speaker 1: So, you didn't realize you had an interest in science.  I mean, you wanted to be a paleontologist--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --at a certain point, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  And so, how that happened--my dad took me, we had gone to the doctor's in the morning for an eye exam.  And we came home, and he said let's, you know, "Pete, let's go to the movies."  "Great, what are we going to see?"  "Here's a good movie.  It's called 'Journey to the Beginning of Time.'"   Not 'Journey to the Center of the Earth,' but 'Journey to the Beginning of Time.'  And this was--and the movie was about, I think, four kids who wind up going to the New York City Museum of Natural History and seeing all the dinosaurs, and all of this.  And then they come out of the museum and they go over into Central Park, and they get on one of those rowboats.  And they go through, you know, underneath one of the tunnels of the roads.  And when they come out, they're back in prehistoric times, and they're in with the dinosaurs.  And I was just fascinated by this.  Because, you know, I lived in New York City, I knew the Museum of Natural History.   And seeing these scenes of dinosaurs was really, really, you know, interesting, because these things went back millions and millions of years.  And what was rather interesting is that, you know, this sort of created a little bit of conflict, in terms of the things that you would be taught in church.  You know, Adam and Eve, and there were two people.  "Well, gee, if they only have two sons--how does, where does the rest of the world come from?  We know there must be women involved."  So, I was very keen on asking these questions, and I wanted answers.  I demanded answers (laughter).  And so, that's always a little challenging when you're, you know, six and seven years old demanding answers to these questions.  But having seen that movie, you know, I was just fascinated.  And I came home and I went to the encyclopedia, and I started looking up dinosaurs.  I wanted to learn the names, I wanted to learn how to spell them.  You know, when did they exist, what did they eat, what did they look like?  I would start to draw them.  I was just totally captivated, because this was something that, that was out there in the historical record of the earth, but was really sort of not being taught to me, either in school or in church.  And so, it was a whole new thing for me.  And then my grandfather would sit me down on his lap.  And occasionally he would find articles in 'The New York Times' in the science section, about science and nature and dinosaurs, whatever.  And he'd say, "Peter John, I've got something for you to read."  And mind you, I'm like in kindergarten or first grade.  And he'd sit me down on his lap and we'd literally read the articles.  And he'd have me read it word by word.  And I'd get to the challenging word, he'd say, "Come on, let's sound it out."  He'd cover the letters up and took the syllables.  "What does this look like?"  "What does this look like?"  "Okay, let's put it together."  So, by the time I'm in first, second grade, I'm reading--I don't want to say I'm reading science articles out of 'The New York Times,' but I was reading it, maybe not necessarily understanding it.  But this was the kind of experience that I was having that started me, and again, I didn't know it, but what started me down the path of becoming really interested in science.
Speaker 1: Okay, that sounds like a great experience.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, it was great.
Speaker 1: How did adults deal with your questions?  I take it they did--they tried to answer them on some level, right?
Speaker 2: Sure.  Hard to remember what they answered, but I do sort of remember that, "I'm not satisfied with that answer."  (laughter).  " That's just, that's just not satisfying me at all."  So, I knew that they would try to answer them at some level, but I just sort of wasn't buying it.  (laughter).  I guess it's probably the best way you could say it.
Speaker 1: So, did you kind of, like separate in your mind, like science from religion, or--
Speaker 2: And so, and so, what I became sort of more cognizant of was that, you know, religion becomes an excellent place by which to teach or to share knowledge on learnings or experiences that people have, in terms of how we should really try to be towards each other.  Because if you really take a look at all religions, the main tenets are basically the same.  What I was more frustrated with was when people would try to interpret or extract hard core--like scientific fact--from the Bible, when you could sort of look at the scientific record and see that there is a disconnect.  You'd say, okay, you know, for example, the story of Noah's Ark.  Oh, two by two and all the animals, and they even name them.  And I'm like, "Well, what about the dinosaurs?"  Because I want to, I'm very interested in dinosaurs.  "Clearly, we know there were dinosaurs.  I can go and see the skeletons of the dinosaurs.  I don't see brontosaurs and stegosaurs, I don't see that in Noah's Ark.  You know, they were much bigger than Noah's Ark, you know, in the first place."  So, there was, that's why there was a little bit of a disconnect.  And so that's why I sort of didn't like people extracting hard core scientific fact from certain religious teachings, because I knew that there's other scientific fact, you know, which sort of goes against that.  And I'm certainly not saying, you know, either is right or wrong, but I'm just trying to say that some of the descriptions were more limited.  And so--that if one, if one really wants to know the true story, you have to sort of cast the net a little bit wider, and interpret it a little bit more broadly.
Story_ID: 27161
Speaker 1: Were you a science fiction fan at all, I mean when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: And so, as a kid I used to like to read, you know, Spider Man and Superman and Batman, you know, the standard comic book stuff.  And as a kid, for sure, I watched 'Lost in Space' with Will Robinson.  But I was really a Star Trek fan.  I really liked Star Trek.  Star Trek, I think that came on on Thursday nights on NBC [National Broadcasting Company] at eight o'clock, you know.  And I was very, very young.  And I was enthralled with Mr. Spock because, you know, he wouldn't let himself get unhinged.  He would remain cool, no matter what.  And he would just solve all problems with science and logic.  I thought that was so cool.  Yeah, so--
Speaker 1: You were six years old when it started in 1965.
Speaker 2: That's exactly right, I was six years old.  That's exactly right.
Speaker 1: In lieu of what you do now, lasers, did you find phasers--
Speaker 2: I mean, I had, I mean, you know, I knew of phasers.  But then when I--I guess when I started to become aware of lasers, you know, "Gee, is a phaser like a laser?"  You know, and then again, you really don't know, that kind of stuff.  But yeah, I believe all of those things had some influence, you know, on me in terms of going into science.  Although, I'll be frank.  When I was getting ready to go to college, I really wanted to go to school for music.  You know, because I played drums and that was something that I really, really, really loved doing.  It was something just truly creative about it.  But how I got into engineering was that it became sort of clear that if you go to school and get a music degree, if you're planning on, you know, making it big, that can be kind of hard.  Not impossible, but the odds can be stacked against you.  There are so many other fantastic musicians out there, you know, some of which make money, some of which don't.  And so I said, "Well, you know, to provide a little backup, maybe what I would do is, I'll go to school to become like a studio engineer, a recording engineer."  Because a lot of my friends were going to school for engineering, and I said, "Well, studio engineering sounds like it's engineering, but it keeps me close to music."  So, I'm trying to ride the fine edge here.  And so, when I took a look at what schools I was going to be able to go to--because, you know, it was sort of clear that my sisters and I were going to be going to one of the colleges within the City University system [New York, New York].  It's just not financially possible for my dad to afford to pay for three kids going away to college all at the same time, because we were all basically a year apart.  And so, at that time the City University system was basically free.  And so, and I took a look at, you know, what schools had, you know, engineering.  You know the City College [of New York], CCNY, had engineering.  And I said, "Well, which one is closest to you, studio engineering or recording engineering?"  Well, that was electrical engineering.  And my thinking is, now, "Well, at least in studio engineering the instruments are electronic.  So, if I take electrical engineering, I'll at least know how the instruments are made," you know.  So, (laughter), I kept getting further and further away from music.  But ultimately as I got into taking courses in engineering--and it was math and science, which I always enjoyed, I started to find that I really liked it.  And I started becoming more back in tune with, you know, the physics and science that I liked as a kid.  And I really started to get excited about it.  And somewhere about maybe in the late sophomore year, I was thumbing through the course catalog one night, it was a Friday night.  It was pouring out, and I remember it was just too nasty to go out.  So, I was looking through the course catalog and I said, "What elective classes will I take?"  And so, I saw one class which said, "Introduction to Lasers."  And within that, it said, you know, "This course will cover the basic principles of fiber optic communication."  And this is now maybe 1977 or 1978, when there was a commercial on TV on AT and T--hear the pin drop, or something.  And the pin would fall and hit and bounce around.  And so, I thought wow, fiber optic communication.  This is sort of the newest, hottest way to be able to communicate and move information around, that's within the electrical engineering discipline.  And I thought to myself, if I got an expertise in this, perhaps even going to school and getting a Ph.D., getting an expertise in this would carry me to a career.  And it was that night that I made my decision--that I'm going to get an expertise in the area of optics and lasers.  And again, I was a sophomore in college.
Speaker 1: Now, it was Sprint that first advertised that--
Speaker 2: And so, maybe it was Sprint--
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: I'm not sure, maybe it was Sprint.  You know, but I remember "hear the pin drop," fiber optics, you know, I remember that.
Speaker 1: I remember that's why I got Sprint, I mean, on my home phone line, because I thought they had better optics.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But I didn't know.
Speaker 2: (laughter).
Story_ID: 27162
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite teacher, I mean any special teachers at the grade school level?
Speaker 2: Well, I had a fifth grade teacher.  Her name was Mrs. Middleton, Delores Middleton.  And I know she has had a tremendous impact on so many people.  She was maybe you know, four foot eleven, or five foot even, but she did not mess around.  She ran her class, you know, you did not mess around.  And she expected you to perform well.  There was no half-stepping in her class.  And she really gave everyone in that class a sense of pride.  This is in Springfield Garden now.  And the public school I went to was, you know, 99 percent, you know, African American.
Speaker 1: what was the name of that school?
Speaker 2: P.S. 15 [Public School 15].
Speaker 1: P.S. 15.
Speaker 2: P.S. 15 Q, for Queens.
Speaker 1: Okay, because you had gone to P.S. 31.
Speaker 2: 31.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: First in Bayside, and then P.S. 15.
Speaker 1: P.S. 15 Q.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: And she, so many people who have graduated from her class have gone on to be doctors, lawyers, architects, engineers.  Because she instilled a sense of pride in you, because many times, you know, coming--you may be coming up or growing up in environments where you're not necessarily getting that positive self-image.  Well, she was one for sure to give that to you.  She was African American, and had a college degree from Brooklyn College [New York, New York].  And she actually knew my stepmother.  They were sorority sisters, Delta Sigma Thetas.  And so, Mrs. Middleton was a fantastic elementary school teacher that literally, you know, made sure we were not messing around.  And then when I got to junior high school, there were a couple of good science teachers that I had that got me on the path.
Story_ID: 27163
Speaker 1: So, here's an interesting anecdote, with respect to the impact that Mrs. Middleton had on myself and my friends in school.  So, I was having a fortieth birthday party, and I invited back some of my friends who were in that class.  And I also, also invited Mrs. Middleton, because I just wanted many, many people that had an impact.  And she was so touched that she was invited, and that she saw other people from the same class.  She actually felt that the party really was for her.  She was so touched by that.  And that really made me feel good, because she could see the impact that she had on us.  And we were all successful out there, doing great things in the world.  And I was very, so happy, that she felt so good that she could have an opportunity to come and see what she had done for us.  She had a tremendous impact on us.  I'm just happy that she was still alive and that she had the time, and was healthy enough to come participate in that.
Speaker 2: That's pretty...  So, you said there were some other teachers in middle school, too, right?
Speaker 1: So, there were some other science teachers in middle school.  I think I had a science teacher, it might have been in seventh grade.  I believe her name was Mrs. Schuster, and she was very conservative.  And I believe that was middle school, yeah, and junior high school.
Speaker 2: Now what school--was that the same?
Speaker 1: No, that was I.S. 59.  I.S. stands for intermediate school.
Speaker 2: I.S. 59.
Speaker 1: I.S. 59. 'Q', for Queens, right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I was, I was in the SP class.  The SP program is where you're going to do three years of academic work in two years.  So, one year you're going to be in the seventh grade, the next year you're in the ninth grade.  And then you go to tenth grade. But you're doing seventh, eighth and ninth grade--and three years of work, in two.  And so, I can recall having science class with her.  And she was always so good, in terms of telling us what things not to do.  And so, you're a young kid (laughter) who's curious.  And she, and when she says, "And class, now, make sure you don't do this."  Well, you know, this kid is, "Oh, boy, that means something good is going to happen.  We definitely need to see what happens."  (laughter).  And so I was always, you know, one of the guys that was going to, you know, try the experiment, you know, to see exactly what was going to happen.  You're basically pushing the boundaries of science, is what I'll call it at this point.  But those were some of--
Speaker 2: It's like, don't mix this with that, or--
Speaker 1: (laughter).  That's an example, alright.  "Don't apply too much voltage to the poor frog."  (laughter).
Speaker 2: You crank it up-
Speaker 1: Well, I don't-- "Don't connect the circuit like this, it'll make the meter go wild."  And so, you do all of those things, just so you can see.  Nothing ever disastrous is going to happen, right, because they're not going to make any kind of experiment in a classroom where even if you did the wrong thing, it would be a disaster.  But you just know that when they say that, you're pushing, you're pushing the bounds of what the experiment is supposed to do.  And so, that then sort of inspired, continued to inspire, my creativity--the idea that there were areas, there were areas which you could in fact be allowed to explore, you know--which you know, which was just very, very fulfilling for me.
Story_ID: 27164
Speaker 1: Now where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: I went to Martin Van Buren High School.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's in the area of Queens Village, Queens [New York, New York]--and that school was mixed, maybe sixty/forty, perhaps, white, black, I think.  And most of the folks, which were African American, were bussed in from South Queens.  And so, that was sort of an effort for, to sort of integrate.  Because in the area that Martin Van Buren was situated in, it was predominantly a Caucasian community.  And so, I think they wanted to just try and do a better job in integrating high schools.
Speaker 1: So, is that an old Dutch community, Martin Van Buren School--
Speaker 2: Ahhhh, well, you know--
Speaker 1: I know he was a president and all that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was one of the presidents, but I believe a lot of the people that went there were--it was a mix--Jewish, Italian, you know, Polish.  I mean, you had everything, sort of classic Queens.  That's sort of classic Queens, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, Martin Van Buren High School.  Now, were you, did you continue in an accelerated kind of course?
Speaker 2: And so, yeah, I did very well in high school.  I graduated, ranked number forty-seventh out of eleven hundred students.  I did pretty good.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And of course, I took, you know, the three year sequences in math, science and language.  And a three year sequence means that you're taking math, science and a language for your, for, you know, three years at a minimum.  Although when I went to high school, I was--I started there in the tenth grade, because I had finished the ninth grade in intermediate school or junior high school.  And so, you know, by definition, you took your algebra in ninth grade which was back in junior high school.  But then you went on to take geometry and trigonometry.  That comprises the three year sequence.   As far as science, I think in ninth grade back in junior high school I took, I guess, general science or earth science, whatever it is.  Then in tenth grade, you're taking biology.  Eleventh grade, you're taking chemistry.  That comprises the three year sequence.  The same thing with language.  I took, you know, Spanish throughout.  I even took Spanish in the twelfth grade.  I even took math in the twelfth grade.  And so, you know, I was just thinking--no matter what I'm going to do, just to be strong in math and science was important.  And again, as I'm getting towards the twelfth grade, I'm thinking about, you know, "I'm going to go to school for engineering."  So, I wanted to make sure that my math and science was as strong as it possibly could, so when I got into my freshman year I'd be taking physics and calculus all at the same time.  And I wanted to continue to do well.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have any role models in science?  Did you know any scientists?
Speaker 2: No.  I absolutely knew no scientists, other than, you know, what you would see on TV.  You know, yeah, I really didn't know any scientists.  There were, there was a man who lived down the street, Bill Batton, William Batton.  And this is in Springfield Gardens.  He worked for IBM [International Business Machines Corporation], and worked on developing the IBM 360, 370 computer.  He was an African American guy.  And his son went on to be an engineer for Westinghouse.  And so that was, you know, two doors away from me.  And so, it was guys like that in my neighborhood that you'd hear about, going to school for engineering.  And so, that's why, you know, it was another reason why--you know, when I'm getting ready to go through high school, and you're seeing some of the older guys in the neighborhood going to school for engineering.  It was another kid two doors down the other way, the Wardlows.  There were two twins, Kevin and Kenny.  But his older brother, Chuck [Charles], went to U Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] for chemical engineering.  So, I had Chuck going to school for chemical engineering, and Bill going to school for electrical engineering.  And so, again, these are guys on the block who, again, whose parents said, you know, you're going to be going to college.  And so, these guys are going to school for engineering.  And so, that also probably helped to set in my mind that that's probably a decent path to take.

Speaker 1: When did you pick up the drums?
Speaker 2: I started playing the drums seriously when I  was in tenth grade.  Now, before that, probably when I was in maybe fifth or, maybe fifth grade--one of the twins, Kevin, Kevin Wordlaw, he had a snare drum and could play. He taught me how to do a roll, a drum roll.  And so, I could do that.  And I could do some simple things.  And so, when I was in high school, I was playing the clarinet.  I played high school--I played the clarinet through junior high school, in high school.  And one day the orchestra leader, or the band leader, said "Oh, man, you know, we just lost our drummer, our percussionist.  You know, we need someone to be able to play the drums."  So, I raised my hand and said, "I can play the drums."  He said, "You can't play the drums."  And so he's thinking, "What are we going to do?"  So, I said, "I can play the drums."  (laughter).  He says, "You can't play the drums."  He says, "So, what can you do?"  "I can play the drums."  He says, "Okay.  Do a drum roll."  Now mind you, this is the only darn thing, darn thing I could do.  (laughter).  And so I did a drum roll, and he was astonished.  So then he said, "Okay, do this.  Do tat tat, tat tat, zrrrrrrrllll, tat tat."  And so that was tapping the thing with the drum roll.  So, I could do this.  He said, "Guess what?  You're in.  You're the new drummer."  So, that's how I started playing music in the senior band in high school.  At the end of the year, I think I got a 99 [percent] on my report card.  And I brought it home to my dad and said, "Dad, see, I can play the drums."  And so, I'd always wanted a drum set.  And so, drums were pretty expensive, as I'm sure you know.  And so, I said, you know, "Can I have a drum set?"  So he says "Well, you know, I'm not going to necessarily buy you, just go out and buy a drum set.  But why don't we do this?  Why don't we see if we can find perhaps a used drum set from the Penny Saver?  And why don't you, you know, go around and ask your relatives and, you know, do odd ends and work for them over the summer.  You know, do this for Grandma.  Go out to Uncle Bill's house, do stuff for him.  Do this, do that, and save up your pennies and we'll see if we can go and buy a drum set."  And so, I said, "Okay, deal."  And so at the end of the summer, I'd saved up some money.  It wasn't enough, but we found a set.  And so he says, "Don't worry, Pete.  I'll cover the rest."  And so we drove up to somewhere in the Bronx [New York, New York], in Riverdale, bought this drum set home, and you know, that's how I started.  And I started playing the drums.  And then I dropped off the track team to sort of play drums, because I felt I was going to join a band, and the possibility of meeting girls was much better being a drummer in a street band than in running track.  (laughter).  So, that's how that started.
Story_ID: 27166
Speaker 1: So did you get with a band?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  We were pretty good. We were--
Speaker 1: And what kind of music did you play?
Speaker 2: And so, we played primarily sort of R and B and funk.  And then we also played what I guess you'd now refer to, you know, sort of fusion jazz.  So, it was more sort of--  So, instead of straight up 1960s jazz, you know, it was the flavor of, you know, Miles Davis or something like that.  Kind of the guys like Herbie Hancock, you know--that kind of style of music was sort of musicians' music that we started to play.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the fusion thing was really starting to grow in '72' [1972], '73' [1973].
Speaker 2: Right.  Oooh, exactly.  That's exactly the timeframe.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Mizell Brothers were producing stuff, you know,
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Herbie Hancock out, 'Head Hunters'--
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.  That's exactly right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's exactly right.  You hit it on the head.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Chick Corea, Herbie Hancock, Billy Cobb, and those guys.
Speaker 1: Oh, Bill Cobb, wow.  Was he your favorite drummer?
Speaker 2: He was my, he was my idol.  He was my idol.  He was, you know, the drummer's drummer.  And then there was the guy, Lenny White.  He played for Chick Corea's group, 'Return to Forever.'  And the reason why Lenny White was particularly noteworthy--well, both--Billy Cobb grew up in Brooklyn, but played for like a marching band in St. Albans when he was a kid.  And Lenny White grew up in the neighborhood, in St. Albans, and around that area.  So, these were like star drummers.  I mean literally, you know, star drummers that came out of my neighborhood.  And so, that was very inspiring for me.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Billy Cobb was just unbelievable.
Speaker 2: Unbelievable.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: If you were to listen to me, my style is--people would say, "Wow, your style is a lot like Cobb's style."  Because I just have that very powerful single stroke roll that he's known for, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, I mean, if you were playing like that, or anywhere close to that--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I could see why you were thinking of drumming as--
Speaker 2: Right. Yeah, we were very good.  I mean, our band would play--and we would record music with some little cassette tapes.  And we would sort of, you know, back in the day you'd have your--carry your music with you, (laughter) and play it.  And people would hear the music and say, "Wow, I mean, who's that?"  You know, I said, "Oh, that's our band.  That's our band."  And they were like, you know, "What album is that?"  "That's not an album, that's our band."  Yeah, I thought we were pretty good.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of your band?
Speaker 2: One of the names of the bands was Universal--Universal Sound, or Universal--Universal Sound, yeah, Universal Sound.  And it was a pretty big band.  We had a lead guitar, rhythm guitar.  We had maybe three horn players, a keyboard player, a bass guitarist, drummer, congas, you know.  We had a pretty full set, about eight people.  So--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a pretty good size band, yeah.  So, okay.  So, I can see now--
Speaker 2: We didn't make a penny, but we had a lot of fun playing. (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did you meet enough females-
Speaker 2: Na, na, na, na, no.  (laughter).  Because what happened was--as we got, you know, into college, all of us were pursuing rigorous majors.  You know--accounting, you know, pre-law, pre-medicine, and engineering.  And all of us got refocused in doing well in our studies, and sort of, the band sort of fell apart.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That happens.
Speaker 1: Alright.  So, I think, I don't know, I didn't mention--but I know Louis Armstrong was from Queens [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: That's right.  Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald.  Right there--James Brown had a house right there on London Boulevard.  I think Count Basie also lived there in Queens.  I think there were several important jazz musicians that lived sort of in the same Albans area.  As a matter of fact, if you go to Facebook, there is a page which I think is called 'You Know You're from Jamaica, Queens,' or something like that.  And many times, they'll show the houses of the famous musicians.  And so, it's sort of like a test, you know.  "You know you're from Jamaica, Queens, if you know who lived in this house."  And then people will respond, you know, accordingly, right.
Speaker 1: I think Louis Armstrong passed away in the '70s [1970s].  Did he pass away in the '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  As a matter of fact, I think Louis Armstrong, I think he's buried in Flushing--is buried in Flushing Cemetery, the place where the other relatives are buried.  But he lived, he lived in the south side a little bit, there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I thought I'd mention it because he was such an international ambassador for--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --music.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: And being right there--I know they keep his tapes at Queens College [City University of New York, Queens, New York, New York], I think, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 27167
Speaker 1: So, when you were on the verge of graduating, what, from high school, you knew you were going to City College?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: City University [of New York, New York, New York], I mean.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was going to go to CCNY, the City College of the City University of New York, simply because it was the only college within the community system that had the engineering program.  The other schools had sort of the pre-engineering curricula--the calculus, the physics, chemistry, etc.  But the engineering courses themselves were up at CCNY.  And so I said, "Why bother going to, you know, Queens College for two years and then have to transfer to City?  I'll just go there immediately.  And that way I'll get to know the place, I'll know the faculty."  And so, that's what I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you graduated from Martin Van Buren [high school] in '77 [1977]?
Speaker 2: Seventy-Six, [1976].
Speaker 1: Seventy-Six, [1976], okay.
Speaker 2: Nineteen-seventy-six.
Speaker 1: Because you were like a year ahead of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, because I got skipped, I got skipped between the seventh and the ninth grade in the SP Program.  That's exactly right.
Speaker 1: So, this is the [United States] Bicentennial year.
Speaker 2: That is correct.  I was a Bicentennial, Bicentennial graduate.  That's exactly--that was big back then.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Everything was Bicentennial.  That is exactly correct.
Speaker 1: That's true.  I, you know, it almost slipped past me.
Speaker 2: (laughter).  I remember they were selling bicycles, which were Bicentennial bicycles.  Yeah, and actually that's what I got for my high school graduation, was a bike, ten speed bike.  Oh, man, and I was happy.  I was happy as can be.  Now, I tell that to students nowadays, because kids--when they graduate from high school, they want cars.  They want automobiles.  I'm like, "Automobiles?  You got to be crazy.  When I graduated from high school, I got a ten speed bike, and I was ecstatic."  And they just sort of look at me like, you know, this guy's from, you know, the Stone Age.  (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, alright.  So, City University of New York.  Now, did you live on campus?  Did you commute?
Speaker 2: No, I mean it's, there were no dorms.  Yeah, it's primarily a metropolitan university where everyone commutes.  They, I do believe now they do have some student housing, which is primarily for graduate students.  But basically everyone who goes to Queens College, Brooklyn College--you know, Hunter College, City College, whatever--everybody's commuting back and forth.  Everyone lives at home or somewhere.
Speaker 1: So, what campus did you attend?
Speaker 2: So, the one up on 138th Street and Convent Avenue.  That's up in Harlem [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right there, you know, Convent Avenue runs parallel to Amsterdam.  And it's right between Broadway, between Broadway and Amsterdam--Convent Avenue.  And the reason why it's called Convent Avenue is because the school is, in fact, in buildings that were an old nunnery, an old convent.  That's correct.
Speaker 1: I know that's also--I mean the High School for the Performing Arts, I mean, that's--
Speaker 2: Boom, right there, right there on campus.  Right there on the City College campus.
Speaker 1: It's really dramatic, you know--landscape.
Speaker 2: Yes, it's beautiful.  It's beautiful.  And one of the, the nice features about CCNY that a lot of people don't know, with respect to, in terms of its academic excellence, is that it is the institution which has the largest number of Nobel Prize winners as alumni.  So, there are nine Nobel Prize winners that come out of the City College, nine.  That's more than any other institution in the world.
Speaker 1: I did not know that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And so, now all of these people who got their Nobel Prize, they went there as undergraduate students in chemistry, physics, or electrical engineering, typically.
Speaker 1: Okay, just undergraduates.
Speaker 2: So, they didn't do their graduate work there, nor were they professors which did research there where they got their Nobel Prize.  But they were all sort of undergraduate students, and that is correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, that speaks highly of the program.
Speaker 2: That's correct.  And back in the day, I mean, at the City College--that was where Albert Einstein gave his first public lecture when he came over to the U.S.  And the City College was known as the "Proletariat Harvard".  That's what it was sort of referred to.
Speaker 1: Now, that's in Harlem there?  I mean, Columbia [University, New York, New York] is not that far away.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Columbia is on 116th Street and Broadway.  And CCNY is up 138th Street--135th Street, something like that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's the center for a lot of intellectual activity in Harlem--
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: --I know, in those days.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Story_ID: 27168
Speaker 1: What was it like at City College of New York [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: It was, it was a, I felt, a great time.  It was a time when there was sort of open enrollment.  Going there, it was free.  All you had to pay was, I think, a fifty dollar matriculation fee.  And so, yeah, you had to buy your own textbooks.  But basically, if you lived in New York City, and you had the grades, you could get in.  And it was quite a vibrant campus.  And this was in the time of sort of--you know--I started there in 1976.  And as it went on to, you know, '77 [1977], '78 [1978], there was sort of a big, you know, change in sort of, I guess we would call it rap music nowadays.  And so one of my colleagues, or students there, who wasn't in the engineering program--was Russell Simmons--was right there on campus, as was Curtis Blow.  These are, you know, guys which sort of went out into the real world and, you know, made it big.  I mean, Russell Simmons is very, very popular, you know, and started Def Comedy Jam and Def Poets, and has a clothing line and, you know, all of this kind of stuff.  And Curtis Blow wound up being sort of a key performer, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Curtis Blow I think is known as the first rapper, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, as an example, right.
Speaker 1: 'These are the Breaks.'  Is that--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's it.  That's the song, 'These are the Breaks.'  And that's one of them, that's for sure.  And he's got a Christmas one.  There are several, several, several.  But Russell Simmons was the guy that probably got all of them started.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All of them started--yeah.  And my whole neighborhood in Queens--you know, Run-D.M.C. is, as you know, Reverend Run is Russell's brother, you know.  Correct.  So, this is sort of New York City, City College--growing up in Queens, and all of that stuff.  (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a great time.
Speaker 1: I know people tend to think of the rap generation as being a lot younger, but these guys are, you know, they're not young.
Speaker 2: They're my age.  (laughter).
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: Right. (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, these guys are in their fifties.
Speaker 2: Mid-fifties now.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, okay.  This is a time when music was going through a transition?
Speaker 2: Yes, music was going through a transition, right.  But the campus was great.  You know, I had a lot of very good professors, you know.  And I viewed--the key thing was I viewed going to school not as going to school, I viewed going to school as my job.  That was a change in philosophy.  When you're going to high school, you go to school because you're supposed to go to school.  You know, by law, you're supposed to go to school.  When I got into college, I said, I said, "You know, this is different.  You know, I'm working on this for my career."  And someone early, early on when I got into college, I think maybe within the first year, they said, "How many of you are engineers?"  And no one raised their hands.  And he said, "Let me tell you, you are now an engineer."  And so, I said, "Whoa, I've just been accepted," you know.  And as a result, I used that as an opportunity to change my philosophy--that going to class was not an option, that's an obligation.  You know, doing your homework is not an option, that's an obligation.  That's like if your employer says, "You will show up for work on time, and these are the things we're giving you to do, you know, because that's going to feed our bottom line for the company, and that's what you need to do."  That's the way I viewed my homework.  You've got to go up, you've got to show up, you've got to work hard.  You've got to do the job.  And that's how I, that's how I viewed it.  And there were some other students that I know that didn't.  You know, we all had part time jobs.  And I had a part time job, too.  And some students said, "Well, you know, gee, I'm tired, you know.  I'm going-- I've got to work later today, so I'm not--I'm going to cut class, I'm going to go to work."  I'm like, "No, that's the wrong, that was the wrong decision, you know."
Story_ID: 27169
Speaker 1: You said when you were a sophomore, that's when you decided to get into the field of lasers.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And what was it, again, that got you involved?
Speaker 2: And so the thing, you know, the thing which happened was--you know, you're going along.  You're taking your classes, your physics, your calculus, your differential equations.  And then you start taking your engineering core--circuit theory, digital systems control, communications, whatever it is.  But then they allow you to take some, some elective classes, you know, within the discipline.  And so, there are so many electives.  How do you choose?  And then my thinking is I want to sort of choose an elective where I'm going to have, like, a focus.  I want to choose all of my electives in a certain area, so I can get a real strong expertise.  So, I'm just sort of looking through the course catalog.  It's like looking at the menu, and just kind of reading what the different courses are about.  Some are about computer architecture.  Some are about, you know, circuit systems and digital systems.  But then I saw this one course about "Introduction to Lasers."  And then you kind of read the description, and everything is fine.  And you read the last line and it says, you know, "The fundamentals and introduction to fiber optic communications will be covered in this course."  And you know, what occurred to me, is that there are sort of other areas within electrical engineering that are--at that time were not growing.  And one in particular might be sort of power systems.  How do you deliver power?  Con Ed [Con Edison], and this and that, and the other thing.  Not super high-tech, not saying it can't be.  But then I'm thinking, you know, "Gee, if an area in engineering is so mature, you know, there's not a lot of area for growth and expansion."  And so I'm thinking, "If I want to get an expertise in something, I want to pick an area which is very, very new and futuristic, so there's going to be a lot of chance for growth and expansion."  Because as that field grows and expands, I can basically evolve within that, and manage to make my way through an entire career.  That was my philosophy.  Because if the field is too narrow and not growing--if things get tight and there's nowhere to grow--you know, where do you go?  It's not clear.  And it wasn't clear to me at that time.  And so, that's how I started.  And so, the other thing which really got me going, I took a look at the elective classes.  It said electromagnetic theory.  So I said, well, I'm already taking that.  But another class was, you know, 'Introduction to Optics,' you know, physical optics.  So I said, that was a prerequisite, not necessarily--excuse me--it wasn't a requirement, but it was sort of nice if you had taken it.  So, the next semester I went and I took the optics class.  And the guy who was teaching that is a famous laser physicist, who literally--you know, after having the class with him--that was it, I'm going to school to get a Ph.D.  There was no turning back at that point.  They had me hook, line and sinker.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 27170
Speaker 1: So the thing was, I, I was taking this optics class, physical optics.  And this was being taught by this professor, Robert Alfano.  He's a very famous guy now.  And he's maybe seventy-two, and he's still very active in the field.  But the thing--a very Italian kind of guy, a New York Italian guy--and he had some major discoveries.  But the interesting thing that really caught me was that, you know, I go into this class on the first day, and it's like a classic physics class, very few people.  And so I walk in, and I think there were four people sitting--one, two, three, four, in a row.  And he walks in and he looks at the people, and he says, "I know you, I know you, and I know you," because they were all physics students.  He says, "You."  And he points at me.  "I don't know you.  Who are you?"  So I said, "Hi, I'm Pete Delfyett.  I'm a Double E [electrical engineer]."  (laughter).  So he says, "Double E's, you guys are turkeys.  Get out of here."
Speaker 2: (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, I was so enamored by this, even though someone might be taken aback by that style.  But I felt, "Wow, this guy treats me like my uncles."  I'm feeling love here, right.  (laughter).  So, that really sort of made me feel good.  And more importantly, as I would take his class, you know, sure, we'd learn all of the important material.  But at the end of the lesson everyday, he would stop, and within the last ten minutes he would then talk about how what we did in class was being applied in his state of the art research lab.  And then one day, he took me into his lab to show that he was able to make light that could turn on and off in less than a trillionth of a second, and use these bursts of light to watch the atom, the movement of atoms and electrons in condensed matter.  And you see the lights blinking, and you know that things are happening on trillions of a time scale.  And you'd see the light flashing, and he'd say, "Did you see that?"  And I'd say, "Yes."  He said, "That was a picosecond."  I'm like, "Wow, this is just fantastic."  And I was really, really hooked.  I was really, really hooked at that point. And I said, you know, I'm going to go to school and I'm going to get my Ph.D., and this is the kind of research that I want to do.
Speaker 2: How short is a picosecond?
Speaker 1: A picosecond is one-trillionth of a second, a trillion.  And a trillion is a one with twelve zeroes.  So, here's how you can get to that.  Take a second.  You divide that second up into a million pieces.  You take that one million and divide that up into another million pieces.  And that thing that's left over is a picosecond.  Let me break it down also.  In one second, light can travel one hundred and eighty-six thousand miles.  That's almost from the earth to the moon.  In one picosecond, light travels a distance of about the thickness of that piece of paper you have in your hand.  Wow!  I mean, well, excuse me, I'm ex--(laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, that is a cause for us saying wow, and--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, we can actually, the human eye can actually see a picosecond?
Speaker 1: Well, what happens is the eye will see the flash, but the persistence of the image in the eye and the brain will last for about one-twentieth of a second.  So, the light is on and off.  So, the light will sort of turn on and off, but then the response of the eye will sort of turn on and just stay on.  And so, yes, the light--your eye will respond to it, but it does not respond as fast.  So, your eyes can see the light, your eyes can see the photons, but it doesn't turn on and off rapidly.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, your nervous system kind of, just kind of mulls over this.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's correct.  It's sort of like, it's sort of like, it's sort of like--if you were to take a pin, and have a pin--  And boom, boom--you know, go in and out real quick, like let's say a picosecond, whatever.  You know, your hand will then feel that for a little while.  So, the response is there, but the sensations, or the memory of that lives on for a longer period of time.
Speaker 2: I thought about if somebody hit you in the head with a board, you'd have--
Speaker 1: (laughter)
Speaker 2: --a headache for a couple of days.
Speaker 1: That makes some sense.
Speaker 2: (simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: (simultaneous).  The amount of time that the board is contact with your head is very short, but the pain lasts for a long time.  Excellent analogy.
Speaker 2: Okay, alright.  So--
Speaker 1: So, you're going to be an ultrafast optical physicist before you know it.
Speaker 2: Maybe when we get finished, we'll go to the lab--
Speaker 1: (laughter). Go to the lab.
Speaker 2: --and see if I can do it, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I'll aim it at something and--
Speaker 1: There you go.
Story_ID: 27171
Speaker 1: City College [of New York] in New York [New York] is--was it fairly well equipped for the study of lasers?
Speaker 2: And so in--there were just a few pockets, primarily, you know, two or three faculty that were working on the area of lasers, you know, there.  So, I worked with both of them as an undergraduate student.  And then when I was getting ready to graduate, on one hand I wanted to work with Professor [Robert] Alfano, but he was a physicist and I was an electrical engineer.  And that would have been difficult for me to do research, you know, in his group.  Because as a physics professor, he can grant Ph.D.'s to physics students, not electrical engineering students.  And so, now, if I wanted to work with him, I'd have to sort of be a physics student.  And if I changed majors, I could have done that in graduate school, but then I'd need to sort of re-take, well, the undergraduate's physics curriculum that would qualify me to be a physics student.  So, that didn't seem to be the right path to take.  So, plus I decided I wanted to experience something different.  So, I applied to graduate school, and was accepted to go to school at the University of Rochester in Rochester, New York.  And they have a big, big laser institute--or optics school, up at the University of Rochester.  It's called the Institute of Optics.  Now, and I'll be the first to admit that when I was an undergraduate applying to the University of Rochester, I was a little bit naive, because back at City College, you know, you just had conventional departments--electrical engineering and physics.  And my physics professor was in charge of something he called the Institute for Ultrafast Spectroscopy and Lasers.  So, at Rochester they had the Institute of Optics.  So, I just thought, oh, that's an institute like Professor Alfano's institute.  So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to apply to the Department of Electrical Engineering and say that I want to be in the Institute of Optics, doing optics.  And so, I got back my acceptance letter.  I got a full scholarship, you know.  I got the tuition, I got the room and board.  I got everything.  And so when I got there, it became clear that I was really an electrical engineering student, and that the Optics Institute was really not an optics institute, but it was a separate optics program where people were getting Ph.D.'s in the area of optics.  I wasn't aware of that.  And so, that became apparent almost within the first week that I was there.  And the story--what happened was--you know, the chairman of the Double E [Electrical Engineering] department said, "Well, gee, Peter, what courses would you like to take?"  And so I said, "Oh, of course, well, I want to take Optics course one, and Optics course two, Optics course three."  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And he said, "Well, you know, gee, that's fine and dandy, but you know, you have to pass the Ph.D. exam in Double E.  And so, we think you need to take Double E one, Double E two, Double E three"  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And I'm like, "Oh."  So I'm like, "Well, when do I get a chance to take the optics classes?"  So he says, "Well, you know, that's sort of, you know, in the optics program.  You're in the Double E program."  So, it's becoming clearer.  So, okay, so I said, "Well, okay, fine. We can go along with this."  And so, to sort of condense the story, after one year I pick up my master's degree.  At the end of two years, I pass the Ph.D. exam for candidacy.  So, I go into candidacy and they say, "Okay, now you're a Ph.D. candidate.  You know, we want you to work with one of the Double E faculty."  And so, I'm saying, "But gee, you know, I've done everything you said.  I now want to go and do optics."  So they said, "Well, you know, we're paying your tuition and we're paying your salary.  We want you to work with the Double E faculty, because that's where the money is coming from.  We're not going to pay your salary and tuition so you can work on the research project of another professor in another department."  So I said, "Oh, okay."  And so--and they said, "You know, and whatever you do, don't go behind our backs and speak to people over there." (laughter).  So, I said "Well, you know, let me explore that option anyway."  And so--and so now, as a faculty, I really understand what was going on.  I mean--and I can get to that.  But--so I went over to the Optics Institute.  I said, "Gee, you know, I passed the Ph.D. exam, and I really want to work here."  And he said, "Well, you know, gee, we have our own students that we have to support.  You know, why should we take you, you know, when we have our own students to support?"  So I said, "Well, you know, I'll start from the beginning.  I'll take the optics classes."  He said, "Well, you know, yes, we understand that.  But you've already got a couple years of Double E behind you, you know.  Why should we do that, when we can take someone fresh?"  You know, and so--you know, I'm sort of starting to get, you know, a little bit of the run-around.  And there was one optics faculty that I think was--that was willing to take me.  But then I keep hearing in the back of my mind, you know:  "And whatever you do, don't go behind our back and do this."  So, I'm thinking you know, well, gee, if I do this, you know, and it comes time to defend my thesis, they might be pretty unhappy with me."  So, it turns out that at this time, one of my good friends who's still at City College, he says, "Hey Pete, guess what?  Your old professor, Professor Alfano, is now made a joint appointment in electrical engineering, which now means he is allowed to have electrical engineering students doing Ph.D. with him."  So at that point, I said, "You know, my whole goal was always to go somewhere to do this ultrafast optical science, optical physics.  And so, if they're not going to let me do it at Rochester, I'm going to come back to New York and do it, because now I have that opportunity," where before, back in New York, I didn't.  And so, I went back to New York.  I made a pitch to Professor Alfano.  He gave me a copy of a proposal and said, "If you want it, this is what we're going to do. Contact me."  And so, to make a long story short, I said, "Yes, this is what I want to do."  And at the end of my third year at Rochester, I moved back from Rochester--back to New York City, and moved back with my grandparents, and went to work for Professor Alfano back up at CCNY [City College of New York].

Speaker 1: What I have here is that you describe yourself as an electrical engineer working in the area of photonics, right?
Speaker 2: Right, that's exactly right.
Speaker 1: And explain what photonics are.
Speaker 2: Sure.  Photonics, I'd like to make an analogy.  Electrons are to electronics as the same way as photons are to photonics.  So, in the same way that we use electricity in devices like transistors, capacitors, inductors--so we can make, you know, solid state devices that use electricity to do something for us--whether it's like making computers or making cell phones or camera equipment, audio equipment--photonics is the same kind of concept, where we use properties of light to be able to do things for us.  To maybe make computers work faster, to make novel types of video displays, to make imaging systems, or glasses that you can wear and see a video display--kind of like the Google Glasses that they're making nowadays.  We make technologies that make the internet go faster.  We make computers work faster.  We make lasers that can cut holes through walls, you know.  Photonics is a technology, or enabling area, that allows many other areas of science and technology to exist.  So, it's the use of light for making technology work better.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's photonics.
Speaker 1: The applied use of light on--
Speaker 2: The applied use of light, yeah.
Speaker 1: There we go.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  See, in a few words you did it so much better than I did.  (laughter).
Story_ID: 27173
Speaker 1: You got your Ph.D. in 1988, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And so, well, explain what your Ph.D. dissertation was about.
Speaker 2: Sure.  And so, the goal was to try to use these short bursts of light to see if we could measure how molecules could vibrate, and see how long these vibrations would last.  So, this area of optical physics, we call it time resolved raman spectroscopy.  And so, what I did, which was unique, was to be able to take a laser system, and in one shot, be able to shine it on a sample and examine the light which comes off.  And by looking at that light, I could tell all the different possible ways the structure, these atoms connected together, or molecules, all the different possible ways they could vibrate.  I could tell you every possible vibrational mode.  And I could also measure how long these vibrations would last, meaning that if I were to sort of hit it or kick the mass on a spring--  It's like two balls connected by a spring, like a slinky.  And you pop it--brrrrrrr, and it oscillates.  I could tell you how long those lasted.  So, normally, the way you would do that, you'd have to take a laser pulse, and tune the color of the laser light to be resonant with one mode of vibration.  And then you'd have to repeat the experiment over and over and over, to sort of build up a moving picture to see how long these vibrations would last.  And so, I was the one that came up the technique where with one pulse, I could see all the different possible vibrations by using a special burst of white light.  That was one of the things that my advisor was famous for, this sort of white laser light.  And also be able to monitor and see how long these vibrations last.  Now, why is that important, you might say?  Well, it turns out that many times when you have, you know, materials--semiconductors or crystals--and you put, you know, energy into it.  Whatever kind of energy it is, the energy must go somewhere.  It's sort of like taking a bunch of balls and putting it up at the top of mountain.  So, you're taking, you know, stuff which has--you know, that's not moving--and you're putting potential energy into it by raising its height.  And you're putting it on top of the mountain, and then you're letting it go.  And then all of this potential energy, you know, winds up going to the balls rolling down the mountain, that's sort of, you know, kinetic energy.  And so, these vibrational modes are ways in which energy can sort of, they serve as a mechanism at which energy can decay in the sample.  It's sort of like the different path that the balls can take from the top of the mountain back down to the ground floor, or the ground state.  And by looking at how these energy pathways exist and what's possible, you can then either design material or matter in new ways, so that they can perform better, handle heat better, transmit electricity better.  So, their material property characteristics can be improved to make better devices.  So, that's what I was doing as a grad student.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the white light's important, I guess.  But I'm just thinking here.  Is it because it's the full spectrum of--
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right.  The white light was important because--
Speaker 1: Spectroscopy.
Speaker 2: It has the full spectrum.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And where--and so, it turns out that the sample will look for that color in the white light, to make its vibrational mode vibrate.  So, the continuum is important, but the special single shot technique where I could basically monitor the evolution of these vibrations in real time, was very, very important.  And I recognize how important that was when I was getting ready to graduate.  There were some guys out at Lawrence Livermore [National Laboratory, Livermore, California], they wouldn't tell me exactly what they were doing.  But I believe that they were involved in--let's just put it, some extremely energetic explosions which occur under--deep underneath the ground.  And they wanted to monitor these events, watching what happens.  And as you can imagine, any kind of diagnostic tool which you can use that can capture a tremendous amount of information--which my technique could do--but more importantly, do it with one shot, becomes very important.  Because as you can imagine--and there are experiments--they're not allowed to repeat their experiments over and over multiple times a day, right, right.  (laughter).  They get one shot a year, you know.  I don't know--you know, these underground nuclear tests.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your one shot technique of--
Speaker 2: One shot spectroscopic technique.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, so that was kind of neat.
Story_ID: 27174
Speaker 1: What was the demand for your services after graduation [from City University of New York, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: So then after that, I went to work at Bell Communications Research.
Speaker 1: This is a big deal, to--
Speaker 2: It's a big deal.
Speaker 1: --when you work for Bell.
Speaker 2: That's correct.  It was a big deal.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It was a big deal.  It was an honor, a real honor.  And I had a choice to go to work at Bell Laboratories in Holmdel [New Jersey] or Bell Communication Research in Red Bank [New Jersey].  And these were the two research facilities, you know, one exit down from the highway.  The difference was in 1988--these labs were basically the same in 1984, but what happened in 1984, MCI Sprint sued AT and T for being a monopoly.  And MCI Sprint won.  And so, what happened was, the judge, Judge Green, basically divided AT and T, the monopoly, into two companies, one which was going to be AT and T that handled the long distance stuff.  And the other part of the company was going to handle the local communications, of which they then took that company and divided it up into the seven Baby Bells.  So then, the Bell Laboratories, they took and split down the middle.  Half of it went with the long distance carrier, the other half went to provide the research for the seven Baby Bells.  And I had an opportunity to go work for the long distance research lab as a postdoctoral research fellow, or I had the opportunity to be a full-fledged member of the technical staff at Bell Communications Research.  And that's the one I opted for.
Speaker 1: Is that the one they call Bellcore?
Speaker 2: Bellcore, that's exactly right.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: I went to work for Bellcore, that's exactly right.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  So, did they recruit you, basically?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And so, the interesting thing was, I had interviews at Bell Labs and Bellcore.  And it was at a time when there was a hiring freeze.  And I know I had the interview at Bell Labs.  And there was another fellow there that wanted to hire me.  His name was Anthony Johnson.  You might know him.  He's another prominent African American, you know, in the area of ultrafast science.  And while he did his Ph.D. research at Bell Laboratories, his official Ph.D. advisor--since Bell Labs doesn't give Ph.D. degrees--his official Ph.D. advisor was my advisor, [Dr. Robert] Bob Alfano.  Bob Alfano's probably graduated some of the most, you know, African Americans in the area of ultrafast science.  Anyway, so Tony wanted to hire me into his group at Bell Labs.  And then I was getting feedback from Bellcore.  There was a hiring freeze.  And so I said, "Why don't you just, you know, have me come in and just give me a, let me give a seminar, you know."  So, I was just viewing it as just sort of more practice.  So I got there, and I'm sitting in one of the manager's office.  And so, he's on the phone.  He says, "Oh, the interview candidate is here."  And I'm thinking to myself, "Holy Cow, I wish they would have told me, I would have worn my better suit."  (laughter).  So, so, let me tell you, I made the best of it.  So, I went and I gave a presentation.  And I remember when my presentation was over, one of the area vice presidents walked out the room with me and said, "That was fantastic.  We know that you're interviewing at Bell Labs.  Have they made you an offer?"  So, I said, "Well, I'm thinking about it."  So, he says, "Don't take it.  We're going to make you an offer."  So, I said "Okay."  And that's, that was a great day for me.  That truly was a great day, that was a great day.  It was very unexpected.
Story_ID: 27175
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your experience [at Bell Communications Research, Red Bank, New Jersey].
Speaker 2: My experience there?
Speaker 1: Yeah, uh huh.
Speaker 2: So, so then I had the, an opportunity to work in two different areas.  The area that I chose was to try to take kind of what I'll call laser pointer technology, little semiconductor lasers.  Those are the devices that are in laser pointers--and to be able to create these very, very short bursts of light.  And I was using light in spectroscopy--but to use these very short bursts of light in applications related to its fiber optic communications and signal processing.  Now, the lasers that I worked with back as a grad student were about as big as this meeting table here.  You know, about, you know, about three meters long.  You needed a, you know, not quite a power plant to power it, but, you know, yeah--pretty significant stuff.  And the devices that they wanted me to work with were the size of a head of a pin.  And you could operate off of watch batteries.  And this was something, a brand new area, that I really knew nothing about.  And when I took the position I said, "Well, gee if I'm really successful, this can really have a tremendous impact on fiber optic communications, etc."  And so, I said, "Yes, I'll take the job, okay."  So, now that I've done that, there were a couple of people who had said, "Oh, my God, why did you pick that area?  There are so many dead bodies down that path."  Which means that there were so many other top research scientists that have tried to crack that problem, but were not successful.  And so now, I'm thinking, "Oh, my God, what did I get myself into?"  So, I said, "Well you know, I'm not going to give up.  This is a challenge, and it's going to be like grabbing the horns of a bull.  Either I'm going to tame this thing, or, or I'm going to die on the bullhorns trying."  So I said, "I don't care, I'm just going to do it."  And to make a long story short, you know, after about eighteen months, I was able to break the world record in terms of how short the pulse could be and how bright it could be.  There was a lot that happened in that eighteen months, and a lot of good things that fell into place.  But I was very, very happy that I had good people around me, you know--other good scientists that had faith in what I could do, that could kind of point the way to possible solutions and opportunities, ways to network with people so I could get the right things to be able to make this, make this happen.  And so, I was very happy.  And in eighteen months, having broken the world record, my upper level management was very, very happy with me.  And at that point, you really, you really then know you're part of the Bell Labs team.  Because everyone--even  when you walk in there as a young guy--everyone up and down the hall, is world famous for something.  And you're just the new kid on the block.  And everybody is looking, just looking at you, thinking, "You know, is the guy going to sink or is he going to swim?"  You know, and everybody is there to help you, but they can't do your work for you.  And so, when you're able to sort of make that big splash, everybody's super happy, super duper happy.
Story_ID: 27176
Speaker 1: You used the continuum, a continuum light pulse to do this [make the shortest and brightest light pulse], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you explain how--
Speaker 2: And so, the continuum light pulse, that was with, that was a white light with graduate--it was in the graduate work.  At Bell Comm-at Bellcore [Red Bank, New Jersey], the thing was--what really enabled me to make this technology work was that, you know, these sort of laser pointers, semiconductor devices, were created in such a way that the device itself, when you apply energy to it, it becomes a laser right away.  And in order for this thing to produce pulses, I would have to somehow convert this laser--not into a laser--but just convert it to a light amplifier.  And then take this laser chip and then situate it in between an optical resonator. And that was very, very hard.  Because in order to do that, you have to take this semiconductor laser chip, and somehow process the front and the back, cleaved facets of this crystal--so that it has absolutely no reflectivity. And that is the approach that many people were trying, and it was very, very difficult to make happen.  Well, it turns out that another colleague of mine, Gerry [Gerard] Alphonse, who wound up being at the Sarnoff Labs in Princeton [New Jersey]--he wound up being president of IEEE [Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]--and another African American scientist with roots from Haiti, was in fact doing a trick with these semiconductor lasers, where he was making these semiconductor devices act as just basic high powered LEDs [light emitting diodes].  And he was doing something where he would sort of fabricate the little electrical contact, not perpendicular with respect to these cleaved facets, but at a slight angle.  So, what we would say, you know-- in the tech-- the words of photonics--he was fabricating a--the optical wave guide, you know, at a small angle with respect to the, you know, the standard orthogonal directions.  Instead of going back and forth between the cleaved facets, he fabricated the wave guide at about a five degree angle.  Then he could put anti-reflection coatings on the front and back facet.  And it made it so much easier for this device to be like an optical amplifier.  He had no intention of these things being optical amplifiers.  But that's what I saw.  And I saw that if I could have access to some of those devices, we could make this happen.
Speaker 1: So, did this--is this the result of the collegial environment at Bell?  I mean, being able to look at what somebody else--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Not only at Bell, but across laboratories.  And this was at the old RCA Labs [RCA Laboratories], which is in Princeton [New Jersey], which had nothing to do with Bell Labs or Bellcore.
Speaker 1: At Sarnoff [Laboratory], yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.  And so, it just turns out that my management at Bellcore said, "You know, G.P., I saw this guy, Gerry Alphonse, who, he might have something that might be useful."  So, my management was just pointing me in the right direction.  He said, "You know, go take a look."  And so I did.  And I said, "Gee, this thing actually might be useful."  So, I remember getting in my car one day, you know, taking the outer drive over to Princeton.  And I called Gerry, "Hey, Gerry, this is what I want to do." Blah, blah, blah.  I hadn't met him all at.  I didn't even know him.  So he said, "Well, come by, let's talk."  So I went by.  I made a little presentation, and I remember a little of the, you know, the Sarnoff management was there. And they said, "Okay, you know, this is fine, you know.  This has nothing to do with our main core of business.  You know, give the guy some chips.  And if he's successful, just include our names on paper.  It'll be great for everybody.  And if it doesn't work, we've lost nothing, just a few chips."  And so, Gerry gave me a few chips, I took them back, I started working with them.  And within like a week, I started to see some initial indications that these devices were going to be the right ones that would make it work.  And so, that was probably, that happened within the first nine months.  I remember I was getting those results around--I started Bellcore in October, and I was getting those results in June.  And by August, I had the results of my first scientific paper.  So, within a year, I had the results for my first scientific paper.  And then by January, I had made some other improvements by including new types of semiconductors as part of the cavity that would help make the pulses shorter.  That happened within the first ten days of January.  That was going to be a year-end goal.  I remember submitting my things that I wanted to accomplish for the year.  That was going to be a year-end result, if I could get this thing to work.  And within the first ten days, it started working.  I was like, "Wow, that's great, and everything else is gravy from now."  And I just continued to work and work and work.  And by the time, I think, March or April had come, I had sort of--I had broken the world record.  I was very, very, happy--very, very happy.
Story_ID: 27177
Speaker 1: You patented the device that generated this ultra short light pulse, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  So, we, you know, I have thirty-five patents now.  And my very first patent was this patent related to the generation of white light.  Now, it wasn't the white light generation process that was patented, because that had been patented before, by my advisor.  What I had discovered was that if you take a very, very--you know, sort of long--an optical pulse which might be 30 picoseconds, 30 trillionths of a second long--and generate this white light, and then filter past the white light to a filter to select only a certain portion or color of it, that the resultant pulse produced could be orders of magnitude shorter.  And that was a new effect that no one had ever seen before.  And we thought that was a new way to be able to generate short bursts of light.  And it turns out, it was that particular effect which allowed me to use that technique to generate all the vibrational modes, and monitor their lifetimes in real time.  It was that sort of fundamental physical effect that allowed that to happen.  So, that was patented.  With respect to being at Bellcore [Bell Communications Research, Red Bank, New Jersey], I developed several patents, in terms of how you can generate these short bursts of light from semiconductor lasers, this laser pointer technology.  And I think by the time I had left Bellcore, I probably had maybe, maybe another four patents under the belt.  So, I had one as a graduate student, and possibly another four when I was at Bellcore.  I have to kind of take a look at the record, but something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, so what was the use of this, of your short pulse?
Speaker 2: So, the short pulses, you know, have a variety of applications.  Some people are using short pulse technology in communicating.  One of the things that we were really, really proud of--and this was back in the very, very early '90s [1990s].  And it was noted as one of the most important optics breakthroughs in the nineties--was our ability to use these semiconductor lasers, you know, as a light source, that would ultimately replace the clock inside your computer, or a super computer, or a laptop.  And so, in the conventional computing system, you know, you have your integrated circuits, which are all sort of kept in time by a master clock.  For example, your laptop may have a clock speed of one gigahertz, two gigahertz, three gigahertz, of clock speed.  And it turns out that it's very difficult to generate an electrical square wave and pass it through wires and distribute it through many different locations, and to be able to recover that clock's signal at different points within the computer and have that clock signal still look clean in terms of fast, sharp-rising edges, without it being distorted, and without the clock signals experiencing cross-talk amongst themselves.  So, we came up with the idea that, gee, if we could replace the electrical clock by putting optical fibers in it and having fibers deliver optical signals to different parts of the board, and use our mode lock laser which produces these extremely short bursts of light with extremely good timing, that we would basically solve the clock distribution problem.  And that, we patented.  And that garnered a lot of visibility in 'The New York Times,' 'The Wall Street Journal,' 'The Washington Post,' 'Popular Science.'  You know, there were sixty different news articles that covered that result, in addition to the scientific journals and the conferences we went to.
Speaker 1: So, would I be right in assuming that the shorter the pulse, the more accurate?
Speaker 2: And so, well, what happened is that with light, you can propagate light to the optical fiber, and the light pulse will not sort of spread.  That effect we call dispersion.  Whereas, an electrical signal, when you--because the different sine waves which make up that square wave electrical signal extend literally from DC [direct current], all the way to the clock rate and beyond, each one of those sine--electrical sine waves--propagates at a different speed down the electrical cable.  So, you start off with a nice square wave.  And your transistors want to see a sharp edge, because when the voltage is off, the transistor is supposed to be off.  And when the voltage goes high, the transistor knows it's supposed to switch.  But when the voltage changes slowly as it would be on a distorted clock signal, as the voltage is changing, it's not--some transistors may switch at this voltage, some may switch at this voltage, some may switch at that voltage.  Then all the transistors start switching at different times, and this is not good for any kind of computing application.  So, you want that transition between off and on to be so fast that it looks like all the transistors are switching and firing at the same time.  So, the way to do that is to--not to use the electrical signal which will get 'storted, distorted as it gets to its location, but to use optical fibers, and use a light signal to get the light to where it needs to be.  And then when the light is where it's supposed to be, you can use a simple photo detector to convert the light signal to an electronic signal.  And there, the electronic signals are right there where they need to be, and don't need to propagate and won't get distorted.  So, that was the key reason why light would work better.  We eliminate dispersion, we eliminate impedance smashing, we eliminate cross-talk.  Those are the important things.  And the accuracy of our clock could be so much better than the electronic clock signal, too.
Story_ID: 27178
Speaker 1: We did that work [developed the optical clock solution], I think in 1990 or 1991.  So, the patent has come and gone.  But I know the clock, the optical clock solution, is on the roadmap for IBM and Intel.  Because I was at a conference once, and I had one of the VP's--this was maybe seven or eight years ago.  And the guy at IBM was showing the roadmap, you know, of things that they wanted to do to make things faster.  And as you know, right now the clock speeds of most laptops, you know, once they hit three gigahertz--you know, three gigahertz clock speeds have been around for seven, eight years already.  And they haven't, it hasn't gone anywhere.  Because they know in order to go beyond that, they have to radically change, have to radically change the architecture.  And I think the computer manufacturers are just trying to milk as much as they can out of the current investment.  And so, basically, when you ask them, "You know, what's next?" They say "Well, the only way--the next thing we have to do is we have to go to photonics to solve the clock distribution problem."  And then he shows this paper, this reference.  "And there was a researcher a long time ago that showed how to use mode locked semiconductor lasers to solve the clock distribution problem."
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, I'm just sitting there in the front room.  And so, he finishes the talk.  And the moderator gets up and says, "You know, that was a great talk.  By the way, the inventor of the clock distribution problem is sitting right here in the front row."  (laughter).  So, it was very, very nice to see.  But, but I do recognize that many times the technologies that we invent are just sometimes so far in the future that it takes decades to be implemented.  We're just so far ahead.  Another classic example.  Back in 1992, I think, I came up with the idea of using one of our lasers that emits many, many different colors.  Instead of having a compact disc, which just reflects one color of light where you can read the ones and zeroes, if you can have a laser that emits, you know, three or four or eight or ten or sixteen colors, we could adjust the optics where each color could be focused at a different depth.  And if we could make each layer reflective at a different wave length, now, when we shine the beam of light, instead of just reading out a single one with a zero at one location, we could read out, you know, a one or a zero from a red color, or from an orange color, from a green or blue, an indigo and a violet.  So, with one spot--instead of reading out one bit--I could read out, you know, 8, 16, 32 bits at one point.  And that would dramatically increase the data storage capacity of a standard compact optical disc.  So, we proposed and patented that back, again, in 1991, which is, you know, twenty-five years ago, of which the patent is completely run out.  And I know there've been technologies that have been looked, have looked at, the multilayer, the multilayer compact disc.
Speaker 2: So, your patent only lasts--
Speaker 1: The patent only lasts seventeen years.
Speaker 2: Seventeen years.
Speaker 1: Seventeen years.  It's not to give you exclusive rights forever and ever, amen.  But what it gives you is rights to basically try to capitalize on your research investment for a period of time, so you can recoup the money that you have invested in making that discovery, and earn some profit.  But at some point and time, the patent is not there, as a way to prevent other people from getting into the area.  Because the country wants everyone to be competitive.  So, a patent is not to lock people out, but it's to protect the inventor, or to encourage people to make investments.  Because you're not going to want to make an investment to discover something and then have the next day someone look over your shoulder, copy it, and run to market with it.  Because then, you know, no one's going to make the investment.  So, if you make the investment and make the discovery and patent it, then you've got seventeen years to do the best job you can, if you want, you know, to get it to market, you know, make devices, sell it, etc., so you can get your money back and make a profit.  But at some point, you have to let everybody participate and use it.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  I have a question about patents.  Yeah, how much does it cost to patent a--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  To file a patent, a round number is between five and ten thousand dollars, is what it costs to file a patent.
Speaker 2: So, it's expensive.  And in your case, was Bell filing--
Speaker 1: And so--and so, in my case, yeah, for sure.  Bellcore pays all the patent costs.  And their costs could be, you know, much more than that, because within industry, they have patent attorneys on staff.  They're employees, they are employees.  And these guys are good.  These guys are very good, because generally, they have Ph.D.'s in physics or electrical engineering.  And so these guys are sharp.  I'm very, very happy to work with the patent attorneys in the Bell System.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  So--
Speaker 1: The cost is the same here at the University [of Central Florida, Orlando, Florida], five or ten K [thousand dollars].  But then, you know, we use patent attorneys that we hire.  And so, they, they sort of freelance.  I wouldn't necessarily say they're staff people at the university.
Story_ID: 27179
Speaker 1: So you were at Bellcore [Bell Communications Research, Red Bank, New Jersey] through 1992?
Speaker 2: Three.  I was there from 1988 to 1993.  And I left in late October, 1993 and joined the faculty here November 1--well, November 30.  So, I was, yeah, so I was, yeah, exactly.  November 30, 1993, I joined UCF [University of Central Florida, Orlando, Florida].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did you basically while at Bellcore, just improve upon the ultra fast--?
Speaker 2: And so, I basically, again, sort of broke records for world's shortest and most powerful pulse semiconductor lasers.  I then used those short optical pulses to look at photon electron interactions and semiconductor media to see how highly excited electron whole pairs would move around, and discovered some interesting non-linearities that would limit the performance of some of these devices.  I then worked on novel ways in which you could compensate for the pulse spreading that would occur as a pulse would propagate to an optical fiber, with some other colleagues.  And we could show how this novel dispersion compensation technique could be utilized with semiconductor lasers.  We have the patent on that.  I then, you know, used the mode locked lasers for the optical clock distribution problem.  And then we also did the discovery of using multiple colors for the multilayer compact optical discs.  So, those were kind of like the main, my main contributions to the knowledge base of science while at Bellcore.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  So, how did you come to join the CREOL [Center for Research and Education in Optics and Lasers] Lab here at the University of Central Florida?
Speaker 2: Sure.  So, when I was a graduate student, I noticed that they just started this research facility here at UCF.  And I mean, I knew that one day--I'd always wanted to be a faculty, because I like to teach and I like sort of the, the creative way of just being able to explore.  And, you know, they had an optics institute in Arizona [University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona] and one in Rochester [University of Rochester, Rochester, New York].  And I thought it would be really nice if I could somehow one day be part of an academic institution which focused on optics.  And so, when I was much younger, perhaps, I think twenty, when I was a junior in college, I went to Bermuda for vacation.  And I saw how wonderful the beaches looked, and the palm trees and the colorful flowers.  And I came back and I said, where in the U.S. might even remotely look like this?  And then you become aware that, gee, Bermuda's off the coast of North Carolina.  Florida's much further south.  So, if any place looks like that, it's probably Florida.  So, I said one day if I had an opportunity to be able to be in a nice, you know, warm environment, you know, with lots of sunshine and something that has a slight subtropical feel--and to be able to do lasers--I would jump at that.  And so, as a grad student, I saw the creation of CREOL at UCF.  And after spending five years at Bellcore, when I was thinking about taking an academic position, I said, let me see if they would like to have me as part of the faculty there.  And it all worked out.
Speaker 1: Now this is--this is the same year you won a Black Engineer of the Year Award.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: In 1993.
Speaker 2: That's exactly correct.
Speaker 1: And well, this is for your work at Bellcore, right?
Speaker 2: That's correct.  That was for my work at Bellcore.  I won that award in I think the 'Most Promising Engineer' category.  Prior to that, I had won YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] Black Achiever's Award in New Jersey.  But I did win the Black Engineer of the Year Award in the 'Most Promising Engineer' category.  I think that was in February of 1993.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's exactly correct.  And that was a tremendous honor.  And you know, you go to Baltimore [Maryland] in the Convention Center.  And it's a true honor to have been identified as someone who has been able to make a contribution.  And you take a look at all of the other, you know, people that have truly gone well beyond you.  And to have someone select you, to say, you know, we believe that you're on the path to be someone like this, it was a true honor.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  So, the position--you heard about this position here at Central Florida.  And were you attracted by the name?  I know we mentioned the name before, the CREOL Lab.
Speaker 2: Right.  No, I mean I think it was simply because it was a, it was an optics and academic research activity that was focused specifically on optics.  You know, if I were to have taken a faculty position in a conventional electrical engineering or physics department, I'd basically be, you know, one or two people out of thirty or forty or fifty, doing lasers.  If I came here, I'd be a part of a faculty of, you know, twenty-five or thirty, where everyone is doing optics.  And that, I thought, was so great, because I'd have so many other people to be able to talk to, to be able to share ideas, and hopefully have cross-fertilization of interesting ideas.  And that was something very exciting for me.  I didn't want to be a researcher, you know, sort of off, off in the corner by myself, where there'd only be one or two faculty that I could sort of talk to or collaborate with.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Who was the chair here when you--
Speaker 2: And so at the time, M.J. Swallow was the director.  He was the other fellow who happens to be from Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was the first director, yeah.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: He's now the vice president of research, the VP for research and commercialization, here at UCF.
Story_ID: 27180
Speaker 1: How was your, I guess, your time split here [University of Central Florida, Orlando, Florida], in terms of research and teaching responsibilities?
Speaker 2: Sure.  And so, every faculty--we teach graduate courses.  Or at least when I first came to CREOL [Center for Research and Education in Optics and Lasers], it was primarily an academic institution and research institution that focused on graduate training and education.  So, all faculty teach graduate level courses in the area of optics, and we're all expected to do research.  We're expected to go out and hustle for contracts and grants, of which from that money we then pay the graduate students' salaries, their tuition.  We use the money to buy the equipment to allow us to do the job.  So we're like standard faculty in most other departments.  We have to teach, we have to do research, and we have service.  Your service duties are either related to the department and/or college, and your professional service as a scientist with professional societies, etc.  So, we're like just like normal faculty--teaching, research and service.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, what have been some of your research projects here at [University of Central Florida, Orlando, Florida]--?
Speaker 2: So here, what I've done is I've tried to build a research group with a vision that if we want to make an impact on areas of application-- that what I wanted my philosophy to be is not what I'll call, device push-- like "Oh, here's a device, I think you need to use it."  Well, like I'm pushing it on you.  I prefer to have the application pull philosophy, meaning that let's take a look at what applications are out there that need some kind of advance.  And then see if our research can play a role and allow our research to be pulled in that direction, so that if we're successful in our research, we can make some headway in that application.  And so with that in mind, I've tried to divide my research area up into three groups--what I'll call sort of the fundamental physics--where we like to use, you know, short pulses of light and see how they interact with matter.  That's the fundamental physics.  We do that in semiconductors.  And what we try and look for are new physics, so we can perhaps see new effects.  So, we can then use that knowledge and then go into the clean room and make devices which can exploit these interesting effects, so these devices will have new functions.  So, I study physics based upon the new things that we learn.  We go up step up into the clean room.  We fabricate new devices which are going to exploit those physics.  So, these new devices will exhibit new functionalities.  And with these new functions, I then take these devices that can show you functions, and I apply it in systems.  And the systems are related to its communication and signal processing, making the internet go faster, etc.  And when I see these new systems work faster, I say, "Great, we're successful."  We patent along the way, we write papers, we give talks.  And then once we do that, we say, "Okay, great, we solved that problem.  What's the next problem?"  And then we go back down and study new physics, to make more devices to make better impacts.  So, instead of this thing being vertically integrated, I like to sort of say we're cyclically integrated between fundamental physics, devices and systems.  And at each level there needs to be good communication back and forth between the fundamental physics and the systems area, between the systems and device area, and between the physics and device area.  So, everybody knows what they're doing, and talking to each other so we can all learn from each other and push the overall vision of photonics forward.  That's sort of my philosophy.  That's how I do it.  And again, we've made impacts in the area related towards secure communications, compact laser systems that are useful for material processing or drilling holes in walls, making lasers operate with more precision in atomic clocks, etc.
Story_ID: 27181
Speaker 1: What have been your major sources, I guess, of--
Speaker 2: Funding?
Speaker 1: Yeah, funding for your research.
Speaker 2: Sure.  When I first came here [University of Central Florida, Orlando, Florida] I sta-- my most of my funding was coming from the National Science Foundation, and I received a Research Initiation Award.  And I believe I received a, some type of an equipment grant.  I forget what they call it.  But then right after that, I received the Presidential Early Career Award for Science and Engineers--scientists and engineers--called PECASE.  And that was, that is a prestigious award.  While the money comes from the National Science Foundation, it's awarded through the White House.  And so which, you know, which is why it's called the Presidential Award.  And I, you know, this was sort of the top award I'd ever received.  And that was such an honor to get that.  It's given to twenty young scientists every year, you know, from the National Science Foundation part.  And so, to be grouped in such a small group of people, you know, to receive that honor--  and it was a half-million dollars worth of research money, by the way.  So, that's always very nice.  But to receive that kind of an award, was very, very nice.  And it's interesting to note that one of the other guys that was in that class of twenty was Eric Cornell, who won the Nobel Prize a few years ago.  So, I was in a pretty reasonable group of people.
Speaker 1: I would say so, yeah.
Speaker 2: Now, have you been involved in--I imagine you have, since you've been involved with the black physicists.  Have you been involved in mentoring activities while you--?
Speaker 1: Sure.  Sure, sure, sure.  So, obviously, you know, I try to mentor students all over.  I was, I used to help run the 'Introduction to Engineering' program here at UCF [University of Central Florida, Orlando, Florida], which was a program which we started early in the summer, where we'd have all of the incoming engineering students come to UCF before they started in August.  And I would be one of the faculty that would serve as mentors and teach them areas about--teach them things about the engineering profession, and try and get them on the right path before they started the normal engineering curriculum in August.  So, I would do things like that.  I would go out to the local high schools.  You have the people from under-represented groups come into your research experience for undergraduate's program, which was sponsored by the NSF [National Science Foundation].  They would come and work in my laboratory.  So, there's lots of, you know, mentoring, mentoring activity that I've been involved in over the years.
Story_ID: 27182
Speaker 1: I have a note here that your ultimate goal is to invent an ultra fast device that can send 5 billion telephone calls simultaneously through one simple fiber optic glass wire.
Speaker 2: Sure, that's exactly correct.  And as a matter of fact, with the amounts of data rates that we're generating right now, the performance of the lasers are able to do this.  Right now, I have a laser that can produce 600 different colors.  And each color can potentially blink on and off at 10 billion times a second.  And if I do the math right, there's about 7 1/2 trillion bits of information per second.  And I have to do the math in terms of how many.  But that winds up being about 50 billion telephone calls in a single optical fiber.  That's a lot.  And so, that's more than the number of people on earth.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  So, this is--
Speaker 2: But the thing is, how about this?  You might say, "Well, what the heck are you going to do with that?  You know, everyone's going to not communicate through one glass optical fiber."  But let me just put some numbers to it, very simply.  You know, we all have a laptop.  And when your laptop runs at, let's say a one gigahertz clock speed and you connect it to the internet, and let's say you're just using dial-up.  Dial-up speed is 56 kilobits per second, 58 kilobits per second.  So, your computer is running at a billion times per second.  You're talking to the internet at 58,000 bits of information per second.  Your computer is running 17,000 times faster than what it's talking to the internet.  So it's like your computer is saying, you know, counting--one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  When it gets to 17,000 it says, wait a second, that one we send to the internet.  Then it starts all over--one, two, three, four.  And that one goes to the internet.  Now, if you ask anybody, you know-- "Gee, how many have downloaded--you know, movies or music or whatever--and you click to download, and you see the little sand dial.  And the thing is spinning, and it's taking it and downloading it--you know, let me get a cup of coffee.  And you come back and it's still doing it's thing.  How many of you would just like to hit the button, and boom, have it show up?"  Everyone says, "Yes!"  So I said, "Great, guess what?  In order for that to happen, your computer must talk to the internet at the rate at which your computer is operating"--one gigabit per second, a billion bits of information per second--two billion bits of information per second.  As an example.  So now, let's stop and think about that for a minute.  Right here at UCF, we have 60,000 students, like a little community.  And if everyone has their laptop open, wanting to run these applications where we can get on and off the internet, at the rate at which your computer is meant to operate at, we need information.  We need basically one billion bits of information times 60,000.  So, that means we need switching and handling capability of 60, 60 trillion bits of information per second.  And my little laser of, you know--let's say 6 terabits per second, is 10 times too slow.  So, the 50 billion people talking in an optical fiber seems useless, but that speed is not good enough for the applications that everybody wants to have.  And that's to have their computer talking to the internet at the rate it's meant to operate.  We all want to have these 3-D [three-dimensional] virtual reality rooms.  You come in--and the ceiling, the walls and the floor--you know, poof, it's like we're on the beach.  And we see the ocean, we see the, you know, the thatch huts and, you know--well, that's sort of like this Star Trek Holodeck.  You can do that.  But in order to do that, the information handling capabilities of the internet are going to be so far beyond what we have today.  But those are the things that people envision and would like to have.  And so, 50 billion phone calls in an optical fiber--yeah, that's pretty cool, and it doesn't sound useful, but believe it or not, that speed is not good enough for what we want to have for the future.
Speaker 1: But that future is within our grasp, right?
Speaker 2: That future is within our grasp, oh yeah.  I mean, how about this?  I was doing another little interview.  It might be around ten years ago.  And someone was saying, you know, "Tell me something that's going to be in the future."  So, I said, well, I said "Of course.  How about this?  You're going to be able to just, you know, think about a person--and poof, they're going to magically appear in front of your eyes."  And they said, "How in the hell, how is that going to happen?"  I said, "Well, envision this.  Here's what's going to happen.  You're going to be having some glasses on.  And what's going to happen, there's going to be a little camera that's going to you know, looking at the reflection of your eyeball.  And your eyeball is going to, let's say, move down to the corner of your glass lens.  And it's going to, you know, look on the little--either the Microsoft Windows icon--and a pop-- There's going to be a menu that's going to pop up.  Your eye is going to scroll up.  It's going to look at your phone list.  You're going to blink your eye, you know.  The phone list is going to drop down.  There's like--on your, on your display on your glasses--you're going to scroll down.  You're going to look for your mom's name.  You're going to blink your eye, and then there's going to be a video call.  It's going to be established.  And so, then she's going to have this image projected right on the reflective parts of your glasses."  And so, when I say it like that, this is now exactly what Google has come out with.  But that was ten years ago, and people were saying, wow, that's fantastic.  And I said, no, that's not fantastic, we can actually do that today.  And so, here it is ten years later, these things are now starting to come out on the market.  So, when you say that we have these interesting visions--but there's a classic example, where, yeah, these things really are, really are in our grasp.  And that's one I wanted to point out.
Story_ID: 27183
Speaker 1: Give us one more example of what the future holds.
Speaker 2: Right.  And so, I'd mentioned the concept of the Google glasses.  Again, I was talking with another interviewer about ten years ago, where I sort of told them that that was possible, and it's very nice to see that today.  The other one I briefly mentioned was the idea of something like the holodeck.  I believe that that is really, really possible.  But not just with respect to having the walls and ceilings and floors be basically made of like a large TV display.  Those displays are inherently two-dimensional.  So, I don't care--you know, it's like--it's like a big picture.  The picture doesn't change when you look at it.  What I'm talking about is having the walls, ceilings and floors being like a real time three-dimensional display.  Meaning that if I look at that wall--and from this angle--and I see a tree, and there's a person behind the tree which I can't see, that if I were to move in the room through a different angle, I'd be able to see behind that tree.  And so that would be a true, like, holographic display.  And I believe that that is possible inside a closed room.  So, literally, your environment would literally be a true virtual reality environment.  It would be completely--you would not know you are somewhere else.  And so, it would literally be like you're sitting somewhere else.
Speaker 1: So, like the holodeck concept.
Speaker 2: Exactly like the holodeck.
Speaker 1: --in 'Star Trek--
Speaker 2: In Star Trek.
Speaker 1: The Next Generation.'
Speaker 2: That's exactly--and I believe--
Speaker 1: And I thought I'd say that out, for people who don't know what Star Trek--
Speaker 2: That is--the holodeck...  And we see--how about this?  For you and I, the holodeck and Star Trek: Next Generation seems like a few years ago.  There might be some young folks out there who might see this...  "Well, 'Star Trek: the Next Generation'?  What the heck is that?  That was so many years ago."  For us, it's like, seems like yesterday.  But you're absolutely right.  That's exactly the vision.  And I really believe that we actually have that technology.  It still needs to be developed.  And it still needs to come along.  But I believe stuff like that is possible.  And I believe that's something, that's where things are going.  That's where meeting spaces are going to be.  So the next time, you know, we get together for a sit-down chat, instead of being in this room, maybe we'll be in, you know, one of UCF's [University of Central Florida, Orlando, Florida]  holodeck rooms.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we'll make it around the beach scene, or whatever it is you wish.
Speaker 1: Now, the implication is that this technology also has implications for training--medical training--
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: Military training, you know.
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: Lots of different--
Speaker 2: That is correct.  I mean, that's the beauty of virtual reality.  It means that you can put yourself in an environment for learning, training, experiencing--whatever it is--without any of the costs, challenges, or hazards of any of those actual environments.  And that is the beauty of it.  I mean, obviously, if you could make this--make this holodeck thing a reality, obviously, you know, entertainment (laughter), you know, clearly comes into play.  You know, you could see, you know, virtual reality spaces at Disney [World, Lake Buena Vista, Florida] or Universal [Orlando Resort, Orlando, Florida] for sure.  But some of the more important, real applicable ones, would be things for like military training, if there is a need for that.  But other types of training--perhaps even for training for astronauts in space, without doing it necessarily inside of a pool.  For weightlessness, you could combine the effects of weightlessness in a pool combined with a virtual reality environment.  So, it literally would give you the full three-dimensional space look without you knowing you're actually in a pool.  I mean there are, you know--the applications are only limited by our own creativity.  And so, while you and I are just kind of coming off with a couple of interesting activities or applications right here as we sit, there are probably many more which we haven't even thought about.  But we just have to have maybe another cup of coffee and think about it a little more, and we'd come up with a full list.
Speaker 1: We were talking to Dr. John Rossen this morning about surgery, you know, at the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --noninvasive surgery, and--
Speaker 2: that's correct.
Speaker 1: --using video for that, you know.
Speaker 2: That is exactly correct.  That is correct.  Things like non-invasive surgery become extremely important, just with respect to the ability to provide good medical services and healing without the trauma that your body experiences by opening it up.  And so, all of these virtual reality environments become important tools for those applications.
Story_ID: 27184
Speaker 1: What's your latest patent?
Speaker 2: So, the latest patent--we're trying to come up with technology that will replace the large conventional electronic computing facilities that Google uses for search engines.  And so, we're trying to make this thing small.  It has the potential to about the size of a desktop computer.  It has the potential to process or search for information on the order of, you know, 10 trillion bits of information per second.  And it would require a very small amount of consumed power, maybe on the order of, you know, less than a hundred watts, for sure.  And so, when you take a look at some of the Google data farms, you know, these things are buildings with racks and racks and racks of computers.  And not only that, but they have a small power plant built outside the building to provide the power to run the computers.  Two percent of all the energy that is produced in the country is used to power up, you know, Google data farms, as an example.  And so, if we have the ability to come up the technology--and in our case we're going to be using light to be able to do searches--match filtering, we call it.  We'll be able to do it faster with a smaller footprint and the consumption of less power.  So, it'll be greener technology and more cost effective, better for the environment.  And perhaps these hardware--these-  hardware for search engine technologies--could be proliferated all over, instead of having them conglomerated in main locations.  So, we believe that would be very, very neat.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, I said I'd ask you about some of the organizations you're a member of.  And maybe before I do that--I know you just came back from a trip to--
Speaker 2: I was in Germany, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you travel a lot in regards to your research?
Speaker 2: Yes, I travel a lot.  Primarily, whenever I travel in the U.S., there are, you know, kind of like three main reasons why I travel.  One is to go to Washington, D.C. to ask for money.  The second reason is to fly back to Washington, D.C. to show what I did with the money (laughter).  And third, to go around the country to share my scientific results with other scientists and grad students and researchers in the country in terms of what we've been able to do, with the hopes that they can also learn from what we've done, and apply some of our knowledge to their own experiments, to push everyone's, you know, forefront of knowledge further.
Story_ID: 27185
Speaker 1: In terms of funds, how much have you been able to generate, you know, for your research, since--?
Speaker 2: And so, I believe over the twenty years I've been at UCF [University of Central Florida, Orlando, Florida], between research grants for my own group and research contracts that I've gotten together with other people, I think I've brought in a little over $20 million, on that order, round numbers.  Maybe it could be 18, maybe it's 23--but somewhere around there, around $20 million dollars. Which is, I'm happy with that.
Speaker 1: And so the University is happy.
Speaker 2: The University, yeah, the University is pleased.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They'll keep me another day.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Just joking.  They--the University loves me, and they tell me that.  And I am very honored to be here.  To give you an indication, the University just had its commencement recently.  And they asked me to provide the commencement speech.  And it's the first time in forty years that they've used one of their own faculty to give the commencement speech.  And so, the provost called and asked me, you know, would I be willing to do this.  And the first thing I'm thinking to myself, "Why is he asking me?  I thought they asked famous people to do this."  But they said that they always wanted someone from the faculty, and they thought that I would be a very, very good person.  So, they were--so, we had five commencement speeches this May, because our school is so big.  I gave the one in the morning.  [President] Bill Clinton gave the one in the afternoon.  So, I'd like to say I was the opening act for President Clinton.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In 2003, I know we opened up--you told us what your position was.  But in 2003, that's when the University Board of--you were appointed--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: University Board of Trustee Chair--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Professor of Optics--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Engineering and Physics, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.  And so, that is a, that means I have an endowed chair.  And so, generally the way the ranks of professor go is you come in as an assistant professor.  Your next level up is an associate professor.  And the top rank is full professor.  And for a very select few fortunate faculty which have shown high levels of activity and success in terms of research, teaching and service, many universities will have an additional position, which will be these endowed chairs where there's some amount of money that's put away somewhere in a bank.  And the interest that's earned off of that endowment, that interest then goes to the professor to then use to help support graduate students and further his research.  So, that was, the University awarded me a trustee chair.  And I think in 2001, I also received the Pegasus Medal, which is the highest honor the University gives.  So, I'm very pleased and happy to be here at UCF.  I work hard, and it's just a great place to be.  Fantastic students, and just really, really, hardworking faculty.  And everyone who's working here really has a keen vision, and desire to make UCF, you know, a truly research intensive, you know, world-ranked institution.
Speaker 1: Now, from 2001, the University had like $2 1/2 million to train thirty Ph.D. students, I think, and--  Is the university still, like, training Ph.D. students in optics, optic communications?
Speaker 2: So, yes.  So, we had I think an IGERT Program, which stands for Integrative Graduate Engineering Research Traineeship, I believe is what the acronym stands for.  And so, I was one of four faculty who we teamed together to bring this money in from NSF [National Science Foundation] to specifically train students in the area of fiber optic communication.  And so there, we had well-designed courses which are still now a part of our curricula, again, with faculty from computer science.  And we built up a test bed, or a laboratory, where students could develop devices in their own research programs, and then apply them on a network test bed to show how these devices would work in the overall optic communication network.  And so, that has in fact improved and increased our visibility in the area of fiber optic communications nationwide, and has improved our research visibility in fiber optic communications.  So, we're still bringing in graduate students from all areas of optics.  We have about twenty-five faculty here working in the areas of, you know--imaging, fiber optics, high powered lasers, non-linear optics and spectroscopy, signal processing, etc.
Speaker 1: Are you able to attract minority students?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.  I'm not sure what the percentage is, but we can easily go the CREOL [Center for Research and Education in Optics and Lasers] board, which shows the student body.  And we have an extremely healthy number of folks from underrepresented groups, both women and minorities.  And so, we're very, very happy and proud to be able to have that here at UCF and CREOL.
Speaker 1: Now, are you the only African American faculty member here?
Speaker 2: Well, Jim Moharam, who's Egyptian, you know, he says he's African.  So, (laughter) that's another colleague of mine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so, but as far as the classical sense of African American, yes, I'm the only one here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have several women on the faculty, two women on the faculty.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now I've heard that even in the historically black colleges and universities, there aren't as many black faculty as in the hard sciences.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Story_ID: 27186
Speaker 1: Now, you're a fellow of IEEE [Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers].
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm--
Speaker 1: This really means something, too.  I found out, I mean when you're a fellow, it doesn't mean that you're a member, you're--
Speaker 2: Right, right, yeah.  I think to be selected at the rank of fellow you have to have shown--demonstrated significant contributions to the knowledge base of your professional area.  And not only have--not only do you need to have shown significant contributions, there is only a limited number of fellows that are allowed to exist.  Meaning that, I think it's one-tenth of 1 percent of the total membership is allowed to be fellows.  So, even if you've done great work, there's only a limited number of slots that can be occupied.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, yeah.  This is, being a fellow of IEEE or OSA [The Optical Society] or APS [American Physical Society], these are all significant honors.  It takes many, many years of sustained research contribution, which is not just--yeah, I mean it's not like yourself saying, "Oh, I think I did great, you know, elect me fellow."  No.  I mean, you have to be elected and voted on by other people who think your contributions are significant enough.  And that's where the honor really comes into play.  Because we all know and love how--I'm sure we all can imagine or think about how good we think our own work is.  But in reality it's more important, and much better for me, when my colleagues think I've done a good job.
Speaker 1: And you're a fellow of the American Physical Society, as well? And--
Speaker 2: Yes, and the Optical Society, as well.
Speaker 1: Optical Society, and the African Scientific Institute?
Speaker 2: Yes, and ASI, that's correct.
Speaker 1: And president, former president of the National Society of Black Physicists?
Speaker 2: That's correct.  I was president of NSBP from 2008 to 2012, and I'm currently finishing up my term as past president.
Speaker 1: Finishing up your term as past president?  (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right.  (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I think you become president-elect, and then president.  The normal term is, is two terms.  And then you serve one year as past president.  So, a full term should be something like four years.  So, I served--but I did two terms.  And so I think I, I think I started as president-elect in 2007.  And so, I've done more than a year as past president.  I was asked to stay on an extra six months.  So, when all is said and done, I will have done from 2007 to 2013--I will have done six and a half years, seven years, something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it's a great organization.  And one of our main things is to, is to hold a conference where we raise money from the National Science Foundation to bring African American students in the areas of physics and engineering to our professional conference to give them an opportunity to not only see the research of, and to network with professionals, but so they have an opportunity to present their own research results.  And so, this gives them an idea to build up excitement about why they're doing research, and to see that there are other people like themselves really out there in the research community doing work.  It gives them a chance to network.  And it hopefully gives us an opportunity for them to continue to stay on a track for research as a career.
Story_ID: 27187
Speaker 1: What advice would you give African American students--
Speaker 2: Right--
Speaker 1: --in particular about, you know, your field of laser and optics and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Sure.  I'll give them some advice that they can take, independent of what field they're in.  And we would always like to believe that people we meet will always like us.  But no matter who we are, we will always meet people that, for whatever reason, may not like us.  And that is independent of what color your skin is.  And so, if we, unfortunately, have to interact with some people which may not be as broadminded as we are--they may still have, you know, thoughts and concepts and perspectives which could be, you know, a few decades old.  And they think that our ability is somewhat limited in the areas of science and engineering.  To that, I say, you know, what we really must do is to work extra hard.  We have to not just show that we're good.  My whole concept and my philosophy always has been to be better--to be better, and to really demonstrate that.  And that way, no one can really argue with the quality of my research, you know.  That was one of the, another reason why I got into research.  I was a little naive, thinking that, "Oh gee, in research--there is no politics involved in science.  You know, one plus one is two all over the world.  So, a great research result is a great research result."  And in some sense, that is true.  And so, and so with that, you know, yeah, there's politics everywhere.  But, but the concept is if you work hard and really show that you are better, then, then they have to accept you, at least as being equal, right.  So, I hope that's not tough advice, but it is something that I have sort of, sort of subscribed to.  My philosophy has been, you know, learn to play by the rules, but learn the rules so well that you can, you can play with your colleagues at a level beyond what they can play.  Always do your best, always strive to be better.  Shoot for the stars, because if you fall short, you're still in orbit.  Because when you aim low, the only thing you get is shot in the foot.  And that's not good.  So, these are some of the philosophies that I live by.  No, you can't control what happens around you, but you can control how you react to that.  Always work hard.

Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point in your career--you still have some time to go.  What today would you consider to be your professional legacy?
Speaker 2: My professional legacy.  Um, that's a hard question.  There's a couple of things which come to mind.  One on hand, you would--there's a part of you which would like to believe that you could make some sort of scientific contribution that you could--people could point to, you know, years, decades, hundreds of years later.  "Oh, see that thing.  The way that works, yeah, that was done by, you know, Peter Delfyett."  That's one perspective.  On the other hand, a little bit more realistically:  You know, I'd like people to remember me--or a legacy--I would like to have been able to touch the lives of many, like my students that come out.  To have given them an opportunity, you know, to be able to go on and do great things.  Because my advisor gave me a chance to have an opportunity to do great things.  And I would like to be able to do that, to share with that.  And when I'm--and when my day is done--if people would just look back and say, you know, "That guy was really nice.  He was a smart guy, he worked hard, he treated people like he wanted to be treated, you know.  And oh, by the way, he did some darn good science, too."  That would be great.  I'd be happy, you know.  I just want to be remembered as a nice guy whose heart was in the right place.  That's--you know, I don't want much more than that.
Story_ID: 27189
Speaker 1: If you look back over the course of what you've done, is there anything that you would do differently if you could go back and change something?
Speaker 2: That's another hard question.  Because when you're confronted with difficult challenges in your life where it always looks like it's the darkest, somehow at the end of the day, you wind up on the other side.  Or, it forces you in a direction, or guides you, in a direction that you may not have taken.  And to say, would you do it differently?  Hard to know.  If I had done it differently, I might not have ended up where I am today.  And so, I don't believe there has been any sort of, what I'll call critical or disastrous mistake I've made.  Have there been challenges?  Oh, sure.  Have there been tough times?  Oh, sure.  Have there been times when you want to pull your hair out and scream and, you know, have a temper tantrum?  Sure.  But I think all those things have made me a better person.  And they've all kind of guided me down the path to, where at the end of the day, when I looked back and said, "You know if it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here."
Story_ID: 27190
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your family.  Are you married now?
Speaker 2: So, I, you know, I was married for seventeen years.  And I'm no longer married.  Perhaps my extremely hard, you know, work ethic might have had something to contribute to that.  But, I'm divorced now for seven years.  No children.
Speaker 1: No children, okay.
Speaker 2: No children, yeah.  And I'd make a great dad, too, because in my heart I'm still a big kid.  And kids, young kids, just like me, because I relate to kids the way kids want to be related to.  And I think that's a thing that I think some adults sort of miss.  But you know, when you see a kid, and the kid could still be wearing diapers.  But if you get down on your knees and you roll around and crawl around on the floor, the kid says, "Oh, gee, this is another kid.  He just happens to be a little bit bigger than me."  And so, I think--so there the message is, know your audience.  (laughter).  And so, I think I get along famously with kids.
Speaker 1: Do you have nieces and nephews?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I've got four nieces and nephews.  My oldest nephew just graduated from Temple [University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], and he's now working in an advertising agency.  The next one is finishing up a degree, a combined degree in engineering computer science and arts, at University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  My next nephew is at Lehigh doing a degree in mechanical engineering.  And my niece is at Wheaton [College, Wheaton, Illinois] on a full scholarship, and I think she's going into international studies or business.   She's just finishing, I think, her first year.  So, those are my four nieces and nephews.  They're all doing well.  I'm very proud of them.
Speaker 1: Are your parents still alive?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my dad's [Peter John Delfyett Sr.] still alive.  He's turning, turning seventy-five on Father's Day this year.  And so, since this is taped and it won't be seen for awhile, it's probably okay that I said that we're going to say we're throwing him a surprise party.  So, hopefully, I'm not letting the cat out of the bag here. (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's great.
Speaker 2: So, yeah, that'll be great.  So, I'll be flying into New York in an-- at the end of next week.
Story_ID: 27191
Speaker 1: Now, do you still drum?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I do.  I still drum.  I don't do that as often.  But the other hobby I have, I do Salsa dancing.  That was something I took up in 2007.  And I think, again, because I was playing drums back in the mid to late 70's, that's when Salsa music was becoming quite popular in New York.  And being a percussionist, a lot of Salsa music has its rhythms from, you know, Afro-Cuban rhythms.  And so, me being a percussionist, I started to become involved in listening to Salsa music and Mambo music, Latin style music.  And so, fast forward, in 2007, I, you know, I saw some people doing Salsa and it sort of reminded me of New York Style Hustle.  And I was saying to myself, "Gee, I think I can do that, but I would just need someone to teach me."  And so, one of my laser colleagues said, "You know, you can take lessons for that."  And I had no idea that you could do something like.  And so, I looked on the internet, and I found a place.  I started taking Salsa lessons, and I started getting pretty good.  And they said, "Hey, you know, your timing is real good."  Probably because I'm a drummer, and I'm, you know, my musicality and timing is very good.  He said, "Why don't you try out for the junior performing team?"  And so I did, I made it.  And I made it to the semipro team.  And so, that's something that I do now.  And we'll fly around the country and perform.  We performed at the New York Yankees Tampa Bay Rays baseball game, and the Orlando Magic half-time.  We've performed at big Salsa events, you know--in Washington, D.C. and Atlanta--you know, all over the state of Florida.  So, that's a hobby.  It's great exercise.  I mean just super exercise.  I mean, really, really good cardio.  And you have to lift the women, and flip them and drop them.  So, it keeps you in shape.
Story_ID: 27192
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything that I haven't asked you about that we need to discuss before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: That's always a good question.  Because when I'm going to buy something big I always ask, "Are there any questions that I haven't asked that I should have asked?"   (laughter).  And so, I guess that's what this is.  And I can't think of anything right now.  But so, go ahead, shoot your last one.
Speaker 1: Alright.  The last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: How would I like to be remembered?  Okay, and so, I will, I will answer that similarly to the legacy question.  I think I would like people to look back and say, you know, "Professor Delfyett--Peter, Dr. D."--whatever you call me, you know, "That guy was really nice.  He really cared about the students.  He really wanted the students to do the best.  He really did some nice work.  He was a damn good Salsa dancer and drummer."  (laughter).  Something like that.  But again, you know, I just want people to see me for who I am.  I'm just a regular guy, born and raised in New York City [New York], from Queens.  Just a regular guy, a Ph.D. from the New York City Public School system.  I want to be able to show folks that, you know, that you too can come out of a public school education and make it all the way to the top and beyond.  You know, don't limit yourself with boundaries.  You know, treat people right.  You know, have their best interests at heart.  Because I find with my students--when I have their best interests at heart, and show them that I really do, they really step up to the plate and work hard.  And if we all did that as a society, the world would be a great place to live.  The world would be--it's already a great place to live in.  It would be a better place to live in.
