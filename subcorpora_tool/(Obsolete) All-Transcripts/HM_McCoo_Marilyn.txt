Speaker 1: Marilyn was a combination of Mary and Ellen.  My mother's name was Mary Ellen Holloway.  McCoo is my real last name.  People thought I'd made it up.  I said how can one concoct a name like McCoo (laughter)?
Speaker 2: It sounds sort of cute, and that's what people probably are referring to.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But is there, is there, do you have a story about what kind of a name it is?  I guess it would be Scottish or, or--
Speaker 1: The only story that I have about the name McCoo is I don't know where it came from.  I asked my father [Wayman McCoo].  He said our last name should have been Daniels, but it was McCoo.  So I guess that was the slave master's name.  And I don't know with (laughter), I don't know where the, where the plantation was.

Speaker 2: All right--
Story_ID: 171987
Speaker 1: Okay, now before we go, go into depth, there are five lightweight questions that we always ask that only require a short answer.  The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: A favorite food, I like grits.  I love grits.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's one of my favorite foods.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't really--I, I was thinking about the colors.  I have a number of favorite colors.  I like green; I like gold; I wear a lot of black and a lot of white.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I like spring, and I like fall.
Speaker 1: Okay--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Summer and winter are too extreme for me (laughter).
Speaker 1: A favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Well, I've always enjoyed going to Paris.  It's such a lovely, lovely city.  I haven't been there in a while--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but I've always enjoyed visiting there.
Speaker 1: And the last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Well, one of my favorite sayings is, it's a scripture; it's: "Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding.  In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will direct your path" [Proverbs 3:5-6].  And I lean on that scripture over and over again, especially when, when I'm in the middle of something, and I really can't understand what's going on.
Story_ID: 171988
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --your father's side, but we'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name was Mary Ellen Holloway McCoo, M-A-R-Y, E-L-L-E-N, H-O-L-L-O-W-A-Y, M-C capital C-O-O.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born on January 14th, 1913, in Charleston, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what can you tell us about the ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back can you trace her side, and what were, what were they doing, or what's, what's the story?
Speaker 2: Well, let see, the farthest I can go back is like in the 1700s.  One of my ancestors arrived in Charleston, South Carolina from the State of Maryland, and he was a sailor I believe.  And he ended up liking Charleston and decided to stay there.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And so what happens one, one, once he stays?
Speaker 2: Well, that was in the 1700s, and then my mother was born in 1913, and she was--they were still in Charleston South Carolina.  And then at the age of two, my parents and my grandparents moved to Jersey City, New Jersey with their family.  And they began--they were part of the beginning of the migration of the family from, from Charleston to, to New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so is there, is there any stories of, of slavery on, on, on your mother's side of the family, or were they free in Charleston or, 'cause there were some free black people--
Speaker 2: I believe that my, my mother's side of the family was free.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I've never done a long search on my family's history on my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Is there any stories about what they were doing during the Civil War or, or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --after emancipation or anything like that?
Speaker 2: (Shaking her head no).
Speaker 1: Any organizational affiliations that they had in Charleston that--
Speaker 2: (Shaking her head no).
Speaker 1: --come to mind?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry no, I don't--
Story_ID: 171989
Speaker 1: And did your grandparents [William Holloway and Leticia Campbell Holloway] have a chance to go to school in--
Speaker 2: Well, I'm not sure about my grandparents going to school.  My grandfather ended up being a Pullman porter, which was considered quite a--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --a special job for, for a black man back in the, you know, back in the early 1900s and the late--well, let me see, my mother [Mary Ellen Holloway McCoo] was born in 1913.  Okay, so, so in the early 1900s that was considered a very special job.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when your mother was thirteen your grandfather moved the, the family to--
Speaker 2: When she was two.
Speaker 1: Two, okay.
Speaker 2: She was born in 1913.
Speaker 1: Okay--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And yeah--
Speaker 1: Yeah, all right--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --at the age of two they moved to New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, so, so his career as a Pullman porter was mostly in New Jersey, you say?
Speaker 2: It might have been.
Speaker 1: Okay, so now your mother, what did say about growing up in new, New Jersey?
Speaker 2: Well, she, it, it was basically what she remembered and what she knew.  And she, she lived there until she moved away to go to Meharry Medical College, Medical School in, in Nashville [Tennessee].  So she, she lived in, she lived in Jersey City [New Jersey], with to school there.  She went to Hunter College in, in [New York City] New York and got her, got her bachelor's degree there before she went to medical school.
Speaker 1: Did her, did she have siblings that went to college as well, or--
Speaker 2: She had two brothers.  Both of them ended up becoming lawyers.  And she had a sister, and her sister became a teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay, so is there any, so, you'd have to think that her parents were really into education.
Speaker 2: Very much so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very much so, yeah.
Speaker 1: So if they didn't go to school themselves, which you, you don't know, but they certainly pushed their children.
Speaker 2: They made sure that their children did, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my mother's oldest brother, Willie Holloway, he, he, he passed the, the bar in New Jersey with one of the highest scores that had ever been scored.  The, the family did talk about that.  They were quite proud of that.
Speaker 1: Okay, and where did he go to law school--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But your mother went to Hunter College [New York City, New York] and then, then to--
Speaker 2: And then went to--
Speaker 1: --Meharry.
Speaker 2: -Meharry Medical School [Meharry Medical College, Nashville Tennessee], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so, now did, did she talk about why she wanted to be a doctor or you know, or, or what it was like trying to be a doctor and be a woman--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --in those days?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, she talked about that.  Well, one thing, my mother, my mother did tell me that at one time she wanted to become an actress.  And her father said no daughter of mine I gonna become an actress (laughter), so but he was okay with her going to medical school.  But of course, you know, that was a, a difficult thing for a, for, financially to handle, but, but grandpa did it.  And my sister always tells a story about my mother loving, loving medicine so much that (laughter) she and a friend of hers used to find cats.  And they, they killed a couple of them and then opened them up to see what was inside, what made tick.  I said ah, interesting but no thank you (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother was really passionate about medicine.  And when she went to, when she went to Meharry, one of the things that she ran into was, you know, there weren't very many women in medical school at that time.  And some of her professors--(unclear)--thought that any women that were medical school had come there to marry a doctor.  And my mother used to get so angry when she'd talk about it.  She said I could have thought of an easier way to marry a doctor than to go to medical school (laughter).  And she knew that she was going to have to score very highly to be considered, you know, to be taken seriously, and she did.  She did very well.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, did she talk about any particular mentors that she had or teachers that, you know, encouraged her?
Speaker 2: I never remembered her speaking about anyone in particular.
Speaker 1: Or any, any doctors that were role models for her, you know, that she--
Speaker 2: There was a woman by the name of Lena Edwards, Dr. Lena, Lena Edwards.  She was an, she was an OB/GYN, an obstetrician and gynecologist, in New Jersey, and she did inspire my mother to become a doctor.  As a matter of fact, she inspired my mother so much that even though we lived in Columbus, Georgia, every time my mother would get ready to deliver one of her children, she would trav--she would take the train from Columbus, Georgia, up to Jersey City, New Jersey.  And that's where each one of us, my sisters and my brother and I, were born.  We were all born in Jersey City, New Jersey, and Dr. Edwards delivered each one of us.
Speaker 1: Okay, that, so that's an interesting story.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I'm glad I asked that question.
Speaker 2: I'm glad you did too.
Speaker 1: --Right.
Story_ID: 171990
Speaker 1: I'm sure that name [Dr. Lena Edwards] is probably in this archive someplace else, you know, 'cause people like that usually inspire--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --multiple people.  So, well, let me go to your father's side.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Wayman, W-A-Y-M-A-N, Glenn, G-L-E-N-N, McCoo, M-C capital C-O-O.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born May 9th, 1909, in Eufaula, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Okay and, and what, what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side?
Speaker 2: Well, my grandfather [Thomas McCoo], my father's father, was a doctor.  And his mother [Anna Coffee McCoo], who we called mother, was four years old when the Emancipation Proclamation was signed.  And, that's right, and, and mother went on to become a teacher.  And we don't know where she went to school.  We don't know if she went to, she--it was a result of one of the Freedman's school arrangements or what.  We know that she went to a normal, she graduated from a normal school and taught school.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And daddy was an only child.  And he ended up following in his father's footsteps and became a doctor.
Speaker 1: Now did his father--I didn't ask this about your mother either: did, what, did your grandfather have a specialty or was he a general practitioner?
Speaker 2: He was general practitioner.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother was a general practitioner when she first went into medicine.  She ended up going into anesthesiology, and then she became, she ended up going into public health.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father started out as a general practitioner and thought he would go into anesthesiology as well, like my mother had, but he didn't like it.  So he stayed in general practice, which became family practice years later.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Now, now, where did your father--where did your grandfather get his medical degree?  Did, did he go to Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] too?
Speaker 2: He went to a school called Leonard Medical Center [later Leonard Hall, Raleigh, North Carolina], which ended up being the first, the first school I believe for African-American students to become doctors.
Speaker 1: And where was Leonard Medical Center?
Speaker 2: Oh gosh, North Carolina I think.  I think it was in North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's at least a good--you know, right, we'll keep, make, make note of it.  Anybody doing--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --research on this, they can probably find--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Leonard spelled the way you'd normally spell Leonard?
Speaker 2: L-E-O-N-A-R-D, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right.  And so, so your father goes to Meharry too, right?
Speaker 2: He and my mother met at Meharry (laughter), and my mother married a doctor (laughter).
Story_ID: 171991
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Now the interesting, your father [Wayman McCoo] was a singer before he went to, or, or before he--
Speaker 1: Well, my father always--
Speaker 2: --became a doctor.
Speaker 1: --wanted to sing, and I think that's where I got my passion for music from, from him.  I mean he was always very supportive of everything I did.  And before he went away to medical school, after he graduated from Talladega, he and two other guys got together.  They called themselves the Jones Boys.  And the Jones Boys--the, the two guys that he sang with were the Jones brothers, and they called themselves the Jones Boys.  And they, they left Alabama, and went up to New York, and they sang with the Fletcher Henderson Orchestra.
Speaker 2: Now this--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: This is high cotton, or as they say, this is, this is big time.
Speaker 1: Right, yes.
Speaker 2: He's singing with Fletcher Henderson
Speaker 1: He's, they sang with Fletcher Henderson--
Speaker 2: That's--
Speaker 1: --for a couple of years.  Daddy was very proud of that.  He used to talk about when they would sing 'Trees.'  They would sing 'Trees' as their last number and "oh, the people would just cheer and--
Speaker 2: How does, how does 'Trees' go?
Speaker 1: [Singing] "I think that I shall never see a poem lovely as a tree," that one.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  So, yeah, when, when you're with Fletcher Henderson, that's, that's really big time stuff.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So your father was a professional singer--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --be, you know, before he became a doctor?
Speaker 1: And daddy continued to sing most of his life.
Speaker 2: So did he sing--what venues did he sing in, once he got--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Oh, now that, I'm sorry, I, I don't know all the places they sang.
Speaker 2: I mean, well, I, I'm just saying--
Speaker 1: I never, I never asked him actually.
Speaker 2: --what, what, did, did he sing mostly in church or did he sing in the secular world, or how did--
Speaker 1: In the secular world.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So did, did he sing with big bands--
Speaker 1: Basically, he sang--
Speaker 2: --like--
Speaker 1: --with Fletcher Henderson.  I don't know--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --who else they might have sung with.  I think during, I think during that time that singers would become associated with a band, and they would go out and work with them.
Speaker 2: And so, even as a doctor he would, he would sometimes sing with Fletcher Henderson--
Speaker 1: Oh no, no, no.
Speaker 2: That's, that's all I was--
Speaker 1: No, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what I meant.
Speaker 1: After daddy became a doctor, then he sang, he sang just for joy.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He just enjoyed singing, yeah.
Speaker 2: Did he have a good voice?
Speaker 1: He had a wonderful voice.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: All right, I just wanted to hear you say it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 171992
Speaker 1: Now is there a story about how your parents [Wayman McCoo and Mary Ellen Holloway McCoo] met?  They're both at Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee], I, I reckon around the same time.
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly.  Do you know, I don't know how they met?  But they met, and they fell in love.  And my mother was planning on graduating as Mary Ellen Holloway, but she ended up graduating as Mary Ellen Holloway McCoo.  Her father [William Holloway] wasn't too happy about that (laughter).  I mean he wasn't, he wasn't unhappy that they got married, but he thought I've paid all this money for you to go to medical school, and you're gonna graduate with somebody else's last name (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, well, this is--so, you know the year they graduated?
Speaker 2: Nineteen thirty-eight [1938].
Speaker 1: Nineteen thirty-eight [1938], okay.  This is before World War II.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So they graduate, and they, did they, did they go to Georgia immediately after graduation?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure, but they ended up moving to Columbus, Georgia.  Daddy's family, daddy's mother and father [Anna Coffee McCoo and Thomas McCoo] were living in Eufaula, Alabama, which was right across the, the state line between Georgia and Alabama.  But my mother and father ended up settling in Columbus, Georgia.
Story_ID: 171993
Speaker 1: Did you, is there a story behind, you know, why they [McCoo's parents, Mary Ellen Holloway McCoo and Wayman McCoo] settled in Columbus, Georgia?  Was it because your, your father's from Eufaula [Alabama]?  Is that, that the reason they--
Speaker 2: That I think had a lot to do with it.  And I think that daddy wanted to probably--I don't, I don't know, you know.  I don't know if he wanted to just get situated in a, in his own town.  And his father, his father [Thomas McCoo] was quite well known in Eufaula.  As a matter of fact, they, when my father passed away--and, and daddy is buried in, in Eufaula--and we went down and took his body down there.  Oh, my gosh, the mayor of Eufaula just spoke so highly of my grandfather, because during the time of the, of them integrating Eufaula, they said that my, my grandfather was very, very important in helping the integration process to happen without violence.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that, there's a story of black doctors in the South, you know, take, you know, taking, going out of their way to, you know, push civil rights.
Speaker 2: Well, I have a, I had a, a godfather who was actually murdered because of his civil rights work in Columbus, Georgia.  His name was Thomas Brewer.
Speaker 1: Is, is there--can, can you tell us the story?  Do, do, do you know what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, we had moved out to Los Angeles [California] by the time he was, by the time he was shot.  And I just remember that my parents were extremely upset when we got the news.  And he was, he was a very brave man, and he fought, he fought.
Story_ID: 171994
Speaker 1: Now you have two parents [Mary Ellen Holloway McCoo and Wayman McCoo] who are physicians.  When you think about their attitudes, their sense of humor, how they walked, how they talked, what they looked like, their talents, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I look like my father.  I think I, I take after both of them.  I think I'm more like my mother, but I do have a lot of my father in me.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what aspects, or what about the aspects of your personality?  Are they--
Speaker 2: I, you know, I, I don't, I don't, I, I'm like both of them I think.  I can think of ways that I'm more like my father.  My father was hotheaded (laughter).  I tend to be that way, I've been told (laughter).  And I don't know.  I just, I have--my, my, my husband tells me that I have a lot of my mother in me.  And so when I think about that, talking to you right now it's not coming to me why he says that, but, but I'm sure that there are good reasons for it.
Story_ID: 171995
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so, so do you have siblings?  You have--
Speaker 2: I have two sisters.
Speaker 1: Two, okay.
Speaker 2: And I ha, I had a brother.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you name them in their birth order and including yourself in the order, and tell us a little bit about them.
Speaker 2: Okay.  My older sister's name is Glenda McCoo Wina.  Did you want me to spell that or does it matter?
Speaker 1: Sure, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, G-L-E-N-D-A, M-C capital C-O-O, W-I-N-A.  Then my, my--I was second, and then my younger sister is Mildred, M-I-L-D-R-E-D, Camuriel, C-A-M-U-R-I-E-L, McCoo, M-C capital C-O-O.
Speaker 1: Is there a story behind that, her middle name?
Speaker 2: Yes, Camuriel was, was the name of a woman who, who my parents help put through school.  And she used to, she took care of us, as my mother was practicing medicine, and you know, both parents were away from the home.  And Camuriel was there taking care of us, and my mother and father put her through school as she was helping them with us.  And then my brother's name was Wayman Glenn McCoo, Jr.
Speaker 1: Okay, and he's passed?
Speaker 2: He's passed away, yeah.
Speaker 1: But your sisters are still--
Speaker 2: My sisters are still alive, yes.
Speaker 1: And you're the youngest?
Speaker 2: No, I'm the second--
Speaker 1: Oh, you're--(unclear)--okay.
Speaker 2: --second oldest.
Speaker 1: Okay, you're second oldest.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Okay
Story_ID: 171996
Speaker 1: All right.  All right, now, do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Well, I do remember one time when we were riding the train to go from Columbus, Georgia, up to Jersey City, New Jersey to visit my grandparents [Leticia Campbell and William Holloway].  And I remember that we were staying in, in one of the cars where we slept, the Pullman cars.  And they had those, they had the, the ladders where you'd, you know, sleep on the top bunk and the lower bunk.  And I (laughter)--(unclear)--we used to climb up on the, on the ladder and, and hang off like we were the garbage men (laughter).  I remember that.  I remember, I remember New Jersey.  I remember, you know, not exactly where we lived, but I remember that there was a, a playground down at the end of the street.  And I remember one time my Uncle Harold took us to the playground.  And I wanted to get on this, on the, I wanted to get on the sliding board, and he didn't want me to get on it.  But I talked him into letting me get on it, and I fell off of the side and split my finger open (laughter).  I remember the smell of coffee, because my, my grandparents would always have coffee brewing in the house.  And I would always associate the, the smell of coffee with my grandparents' home.  And we had, we had nieces, cousins.  We had cousins in, living in New York [New York City] because my mother's sister, who was a teacher, she lived in New York City, and when we would go up to visit we would see our, we would see our cousins.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And all--they weren't the only cousins we had.  We had other cousins there too.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now you were basically raised in Georgia until you were seven?
Speaker 2: Until I was seven, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It was trips to New Jersey periodically?
Speaker 2: Yes, we went to New Jersey from time to time to visit.  I don't know--you know, one of the times that we went up to New Jersey was probably my mother had to deliver my younger sister [Mildred McCoo], and she had to also deliver my brother [Wayman McCoo, Jr.]. So, we might have, we might have, that might have been one of those trips.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't remember, I don't remember about my mother being pregnant (laughter).
Speaker 1: Those are extended trips, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you'd be, you'd be there for a little while.
Story_ID: 171997
Speaker 1: So did you, I guess you started school in Georgia, right?
Speaker 2: I started school at Mother Mary Mission [School, Columbus, Georgia].  It was a Catholic school.  And my parents [Wayman McCoo and Mary Ellen Holloway McCoo] were the doctors there at the school, and so we were able to, Glenda and I were able to attend a Catholic school.  So our--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --our education began on a, a very high level, which was great.
Speaker 1: Were your parents Catholic?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they were doctors at the school, and so they allowed us to attend.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, and so how did you like school when you started school?
Speaker 2: I don't remember not liking it.  I don't remember a lot about, you know, how I felt about school.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you have any favorite activities in school at that stage?
Speaker 2: I, I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  When, when your, now you're in the second grade I guess when, when you--
Speaker 2: When we moved to California I was, I was going into the third grade.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: And that was because I started school early.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So even though I was turning seven, they allowed me to start the third grade because I was supposed to go into the third grade then.  And so my sister and I were like a year ahead of ourselves.  But coming from the South, they're thinking that we were gonna be behind everybody else.  And so they told my mother that if we couldn't keep up then we would have to be put back, but Glenda and I did fine.  We, we had been in a Catholic school, and, and actually the, the, the classes were beyond the grades in Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 1: Now did, did you learn how to read at home be, before you started school?
Speaker 2: I'm sure I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm sure I did.  I, I, I, you know, again, it's not something that stands out for me, but, but yeah, my mother was teaching us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did your, so your, your parents practiced at the Catholic school that you attended.  Their, their practice was there, correct, at the school?
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm, well, that was one of, that was one of the places.  They also had an office.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They also had an office in Columbus.
Speaker 1: Was--
Speaker 2: They were also the doctors for the Catholic school.
Speaker 1: Okay, was the office in your home like adjoined or, or were they in two separate places?
Speaker 2: They were two separate, two separate places.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.

Speaker 1: So, any, any last thoughts about Georgia?  Any lingering thoughts about Georgia?  Well, what were you thinking, or, or can you remember how you felt I mean leaving Georgia?
Speaker 2: It was just an adventure.  I mean we had friends.  We had kids that were friends of ours, Jimmy Grant and Judith Grant.  Judith Grant ended up writing a book about Columbus, Georgia.  And we have it, and it's just I, I, you know, I look at her now, and I haven't seen her in many, many years.  But when I see her face, it's like, I remember that face.
Speaker 1: That's a--
Speaker 2: And her, her brother, Jimmy, (laughter) he was, he was the first boy I ever kissed.  I think I was a little fast (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you--
Speaker 2: Terrible girl.
Speaker 1: --were you seven yet when you kissed him?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't seven yet.  Isn't that awful?  Terrible girl.  But anyway, (laughter)--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: So, okay, so now we're, we are leaving for new, for, for Los Angeles [California].  And I remember the TWA plane, and they called it a constellation.  And it was, we had to land in, in Texas, and then we had to land again in Los Angeles.
Speaker 1: So what positions were your parents [Mary Ellen Holloway McCoo and Wayman McCoo] coming to Los Angeles to take?  Did they have--I'm sure they already had something--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, my father had already gone out and he had found a location, an office location for, you know, for, for my mother to, to step in and--actually, let's see, how did that work?  Yes, okay, my mother came out with, with us.  Daddy had come out and had checked on a location, and he and my mother had come out to Los Angeles together.  They were trying to decide if we were going to move to Denver [Colorado] or Los Angeles, and they decided Los Angeles was the place.  So they came and found a place where we would stay temporarily.  And then, I don't remember if they had already purchased the house, and we only--I remember the temporary location where we were, but, and then we moved into our home, and we got a place for the doctor's office.  My father stayed in Columbus, Georgia, and continued to practice medicine so that the transition could be as smooth as possible.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so, now what neighborhood did you live in, in Los, or did--
Speaker 2: We lived on 10th Avenue.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was between Washington Boulevard and Adams Boulevard.  And that was before they constructed the 10 Freeway [Interstate-10, I-10], which went through that whole neighborhood and just destroyed the whole area.
Speaker 1: Is there--
Speaker 2: Well, it didn't destroy it, but I mean it just changed the whole personality of the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Well, this is refrain we hear all the time about the building of the interstate and how it was routed through the black business districts sort of all over the country, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It happened in Tulsa, Oklahoma; it happened in my hometown in Dayton [Ohio] and a lot of places they talk about the same thing, urban renewal, you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and all that, the disruption of the mainly the black community 'cause it was politically the weakest one--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --to, you know, so--
Speaker 2: Well, the area, the, the neighborhood that we lived in, I remember that it, that it was kind of mixed, interestingly enough.  It was still predominantly black, but there were some white families.  There were some Latino families.  There was a Japanese family that lived across the street from us, and we became very friendly with them.  As a matter of fact, I went to school with one of their daughters.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, how long were you there before the 10 came through?
Speaker 2: Maybe just about seven years.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were in high school I guess or just, you know, starting high school, or were, were you in the, you were, you were in the middle high school I guess when the 10 came through.  I guess you'd have been fourteen--
Speaker 2: No, by the ta, let's see, by the time the 10 came through, well, I don't remember when, when the 10 was finished.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you all had--
Speaker 2: But I know that--
Speaker 1: --moved before--
Speaker 2: --in 1958--
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: --we moved.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, so yeah, so you're about fifteen when, when you all moved, but--
Speaker 2: No, actually, let's see--yeah, you're right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 171999
Speaker 1: We always ask this question, and I, I guess we can include, you know, Georgia in this scenario too, but what were some of the sights, and sounds, and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Crickets, Georgia, the smell of, of the humidity of the summer, I remember that.  It's funny, I remember more about those things in Georgia than I do about Los Angeles [California], because Los Angeles, I don't know.  But of course, Los Angeles is where I ended up growing up.  I don't--I remember learning directions in Los Angeles and of course the ocean, because we were no longer landlocked.  And we used to go to the beach all the time, and that I associated with growing up, roller skating, you know.  I removed--when I was in junior high school, I used to love to--when they would have, they would have talent shows and things and I would, I would want to be part of the talent shows, or if they were gonna do a play, I wanted to be part of those things.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--well, when you were seven and you moved out here, did you--did Los Angeles have a mystique for you at seven.  I mean, you know, it's Hollywood, and you got Disneyland and all that.  But, I mean, did, did you have a sense of that when you came out?
Speaker 2: You know what I found fascinating about Los Angeles, when we were living in Columbus, Georgia, the schools were segregated.  When we started going to elementary school here in Los Angeles there were white kids at my school.  The only association that I had really had with white kids was when we were down in, in, in Alabama and we would go visit my grandparents [Anna Coffee McCoo and Thomas McCoo].  There were some kids that lived not far away, and we used to throw rocks at one another.  And don't ask me why; we just did, you know. And if somebody would say well, why are you throwing rocks at them?  We'd probably say because their throwing rocks at us, you know.  But, but by the time I got into school in Los Angeles, the kids in the classroom, we just all got along.  We, you know, we became friends, and it was, it was new, but it was okay.
Story_ID: 172000
Speaker 1: I read that you always interested in, been interested in show business.  So when did this first manifest itself?  Well, I guess always.  I, I don't know.  I mean, do you have any stories about when you first started thinking about yourself as being an entertainer at some point?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, when I was growing up, my father [Wayman McCoo] would come home sometimes with, with vocal arrangements, usually something from, from a book, because daddy at one time taught, taught choir at, at his church.  He would come in with a vocal arrangement, and he would start assigning parts.  And my mother [Mary Ellen Holloway McCoo] would sing her part; and my sister, Glenda, would sing her part; and then they'd give me a part to sing, and then we'd all four sing in harmony.  And I loved it; I loved the sound of harmony.  And we'd get around the piano, and daddy would plunk out the parts and, and play the, you know, play the chords.  And I just loved that they included me in it because I was thinking I'm just one.  And then they would marvel because I could, I could hold my note.  And they'd say well, listen to her.  She's holding her note.  And I would think, well, of course I'm holding my note.  That's what you told me to sing (laughter).  It never occurred to me that it was unusual.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I just, I just enjoyed music from very on.  And then my, my, my parents made sure that we studied piano lessons, that we took piano lessons.  All four of us did.  And they just wanted us to have, you know, a familiarity with, with music.  My mother had studied violin when she was in, when she was growing up, and so they wanted us to have, to have a knowledge of music.
Story_ID: 172001
Speaker 1: Now was church a big factor in growing up in terms of, well, just period I guess?
Speaker 2: Well, we did go to church, not every week.  That--my mother [Mary Ellen Holloway McCoo] belonged to a Presbyterian church in Los Angeles [California].  My father [Wayman McCoo] belonged to a Methodist church in Los Angeles.
Speaker 1: Now they didn't--is there a reason why they didn't go to church together?
Speaker 2: Do you know I never ask them.  I never asked them why, you know, why it was that way.  And perhaps, you know, I don't know if it was when we first moved out, and my father was still in, in Columbus [Georgia], that maybe my mother found the, it was Westminster Presbyterian Church on Jefferson Boulevard.  And she might have started us going there, and then when daddy came out, he, he might have said well, I was always a Methodist.  I don't know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not--
Speaker 2: I don't really know.
Speaker 1: I mean it's not like it, it doesn't happen.  I've, I've heard this, you know, before, but I, I just wondered, 'cause he was, you know, different.
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: I mean it's, it's, it's not the usual thing.
Speaker 2: It is--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --a little different, isn't?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So we did go to, we did go to church from time to time.  We'd, you know, go for all of the obvious days, you know, like Easter and things like that.  And then in between we would go, but we didn't go every Sunday.
Speaker 1: Did you go to your mother's church mostly or--
Speaker 2: Most of the time, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And when I was in junior high school, by that time daddy was in L.A. [Los Angeles, California]. And then daddy was, he was, he was teaching--he was part of the, the choir of, at, at his church.  And Glenda and I used to go and, and sing in the choir there.  I think it was probably a children's choir.
Speaker 1: So, what a minute.  So, so your mother was in Los Angeles first--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --before your father--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --joined you?  Okay, so, how long was she here before--
Speaker 2: Before daddy ended up?  I don't know how long it was.  It might have been two years.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I, I'm, I'm not sure about that.
Story_ID: 172002
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, so your father [Wayman McCoo] was singing and still in, in church though in--right?
Speaker 2: He was, he was singing.  And also my parents [Wayman McCoo and Mary Ellen Holloway McCoo] joined this, this organization called the Medical, Dental, and Pharmaceutical Association.  And it was, it was an, it was an organization of, of black doctors, dentists, doctors and dentists, medical, dental, and pharmacists.  And they would, once a year they would put on talent shows to raise money.  You know, they'd sell the tickets to their, to their patients.  And, and the people would come and, and watch the doctors, and the dentists and their kids, and the pharmacists perform.  And they would take that money, and they would use it for scholarships for, for aspiring young medical students.  And so, I remember when I, I guess I was about twelve, and my whole family performed, and oh, I loved that.  I was just in seventh heaven.
Speaker 1: Okay, what as the repertoire, you know, of your family in those days--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Um, let's see, my father used to sing 'On the Street Where You Live' and I remember, that, we sang together.  It was a (singing) mama, dear, come over here and see who's looking in my window.  It's the butcher boy, and oh, he's got a bundle in his hand.  Tell me why he winks his eye whenever he goes by my window.  And then our parents would say daughter, daughter, he's in love, and you're in love, and love is grand (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so, that, that was part of on the street where, where you were at--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: That was another song, that.  That was a song--
Speaker 1: Oh, I thought it was, oh, I thought it was--
Speaker 2: That was a song I--
Speaker 1: --like a lead in to the other--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: --no, no, no, no, that was one song that we sang together and then daddy would come out later, and he would sing his solo on 'On the Street Where You Live.'
Speaker 1: Okay, now, was, was there a lot of music played at, at home on the radio or the--
Speaker 2: Oh yes, oh, all the time.
Speaker 1: --phonograph.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What were your parents' favorite music, or what was your favorite music I guess?
Speaker 2: Well, I learned to, let's see, I remember a lot of Frank Sinatra.  I remember a lot of Ella Fitzgerald and Lena Horne.  And daddy, daddy loved Louis Armstrong, Nat King Cole, gosh--just some of the names that come to mind.
Story_ID: 172003
Speaker 1: Okay, so, well, let me, I'mma pick up back on that in a minute.  But, but what was the name of your Los Angeles [California] school? Where, where did you start elementary school?
Speaker 2: I started at Arlington Heights Elementary School [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Okay, and that was in third grade, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, you have doctors for parents [Mary Ellen Holloway McCoo and Wayman McCoo], and, and everybody in the family is accomplished and everything.  Were you a good student in school too?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I, I, I, I think so.  I, I mean for the most part.  I don't remember the grades.  I, I mean my mother wouldn't tolerate us not bringing home good grades.  If, if we didn't bring home good grades, we would hear about it.  So, I don't, you know, I don't remember bringing home straight A's.  I used to always (laughter), I would always have problems with my, with my cooperation grades (laughter).
Speaker 1: Why?  What were--
Speaker 2: Not the, not the grades for, for the actual subject but how I was behaving in class.
Speaker 1: Oh, that little box that says gets along well with others and that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, or, or, you know, is she, is she talking too much (laughter)?  I wasn't lippy to my cla, to my teachers, but they were always telling me to be quiet.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you liked to talk to the other students.  Okay--
Speaker 2: I guess so (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did, did, did your parent, did either parent or both of 'em kind of push you towards medicine at all, or, or I mean, mean thinking about becoming a doctor?
Speaker 2: Do you know that my parents never tried to make any of us go into medicine, and none of us went into medicine.  They knew that I wanted to, that I was leaning towards music.  And my two sisters were both avid, avid readers, and they--but I don't, I don't where that was supposed to take them.  My, my younger sister [Mildred McCoo] ended up in, in the Foreign Service.  And my older sister [Glenda McCoo Wina] ended up as a journalist.  And she ended up in journalism on television here in Los Angeles [California], and she ended up being a medical reporter, interestingly, enough.
Speaker 1: So they both had like a broad education.
Speaker 2: Very--
Speaker 1: I mean well, I guess you did too--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --very, very broad.
Speaker 1: --a broad education at home--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 172004
Speaker 1: Were you encouraged as a, as a singer, as youth?  I mean did, were you recognized that, did they recognize your talent early on?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, my father [Wayman McCoo], because he knew that I wanted to become a singer, he decided that I should start studying.  So I started studying voice, I started taking voice lessons when I was in junior high school [Mount Vernon Junior High School, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Okay, so were they in the neighborhood, or did you have to go downtown or what?
Speaker 2: The weren't that far away--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --not at that time.
Speaker 1: You remember your voice teacher?
Speaker 2: I don't remember my voice teacher when I was in junior high school.  I remember my voice teacher when I was in college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: In junior high school you don't remember what was it?
Speaker 2: No, no, I, I remember her face.  I don't remember her name right now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So did, did they encourage you?  I mean did, did your voice teacher encourage you to--
Speaker 2: Not--
Speaker 1: --keep--
Speaker 2: --you mean the one--
Speaker 1: --singing?
Speaker 2: --in, the one in junior high school?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--yeah, they, they said hey, you got, really go some talent or did they say well--
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't remember that too well.  But my father had a dear friend who was a vocal coach.  He and he and Eddie Beal became very good friends.  As a matter of fact, Eddie Beal was like his best friend.  And Eddie Beal ended up becoming my mentor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he really worked with me, and encouraged me, and taught me so much of what I know today.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about Eddie Beal.  Was he a professional singer or, or, or, or musician--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: He was a professional vocal coach.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, and when did you meet him in your--
Speaker 2: I must have met Eddie when I was maybe about fourteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: About that time maybe or sooner, maybe, maybe, maybe before then.  Maybe Eddie came into our lives in--you know, now that I think about when we did that, that performance for the medi, Medical, Dental, and Pharmaceutical Association, Eddie might have been, I think Eddie was involved in that, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: Because he helped put the, he helped put the show together, and he worked with the different families and the musical presentations that they did.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you must have met him at least by the time you were twelve--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I might have met him at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, and so, you had--where'd you go to middle school?  Was it, was it a--
Speaker 2: Mount Vernon Junior High School.
Speaker 1: Okay, Mount Vernon Junior High School.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  And then you went to Dorsey High School [Los Angeles, California], right?
Speaker 2: I went to L.A. High School [Los Angeles High School, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Oh, L.A. High School, and then--
Speaker 2: And then I went to Dorsey High School.
Speaker 1: --then Dorsey, okay.
Speaker 2: It was during the time that I was going to L.A. High that we moved.  That was, it was, that was--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --during the transition period.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, somewhere along this time in, in high school, I guess you're, you're, you're fifteen.  You, you would have been a junior in high school when you met, when you were on the 'Art Linkletter Show,' right?
Speaker 2: I was on the 'Art Linkletter Show' twice.  I was going to--the first time I was on it, Ark Linkletter had a, a show called 'Kids Say the Darndest Things.'  And I was going to a day camp, day camp, summer day camp, and I think I was about ten or eleven at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, that figures, that's, that's, yeah.
Speaker 2: And, and I was on his show then.  I didn't do much of anything, I mean, just talked (laughter).
Speaker 1: Is this where they lined the kids up.  They have 'em sit in their seats, and Art Linkletter goes from one kid to the next--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --and ask them questions.
Speaker 2: And he asks questions.
Speaker 1: And he's, he's astonished (laughter) at their answers.
Speaker 2: Yes, that was, that was the one, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you, you remember what your, your dialogue was with Art Linkletter?
Speaker 2: No, all I remember is they, they told me that, that he was gonna come and talk to me, and then they said be ready with a joke in case he asks you to, to tell a joke, you know.  So I do remember that I was sitting there waiting for him to ask me to tell my joke, and I said I have a joke (laughter).  So he laughed, oh, okay, tell me the joke.  I don't remember what I was.  It was probably something stupid (laughter).
Speaker 1: And, and then, then you encountered him again with, with His talent scouts, that, that what--or, or--
Speaker 2: Yes, he had a show on later called Art, 'Art Linkletter's Talent Scouts,' and I ended up auditioning for that.  And they--and I sang on that one.
Speaker 1: You, you remember what you sang?
Speaker 2: Oh, it might have been either 'The Nearness of You' or 'That's All.'  I used to love the torch songs.  And I--no, or I might have--I, I don't remember what the song was.  I think it was one of those two.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 172005
Speaker 1: All right, so, now you're in high school during the time when, when the nation's music taste starts trending towards rock 'n' roll, you know, Little Richard and Fats Domino and all that and you know, out of the big band era.  It's kind of like--
Speaker 2: Yes, it was--
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: --that transition, yeah.
Speaker 1: It was a kind of transition where there's, there's Broadway show tune-type stuff was on the radio, mostly Frank Sinatra and the, you know, and then, then all of a sudden here's Elvis Presley and--
Speaker 2: And the Beatles and--
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: --well, the, they were later.
Speaker 1: Beatles were much later.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were later, yeah, right.
Speaker 1: But, but, but we're talking like--
Speaker 2: Right, they were later, yeah.
Speaker 1: --Fats Domino--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Little Richard, you know The Drifters, you know, they all they start--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --you know, coming on--the Platters--
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: --and all that, yeah.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: The Flamingos.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, so this, as I remember as a little kid watching this--I wasn't that little, but I was a little young, younger than my brother.  The, you know, I just noticed there's a shift in music; there's a little shift.
Speaker 2: Well, actually, that happened in junior high school for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Frankie Lymon--
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: --came out with 'Why Do Fools Fall in Love' and--
Speaker 1: 'I Wonder, Wonder Who' (laughter), right?
Speaker 2: Oh, who wrote the book of love--
Speaker 1: Wrote the, right, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, un-huh.
Speaker 1: 'Why Do Fools Fall in Love,' yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, that's, that's, those are two different songs.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that's right--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but, yeah, Frankie Lymon and oh, gosh.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  Coasters.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Coasters, that's right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't, I don't remember all the, the groups at that time, but I remember in junior high school that those were out songs, you know, and those are the songs that we identified with, although those, that wasn't the music that we heard at home.  But, but we enjoyed both if it.
Speaker 2: Right, 'cause there was a--
Speaker 1: I enjoyed it.
Speaker 2: --there was a little battle over the radio dial in our house about which kind of music you're gonna hear.  But the, you know, my brother's music won out (laughter).
Speaker 1: Really?  Well, at--
Speaker 2: He was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --time, we didn't, we didn't battle with, with--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --our parents about what kind of music was being played in the house.  When we got home, my mother's music was on, and then when we were, when we were at school, it was the music that we heard at school.  So I just listed to all of it.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, all right.  Did you have any favorite artists at that point in time?
Speaker 1: You know, my, my brain's not working that great today because I'm not remembering all the things that, that I used to listen to.  I know like in high school, like I mentioned the Flamingos and 'Tears on My Pillow.'
Speaker 2: Did you idolize any of the black female vocalists that were popular?  I mean, you know, anybody watching the 'Ed Sullivan Show' in those days would see [Hm] Della Reese [Della Reese-Lett] or Eartha Kitt or you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Oh, Eartha Kitt, oh yes, I mean 'C'est Si Bon' (laughter).  Oh yes, I, I was, I really, really like her. I really liked her a lot.  And then, and then July London came out with a song called 'Cry Me a River.'  Her voice was so sultry and low, and, and it, and it I, identified with the sound of her voice because it sounded like my voice, you know.  And I'm trying to think of some of the other songs.  And again, I always loved the, the sad songs, and--
Speaker 2: What is it about the sad songs?
Speaker 1: I don't know.  I don't know, I just always liked the songs about unrequited love.  I mean I was, I was gravitating towards those things when I was, when I used to listen to Judy Garland, you know, singing about the man that got away and all that.
Speaker 2: Now, now before we started this interview, I was telling you how you could actually make me cry if I, listening to you sing like 'One Less Bell to Answer' for some reason makes me misty, I don't know.  You know, but that's what he said, you, you seem to really internalize the, that emotion.  I mean you're able to hit or resonate with it, you know, in a way.
Speaker 1: You know, nobody knows why they, you know, it's just something that attracts you, appeals to you for whatever reason.  It's something inside.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: Eddie Beal was married to a singer.  Her name was Mary Chappelle.  And I used to love to hear Mary sing, and she sang, she sang sad songs.  And I used, I used to really like to listen to Sarah Vaughan.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I loved the, the, the quality of her voice.  And I used to marvel at how she and Billy Eckstine had a similarity in their sound, and I don't, just, just something that came to mind.
Story_ID: 172006
Speaker 1: Okay, now what kind of activities were you involved in, in [Los Angeles] High School [Los Angeles, California]?  Did you, did, did you run for a class office?  Were you in clubs, or, or did you do, you know, what, what did you do?
Speaker 2: I was, I was, I was in the choir.  My teacher, Rudy Salzer (ph), wow, he just really--I learned so much from him.  He really helped me a lot, just teaching me about commitment and dedication and hard work, because he required that.  Anybody that was in his choir, you were gonna have to be about hard work.  And if you didn't want to come and rehearse before school or sometimes stay after school if we had a performance coming up, he'd, he'd put you out of the choir (laughter).  So, so I learned like, if you're really serious about music, you'd better be serious about it.  And so I was involved in the choir.  I was involved in, in acting.  And there was a, the acting teacher's name was Donald Hurst [ph.], and he, he encouraged me a lot.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, he--I ended up performing in a play at Dorsey High School [Los Angeles, California].  It was the woma-'The Madwoman of Chaillot,' and I was selected to play Countess Aurelia, which was the starring role.  And it was the first time that they had chosen a black actress or a black student to be, to headline or to, to be the star of, of the production, and it was, it was quite an honor.
Story_ID: 172007
Speaker 1: My sisters and I used to sing together.  As a matter of fact, my younger sister, Millie, and I, we used to sing duets together, because we shared a room, and she enjoyed music.  And Glenda enjoyed music; ac, actually Glenda was the best pianist of the three of us.  And, but Millie and I used to sing together, and we would sing together, we would sing together at school.  We'd sing together for the Medical, and Dental, and Pharmaceutical Association events.  We'd sing for anybody who'd sit down.  You'd better not sit down for too long, (laughter) you might have a performance on your hands.  Yeah, Millie and I, we did Everly Brothers' duets because, you know, they were so big.  And sometimes I would get my sister, Millie, and, and maybe Brenda English, who ended up becoming (laughter) a lawyer.  She lived up the street from us.  That's before we moved.  And I would try to, try to get all of us to sing harmony parts, because when I was in elementary school, one time my teacher was trying to teach the class how to sing songs together.  And I started assigning parts to them, and she said oh, oh, you can hear that?  Harmony was always easy for me to hear.  So I'd say well, they can sing this part, and she was like, okay--and then, they can sing this part (laughter).  And so--
Speaker 2: So you understood all that at an early age--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was just, again, it was something that I heard.  And I think that when my father [Wayman McCoo], and my mother [Mary Ellen Holloway McCoo], and Glenda and I were singing those harmony parts, it was just helping to develop my ear.
Speaker 2: Okay, and we mentioned the Platters off-camera too--
Speaker 1: Oh, the Platters, oh, I loved the Platters when, that was when I was in junior high school.  And they had hit after hit after hit, and, and they were great dance numbers (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah and Motown kind of starts up just as I guess when you're in your latter years in high school, right, mo, Motown is--
Speaker 1: Actually, Motown--
Speaker 2: --starting up.
Speaker 1: --Motown started as I was going to college, starting to go to college.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: [HM] Smokey Robinson, and Mary Wells, and-
Story_ID: 172008
Speaker 1: Now, well, so, your senior year in high school [at Dorsey High School Los Angeles, California], what, what were your--you, you were getting ready to go to college.  What, what were your career, you know, aspirations?
Speaker 2: Objection--aspirations?
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly.
Speaker 2: Well, when I was, okay, so now I'm in, I'm singing in high school, and Eddie Beal is involved in my life.  And he's teaching me music, and he's teaching me about interpreting lyrics and making sure that when you sing that your lyrics are understood, because he said you know, you, you've got to make sure that when you're telling a story--he always used to tell me: tell the story.  Don't worry about trying to impress people with how well you can sing.  If you can sing well, they will know it.  You tell them the story.  And so that was a wonderful lesson that he taught me.  And there was a man who came along when I was about fifteen, and he had talked about wanting to record me.  And I was excited: oh, my gosh, I'm getting ready to become a star now.  And of course my parents weren't excited about that, and it, it didn't go anywhere.  But I figured that once I graduated from high school, that I was gonna start with my singing career.  I graduated from high school at sixteen.  My parents [Mary Ellen Holloway McCoo and Wayman McCoo] were not going for any of that, and so I thought, well, I'm gonna start singing now.  And my mother said no, you're not.  You're going to school.  You're going to college.  And I was like, well, why do I, why do I have to go to college if I want to be a singer; I wanna be an actress.  She said you're going to college, so I went to college.  And that was okay too because all during the time that I was--I, I went to UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles California], and all during the time that I was at UCLA, my father had me studying with a woman by the name of Florence Russell.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now you graduated in '60 [1960], is it?
Speaker 2: I graduated in 1960.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, that's what I thought--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --okay, 1960.
Speaker 2: And my father found this, this voice teacher, Florence Russell.  I have a feeling Eddie helped him find her.
Speaker 1: So this is Dorsey High School you graduate from--
Speaker 2: I graduated from Dorsey.
Speaker 1: --in 1960.  I, I--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I'm sorry to interrupt.  I just wanna make that point.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Anybody wat, watching this, they know where we are.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then, and then how did you make the decision to go to UCLA?  Was there, did you have several choices, or was it just more than obvious you were gonna go there, or?
Speaker 2: Well, Glenda went to UCLA.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And since I had to go to, since I had to go to college, and UCLA was a very good college, and I, I took the test, and, and, and they accepted me.  So it was like, well, UCLA was right there at home.  I could drive to school, and Glenda was going there, so I was gonna go there (laughter).  And my mother and father, they were fine with that.
Speaker 1: Did you stay on campus or at home.
Speaker 2: No, I stayed at home.
Story_ID: 172009
Speaker 1: And so I started out in theater arts.  And I started out in theater arts because I was studying music outside of school.  I was studying with Florence Russell, so I had the best of both worlds.  I could study for my acting career at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles California], and then I was studying with Florence Russell for my music career.
Speaker 2: Well, tell us something about Florence Russell.
Speaker 1: She taught, she was more in the classical vein.  And so she started, she started me working in the classical vein.  And so that was fine, because what she was doing was she was strengthening my voice.  And my father [Wayman McCoo] always said that he wanted to make sure that I learned how to sing properly, because it always troubled him that when, when, when there are black singers that were, were working in different projects that it seemed like their voices would get fogged up, that they weren't, they weren't trained well, and that so they would have problems if they were doing theater, if there was, you know, musical, if they were doing any of musical programs on stage.  And daddy wanted to make sure that, that my voice would be strong enough, that I would be able to do the job, do the work.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so--
Speaker 2: Did it make a difference?
Speaker 1: It really did.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It really did.  The, the work that I did all through college worked for me when, when I started singing with The 5th Dimension.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So was this your first exposure to a classical singing regiment?
Speaker 1: Pretty much, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And daddy was studying with her as well.  And so she would have him come in from time to time, and we would sing some duets together.  We would do 'Porgy and Bess,' and that was fun.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, so, so you, did you do any theater at UCLA?
Speaker 1: I, I, yes, we did--let's see, what was it?  It was oh, what was the name of that, that play? [Long pause] I'm blanking on it right now.
Speaker 2: Okay--
Speaker 1: It was, 'Some Enchanted Evening' was from it, and [singing] Some people (unclear)--oh, Bally High.
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: --Bally High.  What was the name of the, the production at Bally--
Speaker 2: Oh, 'South Pacific.'
Speaker 1: 'South Pacific,' thank you.
Speaker 2: 'South Pacific,' right.
Speaker 1: I was, I was part--
Speaker 2: I heard Bally High then I--
Speaker 1: Yes, right.
Speaker 2: --then I knew it.
Speaker 1: I was part of the, the production of 'South Pacific' there, yeah.  That was fun.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I enjoyed that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the--okay, all right, and so--
Speaker 1: I was in the chorus of that.
Story_ID: 172010
Speaker 1: So you, now at, you were a student at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles California] when you ran for Miss--
Speaker 2: The Miss Bronze California--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --Pageant.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was.
Speaker 1: Now tell us about the Miss Bronze California pag, Pageant.  Who was in charge of it, and, and how did it work--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: The Miss Bronze Pal--California Pageant was a pageant for, for young women of color, for African American women to--you know, because there were all these beauty pageants and everything.  And so they had begun this.  I think, gee, I'm, I'm not sure when it started.  It might have started in 1960.  I'm not sure, but I was in, I was involved in the pageant in 1962.  And I wanted to be in that pageant because, again, I was thinking I was gonna be discovered.  I was gonna sing (laughter).  I was always waiting to be discovered.  And, and so I did sing, and they had a, an award that they called the grand, the Miss Grand Talent Award, and I did win that.  So then I thought, okay this is my big break.  It wasn't really, but it was it okay.  And I enjoyed that a lot.  It was fun.
Speaker 1: So, so did you win the whole thing or just the pan, talent, talent portion?
Speaker 2: No, I won the Grand Talent Award.
Speaker 1: Okay, Talent Award, okay.
Speaker 2: I'd won the Grand Talent Award, and, and I, I, you know, I never really entered that pageant to try to win the, the beauty part.  I never really considered that I would even have a chance to win the, the, the beauty, the, the beauty portion.  And there was a young woman by the name of Barbara Tanell (ph.) who won.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, I, I don't, I wouldn't agree with you.  I mean I've, I mean I saw you when you were--(unclear)--you, you would have, you'd been a contest, you'd, you'd be a good contestant to--
Speaker 2: Well, thank you.
Speaker 1: --the whole thing.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: [HM] Florence LaRue as well, you know--
Speaker 2: Oh, Florence--
Speaker 1: --who came along--
Speaker 2: Now Florence came along the following year, and she won the Miss Grand Talent Award the following year.  And she, she ended up one of the finalist too, in the beauty part.
Speaker 1: But it does, you know, it does say something to win the Grand Talent Award in any--to be considered--
Speaker 2: Oh, that's--
Speaker 1: --the most talented of any--
Speaker 2: --that's what I wanted.
Speaker 1: --gathering of people is--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --is something.
Speaker 2: That was, you know, that was, that was why I was there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 172011
Speaker 1: And now did this, did you meet Lamonte Lamec-McLemore [HM Lamonte McLemore] around this time?
Speaker 2: I met Lamonte McLemore.  Lamonte was one of the photographers who was shooting all the young women that were part of the, were part of the, the beauty pageant.  And we became friends, and Lamonte was telling me about a group that he was singing with.  And they would, they would rehearse at his photo studio in the evenings.  And so I went over there, and I met some of the people, and I ended up being part of the group.  And that was the group that was the Hi-Fi's.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, I just wondered when I heard that name, how many groups are called the Hi-Fi's (laughter)--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: I know.  Everybody was a Hi-Fi, right.
Speaker 1: For, for those who don't know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --who are listening to this, you know, stereos are called high-fidelity, hi-fi's--
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.
Speaker 1: --you know, in those days.  So everybody talking about puttin' a record on a hi-fi, you know.  So, I mean it was--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --very, you know--
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: --popular name, so.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So the hi, the hi, these hi-fi's--
Speaker 2: So weren't very original, but we sounded good (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I would say though that this group of Hi-Fi's were, you know--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: We were good.  There was a man by the name of Rex Middleton, who was from St. Louis [Missouri].  There I go with my St. Louis connection there.  So, Rex became involved with the group, and he started teaching us wonderful harmonics, jazz.  I mean Rex had a most incredible ear, and he could, he would put together all of these chords, and we did some good stuff.  And we worked at a couple of clubs.  I mean I was going to school during the day and singing in clubs on the weekends with, with the group.  Of course, I wasn't twenty one at the time, but we didn't bother telling the club owners that (laughter)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Nobody asked, so.
Speaker 1: You were like nineteen--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in '62 [1962], right--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --nineteen years old?  So--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 172012
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is, this is, this, this is--so how, how many gigs would you do in a week?  Did you, did you sing?
Speaker 2: We didn't work that much.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, I mean I, school was still number one.  And my mother [Mary Ellen Holloway McCoo] was okay with us working on the weekends because she, either she would come, or she would have a friend of the family's that would be there just to make sure that, that there was no funny stuff going on.  And I, I wasn't drinking or anything like that.  I wasn't really there to drink.
Speaker 1: Now this is something we, when we interviewed some of the Motown too, they, they talk about, you know, the concern that their mothers and pee--other family members would have about them performing in a club.  And, and you know, they needed to be chaperoned and--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --young women especially, you know, of course.
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: Young men are days--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I have a story for you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Fritz Baskett was the other young lady that was in the group that, that I became a part of with Lamonte, [HM] Harry Elston, who ended up being, who ended up starting the Friends of Distinction, and another by the name of Larry Summers, and Rex Middleton.  So, one time Fritz and I had the opportunity to work at a place called the California Club.  It was over on, on Martin Luther King Boulevard.  At that time it was called Santa Barbara Avenue.  But, so we had an opportunity to work there.  Well, the California Club was not too cool, and, but I wanted to sing there because it was a wonderful opportunity.  And Fritz and I were singing some duets, and we were gonna open for the Coasters, or Cornell Gunter.  Actually, it was Cornell Gunter of the Coasters.  He had left the Coasters.  So anyway, so we had this opportunity to work there, but I didn't tell my mother about it because I knew she'd say no.  So we accepted the job, but I didn't say anything to my mother.  One day I came home from school, and I walked in the house.  And there was the Los Angeles Sentinel was sitting right there on the, there was a, a cedar chest in the entry.  And it was opened to the advertisement that, that was in the paper.  I walked in and I saw--(unclear)--[deep inhale]--(laughter), and I thought, oh my God, busted.  So now I'm thinking oh, now what am I gonna tell my mother?  So now I'm starting to think of what kind of lie can I come up with.  And I realized there was no way to lie out of this.  I mean it was right there in front of us.  So my mother comes walking out, and she just looked at me.  And I said um; she said when were you gonna tell me about this?  And I said I wasn't.  She said oh, you weren't?  How were you gonna do it?  I said well, well, I was just gonna tell you I was going out, and then I was gonna go down and, and, and work at the California Club and then come home.  And she said and you didn't think I was gonna find out about?  (Laughter) But my mother was so cool.  She knew how passionate I was about my music.  And you know what?  She let me work there that weekend.  But she came down, and she would be there to make sure that there was nothing going on.  Or, there was another friend of the family's who would come over, and he would be there, and he'd make sure that I was okay.  And he was a cop, so nobody was gonna mess with him (laughter).
Story_ID: 172013
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, now, okay, so, oh, I forgot to ask you about the Jet centerfold.  Now, now--
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: --[HM] Lamonte McLemore was famous for shooting Jet centerfolds.
Speaker 1: That's right, yes.
Speaker 2: And you were a centerfold.
Speaker 1: I was a centerfold.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, how did, did this change your life at all?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Did people recognize you from the centerfold, or did they, or did it have any effect?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: I just wondered.  I--
Speaker 1: I didn't get, I didn't get discovered from that (laughter), not from that either.
Speaker 2: I know how popular the centerfolds are--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: --and the people, you know, young black men especially--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know, open the book right, right to that page and you know, so-
Speaker 1: Yep.
Story_ID: 172014
Speaker 1: I did wanna mention that when I was in the Miss Bronze California Pageant, do you remember an actress by the name of Vonetta McGee?  Yeah, God rest her soul, she was a good friend.  Vonetta was in the Miss Bronze California Pageant the same year that I was, and we became good friends.  And she was just as crazy as a Betsy bug (laughter).  She was as sweet as she could be, and it was very exciting to watch her acting career develop.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was, she was really popular, and--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --I, I, I think every time I--I know she was in this, the last movie I saw her in was '[The] Eiger Sanction' with Clint Eastwood.
Speaker 1: That's right.  Yes, she did.
Speaker 2: And, and it was like a big mainstream action adventure movie.  He was--and she was the love interest of a major white star.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  That's right.
Speaker 1: Yes, [HM] Mr. Davis [Billy Davis Jr.] agrees (laughter), as we can hear.  But that's, but, but that's--and then for some--you know, I didn't see here in anything else after that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, you know, she ended up getting married.  Carl [Lumbly] --I'm trying to remember her husband's last name.  She married another actor, and they, they, they had a family.  What was Carl's last name?  Carl did a lot of television, and I just can't think of is last name right now.
Speaker 1: Not the one that played opposite of Rocky in the--not, not that Carl, not, not the former football player that--
Speaker 2: No, no, he wasn't--
Speaker 1: No, not him?
Speaker 2: No, he wasn't a football player.
Speaker 1: I know she was, she was linked to Max Julien.  I know they were--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and Max, I think--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: She and Max did have a relationship for a while, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I, I wondered what happened to her.  But she, she was beautiful, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So they must had quite a, quite a set of contestants there when you--
Speaker 2: Carl Lumbly.
Speaker 1: Carl Lumbly?
Speaker 2: Yes, she was--
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: --she married Carl Lumbly, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.  He's a great actor.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I mean I say that not just be, I just, he's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --he was a great actor.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: A fine actor, yes--
Speaker 1: He was real, really great--
Speaker 2: --yes indeed.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I, I, I don't know what he's doing.  I haven't seen anything from him for a long time.
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I haven't seen, I haven't seen him in a while.
Speaker 1: He's really good.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 172015
Speaker 1: So anyway, back to--so the Hi-Fi's are--well, you're still a minor with the Hi-Fi's, and at a certain point Hi-Fi's, they, they mu--they, they're still together until what, '65 [1965], '64 [1964] or '65 [1965]?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, we stayed-- sa Okay.
Speaker 1: --together until the end of sixty-four [1964].
Speaker 2: And what--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now you had Ray Charles--
Speaker 1: How did Ray Charles--
Speaker 2: Yeah, how did--
Speaker 1: --come into the picture?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, I don't remember exactly how we met Ray Charles.  And [HM] Lamonte McLemore might have had something to with it because Lamonte was always trying to hook up the group with somebody.  But Ray heard the group, and he liked what he heard.  And he decided that he wanted to record us, and he did.  He recorded us on his label, and we recorded a song called 'Lonesome Mood' and a couple of other things.  And it was also during that time--so, Ray started managing the group.  And now I was still in school, and Fritz Baskett was still in school, but he guys were ready to go out and work.  You know, they wanted to go out on the road, so they went to Ray and said hey, why don't you take us out on the road?  You know, you're managing us, and, and we're not doing anything, and you're out on the road.  So Ray decided that he would take us out, and we ended up opening the show for him.
Speaker 2: Now this is really, this is like your father [Wayman McCoo] singing with Fletch Henderson [Fletcher Henderson].
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it was, it was amay--
Speaker 2: Your--
Speaker 1: --it was a wonderful opportunity.
Speaker 2: Ray Charles--
Speaker 1: As a matter of fact, I dropped out of school for a semester to go out on tour with Ray Charles.  My mother [Mary Ellen McCoo] was not pleased about this at all.  So, and I was not twenty-one yet.  And I'm, I'm forgetting Joe, Joe--what's Joe's last name?
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA MALE VOICE):  (Unclear)--
Speaker 1: Thank you, baby, okay.
Speaker 2: What, what was it?
Speaker 1: I'm just, I'm--now, my mother was not--
Speaker 2: What's his last name?  What was Joe's last name?
Speaker 1: I'm gonna give it to.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna give it to you in--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So now, my mother was not excited about this at all.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I wasn't twenty one yet.  But Joe Adams, who was managing Ray Charles now at this time, he came to my mother and he talked to her.  And, and you know, he said you know your daughter wants to go out, and the group is gonna go out.  And, and we'll, we'll take good care of her (laughter).  And my mother didn't believe that at all.  As a matter of fact, she told Lamonte, she said you all make sure my daughter is okay.  And she made me promise her that when I came back home that I would go right back to school and finish and graduate, because I only had about twenty seven units left at the time that I dropped out.  And it was an amazing experience for me.  I really got a chance to learn what goes out, what goes on out on the road.  I got a chance to sit out in the audience and watch Ray Charles perform.  He was so amazing.  What a brilliant, brilliant artist.  And I really, really enjoyed those three months.
Story_ID: 172016
Speaker 1: And it was also a really good experience for me because I saw how tough the road can be.
Speaker 2: Now-
Speaker 1: And I saw how tough the road can be for women.  And I decided right then that when I got finished, that I was definitely going back to school so that I could get my degree, because I didn't know if I was ever going to succeed in the entertainment world.  And I did need to have some kind of, you know, some kind of way of, of taking care of myself.  And so I needed to have my degree so I could get a decent job.
Speaker 2: Okay, you say it's especially tough for women.  We can only imagine, but tell us what, what, in, what, what respect?
Speaker 1: Well, you know, there are a lot of, there are a lot of guys out there that are gonna, you know, go after the women.  And a lot of times, you know, if, if you--they're gonna expect you to play ball with them if you wanna, if you wanna break.  And if you don't want to do what they're proposing that you, that, that you do, then you have to be able to have a job to fall back on.  You have to be able to say no.  And the only way I knew I would be able to really have the, you know, have the ability to say no, and to know that I could take care of myself, I could feed myself, and, and work on a half-way decent job is to have a degree.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so I said okay.
Story_ID: 172017
Speaker 1: All right, now, it's 1964.  Now, help me out if my memory is wrong, but I think that Ray Charles's big hit around that time period was 'Hit the Road Jack'--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --and don't you come back--
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes.  And they did that every night--as an--although they used to end, they used to end the show with 'What I Say,' but 'Hit the Road Jack' was, was a big, big song for them.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'Enduring Star,' Ray Charles--now, what did the, the Hi-Fi's, what was the Hi-Fi's repertoire, you know, as an opening act for Ray Charles?
Speaker 2: I don't remember what songs we did.  I don't remember what songs we did on that show.  But we sang about four, four jazz, four jazz songs.
Speaker 1: They were jazz--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You, so, so you categorize them as jazz songs?
Speaker 2: Yep, we, we kept, you know--
Speaker 1: --the--
Speaker 2: --we were a jazz group.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was fine with Ray because ja, Ray loved jazz, and Ray loved what we were doing, so he was presenting us as, you know, one of his acts.
Speaker 1: So did you sing with orchestration?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: We had seventeen musicians out there.  And Ray had his own plane.  We used to call it the buzzard, and we flew around on the buzzard (laughter).
Speaker 1: Why the buzzard?  What (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter)--(unclear)--that was what they called it.  You know, we got there it, it was already the buzzard, so we just fell right in.

Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right.  So, you went back to UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] and graduated in '65 [1965].  Are there any--now you got a degree in business administration?
Speaker 2: Well, what happened was, okay, I started out in theater arts, and I was working on, working on my music career outside of school.  After I had been in theater arts for about a year and a half, I met a young woman who had just graduated from UCLA with a degree in theater arts, and she was selling tickets at a movie theater.  Now I was always a survivor, and selling tickets at a movie theater was not the way I saw myself working.  I said that's okay if you're in school and you're making a little extra money, but by the time you graduate from, from college, you're expected to go into a halfway decent job that's gonna have some, you know, some promotional opportunities.  So, I decided to change my major, and I changed from theater arts to business administration (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I figured that--so then I thought maybe accounting would be interesting.  So I tried accounting, and, and that was okay, but it wasn't me.
Speaker 1: So did you figure that you were already operating as a professional entertainer, and so I mean you'd already achieved a goal, you know, an artistic--you were in the game--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I wasn't making much money.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, I, you know, I, when I, when I went out on the road with the group, my mother [Mary Ellen Holloway McCoo] sent me out with some money so that if I needed to come home, I had enough money to buy an airline ticket to get home.
Story_ID: 172019
Speaker 1: Okay, so now, let, let me just go, backtrack.  How many mem, members were there in the Wi-fi--in, in, in the Hi--
Speaker 2: In the Hi-Fi's?
Speaker 1: --Hi-Fi's?
Speaker 2: There were six of us.
Speaker 1: Okay, six.  Okay, that's a--
Speaker 2: We had five singers.  And by that time, Rex Middleton was no longer with us.  We--Clarence McDonald, the keyboardist was, was playing with the group, and so that was, that was how we made up the six of us.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, whatever you got paid had to be split--
Speaker 2: We had to split it.
Speaker 1: --in sixths.
Speaker 2: We had to pay, we had to pay for our hotel rooms, and we had to pay for our food.  And so--
Speaker 1: Out of your pay, you had to pay your own?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: You had to pay your own hotel and food--
Speaker 2: We had to pay our own hotels, and we had to pay for our own food.  And so we didn't come home with much money.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we just wanted to be out on the road, you know.  So--
Speaker 1: You--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --I just knew that that was okay then, but that wasn't gonna be great for a lifestyle.
Speaker 1: Right, now this is, this kind of shatters the image a lot of people have of the, you know, glamorous entertainment life.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you mind me asking you how much you would, you know, I mean we have to prorate the money, of course, but how much were you getting for a, a show with Ray Charles after all was--
Speaker 2: Oh, man, I don't even remember exactly how much it was.  But it was, I mean, you know, Fritz [Baskett] and I had to split, we had to split, you know, we, we shared a room and had to split that.  And boy, I don't remember exactly how much it was, but it wasn't much.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: By the time you got finished, you didn't have much left over.
Speaker 1: And you, so this is the reason your mother [Mary Ellen Holloway McCoo] is actually giving you money--
Speaker 2: Well, she--
Speaker 1: --to take--
Speaker 2: --she gave me, she gave me some money to leave town with, and she told me to let her know if I needed any more.  Well, I've always known how to stretch a dollar, so (laughter), so I didn't have to ask her for any more money.  But I, when I came home I was able to give her her money back because I didn't need it for the airline ticket.

Speaker 1: We're talking about now the, I guess towards the end of the Hi-Fi's, how--the Hi-Fi's reached their peak, you know, in '64 [1964] touring with Ray Charles.
Speaker 2: Ray Charles, yeah.
Speaker 1: And so, so what were you thinking?  Were you saying, you know, this is--I'm gonna have it made after this.  Sixty, sixty-four [1964] is just the beginning of many, of a great and a glorious entertainment career, or what were you thinking?
Speaker 2: I was thinking that it was time to, it was time to get out of the group, that this was not the way I wanted to work.  I really cared a great deal about the members of the group, but I really wanted a solo career.  And working, working with the group had been a lot of fun because it, because, again, I, I loved the harmonics; I loved the jazz singing.  But I, this wasn't--I, I, didn't feel like we were all dedicated the way I was.  And by the time we got back home from the tour, I said it was a wonderful experience.  It was something I really needed to learn about.  And it's time to get my hat.  And so when we got home, I told the group that I was, I, that I didn't wanna sing with the group anymore, that I was going back to school, and I was gonna get my degree, and that was it.  So I didn't know if they were gonna replace me or what they were going to do, but I knew what I, I needed to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so that's what I did.  I, I went, I came back home.  And Eddie Beal, my mentor, hired me in his office (laughter) to be his secretary while I was waiting for the next semester to start.  I was the, I was the worst.  I mean I could, I could answer the phone.  I could, I mean, it was the typing that was really bad.  But God bless him, you know, he was always in my corner.  And so I worked for Eddie, and then when school started I went back to school, and I finished up my degree.  I went back to summer school--I mean I went to the spring semester, and then I went to double sessions of summer school, and graduated.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you came out in '65 [1965]?
Speaker 2: Came out in '65' [1965], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  See, you were at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles California] when they had the great basketball teams, with John Wooden and all--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Walt Hazaard was there, Fritz [Baskett], Fred Slaughter, and they were all friends.
Speaker 1: Did, did you have a particular mentor in the business department--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It's often the case.  I mean I always ask that quet, questions 'cause sometimes there's somebody.  But there, there are times when there's nobody really there.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, if had really, really been serious about have, wanting a career in the business world, then perhaps I would have found a mentor.  But I was still very serious about my music.  But like I said before, I wanted to have something to fall back on so that I could have a decent life, a decent career if my music didn't pay off for me.
Story_ID: 172021
Speaker 1: Now did you think about, where did you see your career going?  Did you see yourself like, you know, on Broadway or, or as a solo, solo act, or you see yourself with Motown, or did you have any, any vision of what you--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: I didn't know, I didn't know what form it would take or if it would take any form at all.  I didn't have a, a vision of where it was going to go or how it was going to happen.  I've never done that, you know.  Some people say well, in five years I wanna be doing this, and I wanna be here.  I've never done that.  I've just known that I wanted to go somewhere, and I didn't know how I was gonna get there.  But I just knew that that's where I wanted to go, and I didn't know if it would take five years, ten years, twenty years.  And I mean, over the years, you know, as you see how some people have success early; some people success later, but if it's your desire, if it's your dream, if it's your ambition, then you just, you stick at, you stick at it.
Speaker 1: Now did you know about the, the end of the Hi-Fi's?  I mean I guess they broke up after you, sometime after you left, right?
Speaker 2: Okay, and what about them?
Speaker 1: Do you, did, did you know about the, the group breaking up, actually, 'cause it hadn't broken up when you were there.  You, you, you left, but you, you thought that they would replace you or--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, I told them that I was gonna go.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And I didn't know what they were going to do, but I knew what I had to do.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you didn't think about--
Speaker 2: [HM] Lamonte [McLemore] and I stayed friends though.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Lamonte and I stayed friends.  [HM] Harry [Elston] and I were friends, Fritzy [Fritz Baskett]; we were all still friends, but, and then I found out that the group really did, did break up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And everybody started trying to figure out what they were going to do.
