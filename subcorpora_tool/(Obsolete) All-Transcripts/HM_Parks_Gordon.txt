Speaker 1: I just want you to state your name and spell it for us and your date of birth and today's date.
Speaker 2: Gordon Parks G-O-R-D-O-N P-A-R-K-S born November the 30th, 1912 in Fort Scott, Kansas.
Speaker 1: And today is March 12th?
Speaker 2: Today is March the 12th.
Speaker 1: 2001.
Speaker 2: 2001.
Speaker 1: And your profession, sir?
Speaker 2: My profession is difficult 'cause I think I was an artist, photographer, writer, painter, poet, film director, and a lover. (Laughter) I threw her.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Renaissance man.  That's what we call a lover.
Story_ID: 18899
Speaker 1: I'd like to start out by asking you what your favorite color is.
Speaker 2: I think my favorite color is blue mixed with green.  I think that's possibly my favorite color.
Speaker 1: Your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Autumn.
Speaker 1: Your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I have different ones, a place where I used to live in the south of France near Cannes where we used to have a family home, Barbados, Puerto Rico, and in the winter Vail, up in Vail, Colorado where I skied for the last thirty-five years.
Speaker 1: Your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food?  I don't know.  I would think that a good steak, vegetables of all kinds.  Certainly salad is a favorite of mine, a lot of salad.  I now blend raw vegetables into a mixer and have consumed that once a day.  In the morning I do the same with bananas and apples, pears, orange juice, and blend that.  Then I have one solid meal in the evening.  It could be lamb chops.  It could be steak or fish.  I eat more fish than I do eat meat.  I eat meat now, well, at least twice a week because of advice of my doctor who thinks I should help that, the anemia.  I have a slight anemia.  I actually like the taste of it, if it's cooked right.
Speaker 1: What about, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Do I have a favorite phrase?  I don't know.  I used to - my father [Andrew Jackson Parks] used to talk about your enemies in the world, you know, how to overcome them, and I remember him saying that you waltz around your enemies and do a foxtrot on their back, and my mother [Sarah Parks] used to say to me that I was not to come home and complain about people that said something or not being able to attain something because I was black.  She would say if a white boy can do it, you can do it, and you can do it better.  If you don't do it better, don't come home.  I fell for that, but she meant what she said.
Story_ID: 18900
Speaker 1: Why did you write that, 'The Learning Tree,' at the time it was written?  Why did you write it as fictional?
Speaker 2: I didn't think I could write at all at that particular time.  Carl Mydans, who was a writer and photographer at 'Life'  and encouraged me, he said, "You talk a lot about your childhood in Kansas.  You have a good novel.  Did you ever think about writing it?" And I said, "I can't write a novel."  He said, "Did you ever try?" And I said, "No." So he said, "Why don't you go home this weekend and try," and I went home that weekend -- pardon me -- and came up with seven triple-spaced pages, I think.  I showed them to Carl on Monday, and Wednesday I got a call from a gentleman who called himself a friend of Carl's.  He said he wanted to take me to lunch, and his name was Evan Thomas. So I asked Carl who he was, and he said that's the Executive Vice President of Harper Row Publishing Company. And he says, "Why?  Did he call you?"  I said, "Yes, he called."  "What does he want?"  I said, "He wants to take me to lunch." He says, "Well, my God, I better go with you." And I said, "Yes, you had." So he went with me, and Evan offered me five thousand dollars which was a lot of money in those days, and he says, you know, "I'd give you more, but you haven't never written a novel, and we don't know." But I said "Well, Mr. Thomas --"  He said, "Well, come on back to the table, and let's talk some more." And he got back there, and he said, "I'll offer you ten [thousand dollars], and that's as high as I can go."  He thought that I was saying that it wasn't enough.  I was trying to say, "Mr. Thomas, I can't write this novel.  I can't promise you," but I said, "Since you've offered me all this money, I'm damned well gonna try." And he said, "We'll give you good editorship," and he did. And the editor turned out to be Gene Young, a young Chinese woman who eventually became my wife.  She edited three of my first books.  I wrote 'The Learning Tree' because I knew it so well.  I didn't want to do a straight autobiography, you know.  I just - I thought it was more romantic to fictionalize it, I suppose, and as it stands, it's about 90 percent true.  You have to adjust, make adjustments to writing a novel as you do in motion, making a motion picture.  When I did the motion picture of 'The Learning Tree,' I had to make adjustments to make things fit, make them more dramatic or less dramatic or whatever I chose to do.
Story_ID: 18901
Speaker 1: But, you know, let's talk about your mother.  What about - because just - if you could just tell briefly about her and her background.  You've talked a lot about it, but I was wondering if 'The Learning Tree' is all that, you know, in terms of Miss Swinger, is that your mother?  Was that your mother really portrayed?
Speaker 2: My mother [Sarah Parks] was born in Tennessee in Nashville.  I don't know much about her backdrop before that.  I don't even know where she and my father [Andrew Jackson Parks] met. I knew my father was born in Oklahoma, but she was just a very highly religious woman, free of any prejudice against anybody, and taught that to me and taught me to have respect for older people and for women.  I had seven sisters, and they were the same way.  They were all my sort of mothers you know, and before my mother died and I was only fifteen, she just taught me about love and respect, things of that sort.  There was never any doubt about her authority as a mother.  She was the boss of that whole family, seven boys and eight girls.
Speaker 1: Do you know how she ended up coming to - I know you say you don't know much about her background, but do you know how she ended up coming to Fort Park or.
Speaker 2: I don't know why she came to Fort Scott [Kansas].  I really don't know where they, where she met my father.  He was from Oklahoma, part Cherokee and from a Cherokee family, and where they met, I don't know.  I was just trying to search that out now if I can.  I'd like to know.
Speaker 1: Did she ever share any stories with you about her growing up?  I know you're the youngest.
Speaker 2: No.  She never shared any stories with me.  It was - in retrospect it was a relationship of a young child with his mother.  She had all her problems of keeping the family together.  I don't think she ever thought about sitting down with me and telling me about her travel or anything of that sort.
Story_ID: 18902
Speaker 1: What about your father?  What do you know about his background?
Speaker 2: I know even less about my father's [Andrew Jackson Parks] background.  He -- as I said, part of the family was Cherokee, and he had three brothers, and I got to know all them one way or the other.  One was a blind man.  Well, he got his fingers blown off in an explosion and was blinded and was.
Speaker 1: That was Uncle Jim.
Speaker 2: Uncle Jim.  He was more my mentor than my father was.  My father - I don't know.  I don't know if he spoke twenty-five thousand words to me during his lifetime.  He was always morning, boy, did you feed the hogs?  Yes, sir.  Did you feed the chickens?  Yes, sir.  Okay, and that was it for the day unless I did something wrong.  I wanted peanut brittle.  I might hit him for five cents or something like that, but he was a good father.  He was strong.  He supported his family on a plot of land at the side of the house, and although we were what you might say poverty-stricken, he provided us with food.  I never went hungry when I was a kid, and living up to the standards that a good mother and father project for their family, you know.
Story_ID: 18903
Speaker 1: Always prayer meetings, Sunday school, BYPU [Baptist Young People's Union] Meetings - everything was uplifting.  Girls couldn't wear silk stockings.  No jazz music in the house.  It was that strict but not so that it would hurt you, hurt your feelings.  If you wanted to hear jazz, hear it someplace else but not at home.
Story_ID: 18904
Speaker 1: Now all fifteen of you were in what would be - were in one house.  How large was that?  Was it - no, because the others had --
Speaker 2: No, there were not all fifteen.  My father [Andrew Jackson Parks] had fifteen children so seven boys, eight boys -- I think seven boys and eight girls.  I think that's what it was, and the first, his first wife, I didn't know naturally.  After she died then he married my mother [Sarah Parks], and she had ten children, but the half-brothers and sisters would come now and then.  They respected my mother, and they adopted her as their real mother, and my mother adopted them as her real children.  So, I didn't even know they were my half-brothers and sisters until I was a teenager, and Mary was a half-sister, Ben was a half-brother.  I didn't know anything about that because we all reacted to one another as though we were brothers and sisters.
Story_ID: 18905
Speaker 1: Mr. Parks, what -- I'd like you to share three stories with us, you know, up until the time that your mother, you know, passed away, and I was wondering if you would - three fond memories that you have, you know, growing up, up until that point.
Speaker 2: Three fond memories?
Speaker 1: Memories, memories, memories.
Speaker 2: Well.
Speaker 1: School, home, whatever. Art, friends.
Speaker 2: I suppose my fondest memories -- I've never been asked that before -- playing marbles with my buddy, John Young. Riding horses.  My father [Andrew Jackson Parks] had a couple of horses.  I loved to ride horses and mentally portray myself as a cowboy (laughter).  I loved that.  You know, there was so much murder and, you know, discrimination at that time for me that it sort of wiped out the good memories, to tell you the truth.  There was plenty of discrimination and bigotry, segregated schools and things of that sort.  I suppose that one of the best memories was my playing the trombone, a contest for school orchestras, and I played the trombone, a valve trombone.  I've never seen one since and won the state contest by playing 'The Rosary.'  All my musc was learned by just trying it.  I was never given a chance to study.  We had an old Kimball upright piano, and my mother persuaded me to play when my father wasn't around.  He didn't particularly like a boy playing the piano for some reason or other.  I guess the word was sissy, but when my mother was around, I could play the piano, and that's the way I learned how to play the piano.  He gave my sisters lessons by an old German teacher.  He would come by with a ruler and thump their fingers if they didn't hit the right notes.  They hated it, but I use to stand on the side and look and listen, and I was never given a chance to have lessons and things of that sort.  Possibly it was good for me because it may have influenced me too much doing things the way that I wanted to do them.
Speaker 1: Now you - what I find - are there any other memories that you have that you might share?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know of any one memory that's so outstanding that I consider it to be a grand memory or anything so the memories that I have or that -- pardon me -- really stick are the memories of my mother's [Sarah Parks] death and things of that sort, the things that happened where someone was killed or something of that sort.  I know that I developed a great fear of death when I was young.
Story_ID: 18906
Speaker 1: When you talked about -- just now you were saying that there was tremendous, you know, discrimination, and you felt that -- but at the same time you described how a German teacher was actually coming to teach piano lessons, you know, in this black home so I just want -- you know, that seems like a contradiction in many ways because there was more interaction in this town between whites and blacks, you know, typically, and I'd like you to sort of describe the environment that you grew up in.
Speaker 2: Well, the German teacher, by the way, was paid seventy-five cents for each lesson so that was his meal ticket if he had enough students.  I can't say I didn't have white friends.  There was Allan Burke.  I think his name was Burke, Waldo, Waldo Wade, and we used to play marbles together.  Some of us swam together and that sort in the river, but we may have a ball game which was organized by our groups in the neighborhood on the East Side or the West Side of town but going to an all black junior high school and grade school, an all black grade school.  The high schools had finally integrated, but I think -- because I don't think the white town fathers could afford to build another high school.  That's the only reason they put us together, but there we were not allowed to go to any of their class functions and the parties and things with the white kids.  We were not allowed to participate in athletics like basketball or football or track, even though we were the best athletes, and so Professor Hawkins who was the principal of the junior high school formed this team of black players called the Fort Scott Whirlwinds which won championships in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Missouri.  It was one of the finest teams in that area, and it was principally because they stuck together.  They had known each other since they were six years old, most of the players, and they learned to shoot through barrel hoops and things so when it came to the regular hoops and things that you see on the basketball court, we could do it with such ease that we wiped everybody out.  We'd have to practice because we'd been brought up to shoot through an inferior round circle, a barrel on a board that we pasted up, and so when we got on a real basketball court, we were demons and were very good and the same way with track and things of that sort.  You had to run fast if you were caught on the east - the white side or east side of town a certain time of the night, things of that sort, but Harold Brookins, it was Harold turned out to be one of my best friends, and the other white boys that I remember, one or two that I liked very much.  They liked me very much.  Waldo Wade's parents were not what one would hope they would be, and there were jails, and Waldo was a young man without a home, and for awhile my mother took him into our home and provided Waldo with whatever he needed, and there were black people in the area didn't particularly like it, and there were white people that didn't like it, but my mother didn't care what they thought.  Waldo needed a home, and Waldo got a home, and Waldo never forgot her.
Speaker 1: So that's a true story in 'The Learning Tree.'
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.
Story_ID: 18907
Speaker 1: Now the other - what about the story of the trial?  Was that a true story or was that fictionalized [in 'The Learning Tree']?  The, you know, I forget the name right now, but remember he had accused the man?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right.  Is that a true story?
Speaker 2: It's partially true.  I fictionalized some of that.  Yeah.  Partially true.
Speaker 1: Would you - which part of it did you fictionalize?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's very difficult to remember exactly which part because I wrote the screenplay, but.
Speaker 1: Right.  I understand.
Speaker 2: I just tried to make it fit.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I understand.  I understand.
Speaker 2: Now so this what - you're growing up.  Your mother is -- it's not ter -- it is black and white, but there is interaction with whites.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: There were white people in the town who respected my mother [Sarah Parks] very much.  I remember once I was -- my sisters, two sisters, Gladys and Lynn, had some boyfriends from Pittsburg, Kansas who came over to see them and have a party, and I don't think I wrote about this.  The boys in Fort Scott [Kansas] didn't like the fact that Pittsburg boys came over for the party.  I was working on the ice cream freezer, and they kidnapped me and the freezer, the black boys did, and put me on the back of the truck, and I don't know what they were gonna do with me, and the freezer and drove up the hill. But I jumped off the truck, the 'Wolsey's Music Store,'  'Wolsey's Music Store' on the truck, and one of the boys whose name was Elijah Wells was driving the truck.  Another one named -- I think it was Johnny Whitener was with him.  They were showing their resentment.  They came, and I have a scratched up, and I jumped off the truck.  I know they were brought to trial, and my mother was at the trial naturally, and they was sentenced by the judge, and my mother got up and swished up and says judge, I would like to present the judgment on these young men.  What you're doing is too harsh, and so the judge said all right Sarah, what do you want to do?  She said I want them to come to prayer meting every Wednesday night for two years, and Elijah Wells told me I would rather accepted the judge's sentence than go to prayer meeting at a Methodist church for two years in a row.  We used to laugh about that years later.  He said your mother, she really passed a horrible sentence out, but that's what they had to do.  They had to go to - never miss a night.  If they did, they'd get the other sentence in jail.
Speaker 2: So they actually - he ended up meting out your mother's request, that sentence?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 18908
Speaker 1: You know the other question I have also for you, Mr. Parks, is, was there a relationship, you know, because your father was part Cherokee, was there a relationship or do you remember a relationship with, you know, between blacks and Indian tribes at all?  Do you remember?  Was there any of that occurring in this town because you talk about black and white.  Was there any Indian influence?
Speaker 2: You mean that bl -- did they work together or something?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Was there any interaction between, you know, Indians and blacks in the town that you grew up with or around (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, one time the Indians -- my father [Andrew Jackson Parks] was -- part of my father's family was Cherokee from Oklahoma, and there wasn't that much interaction between blacks and whites.  They sort of stayed apart, lived apart, and the only interaction I know was between the families where the black person worked like my mother [Sarah Parks] was the maid in the family.
Story_ID: 18909
Speaker 1: You said that the thing that really impacted you -- there was a lot of death around you, but you said your mother's death impacted you and you even talk in the book ['The Learning Tree'] about the family sort of falling apart at that time, and I'm just wondering if you could recount as a young boy the feelings you felt.
Speaker 2: When my mother died?
Speaker 1: Um hmm.
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't actually know my mother [Sarah Parks] was dying, okay.  I knew that when she'd come in from work, she would -- I do remember her sitting in the dining room with me and putting her arms around me and sort of sitting rather quietly and sort of wiping her mouth with a rag or something.  She -- evidently something was wrong with her heart.  We didn't know.  My father [Andrew Jackson Parks] was working in the fields, and she would just sit and talk to me and put her arms around me and say, "What you'd do today?" and so forth and so on and, "You must be a good boy."  Why suddenly I should've been a good boy all my life, but now she is really making an emphasis, and what she was thinking was that she wanted to get me out of Kansas.  She knew she was dying.  At least she thought she was, and she knew I was very afraid of death because I had seen so much.  The cop in the movie ['The Learning Tree'] whose name was Kirby, his real name was Kirby, and he existed, and he did kill some black boys, and my mother wanted me to get out of there as soon as possible.  I'm sure she told my father that when something happens to me -- and I remember that my brother Clem called me to her bedside with Elmer Connor, my best buddy, and she advised both of us to be good boys - just like that, "Work hard."  Why, Elmer and I wondered why we been summoned to her bedside for this, and later on my mother -- that same evening my mother died so Clem knew what was happening.  He was older, and he brought me to her bed, not knowing what else to do other than what he did, and by that time I was so concerned about the death I had seen around me.  Anthony Hawkins had been killed.  Johnny Young had been killed, my buddies, several other people.  Captain Tuck was found on the east side tracks dead, so forth and so on, and it got to be a sort of a fearful situation because -- and so she says, "You mustn't be afraid of death," you know, one of the things she had told me.  "Don't - why are you so afraid of it?"  I said, "I don't know.  I'm scared of dying." But when they brought her home as they used to do, to bring the casket home, I got up in the middle of the night.  I guess it was about three o'clock in the morning.  I got enough nerve to walk into the front room where her casket was.  I lifted the cover, and I said, "Mama, I'm not afraid anymore," I guess because the one person who really loved me was my mother, and she would be looking after me for some reason or other, and I was scared.  I was frightened when I lifted it, but I was alone at three o'clock in the morning.  I had a blanket.  I put it around me, and I laid down on the floor.  I closed the top and laid down on the floor.  That's where my father found me sleeping, and he understood. And that's one of the memorable moments in my life, you know.
Story_ID: 18910
Speaker 1: Now your mother [Sarah Parks] -- okay, when she passes away, it's decided that the family has to make some changes, and you end up -- it's decided that you are gonna go to Minnesota to be with your sister?
Speaker 2: She had made up her mind, my sister, she wanted -- she had told my father [Andrew Jackson Parks] that I should be taken -- Maggie Lee should take me to St. Paul [Minnesota].  That's far north, to get me out of all this because she didn't think that my father had the strength, mental strength, to handle me and the two girls, Gladys and Lynn, the youngest. And that was her decision and my father was just passing it on to Maggie Lee who came down for the funeral. And before the flowers had wilted on her grave, my father had arranged for me to be taken back to St. Paul with Maggie Lee.  We called her Pinky, and so right after the funeral -- I remember the taxicab driver, I remember his name but it escapes me right now.  'Dan something' had a taxicab service, had an old Ford, and my bags were packed.  I didn't have much, a pasteboard, card -- pasteboard box with a handle on it and very few clothes. And so my father bid me goodbye, put his arms on my shoulder for a moment, turned away, and said, "Well, follow your mother's teachings, boy, and you'll be all right." And I think Maggie Lee said, "Aren't you gonna kiss your father?" And I said, "Well, yeah," kissed him on his stubbly cheek, and he sort of turned away and went on off to feed the hogs.  That's when I didn't see him until years later.
Story_ID: 18911
Speaker 1: Now you tell this whole story of arriving in St. Paul [Minnesota], you and your, you know, your brother-in-law.
Speaker 2: David.
Speaker 1: Had a falling out.  He sort of kicked you out, really.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And yet you were doing good in school, right?
Speaker 2: Um hmm.
Speaker 1: Um hmm, and so that whole -- that's a very -- I mean, you were how old were? -- you're fifteen?  Did it happen within like the first six months?
Speaker 2: I was fifteen.  I don't know.  I can't recall whether it was the first six months, but I know it was holiday season which made it very difficult because he was very cold towards me.  He didn't like kids at all, and my sister [Maggie Lee] knew this, and she didn't know quite what to do about it. And I, because of my basketball prowess which I had attained in Kansas shooting through the barrel hoops and things, the Diplomats asked me to join their club and play with them.  This was sort of a sophisticated black kids group called the Diplomats and the better dressed blacks in town and better educated, and so forth and so on, so I was sort of an oddity, the way I dressed, the way I spoke, the Kansas accent, and so forth, but they were very impressed with the way I could play basketball, and everybody was sort of after me, and that happened right after I got there, and they were arranging for some party or something during the holidays, and I was supposed to go, and it was a cold night, and I had been out the night before, not doing anything, not later than maybe 6:30 or seven [o'clock] or 8:00.  David wanted something to get at me about so I was going down to go to the club meeting for the preparation for this party, and that's when he said where are you going, and I said I'm going to the club meeting.  He said you're not going anyplace.  You were out last night and the night before.  You stay home.  He was just meanness.  He was a big guy, too.  I remember Crystal Graham was there, and she was a friend of my sister's.  My sister was all nervous, you know.  He said go back upstairs, just like that.  I said I'm going to the club meeting.  My Kansas came up in me.  My sister was very nervous, and she knew something was gonna happen, and then I started out the door.  He grabbed me and pulled me back. My sister rushed in and when he - I probably would've gone upstairs to keep things together, but he pushed my sister against the wall.  You don't push my sister.  He pushed my sister against the wall.  I hit him.  It was like a flea hitting an elephant.  He wrestled me down, grabbed me, and was choking me, and Crystal grabbed and umbrella in the umbrella rack and began to beat him over the head and said leave him alone, leave him alone, and so she was beating him pretty hard, and he turned me loose, and I got back out from underneath him and ran out the door, and it was cold.  It was very cold, below zero, way below, thirty-five [degrees below zero] or something.  Later that week it hit thirty-five [degrees below zero], which is deathly cold, especially if you're not adequately dressed for it, and he went upstairs, put all my clothes in my pasteboard box, threw it out the window, and said, "Get the hell out of here.  Stay out of here."  Crystal was living with friends of hers.  She didn't have anyplace to take me, and she said what are you gonna do?  I went to the pool hall which was about four blocks away to spend - to get out of the cold. That's when that started.
Speaker 1: Now did you - did he ever have any regrets, you think, about that?
Speaker 2: If he did, he never expressed them.  I went back to St. Paul.  I had become a 'Life' [magazine] photographer, and I was walking along with someone, George Berry who was a good friend of mine.  He said, "You see him?  That's David" - no, he said, "That's David Grissom.  That's your brother-in-law who kicked you out." And David was walking down the street, and for a moment I wanted to go speak to him and say hello, but I didn't.  I said well, I don't think I could take it.  I probably don't want to hit him, but then years later I thought, "Well, maybe he did me a favor by kicking me out early." And I got an early start, but my sister divorced him after that.
Story_ID: 18912
Speaker 1: Now that whole thing - you had to really learn how to survive.  You were surviving in any way possible.  Right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you talk -- you tell the story about how you, you know, went on the -- you got a -- you were riding the train back and, you know, the train.
Speaker 2: A streetcar.  The streetcar was in St. Paul, Minnesota.  You get on it in St. Paul.  You ride to the end of St. Paul, and you go to Minneapolis [Minnesota], and you ride to Minneapolis and come back. But after the pool hall closed there was a guy who rented the pool hall.  His name was Big T. Vernon.  He was a big fat guy, and I didn't -- he knew I was in trouble.  I was standing by the radiator to keep warm, and he said, "You in trouble, boy?" And I said, "Yeah," because he saw me with a suitcase. So I said, "Yeah," but I didn't unload on him that night, but I had a little money in my pocket.  I had been working at a restaurant doing something, a busboy, not a busboy.  It was this cheap restaurant, and I was cleaning it up and acting as a janitor and doing whatever they wanted me to do.  I had a little money in my pocket.  David had charged me, I think, two dollars and fifty cents a week for living.  I had enough money to ride the streetcar.  I got on at St. Paul, got into St. Paul, went into Minneapolis, came back the same way at the Union Station in the morning around about six o'clock. And I was going to Mechanical Arts High School, but it was during the holidays, and school was closed. So it made it difficult so I had to wait until the pool hall opened up, and eventually I got a job playing the piano in a house of ill repute on the north side of Minneapolis.  When T. asked me what I was gonna do, I told him, "I'll play the piano." And he said, "Well, I think I know the guy that needs a piano player."  His name is Ben Wilson.  I called him Pope in the book. And Ben came in one night and said, "I hear you can play the piano." And I said, "Yes." And he said, "Well, you want to play at my place?" And I said, "Where is your place?" And he said, "Over on Hennepin Avenue in Minneapolis."  I said, "I have no way to get over there."  He said, "Well, I'll take you over there, and we'll find a way for you to go back and forth."  He said, "Where are you living?" And I said, "I'm not living anyplace," you know, but I gave him my sister's [Maggie Lee] address. But anyway he took me over there, introduced me to an albino by the name of Red who beat the drums, and that's where I hung out and was living for a few weeks. And then one night a guy came in, I remember, and attacked another guy in the place with a knife, cut his throat.  The guy ran.  I remember he tried to escape out the door, but he finally went out of a window and fell three stories down to his death. And that was my last night there.  I couldn't take anymore of that, you know. But Ben Wilson was very famous.  He was infamous really.  He was - shot my brother-in-law, David, who became my brother-in-law later.  He shot him in the leg for something, and he carried a gun all the time.  He was a very dangerous man.

Speaker 1: See, what I'm curious about, Mr. Parks, you played basketball.  Was -- you're not a tall, tall man.  Was it -- but you were very good at basketball.
Speaker 2: Um hmm.
Speaker 1: I mean, what --
Speaker 2: (simultaneous) I was a --
Speaker 1: Were people --
Speaker 2: I was a very good shot.  I learned in Kansas, you know, as I say, shooting through these small barrel hoops, but now we got hoops this big. And I was just good at learning back in Fort Scott [Kansas], and when they formed this - Harry Crump, his name was, formed a team of - in St. Paul it was a Jewish, very famous Jewish team called the House of David, black baseball players.  They were very famous, but they had a House of David Basketball Team but that was only black, and there were only five men on the team.  There were no substitutes. And so Harry Crump was the coach, and he heard about me through the Diplomats and offered me a tryout for the team.  I won hands down, and I was made captain of the team, and I think I played guard back then.  In fact, I have the thing right here now if you want to see it later on, a poster of the team, and I survived that way for awhile, busboy, hotels, did everything.
Story_ID: 18914
Speaker 1: Now you -- so you get yourself back on your feet.  Did you finally grad -- you didn't graduate finally, though, did you?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: (simultaneous) No, because it was too --
Speaker 2: I went to Central High School which is a very up type high school in St. Paul [Minnesota].  I went to Mechanical Arts High School and Central, but Central High School, I was living - when I went to live with my sister [Maggie Lee] right on the edge of the white population, and Central High School was mostly all white kids and a few blacks, and they really grabbed me for the basketball team there, and I was made captain of the Central High School basketball team, and I was the only black on the team, and the rest of them were all white.  It's sort of muddled.  Sally [Alvis], I met Sally - my best friend turned out to be a young man named George Berry whose father was a Pullman porter, and they were kind of considered to be wealthy, you know.  They lived actually about two doors from the pool hall, and George was well educated.  He had a Ford Falcon which was a beautiful car his father bought him.  They spoiled him.  He went to the university and trained for medicine, doctor, but before that, we just - he just - his mother used to mother me, and George would take me to the house for food, and Mrs. Berry would talk to me like my mother and so on and so on, and they sort of adopted me in sort of a way, but George kept company with a girl by the name of Jane in Minneapolis, and he took me for a ride with them one day, and that's where I met Sally on sort of a blind date because she was a friend of Jane's, a very pretty girl, and I fell immediately in love, and I suppose she did, too, and so we all hung out together, another boy named Woody Mills, Woodford Mills.  The other little sister, Jane's sister, her name was Patty, and so we had this trio, and we dressed alike.  I managed to get enough money.  There was a guy named Ben Meyers, a tailor, a Jewish man up on Beale Street, and he made clothes for us.  I was just paying him about seventy-five cents a month.  Poor Ben would have starved to death if he had to rely upon us, but he was nice to us.  He was good to us, and I often think of him.  You know, he was a very nice guy, and he made our clothes.  By that time I could afford a suit, you know, a ridiculous-looking suit, but we were all dressed alike.
Story_ID: 18915
Speaker 1: And you start looking at photographs around that time, right?  You were saying, and you talk about looking through, you know -- that photographs were catching your eye.
Speaker 2: That was later when I became a -- actually when I was a busboy at the hotel. It was when Larry Funk's band picked me up, when they heard me play a song called, 'No Love,' and I was the busboy. And I was - one afternoon I had cleaned up the dining room.  Actually it was a love song for Sally [Alvis] because we'd broken up, and Larry Funk, who was sitting in the back of the room, heard me.  I didn't know he was there.  He said, "What were you playing?"  I said, "My song called 'No Love.'"  He said, "Your song?  You did that?"  I said, "Yes," so then he said play it again.  I played it, and he said, "Would you like for an orchestra to play that?" because the orchestra traveled, like Glen Gray's Casa Loma Band, and all of them traveled at the hotels and stayed for about three weeks, and they'd broadcast for the Mutual Broadcasting Company. And so me being a busboy here, this man's getting ready to play my music over the Mutual network.  I said, "Oh, my god, yes, I'd love it." So he called down two guys, and one took music down from my left hand, and the other one took the right hand.  In less than a week I heard my piece being played over the Mutual network. So he says you want to travel with us, just like that, and I said, "Oh, great," you know. Getting out of the hotel or being a busboy there, it was a big break for me.  Larry carried me with him for several weeks, went to Kansas City [Missouri], places like that.  He bought me a white suit with a belt wrapped around it.  I played in between the sets that they played on a little white piano he bought and traveled, and then I learned to play the theme song so well of the orchestra that I used to play their theme song to open up the broadcast, and that's how I got started with him.

Speaker 1: But when we got the next big engagement, it was a New York [New York] hotel -- Plaza, not -- in New York here.  Not the Plaza -- I forget the name of it, a big hotel that's still here, but I'll think of it in a moment. But my best friend in the orchestra was -- his name was Abby Fisher.  He's a Jewish guy, and he was a drummer, and he and I got to be very friendly.  I was the only black in the band and sort of a hero in Kansas City [Missouri] for the black orchestra just because I was the first black to be playing with awhite, all-white orchestra, you know. But when we got to New York, Larry had to come ahead of us, flown ahead of us, and we were coming in a bus, and Larry -- Fisher and I were approaching the hotel front door.  This was in New York City, and the doorman says, "You can't go in through the front."  Abby Fisher says, "Why can't he go in through the front?"  He says, "He's black.  He can't go in through the front.  He has to go around back.  This is New York City."  Abby says, "What the hell are you talking about?  He's a member of the band."  You know, Abby got really hot under the collar.  I said, aw, I said, "Abby, don't worry about it.  Don't get yourself in trouble.  We'll wait till Larry comes and let Larry fix it all up," but we didn't know Larry had skipped town, and the whole band was broke. And so I never will forget, Abby Fisher's family lived up in Brooklyn [New York] or someplace, so he says, "Oh, God, my family lives here.  I can make it.  I don't know what to tell you.  You ever been to New York before?"  I said, "No.  This is the first time I've been to New York."  Hadn't heard of Harlem. And so he said, "Well, I got about fifteen or twenty dollars.  I can give you that.  I can get home, but if I were you, I would go up to Harlem."  I said, "Okay, how do I get there?"  That's the first time I ever heard of it. And he said, "Well, you take the A train, and you get off at either 135th street or 145th" and so forth and so on. And he took me, put me on the train, told me goodbye, and gave me the fifteen or twenty dollars, and that's the last time I saw Abby.  Years and years later Abby was in the hospital dying, and he sent word for me that he needed some help, and I sent some money for the hospital and things.

Speaker 1: I know people have to have asked you this question, but did your piano skills -- did you say you were practicing, you know, you practiced as a child but, you know, when your mother [Sarah Parks] was still alive, but -- and then you played in the whorehouse, but how did they get, I mean -- so is this just natural talent?  Were you playing all the time, you know, because you're playing basketball here, then you go -- it's like right brain, left brain and it's like all of a sudden you're a compo -- I mean, this is, it's almost unbelievable is what it --
Speaker 2: Well, for me it's unbelievable, too, you know.  I don't know.  At first it was jazz.  I wasn't that great at strictly jazz piano, but I like the more melodic orchestras like Larry Funk's and Casa Loma Band, Kay Kyser, and that.  That came through the hotels.  I was a busboy, and I got a chance to hear them, and I don't know.  I just developed the piano to the extent that I was more inclined toward the classics, I suppose, but having had absolutely no training, it was difficult for me.  [Sergei] Rachmaninoff became my favorite eventually and still is, [Sergei] Prokofiev, Erik Satie, and some American composers, Duke Ellington and his area, and Duke used to say to me when we became friends that look, listen to these guys.  Listen to [Claude] Debussy.  Listen to the rest of them and so forth.  They got something to tell you.  Don't, you know, and so I listened a lot, and it just developed and developed and developed and still developed, and even to today I'm inspired by things they did, and I'm working on music for orchestra, for Yo-Yo Ma.  I want to do a piece for him, you know.  He wanted to play my work down in Atlanta [Georgia], but I only had eight minutes of cello work, and so if Yo-Yo is gonna play it, I want him to have three movements at least so I've got that in the back of my mind, and I'm working on a piece now that's inspired by Rachmaninoff.

Speaker 1: Seventh son of the seventh son.  What does your brother say about that?
Speaker 2: I guess he told me -- I told him about several times I have been to soothsayers, fortunetellers, and a lot of them have always refused to take money from me.  I said, "Why?"  This happened in Egypt, and I was with a young lady from the Paris Bureau of 'Life' magazine.  That's when I was with 'Life' and went to the hotel, and right after dinner this woman was coming around telling your fortune, and Gabby Smith -- was her name -- she was the reporter for 'Life.'  She said, "Oh, I don't believe in this stuff, but let's give it a try," and so I said, "Fine." So Gabby had a wedding ring on.  She put her hand on my hand, and she asked the fortuneteller, the woman, "How many more children will we have, and how long will it take before we have another child?" So the fortuneteller looked at her and said, "You don't really believe in me, do you?" And Gabby says, "What do you mean?"  She said, "You're not married to this gentleman, and you don't have two -- you have two children, but they're not his.  Is that all right?" And Gabby says, "You're right."  She said, "Do you want me to go on?  Are you gonna believe in me?" And Gabby said, "Yes," and, of course, she went on. And then afterwards she said, "Now about you.  Would you like me?"  I said, "Yeah."  She's already sold me, and so, "The main thing," she said, "I want to tell you.  I've never seen you before, and I don't know your name, but you're tremendously talented." And she said, "All of your talent is gonna come together in about five years."  I said, "Yes, what do you mean?"  She said, "You're multitalented.  You know that."  She said, "What you're gonna do is all coming together," so I waited for that.  I thought about it, what she was saying.  'The Learning Tree' came along, which I did the music.  I had to direct it.  I wrote the score for it.  She was right, you know. So I was telling my brother about this, and he said, "Well, don't you know why?"  He said, "This is the gypsies pay -- you know, wanting to pay off your mother [Sarah Parks] because when the gypsies used to come over our house in Fort Scott [Kansas], my father [Andrew Jackson Parks] would always want to run 'em out, and my mother said, 'No, they don't turn anybody hungry away from the house, Jackson,' and give the gypsies food." And by that time the doctors had said she wouldn't have anymore children, and one of the gypsies said, "You will have a child, and he's gonna be a very unusual child. Take my word." So my brother was telling me all this, and he said, "That's why the gypsies don't take your money," you know. And at least three times gypsies refused to take my money or soothsayers, soothsayers refused to take my money.

Speaker 1: You tell this whole story about, you know, buying your first camera and -- but you had already been intrigued at this point about taking photographs.
Speaker 2: I was a waiter on the railroad, and I saw the pictures of the Farm Security Administration photographers, and I thought they were wonderful photographs -- Dorothea Lange, John Vachon, Arthur Rothstein, some of the greatest documentary photographers of our time. And one of the magazines some rich person must have left on the dining car, and I saw the pictures in there, the Farm Security Administration in Washington [District of Columbia] where these photographers worked under Roy Stryker, and I don't know.  It made a big imprint upon my memory.  I couldn't forget them. So all the waiters on the North Coast Limited used to go out looking for women at night and so forth when we were on our layovers.  I was a little too young for that, and first of all, I had fallen in love with Sally [Alvis]. So I would visit the Art Institute on Michigan [Avenue] there in Chicago [Illinois], hang out there and go across the street to the Randolph Theater later on to see a movie and go back to the car where we had bunks in the dining car area and go to bed until we pulled out the next morning. So -- but one of these afternoons is when I saw Norman Allie's footage on the bombing of, of the American gunship, the (unclear), by the Japanese, and I was very impressed because over the intercom came the news that Norman Allie was in the theater and would be introduced right away. And he jumped out on the stage in a white suit and he got grand applause, and I thought that was marvelous.  I was very, very impressed. And then I got a, when I got to Seattle, Washington, I bought this cheap camera.  I think it was either twelve dollars and fifty cents or seven fifty, I can't remember which.

Speaker 1: The [Harlem] Globetrotters [basketball team] sent -- I have a thing they sent me, an honorary emblem.  I have it right in there.  They sent it to me a little while back to wear with this big number on it.  We [House of David Basketball Team] played the Globetrotters.  We beat the Globetrotters once.  They beat us about three times, you know, but we had a good team. (Unclear) was one of the greatest ball handlers I've ever seen in my life.  Nobody on the House, I mean, the other team I just mentioned was better than he was.  He was fantastic.
Speaker 2: Were there a lot of -- I mean, were there other teams like your, you know, like Globetrotters?  Were there -- was there a whole circuit at that time?
Speaker 1: We played mostly white teams. We played mostly white teams, booked all over the Northwest, played in Chicago [Illinois] a couple times, but the Globetrotters were the big name, and we were patterned after them.

Speaker 1: What made you attracted to the Art Institute [of Chicago, Illinois]?  Was that a place that people went?  Wasn't that a little unusual that you would go to the Art Institute or that wasn't?
Speaker 2: Was it what?
Speaker 1: Was it unusual that you would go to the Art Institute?  I mean, were there?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I don't really know why I went to the Art Institute.  I know that I -- oh, I think so.  I think I know why.  I took -- I bought this, this cheap camera I bought, I fell in Puget Sound [Seattle, Washington] trying to shoot seagulls, and I know the fishermen, they fished me out.  I was holding the camera in my hand.  When I got back to Minneapolis [Minnesota], I took my film to be developed because I didn't know how to develop it, and the guy from Eastman [later Eastman Kodak] asked me how long I'd been shooting, and I said, "That's my first roll." And he said, "You gotta be kidding me." And I said -- because he gave me contact prints.  He said, "These are very good." I said, "Well, thank you very much."  He said, "Keep it up.  We'll give you a show."  This was their shop on Fifth Street [Minneapolis, Minnesota] so I thought he was kidding me, but I kept it up, and sure enough they did give me a show.
Story_ID: 18922
Speaker 1: You tell the story about how you came to get, you know win the, win the Julius Rosenwald Fellowship, and I was wondering if you could just sort of retell that story quickly.
Speaker 2: Well, Peter Pollack and David Ross of the [South Side Community] Arts Center [Chicago, Illinois] encouraged me.  They had seen some of my work that I'd done on the South Side, and they encouraged me to apply for a Julius Rosenwald Fellowship.  They had never given the fellowship to a photographer before so I had my doubts, but I said, "Well, I'll try." So it was Horace Cayton -- I think his name was, at another community center there on the South Side, it was a black community center -- was the head of the Rosenwald committee for blacks, and he encouraged me, too. And he introduced me to a chap by the name of Billy Haygood who was with the [Julius] Rosenwald [Fund]. So they took my work, and they sent it to a jury of professional photographers in Chicago.  They were all white, and they turned me down. So Peter Pollack and both David were furious because they said, "Why would you send his work to photographers?  Why won't you just send it to artists and have some writers on this jury?" and so forth. So the Rosenwald people said, "Well, all right, we'll do that," and they sent my work back to a group of painters and writers, and there were one or two photographers on there, and I got unanimous approval.  Charles White had applied the same year, and Charlie and I were very good friends. And when I got mine, I was afraid Charlie hadn't got his.  Charlie had gotten his, and he was afraid I hadn't gotten mine so we called one another up.  Charlie says, "Well?"  I said, "I got it."  I said, "You?"  He said, "I got it," and we both got them at the same time the same year. And that's how the Rosenwald people wanted to know how I wanted to apprentice my period, and I said, "Oh, I would love to work with Farm Security [Administration]."  Oh no.  Jack Delano, a photographer from the Farm Security, was in town.  He saw my work, and he said, "You should come and work with the Farm Security Administration."  Well, that's the same photographers that I'd seen in a magazine.  I said it's impossible.  They won't accept me. And he said, "Well, I think Roy Stryker will take you on," you know. So they applied to Stryker.  He at first said, "Well, I like his work very much, but I don't wanna take him on here because this an all white southern laboratory, and they now accuse me of having glamour boys like the other photographers, glamour boys and glamour girls, and now you're gonna ask me to take on a black glamour gal -- guy for, for an all white southern laboratory."  He said, "It will never work." And so Billy Haygood said, "Gordon can take care of himself.  He's been through it all." And so Stryker said, "Okay.  Send him on," and so that's the way I got in.
Story_ID: 18923
Speaker 1: [Roy] Stryker played a very, very important role in your life at that time, not only working with you with the Farm Security Administration and the whole experience, Washington, but he was a good nurturer in a lot of ways.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, very good.  He taught me the important things, that your subject matter, no matter how destitute they are, learning the subject matter is the most important thing, not the famous cameraman whose name is spread all over the world but the people he photographed.  It's what he does with his camera when he's - and you must by any means research your story before, well before you go on to a story so when something happens instantaneously, you can immediately capture it.  If you have to stop and take a reading when you see something happening before you that's important, you're gonna lose the picture probably, and if you see all the other cameramen gathered around shooting this from this direction, go just the opposite way, you know?  This is what Roy used to tell us, and respect people.  Later on those teachings helped me when I went to photograph people who were poverty-stricken, say, in Harlem, the Fontanelles [photographed family].  I didn't even take a camera for a week.  I just got to know the people and the kids who were not in school because they didn't have the proper clothes or not eating half the time when the family was very impoverished.  I worked with them for about a week before I took the camera in, getting to be a big brother, and then when I got there, I could get anything I wanted.  That's happened in other instances.  That's what Stryker taught you, to have respect for people and their conditions and that, try to help 'em.  Don't just go do a big story for Life and have it published and then walk away and say well, I got ten pages and a cover.  You can't forget those people, and eventually even when I worked for Life magazine, the people became more important to me than the story and the life there.  Life would have probably fired me if they had known that, but that's why I was more or less successful because I became involved in the family.
Story_ID: 18924
Speaker 1: Do do you think, though, Mr. Parks, that's something you came across naturally because even when you look back at the things you shot in your early Chicago [Illinois] period, do you think -- do you see things that are missing from those early pictures because they seem to be -- you were able to get in with people close even at that point.
Speaker 2: Hmm.  Well, I don't know.  I just know that I knew what poverty was.  I knew what the situations were.  I had been reading Richard Wright and people like that, and I met Canada Lee who was a fine actor, Paul Robeson, and people like that eventually. So I was thinking in social terms already, now not becoming involved and not letting it get the best of my work and the way I used a camera and so forth.  I used it as a technician, never was much of a technician, still not today, you know. But it was mood, soul, feeling, you know.  What are you doing with the camera?  It was like Roy Stryker saying to me, "Don't pick it up to shoot pretty pictures." You know what I mean?  Take it up and let it become -- he was the first that, I suppose, to make me realize that the camera could be used as a weapon against discrimination and bigotry.  The very first picture ['American Gothic'] I shot at the Farm Security Administration has become their best-known picture.  You know,  I mean, something was happening.  I look at that picture today and say, "My god, why did I do that?"  You know, I was just coming to Washington [District of Columbia] for the first time.
Story_ID: 18925
Speaker 1: What made you decide that composition?  That's what's almost even amazing.  You know, I mean, what made you would put the things like that with the flag in the background.  Was that just, did you -- were you conscious of what -- you were somewhat conscious of what you were doing.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Having gone to the [South Side Community] Art Center in Chicago [Illinois], seeing some of the fine paintings and things for the first time in my life, I remember Grant Wood's 'American Gothic,' and I remember the guy with the pitchfork was standing with his wife in front of the barn and looking straight into the camera.  That picture stuck with me for some reason or another, the simplicity of it and the artfulness of it. So when I came - when I had suffered the discrimination in Washington [District of Columbia] the first day I was there, I was refused in Garfinkel's Department Store.  I was refused in a restaurant, refused in a theater, couldn't go in the white theater.  I was angry, you know, seething, you know, and I went back, and [Roy] Stryker knew that, and he had sent me on the assignment.  He knew it was gonna upset me, and he wanted to see how I would react to it, and I didn't know about Washington, D. C., in 1942 so he said, "Well, what'd you bring your camera down for?" when I told him.  He asked me, "How did it go?"  I said, "Well, you know how it went."  He said, "Well, what did you bring your camera down here for?"  I said, "Well, I don't know.  What's that got to do with it?"  He said, "You know, talk to some other black people down here, older people especially who've been through all their lives what you went through this afternoon and turn the camera against them.  Now you just can't photograph a bigot and write 'bigot' underneath his photograph 'cause bigots have a way of looking like anybody else and sometimes even better." He said, "So you have to get at the roots of bigotry.  Talk to some of the older people who've been through all their lives what you went through today," and he left and went home. And I was left in the office alone my first day there, 14th and Independence Avenue [Washington, D. C.].  The only person left was this woman sweeping the floor, a black woman and mopping.  She looked like a black woman, and I asked her name, and she told me her name. And I said, "Well, can you tell me a little about your life?" And there had been a lynching in her life.  Her daughter had died from childbirth, and she was now taking care of six kids, her kids on a salary that she couldn't hardly support herself on. So, I don't know.  Somehow or another Grant Wood popped in my mind.  I said, "Can I photograph you?"  She said, "Yes."  I said, "Where?"  She said, "Where do you want me to stand?"  I said, "Right in front of that American flag." And I said, "Have a broom in one hand and a mop in  the other." And I said, "Now look straight into the camera," and she did, and I took the photograph.  A few days later when Stryker saw it, he said, "Well, you got the right idea, but you're gonna get us all fired." (Laughter)  I thought the photograph had been destroyed, but I was coming back from -- 'cause a lot of southern congressmen and senators didn't like that picture being in the files of the government.  "It's an indictment," one guy said, "against America.  It shouldn't be in the file." So I thought it had been tossed out.  I got on a plane coming from D.C. -- California to New York, and right on the front page I see Ella Watson, you know from 'American Gothic,' and when I got off the plane here at LaGuardia [Airport, New York], instead of coming home here, I went straight down to Washington [District of Columbia], went to the Library of Congress which is where I found the picture was being kept, and had a negative made so it can never be destroyed.  It's in this house right now.
Story_ID: 18926
Speaker 1: I was asking you about the whole 'Life' [magazine] experience, why, you know -- how you think you really -- I know you tell the story, you know, and that you have this whole portfolio when you come in, but, I mean,  why do you think it really sort of -- was it because you were just that good?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that I possibly had some credentials that none of the other 'Life' photographers had inasmuch as I could shoot fashions, and I had been with 'Vogue' [magazine] for five years and was doing fashions for them.  Normally when we shot fashions for 'Life' in Paris [France], they would have to hire an outside photographer to do the collections, and I had been to Paris.  I had -- no, I hadn't been to Paris at the time when I first shot. But when they saw my work, I think they -- pardon me -- they saw that I could shoot fashions, and I could shoot crime and stuff of a documentary nature, sort of an all around thing here. And it would just be sort of a waste to let this guy out the door, you know, because I had been trained thoroughly in documentary and fashion by [Alexander] Lieberman at 'Vogue,' [Roy] Stryker at FSA [Farm Security Administration]. And furthermore the civil rights movement was on the move or coming up, and there were groups like the [Black] Muslims and the [Black] Panthers and the rest of 'em developing, and 'Life' wanted to get inside them, and they were trying with white photographers, but they couldn't do it.  I think that probably had some influence in their accepting me, but I really believe that Wilson Hicks, the picture editor, felt that "Here's this talent.  Let's explore," and they explored it.  They offered me a ridiculous fee for the first story I did, the Harlem gang story. But John Dailey, who was my editor, more or less, on the story, advised me to take it and also advised me that I would be on an unlimited expense account which made me a very wealthy photographer, right in the beginning. And then before long I was sent to Paris to do the French collections, and they were very successful. So it was a matter then of moving on, you know.
Story_ID: 18927
Speaker 1: I think it all came as such a surprise to me.  I think that 'Life' [magazine] sent me to Paris [France] two years after -- a year before -- right after I was on the staff, which usually you had to wait for five or six years before you were qualified to be sent to Paris or London [England] or some of the foreign bureaus.  They sent me the first, practically the first year I was there. And I often like to think, and I kid them now and then and say, "You didn't know what the hell to do with me when I was back in America so you sent me to Paris to cool off and to think about what you could do for me and how I could be used back in America." But (unclear) were fine.  Everybody backed me up to the hilt.  I never had any complaints from them.  When they did move us to Paris, my wife Sally, who always was somewhat concerned about my success here and this and that, that it would probably take me away from her.  She just never, ever grew to the point that she could trust just me and success, you know, and she took a dislike to Paris when she should have been loving it. And it was wonderful for the children [Gordon Parks, Jr; David Parks; Toni Parks Parson]. They went to French schools.  The oldest boy [Gordon Parks, Jr.] went to an American school, and we had a beautiful life there. But 'Life' magazine realized that my wife was unhappy there, pulled me back here before they normally would have, you know -- a little over two years they pulled me back -- because they didn't want to see a family break up, and they had a feeling that we were gonna have one. So they advised that I come back in about two years.  I would have probably stayed in Europe longer, but I did not want to become an expatriate by any means, you know.  Richard Wright and I had a talk at one time about my becoming an expatriate, and I said, "No, you know, Richard. I have things to do back here.  You did yours.  Now I have to go back and do mine." And I came back.

Speaker 1: Now who -- while you were there, you fell in love with Paris [France], though, didn't you, in many ways?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I call Paris my mistress.  Yes, I fell in love.  It's a beautiful place.  I liked the people, most of them.  I only experienced one incident that was close to racism.  A friend of mine wanted to get a place out in Neuilly where I lived, a black friend from New York, and asked me if I would intercede for him, and I looked in the newspapers, found a spot, told Natalie Contrabet, who was one of the reporters, about it and told her I'd inquired from the woman who was the owner, and she said yes, we have a beautiful place here, and so she said we'd be out in a half hour, and we got there, and the woman said this is for a friend of Mr. Parks and so forth and so on, that is Natalie did.  She said oh, but it's gone.  The place is gone in less than a half hour because she felt my friend would be black, and so Natalie was furious, and the woman began to cry.  She said come here.  I want to show you something, and I went through the house, came to a back courtyard, and there was a child out there playing, obviously a half-black, half-white, beautiful child, and she said that's my grandson.  That's my daughter's son, and I take care of him every day till my daughter gets back home and comes after him, and I love him more than I do anything else in the world, but she said the problem is in this house that I rent out, the American - a lot of people from  America, some of the people from the American embassy have told me that if I allow a black to come there that they're moving out so now what do you think of that?  She said that's why I'm afraid to let another black person, but that was the only incident that I remember during my whole period in Paris I came close to experiencing.
Speaker 1: Now what African-Americans were there at the same time that you were there?  Were there other - was - let's see.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  There were other - Richard Wright came.  I can't - a couple of painters.  Katherine Dunham had come through with her troupe or something of that sort.  Jimmy Baldwin hadn't arrived yet, but I didn't know too many of them.  There was a guy from - a writer from the Pittsburgh Courier, I think it was, came into town, but I was on the road most of the time throughout Europe, photographing everything from royalty to poverty and everything else.
Story_ID: 18929
Speaker 1: And what would you say was most significant about -- did you learn a lot from the Paris [France] experience?  Did it open up your - you learned from the FSA [Farm Security Administration].  Was there something you learned about that, from that Paris experience?
Speaker 2: When I went to Paris, I felt free as an artist for the first time, that I was not necessarily being taken as a black artist but just somebody who was pursuing achievements of some sort, you know.  I went to the (unclear) each Sunday which is the house where the great symphony orchestras came, and I would listen to symphonies, ballets, and things of that sort, and learn all cultural aspects that had escaped me, more or less, back in Kansas and places of that sort.  I was seeing it all for the first time, and it was a long way from Fort Scott, Kansas, to Paris. And a lot of things were happening with my children, meeting people, great writers and great artists. And I met [Marc] Chagall and other people like Pablo Neruda, the poet who I admire very much even today.  I met him in Rome [Italy]. And I learned an awful lot there in a cultural way about how to do things.  It almost was magical.  My first piano concerto was formed there.  I don't know why.  I think because I went to a bullfight in Spain and saw a young matador die at the hands of this bull, and it stayed with me.  I went back to Paris where I had kept a baby grand piano, started playing on it, and I don't know, just something from this bullfight and the death of this young bullfighter haunted me, you know. And so I started on my first piano concerto which I didn't know at the time it was gonna be a concerto.  Dean Dixon, who was a black conductor, would come to Paris because he couldn't get enough work in the United States but he was very well-respected in Europe.  He came to the house when I was playing and asked the maid not to disturb me, let me finish doing what I was doing. And after I finished he came in and said, "Ah," you know, "What was that?" And I was just kidding, I said, "Oh, that's my first piano concerto."  He said, "Yeah, let me hear some more of it." And so I said, "I was just kidding.  I was just noodling around."  I said, "it's really from, inspired by a bullfight that I saw up in Madrid [Spain]."  He said, "I like it."  He said, "If you finish it, I'll perform it with an orchestra in Venice [Italy] in a year and a half.  I'll be playing there." So I said, "Are you kidding?"  He said, "No, no."  He said, "We'll go get the tape machine, you tape it, and we'll send it back to Henry Brant.  They can orchestrate it back in New York [New York], and we're gonna do it in Venice." And that's what happened. So I worked off and on for the next year, taping and bringing parts of the music together, and that's when I first realized I could do a piano concerto. But Dean said (unclear).  I told him, I said, "You know I've had no training whatsoever in music."  He said, "It doesn't make any difference."  He said, "You're a good listener, and you must keep listening to your favorite composers, and even when you're talking to your maid or you're talking to your wife or you're angry with your children, keep listening to the good symphony music all the time, and keep it on in the house all the time." So that's what I did, and out of it came my first piano concerto, and I went to Venice to hear him when he performed it there at the Doge's Palace.
Story_ID: 18930
Speaker 1: And you went by yourself [to Venice, Italy].  Your wife wasn't with you at that time.
Speaker 2: No, I went by myself.  Sally had not brought herself around to accepting me, accepting my indulgence of things that would probably ruin our lives, as far as she was concerned.  It was not so, but she was that way.  She said, "I don't think you can afford to go.  You know, it's an expensive trip," so forth and so on. So I said, "Well, I have to go.  It's my first big work [piano concerto]." She said, "Okay," and just like that I went.  It was very successful.  I called her from Venice to White Plains [New York] where she had come back to.  "Well, I'm frying potatoes for your children.  Enjoy yourself." (laughter) So I kind of realized then that our life together was over, although we're still good friends.
Speaker 1: You were in love with her a great deal, though, weren't you?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was very much in love with her.  Yes.
Story_ID: 18931
Speaker 1: Of the things between crime and poverty and fashion, did you have any preferences between those two?  They're very, I mean,  two are really not so pleasant, and then the other is so like pristine and clean and pretty and then you're over here, people shooting themselves up and you know.
Speaker 2: Well, there's a vast difference in the approach to fashions as opposed to that of shooting a dead man or a dead boy or a kid shot by some of the gangs there or something of that sort, but you made the adjustment, and you made it as quickly as possible when you realized what you were there for. And especially in some of the more dangerous situations, you didn't have time to stop and figure out whether you're shooting fashions yesterday or whatever or you're shooting racing cars.  You're there now in a deadly situation where you can lose your life in a minute, and you do what you have to do.  I traveled with two detectives across America from New York [New York] all the way to San Francisco [California].  Well, I didn't stay with the two detectives, but I met two in Chicago [Illinois] who taught me an awful lot.  A guy can either be a cop or a priest, you know.  They're that slippery, and a guy told me once.  He said, "I could have been a priest if I wanted to.  I'm a cop," you know what I mean?  There are bad cops.  One asked me one day, he said, "Look, we're going there.  You want me to plug a guy for you or plug him?"  I said, "Don't do that for me.  I said if you have to protect yourself, that's you."  He said, "It will make a great picture."  I said, "No, not for me.  Don't plug anybody."  There were those kind of things.  Hank Sidam was a young reporter for 'Life' [magazine] who went with me.  He told me that first week we were out at Chicago [Illinois], he told me, "Gordon, I want to go home.  I can't take anymore." He said, "I just can't take anymore of this."  I said, "You gotta stay on Hank, you know.  I need you." And my first big approach was in Chicago. [Al] Capone had reigned and so forth and so on, and that was very dangerous. And went on to the violence in San Francisco where I was -- met guys on the death row, and one asked me if he was -- I was coming to see him die the next morning, and I didn't want to do it.  Hank said, "No."  I said, "Come on, Hank, we have to do it."  He said, "I like you, and I wish you would say a prayer for me and come and join, join the group when they come to see me go tomorrow morning."  I said, "Okay, I'll go," and he was in the gas chamber. And they had moved me within four or five feet of the chair if you were looking at the glass.  I stood there, and I think they moved me at the last minute or something because they felt that I might have a camera concealed someplace and they wanted to watch me, you know. So then the guy came in.  They brought him in, and he looked at me, and he had tears in his eyes, and I told him I'd say a prayer for him. And just before they dropped the pellet, he asked for a Bible, and they gave him a Bible, and I was close enough to tell what he was thumbing through, like the different Proverbs [from the Book of Proverbs] and so forth and so on.  He was just thumbing.  He was killing time.  He didn't want to die right away, but the guard told him through the intercom let it go, and he did, and the warden dropped, had the pellet dropped.  Gas came up, and he went out.  You could see his nervous system being destroyed.  Well, that was enough for me, and I wanted to go home, you know, too. And I remembered that I could have wound up in that chair, you know, 'cause of all the things I'd been through.  It looks like all the violence that I had ever seen in my life was propping me for that moment when I walked out of that gas chamber. So there was times in life when I look back now and realize I'm a lucky guy to be here.
Story_ID: 18932
Speaker 1: You know, I did a story there [at 'Life' magazine] on what happens in America every morning.  People don't know realize that it happens right today.  There are planes going up looking at our borders.  There are submarines out looking at our borders so that there's no enemy approaching every day, and I was given this assignment through the Air Force and went up.  They sent me up with four pilots, four jets, and I was in the fifth jet, and since we had to have extra fuel, ran out of fuel, and my pilot said we gotta drop.  You're gonna go out.  Sure enough, we dropped.  The plane turned over and dropped, and I went out.  I didn't come to until we were on the runway, and it was -- the stress was too much.  Then I got -- once a submarine, I was doing a thing on the submarines in vigil and the mourners outside of the areas around New Jersey and a little further out. But it was these battleships and things were coming in, and I wanted the periscope to poke just above the water.  I was in the submarine, and I wanted to attach my camera to the periscope to shoot ships coming and then dive.  Well, the guy who was in charge of the submarine, knowing that there was a 'Life' [magazine] photographer aboard, he wanted to be at the periscope.  He'd never been there before.  He insisted to his major, and he panicked and dove too quickly, and there was still two guys on deck who had never been -- he said, "Dive."  You got two guys on the deck, and you're hollering "dive." And so his assistant ran up knocked him out of the way and said, "Hold it, hold it." Because down the stairs beneath us they don't know that these two guys are on deck. So the guys ran to get them.  We had to get them in.  The water was already coming in.  We would have all died in a matter of minutes because the water was coming in on us, you know. But we pulled them in, slammed down the hatch, and they were soaking wet, scared to death, and naturally they had a (unclear) because they were just minutes from death. And we were minutes from death. And I think back at the Russian submarine recently.  I said, "My God.  I remember that terrible situation."  Things like that you look back.  At the time you're doing 'em, it's not that frightening, but it's after you look back sometimes.  "Oh my God, you know.  How did I survive it?"
Story_ID: 18933
Speaker 1: When you did the film ['The Learning Tree'], when you had the chance to do the film, was this a whole new opportunity sort of opening up, and was it a way of doing, you know, telling, being a documentary but in a different way or being a novelist but in a different way?
Speaker 2: Well, I never had any dreams for, that I would direct it.  I know there were people, a couple of guys at 'Life' magazine wanted to do the film, and they had tried to get the money and so forth and so on, but they were unsuccessful.  John Cassavetes called me, the actor, from Hollywood [California] one night and said that he read the novel and thought that I should, that they should make a film of it.  I said, "Well, fine, John, go ahead," you know.  He said, "No, I think you should direct it."  I said, "Well, look there are no black directors in Hollywood, and there are not gonna be any, John, and you know that."  He said, "Can you come out tomorrow about this, day after tomorrow?"  I said, "Yeah."  "Well," he said, "Come on and ask for Kenny Harman, and I'll be there -- but Kenny and I are not speaking, but I'll introduce you and leave."  That's what happened. And Kenny Harman, the first thing he said to me was, "Which book would you want to do first: 'The Learning Tree' or 'Choice of Weapons?' And I said -- I thought he was kidding me, of course.  At least I thought it was Hollywood hype, you know, and I said, "Well, I wrote 'The Learning Tree' first.  That would be my first choice." So he said, "Well, who would you like to write the screenplay?" And I said, "I don't know anyone out here."  He said, "Why don't you write the screenplay?  You wrote the book."  I said, "Okay," just like that, fine.  I still didn't believe him. And then he said, "Cassavetes tells me you're a composer.  Why don't you do the music?"  I said, "Why not?" you know. And then he said, "Since you're gonna be the first black director working out of a major Hollywood studio, we think you should produce it because you're gonna have to have a lot of clout, and you have to be the boss." And I said, "Well, okay with me." And he asked me who my agent was, and I told him Bobby Lance in New York, and they arranged it, and three days later it was announced across the nation that I was gonna direct it.
Story_ID: 18934
Speaker 1: I have two films in that category.
Speaker 2: Well, 'Shaft' is in a class by itself in many ways.  It started a whole new genre of film in many ways.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Um hmm.
Speaker 1: Um hmm.
Speaker 2: But how did that come about, 'Shaft'?  How did it come about?
Speaker 1: They just called me, asked me if I'd like to read a script, MGM [Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios], and I suggested it on. And they sent me a script, and I read it, I didn't like it. And they said well, would you like to direct it and work on the screenplay, and I said -- well, (unclear) Ernest Tidyman wrote -- supposedly wrote the book, but there was some problem about whether a black kid wrote it and Ernest Tidyman took it from him or stole it from him. But in any case, the studio straightened that out, and got John D. F. Black, a young writer out there who I felt had more of a touch, and he did it, and I approved the screenplay and the -- MGM approved it, and we were ready to go.  The next thing was to find an actor, and I found Richard Roundtree by accident almost, and we were on a roll.  I didn't think the film was gonna be that successful.  You know, I expected an ordinary run.  I never thought it would do what it did.  It opened up in New York [New York].  I didn't even go to the opening.  I was home, and David, my son, was up there, and they called and said -- 3:00 -- David said, "Dad, you better get up come up here."  I said, "What? It's 3:00, David."  He said, "I know, but the show is still running.  They can't close it down, and people are around the block." And I went up there. And so obviously we had a great success going from the very beginning.  They couldn't close the show down for three days because people -- the crowds kept coming, you know. And Jim Aubrey who was the head of MGM asked me to take it to London [England] for people to see and the press. And I said, "Well, they're not gonna understand this film in London."  He said, "Well, we have to take it anyway, you know, so let's go."  I said, "Okay, let's go, Jim."  Got there, the press saw it.  There was three women in the room so one of the reporters said, "Really what does 'Shaft' mean really, you know?"  So I said, "Well, it means sort of 'up yours.'" And he said, "Oh, and those blokes going around calling one another 'mother, mother.'" So one of the women said, "I can tell you what it means.  You've heard of mother's 'Smucker's Jam?'  You know what I mean?  Well, this Smucker's without an S." (laughter) One of the women said that.  I said, "Thank you very much for explaining this to him." And so it was naturally very successful in England when it opened.  I happened to be over in England when it opened.  They were around the block over there. And I was in Rome [Italy] once, and it was playing there in Rome. And it's been that way all over.  It still plays big, you know.
Story_ID: 18935
Speaker 1: I want to talk now about 'Half Past Autumn' and how that whole project came about.
Speaker 2: You mean the film?
Speaker 1: The film, the book, the book -- I mean, the exhibit, and then the film.
Speaker 2: Well, the Corcoran [Museum of Art] in Washington [District of Columbia] contacted me and asked me if I would consider, you know, an exhibition. And I respected the Corcoran, and I said, "Yes, I sure would." And I said, "But I would need a lot of help to get it put together." And he said, "Well, we'll give you help.  The curator, Philip Brookman, will come up during the week and help you with selections and things, sizes and things of that sort." So that's what they did. And meanwhile publishers were wanting me to do a retrospective book, my publishers. And so I had decided on 'Half Past Autumn.' And later on when HBO [Home Box Office Channel] did the film, hour and a half film on me, they thought that was a good title so they all fed off that title. But I picked it from amongst about ten or twelve titles that I write out and look at them, digest them, and I finally arrived at 'Half Past Autumn.'  I know why actually.  I think in, of life, my life, at least, in terms of seasons.  I figured I've lived out spring, summer, and now autumn coming, half past autumn, and then, at last, winter. And that's how that title came about.
Speaker 1: It's a beautiful title.
Speaker 2: Um hmm.
Speaker 1: And the poem, did the poem come first?  The poem?  The writing.  Well, it's not a poem but the introduction, the poem.
Speaker 2: I had a poem?  Well, I wrote a poem for my father [Andrew Jackson Parks] in there and a poem about Kansas, living in Kansas.  No, I think the poem was already written.
Speaker 1: It was -- okay.  It's a beautiful -- it's a beautiful title.
Speaker 2: Now have you been surprised by the response to the documentary?
Speaker 1: I was very surprised about the documentary success.  It's been nothing but good re -- good reviews.  We worked hard on it.  It took a lot out of me that I didn't expect it to, you know, to get the praises you get. But I welcome it.
Story_ID: 18936
Speaker 1: At this point in your life what haven't you done that you would like to still do?
Speaker 2: I think the only regret that I possibly could have about what I would have done -- like to build more.  I'd like to do everything I'm doing better, for one thing.  I'd like to write better, photograph better, paint better, write better poetry, and so forth and so on. But if I were given druthers, if I had my druthers and if Providence would will me just two things to do, I think I'd probably compose on the piano and write poetry, the sort of self-sustaining things that I'm talking to the world the way I want to talk and say things the way I want to say them, nobody bothering it with a pencil.  Maybe a conductor has a suggestion or maybe some editor would.  They would very seldom bother my poetry.  They -- the novels and things like that, you'd have an editor right on your back all the time. But I think perhaps if I had it all to do again, I would love to become a concert pianist 'cause I have a talent, and some things I play now that a concert pianist would find difficult to play because I worked at it, you know. But I think that possibly is the one thing that I wish that I had done differently.  I wished I had studied.  Right now I write in a very weird form.  Nobody can understand it but me.
Story_ID: 18937
Speaker 1: What ties all those together -- the poetry, the music, the photography, the filmmaking?  What is the string that sort of ties them all together?
Speaker 2: Well, the poetry ties it all together for me.  I want everything I do to be filled with poetry, whether it's music or whether it's a photograph or whatever.  It has to have poetry in it for me.  That's why poetry is so important for me.
Speaker 1: And is there a poem or a few lines of your favorite poem that you could recite right now?
Speaker 2: No.  My son-in-law from London [England] sent me a poem I had written when we went to the Middle East when [George H. W.] Bush was President, and he opened up with a few lines.  I said, "God, those are wonderful lines.  Whose are they?"  He said, "They're yours, and this is from a poem you wrote."  I said, "Oh, I remember," and so he sent me the poem. And I hadn't had a chance to go through it, but it was a poem on the Middle East.  I wish I could recite it, but I can't recite my poetry.  I can read it, but it was something like a line something like, "All is not quiet in Bethlehem tonight," or something like that.  It was when they restarted to bomb over there, and, I don't know, and the lines from some of it were very good.  It was read over there and published, but I don't know what I did with the original.

Speaker 1: And I have one question I ask of everyone, but what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I don't really know what I want my legacy to be.  I want people to remember me for what I've tried to do for humanity.  I feel as though we're all allowed a certain time upon this planet, and we should do what we could while we're here to improve it so when we leave it, we've left something for someone else, and that's what I try to do. And I have -- my greatest regret perhaps is that my mother [Sarah Parks] and father [Andrew Jackson Parks] are not alive to see what I was trying to accomplish from their teachings. And I think that the greatest word in the history of human language is "love."  If we could all just realize that, it would be a greater world.  Okay.
Speaker 1: And if your mother [Sarah Parks] could see you, if she could see you, what do you think she would say?
Speaker 2: "Well, you did it," probably.  "Well, I see you did it.  Okay.  Keep on going."  That's what she'd say.  "Don't stop."  My father [Andrew Jackson Parks] would just shake his head, put his corncob pipe in his mouth and go off to feed the hogs.
