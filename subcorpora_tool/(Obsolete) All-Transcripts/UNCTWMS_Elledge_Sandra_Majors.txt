David Cline: -- be with someone who knows the ropes. [Laughs]
Sandy Elledge: Well I don&#8217;t know that I know the ropes but I&#8217;m pretty used to ignoring microphones.
DC: Okay, so we can do that, great.  So today is--.  Of course I&#8217;m going to forget what today&#8217;s date is.  It is May--
SE: It&#8217;s the 19th.
DC: --the 19th, 2010, and this is David Cline for the Southern Oral History Program and I am in Knoxville, Tennessee today, and if  you would introduce yourself?
SE: I am Sandra Majors Elledge.  Job title, simply because we all seem to go with our job titles, I am retired executive director of Episcopal Appalachian Ministries and now happily involved with being a grandmother.
DC: Wonderful. [Laughs] Well I&#8217;d like to start this by asking you to talk a little bit about where you were raised and your people and your background to get a sense of what you came from that may have then led you to the work that you ended up doing.
SE: I am a native Texan.  My family moved a great deal.  My mother was a public health nurse back in the days when public health nurses traveled from place to place.  She traveled mainly in Arkansas and East Texas.  I&#8217;ve always said that I come by my activism very honestly because Mother was one of the ones who fought so hard to be sure that wells were capped in Texas, because I can remember when I grew up at least once a summer some kid fell in a well and drowned.  She was also one that while she was director of nursing education at the University of Texas tried to work with the local school systems and got the Austin, Texas school system to agree that all of the Mexican kids could have the breakfast under the federal lunch program that was much more of their ethnic liking, so that they could actually be served beans and rice and tortillas, which are much healthier for them than bacon and eggs, and the kids like it better.
DC: So how do you think she came by her activism?
SE: Oh, she was the very youngest of thirteen children, three sets of twins, and I think it was just to survive. [Laughs] I don&#8217;t know because my grandparents died long before I was born so I, you know.  I would imagine it would be hard to have been a public health nurse back in the mid &#8217;30s during the height of the Depression without becoming an activist.  We never talked about it in those terms.
DC: Right, but as you look back on it, yeah.  What year were you born?
SE: I was born in 1941.
DC: And so raised in Texas, and then?
SE: Raised in Texas, back and forth a great deal, Houston, Austin.  I had health problems so they moved me to a drier climate; spent some time in Arizona and some time in Washington State.  Now why Washington State [was considered a] dry climate? [Laughs]
DC: It doesn&#8217;t sound dry to me, right.
SE: But all the summers in East Texas and my grandparents&#8217; cotton farm.  I think I was always kind of a crusader.  I remember there was something that I was so incensed about when I was about seven that the government didn&#8217;t let us do that I thought we should, and I don&#8217;t remember what it was, and my mother said offhandedly, &#8220;Well, if you feel that strongly about it write a letter to your Congressman,&#8221; and I did, and for years carried the letter around with me.  Was married to an Air Force officer and we moved every three years so I&#8217;ve moved about forty-three times in my lifetime and things have a tendency to just kind of disappear.
DC: Right.  Can you remember as a young adult, or as an adult, any particular issue that first got you started?
SE: My high school class was one of the first to be integrated.
DC: And that was where?
SE: Austin High School.
DC: In Austin, okay.
SE: And I remember some of the hullabaloo about it.  We certainly didn&#8217;t have anything like most places but there was some unpleasantness and it was mainly the personal kind of unpleasantness and I used to rail about that some of the time.  Then as I say I was married to an Air Force officer who was serving in Vietnam and the base commander was not happy with me when I got arrested for anti-war protests.
DC: [Laughs] Right.  And where was that?
SE: That was in Las Vegas, Nevada, at Nellis Air Force Base.
DC: How did your husband feel about your being in the anti-war protests?
SE: He basically agreed with me.  He was an intelligence officer and one of the reasons he really believed in what he was doing was because he thought if people knew the truth the truth would make them free and if we really knew and understand each side then things would be better.  And it ended up that he was-- when I say he was dismissed that&#8217;s not exactly true because that seems to be a section eight or a dishonorable discharge and that was not the case at all, but at the end of the Vietnam War they were thinning the ranks and because he had a couple of bad OERs, officer efficiency reports, simply because he had been one of the ones who--.  He was head of the Cambodia desk and he gave some briefings to General Westmoreland that were not popular.
DC: Right.
SE: True, but not popular, and was written up for it, so he was let go of the service and that was fine with him because he felt a real call to seminary.
DC: Fascinating.  So where did you end up then?
SE: Sewanee.
DC: Okay, yeah.
SE: Would have liked to have gone to CDSP at Berkeley but the Air Force would only move you as far as your home of record and our home of record--we were in Germany at the time--our home of record was Austin, Texas so they would move us--. [Break in recording]
DC: So it is--. [Laughs] A little technical difficulties, but this is David Cline again and it&#8217;s May the 19th and we&#8217;re starting the second track here with Sandy Elledge.  To get back where we were, which was--.
SE: Do you need the mic plugged into it for the--?
DC: No.  It&#8217;s recording right off of here.
SE: Okay.
DC: This is--.  Yeah, it&#8217;s actually a little bit cleaner.  Okay.
SE: But long story short, sort of a limited church background.  None of the churches I visited seemed to be very activist.
DC: And just to get back to where we were, you said your mother was Roman Catholic, is that right?
SE: Right, but she felt rather unwelcome as a divorced woman with a child in the mid &#8217;40s, you know, so there was not much church background except I went with any neighbor that would take me, but it was probably not ever the same person two Sundays in a row, except at my grandparents because my granddad was an elder in the Christian Church, Disciples of Christ.  Joined the Methodist Church just before I got married because my spouse at that time was Methodist; we later became Episcopalian.  Don&#8217;t think it ever occurred to me that churches could be activist.  That was in the 1950s.
DC: And how did you learn that [Laughs] this was possible?
SE: Became an Episcopalian. [Laughs]
DC: Yeah.
SE: Was basically how--.  While we were overseas of course we were active in the chapel program but certainly in military chapels you didn&#8217;t have any activism.
DC: Can you point to a particular congregation or pastor that really sort of awakened you to this possibility?  You talked about the shift being to the Episcopal Church and I&#8217;m curious if there was a--.
SE: I think probably it was not really any congregation.  It was just seminary itself and reading the gospels and seeing that it wasn&#8217;t all just you and me, Jesus.
DC: Mm hmm.
SE: And that if you really believe the gospels and want to act them out then there are certain things you have to do.  Certainly my former spouse set a very good example of that in the ways he tried to lead his congregation.  Not big, big things; they were reasonably small congregations in places like Jasper, Alabama, which are very conservative, but such things as having a woman who had been in the church for sixty years--.  He had never met her--it was right after we moved to Ohio--but the former pastor or rector of that congregation had been listed as her contact at the nursing home and when she died there was no family and there was no one to do a funeral.  There were a couple of people in the church who remembered her because she had sung in the choir thirty years ago.  So, he held her funeral during the Sunday service because everybody should have somebody to say goodbye to them.  It was a good way to talk about caring for people.  So just those kind of examples, and then I grew into a lot of it in my work with EAM [Episcopal Appalachian Ministries] and particularly with CORA [Commission on Religion in Appalachia].
DC: We had talked just a little bit off tape about how segregated churches can be and are and you mentioned an experience in Alabama.  I wonder if you could tell me a little bit about that.
SE: Well, one of the seminarians in Sewanee was a friend of ours and he had been hired at--.  It was one of the work boys--and that was not meant pejoratively; that&#8217;s what they were called at that time--at the farm at McDowell Camp and Conference Center and also did, I think, some work with the kids during the summer, and that was a pretty standard thing that seminarians did.  He was African American.  At that time they were being called black because this was &#8217;77.  We asked him to come out and have dinner with us after church and come to church with us, didn&#8217;t think a thing of it.  I mean if we had thought anything about it we would never have invited him because we would not have wanted him to be embarrassed, but we didn&#8217;t think anything about it.  So he went to church with us, came up for communion, he and I sat on the second or third row, I went up for communion, he was in front of me, I had communion and I turned around and nobody came up after me.  They were not going to take communion after a black man.  A couple of sermons followed.  I believe there was even a letter to the bishop complaining about the incident and the bishop basically saying, well good for John for doing that.  That was at the same time that one of the leaders of the congregation had a son who was at Canterbury House in Tuscaloosa, the University of Alabama, and the senior warden was complaining that nearly all of his son&#8217;s housemates were African American, or were black, but that it was all right because they were from Africa.
DC: [Laughs] All right.
SE: That didn&#8217;t go over very well with either of us.  There was some conversation about how many blacks there were in the church and so on and a little distaste with it and hope that it didn&#8217;t spread.  So we were very glad to leave Jasper after four years and they were just as glad to have us leave.
DC: [Laughs]
SE: It was just not a good marriage.  It was a good growing time, and I hope and I do believe they have grown.
DC: From that point.  That&#8217;s very fascinating to me, 1977.
SE: Well we&#8217;re still--10:00 to 12:00 are still the two most segregated hours of the [week].
DC: Right.
SE: Even here in Knoxville, unfortunately.
DC: Even [among] people of good will, and I don&#8217;t know why it is so.  I&#8217;m curious if you have a theory.
SE: No.  A lot of good African American friends tell me that they&#8217;re not going to push it for the most part, simply because, particularly as far as the Episcopal Church is concerned, that&#8217;s not their way of worshiping.  I mean it&#8217;s--.
DC: There&#8217;s definitely a cultural piece to it, yeah, right.
SE: And a couple of them have said: Hey, I have to fight those battles every day at work or at school.  When I go to church I just want to be comfortable, and so even though I could go to a predominantly white congregation, why would I want to?
DC: Yeah.
SE: Yeah.  I mean so it&#8217;s kind of a two-way street but that&#8217;s not to let us off the hook.
DC: Right.  So when you did come to Appalachian Ministries, can you remember what the major issues were at that time?  What was the organization doing?
SE: Well, [in] 1983, the major issues were of course economic justice for the Appalachian region, and a lot of environmental things, and the boom and bust coal cycle.  At that point EAM had three different ministry units, which are sort of departments if you want to use that.  There was a sort of a think tank of how to present issues, how to be involved in educating the church, and there was an urban unit.  It seems really strange now to think back that at that point in a lot of congregations such things as after school programs and soup kitchens were new.  We had been prosperous enough in the &#8217;50s that except in the big, big cities the churches really didn&#8217;t see any need to get involved in that sort of thing, and we were having a downturn and people were beginning to say, hey, we&#8217;ve got a tremendous homeless population.  We&#8217;ve got hunger.  We&#8217;ve got latchkey kids all over the place.
DC: So by 1983 you&#8217;re really seeing these expressions of poverty.
SE: Mm hmm, and so we had an urban unit that began to work with local urban churches in the Appalachian region or among the Appalachian migrant centers, Chicago--not Chicago; not in the Appalachian region--Dayton, Cincinnati, to a certain extent Charleston, [West Virginia] although it is still in the Appalachian region, Charlotte, North Carolina, a lot of the places along the fringe that were migrant centers.
DC: Right, urban areas where people migrated to.
SE: And then we had a ministry unit on small church work, how to help small churches be involved in their communities.  It all really kind of worked together, sort of the way you were talking about social justice issues.  You may focus one way but there&#8217;s an overarching--.
DC: Right, there&#8217;s overlap between the units.
SE: And so most of the time I&#8217;ve not done what you&#8217;d really call direct service.  We have been a coordinating and a resource organization for the thirteen dioceses that we served.
DC: Yeah, if you could sort of paint me a little bit of a picture and tell me how the organization functions and what the regional scope is -- the Appalachian region that you cover -- and how you work with those guys.
SE: Well at one point we had thirteen dioceses.  We&#8217;re down now to ten and in some ways we have kind of worked ourselves out of some of that because all of the dioceses now recognize the need for urban ministries and nearly every urban church is heavily involved in outreach ministries.  Most of the dioceses now understand that small churches aren&#8217;t just miniature versions of big churches and that particularly the small rural churches have different sets of challenges and they began to factor that into their working and their resources.  And there are not nearly the national resources to help funnel to some of these other places that there used to be.
DC: Right.  So say when you started this work what were those national resources?
SE: There was a Jubilee Fund; there was the Presiding Bishop&#8217;s Fund for World Relief, which still is in existence.  It&#8217;s now called Episcopal Relief and Development and it focuses more on international and emergency work than it does on grants to places for ministry.
DC: Right, but in those days it did.
SE: But in those days.
DC: Right.
SE: And then there was a Venture in Mission Fund that was a special capital campaign that had just been run.  We had a lot of money that we could give away as grants from it, and there was a Human Development Fund.  None of those exist at this point.
DC: And why is that?
SE: The Church has fallen on hard times.  There&#8217;s a great deal of talk about doing more locally, which we always did.  It just means you don&#8217;t have to fund it from a national pool.
DC: Got it.
SE: But it doesn&#8217;t mean there&#8217;s as much money.
DC: Right.  But you were always doing work on a local level, obviously.
SE: Right, or we were always sort of the intermediary that helped people do so.
DC: Do the work, right.
SE: The national grants could not be given to community organizations, in other words non-church organizations, which is why we were so heavily with CORA, and that was how I met Bill Troy because he was the resource coordinator for CORA and he and I worked together.  I was his contact to funnel Episcopal funds into CORA for grants to projects throughout the region.
DC: Just for the purpose of the tape, can you introduce CORA, what CORA stands for?
SE: CORA is Commission on Religion in Appalachia, and it grew out of the Ford Foundation report back in the mid &#8217;60s.  Part of the government--the churches&#8217; response to the War on Poverty, but its primary purpose was always to be the intersection between church resources and grassroots community movements.  None of the churches were willing to give money to grassroots groups but by coming together as CORA we then became a legitimate agency for them so that the churches would pool the money and CORA was given the oversight of making sure reports were in, criteria were met.  In fact the Episcopal Church was one of the founders of the Appalachian Development Projects group, which was the organization that decided how these grants would be spent.  The director of APSO [Appalachian People&#8217;s Service Organization] took something like twenty proposals to a Presiding Bishop&#8217;s Fund for World Relief granting session and the group said we don&#8217;t know how to evaluate these.  There are too many of them.  We don&#8217;t know how to have the oversight.  They just seem so far removed because we&#8217;re used to dealing with church groups.  And so CORA set up a group that had representatives from all the member denominations and grassroots groups to decide on the criteria, to decide on the reporting cycle, with meeting the guidelines the Church set out, of course, and then to review and disburse these grants and oversee them, as well as offer some technical assistance because back in the late &#8217;60s many of the church groups, particularly some of the women who founded some of the very small projects that filled such a need in their local communities, didn&#8217;t have the--I guess the word is sophistication, the knowledge, to write the kind of grant proposal that church organizations were used to dealing with.
DC: Just then you said women working in these small organizations.  Was it mostly women?
SE: Oh, yeah.  When I first started nearly all of them were women.  Most of them were started by women, and one of the things we had a lot of trouble trying to get across to the church, because they were used to dealing in more urban areas because those were the churches that had the resources to do things.  I remember one of the proposals we were reviewing, they had had a hotline, a battered women&#8217;s hotline, in a rural Tennessee area and they had had seventeen calls in a month and they thought they were doing wonderfully.  Well you have to remember in the mid &#8217;70s there was still in the rural areas in much of the South the idea that men could do anything they wanted to their wives.  They were their wives.  And a wife that had the nerve to call a hotline was really taking a risk, so to get seventeen hotline calls in a month was, I thought, astounding.  And the woman said but at the one in Detroit we get seventeen hundred a month, and so I had to go through the whole cultural milieu and the fact that everybody knew everybody else and it was so much harder to have a safe place in a small area where everybody knew everybody and everybody knew everybody&#8217;s business.
DC: Right, so you had to translate that for--
SE: Yeah.
DC: --those higher up the chain.
SE: And I wasn&#8217;t the only one who did that; a lot of people did it.  But that was started by a woman who had finally managed to make that break, and when she came back home to take care of her parents she saw that the problem was still there, and she started it with almost nothing.
DC: And started it through a church or was it extra-church?
SE: Sort of extra-church in that she talked the rector of the church into letting her use the church&#8217;s phone number.
DC: Got it, yeah.
SE: Because that was a safe thing.  And eventually they needed to make that separation so the church paid for the phone line, you know, twenty-five dollars a month or something of that sort, just very, very tiny but such a good example of what one woman seeing a need and [loud sound] this rector until he finally said, I would have given her the twenty-five dollars a month just to get her out of my office. [Laughs]
DC: [Laughs] Right.
SE: So almost any congregation, no matter how it struggles, can do some of these kinds of things.
DC: Can you think of some other examples?  I&#8217;m thinking particularly of women who started projects, just ones that you recall.  Is there any particular example?
SE: Well of course if you talk to Marie Cirillo she will tell you about several.  I don&#8217;t remember.  So many of these I heard about and knew about twenty-five years ago, and I&#8217;m too rusty on details and I&#8217;m afraid that if I say one person did, she may have been one of the spearheads but you never do anything in a vacuum.
DC: Right.
SE: And I don&#8217;t want to forget those who maybe just gave her moral support. [Pause] I think that probably--.  I know there are a couple of women&#8217;s shelters that women have been--and food pantries, and some of the after school programs, but I can&#8217;t give you specifics right at the moment.
DC: No problem.
SE: The minute you walk out the door--
DC: Of course. [Laughs]
SE: --I will think of five or six.  One of the things that I haven&#8217;t talked about with EAM, because it came a little later, we&#8217;ve always said that our ministry fit our name, education, advocacy, and mission, and much of what EAM did and what I have done--.  My board of governors used to call me an Episcopal tour guide.  I&#8217;m a great believer that if you tell people of the need they will respond, and to me a picture is worth a thousand words, so I was always organizing tours of this group of women or that group of women, Episcopal Church Women or a diocesan group, any sort of ministry team to come and visit some of the ministry sites in Appalachia, and to see and to talk with people, not the kind of tour that you drive by six little shacks and say, oh, ain&#8217;t it awful, because to me that&#8217;s exploitation and I will not countenance [that], but really getting to know people.  And so another just sort of organic extension of that was when I came to EAM they had a youth program and they did mission trips, work camp opportunities, which were wonderful, but as our funding got cut back that was one of the programs that disappeared.  And when we kind of reinvented ourselves after our government--.  At one point our program was cut ninety thousand dollars a year.
DC: Ooh!
SE: So we had to reinvent ourselves very quickly.
DC: Right.  What had your budget been?  I mean what percentage was that?
SE: It was almost half.
DC: Half of your budget, yeah.
SE: Maybe not quite but almost, and we went from five staff people to two--no, at that point two and three quarters.  Somebody said why don&#8217;t you do work camps again, and we did a pilot one and it worked very well, and one of the young people said, &#8220;Well do they have an APSO for adults?&#8221;  I said, &#8220;What?&#8221;  They said, &#8220;Well do adults get to go to work camp?&#8221;  So I said, hmm, let&#8217;s try an all adult work camp, and it was so much fun and so wonderful that we decided, hey, we&#8217;d do intergenerational work camps.
DC: Oh, very nice.
SE: And our work camps are kind of where the rubber meets the road, where the advocacy and the education actually become ministry, and we don&#8217;t take any more than five or six people from any one congregation because we work primarily with the smaller churches or individuals who can&#8217;t join a big group, so that means we have our own staff to do everything and we have an educational component.  We use some of the popular education exercises that were developed, some of them, at Highlander and some from CORA&#8217;s project EAR, Economics in the Appalachian Region, or as Jerry Bone, who was the staff person, used to say, &#8220;Economics as if people mattered.&#8221;  We screen the families pretty carefully so that they understand that they&#8217;re inviting people into their homes and all of our work campers understand that they are there as guests.  As important as the work is, to make homes warm, safe, and dry--.
DC: So the major project is home--.
SE: Home repair.
DC: Home repair, okay.
SE: And sometimes to let those who would fall through the safety net--.  You know there&#8217;s that group that has almost enough to pay for the materials but they can&#8217;t pay for the materials and the labor, and so sometimes we&#8217;ll let them buy the materials and we&#8217;ll do the labor.
DC: You&#8217;ll do the labor, right.
SE: But as important as the work is, the major focus of our work camps is the community that is formed between the work campers themselves and the work campers and our host families.  And we have been going to the same place.  We go to Grace House on the mountain in St. Paul, Virginia, which is owned by the Diocese of Southwestern Virginia.  We have some people who are coming back now for their thirteenth year.
DC: Amazing.
SE: That says they get something out of it, and they always go back to see families they worked with.
DC: What&#8217;s the community that they&#8217;re going into?
SE: Well--.
DC: Or are there several?
SE: There are several: St. Paul, Virginia; Coeburn, Virginia; Dante and West Dante, Virginia; [Pause] that whole area, coal mining area.  The Grace House facility was actually started by Episcopal deaconesses a good number of years ago, well, back in the &#8216;20s.
DC:  Right, so again women activists in the churches.
SE: And one of the reasons I asked you how much of the region you were interested in, is the woman who was there for a good number of years has gone on to become an Episcopal priest and is now in Bloomington, Illinois.
DC: Oh, interesting, yeah.
SE: Indiana, I&#8217;m sorry.
DC: In Indiana, yeah.
SE: But our work camps are probably the most visible thing that we do, and because as director of EAM I did very little hands on ministry, sat behind a computer and a telephone, I always went down.  It renewed my faith, particularly in young people, and it gave me some wonderful stories to tell about the work camp.
DC: How long would people spend?
SE: A week.  It used to be two weeks a summer and then became three weeks a summer, but we had different groups in.  Now we have two women--well one woman and one who started out as a sixteen-year-old--who spend all three weeks because they love what they&#8217;re doing, [Pause] and they love people.  We do an educational component, we have a group--.  The woman who we hired to cook was the self-ordained leader of a small nondenominational church there that started a food bank, and she needed some help with bringing the food storage area up to code.  It wasn&#8217;t home repair but it certainly was a benefit to the community so we worked with that, and the first year we worked building shelves, making things mouse proof, and so on.  We always have a picnic on Friday night that we invite all of the community that we worked with to come and join us as our guests and it&#8217;s just a big time of fellowship.  She asked if they could sing for us, and it&#8217;s wonderful mountain gospel, and most of our Episcopal born and bred had never heard that sort of music and were really touched.  So every Friday night now Violeta and her family sing for us.
DC: Fantastic.
SE: And it&#8217;s just a wonderful way of being; usually about half adult and half young people.  Last year was the first time--.  There were eleven work campers in the first work group.  Ten of them were adult women; one of them was the sixteen-year-old woman; and then our male work camp director.  We teased him about his harem. [Laughs] But it was a wonderful time for them, and a good number, I would say almost a third, of the young people that have come through have gone into helping professions, social work, ministry, doctor, nurse.
DC: So you can see a direct connection.
SE: I can see a direct connection, and most of them talk about that being one of the life changing events for them, and that for some of the adults too.
DC: So are you still doing both youth and adults and they go at the same time?
SE: They go at the same time; they work on the same teams together.  We usually do not--.  Occasionally we have family members come.  We don&#8217;t put family members in the same team; we try not to put people from the same place; we try to really mix it up and match it up, and just wonderful, wonderful times.  The cook&#8217;s granddaughter, who we met as a seven-year-old, has been coming around and helping me for eleven years and she graduates the 4th of June so I&#8217;m going up and going to help do her graduation party and so on.
DC: Wonderful.  So you really have developed close ties.
SE: Oh, yeah, very, very much so.  We had two work campers who met at work camp.  They were adults, they had both been married once before, both divorced, met at work camp and about three years later got married.  And when they got married, because they had homes and so on, they didn&#8217;t need wedding presents, so they asked if they could set up a scholarship fund for a student from the Grace House area as their wedding present and got a good number of contributions.  The young girl I was just telling you about is going to be the first recipient--
DC: Oh, what a great story.
SE: --of that.  It&#8217;s one of the things I helped facilitate and one of the things that brings me great joy, and yet it&#8217;s not something that you write in your job description.
DC: Sure.
SE: I mean those things are just--.  As they used to say when they started doing soup kitchen ministry and then it expanded, when people with needs, or when opportunities, you have to treat the whole panoply of challenges.
DC: I want to ask you, because we&#8217;re talking about working in a particular community and obviously these are communities with multiple issues, and we&#8217;ve talked a little bit about economic justice and environmental issues, and I&#8217;m curious.  I think I described for you the project that we&#8217;re working on with the Oral History Program that we call the Long Civil Rights Movement--
SE: Right.
DC: --and the idea that there wasn&#8217;t just this Civil Rights Movement but there&#8217;s been a long continuum of social justice work and so many movements are connected, one with the other.  I just wanted to ask you what your take is on that.  Do you think we&#8217;re on the right path with that take, or has that been your experience?
SE: It&#8217;s certainly been my experience.  We talk more about economic justice usually at work camps, simply because when you visit some of the homes and get to know the stories you see the economic justice issues and you see the environmental issues when people&#8217;s wells have been destroyed or polluted, and we&#8217;re not far from the community in which the three-year-old boy was killed in his crib by flyrock that came through.  The teaching opportunity--horrible tragedy; don&#8217;t mean that--because people were not aware of it.  I mean those kinds of things don&#8217;t make the paper anyplace else.
And we are so used to flipping the switch and there&#8217;s electricity and we never give it a thought.  One of the female priests who came with some youth said that until she heard one of our presentations it never occurred to her that the coal that was coming out of the ground, and she was seeing it leaving the area by train, was what made her electricity in Annapolis, Maryland.  It&#8217;s connecting those dots for people, things they know but they&#8217;ve never seen and, so all of a sudden when we put out a thing not long ago about holding Massey coal company accountable for the twenty-nine mine deaths recently in West Virginia it was very, very easy for me to generate fifty or sixty letters from people primarily who had been at work camp and who knew what this was all about.
DC: Right.
SE: We also have had a gay couple who were very active.  One of the men started the Toward Equality group in Delaware.  And the first year they were there everybody got to love them, and for a lot of people that was the first gay couple they&#8217;d ever met.  They looked a little askance at first, because they&#8217;re not shy, but by the end of the second year nobody thought anything about that being unusual.  I hope that will translate to their home settings.
So my job with work camps has always been to make it a safe, open experience, and it has.  It hasn&#8217;t been just me but somebody has to help set the tone, and there again most of the people we work for are women.  Women live longer than the men do, particularly in Appalachia for the most part, and they&#8217;re widows who can tell their stories, who welcome the kids, who love the kids.  One of my very favorite stories is about--.  We always say that as important as the work is the relationships come first, and every time I went to a job site one of the teenagers was sitting in the living room with the owner of the house, watching TV.  The second or third day I pulled her aside and I said, &#8220;Melissa, what are you doing?&#8221;  She said, &#8220;I&#8217;m doing what you told me to, Sandy.&#8221;  I said, &#8220;Oh, really?&#8221;  She said, &#8220;Yeah.  You told me to make friends with the homeowner, and Mrs. Hall said she&#8217;d always wanted a daughter like me to watch her stories with.&#8221;
DC: [Laughs] There you go.
SE: And I said, &#8220;Fine, as long as your teammates don&#8217;t give you a hard time, have at it.&#8221; [Laughs] Last time I heard they still were sending Christmas cards back and forth.  And I can&#8217;t guarantee that that carries over into how these people vote, who they vote for, what kind of anything they do, but I have to think that it does.
DC: I wonder if you could help me think through this part too, which is this particular phase of our research we&#8217;re looking at women&#8217;s activism, women&#8217;s leadership, and feminism and the idea of the modern women&#8217;s movement, and I&#8217;m wondering how you see these movements as having been expressed in the ministry that you&#8217;ve done, and do these terms apply for you and the women that you&#8217;ve worked with?
SE: We have tried to focus more on Appalachian ministry because particularly in the Episcopal Church there were other groups doing these other things.  We came together with them as members of the Consultation.  I think this right.  We used to call ourselves &#8220;what was left of the Left.&#8221;
DC: [Laughs] Right, I like that.
SE: And the Women's Caucus was part of that and they worked very strongly on feminist issues in the Church.
DC: This is in the Episcopal Church?
SE: In the Episcopal Church.  Integrity was a part of that, and of course they worked on the gay/lesbian/transgendered--though when they first started transgendered was not in there--issues, and so in the umbrella group of the Consultation we worked on those things, but like all good coalitions we did our own thing and we shared where we had common ground.  So we didn&#8217;t go off of our track of Appalachian ministry to do some of those kinds of things.
DC: Right, but you were--.
SE: But we certainly supported those who did, and one of the things I can remember--.  You were asking about women who started projects.  The Dungannon Development Project started as a GED program particularly for women, and then they had to go into some abuse shelters and so on because the women would come to school or come to the center for their GED classes and go home and get beat up by their husbands who didn&#8217;t want them getting an education.  So of course some of those issues had to be taken care of and that led into some of the empowering of women, that, yes, women can have educations, yes, women can do all these other things.  But we never talked about it as a feminist issue because we came at it from a slightly--.
DC: Your organization specifically.
SE: Yeah, and many of the grassroots organizations, partially because if you had talked about a feminist movement that would not have interested them at all.  They would not have seen the correlation between it and their lives.  The difference between theory and practice, although they dovetail, when you&#8217;re too far on one end of the spectrum it&#8217;s too hard to see the other end until you move together for awhile.
DC: So the label itself didn&#8217;t really--
SE: No.
DC: --need to be there.
SE: Plus the fact that most of us just don&#8217;t like labels.
DC: Mm hmm.
SE: I am told that in some ways one of the things that I did was a feminist issue because--.  Of course when APSO was founded there were no women on our board because it was the bishop and a clergy from each diocese, and of course at that point there were not--
DC: There weren&#8217;t female clergy yet.
SE: --any female Episcopal clergy and it took a long time even after there were to get some appointed.  And I can remember sitting in meetings because I was the only woman in most of the meetings and often the only layperson, always the only laywoman, and I would make a suggestion and nobody would say anything.  Five minutes later one of the clergy would use the exact same words and it would be the greatest idea since sliced bread.  I used to sneak away occasionally and go to the ladies room just to look in the mirror to make sure something reflected.
DC: [Laughs]
SE: I mean it became such a standing joke with a friend of mine that for Christmas one year she gave me a little mirror that had printed across the bottom, &#8220;There I am.&#8221;
DC: Amazing.
SE: That changed over the years, partly because I got a little older and you do have to earn your--.
DC: But how do you persevere within that kind of situation, or do you have--
SE: Well I&#8217;m just stubborn.
DC: --other allies--?  You&#8217;re stubborn. [Laughs] And you mentioned this other woman, so you find allies as well.
SE: The other woman was my daughter.
DC: Okay, yeah. [Laughs] So family.
SE: But particularly in CORA there were women who were doing the same kind of thing, probably on a much broader scale.  When I first started to work for APSO, in the Episcopal Church if you hire a clergy and you&#8217;re a church organization you have to pay his or her--at that time all his--pension fund and it&#8217;s set at a particular rate, but you did not have to pay pension fund or offer health benefits for lay employees.  APSO always offered health benefits for lay employees, but they didn&#8217;t offer pension funds.  I was newly divorced and I thought I should get a pension, just like everybody else, and I realized that we were a nonprofit so I had some qualms about doing anything that put a strain on the budget, but to me it was a justice issue, and if an organization is going to preach and advocate for justice it starts at home, just like charity starts at home.  Most of the people on the board I really liked, many I considered friends as well as colleagues, so I didn&#8217;t want to take a heavy-handed approach, but I got various friends to send me designer shopping bags from Bloomingdale&#8217;s and Saks Fifth Avenue and so on, and every time I went to board meeting I carried not all my stuff but some of my stuff in a shopping bag--mid &#8217;80s, a lot of talk about &#8220;bag ladies&#8221;--and I would just say, &#8220;Well I&#8217;m practicing up for when I retire, because I have no retirement benefits.&#8221;
DC: [Laughs] Right.
SE: And two years before the Church mandated lay employee benefits, APSO passed a board resolution.  Several of my friends say: One of the reasons you&#8217;re such a darn good advocate is because you look so sweet and so grandmotherly that nobody can believe [Laughs] you would do anything subversive.  My grandmother always said you can catch more flies with honey than vinegar.  I realize that there are times, and I&#8217;m glad that some of my colleagues are not quite as nice and soft spoken, because we need those voices too.
DC: Right.  But I think the point that you make there is very important about your willingness to push from within.
SE: Yeah.  Well back in the civil rights day there were two factions, those who pushed like anything from outside and those who chose to work from within, and the two factions didn&#8217;t always get along but we needed each other.  You have to find that chink and work from whichever side you can get in.
DC: That&#8217;s a nice way to put it.  You&#8217;ve mentioned CORA a number of times.  Was it your work with Appalachian Ministries working with CORA, or did you ever work officially with CORA?
SE: Well I worked with CORA--.  I worked as Appalachian staff because that was how the Episcopal money got in, and I served on a lot of their committees, but I also worked as a seconded staff for CORA--
DC: Oh, you did, okay.
SE: --at one point, and I staffed the program called Church and Community.  That was again helping church money help start programs in Appalachian areas that could be used for community groups, and it was following a particular curricula, if you will, program.  The best example of it, because it just took off, was done by a woman, Brenda Hughes, at the Bradley Initiative for Church and Community Work in Athens, Tennessee.  I can&#8217;t take any credit for finding Brenda, for signing her up on board, I was just the staff person that inherited that, but she has done a wonderful, wonderful job, and they work on all sorts of educational ideas.  They have I think one of only two nonprofit credit unions in the state, a lot of educational work, a lot of work on race relations in Athens. [Pause] And a couple of other projects that worked to a certain extent and then fell apart.  Then it ended up that I did nearly all of the bookkeeping work for CORA and have the distinction, which I wish I didn&#8217;t have, of having been the person that oversaw the closing down of CORA, which I&#8217;m not proud of but I am proud that at least we managed to close with dignity and with all of our bills paid, even some money left for some grassroots groups that are still working on some issues.
DC: So I&#8217;m curious [about] the gap that CORA has left behind and whether the churches are able to pick up that work themselves.
SE: Well there&#8217;s not the money.  The churches are doing a lot of work on their own but the real--.  Those that really suffer are the ones who do particularly small projects on their own and trying to get money and technical assistance, and just not coming up with it.
DC: Because CORA really served a middle role in funneling from the larger structure?
SE: It did, and it also brought together people working in maybe not the same areas but the same general social justice, economic justice work, and there are certain guiding principles that you can all learn from each other, and particularly if you&#8217;re in a small rural area it&#8217;s just so nice to know there&#8217;s somebody else out there.  You can feel so isolated.  There are still some organizations, but not with the same kind of clout that CORA had, that can speak out and speak for the church or prod the church leaders to speak out on such things as mine accidents and oil spills--although that was local--some of the poultry plant issues, a lot of the union issues, we were very active, particularly CORA but Episcopal Appalachian Ministries to a certain extent too, during the Pittston strike in &#8217;89/&#8217;90.
DC: That&#8217;s right.
SE: Bill probably talked some about that.
DC: I&#8217;ve heard it mentioned, yeah.
SE: Yeah, and if you talk to Jim Sessions he will talk a lot about it because he actually went as one of the Church leaders into the plant that the union took over.
DC: So the Church was fairly supportive of that,--
SE: Very, very supportive.
DC: --with the labor efforts?  Yeah.
SE: Yeah.  Helped work with some of the training on nonviolence.
DC: Okay, yeah.
SE: A lot of money, a lot of help in getting things organized.  In southwestern Virginia I can think of at least three priests who lost their jobs because our executive director talked them into -- didn&#8217;t have to talk very hard -- to helping go down and sit in, and coal company officials didn&#8217;t much care for it.  We&#8217;ve done a lot of fighting on mountaintop removal.  In fact if you want a non-Episcopalian to talk to, Pat Hudson, who&#8217;s here in Knoxville, has been very active.  Pat and Don Kopec, who is an attorney, have started an organization that does a lot of advocacy work on mountaintop removal and has actually gotten the Tennessee legislature to pass a couple of things--
DC: Oh, wow, great.
SE: --that help regulate it.
DC: And that&#8217;s someone that you know through CORA work or not?
SE: Well sort of through CORA work.  CORA rented offices in the old stone house that belonged to Church of our Savior, which is a United Church of Christ building, and because the pastor&#8217;s office was also in that building and my office was in that building we got to know each other and we keep running into each other.  Bill Troy knows John Gill.
DC: This is how these things work, right. [Laughs]
SE: And every time we turn around we run into each other at some kind of meeting or event or Martin Luther King Day march or something of that sort, so that&#8217;s why I got to know Pat and Don and we have shared some resources.  They have developed a wonderful program to be used in helping congregations understand the environmental impact from a spiritual aspect and a scriptural aspect and why we need to take care of our world.
DC: This is something that I&#8217;ve been hearing a lot about in churches for the last few years.
SE: Yeah.  But this goes beyond just getting rid of your Styrofoam cups, not that I&#8217;m knocking that by any means, but this is a real advocacy kind of issue and UCC seems to be very good at getting those kind of advocacy issues out, much better than we do sometimes.
DC: And you see the church in general as having a particular strength in that area?
SE: Yes.
DC: Why is that, do you think?
SE: Part of it&#8217;s their background.  I&#8217;m not real sure, because I know in this local congregation it&#8217;s because John Gill pushes it, so, and like-minded people attract like-minded people.  Is Lissa McLeod one of the people on your list?
DC: No.
SE: Lissa has worked with OREPA, which was the Oak Ridge Environmental Protection something or other, and they do a lot--.  Some of these places I&#8217;ve known so long and always known them by their acronym that now I can&#8217;t remember what the acronym stands for.
DC: Sure.  It&#8217;s OREPA?
SE: Mm hmm, and Bill Troy will know how to get in touch with her or I may even have an address for her.  She now does Circus for the World [One World Circus] which talks about environmental issues and social justice issues through clowning and puppets and mimicry and so on, and we use some of those, not from her, but some of the other women worked with them during the miners strike because they're a good rally event.
DC: So you learned some techniques that you used.
SE: Yeah.  She&#8217;s been active in a good number of things and a good number of social issues.  I think that she&#8217;s always lived in this area.  I know her only in association with things--I mean we&#8217;ve spoken but we&#8217;re not social friends, so I really don&#8217;t know that much of her story.
DC: Right.  I guess this has to do with CORA too, but in the &#8217;60s and into the &#8217;70s there was such a blossoming of the ecumenical movement in this country and it&#8217;s so important--
SE: Oh, yes.
DC: --in terms of advocacy networks like the kinds of things that you&#8217;re talking about and the work that has been done in Appalachia.  Have you seen those kinds of networks decrease with time?
SE: Yes.  That&#8217;s what we really lost with CORA as far as the denominational thing.  None of us have the money to make much impact in the region, but together we could, not only financially but there&#8217;s something to be said, and I&#8217;ve heard union leaders say it over and over and over, and environmentalists say over and over and over, it means so much to have the church community behind us because of the clout, and the environmentalists say because people pay attention to our religious leaders and that gives us a little bit less of this thing of being these crazy tree huggers.
DC: Right, legitimacy.
SE: And, yes, it is possible to get that same kind of support but it&#8217;s a lot harder because there&#8217;s not a central organization that will help make those connections and facilitate that.  Tena Willemsma, who was director of CORA, still tries to do a good bit of that.
DC: Are you hopeful at the moment?  How do you feel at the moment and how do you assess this moment in time, in our current political situation and our current President in 2010?
SE: I was a lot more hopeful in January of 2009 than in January of 2010, and that&#8217;s not just President Obama&#8217;s fault.  As the churches lose members, as they get embroiled in all sorts of fights, because the Episcopal Church is not the only one fighting over sexual issues, our energy seems to have been diverted and many of the churches or church leadership have sort of siege mentality, or an I&#8217;m-going-to-get-you-before-you-get-me mentality, and there&#8217;s not the real cooperation that there used to be.  The National Council of Churches is [1:18:12] many places.  Ecumenism--we&#8217;ve become so polarized that, you know, it would be very difficult, and it even was getting a little difficult at times with CORA.  Some of the worst battles I saw at CORA were when we put forth resolutions against the Gulf War because the church leaders had a tendency to be in opposition and the grassroots said you can&#8217;t do that because we support our troops and could not understand that you could still support your troops and not--
DC: Support the war, right.
SE: --support the war.  Plus the fact that there are a good number of people to whom it is our country, right or wrong.  I don&#8217;t agree with them but I certainly agree with their right to say that.  I would hope that they would begin to see that it&#8217;s only going to be right if they help make it right, but I&#8217;m not going to stand up and beat them over the head and tell them.
DC: [Laughs] Right.
SE: So I&#8217;m less hopeful but I&#8217;m more hopeful because I seem to see more individuals getting involved, particularly when they see a need, and how some of these small, small groups manage to keep going and do things, and then how you juxtapose that with some of the things on TV of people who have just renovated their kitchens for a hundred and eighty thousand dollars, you know.
DC: Right.
SE: Sorry.
DC: But yeah, the need is just going to keep growing.
SE: Oh, yeah.
DC: In our current economic situation.
SE: I have for the first time in my life started playing with stocks, and it&#8217;s really playing.  There&#8217;s so little money that I put in, it really is playing.
DC: Is playing. [Laughs]
SE: It might as well be Monopoly money, but I check a couple of times a day and I keep thinking I can see why people are worried.  I have friends who told me when I got ready to retire: You can&#8217;t retire on that amount of money.  You don&#8217;t have any stocks; you don&#8217;t have three quarters of a million dollars set aside that you need, or something of that sort; and I would say, well, you know, I&#8217;m going to just do it in faith because now is the time to do it.  I was talking to one a couple of days ago.  He said, &#8220;You know, I told you you couldn&#8217;t do it, that you really shouldn&#8217;t, you were not being very wise, but I probably have less money than you do now, because yours were in CDs and even though they quit drawing interest they didn&#8217;t lose value.  Mine went in stocks and they lost value.&#8221;
DC: Right, yeah.
SE: I think everybody&#8217;s a little nervous and it seems to bring two very strong reactions.  Either you begin to be more willing to help your neighbor or you become so frightened that you&#8217;re not going to get your share that that&#8217;s all you can think of, is how do I get my share and how do I prove I&#8217;m right?
DC: But the potential is there for this to be a moment that really draws people together, you think?
SE: I think so.  I hope so.  I keep reading about all the stories from the Depression and I keep seeing Brian Williams&#8217; &#8220;People Who Make a Difference&#8221; report and I think: They&#8217;re still there.  There&#8217;s still that good.  Then I listen to the news and I don&#8217;t feel quite as hopeful.  I&#8217;m extremely disappointed in our politicians, not only for their own moral conduct but for those who--.  And I can&#8217;t fault them for just saying, I&#8217;ve had enough, but some of the really good politicians who have said I just can&#8217;t do this anymore.  And yeah, I do believe there are a few good politicians.
DC: [Laughs] A few, yeah.  Well we&#8217;ve covered a lot of ground.  Is there anything that I didn&#8217;t ask or that we didn&#8217;t talk about that you want to make sure we discuss?
SE: Just there&#8217;s no way to talk about the unsung heroes--or "sheroes&#8221;, if you want to use a feminist term--that I meet every day or that I met through this twenty-three years.  When the literacy programs first started most of the women who came in were grandmothers who were raising their grandchildren because families had disintegrated and who knows what happened to the kids&#8217; parents, but they wanted to learn to read for two reasons: They wanted to help their grandchildren with their homework and they wanted to read the Bible to them, which, you know, those are women who are touching people&#8217;s lives and we&#8217;ll never know their names, but their children or grandchildren are very lucky.
Throughout Appalachia, like much of the South, it&#8217;s still a matriarchal society and I think that&#8217;s one of the reasons why the feeling of place and family is so important.  I told you we were going up for this graduation and that I was going to help with the party, and of course I&#8217;m an only child who married an only child.  We could have our family reunions in a telephone booth, if we could even find a telephone booth these days.  But I said about how many people do you think will be here, and the answer was, well a lot of the family is coming so there will probably be about fifty people.
DC: Yeah.
SE: [Pause] Can you get together fifty relatives?
DC: No.
SE: I can&#8217;t either. [Laughs]
DC: It couldn&#8217;t happen. [Laughs]
SE: No. [Laughs]
DC: That&#8217;s amazing, yeah, and that&#8217;s just a lot; that&#8217;s not all.
