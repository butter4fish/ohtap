 Little Thunder  Yellowman  My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is November 21, 2011,  and I   m at the Cheyenne Arapaho tribal  Department of Education ,  interviewing artist Gordon Yellowman. Gordon, you   ve worked for the  C-A tribe in Culture and Heritage and Education. You   re an adjunct  professor at Southwestern  Oklahoma  State University, and you have  important ceremonial and leadership roles in your tribe. You   re also an  artist, perhaps best known for your ledger art. Thank you for taking the  time to speak with me.  You   re welcome.  Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  I was born in Clinton, Oklahoma, at the Indian hospital there. I grew up  in Watonga, Oklahoma.  What did your folks do for a living?  My dad worked for the Pioneer Telephone Company. He was what you  call a linesman. He would climb telephone poles, and he would be  laying new lines across western Oklahoma. My mother served as a  teacher   s aide for the public schools there.  Did you spend very much time around your grandparents?  Yes. From what I remember, I really was fortunate to be able to learn  from my grandmother as well as my grandfather. My grandmother   s  name was Mary Alice Antelope-Yellowhawk, and my grandpa was Fred  Yellowhawk. My grandmother was a bead worker but a ceremonial lady,  as well, and so I was very fortunate to be able to spend time with her  during the summer, as well as my grandfather, who I   m named after. He  5  Little Thunder  Yellowman  Little Thunder  Yellowman  Little Thunder  Yellowman  gave me his Cheyenne name,  Yellowhawk .  You   re fluent in Cheyenne? Is that right?  Depends on fluency. I can understand more than I can speak, but as I  learn   I   m currently serving as the director of the language program for  the tribes, and it   s starting to come back, the memory of talking  Cheyenne as well as talking Arapaho because my father was fluent and  my mother was fluent. Father was Cheyenne, and my mother was  Arapaho.  What is your earliest memory of seeing art?  My earliest memory of seeing art is   I   m going to tell you a story of  how it all began. We all went to my grandmother   s house in the  wintertime when it was snowing, and she gave us this Big Chief tablet  and pencils, and she said,    You boys quit jumping on the beds and quit  running around. Come to the kitchen table and draw.    So we all sat at  the table, and everyone   s all looking at each other trying to see what  we   re drawing. I was about, I   m going to say thirteen years old when I  was introduced to that tablet by my grandmother.  For me, I didn   t want my siblings, my brothers, to see what I was  drawing, so I get up, and I go to the window. It   s snowing, and I look  out, and I see the corral of our horses. There is the young yearling, the  baby horse that   s with the mom. I start sketching the horses, and I was  so excited because I drew the horses. I couldn   t wait to get home to tell  my mom and dad. I was all excited, and I ran in, and I showed them my  Big Chief tablet with my drawing on it, and I said,    Mom  Mom  Dad,  look what I drew     Their response was,    No, you didn   t.    I felt like a  balloon losing its air.  I just kind of didn   t know how to respond to that. I was disappointed.  Little did I know, later on I realized that was their challenge. They  challenged me to prove to myself to keep drawing, keep drawing, keep  drawing. After that, so to speak, the Big Chief tablet was my very first  introduction to ledger art because that   s where ledger artists started  drawing: in these journals, these ledger books that the Army officers  had. I can relate to that story, paper being introduced to them as a new  medium, and so it was introduced to me by my grandmother, Mary.  Did you have any extended family members who were artists?  My dad was quite an artist. He always doodled around and did sketches.  I remember one time   he was good at cartoons, and I remember seeing  a dictionary where he would draw animals in a dictionary. If the animal  6  Little Thunder  Yellowman  Little Thunder  Yellowman  Little Thunder  Yellowman  was incomplete, he would finish the drawing. I never saw him paint. I  never saw him draw, produce drawings, but he was always doodling. On  my mom   s side, there was a gentleman by the name of Wayne Arthur.  He was very, very good at drawing. He was my mom   s relative on the  Northern  Arapaho  side, and he came one winter and stayed with us.  He would always draw. I remember this so vividly and clear because in  December, the National Finals Rodeo always came on, and he would  draw those ropers, those bull riders, those bareback riders, saddle bronc.  It was just amazing how he could draw them. I   d always sit down and  tell him,    Draw the bull rider. Draw the bareback,    and he would sketch  it in paper. So it was there that I started admiring what he was doing,  how he drew to make it come alive. I just admired him for that, and I  couldn   t wait for him to come back to the next visit. I kept some of them  drawings, and throughout the years they were misplaced. So he   s the one  that had a lot of influence on making me sketch every day.  That was action, which is hard to do.  Yes, he was doing action. It was just amazing, such a photographic  memory of all the action. The horse, again, the horse was very important  to not only the Cheyenne people but Arapaho as well as Plains people.  That horse was there when I looked out the window.  Am I right that your signature, your artist   s remarque, is a horse?  Now, yes, my signature mark is the horse because of the icon of how I  draw it. It kind of has my own, so to speak, trademark, and I can identify  that   s my horse because of the way I draw it. There   s always something  that will tell you as a collector or person that knows my art, that is my  work.  Sherman Chaddlesone   s grandma kept one of those Kiowa calendars,  and he saw that when he was really young. I was wondering if you saw  any ledger art at a young age or not.  Not really. The only thing that I remember seeing is, as I said, my  grandmother was a bead worker. She made moccasins, and she made  different types of beadwork. One of the things I remember is she had  this strip of buckskin, and they had all her designs on it, all her  beadwork designs. I don   t know that there was a specific name for it, but  every bead worker had that piece of canvas or buckskin with their  moccasin designs, their dress designs, their shirt designs, their men  designs, women designs, animal designs. That was where I was  introduced to seeing images of art.  7  Little Thunder  Yellowman  Little Thunder  Yellowman  Geometric.  Yes, geometric. For me, as far as ledger, throughout my career and  repatriation work with this new law that came about, NAGPRA  Native  American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act  in 1990, I was the  first Cheyenne representative to do repatriation and represent the tribes  in going out to various museums, national museums.  I went to Denver and looked at the Cheyenne Dog Soldiers ledger book,  and that was quite inspiring to me. Then I also looked at the Fort Marion   Florida  ledger artists there. That was the beginning of ledger art for  how they were documenting history, actually telling real-life stories and  history of what they experienced and what they missed as a culture, as a  people. Then I went to New York and looked at ledger books there.  I started looking at ledger books through my work and started to study it  and started interpreting these stories of what they were saying and  started to find out that they   re actually historical accounts that reflect not  only their experiences but Cheyenne history.  I want to come back to that a little bit. When you were in primary and  middle school, in public schools, was there any art instruction? Up  through high school, do you remember taking any art classes?  No, I never took any formal art. I just really kind of like doodled around,  never took it serious, and it   s just something that I always thought was a  challenge by my parents to keep doing it, and I did. Back then I was just  doing it for a dollar here, dollar there, sell something. I   ll tell you a story  about how I started. I didn   t take any formal education in grade school,  junior high. Then I left, and I went to Idaho during my high school  freshman year, eighth grade transitioning to freshman.  I went to Idaho, and I lived in Rigby, Idaho, for a year, and I learned to  drive a truck there. I was very young, and I worked at the potato cellars.  I had to drive the trucks through the cellars and load them, and then  drive them to the fresh pack, they called it. One of the drivers didn   t  show up one day, and so the boss man comes down there, and he says,     You   re going to have to drive the truck through the cellars.    Didn   t  know anything about driving big trucks in stick shift. He gave me a  crash course, and that   s where I learned how to drive these big trucks.  After that experience, I   d gotten along, and I said,    Well, I want to go  back home to Watonga.    I was entering into the tenth grade, high school,  and I befriended this white girl. She was pretty. Of course, you see her,  you get there. When I first went back to school, she came and talked to  me, and she was the president of the class. I admired her for coming  8  over and talking to me because she made me feel like, she made me feel  good as a student. She came and sat by me, and, of course, her being a  white girl and me a Cheyenne, it made me feel like she was listening or  acknowledging me than my own peers and friends.  So I had to transition into high school and then became acquainted with  her. It was my junior year where she was the president of the play. They  put on a play in the high school, and I can   t remember what it was. She  said,    Hey, I   ve got a favor to ask you,    and so I said,    Sure, what is it?     Kind of like,    Yes, I   ll do something for you as a friend.    She said,    I  need you to make my props for our play.    She said,    I know you draw,  and I   ve seen you draw.    I said,    Sure.    Her and I, we got to spend a lot  of time together, so it was like,    Wow, I   m around her     (Laughter) You  know how that goes.  We go down, and we collect cardboard boxes, and I painted cars. I  painted their backdrop with the windows, everything they needed. I  painted a horse. Everything they needed for their play, I did it out of  cardboard. When the art teacher, who at that time was Judy McCombs,  she was the high school art teacher, she came down there when we were  working on the set. She stopped there. She looked, and she asked my  friend,    Where did you get these props? Where did you buy these  props?    And she said,    I didn   t buy them.    I was sitting in the  auditorium, waiting on her. I was sitting there, and she pointed at me,     He did it.     She came right over there, and she grabbed me by the arm, and she said,     You   re going with me.    I thought,    Uh-oh, I   m in trouble. I shouldn   t  have done that.    We marched down to the office, and I thought I was in  trouble. She said,    I   m enrolling you in my art class for next year, your  senior year. Why haven   t you enrolled in ninth, tenth, and eleventh?  Why haven   t you?    I said,    Because I felt like no one cared about my  art. No one appreciated it, so I just never took formal art.    That senior  year, she gave me a little corner in the area of the classroom, and she  blocked me off from everybody.  When she took me to the office, I felt like,    Oh, I   m the Indian, and  she   s going to get me in trouble again, or she   s going to blame me for  something, being around these white girls or something.    That   s how it  was back then. It was very hard to befriend girls that weren   t of your  race. It just wasn   t heard of. That year, my senior year, all I did was  produce art. She said,    Just draw and paint, draw and paint.    She lived a  mile from me. I would run out of supplies sometimes, and I would walk  over to her house, and she   d give me paper, give me whatever I needed  to keep drawing. She   s the one that really began my formal art career in  how to draw and got me in an art class. That year, I was recognized. I  9  Little Thunder  Yellowman  Little Thunder  Yellowman  Little Thunder  Yellowman  got an award for my art, a high school student. I admire her for taking  me into that office and enrolling.  That   s wonderful. Were you painting any Indian subject matter?  I was just kind of painting anything I could. I painted acrylic paintings  and I painted   back then, the black light was very popular, so I did neon  colors, black light colors on felt. I started drawing posters of bands back  then: Grand Funk Railroad, Mott the Hoople. All of those bands, I would  draw them and paint them, then I   d sell the posters in school, ten dollars,  five dollars, and back then, then I would use the money to buy me more  paints and buy me more brushes and buy me more canvas. Back then,  we didn   t have stretched canvas. We just had board canvas. I would  have to buy my own felt just to stretch it and paint a poster and then put  a black light under it, and it was like,    Wow     (Laughter)  You went to OSU briefly.  Yes, my next step in my education was back in    87. I started working for  the Cheyenne Arapaho tribes in 1979 under the CETA program. It was  called Comprehensive  Employment and  Training Act, and I started  working right out of high school from    78 to    79 for a year. Then the  tribes picked me up after the program. Then in    87, I started out as a  janitor, mopping floors, sweeping and vacuuming hallways, and  emptying trashcans. In    87, I said,    I need to do something with my art. I  can   t be a janitor all my life.     So then I went back to school at Canadian Valley Vo-Tech. It was a  commercial and graphic art program, and I finished that. It was a two-year  program, and I finished it in one year, and that year I was voted the  outstanding IT student of the year out of all the students. Then  Oklahoma State University gave me a tuition-waiver scholarship, and  that   s where I went. It was Oklahoma City extension, OSU school.  They didn   t have any art classes. They just had architectural. The tuition  was paid for me free, so I went there from 1989 to    92. Spent two years  there. I went on from there, and I came back to work as a consultant,  learning how to do illustration design work there on illustration boards. I  designed schematic designs of how the building was going to look at the  end of when it was built.  You had that architectural background.  Yes, and I loved it. I loved it because what I learned at OSU is I learned  how to do things shortcut. The way I was doing them before was taking  longer, and they taught me how to cut that in half. That   s where I  10  Little Thunder  Yellowman  Little Thunder  Yellowman  Little Thunder  learned how to do floor plans. I had to learn how to draw houses, design  houses from perspective drawings all the way to specifications of a  house. I loved doing designs for illustration work, and that   s where I  found watercolor. Watercolor, I enjoyed it because it was fast. I didn   t  have to wait. On acrylic and oils, you have to wait until it dries. Or when  you   re applying, you can   t hardly work with it as you can. You can   t  control watercolor. It controls you. You understand it   s fast, and so I  loved it.  That was my education at Oklahoma State University. Loved that  school. Then I learned how to design houses, write specs, so I came back  to work for the tribes as a consultant for the housing program, and I  eventually became housing director.  When did you make your first venture into Indian art shows?  Well, when I first started going out of high school, I went to different  small shows. I went to the very first Watonga Cheese Festival, and I got  best of show there and first place.  Was it for Indian subject matter?  No, it was open, open categories. Indian subject matter for me, it was  always there. I always sketched Indian things whether they were  political statements or back then, everything was about AIM  American  Indian Movement ,    better red than dead,    those kind of statements. It   s  like in high school, that was kind of the trend and the movement that  was going on, and it was a very powerful movement. It   s kind of like  you sit there and read the messages but also would stay back as an artist.  Like, how can I use my art to visualize and express how I truly feel  about what   s going on with the situation now versus the expression  through my art? That   s how I took it. I would draw things, say, for  instance, the Vietnam War. I would draw images of that era and turn it  into Indian. That statement that I would draw was kind of transitioning  from that era into the movement of the American Indian Movement,  which we were actually living with it in that time.  Indian art could have been humorous at that time, could have been  political, could have been   what do I say? Humorous? But it was a pop  culture at that time. That   s why I have the black lights and the neon  paints. It was that type of movement that I admired because of the  colors. It was a very powerful color to mess with, and that   s what I  enjoyed about it, seeing that color come out at you at that time.  How and when did you meet your wife, Connie?  11  Yellowman  Little Thunder  I met Connie through working for the tribes. She was working in the  planning department as a grant writer, and I was working on art projects  for the planning department. I had to draw the tribal service area and all  the original allotments. I was working on a mapping project, and she  was sort of the program specialist at that time. Then she came, and they  said,    We want you to draw these maps,    because back then they didn   t  have computer, and they knew I had architectural training and could  read the architectural scales. I understood scales. Quarter inch equals a  foot, or half inch equals a mile. I could do all of that. Everything was  done freehand on illustration boards. I produced the very first map for  the tribes on their tribal service area, and I researched all the original  allotments, and I drew them. I drew them to scale.  Connie, at that time, she came to me, (I had no idea what budgets really  were) and she said,    How much time is it going to take you to draw  this?    I said,    Oh, I don   t know. I could spend one hour a night. I could  spend two. I could spend all night. I don   t know. I can   t tell you that.     She said,    Well, what do you need to produce this?    and I said,    Why  are you asking these questions?    She said,    Because we   ve got monies  to buy you the stuff you need that you   re going to do.    I said,    Oh,  okay.    So she bought all of the supplies, and our working relationship  had begun because she would help me do the research and then tell me  what she wanted, and the end product was the maps. I told her how the  technical illustration pens and architectural pens were very expensive,  and so I was very careful about the quality of the supplies.  So that   s where we met. Then that summer, two years later, she made a  vow to put up Sun Dance and get involved in our Cheyenne ceremonies.  That summer, she comes to the Sun Dance, and then being acquainted  with one another and supporting one another, not only through work but  on the personal side of it because it transitioned over to,    This is  serious.    We had to respect one another at that level of what she was  carrying and what my role was at that time, and it still is to this day.  That   s how we began our relationship. Right after that, she goes to the  University of South Dakota as  an Indian  law fellowship. She was a  Native American law fellow for a year. That   s when she spent a year up  there teaching law, researching law. After she came back, then that   s  when we really started getting serious about our relationship and  eventually got married. Then we had our daughter, Cricket. That   s where  I first met her, was there at the planning  department .  It   s really neat how all of this work experience threads back into your  artwork, and, of course, Connie does beadwork. When you started doing  booth shows, what was that like? Did you exhibit together a fair amount  12  Yellowman  Little Thunder  Yellowman  Little Thunder  Yellowman  of time?  Yes. Again, it was   when she went to South Dakota, we went up there  in August, maybe July, I think it was July, to go look for an apartment.  We went up there, and we found her an apartment. It was that winter that  she wanted to learn quillwork, so she made contact with some of the  elder ladies there, the Sioux ladies, and they told her how to do it and  showed her how to do it. So during the winter, that   s all she did, was did  quillwork to teach herself how to do it. She already knew the beadwork.  She did the beadwork. Learned her beadwork from the Clinton  grandmothers.  While she was there for that year in South Dakota, that   s all she did, and  when she started coming back, she started making different pipe bags,  cradleboards, soft cradles, and different quillwork materials. I finally  told her,    Why don   t you come to Red Earth?    My very first time  entering Red Earth was in    94. The first year, I did it alone. The second  year, I said,    Let   s apply together,    so she applied with me, and we both  got accepted. We enjoyed having a booth together. She won awards, and  I won awards. We just kind of supported each other through her  beadwork, quillwork, and she supported me through the paintings and  the drawings I was doing, ledger drawing style. I had to create my own  ledger style to be, so to speak, different from other ledger artists.  I wanted to talk about that. The ones that come to mind are Sherman  Chaddlesone and Sharon Ahtone Harjo did a bit of ledger work. How  did you approach yours to make it     I didn   t have any idea how I was going to do it, so I started  experimenting with it, getting different paper, ledger paper. Then I  would find ledger books, or somebody would give me blank pieces of  paper, and someone said,    You have to use color pencils.    I started using  Prismacolor because I was introduced to Prismacolor at Oklahoma State  University. They taught me how to use Prismacolors, and I learned that.  I started to say,    Well, I   m going to do watercolor,    so then I  transitioned into, instead of doing the Prismacolor, I started painting  these paintings of ledger work, and that   s when I realized,    Hey, I can  do this.    It   s my own style. It   s contemporary, using contemporary style,  creating your own style but still historically following what they  followed. Researching ledger art, all of the Cheyenne work goes from  right to left.  Are you a Fort Marion descendent?  Yes, my grandfather was there. Of course, we   re related to everybody.  13  Little Thunder  Yellowman  Many of the Cheyenne Arapaho people are related to the Fort Marion.  The lineage kind of comes down and expands to immediate family and  also family in general, so somewhere there   s a connection there with the  prisoners of war. What I want to say is I commend them for having such  a vast knowledge of history and documenting it through our ledger art.  I was really struck, and I don   t know if it   s just been the ones that I   ve  seen, but it seems like a lot of the ledger work was done by Cheyenne  prisoners. Let   s go back a little bit to your first visit to the Colorado  Historical Society. You went for NAGPRA, but then you started looking  at the ledger work. Was there any surprises for you, I guess, when they  brought the first ledger books out for you to look at? Anything surprise  you?  It was very surprising and exciting to see it, knowing that that ledger  book was produced by the Dog Soldiers, Hotam  taneo'o, Tall Bull,  White Horse. Those leaders back then, they were very prominent, strong  leaders in that society, strong leaders of Cheyenne. To know that it was  produced by them and telling their story, seeing the art but also seeing  the vivid picture of history, their encounters with the army, their  encounters with the white man, it was very powerful on its own.  To hold it in your lap and look in it and hold it and see those images of  history, that was very powerful, me as an artist and them as an artist,  connecting with one another, not only through pages of time but pages  of art, but also expressing their message and interpreting that piece of art  they drew, the messages encoded in there. As an artist, you can see and  interpret what they   re saying, their actions and what they   re doing. We  had that connection as artists, and we had that connection as leaders, and  so it was powerful for me to hold it and see it. I had to wear white  gloves. It   s like it   s all about standards in museum practice.  There   s a story I tell about the white gloves when I started working with  the repatriation, when I very first did consultation with the Cheyenne  elders, Mary Armstrong, Willie Fletcher, and also Annabelle Medicine  Chips, Bertha Little Coyote. All of those elders are gone.  I took them to Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History in  Norman, and when I get there, I told them, I said,    You   ve got to wear  these white gloves.    They said,    Why?    I said,    That   s a standard policy  before you handle objects or artifacts. You   ve got to protect yourself and  protect the object. There   s acid buildup on your fingers, and your  fingerprints could get on the object. These objects have been treated,  some of them chemically, and we don   t want the poisons to get on us. So  these gloves are our white sage. We use our sage to purify ourselves  before we work, anything we do. These gloves are that sage.    They said,  14  Little Thunder  Yellowman  Little Thunder  Yellowman  Little Thunder     Oh, okay,    so they put them on. That was it.  I had to be creative in transitioning the traditional value versus the  museum value of how they do that. I always remember that story about  the white gloves, how I had to be creative. Then, when we started the  video camera recording, they said,    What is that?    I said,    Well, when  we look at an object, it   s going to spark your memory, and you   re going  to start telling stories about your grandmother, your mother, or perhaps  yourself, of what you know about that object. It sparks your memory.  This video camera is the white man   s memory.    They said,    Oh, okay.     So that was it. (Laughter) I had to be creative again in explaining and  making them comfortable and accepting that it was okay. That was my  work in NAGPRA, learning how to be creative.  Once you had seen that ledger art at the Historical Society, you also  looked at it at the Denver Art Museum and then at the Smithsonian?  Yes, the Denver Art Museum, they had contemporary ledger art done by  contemporary ledger artists, and that   s where I learned. I looked at  theirs, and they   re very powerful, colorful. One thing there that certainly  caught my eye was the parasols, the umbrellas. That   s when I started  drawing parasols and umbrellas, incorporating it into my ledger art.  Who were a couple of the artists that you particularly thought did a  good job?  There was a lady at the Denver Art Museum who had one drawing. I  can   t remember her name right off the bat, but her colors were so bold  and the umbrellas and the way she drew the horses. I remembered that  one painting in the collection at that time on the wall, so I marked that.  As far as artists like the Dog Soldier artists, the more you study ledger  art, you can start seeing, start determining who the artist   s style was  because one artist drew a horse different from the other. You start to  recognize through looking at and studying these ledger drawings. You   re  starting to see a consistent pattern of,    Oh, that may be drawn by White  Horse.       Oh, that might be drawn by Tall Bull.    You start to see.  There   s no signature on it. There   s a name glyph, but the name glyph is  identifying who   s in that ledger drawing. It may not be the artist, or  could it be the artist drawing himself. Those are some of the questions  that still remain, but you can see the pattern of how that horse is drawn.     Oh, that   s by        One of the problems with the Native art, when the work is created for the  commercial market, is that it may be missing part of its context. How do  15  Yellowman  Little Thunder  Yellowman  Little Thunder  Yellowman  Little Thunder  you address that in your own work, your own ledger art?  Going back to the economics of it, you   re going to make your artwork or  transition your artwork into what   s selling. It can be very popular culture  art, so whatever   s happening at that time, they all want to be part of that  economic boom or value, and we automatically as artists will render  something that   s going to reflect what   s popular.  Ledger art, when I first started doing it back in the    90s, I want to say     95 to 2000, was very popular. You were competing with everybody  because everybody was doing ledger art. Today, there   s very few that  are doing it, especially Cheyenne artists. I think there   s me that   s doing  it, James Black, Frank Sheridan, that are truly dedicated to putting our  work for ledger art. We continued it. We didn   t stop. Others that were  doing it, they stopped because it was just an economic time, a value.     Oh, well, that   s not popular anymore, so I   m not going to do it.     You have to be very dedicated if you   re going to do it, to stick with it. A  lot of it is, so to speak, generic. A lot of it is stereotyped. Big Chief  Indian, commercial. The commercial of it is sending off stereotyped  images. They   re not really the true image of that tribe, so you   re going to  have that type of situation. It can be very controversial. It can be very  sensitive. It can be very disrespectful. That   s how I would answer that  and see it from an artist   s perspective. We   re very fortunate to be able to  understand what is the true expression of that art.  In 2000 you won first place in miniatures, was it, for your miniature  ledger book?  Yes.  How did you get the idea for a miniature ledger book?  Actually, I struggled. I was getting discouraged because I never won an  award at Red Earth. I got honorable mention, but nothing    That was  their first year of having a miniatures division, and I thought,    I   m going  to enter this. I   m going to turn my ledger art that I produce into a  miniature.    Connie said,    How are you going to do that?    I said,    Good  question.    (Laughter) I found an old billfold, and I found paper, and I  made my own ledger paper. They gave me dimensions of the  qualifications of a miniature, so I took those dimensions, and I just  condensed it into making my own. I did twelve   no, I think it   s ten. I  think it   s ten pages.  Did you hand-reduce   you made the ledger paper?  16  Yellowman  Little Thunder  I hand-drew all the lines of the paper, and I drew the little numbers in.  Each image tells a history of my life, and it ends with Cricket and  Connie standing in the last page, standing there in their dresses. It started  out from my great-great-grandfather Sharpnose to Sand Creek 1864 to  Washita, highlights. My grandfather Sharpnose, he was a second  lieutenant at Fort Robinson in 1878. I started there and started recording  significant parts of my life and history. That   s why I call it Chief  Yellowman   s Ledger Book. I produced it, and it got in there and just  thought,    I just got to try.    I hand-sewed all of the paper images into it. I  won first place on it, and I about fell over and died because I didn   t  expect to win first place. (Laughter) I finally won it, and then that just  gave me an answer that I can do this.  To me, the commercialism in art is, whenever I started my art, it was my  getaway. I went into other travels, other parts of the world, other parts of  time, but when it became a have-to-do thing, commercial, and people  demand my art so I   ve got to produce it and sell it, that takes the fun out  of it, and it   s no longer my getaway. It   s no longer my escape to never-never  land or dreamland of how our people were, their time zone. Now  I   ve got to the point where I get to pick and choose what I do, and it   s  me doing it.  Artists have to be in a mood to do it. You can   t just clock in eight  o   clock and clock out five o   clock and say,    Okay, this is how many I  produced.    It don   t work that way. You   ve got to be in the mood to paint  and draw. Every artist knows that, and so there   s a little imagination  tapeline around me when I   m working. I zone out. I don   t hear the phone  ring. I don   t hear the TV on. I don   t hear anything. Connie and Cricket,  they know that zone line. They can   t cross into it, and that   s just the rule.  Cricket kind of got upset at me because one of my friends came over,  and she said,    How come they get to pass through the line and we  can   t?    (Laughter) I said,    Just trying to be courteous.    They know the  rule. Sometimes it   s good. Sometimes it   s bad. In the end, the whole  outcome is positive because if people are that appreciative of the art that  they want to buy it, then you know that it   s not just the value in that art.  It   s the quality.  The quality is what collectors look for, the true accuracy of what you   re  painting as far as an image or sending a message, and that   s what they   re  buying. They   re not just buying a piece of work. They   re buying a piece  of history. They   re buying a piece of culture, and they   re buying a piece  of voice. But most of all, they   re buying that spirit of what you   re  producing from that art.  In 2005, you had a show at Southern Plains  Indian Museum. Was it a  17  Yellowman  Little Thunder  Yellowman  combination of new paintings and older work? I know Connie had work  in there, too.  Yes, we did it as a family, Cricket did work. She has been a Red Earth  award-winning artist, as well, in the youth art, so we felt like we   d do it  together, combine pieces. I take my artwork, ledger art, and she takes  her beadwork, and Cricket brings hers. I thought that was not only  convenient but honorable to have three, parents and a daughter, there  and the show at the Southern Plains Museum to highlight our work.  They made these brochures and helped get our art out there to the public  but also to collectors. Making artwork known at that level, national  level, to be recognized at the Southern Plains Museum, to me, that was  awesome.  You   ve also done a couple of book covers. One was for a Jumping  Mouse story, and the other was a book called Eagle Catcher. Were these  from paintings that you did especially as cover art, or did the authors or  the publishing company see an image of yours that they thought would  be good?  It was the authors that I worked with. They want specific illustrations,  and they want specific things tying into their    The first book jacket I  did was Eagle Catcher by Margaret Coel. She was from Denver. It was  published by the Colorado Press out of Boulder, so I worked with her. It  was very good. It was kind of simple. I did maybe two what we call     one was a schematic design, and the second one was a painting that I  sent because she told me what she wanted, so I sent it. I had one  modification that wasn   t much. It was on color. I got my name in the  system of the publishers as an artist.  Authors will say,    I   m looking for this.    Then they   ll send you the  artist   s name, and then you work with the authors. That   s how I got the  second one, which was Tell Me, Grandmother. That was by Dr. Virginia  Sutter. Margaret referred her to me. That one, we worked with the  publisher, and it was more difficult working with the publisher than the  author. The publisher wanted certain things. I painted this very beautiful,  I thought, appropriate painting of Tell Me, Grandmother. I painted my  grandmother holding a cane, telling the story, and she had her scarf on  and her cane and her little dress that she wore. I painted her. The colors  were so powerful, the images, I just knew that that was going to be the  cover, and they said,    No, that   s not it.     Then I thought,    Well, what is it?    I kept sending different modification  sketches and went back and forth for a while, and finally I said,    You  know what, this is it. If this isn   t going to do it, then I   ll just pull myself  from the project. I can   t continue to keep       So I did this painting and  18  Little Thunder  Yellowman  kind of changed up the colors, made it more appropriate. I put it in the  mail, and I said,    This is the final. Accept it or not. Mail it back.    They  said,    This is it. This is what we   ve been waiting for.     It   s ironic how the author, the publisher, then you, you work around each  other. They all get frustrated. You get frustrated. Then pretty soon, you  are ready to throw the towel in, give up, and then it   s like,    This is it.     That cover turned out to be nice, and we did some little changes on it  graphically. So Tell Me, Grandmother is my ledger art.  There   s lots of issues involved when non-Indians paint Indian subject  matter and they don   t do their research, or sometimes they don   t even  question the appropriateness of painting certain subjects. I know there  was an incident at Santa Fe Indian Market a couple years ago when a  non-Indian artist was showing a painting of a Cheyenne Dog Soldier.  Some C-A tribal members confronted him about that. Can you talk about  that?  Yes, first of all, you see the painting in the  American  Indian Art  Magazine. It was one of the very prominent magazines there. We   re  thumbing through it, and we see it. Of course, we   re saying,    Oh, I don   t  know. I wonder who he is,    and,    Look at this.    It   s very sensitive, an  image of a Sun Dancer, and in there it says    Cheyenne Sun Dancer.    He  has the image of the sacred ceremonial dance that the Cheyennes still,  we still have that among our religious traditions and practices. It   s a part  of our ceremony. It   s our ceremony. I saw it and read it and then just  kind of thought,    Hmm, I want to meet this artist and talk to him and  find out exactly why he painted it and who gave him permission to paint  it. Why did he paint it?     It got to that point where I was aware of it, and when I get out there, I  run into several artists who are Cheyenne but also society members, and  they said,    We need to go over there and talk to this artist and tell him  that this is sensitive. We just need to go talk to him.    I think his name is,  I want to say DJ or D-something Challenger. I said,    Okay, I   ll meet you  over there in front of that studio,    the gallery where he was showing. He  was showing there the paintings of what he did. He wasn   t in Santa Fe  Indian Market because I don   t think he could meet the qualifications of  being accepted into the Market because he   s non-Indian.  We go into the gallery where he   s having an exhibition, showing. When  we get there, one Cheyenne member   s already there, and then the other  one shows up. We look up, and we see the painting hanging in the  window. Then we kind of gather our thoughts and said,    Hmm, yes,  we   re artists, but we really don   t expose things like this that   s this  sensitive into our art. We know what we can and can   t do.    They felt  19  Little Thunder  Yellowman  Little Thunder  like we needed to do something because when we come home as  Cheyennes and we were aware of it and didn   t do anything about it, we  would be the ones that would catch it from our people. We would also  not be fulfilling our duties and roles as chiefs and society members.  So we went in together as a group, and we walked in and introduced him  and signed the guest book as Cheyenne chiefs and headsmen. Then we  called him over to the painting, went over to the front of the painting and  we looked at it, and we asked him specific questions.    Who gave you  permission?    and,    Why did you paint it?    He said,    I   ve got a good  friend who   s Cheyenne. He gave me permission.    The next question  was,    Have you ever been to a Cheyenne Sun Dance,    and he said,     No.    Then we asked him if he was Cheyenne, and he said,    No.    So we  told him,    Well, what gives you the right as a non-Indian, non-  Cheyenne, to paint this?    He said,    Well, I   m aware of the Sun Dance. I  read about it, so I felt like I could paint it. What do you want me to do?     I said,    You need to take it off display, put it in the back. Just take it out  of the showcase window and put it away. Honor our requests that way.  But, too, you   re making money.    This painting was listed at forty, fifty  thousand dollars.    You   re making money off of these types of paintings.  You   re calling it Cheyenne when it   s not produced by a Cheyenne, but  yet you   re calling it Cheyenne to enhance the value of it to collectors.  You   re making money off of it, and that   s inappropriate.  If you truly want to help our people, donate some of that money to our  people, to the elder, to the youth that have needs, their general welfare  needs. We   ve got people at home suffering from illnesses. We   ve got  people at home that may not have nothing to eat right now. If you were  to turn that into a scholarship or some kind of fund to help our people,  maybe we   d appreciate you trying to not just make money off of us but  give back to our people. You could help that way.    He said,    I   ll get  back with you guys on it,    and to this day, we   ve never heard from him.  But he did move it from the window.  Yes, he did. I took a picture of it hanging in the window, which I still  have. I   ll e-mail it to you if you want. You   ll have it for your file. I went  back the next day and took the picture of the same window, and it was  gone. So he did honor that request. At the same time, when we were at  the reception, when he was standing there talking to us looking at the  painting, guess what he was doing. Big bottle of beer, drinking, and I  said,    That   s another thing.    So anyway    (Laughter)  You   ve curated a number of shows in collaboration with museums, but  there was one you did with the Denver Art Museum, Cheyenne Visions  20  Yellowman  II, in which you brought together traditional work that the museum had,  museum holdings with contemporary Native artists. Can you talk about  that a little bit and how you got the idea for that?  The first curation show, I had no idea what curator was, or what it was  like to curate an exhibit, a show. I went to Chicago Field Museum.  There was a guy by the name of Robert Spooner, the late Robert  Spooner, and he was curating the Arapaho show. He had died suddenly  halfway through the show, putting the show together. I happened to go  up there that summer and looked at the collections. Dr. Jonathan Haas, I  got acquainted with him when he came through Oklahoma. He was  wanting to get in touch with Cheyenne people and Arapaho people, so  he called me. He said,    Hey, Gordon, I have a dilemma here. The guy  that was curating the Arapaho show, he suddenly died, and we   ve got to  finish this show. Give me some suggestions.     I said,    You can probably call some of the Northern Arapahos and get  their guidance and suggestions,    and he said,    I   ll do that.    He didn   t  call me back for about two or three months, and he said,    I haven   t  gotten a response. Can you come finish this show for me?    I said,    Yes,  I   ll do that.    I went up there for a week and finished the Arapaho show  for him, and it went on exhibit as planned. He called me, he said,    I  appreciate you seeing this show through. It was a success. What can I do  for you now?    I said,    I want to curate my own show.    So then I go to  the Field Museum, and I worked with the collections for 870 objects in  there that are Cheyenne, somewhere around that number, and I got to see  every one of them.  I curated my own show there. I spent two weeks pulling collections and  photographing, and I had to visualize what I was going to do. That was  where I began Cheyenne Visions I. I wanted to call it Cheyenne Visions  I because not only is it the vision of the people of our past but it   s the  vision of our future Cheyennes. I had to do it creatively, to express what  I was trying to do. That   s where I did, at the Field Museum with  Cheyenne I.  Then the Denver Art Museum called me and said,    We really liked that  show. Can you do Cheyenne Visions II here?    I said,    Sure.    So we  wrote a grant. Matter of fact, Ben Nighthorse Campbell was involved  and provided some of that grant funding through his foundation, and  he   s Cheyenne. I went up there, and I curated that show, and it just kind  of went on its own. I looked at the collections, I separated the women,  the men   s, the boys    and different society things, and started putting  together the contemporary transition of history, but contemporary  Cheyennes.  21  Little Thunder  Yellowman  Little Thunder  Yellowman  We merged them together to reflect we   re still a living culture. We never  went anywhere. That was my whole point in showing them who we are  as Cheyenne, our communities. We   re still here as societies. We   re still  here as bead workers. We   re still here as song people, and we   re still  here as ceremonial people. We haven   t gone anywhere. We   re still living  and breathing, and it   s that culture that reflects our identity as Cheyenne  people. That was my whole goal in that.  I had other museums inquire, like Sam Noble out of Norman. They  agreed to be number three. Then the National Museum of the American  Indian, at that time Rick West was the director, and he agreed to be four.  Who knows where it   s going to go from  here ? That was my whole  point, to make it evolve and keep going. Buffalo Bill Cody wants to be  five. It takes a long time to plan a show because museums    exhibits, they  go on books. They   re scheduled two to three years in advance. In the  meantime, you   re looking for funding. Their exhibits are major, and  you   ve got to be on their schedule three, four years in advance. It   s not  just something that,    Oh, let   s do it this year, and then we   ll show next  year.    It   s not like that. I learned that. (Laughter) It   s a hurry up and wait  thing.  Shifting to your philosophies and practices of art, these days is your  principle media still water media?  Yes, watercolor.  You mostly work on paper? Do you do canvas sometimes?  I paint on canvas just to keep the feeling. I took a class at OU, a painting  class, under Professor  Edgar  Heap of Birds, and he said,    You   ve got  to get back to painting. You   ve got to get back to canvas.    His whole  point was    Get back to canvas.    It was twenty years since I   d been  painting on canvas. It   s like I had to relearn myself. I had to learn the  feel and texture of it. Not only that, but the scale of it. It was frightening.  I sat there and struggled with it and struggled with it, and pretty soon I  just said,    Oh, I   ll do this.    He said,    Just paint what you   re feeling. It  doesn   t have to be perfect.     My assignment was to do four paintings: two personal and two  exploratory. The personal ones is what got me the grade, and that came  later. All he wanted me to do was feel the paint, feel the brush, and feel  the canvas. He really made me understand what that meant, feeling that,  and the texture. Now I   m not afraid to go back to it because I started out  painting on acrylic, using acrylics. I started out painting big. Now I   m  getting comfortable where I want to go back to canvas, but right now, I  do my ledger work on watercolor ledger and technical illustration pens  22  Little Thunder  Yellowman  Little Thunder  Yellowman  Little Thunder  and pencil on cold press archival paper, 150-pound cold press.  You   ve got to understand the quality of the paper for collectors, for acid-free  paper. You   ve got to understand all of that language. You   ve got to  know that when a collector buys it, they   re going to ask you specific  questions. What   s it on? Is it archivable? Is it acid free? You   ve got to  know all of your thicknesses and weights so you understand that.  You   ve got to understand the type of paints you   re using. Is it different  trades of paint? There are certain paints that are going to last longer than  the other. I never knew that. There   s some that may be poison.  Understanding the supply as a painter, the paint set you   re actually  working with, and through experience, which ones are good and which  ones aren   t. I   m comfortable with the one I use now and the brushes.  Back then when I first started, I had TG Y camel hair brushes.  (Laughter) It   s so frustrating, the quality. You   re going to pay thirty,  forty bucks a brush, especially on a wash brush. I didn   t know what a  wash was. I didn   t know how to do a wash. I learned that at OSU.  When did you take the class with Edgar?  That was in 2008. I   m currently continuing my education at OU,  University of Oklahoma. I took art history courses and anthropology  courses, so I   m still in school. The last couple of years, I got the Rick  West art scholarship. The art scholarship was a way to pay for my  tuition, but I was honored to be the scholarship recipient.  I teach at the Cheyenne Arapaho Tribal College  Weatherford . I   ve  been there since 2005. When they first contacted me, they said,    We  want you to teach this class because we want someone in there that   s not  only going to know the traditions of Cheyenne Arapaho people but as an  artist. We want to develop our program into providing this type of  traditional art and really understanding the history of our people to  provide that to the students. Kind of unique in its own self. This is my  sixth year in teaching at the tribal college at Southwestern.  Is it a combination, history, applied traditional art?  I apply the arts through time, from rock art to buffalo hide painting, the  animal itself, the animal, the hide, the hide painting. But in between that,  there   s a process. You   ve got to skin the animal. You   ve got to stretch it.  You   ve got to tan it, and then you   re going to paint it. It   s important to  know all of those steps of traditional art, and you   re not going to find  that in a book. It   s hands on. To me, that   s the value.  Do you do preliminary sketches before you start to work on a piece of  23  Yellowman  Little Thunder  Yellowman  Little Thunder  Yellowman  Little Thunder  Yellowman  Little Thunder  Yellowman  Little Thunder  Yellowman  ledger art?  Yes, everything   s up here in my mind. I visualize it here, and then I   ll do  thumbnail sketches. Once I do a thumbnail sketch, it   s down. Then I   ll  start doing the sketches on paper. Then I   ll come in with the next step.  I   ll ink. After I ink, then I   ll paint.  How important are titles to your work? Do you ever get an idea for a  title before you see the image?  It depends on what the request may be. They   ll tell me what they want,  and then I   ll produce it, and then I   ll have the title.  Like for a book cover or a commission?  Yes, a book cover or a special commission. I   ve already got it up here,  and I just need to put it down here. Right now, currently, I   ve been  commissioned to do a painting at the new Oklahoma Supreme Court  building. It   s up here right now. It hasn   t gone to paper, but it will here  shortly. I   m going to start it.  Will it be more of a large-scale painting?  It   s going to be a large-scale painting, and they already told me what  they wanted. They even took me over there to see the wall where it   s  going to go.  Will it be a mural?  No, it   s a painting. They wanted me to see the color of the room, and  they wanted me to put colors that   s going to reflect that room.  Narrative is obviously important to ledger art, but is it more challenging  to tell a story through ledger art, or realistically, or does it just depend?  I think the ledger art is probably more accurate and very simple. You   re  going to have very simple designs, very simple lines, whereas a realistic  one, your challenge is going to be to reflect that realistic image.  Sometimes you can   t really do it because sometimes you see it as self  portraits. Sometimes you see it as an image that may be a still image  when, in fact, you   re trying to express the life of it. Being simple is very  important. One of the famous quotes that less is more. When I see it, I  try to be simplistic in what I   m saying because if you add on more to it  than it really needs, you   re losing the subject matter, but you   re also  going on the side of what they call gaudy. You   re adding things on there  that don   t need to be on there. So you   ve got to be very careful with how  24  Little Thunder  Yellowman  Little Thunder  the simple message of what you   re doing in your art, but being very  clear, and that bold color plus the fine lines, the contrast of the lines is  very important and what makes it pop out at you as a piece of art.  We   ve kind of talked about your creative process a bit, in the sense that  once you   re in the groove, you   ve got to protect your time if you   re  inside your mind. Tell me a little bit about how your creative process  goes, like from the time you get an idea. Do you keep a notebook of  sketches, or just walk through it?  I keep a journal, my own personal journal, with some of the  contemporary things that are happening now. Like when we lose a chief,  I   ll write the chief   s name down. I   ll write some notes of what I might  know of that person. If there   s something like the ceremonials going on,  something that I do, I   ll highlight that. If I   m going to be sketching  something, I   ll definitely put down symbols. I   ll sketch something that   s  going to remind me of what I have up here. It all comes out together  because you   ve got it up here, and you can visualize it.  Like with this painting I   m going to do with the Supreme Court building,  it   s up here. I envisioned the camp circle, but I also envisioned the  chiefs. It   s going to be reflecting what we call the justice systems among  the Cheyenne people, how we handle the violations among our own  people, violations of other enemies, violations of traditions. Some  people call it restorative justice, whereas me, I   m going to call it  traditional justice because it   s a system that   traditional law is very  powerful, and traditional law has existed before written law. That   s  going to elevate a higher level of dealing with the justice system.  When you violate traditional law, the punishment or the sentencing is  harder for us in the traditional system than it is the civil, the white man,  the law, the federal law, the Indian law, the state law, the county law, the  city law. Our tradition is very high. It has a high standard. You   ve got to  maintain that justice system because a lot of that   the most punishment  you can ever get or receive from that is humiliation and understanding  that, but that   s how we are as people, Cheyenne people. So I   m going to  paint an image of that system. There   s going to be several cases. I   ve  already done my research. One   s going to be about the young lady that  aborted her child, and the other one   s going to be about one of the  warrior societies that violated   he went hunting when he wasn   t  supposed to. He didn   t wait on all the warriors. He went on his own, and  he paid a price for that. It   s case studies of our history.  I look forward to seeing that. Looking back on your career, what   s been  one of the pivotal moments, kind of a fork-in-the-road moment?  25  Yellowman  I think one of the fork-in-the-road moments was losing that getaway,  losing that stress-free time to get away and just enjoy it. Today among  our people, money, we have to have money to eat. We have to have  money to get gas to go to work. We have to have money to pay the light  bill, pay the telephone bill. Money is very important economically, that  helps us live comfortably. It   s not much, but it   s among us. You can   t  live without it.  The economic side of it was, you get discouraged. If they say,    I want  twelve paintings next month,    you just laugh at them, say,    Yeah, right      (Laughter). It   s frustrating. At the same time, I try to keep in mind the  appreciative. People appreciate it. The appreciation of my art, it  increases the value. That was sort of the fork in the road for me.  The other thing, meeting that fork in the road, was the formal education  and the informal. I saw two worlds there. I was living one, and I had to  learn to educate. I learned that formal education is very important. If I  can do it, then so can others. I want to be the model of that educational  side of it, too.  You   re never too old to learn, but education is important. Stay in school.  Utilize your art, your talent, whatever it may be. Utilize your talents to  exceed yourself, to make yourself a better person. Education for me,  from sitting there, waiting for my senior year in high school to get  recognized by an art teacher to   it   s funny because it   s kind of come  full circle. When I was first hired at Southwestern Oklahoma State  University Tribal College to teach art in the Art Department there, Joe  London was the director at Southwestern. He was dating my high school  art teacher. They became friends, and he said,    Do you know Judy  McCombs?    I said,    Yes, that was my high school art teacher.     So in a sense it   s like,    I know she put in a good word for me. Thank  you  Thank you     (Laughs) It was full circle to the education she gave  me. She gave me the opportunity and enrolled me. Here, twenty, thirty  years later, her name comes up again. It   s like,    Yes, I know her.    It   s  like she was always in my life, and she still is. I know if she wasn   t my  high school art teacher, I probably wouldn   t be at Southwestern. You  think of those kind of things, understanding how much they really saw  the artistic value in what you have. They were the ones that helped you  along, and it was up to you to accept that help and run with it.  He retired from Southwestern, and she was working. I don   t know if  she   s still teaching there at the school at Chickasha, the art school there.  It was kind of funny when he called me on the phone and he says,    Oh,  by the way, do you know Judy McCombs?       That was my high school  art teacher     He said,    Yes, I   ve heard. I   ve heard.    (Laughter) That was  26  Little Thunder  Yellowman  kind of full circle.  We   re going to take a look at some images that you   ve done. Is there  anything you   d like to add or anything we forgot to cover?  Well, one of the things I always remember is as an artist, whether it   s  music, dance, song, or singing, whatever it is, always take full advantage  of that. Learn more and more about it. Study it, study it. Read. I learned  different expressions of art through different thinkers. I certainly learned  that at University of Oklahoma. You can add a lot to that, too. You bring  into that realm of education from what your knowledge is, how you  produce or how you express art. It   s not just a medium. It   s a form of  expression. It   s the beauty of who you are, but it   s also the beauty of  your people and your culture, your language.  Never get discouraged. Yes, you   re going to get frustrated. You get  frustrated in everything you do in life, but there   s always a positive that  comes out of it. When you get to that point of understanding what I   m  saying about the positive, the comfortable, you   ve elevated and reached  that goal of what you set. That   s the payoff. That   s the appreciation of    I  did it.    Never say,    I can   t do it.    Always say,    I am going to do it.     If it   s not for you as an individual, do it for your people. Do it for your  family. Do it for the children that   s going to learn from your art. They   re  going to look up and say,    He did his artwork for us.    That   s what I   d  like to see, remembering that art is a beautiful thing. It   s an artistic gift  that the Creator gives us. Always share that gift. Don   t ever keep it to  yourself. Share it because it doesn   t just belong to you. It belongs to the  people.  One of the things that I   ve always admired in artists is they   re still doing  it and just keep doing it. I   ll keep doing it as long as I can continue to be  creative, as long as I can continue to relate a story through a sketch or a  painting or a photograph. I   m starting to do photography now. I   ve won  awards in my photography, and it   s a new media. It   s starting to go that  direction, so I experiment. There   s nothing wrong with experimenting.  But I just want to say I encourage all the youth to continue their  education and never forget where they come from, who they are, and  who their people are.  One of the things that I want to say is I certainly want to say thank you  to my mother and father for challenging me and discouraging me and  saying,    No, you didn   t.    That was their way of making me do it and do  it and do it. I thank them for it now. I didn   t know that   s what they were  doing, but that was their way of teaching me. I want to say thank you to  my mom and dad for doing that. I still remember a lot of the things that  27  Little Thunder  Yellowman  Little Thunder  Yellowman  Little Thunder  they taught me, and I learned from it.  There was also something else I was going to mention. The most  distinguished award that I   ve ever gotten was being the Red Earth  Honored One. I got nominated, and my brother-in-law who   s an artist as  well as other artists said,    Gordon, you   re too young. You   re too young  to get recognized as the Honored One.    I thought about that, and then I  said,    No, look at it this way. I   m the youngest artist, the youngest artist  to ever receive this award,    and I challenged it.  It   s for not just your individual artwork but also what you   ve done for  the Native arts.  My contributions to art, yes, so I put it back on them. I was the fifth  Cheyenne to receive that. To me, that was an honor. To be in the names  of Doc Tate Nevaquaya, Archie Blackowl, Dick West, to be part of that  list, it made me feel proud to be Cheyenne. It also made me proud to be  a distinguished artist among that caliber of artists. I always look at things  like that, from a positive, and now I challenge other young artists.    Go  and get it. Go and do it      Great. You want to tell us the title on this one?  This is titled Sand Creek. It was a contemporary painting that I   ve done.  The top represents the before, and the bottom represents the after. The  before and after is very powerful. Very peaceful village, and then it turns  to chaos and massacre at the bottom. I wanted something to express the  contemporary view of Sand Creek 1864 massacre by Colonel John  Chivington. He led his troops against a peaceful Cheyenne village of   Chiefs  Black Kettle and White Antelope, and this was my  interpretation of that scene.  Green represents the life of the Cheyenne, and the Cheyenne refer to that  day as    The sky was filled with blood.    Then the soldiers burning our  village, I burned the paper on the bottom to highlight the effect of the  burning. The four hands that are mutilated represent the mutilation of the  Cheyenne, the Arapaho, but it also reflects one of our traditions. When  we lose a loved one, especially the mothers would lose a son in war,  she   d cut off her finger. That day, a lot of our ancestors    blood was shed,  so I wanted to burn the paper on the bottom. Before I did that, I said a  prayer. I knew that I only had one opportunity to burn it. Either it was  going to burn too thick or too light, so I prayed before I lit the match. I  used a big kitchen match, and it came out the way it   s supposed to.  Very powerful. How about this piece, Gordon?  28  Yellowman  Little Thunder  Yellowman  Little Thunder  Yellowman  This is a piece I done this past year, one of my latest ones. It depicts the  Calumet Lady Chieftains that won the state basketball championship.  They defeated the Cyril Pirates. The Calumet Lady Chieftain, she has  the war bonnet. She   s got the school colors, and the horse has got the  orange school colors. She   s got her Nike moccasins on. It was an image  that I donated to their fundraiser. I wanted to highlight them. The dots  represent all the team members on the horse.  This was one of the pieces you had at Southern Plains?  Yes, I wanted to depict the trade blanket, how the women would always  dress themselves around that time of Bent   s Old Fort, because that   s  where the original parasols came from. It reflected that they were all  talking Cheyenne to one another. You can just imagine their  conversations. Their parasols of color were a social icon of their  richness, of the ability for their husbands to trade for the parasol. They  had to be extraordinary hunters to trade hides for their things at Bent   s  Old Fort. They   re talking, telling stories among one another, and they   re  Cheyenne women, so that was just something that they   re content,  they   re happy, but they   re beautiful.  And the eagle feathers on the parasol. All right. Thank you so much for  your time today.  Thank you.  -------  -------
