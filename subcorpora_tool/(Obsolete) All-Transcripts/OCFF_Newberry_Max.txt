 Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Today is Thursday, June 12, 2014. My name is Juliana Nykolaiszyn.  Also with me is Tanya Finchum, and today we   re in Norman, Oklahoma,  interviewing Max Newberry with the Newberry Ranch in Harmon  County, Oklahoma. This interview is being conducted as part of the  Oklahoma Centennial Farm Families Oral History Project. Max, thank  you for joining us today.  Thank you.  Well, let   s start by learning a little bit more about you. Could you tell us  how your family came to Oklahoma?  My grandfather came from Greeneville, Tennessee, when he was about  twenty-three or -four years old. He came along with his brother and a  cousin by train because he heard about some land that was available for  homesteading in what was then Greer County. They came by train to  Quanah, Texas, and then bought some horses and came up to the  Shrewder community and filed on land adjacent to each other.  And why did they pick that particular piece of land?  I never really got to talk to my grandfather about that. Being young, I  wasn   t curious about things like that. (Laughs) It was probably about the  only places available, and it was fairly decent land. I don   t really know  the true details.  Can you tell me a little something about the Shrewder community?  The Shrewder community was a very vibrant community for many  years. It really didn   t consist of very much other than a country store,  blacksmith shop that my grandfather   s brother ran, (his brother was Jim)  and his cousin built the Shrewder store. The store had a post office about  5  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  a year or two after the store was built. The post office got there because  of the efforts of a man by the name of Shrewder, hence the name of  Shrewder rather than Newberry for the town. (Laughs) Later there was a  washer house with, as I recall, some thirty or forty washing machines.  That   s before people could afford to have their own, generally.  At one time there was a cotton gin adjacent to the town, and my dad  recalls the night that it burned down. He was only about seven or eight  years old, so that would be about 1910 or   12. It never was rebuilt. Later  on, a man who ran the store built another blacksmith shop adjacent to it,  and that   s still standing. That   s the only structure still standing. The old   store   s  concrete foundation  is still  there.  They also put in a roque court. Roque is similar to croquet except that it  is bounded by a sturdy concrete wall, and it has an angular perimeter,  and the wickets are like construction steel because the ball is a very  hard, small ball. That was a community gathering place. It was hard sand  that it was played on, and it took a lot of skill. When we think of the  croquet court we don   t think of any skill particularly, but with this, when  you saw a good player, you recognize that there   s a lot of skill involved  because they would ricochet that ball in a certain way and position  themselves and get the other person   s ball out of the way where they had  a good shot. It   s a lot of strategy involved if you were good.  I remember when I was growing up there, they had to get people to  come in and shop at the store. They had a wagon there where the local  musicians would get up there and play guitars and fiddles and sing as  best they could. It was the only entertainment we had, so we enjoyed it.  The store back then was what we call a 7-11 today. It had everything.  Gas, which you pumped yourself out of the old glass bowl. They would  make a bologna sandwich for you if you   d like. (Laughs) It was adjacent  to all of our land, and so it was real convenient if we had a cotton  shower, what we called a little  rain  shower. That was when you were  out there in the cotton field and you got to get out of the cotton field  because a little shower came over. You   d run to the store and get a Coke  or some  other drink .  Well, going back to your grandfather, and his name was Henry, correct?  Right.  When he staked his claim on the land, what were some of the first things  he did? What were his living conditions like?  He had to first dig a hole in the ground, the dugout hole. The depression  is still there. The first thing he did was dig that hole and build a top over  6  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  it to where he could see out and get light in. That was in 1900 when he  did that. He stayed in that by himself until he was married in December  of 1903. To help support himself during that time, he taught school in a  little town called Hester, which was about  fifteen  miles to the east. I  don   t think the town exists anymore. It was south of Mangum. My  grandfather Henry had two years of college in Greeneville.  Tusculum   College, I believe the name of it was. He was well educated for the time,  and he supplemented his income while he was developing the farm that  way.  Was it a one-room school, country school?  The Hester? I have no idea about that.  Okay.  Probably was.  Are you aware of some of his early crops he was trying to grow or to  cultivate?  Oh, I   m sure I didn   t have any conversations with him as such, but it is  very common in what we grew when I was growing up, and I   m sure it  was the same thing, was a cattle feed, sorghum. I know they had a  sorghum mill, so I know they grew sorghum. They had, of course, wheat  and cotton. I know he grew cotton, and I   m assuming he grew wheat  because that was a very common crop grown around there, and alfalfa  was also grown for the cattle.  And he met his wife in 19   he got married in 1903?  In 1903.  And how did he meet his wife?  Well, she lived, as the crow flies, one mile to the southwest. Her brother,  Riley Curnutt, came from Denton, Texas, and brought the family along.  Their father had died the previous year, so they brought their mother and  all the siblings along. They homesteaded there, and each one that was  old enough homesteaded land.  They  got to know each other that way.  Now, my grandfather, at that time when they got married, he was about  ten years older than her. He was twenty-nine, and Grandmother was  nineteen. The story  was  that my grandmother   s family was trying to  talk her out of it saying,    You don   t know what that man might   ve done  back in Tennessee, and you just don   t know his background     (Laughs)  They weren   t encouraging the union.  7  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  And what was her name?  Excy, E-X-C-Y.  Okay.  She was a very intelligent lady, as was my grandfather. Only had about  eight years of education but very, very brilliant.  And by the time they married, did he move out of the dugout?  He built a two-room house adjacent to the dugout. I   m sure he must   ve  built that when he found out they were going to get married because he  wouldn   t bring a wife into the dugout, a new bride at least. (Laughs)  They lived in that from 1903 to  1910  when the house across the street  was built. At that time they had four children, so they had to get more  space.  And how many children did Henry and Excy have?  They had five: two girls and three boys.  Okay.  My dad was the oldest, and then the youngest was born in 1915. They all  went to OSU, and four of them graduated with degrees. The other one  got married before she graduated. It   s interesting that my grandmother  Excy   s brother who had five children, they all got degrees. Two families  adjacent back in the 1910s and   20s all to have college degrees is very  rare, unusual.  Very, very much so.  Yes.  Well, did he continue to teach school and also work the farm?  Yes, he didn   t continue teaching in Hester. He only did that a couple of  years until he got married,  because  he had to ride his horse about ten or  twelve miles or further to that school and stay away. He quit teaching at  that point in time and began as the first mail carrier for the Shrewder  community. Excy   s brother was the first postmaster there at Shrewder.  His name was Riley, Riley Denton  Curnutt .  There were a lot of people in that area at that time because, you know,  8  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  they only homesteaded 160 acres. Well, families had at least four kids,  and some of them six or seven kids, so you multiply four times that and  you got twenty-five people at least per section. There was a lot of people  around there. In fact, they did a study that in the 1920s in Harmon  County there was thirty-three schools at one time. Of course, most of  those were only going to the eighth grade, and now there   s only one.  That happened in 1990 that all the schools were closed except for the  one at Hollis.  And how long did he serve with the postal service?  Well, he served for about, must have been at least ten years because they  closed the post office at Shrewder sometime around 1910 or so and  moved it to the Dryden community. He had to drive with his horse and  buggy about four or five miles to the Dryden community to pick up the  mail and then go out and deliver it.  Would he deliver mail by a horse and buggy?  Yes, I   ve got pictures of that, of him, which must   ve been pretty tough  in some of those winter weather, (Laughs) and he was farming at the  same time. At that time when he built the house across the street, across  the road, the Sears house, that was shipped into Quanah, Texas. People  think it was just a kit. Well, they sent you the blueprints and some of the  trim and things of that nature, but basically you had to be pretty handy or  have somebody that was. Grandfather was fortunate to have a neighbor  who was my grandmother   s kin to come over and help, so they built the  house themselves out of that. Beautiful house, it was the biggest house  around. It had a big front porch. It had four bedrooms upstairs with a big  foyer upstairs that the steps led up to. Downstairs we had two living  areas and two bedrooms and a bath and a big kitchen, big enough to hold  a dining area and a big pantry, and with a cellar where they kept all of  their canned goods and things of that nature. It was a real nice house  back then.  Did he have help putting everything together and building it?  Oh, yes. I really don   t know how talented my grandfather was in that  regard, but he had some people that were kin to my grandmother that  were very talented. They knew what they were doing. The foundation is  still there and in good shape.  Why did they choose the location across the street?  I really don   t know, but it was a good site. It was on a little rise, so I  assume it was just the best site around.  9  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Well, as your grandfather started progressing in his career with the  postal service, were they doing anything different on the farm? Were  they introducing anything new?  Grandfather was one of the first to do contour farming. My dad tells the  story that people kind of made fun of him because he was making  curves, and everybody said a good farmer made straight rows. (Laughs)  Well, my grandfather, some of his land was rolling and it was washing,  so he decided to do the contour farming. He did that, as well as putting  in terraces. We   ve tried to follow through with that. My father had a  good record of good soil conservation, and my brother and I did the  same thing. My brother partnered with me in the farming operation.  Neither one worked on the farm because we had other careers, but we  wanted to be part of the farming and operation, and we partnered with  other people who did the actual work. We received the conservation  award for the county back in the 1980s for the work we did.  Let   s talk a little bit about your father. His name was Earl     Earl.     and you told us he was the oldest.  Yes.  Did he share any remembrances with you about growing up on the  farm?  Oh, yes, he shared a lot of memories, I hope I can remember some of  them. I remember one vividly he told me. (Laughs) He was about four or  five years old, so this would be 1909. He was out on the road just across  from the house, and he sees this thing coming down the road. He didn   t  know what it was, and it scared him to death. He went crying and  running to his mother and says,    There   s a buggy coming down the road  without horses     (Laughs) I never will forget that story.  I remember when the plane carrying the space shuttle back to Altus   Oklahoma  to refuel on its way to Florida. It was flying over the farm,  and it must   ve only been at about two thousand feet because it was  making its approach to Altus. I could vividly see that 747 carrying that  shuttle and thinking,    This is the same spot where my dad was scared of  the car. How much has changed.    This was in 1980s, so that was only  seventy years or so past.  Another thing, Grandpa Henry, he chewed tobacco, and Dad was  1 0  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  cautioning to me as I grew up. He said,    You know, I never smoked, and  the reason I didn   t was because I was always pestering my father when I  was about eleven or twelve years old,    Let me chew tobacco, too     Of  course, he never would give it to  him  until finally he got tired of  him   pestering him, and he says,    Okay, Earl, but you got to do it right. Now,  take a big chew off of this and chew it for a couple of minutes, and when  it gets real juicy take a big swallow.       (Laughs) He said,    Of course I  got sick, and I couldn   t ever stand to be around tobacco again.    (Laughs)  Did he have specific chores he had to do growing up?  Yes, back then that   s one of the things you did when you grew up.  Everybody had a lot of things to do. You were busy basically from  sunup to sundown. There was always cows to milk and chickens and  pigs to feed. I remember we grew every kind of animal that existed, it  seems like, that you grew on a farm, even sheep. There was always  something to do.  Did he ever go out on the mail route?  No, by then Granddad had quit the mail route because they had built this  Shrewder school a half a mile to the north of our homestead. My  grandfather donated the land. It was on that original homesteaded land.  He donated the land for the school, and they built the school there. That  must   ve been in the early teens. The original school adjacent to  Shrewder store was a one-room school, went to the eighth grade, and it   s  called Blue Goose. That was the original schoolhouse for the  community, and they outgrew that. It must   ve been about 1910 or so that  they built this new big school. It was a big one with four large rooms,  two on top and two on the bottom, and I   ve got a picture of all the  people that were in school at the time. There was at least 100-120 people  in that picture. My grandfather taught there for a number of years. After  he gave up the mail route, he taught at the Shrewder school I guess for  another ten years or so.  That school only went to the tenth grade, and it wasn   t accredited. Dad  was going to go to college, so he needed to get a high school diploma  from an accredited school. He and his cousin, R. D. Curnutt Jr., were the  same age. They went to Mangum to school, and they boarded there to  get the last two years of their high school. My father and R. D. were  both superintendent of schools at Gould later on, and R. D. eventually  bought the land where his father was, where Excy had grown up. He  farmed and taught, also. My father and R. D. basically stayed together  all their lives until their eighties. They lived close to each other, very  close.  1 1  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  With education being important with your grandfather, did he  encourage Earl to go to college?  Oh yes, yes. There was no question that all their kids were going to go to  college.  And why Oklahoma A M?  Because it was agricultural. They related to that. Basically all of my  family has all gone to OSU. It was like we never considered OU.  (Laughs) Although, my son has a law degree from OU, and my daughter  has a nursing degree from OU. It   s interesting. They were republicans.  My Grandfather Newberry was widely known and respected in the  community, but he was a republican. He ran for office down there a  couple of times but never was elected. That   s how strongly democratic  they were. Now, Excy   s family, they were democrats, strong democrats.  To this day, they stay democrats, and our side stays republicans.  (Laughs)  Makes family gatherings fun. (Laughter)  Oh, they didn   t really talk politics that I heard of any. It   s strange how  you just accept things that your family does, and without question that   s  what you are. At least it used to be that way.  Well, after college what did your father end up doing?  My father went two years to Oklahoma A M. Then in order to get  enough money to keep on going to school, he came back to Harmon  County and taught in the local schools there in the Dryden area one year.  During that time, he started dating my mother, who had a job as a teller  in the Gould bank. My father didn   t think that she would date him and  actually was afraid to ask her for a date, but finally did at the urging of  one of his friends to go on a double date. Once they had one date, that  was it. They stayed together. My mother says he   s the first boy she let  kiss her. That was in  1925 . She was twenty-one years old. (Laughs)  Now, what was her name?  Verl.  Verl.  Verl Atteberry. That   s interesting: Verl and Earl, Newberry and  Atteberry.  1 2  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  And did he ever return back to school to finish?  Oh, yes, he went back soon thereafter and finished his bachelor   s degree  and then became a teacher at Gould. He was a teacher and a coach. I  don   t know how he ever was put into a coaching position because the  Newberrys were never athletic, and he wasn   t an athlete. He told me he  read the books, and he could understand what was important in  coaching. He became a very winning coach.  What did he coach?  He coached basketball, wrestling,  and  football. It wasn   t  eleven -man  because there wasn   t enough people. They went to state in basketball.  They went to the finals, and they played Tulsa Union. At that time, they  weren   t classed in A, B, C. They had to play the big schools, and they  got in the finals.  Did he help out on the farm when he returned from college and started  teaching?  He bought land.  Okay.  No, he didn   t. He  was  fully occupied because he had such a good  record coaching that an adjacent school in Olustee wanted him as their  coach. They lured him away. People would try to keep him there in  Gould because they said,    If you stay here another year or two, you   re  principal now, and we will make you superintendent.    My dad decided  to go to Olustee. His teams didn   t win there, and they fired him after two  years. (Laughs) He ended up as principal in Altus, and he was there for  about a year and then came back to Gould as superintendent.  He was superintendent there for about five years, and one of the  buildings burned down while he was superintendent. My dad was always  so proud that they were able to rebuild the school building (and it was a  big building, contained a gymnasium and four classrooms) without  going into debt. That building is still standing. It   s the only one still  standing there. This is back in the mid-  30s. While Dad was  superintendent there, he built a telescope, and that was one of his  hobbies. It was a twelve-inch reflector, and he did that all by hand.  That   s about the maximum a human can possibly do by hand. Dad was  very, very patient, and he ground that to perfection. I   ve got pictures of  that, and he said he could see the head of a nail from about two miles  away with that.  1 3  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  He went back for his master   s degree at Gunnison  Colorado  in  1938  and  1939. He didn   t have money for the tuition, but they were wanting  you to get your master   s if you were going to be an administrator. He  had to get his master   s, so he went to the president of the university there  in Gunnison and said,    I   ve got a telescope, and I understand you   re in  need of one for your astronomy classes. I   d like to trade you this  telescope I made for my tuition and room and board.    The president  said,    Well, I   ll have you know I am a professional astronomer, and I  know what a good telescope is, so don   t try to fool me with your  telescope.    Dad said,    I   m glad to hear that. You   ll appreciate it, then.     He was impressed with it, and so they made the trade. They used that  telescope in the college instruction for many years. Dad went back there  in the    80s to see if it was still there. He got ahold of one of the  professors, and they said,    We don   t use that anymore for astronomy,  but we use it in physics, the lens itself, and we still use that.    Dad was  very pleased with that. He made telescopes all of his life. In fact, I   ve  got an eight-inch one. He made three of them for each of us boys. He  donated telescopes to about four universities. Very talented, very patient  in that way.  Well, while he   s, you know, working in education, what   s happening  back on the farm? There   s lots of kids coming up behind him, so what   s  going on with Grandmother and Grandfather?  Well, they had four other kids, and they were about two years apart, and  so they were very busy. They ended up getting a hired hand that lived in  the house, the original house, that they built. When their kids left, they  had to have more help because Granddad was teaching and acquiring  more land. Of course, during that time they was getting more  mechanized, and so they can do things better. You know, 160 acres in  southwest Oklahoma, you just can   t make it with 160 acres, and people  found that out pretty fast. You could when the weather was right, but  when you had a couple years    drought, you had problems. One of the  problems  they  had was  mesquites . When they got there, there wasn   t  that many mesquites.  There was mesquites there because the cattle drives coming from south  Texas spread them, spread the mesquites up through that area, when they  were driving the cattle up to Kansas. As the droughts hit and they had  cattle that kept on eating, (and they didn   t know that much about what  they were doing to the grass because as you eat the grass down, the roots  go) eventually you haven   t got any grass. You got bare ground, and you  got no income. People would sell out, and because my grandfather was a  teacher he bought up the adjacent land. He got it up to about 800 acres     1 4  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Wow        adjacent to him. It was pretty tough times back then. They had to grub  out the mesquites with a team of horses and mules. Dad would talk  about they   d use the roots of the mesquite tree for firewood. Dad said  that that was just like coal as far as the heat it generated because the  mesquite tree is a very dense wood. They had to clear the land for  farming. There were mesquites there.  What structures were added as time progressed?  They had the chicken houses in the back of the house, pretty extensive  chicken houses. They ran several hundred head of chicken all the time.  They added a barn, pretty good sized barn. It was a two-level barn. They  milked cows. There was probably at least ten stanchions there where  they had cows they milked. That was pretty much it as far as any  structures on the farm. Those structures stayed until sometime around  the latter part of the    60s, and then they were torn down.  And what about water? Did they dig any ponds or     They dug them with a scoop that was handled. It was pulled by a   I  don   t know what they called it. It wasn   t a scoop, per se, but it was  pulled by horse, and they dug those little small ponds but adequate.  There was one right adjacent to the original dugout that they built. It   s  still there, silted in now. It was I guess in the    20s that they ran domestic  water to the farmhouse. Before that, they caught the water off of the roof  into the cistern. The cisterns are still there. They must   ve made them  very good because they   re still in good condition, still would hold water.  I guess they must   ve kept their gutters pretty clean because they drank  that water. (Laughs)  Then, of course, they put in windmills, and they put in a horse tank,  what we call a horse tank. It was for watering the horses adjacent to the  windmill. This horse tank was about four to five foot tall, was a concrete  one, and it was about fifteen foot long by about ten foot wide. That was  our swimming pool when I grew up. On Sundays it was a baptismal for  the local church. They used that for their baptism services. That was a  great little   we a lot of fun in that  tank .  Well, speaking about your youth, what year were you born?  Nineteen thirty-five.  Okay. Do you have siblings?  1 5  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Yes, I had two brothers that lived. I had a sister who died at four years of  age from a blood disease. Then I have an older brother that was born two  years before me who was the partner in the farm when Dad retired in  1970. My older brother and I decided we wanted to buy the farm from  him as an investment. My younger brother, who was in the military and  being moved around to different duty stations, didn   t think it was the  thing for him to get involved in. Many times as we experienced hard  times on the farm, I thought he was the real smart one. (Laughs) We  bought the farm from Dad when he retired. Dad retired in 1969, and we  bought the farm from him in 1970.  Now, what year did your dad get it?  Dad got the farm in 1944.  Okay.  I   ve got the ledger book. From Gould, he went to Martha as the  superintendent. In  1939 , he listed all of his assets and liabilities. He  figured his net worth was minus ten dollars, and he listed things even  down to the radio. He said,    You know, here I am  nearly  forty years  old. I got a master   s degree, and I   ve been superintendent for seven  years, and this is my net worth. I   ve got to do something different.    He  decided to go into the farming full-time. His dad was ready to retire, and  we went to the farm from Martha. He was putting in his first cotton crop,  and Dad hadn   t been associated with cotton farming since he was in high  school.  He was out in the middle of the field pulling goatheads out of the  cultivator in July. It was a hundred degrees and more, and the sweat bees  were swarming around him, and a guy walks up to him out in the cotton  field. It   s the local superintendent. He said,    Earl, I want you to come  and teach for me.    Dad said,    You know, I think I   ll do that and hire  somebody else to do this,    so he did. (Laughs) He got a hired hand who  lived in a house we had there, and he stayed with Dad for many years.  So in    44 the family moves to the farm. Do you move into the Sears  house?  Yes.  Okay.  Yes, and that Sears house, the front door had this beautiful etched glass  picture of Niagara Falls. Oh, it was a beautiful thing, and they were so  proud of it. My brother and I, younger brother Joe who I hadn   t  1 6  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  mentioned yet, two years younger than I, we got in a fight on the stairs  just above where that door was. I hit Joe or pushed him or something. At  any rate, Joe went tumbling down and hit that door and broke the glass.  Oh, we thought we were really going to get it. Dad was so brokenhearted  he didn   t do anything but just sit there with a sad look on his face. He  was so disappointed that he couldn   t even punish us. (Laughs) Of  course, we looked pretty sad ourselves, so I guess he knew how bad we  felt.  In the Sears house, where was your room?  My older brother and I were up there in two bedrooms. The other two  bedrooms which were occupied when my dad was growing up were just  used for storage.  And how was it heated?  There wasn   t any heating or air conditioning at all in the upstairs. Gee, I  remember many a night   of course, winter wasn   t a problem. You just  threw on another blanket, but in the summertime it was hot. Sometimes  we   d get the bed out on the front porch and sleep outside because it was  so hot. I never will forget my older brother, two years older, we were  both sleeping on this bed, and he said,    Don   t put your feet on me.    Of  course, sometime during the night I   d get my feet over there. He said,     We   re not going to sleep this way anymore with you getting your feet  on me,    and he got up and got a rope and tied my feet to the bedstead. I  let him do it. (Laughter)  Well, growing up on the farm, you probably had chores you had to do  yourself.  Yes. I was driving the tractor when I was twelve, thirteen. I remember  vividly driving it. Actually getting out and being by myself on the farm,  doing all of that, I guess I was more like thirteen or fourteen before I  was allowed to go on out there in the field by myself. I remember I was  about nine years old when we moved to the farm, so initially all I did  was pull cotton and chop cotton and things like that. I couldn   t wait until  I was old enough to drive the tractor to get out of that. That was hard  work. I guess you grew up faster in a farm then because I was driving  everything when I was thirteen or fourteen. I was driving a school bus  when I was fifteen.  How did that come about?  I was going to be school bus driver my junior year, so I   d taken training  for school bus. I was fully trained and capable. My brother was a school  1 7  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  bus driver but couldn   t drive for some reason, so I substituted for him  when I was fifteen. Got paid twenty-five dollars a month for that.  That   s pretty good back then.  Well, spending money. (Laughs)  Well, let   s talk about school. Where did you go to school at that point?  Three years in Martha. I finished school in Gould.  There were  only ten  in our class, but it was a good school.  How   d you get to school?   By  school bus. We lived toward the end of the route. We were about   eight  and a half miles from the school. Typically they couldn   t hire  anybody else other than students for twenty-five dollars a month. Then  they   d try to get a student who was that right age out at the end of the  route. So that   s what happened. My brothers all drove it  also . We   d get  up first thing in the morning and have to milk the cows, feed the  chickens, and feed the hogs and everything and then go drive the school  bus.  And then when you came home, what was on tap?  More work. (Laughter) Yes, there was always more work. Cows had to  be milked every morning and evening. Pigs and chickens had to be fed.  Cows had to be rounded up for milking, so there was always something.  During a lot of  winter days  we   d go out and fix fence. Dad kept us  busy. There was always a lot to do.  Well, at that time, how many acres did your father have?  It was 990.  Okay.  Back then, the equipment was very small. The one-ways that we used     we used one-ways back then, with a disc. They were only about eight  foot wide. I remember we would pull into a 160-acre field where we   d  plow, and we   d be there with three tractors running day and night for  several days. It just took forever, where today they pull in there, and in a  couple of hours they   ve plowed it.  Well, let   s talk about harvest time. What was that like, and where would  you take your crop?  1 8  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  We farmed wheat and cotton. With the wheat, we had our own combine.  Initially back in the    40s, the combine itself was only about six foot wide  to the auger, so it took forever to harvest your crop. Typically you had to  hire other people to help you do that. This is before self-propelled  combines. These were all drag-type. My father, back in the late    40s,  bought this Case combine that had an auger that was a good maybe  twelve to fifteen foot long. It was a drag-type, according to the height of  the wheat, you had to raise and lower it. You had to reach back and get  this lever. You drove with one hand and tried to adjust the auger to the  proper level  with the other hand .  The land had terraces, and some of it was rolling. That became very  difficult and nearly impossible to do, so Dad rigged up a seat that he  could sit on up where the grain bin was on the combine. He rigged up a  lever next to that seat where he could adjust the auger. Us boys would  drive the tractor, and he would adjust the grain auger. That worked real  good, except for one time we had this good wheat crop and we had a  tremendous amount of rain and wind. Back then, a good wheat crop  was   you knew your wheat was good when it stood about three or four  foot high. Because it was so tall, the wind and rain knocked it all down,  and it was all laying down on the ground, just laying there in a mat. Of  course, today a good wheat crop, the wheat is only a couple of foot tall,  and they don   t have that problem anymore.  We were trying to salvage that crop. Well, to do that, we had to drive  very slowly, and Dad would get that auger down as close to the ground,  just dragging on the ground. I was trying to be very careful because he  was leaning over watching and trying not to scoop up any rocks or  anything while he   s trying to save the wheat. We had this old 1928  Farmall Regular. It didn   t have the mechanism to keep a constant speed.  If you hit a gully or anything, it would lurch. Well, I was driving it and  doing the best I could, but I didn   t see this gully, and it lurched. Dad  went flying over the reel. I was able to stop the tractor before it hit him,  but I thought,    My gosh  Dad is really hurt bad,    but he wasn   t. He just  got up and dusted himself off and gave me a look. (Laughs) Didn   t say  anything, but his look was enough.  Wow. And where would you take your wheat?   To  Gould. They had two elevators there in Gould. At harvest time, it  was just unbelievable. The line to the elevators, of trucks, was a couple  blocks long. They had two elevators because the typical truck only  carried, like, 200 bushels. There was a lot of trucks lined up. The cotton  harvest was all hand-pulled bolls, so it was all very hard manual labor. I  never was very good with pulling bolls because I haven   t got any  1 9  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  athletic ability. I would typically pull 250 pounds a day. My buddies  who were really athletic would pull maybe 400-and-something pounds  because they were much more dexterous with it. That really matters a  lot, how athletic you are and your ability to see and grab bolls.  Would y   all hire some of the local kids or     Oh, yes, everybody had to have a lot of help. Yes, you   d hire maybe  fifteen or twenty people, how many ever you could hire, and you got  paid by the pound. Some of them, you   d pay them at the end of every  week, and they wouldn   t show up the next couple of days. They   d go  fishing. (Laughs) You knew not to depend on them. (Laughter)  Would you also take that to Gould?  What?  The cotton, where would you take the cotton?  Yes, that was primarily to Gould and sometimes to   they had a gin in  Russell. It was a little town to the east about four or five miles. Russell  had a gin cooperative. When you filled a wagon up, that would get you  about a 450- to 500-pound bale of cotton.  All right, so let   s talk about high school for you.  It was a very small class for me, and not many subjects were available to  you. You either took vocational agriculture or took home economics.  (Laughs) Your options were either biology or trigonometry, things of  that nature. It was a good school. We always had great teachers. A lot of  the teachers were local farmers. They   d grown up there, got their  education, and were excellent teachers. People don   t really understand  the advantage of some of these small communities having that kind of  talent, that some of the better educated people in the county teach and  farm. You get some excellent teachers.  And in high school you were involved with FFA  Future Farmers of  America ?  Yes, 4-H when we were younger, and then when you became a  sophomore you started in vocational agriculture. I was president of the  FFA in my senior year, as were my two brothers. We were all junior  master farmers. I   m very proud of that. That was the thing to do if you  were in the rural community back then. We never really had any  intention of farming for a living because we grew up and knew how hard  it was. (Laughter) We enjoyed the life, but we saw what my father went  2 0  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  through.  Fortunately, he had the ability to get a job and farm and had to do both  of them in order to survive because the teacher   s pay was very small,  and at many times things were very tough on the farm, particularly in the     50s with the drought like it was. Dad had started a brangus herd which  is five-eighths angus and three-eighths brahma, and beautiful cattle. He  had got a pretty good herd started, and we had, oh, at least five or six  years of drought, and he had to sell all of his cattle and at low prices. I  graduated in    53. It was a very tough time because basically the only  way you survived was going to the Altus Production Credit Association  back then and asking for a loan, so that   s what Dad did. I remember  many times hearing Mom and Dad discussing finances and how they  were going to make it. He had the income from  teaching .  I remember they even discussed whether I should go to college or not,  whether they could afford to let me go or not because they needed the  help on the farm. They didn   t have the money to send me to college, but  Dad said,    No, there   s no way he   s not going to go on to college right  now.    Fortunately, I had an aunt that lived there in Stillwater, and she  found this janitorial job for some doctors out by the hospital. It was a  good one because it paid seventy-five cents an hour where the normal  pay for janitorial work at the college was fifty cents an hour. I could  work as many hours as I wanted to. That   s the way I supported myself.  I got a hardship scholarship for the first semester, sixty-six dollars. That  was what the tuition was for a semester back then, and that included all  your athletic tickets, too, to the football games and basketball games,  everything. Sixty-six bucks was a lot back then, so we were real tickled  to get that money. Dad told me, said,    Now, Max,    he says,    you thank  Dr.  Oliver  Willham for that.       Okay, Dad.    Well, here an ol    country  kid on a big campus, how do you get to see the president of the  university or the college and thank him for it? It bothered me there for  several months. I hadn   t done what I told my dad I   d do. (Laughs) I said,     I got to figure some way to see the president.    One day I   m walking up  the steps of the Student Union, and Dr. Willham   s walking down. I stick  out my hand and then said,    Dr. Willham, I just want to express my  appreciation for the scholarship.    Of course, he didn   t know what I was  talking about. Then he recovered real fast and said,    Well, you   re  welcome, son.    (Laughter)  How did you get to A M at that point? What was your traveling like?  We bummed rides with people that had cars that lived in the vicinity. I  had a brother John who was two years ahead of me in college, and he  lived in Vet Village. He was married, and they had the old temporary  2 1  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  buildings out there on the west side of the campus that they put there  from World War II for the veterans. They called it Vet Village. It cost  forty-five dollars a month. It was a two-bedroom, living room, kitchen,  bath, and utilities for forty-five dollars. Well, my brother worked as a  poultry major and worked on the poultry farm for fifty cents an hour,  and he could buy eggs for a penny apiece.  He and one of his poultry major  friends  had this old garage, and they  hatched some eggs and raised chickens. Since he still couldn   t afford the  forty-five dollars, (I was in Cordell) I left the dormitory after one  semester and moved in with him since I couldn   t afford the dormitory. I  lived with he and his wife and under-one-year-old kid. It wasn   t a good  setup for either one of us. His wife, Wanda, was very resourceful. She  seemed like she had a hundred different ways to cook eggs and chicken  because that   s about all we ate was eggs and chicken. (Laughs)  And what was your major at A M?  Industrial engineering.  Why did you decide to go into engineering?  Well, I always liked mechanical things, and I was halfway decent in  math and those sorts of things, and I heard they made good pay. I really  didn   t know anything about the different engineering disciplines, and so  I initially started out to be an electrical engineer. After I took my first  course in electrical engineering, I decided,    I   ve got to change majors  because I don   t like this.    (Laughs) By that time, I   d found out about  industrial engineering and management.  So after you graduated what happened? What came next?  I graduated with a commission in the Air Force, and you   re obligated to  serve for three years. I qualified for a   I wanted to be a pilot, but they  gave me an aptitude test where they gave you different situations and  orientations, and I failed that. I couldn   t tell whether I was upside or  down, and I think it was a good thing to flunk me out, not put me into  flight school. They said,    Well you could be a navigator since you   ve  got the background in math and everything for that.    That was a five-year  obligation. I said,    I don   t want to spend five years telling  somebody where they   re going.    They said,    Well, you can be a  meteorologist.     Well, that really appealed to me because my dad   s brother had been a  meteorologist in the Second World War and, in fact, ran  weather recon   flights over Japan, preparation for the atomic bomb drop. He didn   t  2 2  Finchum  Newberry  Finchum  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  know it, but that   s what he was doing. He was volunteering for every  mission. Of course, they were shooting at him, but every mission that  come up, whether it was his or not, he   d volunteer for it because you got  so many points, you got to go back home. He was engaged to this lady,  and he wanted to get back home. Day after his last flight, they dropped  the bomb. (Laughs)  Any rate, I got interested in that and went to Texas A M for a year,  studied meteorology. At the time, the Air Force forecasted the weather  for the Army, and they assigned me to Fort Sill to do forecasting. It was  close to home, and I was dating this girl  so  I wasn   t disappointed to be  that close to home. Of course, as would happen, about a month later we  broke up. (Laughs)  What year did you graduate from A M?  Fifty-eight. At that time, it took five years because the ROTC was  twenty hours, and to get a degree in engineering with ROTC is a   I had  a total of 168 hours in the five years.  Was OSU by then?  Yes.  Would you go back home at all during that period and work, help out on  the farm?  Yes, I would when I didn   t have summer work as an engineering trainee.  I   d go back home and work. First year, I stayed at OSU, or Oklahoma  A M, and worked the clinic job because I had to have that job, and so I  had to work through the summer to keep the job. I took two courses  during the summer that first year. This is little bit on the side, but the  course was taught by a excellent teacher called    Square Root    Smith. He  was actually Dr. Smith,  and  he was a southern gentlemen. He gave  tough tests. He got his name of    Square Root    because  it was rumored   he averaged passing the square root of his class.  There were about twenty-five of us that came to class that first day, and  there was supposed to be another professor teaching the course. Well,  something happened. That teacher couldn   t teach it, so they assigned Dr.  Smith. As soon as he walks in, half the class got up and walked out. His  reputation was that  bad . The rest of us stayed for the hour and then got  together, and we said,    There won   t be more than two of us pass the  course, and there   s already two math majors in the course.    (Laughs) So  we said,    We got to drop the course.    We all went up en masse with our  drop cards to the head of the Math Department, and he says,    You guys  2 3  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  come back tomorrow, and we   ll talk this over.     We came back the next day, and the head of the department was there  along with Dr. Smith. He said,    It   s my understanding that you have no  problems with Dr. Smith as a teacher. Is that right?       Oh, no problems.        It   s that you   re concerned about the hardness of his tests. Is that right?        Yes.    Said,    Well, we have taken a study of everybody that   s taken the  course under every teacher for the past ten years, and we have got a   grade  spread, and that   s the spread we   ll apply to this class. Two of  you will get As, two of you will fail, one or two will get Ds       and blah,  blah, blah. He said,    If y   all accept that, we   ll go ahead.    So we did.  (Laughs)  What did you get?  Oh, I got a C. (Laughter) I was tickled to get it. There was two math  majors and a couple of others that were just   the majority of the class  got Cs.  At what point did you think, you know, as time goes on and you   re in  your career, that you   re going to go back and buy that farm?  I didn   t, until I was close to   I don   t think I ever really thought about  buying the farm or getting back to the farm. When Dad made the  decision to sell the farm, my brother and I decided it was a real good  investment, so we decided to partner in it. At the time, I was working for  General Electric in Chicago. When I got out of the Air Force, I went  back to OSU and got my master   s in industrial engineering and then  went to work for GE and worked for them in a training program for  three years which involved Louisville and Schenectady and Cincinnati. I  ended up as a manager of facilities and manufacturing engineering  activities for Hotpoint which is part of GE in Cicero.  It was at that time that my dad decided to retire. He decided he wanted  to sell the farm, and he needed  450 a month to supplement his teacher  retirement and social security. He said,    I want to sell it, and I want the  note for it for twenty years.    I got on the primitive computer at work     this is 1970. It was a very primitive computer, but I knew how to work  computers. I ran the program to see what the amortization schedule was.  That   s the way we developed the price for the farm. We agreed on the  price, which at the time was 990 acres and about  90,000. Along with  that came shares in two oil companies, royalty companies: Panhandle  Royalty and Farmers Cooperative.  Granddad Newberry, Henry, had traded forty  mineral  acres of land for  one share of the stock. We ended up with three shares of Farmers stock  2 4  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  and one share of Panhandle. That had been passed down through the  family to my dad when my dad bought the farm. Then, when dad sold  the farm to us, he gave us the shares, and my brother and I split the  shares up. I ended up with one share Panhandle and one share Farmers.  My brother John ended up with two  of Farmers . At the time, the stock  was worth  25 a share and paid a couple dollars    dividends. Nobody  thought much about it.  Well, things have changed, and Farmers stock is worth  100,000 for that  original share. I sold the Panhandle shares at  180,000. The reason I  know it was worth  25, when I filled out my income tax I had to call up  and see what they were selling for back in the    70s, and they said  25.  When I gave that information to my accountant, he didn   t believe it, and  he says,    You made a mistake there.    I said,    No. Went from  25 to   180,000.    Today it   s double that because they   ve really done great.  Did your father keep the mineral rights on his property?  Yes.  They were transferred to my brother and I .  Did they ever do any drilling?  Never did drill. They have drilled within a couple of miles, and they  would lease periodically and do seismic work there periodically but  never drilled. It   s interesting that they rarely ever  leased . I leased some  of the land back in 1980s for  25  for  five years. Then there hadn   t been  any leasing since then until two years ago. They offered me a lease for   200 an acre, three-sixteenths for three years and, if they wanted to re-lease  it  they could  for the same amount for two additional years. That  lease had not expired yet, so I don   t know if they   re going to. They   ve  leased up all of Harmon County, basically, all the southern part, but they  haven   t drilled any wells. They   ve got some problems with the pipelines  and things like that, I understand. Somebody asked me,    Well Max, have  you got any oil on your land?    I said,    Oh, yes.    The guy knew  better   ad I said,    They just haven   t found it yet.    (Laughter)  Well, in the 1970s you have ownership of this property. Are you still out  of state?   Yes , I stayed out of state for another year or so, and then I decided I  wanted to get back to Oklahoma. My brother  John  was living in  Dallas. He was a pilot for American Airlines in Dallas. He was  managing the farm. We had  partnered with  a boyhood friend of ours,  and he did the farming, a guy that we really trusted and knew would take  good care of the land. We went in partnerships with him, 50/50 thing. So  my brother managed it for three years until I got a job with Star  2 5  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Manufacturing and moved back here and moved into this house  in  Norman  in 1974. I got back, and my brother says,    Max, I   ve been  managing the farm for three years. It   s your turn to do it for three years.     Well, thirty-something years later, I still do it. (Laughs) My brother  really didn   t care much for getting involved in it. He turned  all financial  matters  over to his wife.  Well, let   s talk about changes during your ownership. You probably saw  quite a bit in terms of not only your crops and livestock but also weather  and the economy.  It had completely changed from the time when I grew up on the farm to  the way things were handled even in the    70s, and significantly changed  since then, of course. When I got back involved in it, I truly didn   t feel  confident in the farming as such because I   d been away from it so long. I  knew about it, but things had changed so much, the way they went about  harvesting the cotton, all mechanized. The way when I grew up you  chopped the weeds in the cotton and called it cotton chopping. I heard  some people actually didn   t know any better and chopped the cotton  when they went in. (Laughs)  Today they use chemicals to get rid of the weeds and everything. They  fly everything over in planes. We did have some chemical spraying, but  we would do it on a spray rig attached to a tractor to spray for insects but  not for weeds. We didn   t have pre-emergents back then like they do and  with no ability to mechanically harvest. Back in the late or the early    50s  they were doing some sort of sled-pulling kind of mechanisms to do  cotton harvest. By the time I got back to the farm, it was twenty-something  years later, and they no longer used one-ways. They used the  chisels for the land. The equipment was so much bigger and so much  more expensive  because  the farms were much bigger.  When we bought the land from Dad, it was 990 acres. My brother and I  felt like it was a good investment, so we added about another 800 acres  to it in adjacent land, adjacent to the original. It was necessary to do  those things. Everybody was doing that. We did it because we thought it  was a good investment, a good buy. That was in the late    70s, early    80s.  Back then price of the land (this was pasture land and crop land  together) was somewhere around  400 dollars an acre, and the interest  rate was something like 7 or 8 percent with Federal Land Bank.  It wasn   t but a couple of years later after we had made some sizable  investments in land that that changed. (Laughs) The interest rates went  to 13 percent. At the time, the interest on the farm was actually more  than I was making from my job as an engineer. We kept borrowing  money, and finally the Federal Land Bank said, when I called up for the  2 6  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  next loan to go another year,    No more loans. We   ve loaned you to your  full extent.    That was rather disturbing because that came at a time the  payment was due within about a month.  Fortunately, my father had saved up money. He began loaning us some  money. He could get better interest rates from us than he could from his  investments, so it worked out good for both of us. We were able to  survive those high interest rates and everything, but at one point in time  it became necessary to sell a piece of land because we couldn   t make the  payment. Actually, I came up with my part of the money, but my brother  couldn   t. He was an airline pilot and making good money and had other  activities, but one of his activities was developing land. When  everything went sour financially, so did his land development business.  The bank recalled his note on his development project which was pretty  sizable, and there for a year or so, he couldn   t make payments. Well, the  only way we could do it was to set up some land for sale. I picked out  the lands that were away from the original farmstead that would be best  to get rid of. We had our sale, and it was at a community building there  in Gould. There were two pieces of land. The auctioneer had given me  an estimate on what they would bring. He   s up there going through his  banter, and I   m thinking,    Yes, yes, yes.    I   m getting some bids, and  then a couple minutes go by, and he stops and waves at me to come up.  He said,    Max,    he says,    I   m going to close down the auctioning on  this piece of land.    I said,    Why? We   re getting good bids on it.    He  said,    We haven   t got a bid yet. I   ve just been acting like we   ve been  getting bids,  I am  trying to get people to  bid , but we haven   t got a bid  yet, and it   s about 20 percent below what we estimated. We   ll go on to  this other piece of land.    Well, the same thing happened with it. People  were really looking for bargains, and we couldn   t get enough money to  even pay back the Federal Land Bank, so we just called the sale off. I  went back to the Federal Land Bank, and they said,    Well, we   ll  restructure the note.    They did, but they increased the interest rate.  (Laughs) We were able to recover from that. My brother was able to  recover from his problem and make his payments, so we kept  everything. It was tough times.  Oh, yes. How did your father feel about what was going on?  This was at a point in time   I   m trying to remember. My father died in     93. He   d gone through the same kinds of things, and he understood it.  He was well familiar with what I was going through. (Laughs) He  commiserated with me, but we   d borrowed about all of his money, too.  (Laughs)  2 7  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  You sold the property in 2007     Yes.  Was that a hard decision to make?  Emotionally it was because I loved that farm. It   d been part of my life.  Since the late    70s, I had been working on the farm removing trees, the  mesquite trees. We had a lot of mesquites. We bought this old  dilapidated antique crawler tractor that my brother had found in Texas  that some construction company got rid of because they didn   t want to  fool with it anymore. It was built in the late    40s, so it was all  mechanical. We got it for  2,500, and my brother hauled it up from  Dallas to the farm, and I met him there at the farm.  I   d never been on a crawler tractor, and so I said,    John, do you know  how to drive this thing?    He says,    I   ve done it once.    I said,    Well,  how you do it?    So he got up there and showed me.    Pull that lever to go  this way and push on the brake.    I said,    Okay, let me try it.    I got up  there, and of course I was all concerned I   d run into something. He gave  me a five-minute lesson and said,    I got to get back to Dallas.    That was  the last time my brother was ever on that tractor.  It was  supposed to be  a joint project to run the tractor and grub out the mesquite trees.  Any rate, there was a local farmer there that had good mechanical  capabilities and a good farm shop, James Masters. I took the tractor over  to James, and I said,    James, I want you fix this thing up for grubbing.     He rigged up the grubber blade for the tractor, and (this is a shovel-type  tractor) he put on the cleats on the tractor, welded on the cleats, and put  a steel cab on top of it to give some protection  from  the limbs  on  the  mesquite trees. Like I said, it was a shovel tractor, and it turns out this  was only a fifty-horsepower, two-cylinder tractor, small one. I don   t  know how to grub mesquite trees, so I get out there and start trying to  figure out how to grub out the mesquite trees.  Well, after a couple of hours I figured out how to pull them out okay.  I   m out there, and a day or so later James comes by to see how I   m  doing. I   ve pulled out quite a few trees. He says,    I   ve got to tell you,  Max, all that time I was fixing up this tractor   I   ve grubbed mesquite  trees out with a lot of equipment bigger than this. I was sure this tractor  wouldn   t do it.    The reason it was able to do it is because it had that  hydraulic shovel lift. You go in about two feet before the root of the tree,  and you get that blade about two feet underneath the ground and grab  ahold of the root and then pull on the hydraulics  lever . That would  yank the tree  up and  along with the forward motion of the tractor  pull  the tree out . It would only do that, I found, when it was wet. If it was  2 8  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  dry, then the tree would snap off. If the tree would snap off, then the  next year you   d have this bush and you   d have a bigger problem with it  than you had before. You learned to only go down there when it was wet  to pull out the trees.  I did that all myself. I   d go down there on the weekends. I   d leave  Friday afternoon, get down there that evening, and work until the sun  went down. Then I   d work until Sunday until the sun went down, and I   d  drive back home. I   d camp out down there. It was so nice. You   d be  tired, and so nice to sit out there and enjoy the nightlight and see all the  stars and everything. I did that for about fifteen, twenty years, and I  actually grubbed out about a square mile of mesquite trees. The old  tractor finally wore out about the same time I did. (Laughs) I kept that  old tractor running. I didn   t know anything about diesel or crawler  tractors  initially , but I sure learned a lot.  You know, when you   re growing up on the farm you have to be able to  take care of yourself. There   s nobody there to help. You   re out in the  middle of the field, and nobody there to help you. We always took a pair  of pliers and bailing wire when I was growing up. Never went to the  field without a pair of pliers and bailing wire. Fixed most things with  that like you can with WD-40 today. (Laughs) There   s nobody around  there anymore. The closest house to Shrewder is, like, four or five miles  away. Nobody around there. The nearest town is Gould  at  eight miles,  and it hardly exists as a town anymore.  The nearest  towns are  Mangum and Hollis, eighteen miles away. When  I was doing that, my wife was always concerned because I   m out there  by myself and this is before cellphones. If something had happened to  me, she wouldn   t have known about it until I didn   t come back Sunday  evening. We were real tickled when cell phones came  out . (Laughs) I  could call.  There are a couple of things I want to ask you about. Holidays, what  were holidays like on the farm?  I don   t remember holidays on the farm other than fourth of July  firecrackers and Christmas, of course, but other than those,  Thanksgiving. Every day was the same, as the farm work had to be  done. There wasn   t any change in that. Wasn   t a day off. We did get  Sundays off. My family was very religious, and we never worked on  Sundays other than things that just had to be done, feed the cattle and  milk the cows. During harvest, Dad would harvest on Sunday, the wheat  harvest. Other than that, Sundays were free.  We would get to go to Hollis and see the show. I remember when I was  2 9  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  younger and not old enough to drive, we   d leave church in Gould. Mom  and Dad would go back to the farm, and I would hitchhike from Gould   eight miles  to Hollis. You   d always catch a ride right away. Everybody  hitchhiked those days. It was a real treat for me because I got to go to the  restaurant and order a chicken fried steak meal and go to the movie.  Then I   d hitchhike back for evening services at church. (Laughs)  Well speaking of food, did you have any favorite meals?  Well, chicken most of the time, and it was always good because it was  fresh. We raised our own chicken, and chicken had been killed that  morning. We always ate good. We raised our pigs and cattle. We always  had meat every meal. We had fresh eggs. I ate some fresh eggs the other  day, and they taste entirely different from what you get at the store. Of  course, the milk was always fresh. I never got to drink milk with cream  in it because Mom would always skim off the cream and I would churn  it to make the butter. Back then, you   d crank a paddle to make the butter.  We always drank skim milk. It was less than 1 percent. I   m sure of that.  Did she have a specialty she was just really good at?  She was a good cook, period. Rolls were great. I remember her rolls  being great. I think most farm ladies are good cooks. We had chicken a  lot. Well, we had meat all the time, but with Dad he liked the white  meat: the breast and the wishbone. We knew better than to touch those,  but Mom would always put them on his plate anyway. (Laughs) I don   t  think I knew what a breastbone tasted like until I left the farm. (Laughs)  Whose job was it to kill the chickens? Everybody has a technique, too.  I   m interested in the technique, as well.  Well, Mom didn   t want to kill chickens. Even back in Martha when we  had chickens, Dad raised chickens even when he was superintendent of  schools. Mom would have us take the chickens across the street to this  lady who would wring their necks. My brother and I decided one time  that it wasn   t necessary to do that, that we could kill the chicken.  Course, we were all of   let   s see. I was six, and he was eight. We  decided we could string that chicken up. We put a string around its neck  and put it over a limb and pulled it up. Of course it wasn   t working, and  the chicken was squawking like crazy. (Laughs)  Mom came out and rescued the chicken, for a few minutes anyway. That  was the end of that, but Mom never would kill a chicken. My  grandmother had no problem. She would just take that chicken   s head,  wring it. I seen her do that. Then she got to where she would take a  hatchet (she had a chopping block) and chop their head off. My brother  3 0  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  and I were very inventive of about how to kill chickens. We got a bow  and arrow set and decided that was the way you should do it. My parents  put a quick stop to that, too. (Laughter) I don   t think Mother ever got  over her inability to kill the chicken.  Well, it sounds like you and your brothers were quite inventive. What  else did you do for fun around the farm growing up?  Oh, we had a lot of   we had a horse, and we bought this horse at a sale.  It was a young one. It was during a drought period, and it was skin and  bones. We paid twenty-five dollars for it, and the saddle cost fifty  dollars. We rarely used the saddle unless we were going to ride a long  time because it   s just too much trouble, so we   d ride bareback. When we  got the horse, I was only about nine or ten years old, and my brother   s  only twelve, so we weren   t old enough to break the horse.   There was  a guy that was eighteen years old living half a mile from us,  and so we got him to come down and break the horse. He got the horse  where it wouldn   t buck. I   d never ridden a horse before. I get on the  horse and said,    Giddy up     The horse got scared because I didn   t know  how to   and started running. It ran  for  half a mile until he finally  stopped at a fence. I was hitting mesquite tree limbs. Any rate, that was  my first experience riding a horse. We would ride that on Sundays when  we could go around  to  see friends, and that sort of thing.  One time we had this mule that got in our pasture and had been there for  a year or two. Finally, the owner of the mule came by and said,    Earl, I  know my mule has been in your pasture for a long time, and I should   ve  come and got it. How about me just giving you that mule for the  pasture?    Dad said,    Well, okay,    so we had us a mule. Didn   t know  what to do with it. Didn   t have any use for it. It had snowed, so us boys  decided   we had this old sled that was used as a cultivator by my  granddad. It had the blades on the side of the wooden structure that he  used to pull behind a horse. That   s the way he cultivated back then, and  it was laying out there by the barn.  We took the steel blades off that cut the weeds, and we rigged it up  behind that mule. We   re having fun going out there with that mule  pulling us on that sled until we did something that spooked the mule.  That mule took off, and we went flying one way, and the mule and the  sled went off the other. I never will forget that old mule running with  that sled behind it, scaring him more and more, and the sled hitting the  terraces and bouncing. (Laughs) That was our last adventure with that  mule, I think, and Dad got rid of it.  They washed with these old wringer washing machines with the Maytag  3 1  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  motor, single cylinder. When they finally got the modern ones, you  could get these old Maytag motors for a dollar. They were just sitting  around everywhere. Well, we found this little Cushman frame that used  to be a Cushman motorbike. This is back when the Cushman was the  Moped of the day. It didn   t have a motor, so we got this Maytag motor  and put on this Cushman frame. It didn   t have enough power to get  going, even though we were only about thirteen, fourteen, didn   t weigh  that much, so to get it going we   d get it on  top of  the cellar and get  some momentum. Once she had some momentum going  it would run  and  you could have fun with that.  Then, back in, it was around 1950, we bought two Model As for twenty-five  dollars apiece. Neither one of them were running, so my  older   brother and I, John, made one out of the two, salvaged the parts. I was  only about thirteen, fourteen. I wasn   t near as good mechanically as my  brother. I was the step-and-fetch-it, basically. Oh, we had fun with those  old Model A   s because with a Model A you had what they call a spark  advance. When you started a Model A, you needed to advance that  distributor so that you   d get the good strong spark. Once it was running,  you didn   t need your spark advance.  We found out if you jerked that  spark lever  up and down, you could  make it backfire because it   d fire at the wrong time. (Laughs) You   d  have a big explosion, and it   d go,    Boom     Of course, we didn   t have a  muffler, and it was like a shotgun. We   d go to town and do that at  midnight. (Laughs) I   m sure we were doing terrible damage to that  motor, but we were having so much fun. We used that for a lot of fun. It  finally quit working because the radiator sprung so many leaks it  drowned out the motor. (Laughs)  Would you ever get in trouble for your mischief?  Well, in school, our boys    class had a reputation for being mischievous.  We even had a contest to see who could get the most licks. It was a mark  of pride who was ahead, and this is when we was in the ninth grade. Just  mischievous stuff, aggravating the teachers. They freely used the paddle  back then. You did anything and talked back or anything, out came the  paddle. (Laughs) It was a mark of distinction who had the most, and we  kept track. The principal found out about it, what was happening. He  called us together, and he says,    New rules: no more whippings.       No  more whippings?       Yes, not going to whip you guys anymore.        Really?       Yes. You don   t go out for baseball. Do anything bad, you   re  out of baseball for a week.    Man, we were like little angels from then  on. (Laughter)  That would do it.  3 2  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Yes. (Laughter) I remember one time my brother John and I got into it,  and he ended up hitting me with a two-by-four. He was two years older,  so I was afraid of him, and I was afraid to fight back. I grabbed the two-by-  four and went running to Mama. I got up to the house, and I   m  telling. John   s tagging along behind, going to defend himself. He   s  going to listen to what I   m saying, and he   s going to defend himself,  why he did it. He   s standing there, and I   m telling Mom,       and he took  that two-by-four and hit me...    I saw him there, and I took the two-by-four,        just like this,    and I went WHAM  (Laughter) My mom  decided we were even.  Well, if you got hurt, would you see the doctor? Or sick or...  No, not really. You pretty well doctored there at home. I remember one  time I was making some candy, or trying to, or helping mother. It was  sticky, and I got the spoon and pulled it and splashed it out on my hand.  Burned it pretty bad. Had to go to the doctor for that.  Did you have home remedies or     Yes, they had a lot of castor oil and Black  Draught for all kind of  sickness . When you pull cotton, you pull cotton for others  when  your  cotton crop was pulled. Ours was pulled, so we went over to the  Curnutts    where my grandmother was  raised . My brother and I were  pulling the cotton there, and we finished up about midday. Well, it was a  mile to walk back home, but they had a telephone there. They had party  lines back then. We knew if we used the phone this one lady always  listened, and they were still pulling her cotton. We knew if we called  back home, that lady was going to be listening, and she was liable to get  in on it.  We finally decided we was just too lazy to walk back home and we   d  risk it. We called and said,    Mama, we   re through pulling cotton for the  Curnutts. Would you come and get us?    About that time, (this lady   s  name was Eva) Eva got on the phone.    Verl, they can come over to our  place and pull.    It was only a quarter mile away.    Okay, boys, go over  there.    We go over there, and we   re really upset, having to keep on  pulling cotton. We figured,    Let   s get sick. That way we can go home.     We told them,    Call Mama and Dad to come get us. We   re sick.       Both  of you?       Yes, must   ve been something we ate.     Dad comes and picks us up. Says,    You boys both sick, are you?       Yes,  must   ve been something we ate, Dad.    He could tell we weren   t sick,  and he says,    Well, you know if your stomach   s upset, what you need is  a good dose of castor oil and Black Draught. This   ll fix you up.    Of  3 3  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  course, we wouldn   t tell him,    We   re not really sick,    so he gave us a  big dose of that. (Laughs) Of course, we were really sick then.  That   ll make you sick.  Yes. Used for   it gave you diarrhea.  Nice.  Just like the castor oil, one of those old home remedies to purge your  body. (Laughter) That was the remedy for most things: purge your body.  How did bookkeeping change through the years? Can you recall your  father keeping books or     I   m sure he did, but I haven   t got anything other than the ledger where  he kept some books. That wasn   t extensive. I haven   t got a lot of  records. I know he must have because I know I kept extensive records  for all the financial matters, very extensive records.  Did he trust the banks?  Yes, he trusted them. My mother was a teller in the bank. She was a  teller because her brother-in-law was an officer along with his brother.  They owned the bank in Gould. This is kind of an interesting story. Back  then, the banking was completely different, and they kept all the books  by hand. She   d tell the story about you had to balance the books at the  end of the day, and if you were missing one penny, if it didn   t balance,  you had to stay there an hour or two to find out where that penny was.  Mother died when she was ninety-eight, and when she was ninety-five  she said,    Max, I   m going to tell you a story about what happened in the  bank. I was sworn to secrecy, but you   re the first one. I can tell you.     This was seventy years later, after the incident. She said it was at the end  of the day, the bank doors were shut, and Russell, who was her brother-in-  law, he and his brother Herman who were the co-owners got in an  argument about a loan they had made. They had a disagreement about it  to the point to where they got in a fist fight. They were hitting each other  all over the bank. Finally they got settled, and Russell came over to  Mom and said,    Verl,  remember  what happens in the bank stays in the  bank.    (Laughs) She says,    I kept it a secret for seventy years.    (Laughs)  Did she continue her career in banking, or did she stay home and raise  the family?  Well, it wasn   t a career, per se. No, she was fully occupied on the farm.  3 4  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Yes, I figured with     She was one of the busiest ones, doing all the cooking and everything,  and running to town for this and that, and bringing meals when we were  out in the field. She   d bring meals to us. I remember one time we had  this one quarter section of land that was twelve miles from our home,  and I was plowing, and she brought me lunch. I ate my lunch,  she left   and then I had to go out there and  crank the  old John Deere tractor.  The tractor was one that used to have a starter motor on it, so it had   gear  teeth on the flywheel which you cranked to start it. It was very  rough.  Once the generator  quit , they just yanked them off, and you hand  cranked it. Well, that tractor wouldn   t start, and I remember cranking on  that thing for thirty minutes before I got that thing to start. I was in  excellent shape to even crank that thing because it was hard to crank. I  never will forget how I was so tired and so give out that I was actually  crying. I think I was about fifteen or sixteen. Those ol    John Deere  tractors were something else sometimes to start, and we were young and  didn   t know how to fix things where they would start. You just kept  trying to crank and crank until something happened. (Laughs)  Did your mom, was she involved in any home demonstration clubs?  My grandmother was, but I don   t think they had those sorts of things  that Mom was involved in. I distinctly remember that my grandmother  and her group would get together once a week at the teacherage where  the old Shrewder school was. They had what they called a quilting bee  with a big frame, and they   d all sit around and do their quilting. That  was their social outlet. That was the day they looked forward to. Of  course, they kept up with things with the party line, telephone line. I  remember they would meet in our house once a year and decide what  needed to be done to the party line because they were responsible for the  maintenance. That was their line. No company or anything did the work,  so they   d allocate the work that had to be done to keep it up and  whatever money was needed.  I still remember the telephone number was 1602-F2. You had the crank  telephone, and the length of time you cranked it would be a short crank  or a long crank. A short crank would just be about one turn, and a long  crank would be two or three turns. Ours was two longs. Everybody had  their number of rings, and you knew who was getting the call. It was just  accepted, I guess, that you picked up the line and listened because  everybody did it. (Laughs) Several ladies in particular would always do  it. They would butt in on the conversation just like they were being  3 5  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  called, (Laughs) just like this lady did when we was on this party line  about the cotton.  Did you have any interactions through the years with county agents?  Yes, yes, they were important back then. Everybody used them  extensively for their knowledge. Yes, I remember them. I don   t know if  they called them the county agent at the time, but I used them  extensively when I was farming, for their knowledge, give me advice. A  lot of the land   I say a lot. Some of the land that we had wasn   t as good  for farming crops, and they had the soil conservation program back in  the    50s and    60s. When us boys graduated from high school,  our  dad  was without any assistance on the farm. He didn   t really want to have to  keep up with it anymore. He was getting in his sixties, so he put a lot of  the land in the soil bank, which really worked out great for him because  by doing that it paid for his debt service and he was able to go ahead and  teach.  When we got the farm, some of that land he had put in the soil bank was  better than others, so the land that was the best, we plowed up the grass  and planted the wheat, my brother and I did. This is in    73. As it so  happened, we had great rain that year, and that land had laid fallow for  so long, twenty years or so, it was just fertile as could be. We got fifty  bushel of wheat off some of it, which was very significant back then  when the average was fifteen to twenty. We had about ten thousand  bushels of wheat. We were there, my brother and I. I came down from  Chicago, and he came up from Dallas, and we were doing all the  farming ourselves at the time. We were hiring people to plow it and that  sort of thing.  We came up for the harvest to get the harvest in, and we put it all in the  grain bins and stored it because somebody had told Dad that Russia was  having a bad wheat harvest. It was the grain operator in Enid. He told  dad, he says,    I think wheat   s going to go up in price.    At harvest time,  I   m talking to this local farmer, and I said,    What are you going to do  with your wheat crop?    He said,    You kidding? I   m selling it. It   s two  dollars and fifty cents, and that   s twice as much as it was last year. I   ve  never gotten two dollars and fifty cents for my wheat. I   m selling it.    So  back in my mind, I   m thinking,    Dad said wheat price is going up, and  that guy knows something.    We just stored it.  I go back to Chicago, and my brother goes back to Dallas to fly. I   m  getting the Wall Street Journal, keeping tabs on the futures and  everything. The thing is going up twenty cents a bushel a day. This is in  December. My brother calls from Dallas and says,    Do you realize the  price of wheat is four dollars a bushel?    I said,    Yes.    He says,    You  3 6  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Finchum  Newberry  Finchum  Newberry  ready to sell it?    I said,    Don   t sell any of it. It   s going to keep on going  up.    He says,    Are you sure?    I said,    No, I   m not sure,    (Laughs)    but  that   s what I think.    Sure enough, it got up to five dollars toward the end  of December. I called my brother up, and I said,    We got a tax problem  now if we sell it all, so let   s sell half of it now, and then as soon as  January turns around we   ll sell the other half.    So that   s what we did.  We got fifty thousand dollars from that wheat crop which was more than  half of what the farm cost.  Lots of ups and downs.  Yes, that was the last good year, too. (Laughs) Like the local farmer  down there says,    Max, you better enjoy it because you   ll probably  never see another one.    He was right.  Well, the    80s were rough, too.  Oh, gee, were they, not only the interest rates but everything, yes, tough.  That   s farming. Poor guys down there in southwest  Oklahoma , I sold  the farm in 2007. I wasn   t looking to sell it, but this local real estate guy  who lived in Russell but ran his office out of Altus calls me up and said,     Max, I think I can get a buyer for your land.    I said,    I   m not ready to  sell it, not interested in selling it.    He says,    Well, if I could get the right  price, would you sell it?    I said,    Sure.    He says,    You don   t mind me  looking for somebody to buy it, do you?    I said,    No, you   re welcome to  try.    He comes back, and he says,    I think I got somebody that I can sell  it to. I think I can get maybe  400 an acre. How does that sound?     I couldn   t believe it because I wasn   t expecting more than  300,  325  for that land down there because it was mostly pastureland. Any rate,  land prices weren   t that great, so I said,    Let me think about that.    I got  to looking into it, and I found out that land was actually selling for  around  450 to  500 an acre. I told him,    I educated myself a little bit on  the price of land, and I think that   s too low.    He said,    Oh, you looked it  up, did you?    I said,    Yes.    He says,    I   ll see what else I can do.    About  a year or so goes by, and I said,    I don   t really have to sell it and don   t  necessarily want to sell it, but if you can get the right price   .    To make  a longer story shorter, I ended up getting  700 for some of it. I sold it all  at one time. I had to sell the minerals with some of that. I kept half the  minerals, but I sold half the minerals to the other guy.  Did you go down and visit it before you signed off?  Oh, I still go. I still go. I go down to alumni every year, and I go back  and see if he   s taking proper care of it. After I grubbed the mesquite  out   when I first started grubbing that mesquite out, Dad said,    Now,  3 7  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Max, I don   t want to discourage you on mesquite grubbing, but those  mesquite seeds, they   ll stay viable for ten years in the soil.    I didn   t tell  him this, but I thought,    You   re exaggerating, Dad. No seed will stay in  the ground ten years and sprout.     I found out that they   ll stay in the ground for over twenty years. I know  that because I grubbed out the trees in this lot which was fenced off. No  cattle were getting in it, and twenty years later there   s still sprouts  coming up from the seed. After I grubbed the big ones, I went out, and I  got an ATV with a pressure sprayer operated off the battery, and I   d spot  spray all of those little sprouts. They   re still sprouting down there, still  sprouting. The guy that bought it from me, he   s let it go for four or five  years, but he   s out there spraying again now.  Do you miss it?  Oh, yes, I miss going down there. It was a lot of fun camping out. My  son  Gary  would go down there with me, and we   d go out together and  spray the mesquite seedlings and have a good time in the evening  together, take our dog down there. My son called it the dog   s  Disneyland. (Laughs) First thing those dogs would do when they   d get  down there is find some manure and wallow in it. Until I knew better, I  thought,    Crazy dog  He   s crazy.    Of course, he   s killing his scent.  Funny how animals are smart like that. That dog would charge the cattle.  He   d have so much fun running the cattle. They hadn   t seen a dog run at  them, and it   d scare them. The cattle wised up after a little bit, and they  came back and ran at him until the dog took off running. (Laughs)  Well, as we wind down, is there any last memory you   d like to share  about your land you   ve owned for so long and grew up on and have such  a strong family connection on?  The rural life is a good one, from the standpoint of learning about life  and living life and understanding what makes things work. I enjoyed it. I  wouldn   t trade it for anything, the growing up experience, but at the  time, man, it was tough. It was hard work. It was always work, but you  know as a young kid, it doesn't bother you that much, but as I grew older  I said,    I don   t think I want to do this for the rest of my life.    Anymore,  it   s not labor intensive like it used to be. When I grew up, everything  was labor intensive. Today, gee, air conditioning and music and  everything in your cab. You touch a switch, and everything happens.  Used to, everything was grunt work.  It   s just so much different now than when it was with the soil  conservation, without plowing and leaving the land there with all the  debris on it. It   s completely different in that regard and certainly a lot  3 8  Finchum  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  Newberry  Nykolaiszyn  better. It   s a lot more cost efficient and a lot better for your land. It   s just  amazing, the transformation. It   s just hard to imagine what   s going to  happen in the future. As things get more expensive, farms have got to  get bigger. It   s amazing what has happened with prices these days. Just  the other day, I   m looking, and calves 300 or 400 pounds are selling for   2.50 a pound. When I was doing it, typically they were, like, 70 or 80  cents. There   s a big risk when you pay for a calf at 300 or 400 pounds  and you   re  paying  up to  800 or  900  a head , and you   re buying  several hundred head  of  stockers.  Every year, we would buy our cattle and keep them for a year. We   d buy  them at about 300 or 400 pounds and put them on wheat pasture, then  sell them the next fall at 700 pounds or so. If you lost cattle, it was really  hurtful. In today   s time, that   s really got to be bad. I don   t envy those  guys down there, lack of rain and all that cost. Of course, they   re selling  them for a lot more, too. Maybe it evens out okay. Being a farmer, you  don   t have to go to Vegas to gamble, I   ll tell you that. You   re a bigger  gambler than anybody in Vegas. (Laughs)  That   s true.  I   d go every year to the banker, and this is back when cattle were cheap.  I   d go,    I need another  80,000 to buy cattle.    That was just something  you did and hoped things worked out to where you could pay them back  and make some profit. It   s a rewarding life, but I think you  have  to  grow up  on the farm . I don   t know what   s going to happen. You got to  grow up on a farm to farm, in my judgment. I don   t know how anybody  would go into farming that hadn   t been part of the farm. I just don   t  understand how you could possibly do it. You got people like me who  are investing in land and yet wanting to be a part of the farming kind of  community, which is why I did it.  I wanted to keep on experiencing that life, and also I regard it as a good  investment, which for many years it didn   t look like it was going to be a  good investment because the prices dropped down to half of what I paid  for some of the land there for a while, while the interest rate went way  up. It looked like the worst kind of decision that was ever made, but  fortunately I was able to hang on and sell it at a good price, and it   s  providing a good retirement.  We appreciate you sharing memories of your time growing up and your  family and learning more about your land.  Well, obviously I enjoyed it, too. (Laughs)  Thank you so much.  3 9  Newberry  Thank y   all.  -------  -------
