Story_ID: 322809
Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask as a kind of a warm up.  The first one is, ma'am do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes, (laughter) potatoes. Any kind, I've never tasted a potato I didn't like (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorites color?
Speaker 2: Yes, turquoise.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I think summer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I like it hot.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I haven't been a lot of places, I love Disney World [Walt Disney World Resort, Orlando, Florida] though, I love the sci-fi part of Disney World and Universal Studios [Universal Studios Hollywood, Los Angeles, California] about science fiction movies, so--actually my family did a little bitty 'Star Trek' video (laughter) a long time ago, about seventeen years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay, what they actually made the video themselves, I mean--?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was a little movie, a mini-movie, a ten-minute movie.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, was it something that your children thought of or did you think of?
Speaker 2: Well my family is big into science fiction and 'Star Trek' is something that my kids have grown up with so they like it, and I'm a 'Star Trek' fanatic.  I have a 'Star Trek' room and my ex-husband started out with 'Star Trek' so we all like it.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right and the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I say when--if people call my house and they get my message, it always says live long and prosper and I write that on, yes! (Laughter)  And I do write that on cards and things like that.  I'll tell people that, so I guess that would be it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In gymnastics I tell the kids, when I give them my attention I say, "I don't want you to feel neglected and unloved," so you know they know I'm coming over to give you my attention to help you get down in your split or whatever, but I think live long and prosper probably is (laughter).
Story_ID: 322810
Speaker 1: Now, I'm going to ask you about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Richard Stephenson, Jr.] side.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Ruby Jean Jordan [Ruby Jordan Stephenson], that's her maiden name and its R-U-B-Y, J-E-A-N, J-O-R-D-A-N.  She was born in Nashville, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: When was she born?
Speaker 2: On June 23, 1929.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side, how far back can you go in terms of tracing those ancestors?
Speaker 2: Well my mom is like the family historian and so she's gone to the National Archives [National Archives and Records Administration] a lot of times and she has actually a book that she has done, it must be about two hundred pages of information about our family history, actually on both sides, and she's even gotten photographs--with--very, very far.  So I know on her side of the family I think the farthest back I can remember is in the 1700s we have a relative Celia Turman [ph.], I think was her last name, who escaped from slavery by swimming across the Mississippi River, and she went into Indian [Native American] territory, married and lived in Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: That's quite a story.  Now where did she escape from?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.  I wish I'd have known I would have brought the notebook, because my mom has done a lot of research on it, but I don't know where she came from.  I just know that she ended up in Oklahoma, and so we have a branch of family in Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's quite a story, so maybe you can, you know if there's a copy of that history.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: You know, you can you know, send it to us we can put in this archive box we keep you know with information you, you know in the library.  I'll have to show you that during the break.
Speaker 2: Oh okay, okay.
Speaker 1: But, any other stories?  Now Celia is that--now, now so you have part of your family in Oklahoma, it's based in Oklahoma (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yes, and then one of my--my mother's grandmother was the slave of President Polk, James K. Polk [President James Knox Polk].
Speaker 1: Okay, this is like in 1850s [sic. 1840s]?
Speaker 2: Somewhere in there.
Speaker 1: Cause he was--I believe, yeah, James--no, that was in the 1870s I guess, cause he was like the president during the--.
Speaker 2: I cannot remember.
Speaker 1: I know--.
Speaker 2: I ought to because I'm a history major (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I think when--yeah.
Speaker 2: But, I don't remember my chronological order of the presidents, and their years but I know that her grandmother was his slave and she talked about him to some extent, not a lot, but actually we had--we thought he might be her father, but I don't think that's the case, I don't think that's true.  She was just owned by his family.
Speaker 1: Now this is where?
Speaker 2: I think it was in Tennessee.
Speaker 1: I think, I'm trying to think, I'm thinking he was president around 1850 [sic. 1845-1849] or so, Polk, yeah.
Speaker 2: That sounds about right.
Speaker 1: By the time of the Fugitive Slave Act [Fugitive Slave Act of 1850] I think, I think.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm stretching myself--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: It's really more (unclear) I'm rusty, but I think that's the one, yeah, yeah, so and where were they you say?
Speaker 2: I think they were in Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Tennessee?  Okay.  Did she have any stories about James Knox Polk?
Speaker 2: Not really, not that I can recall.  I just remember you know, actually we--as I said we thought he was her father for a long time but my mom said they don't that that was the case, and that he, I don't know if he even had any children.  So you know, I don't have any stories about her life with the Polk family; or anything like that, on the plantation or whatever, just that she was his grand- her--my mother's grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I've seen pictures of her and she and my grandmother and my mother look very much alike to me.
Speaker 1: Now, what is her name?
Speaker 2: Matilda, Matilda Polk.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is your mother's?
Speaker 2: Grandmother.
Speaker 1: Grandmother, okay, so that's your great-grandmother, okay.
Speaker 2: Or was it my mother's great--it might, yeah, I think it was my mother's grandmother.
Story_ID: 322811
Speaker 1: Any other stories from that side of the family?
Speaker 2: Not really, I mean a lot of small stories.  My [maternal] grandmother lived in a house where her husband added on a lot of additions, and I remember that was in Nashville [Tennessee], right around the corner from Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee], and I remember we use to go every spring break to visit her and she use to have roomers in her house.  She rented rooms out to help pay the rent and everything.  My [maternal] grandfather died when I was little, so she was the head of the house and all of her children were grown but she stayed in that house for many, many years after that and I remember her talking about students that lived in the house.  My brother, when he went to Fisk for a while lived there with her and so just little stories like that, yeah that's about it.
Speaker 1: Did you have members from that side of the family who were into the construction trades; because I know Nashville had a lot of construction going on in those days.
Speaker 2: You know I don't know what my grandfather did, but in know he did--I believe he is the one that added onto the house.  By the time I was old enough to notice the house was really interesting because it had so many nooks and crannies and different entrances, but I believe he did it.  I don't know if he was in construction.  I don't ever remember hearing anything about him being in construction, but as I said he died.  I think I must've been about three or four years old when he died.
Speaker 1: Okay, what did he do for a living or what (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I really don't know.  I think my grandmother was a nurse, and my grandfather I don't know what he did.
Speaker 1: Were they associated with the school?
Speaker 2: My family was always--
Speaker 1: I mean Fisk University.
Speaker 2: They were always affiliated with Fisk.  I don't know if my mother's [Ruby Jordan Stephenson] mother was directly affiliated, but I know that I had aunts and uncles on both sides of the family who either were deans at Fisk or taught at Fisk or you know, were in some kind of capacity working at Fisk, so and then my parents both went to Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State College; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee].  Well my father [Richard Stephenson, Jr.] went to Fisk for a while then he went to Tennessee State also, and so there were people in the family who were related to, you know involved with Tennessee State as well.  It's funny, I think, I probably know less about the people, there's so many of them that I can't even keep them straight.  My brother can keep them straight, I can't, but just a lot of people involved in education and you know with the universities and with the schools so.
Speaker 1: Okay well that's--so is your mother raised around a lot of, well she's raised in like a college, I mean an education-rich environment it sounds you know.
Speaker 2: And education was always important but at their time, the people in those times, black people in those times education was the way, and we've kind of lost that with the majority of the community it seems like, but the emphasis back then was education is the way that you improve yourself and your family and the community, so I think their values were different than they are now to some extent, because everybody was expected to go on, you know the schools were segregated but people were told about black history so they had a sense of pride and a sense of knowledge about themselves, and I think that made a big difference for them and for us, and then it kind of fell off I think with our generation.
Speaker 1: Now did you know your grandparents?
Speaker 2: I did, I knew my grandmother on my mother's side, on my father's side I knew my step-grandfather [George Thomas (ph.)] cause my grandmother was divorced so I never met my--I think actually he [Allen's paternal grandfather, Richard Stephenson, Sr.] might have died when I was very, very young when I was a baby, so--.
Speaker 1: But on your mother's side did you know--so you knew your grandmother on your mother's side, okay.
Speaker 2: I knew my grandmother.  My grandfather died when I was young so I didn't really know him.  I remember seeing him, I don't remember ever, I don't remember interacting with him 'cause I was pretty young.  My grandmother I knew very well and she was very, she was quiet but she was always very sweet, very nice lady.
Speaker 1: She had the big house then right okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She had the big house yes.
Speaker 1: With (unclear) rooms, all right.
Speaker 2: And we'd go exploring all the nooks and crannies in the house, and she had a garden outside and they use to tell us stories about one-armed Annie, and people you know, people who were probably mentally ill that people were afraid of, the kids were afraid of them, 'cause people didn't know and we saw this lady walking down the street who you know was kind of out of it talking to herself that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Who was one-armed Annie?
Speaker 2: She was just a lady who walked through the streets in the neighborhood around my grandmother's house in Nashville and she was--looking back on it she was probably mentally ill, but people use to say--you know with people who are a little bit different, they spread rumors about them, and so we were always afraid of her or looking out for her, you know that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 322812
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Ruby Jordan Stephenson] have any stories of growing up that she's shared with you?
Speaker 2: She told me she met my dad [Richard Stephenson, Jr.] when they were both in elementary school and I think my father was in a Catholic school, my mom was in a public school.  She tells me stories about growing up in her family.  She had a big family.  She has two sisters; well I'm trying to think how big it is--three sisters and two brothers.
Speaker 1: Now, did she grow up in Nashville [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: She grew up in Nashville yes.
Speaker 1: She grew up in Nashville, okay and--.
Speaker 2: Around the corner from Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], so there were six kids which nowadays is a huge family, and she tells me stories about you know growing up.  She was the, I'm trying to think, her brothers are older, I think she was the second daughter and so she had two sisters younger, so there were four girls and two boys and she tells me stories about the dynamics of the family, you know growing up.  One sister is very insecure, she--my mom says you know she was a really, really great mother, my mom--and--is a great mom and her insights are just tremendous and she looks back on how she grew up and she can understand why her sister is the way she is or why you know different people are the way they are, and as I was growing up I just wanted to be like she is, because she just is very understanding, very insightful, she is very encouraging and she was somebody that I could always talk to, and I don't know what she was like com- growing up, but I get a sense that she was like that.  She's looked at as the leader of the family.  She pulls people together on all sides of the family.  My father's family, she's gone to the archives all the time.  She's gotten history on both sides of the family and she's put it together in books, and then she always pulls people together at family reunions and gives them all this history, and she interviews people constantly.  She goes--people send her photographs from all over the country because they know she'll put it together in a book, and then she ties all the family together.  So you know as I listen to her, she really is the family historian.  She doesn't talk that much about her own life as she was growing up, but she goes back in history and tells us little snippets about you know, Charlie Smith [ph.] who was an Indian [Native American] who lived on a reservation and he married an African American woman and she has a picture of him, and I can't remember he must have been young just as slavery was ending, and she has a picture of him, I will never forget it, sitting in a rocking chair at the homestead they call it.  I don't even know where the homestead is, but she has pictures of him and she has pictures of other relatives that are standing--you can see the old-style clothing that they wore, the boots that the women wore and how they wore their hair and as a history, former history teacher, I, you know, identify with that, you know, oh, that must have been the time of Madam C.J. Walker, or this might have been about the time of Mary McLeod Bethune you know, and it just puts it into perspective and it just puts it in perspective and it's just you know really fantastic to have somebody in the family who does that.
Speaker 1: So, the Oklahoma connection now, those are your mother's relatives on her father's side or her mother's side or which?
Speaker 2: Now that I don't know because I get them mixed up.  She has so much and she's done so much on both side of her family and both sides of my father's family that I even get them mixed up; which is my mother's side and which is my father's side.  So I really don't know.  I can find out though.
Speaker 1: Okay, I just asked.  Well, so you mother went to Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State College; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Yes, she was a business major and she got her degree, a bachelor's degree in think in business administration.
Story_ID: 322813
Speaker 1: Now, your parents [Ruby Jordan Stephenson and Richard Stephenson, Jr.] met in grade school you said?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right, so they knew each other.
Speaker 2: And then they went to Pearl High School [Pearl-Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School] in Nashville [Tennessee] and they went to Pearl together and then they went to Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State College; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee] together.  I think they started going together in high school, and so they went together all through high school and through college and got married after college and then we moved to Little Rock, Arkansas cause my father was in the Reserves, in the--I wanna say which branch?  Not the [U.S.] Army, I don't remember, I should know that, but so they--he was stationed in Fort Chaffee [Arkansas].
Speaker 1: [U.S.] Air Force or was it--?
Speaker 2: It wasn't Air Force--.
Speaker 1: The Army?
Speaker 2: It must have been the Army.
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: And so we lived there for a little bit.  I was born in Nashville then they went to Fort Chaffee, and then my brother [Richard Stephenson III] was born a year and a half after I was and then we moved, I must've been maybe four, three, three or four--to Chicago [Illinois].  My father, I think his degree was in science, but he was having trouble getting a job and we had relatives that had moved to Chicago already so you know, like the black migration from the South to the North he came north to try to find a better job.
Story_ID: 322814
Speaker 1: Now can you give us your father's full name and spell it?
Speaker 2: Richard Earl Stephenson [Richard Stephenson, Jr.], and Stephenson is S-T-E-P-H-E-N-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born June 4, 1929.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he's a--.
Speaker 2: And I believe in Nashville, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: So he's a couple of weeks younger than your mother [Ruby Jordan Stephenson]?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: I see, okay in Nashville and what do you know about his side of the family in terms of the ancestors on that side?
Speaker 2: Well, my grandmother, I knew grew up knowing her.  She had been married to Richard Earl Stephenson [Richard Stephenson, Sr.], I guess the first, and they were divorced; when, well when my father was little and she remarried George Thomas [ph.] who was very, very good.  He married her even though she had two children already, and between they had two more and he raised them all as his own, and he raised us as his grandchildren.  He's the only grandfather that I really ever knew and they lived in Tennessee, I wanna say it must have been Murfreesboro [Tennessee] for a while and then they lived in Nashville, that's where my father met my mother, and then they moved to Chicago [Illinois], but I don't know the timeframe.  I know they were here in Chicago before my family--my immediate family came and for a while we lived with my grandmother and grandfather, so my grandmother I don't really know what she did in terms of an occupation, or I really don't--well my grandfather was a carpenter and I know I have bookshelves that he built and some other things that he built.  I believe he taught in one of the vocational schools in Chicago.
Story_ID: 322815
Speaker 1: And my father [Richard Stephenson, Jr.] taught at, well he started out working as a lab assistant in the science lab I think at University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], but I'm not absolutely sure.  I ought to know that.  I use to know it but then he went into education, he and my mother [Ruby Jordan Stephenson] both and my mother ended up teaching at Sexton Elementary School [Austin O. Sexton Elementary School] in Chicago [Illinois], my father went through the ranks (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A.O. Sexton, right.
Speaker 1: Yes, went through the ranks and ended up being principal or assistant principal at Forestville Upper Grade Center [Chicago, Illinois], and ended up being the principal at Dunbar Vocational High School [Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] for many, many years and was the interim superintendent for Chicago for a very brief period of time.
Speaker 2: Now, are there any stories about your father that he's told about growing up that really stick out in your mind?
Speaker 1: He and my mother tell different tales of when they were young.  He tells the--his version is the athlete; the varsity athlete who you know was a superstar in a lot of different sports.  My mom tells a different story and I don't--I think the truth is somewhere in between, but I know my father is a trickster, and he use to tell us stories about things he did to get even with people who did things to him, and especially in the Reserves.  He was--he went through ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] and he was an officer, and in those days I know it was hard because he was a black officer and he'd have whites who were under him and he had people who just didn't cooperate with him, or challenged him, his competency, and I--some of the tales he tells I don't know if they were whites or black that did this, but I know that he got even with them with many, many tricks.  Even in the lab he tells about putting a lab mouse in somebody's briefcase and he has this horrible laugh that if you hear him laugh, you know he has done something awful to somebody, and so I remember him telling tales of leading men on a march, and they were supposed to not drink any water and people kept sneaking water so he put salt in the water supply and he tells about how they--they just were horrified when they tried to drink this water, and it was salt water and he just thought it was so funny.  So he was a trickster and he still is, 'cause I have to watch him very carefully cause he'll play a trick on you.  I remember, so in terms of his childhood, I know they didn't have a lot and my grandfather [George Thomas (ph.)] came along and he really stabilized the family.  I believe Richard Earl Stephenson [Richard Stephenson, Sr.] I had problems.  I think he had--he might have been an alcoholic, I don't remember, but I know my dad never drank.  I don't drink, and I think it had something to do with the fear of that kind of thing, you know the alcoholism, but I didn't know him at all.  My step-grandfather is the one I know and he stabilized the family.  They had two more children after he married my grandmother who had two already, and he was a wonderful person, he was a very wonderful person. We use to call him Grand-poppy, and so I have my kids call my father Grand-poppy, so now my mother was raised--she had six, there were six siblings or six children in the family, and so she tells me stories about how they didn't get along, or how they did get along or how, you know, usual family dynamics.  One of the things I remember them telling me about is at Pearl High School [Pearl-Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School, Nashville, Tennessee], how they always learned black history and they had a great sense of pride because the teachers taught them about you know, black people who had come before who had paved the way for us through you know whatever historical perspective they were talking about, so I remember that and that they--they always had a sense of who they were, all the way through school, through college and I think that paid off in terms of how they've been successful here in Chicago.
Speaker 2: So you think they came out of a pretty strong community in Nashville [Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Definitely, definitely, and I mean that's the way it was back in those days, and it's unfortunate that things have changed a lot for kids nowadays.  I grew up in that kind of situation, the neighborhood, people always watched out for everyone.
Story_ID: 322816
Speaker 1: One of the questions we always ask is do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I remember, I remember when we first moved into the home that I was raised in.  It was a relatively new neighborhood.  The neighborhoods around were starting to change in Chicago [Illinois], whites were running, so the neighborhoods were turning over pretty fast, but where we lived was a newer area, and I think it was built part of the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] or you know whatever after World War II [WWII].
Speaker 1: Now what's the name of the area the area that you--?
Speaker 2: Chatham--in Chatham, at 87th [Street], I grew up at 88th [Street] and Calumet [Avenue] which is just between King Drive [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive] and State Street and it was, the new--the houses were new and I remember, I don't remember the house being new, but I remember dirt, a dirt hill, cause we use to roll down that hill, and I remember, my mother had photographs of us, my brothers and I, well my brother [Richard Stephenson III] and I and cousins and we were all covered with dirt and she took a picture of us standing against the wall, cause I remember that there was no grass you know, they were just building the neighborhood and I think maybe they had built some of the houses two years earlier, so it was a pretty new community, and--
Speaker 1: So this was about 1954, '55 [1955]?
Speaker 2: Right in there, um-hm, and I remember we had lived with my [paternal] grandmother, so I guess going beyond that.
Story_ID: 322817
Speaker 1: We lived with my [paternal] grandmother on 62nd [Street] and Bishop [Street], and I went to Copernicus Elementary School [Nicholas Copernicus Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].  I don't--I remember that there were white kids that lived in the neighborhood, and I just remember them throwing tomatoes at us and then they were gone and they had moved, and I went to Copernicus for kindergarten and then we moved to Chatham [Chicago, Illinois] and I went to Burnside [Burnside Elementary School; Burnside Scholastic Academy, Chicago, Illinois], and I remember that were white students at Burnside for a while, maybe for a couple of years, one or two years, and then the neighborhood changed over by Tuley Park [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 1: We always played, the neighborhood had a lot of children and I remember roller skating up and down the street, skate boards weren't in, no what do you call those, no rollerblades, it was just roller skates that you screw onto your shoes and we use to do that all the time and riding bikes and playing kickball in the street and people always watched out for everybody else.  When the street lights came on, everybody was supposed to be in the house.  So as soon as the street lights came on the streets cleared.  All the kids came running home, just--we had a lot of fun playing.  I do remember though that my brother [Richard Stephenson III] and I were bullied quite a bit, and we use to get beat up every day going to school by some older kids, and it was so bad I remember my mother [Ruby Jordan Stephenson] going over to talk to the other mom, and I don't remember the result of the conversation but I don't remember it stopping particularly.  I became a bully for a little while, I remember that and one day I said to myself, "Why am I doing this," and then I stopped, and so it was some kind of consciousness, you know I guess when kids get picked on many times they can become the bullies.
Story_ID: 322818
Speaker 1: So you were talking about being a bully and were you a big, I don't you're very, you don't seem to be very big and you been sitting down since I--okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I wasn't, but for some reason these two kids beat my brother [Richard Stephenson III] and I up every day and they especially picked on him and I remember--what I remember of the girl, the boy was my grade, this was when I was in first grade and my brother was in kindergarten or maybe I must have been in second grade and my brother was in kindergarten and the girl, I think was in fifth or sixth grade and she use to beat us up all the way home and I you know--and the kids in the neighborhood [Chatham, Chicago, Illinois] we got along fairly well but for reason my brother got picked on a lot when he was little, and I just remember becoming a bully just to one kid or a couple of kids and I don't know why I did that, but I remember when I became of aware of what I was doing and that it was wrong and I remember apologizing to this little girl and it was just interesting, but the school itself academically, I don't remember it being that great.  I remember the first day of school.  They were playing a game when I came in; I came into the school late, into the classroom late--.
Speaker 1: This was Burnside Elementary [Burnside Elementary School; Burnside Scholastic Academy, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Burnside Elementary, and they were playing a game where they go through the aisles and I just remember that nobody picked me and over and over and over they played this game and I never was engaged--
Speaker 1: Is that the one where you put your head down and dance and somebody taps you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think it was Thumbs- or Seven Up--
Speaker 1: Seven Up [Heads Up, Seven Up], that sounds like, yeah the game.
Speaker 2: Or something where they--you hold your thumb up and they push it down and then they run back and sit down and then you have to figure out who pushed your thumb down or something. I can't even remember how you play it, but I remember getting in trouble on the first day of school, and I wasn't a bad kid, but I remember getting in trouble on the first day of school because I sat there and sat there and nobody picked me, and then I remember somebody walking through the aisle and I stuck my foot out and tripped the person, and so then that was established me as--well I wasn't established as a troublemaker, I just got in trouble that first day, but I--most of the time I remember a period of time when I bullied, when I was a bully but then most of the time I was just a nice quiet kid, but academically I don't think the school was very strong.  It might have been at some time but I remember--I don't remember a lot, I remember my mom [Ruby Jordan Stephenson] telling me that my first grade teacher thought I was retarded or something, and she was outraged about that.  I don't remember second and third grade except I remember some bullying going on.  I remember in fourth grade getting a teacher who was African American and I was looking so forward to having her.  We had her for maybe a month or two and then she went on sick leave, and we got another teacher in who was horrible and I remember that it was horrible, that she could not control the class, the kids were always walking out, playing around, and I remember that I could not concentrate, and so it was a bad year.
Story_ID: 322819
Speaker 1: Then, that was fourth grade, they built McDade Elementary School [James E. McDade Elementary School; James E. McDade Classical School, Chicago, Illinois] across the alley from our house, and so we all transferred to McDade.  So I went to McDade for fifth and sixth grade, it was a K [kindergarten]-6.  So I went to McDade for fifth and sixth grade which was a great experience and that was the first time that I remember loving school, and I remember Mrs. Ramey.  She was a teacher, who was just fantastic, and with Mrs. Ramey, because of her I became socially aware and wanted to become a history teacher and I remember in her class I wrote a letter to President Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy].  I was in fifth grade, I wrote a letter to President Kennedy protesting the treatment of Native American Indians, and I got a packet back from the Bureau of Indian Affairs and it's a letter saying your, your understanding of American history is erroneous.  And I thought that meant stupid, and I cried.  I hid the packet from my mother [Ruby Jordan Stephenson] because I thought I was in trouble with the government, and I don't think I told her about that for years until many, many years later.
Speaker 2: So you thought you were in trouble with the government for--.
Speaker 1: Yes, because, they sent me a packet, I don't they realized I was just a kid cause I had very, very good handwriting, and I think they thought I was an adult and so they sent this big packet back from the Bureau of Indian Affairs.  It must have been this thick, and I looked it over and I still felt I was right and--
Speaker 2: What specific thing did you ask them about that they said that you erroneous for?
Speaker 1: I don't--I think, well I don't remember what it was, but it had to be something that Mrs. Ramey had talked about in class.  It had to be something that she taught and or talked about and it had to do with, I'm sure putting the Indians on reservations.  I'm almost positive that's what it was, cause as I think back I know that that upset me that they were being put, they had been put on reservations and that they lost their land, and that kind of thing and that's what I was writing about, and as I think about it I still think I was right, you know, they did do that.  Of course, you know so much of American history is interpretation and the victors write the stories so.
Speaker 2: So the Bureau of Indian Affairs is trying to show you how it works (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right, right and they were wrong.
Speaker 2: That they were trying to do come (unclear).
Speaker 1: Right, right. Propaganda (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I guess they were trying to show that they were trying to do something (unclear).
Speaker 1: Right, so but she made me socially aware, I remember that and I remember that I wanted to be a teacher because of her.
Speaker 2: What's her name again?
Speaker 1: Mrs. Ramey, she died some years ago.  I didn't know when she died.  I think it's R-A-M-E-Y, and I wanna say Marlene [ph.], but I'm not sure if that was her first name.  When I coached gymnastics later, many years later, her daughters were in my program, or her--maybe her granddaughters, I'm not sure, but I had a little bit of contact with her then, but then I moved out to Oak Park [Illinois] and my gym moved out to Oak Park and I didn't have much contact with her.  When she died I didn't know until a couple of years later, and I was very sad.
Speaker 2: How do you spell her name?
Speaker 1: I think it's R-A-M-E-Y.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So she, she's the first teacher who really, really inspired me and then the next year in sixth grade I had Mr. Bonique [ph.] and I don't know how you spell his name, but I know he was just another awesome history teacher who just increased my social awareness, and the two of them were just fantastic.  So I had three years because in my seventh grade I had Mr. Lewis [ph.] who was just fantastic also.  So those three years of elementary education were just fantastic and inspired me to become a teacher, and from then, from fifth grade on I always wanted to be a history teacher.
Story_ID: 322820
Speaker 1: Now that was an interesting time for history I guess studies--we're about the same age, when I was in school and I remember that the Civil War Centennial was discussed a lot you know because it's a hundred years after the Civil War, so from 1960 on you had like Civil War programs on television, people were talking about the Civil War a lot, a hundred years ago this happened or that happened, and then you had the Civil Rights Movement unfolding in front of your face.
Speaker 2: Well that's what I remember more than the Civil War aspects of it.  I remember Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] came to our neighborhood [Chatham, Chicago, Illinois] 'cause we had a Baptist minister.  She was my friend Charlotte Thurston, who has died, but her dad [John Thurston] was a Baptist minister and Martin Luther King came to his church, and so he would come into the neighborhood sometimes.  I remember--.
Speaker 1: That's at New Covenant [New Covenant Missionary Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois] right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: New Covenant Church.
Speaker 2: His son is now the pastor there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Stephen Thurston [Stephen J. Thurston], yeah.
Speaker 2: So I remember that and I remember in '65 [1965] seeing some of the marches and things that were happening in the South with the, you know the hoses and all that kind of stuff.  I can't put it in perspective, I just remember in '65 [1965] seeing some things happen and I remember when, well when I was in seventh grade, President Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was assassinated and I remember that.  I remember coming home for lunch and my great-grandmother who was babysit--babysat for my two younger--well my younger brother, both of them, my two youngest brothers [George Stephenson and Harold Stephenson].  It was on television and we walked back to school, cause in those days kids walked home from school for lunch and we walked back and I remember Mr. Lewis [ph.] coming into the seventh grade classroom and telling us that President Kennedy had been killed and crying, and a lot of people were crying and they sent us all home and then we watched it on television, you know as all the, as everything was unfolding.
Speaker 1: Now why was, why was it that President Kennedy meant so much to you and to Mr. Lewis and others?
Speaker 2: I remember the first time I ever heard about President Kennedy.  Some kids, we were at some kind of gathering at my [paternal] grandmother's house and there were some kids in the neighborhood, some teenage girls, well it must have been my aunt who is seven years older than I am.  Her friends, I was allowed to hang around with them for this one time only, and I remember them talking about calling President Kennedy on the phone 'cause he was cute, he was young and he was cute and you know he had an image.  Looking back on it we talk about Camelot and all of that.  I didn't know about any of that, just that the kids all thought he was cute and he was young and he was exciting.  So they had you know their little phone conversations with President Kennedy.
Speaker 1: Phone--what do you mean?
Speaker 2: Looking--telephone, they would pretend they were calling him on the phone.
Speaker 1: They would pretend they were calling, okay all right.
Speaker 2: And so that's the first time I ever heard of him but I think for people who were adults at that time he represented a change; he was young, he was vivacious, he had an image of being different in terms of black people, more open to treating people fairly.  He was an inspirational person, I remember hearing his speeches about the Peace Corps, and you know, "Ask not when you can do for your country--ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country."  I remember that quote and so he just had that image that things were gonna change for black folks.
Story_ID: 322821
Speaker 1: And I just remember you know things happening in the South that I had never seen, and actually when I talk to some of the students, I don't always--my recollection is not historically accurate all the time, but I remember watching the marches in Selma [Alabama] when they turned those fire hoses on.  I remember seeing it in black and white on television and not understanding what in the world is going on, and--
Speaker 2: That sounds like Birmingham [Alabama] '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: Yes, and wanting to go down there and my mother [Ruby Jordan Stephenson] thought I was crazy to want to go down there but we my teachers had instilled in us you know a sense of justice, that there must be justice and you have to work for justice and I just will never forget that.  I told students about that, how you know looking at television it was the first time, and most of America didn't want to see that, seeing kids walking down the street.  I didn't realize they were kids until I was grown, but I mean they were teenagers, I knew they were teenagers, but for me the teenager is a grown person, you know a much older person and I remember--I told my students about how I watched on television and saw this cloud of dust coming, and here come the policemen on horses and they start whacking heads and whacking heads and then I said I saw the police dogs, the policemen coming, running with these German Shepherd dogs and they let them go, and I told them about how I saw them grab a person's arm and just shake this person like a rag doll, and then seeing the fire trucks come and they turn their hoses on people and you know knock people down and blew them across the street and knocked them into walls, and the students, this was not my students technically, but in my position I can do presentations to classrooms, and one of the middle schools asked me to do a presentation on the Civil Rights Movement, and I just really talked to them like it was a conversation--about a hundred kids and I just talked to them about what I saw and most of them had never heard of that before, and I brought a film that I left with their teachers about the Children's March [Children's Crusade] so that they could show it as part of the you know black studies portion of American history, but I remember that, and I remember President Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] being killed and I remember, well you know that whole time period from '63 [1963] to probably '69 [1969].  That was you know, I was coming up and it was--we were becoming more aware.  I started high school in '65 [1965] and you know we were marching out of school for black studies, and we wanted a black studies curriculum and that kind of stuff.  I remember when Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated; I was a junior in high school [John Marshall Harlan High School; Harlan Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 322822
Speaker 1: Now I don't want to take you back that far yet, but let me go back.  I wanted to ask you about what--describe, I was asking you to describe your neighborhood a while ago, but I think it's important to describe Chatham, 'cause Chatham is a different--from a different Chicago [Illinois] neighborhood, different in terms of its attitude.  I know when I came to Chicago people were telling me, "Well that's Chatham, that's different (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Different.
Speaker 1: And this is why," I mean that--what the housing looks like, what the, you know--.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And who lives there.
Speaker 2: It's a--most--a lot of Chatham is newer.  When we moved in, the block where we lived and the immediate area probably wasn't more than five years old at the most I would think, but there were other areas a little bit outside of that.  I don't know if they were technically Chatham or not.  It was--we considered it to be everything from 87th [Street] to 91st [Street] was Chatham, and everything from State Street to Cottage Grove [Avenue], that's kind of the area that we looked at as Chatham, and it was very middle class, all black; but middle class back then was different because you had a lot of different kinds of jobs for people.  You know postal workers and educators and principals and administrators and police officers all lived in the same community, and it made it different because--even though on our block we had kids that were in trouble, but it did not seem, we never thought of ghetto or you know anything like that.  We've had, we've had, my brother Rick [Richard Stephenson III] keeps track of the neighborhood and he lives in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois] right now, but he's told me, you know he runs into people because he a doctor, he runs into people at hospitals who are you know, maybe who have AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] or are alcoholics so they have cirrhosis of the liver or something like that.  So we had people on the block that did get into trouble, that weren't successful, but overall it was an expectation that you were going to be successful.  We had gangs you know in the periphery, Blackstone Rangers, we always heard about them.  I didn't know anybody who was in the Blackstone Rangers that I knew of, but it was, you were expected to go to school, you were expected to go to the library and get books, you were expected to read, you were expected to behave yourself in a certain way, and everybody knew everybody else and adults would call your parents, they--we didn't get spanked by neighbors and I know many neighborhoods kids you could get spanked by you know the lady down the street.  That didn't happen in our neighborhood, but they would be on the phone calling your parents if they saw you doing something wrong, and the parents would thank you if you did that, and then you know then discipline their children, and kids did get spanked by their parents.
Speaker 1: I'm glad you said that because people, everybody for some reason has an idea that they were raised in this village, but nobody else is for some reason.  I don't know what this is (laughter), but there's a--yes there is a difference, I know when I was coming along the neighbors better not spank me either, I mean they would call--
Speaker 2: Right, call.
Speaker 1: If they, they never had to with me, but that would be the way to do it.
Speaker 2: If it was necessary.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know.
Speaker 2: Nowadays things are different though.  You don't call, if you call, if you're a neighbor, well you know it depends on what neighborhood, cause in the neighborhood I am in you can do that, but I know sometimes it's difficult, people are afraid to call parents because they get cursed out or whatever, but in my neighborhood when I was growing up people looked out for each other, they watched out for other peoples' kids.  We cared about each other to a great extent.
Story_ID: 322823
Speaker 1: Was church a part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Not for me, not really. Because my best friend was a Baptist minister's [John Thurston] daughter, I always, I mean it was--we always had faith, I remember in our house we had a little plaque that said Christ is the head of this house, the unseen guest at every meal, the silent listener in every conversation, Jesus I live for you, Jesus I die for you.  I remember that we memorized it, but I don't remember really being active in a church.  Now my parents, my mother [Ruby Jordan Stephenson] is active now and I became active when I must've hit about fifth or sixth grade [at James E. McDade Elementary School; James E. McDade Classical School, Chicago, Illinois].  I joined a Lutheran church and--
Speaker 1: By yourself basically (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother, well my mother is Methodist, actually you know I remember them going to church some, to a Methodist church right around Burnside School [Burnside Elementary School; Burnside Scholastic Academy, Chicago, Illinois], but I don't remember going there a lot.  I remember one period of time maybe I was in Sunday school, but I mean it wasn't, we didn't attend church every single Sunday and it was not the focus of our lives on Sunday, and my friend whose father was a Baptist minister, they were in church all day on Sunday.
Speaker 1: Now Charlotte [Charlotte Thurston], now you may want to speak a little bit about her cause she's a--I think an important person though she's not--died young basically, but.
Speaker 2: Well she was one of my best friends in elementary school, and she was just a really caring person, she was very dynamic.  She was--had the kind of personality where she could get along with almost anybody, and things changed when we got to high school [John Marshall Harlan High School; Harlan Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] and you know we kind of went our separate ways in high school.  We continued to be friends, but we weren't really, really close, but she was just really something else when we were in elementary school.
Speaker 1: Well the reason I raise it 'cause she was, I know she was a very, very active in the Harold Washington campaign.  I met her when I first came to Chicago [Illinois], but she was a--she was married to Conrad Worrill [HistoryMaker Conrad Walter Worrill] at one time and they were very active in the community with Lu Palmer [HistoryMaker Lutrelle "Lu" F. Palmer, II], C. Buck [ph.]--.
Speaker 2: Oh, wow I did not know that.
Speaker 1: And Charlotte was, she was probably one of the hardest working people, Charlotte Thurston, one of the hardest working people in the Harold Washington campaign--.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: At a grass-roots level.  I mean she was really a dynamo.
Speaker 2: I did not know that because we really, we weren't real close once we got to high school, elementary school we were, but she was that way in elementary school, she was just, she was a leader, she was very personable, she was hard working, she got along with everybody and in high school things changed a little bit because she became friends with a group of people that I just really didn't click with you know, and I found another group of people, but she was always very special in my mind, and when I heard that she had died I was very--I was greatly saddened.  I didn't have much contact with her though.
Speaker 1: I think she was teaching at Howard [Howard University, Washington D.C.] I think.  She was in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] I think when she you know, before she got sick in think (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I didn't even know she had gotten married, I didn't know anything you know beyond graduating from high school.
Speaker 1: Well, she was married to Dr. Conrad Worrill for about ten years I think--
Speaker 2: Wow, okay.
Story_ID: 322824
Speaker 1: But at any rate well, we talked about the neighborhood [Chatham, Chicago, Illinois] and what it was like and but it was a--when you visually--can you describe it visually for people?
Speaker 2: It is a beautiful community, and it still is.  It looks the same or even better than it did when we first moved in cause people take very great care of their property, they care about the community, they--my mother [Ruby Jordan Stephenson], her yard always looked like a park.  It was perfectly manicured, bushes, flowers, everything.  It was trees, everything was very, very beautiful and it still is like that.  People care about the neighborhood and they take care for their property.  They watch out for the kids, it's so strange that it's like a pocket that has stayed so much the same even today, and so many other areas have changed so much, but that was--it was a value system that was there.
Speaker 1: I know it's been said that if you're going to be the alderman over there you have to know how to get the trash picked up and the city services.
Speaker 2: Definitely, definitely 'cause those folks don't play, they expect a certain level of service and a certain level of community standard, living and behavior and it doesn't always happen, but that's an expectation and people try to live up to it.  Even to this day when my mother and father [Richard Stephenson, Jr.] sold their house they didn't even put it on the market.  They just told their neighbors that they were going to put the house up for sale and a friend came and brought the house, and I was like, "Ma, how am I gonna ever move back in here," you know because it's so hard, people don't leave, they stay until they die and then their kids inherit the house or whatever.  So I mean that's the kind of neighborhood it is--
Speaker 1: One of the highest voter turnouts in the city.
Speaker 2: I believe it, very, very aware, very, very aware.  I loved growing up in that community--
Speaker 1: You know--
Speaker 2: And if I ever moved out of Oak Park [Illinois], I think there are only two other places I would ever want to live and that would be Chatham and maybe Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois], but I think Chatham would be my first choice, because it just is, it's just where my roots are I feel.
Story_ID: 322825
Speaker 1: You mentioned being interested in history.  Were you interested in--I know you teach gymnastics now, did you start an interest in--
Speaker 2: In gymnastics back then?
Speaker 1: Yeah?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't start gymnastics until I was in college [University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was a junior in college.
Speaker 1: Okay, we're gonna, we'll get to that then, so you didn't--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 1: So you didn't--did you have, what did you have in terms of physical education when you were coming up?
Speaker 2: We played kickball and piggy on the street and over at McDade [James E. McDade Elementary School; James E. McDade Classical School, Chicago, Illinois] playground, we did things at Tuley Park.  We went swimming all the time and played tennis some, actually, yeah I played tennis a lot, I use to be pretty good at it and it and we took--.
Speaker 1: Piggy's like--like its baseball?
Speaker 2: Piggy is where all you need is three people to play baseball with a sixteen inch ball, and you need a pitcher, a catcher and a batter, that's it and we use to play that over at McDade.  We use to take classes at Tuley Park.  I remember taking a stunts and tumbling class and being in day camp, but and doing tap dancing and stuff like that over at Tuley Park, so you know we did a lot of things like that.  In those days though, kids could walk to the park.  You didn't have to be supervised, you didn't have all these strange people you know, predators; so we spent a lot of time at Tuley Park and the interesting thing about Tuley Park is that it had a public library in the field house so you could get every--it was a place to hang out.  You'd go and you'd play, you'd go see if there is anything going in the field house gym, you could go to the library and read or you could just sit on the steps outside of the field house and either read or just talk or play on the--cause it has a huge field and then it had swimming pool and tennis courts, so there was so much to do there that we just go and spend the day there and walk home, get something to eat and then come back, so that's what I remember about the neighborhood.  It was just; there were always things to do.  I wasn't real, real happy with myself in elementary school, I didn't find my niche until high school [John Marshall Harlan High School; Harlan Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] and 'cause I was kind of floating trying to find who do I really like, who really likes me you know, that kind of thing, so I was pretty insecure as an elementary school kid.  In high school, very insecure until sophomore year and then I joined the band, I became a musician.
Story_ID: 322826
Speaker 1: Where did you go to high school first (unclear) off?
Speaker 2: I went to Harlan [John Marshall Harlan High School; Harlan Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] on 96th [Street] and Michigan [Avenue], and I remember taking piano lessons, I took piano when I was in elementary school [James E. McDade Elementary School; James E. McDade Classical School, Chicago, Illinois].  When I got to high school, I joined--I went to a musical that they had at Harlan and at that time Harlan was probably 95 percent black. I think there were maybe four white students in the class of '68 [1968], and we had five in my class, five or six in the class of '69 [1969] which was my class, but when I was a sophomore--
Speaker 1: You were there, now I have to say this, 'cause I have friends who are Harlan chauvinists, everything about Harlan--.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Harlan is the greatest school that ever existed--.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Especially during, and you were there--
Speaker 2: That period of time, yes.
Speaker 1: You were there in the golden age of Harlan, right.  Harlan High School?
Speaker 2: Yes, very, very motivated people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Lots of, yes--
Speaker 2: Very motivated people (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, people came out were very successful.
Speaker 2: Yes, lawyers and just all--judges and all kinds of things, it was--I felt a change the year I graduated because I went back to visit.  We started hearing about somebody getting stabbed in the hallway, and you know one incident, you know of course that blows up in people's minds but those early years through '69 [1969] or '70 [1970] those were golden years at Harlan, and I remember going to a musical called 'Old Ironsides' and I heard the band, the band played and I was blown away by how they sounded and there was one instrument in particular that I just had to know what that sound was, and it turns out it was an alto saxophone, and so I started playing alto sax.  I took beginner's band, but because I could read music, it's, it's so much easier when you can already read music because you can play the piano, you can pick up an instrument and play it, so I was able to progress pretty fast to the concert band by January, and so I was in the main band after that, and that became my life, that became my life in high school.  My best friend played clarinet, my boyfriend who I married, we're divorced now but he was a clarinet player as well, and many--most of my friends were in the band.
Story_ID: 323184
Speaker 1: We're talking about Harlan High School [John Marshall Harlan High School; Harlan Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] and you were in the band, but there's a story we're gonna save here and go back to your return to Harlan.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: We'll cover that at the end, but you were in the band playing saxophone and your social high school life was the band (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Was the band, yes and we were very, very motivated kids.  We loved music and I joined the band because of a man named Mr. Abernathy [ph.], they called him Mr. Ab, and he was just superb.  The kids talked about him--if you talk to any kids in the band today, they would say, "Mr. Ab, Mr. Ab, Mr. Ab" and what happened evidently was Mr. Ab was a full-time sub.  He couldn't pass the National Teachers Exam, and he got bumped by a person who could pass the Teachers Exam who was not anywhere near as good and it was such a shame because when I started on the band, in the band Mr. Ab was gone and this man who, I won't say his name, but he came on and he didn't seem to care about music the way we did, and he had low expectations of what we could accomplish and we wanted to play the big stuff, the you know the big epic-type you know music and he would always say it was too hard, it was too hard.  So what we would do is we would take, we would steal the music from the band room, take it home, and we took our instruments home every day.  The tuba would wear his tuba home every day and we'd get together at somebody's house and play that music and then sneak it back into the band room the next day.  We were that motivated and then we started marching, we had a marching band and we were so proud of ourselves.  We had a uniform and our white shoes and everybody wanted to be Florida A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] and so we would high step, we'd go out and practice every day after school, without the band director, we would just be out there practicing our marching so we would keep our line straight, high stepping and that kind of thing, and I'll never forget the first football game that we marched in and the drum major was (laughter) he was just, I guess kind of quirky and he wasn't paying attention and he marched us on top of the benches and so we're jumping over the benches instead of doing a counter march and we were really upset about that, but we did regrouped and the school was just very, very proud you know of us having a marching band.  So we would go to all the basketball games and all the football games, and it was just such a fun time, and we had concerts.
Speaker 1: Well were games a big deal in those days? I mean cause I, you know, today sometimes when you pass by the stadiums in the City of Chicago [Illinois], they're virtually empty.
Speaker 2: Oh, really.
Speaker 1: And the football teams are playing and there's nobody watching (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, we always were.
Speaker 1: Were games big, football games?
Speaker 2: Yes they were, the football games were big and it didn't matter, I don't even remember if our teams won or lost, I just know that we went as a band and we had such a great time in the stands and in between you know whenever there's a time out the band would play.  I remember playing 'Peter Gunn,' ['Peter Gunn Theme'] we use to play Peter Gunn all the time and some of the you know popular music--that The Temptations or somebody would play and everybody would dance and it was so much fun, and so a lot centered around the band, the band was my life in high school, but there were other people that were, gravitated to the band because we were social people too and we were not, it wasn't a clique so you know everybody was welcome.  So when we'd have concerts there was always a party after the band concert, and I remember, now I don't know if I'm remembering this accurately or not, but in my memory our policy was you can't come to the party if you don't come to the concert.  So kids would come to the concert so that they could come to the party afterwards, and I just remember it being very, very much fun, you know, the very motivated kids.  I also remember that we did have cliques at that school and I'm not a cliquey-type person, and I remember there were a group of people we called the super snobs, and some of them probably are people who've done, I'm sure they've done very well, but teachers treated them differently.  They would address them as Mr. So-and-So and Ms. So-and-So and the rest of were just by first name, so (laughter) it caused some resentment and so I remember I became pretty militant in my junior year or maybe senior year and we decided that we did not want some of those super snobs to be the president of our class and we floated the idea of having a girl run, but in those days that didn't fly either, so we got somebody in who was okay, you know he was kind of goofy, but he was all right in our senior class.
Speaker 1: So why don't we give his name (laughter).
Speaker 2: No, he was also the drum major (laughter), so I don't want to do that but he was a nice guy but you know we were all kind of goofy in high school anyway, but people were very highly motivated.

Speaker 1: We had an Afro club and you know we pushed for African American history and, or what did they call it then, Afro--
Speaker 2: When did you--?
Speaker 1: --American, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but when did you first, now you were coming along in school [John Marshall Harlan High School; Harlan Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], I guess towards middle school and high school in African American history, starting to re-emerge in the high schools--correct me if I'm wrong--in Chicago [Illinois].  I don't know about Chicago, but did it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It did, in our high school we had walkout I think for Afro history, and then we got an Afro history class.  I think that was in my junior year, and--
Speaker 2: Was the information familiar at all to you growing up in Chatham [Chicago, Illinois]?  Now you had two, your parents [Ruby Jordan Stephenson and Richard Stephenson, Jr.] are two black educators, did you have any black history--
Speaker 1: I think I did (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) at home or did-- or did you have it in grade school [James E. McDade Elementary School; James E. McDade Classical School, Chicago, Illinois] at all?
Speaker 1: Well I did in grade school because my fifth grade teacher, fifth, sixth and seventh grade teachers always taught that.  Those three teachers were spectacular teachers, and they were why I wanted to be a teacher, a history teacher because of them,  they just put it on the line, you learned about what was happening in the United States, you learned what happened to other groups of people, you learned about black history so that was something we did know.  I'm sure we talked about it at home cause we--I'm very political and we always argue about politics and I'm sure we did it back then too, just talking about all these issues and stuff and I remember wanting to go to the South to march, so I must have had an awareness actually that those were kids who were marching.
Speaker 2: Did you know anyone who went or had that experience in the South in those days?
Speaker 1: Not that I remember, I don't know of anyone that did go.
Speaker 2: Now I just wondered if you know, somewhere along the line you met someone who had been to, you know, who had volunteered and gone down, gone south either in med school (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I would have thought Charlotte [Charlotte Thurston] and her family might have been and especially since they knew Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], that they may have done that.  I just don't remember anybody talking about having gone, and see by that time Charlotte was not out with us you know when we were playing kickball and stuff, she was more you know involved in the church [New Covenant Missionary Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois] and you know maybe civil rights stuff in terms of her church.
Story_ID: 323186
Speaker 1: Now did you meet Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] yourself, did get a chance to meet him?
Speaker 2: I had a chance to see him, but never just meet him directly.
Speaker 1: So he spoke at the church [New Covenant Missionary Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois] basically?
Speaker 2: He would speak at the church but he also spoke at Cole Park [Nat King Cole Park] over on 83rd [Street] and King Drive [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive] and everybody went over there to listen to him speak.
Speaker 1: So you were part of that group that heard?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to remember if I missed that or if I was there, 'cause I can't remember what year that was.  He was assassinated in '68 [1968].  I was a junior [at John Marshall Harlan High School; Harlan Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] so I was still at home.
Speaker 1: Do you remember his assassination and where you were?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes we were in school when we heard that he had died.  We heard he had been shot the night before and we were in school when we found out he died and the whole school, my recollection is, not a word, everybody got up and walked out, and I remember walking down South Park Boulevard [South Parkway], which is now King Drive, nobody talking.  We blocked the traffic, and everything, it was just students walking and we didn't tear up anything, but we just walked out of school and walked home and then that's all I remember about that and then being, seeing the riots on the West Side, you know after that, so and people were angry, we were angry and you know we were just starting to you know become more militant, Malcolm X was someone we didn't know a lot about and weren't sure if we agreed with him or not and then Warith Mohammad [Warith Deen Mohammed], he was married to my next door neighbor's sister, so we knew of the Nation of Islam and we knew who he was and we knew, who did we know--we knew his daughter because she was close to our age, a little bit younger, but close to our age. So we knew about the Nation of Islam, we knew about Malcolm X, but we weren't sure where--a lot of us were sure where we stood on him cause we were still you know supporting Dr. King, he was the one that people were supporting.  I remember some people starting to say you know after the speech he did, he started talking about Vietnam [Vietnam War] and people felt he shouldn't be talking about Vietnam; he was not entitled to do that, he should only talk about race issues.  I remember that and I--.
Speaker 1: Why, did they feel that way?
Speaker 2: I think because he was the leader of the Civil Rights Movement as we saw it and some people felt that that's what he should stick with and not spread himself so thin cause he was--I remember--.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) it might antagonize the Democrats who were in power that were allies and so (unclear).
Speaker 2: Right, right and then he also, he was there I think when he was assassinated about one of the unions going on strike, and there were people who felt that he shouldn't get involved in that either.  So people were starting to feel that Dr. King's way wasn't going to work, I remember that.  That, you know violence you know they're gonna--and then people said, look at what they did to him and he was peaceful, so you know violence, nonviolence doesn't work and I remember also you know looking at the marches and seeing people--I remember when he came to Chicago [Illinois] and marched in Marquette Park, and had rocks and things thrown at him and you know people were starting to say, shoot, if they did that to me I'd throw rocks back, you know I'm not gonna stand there and let them take it, you know just take it and --
Speaker 1: The Selma march [Selma to Montgomery March] did actually end up--like he said it was the most violent march he's ever been involved in I mean (unclear).
Speaker 2: In Marquette Park?  I remember some years later when I was married, my husband played semi-pro football and I remember them having a game in Marquette Park, and this was, let's see this had to be ten, fifteen years later and I remember going to be a spectator, and it's not a stadium, it's just a park, and I got there with him and went into a store to buy something and I remember the hostility still in Marquette Park.
Story_ID: 323187
Speaker 1: So those were some interesting times, but I remember, and I remember, I'm trying to remember the timeframe for the Fred Hampton and Mark Clark you know, killings by the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's 1969.
Speaker 1: Okay I thought it was right around there.
Speaker 2: So '68 [1968] you would have been in the--
Speaker 1: I was a junior and that's at Harlan [John Marshall Harlan High School; Harlan Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] and that's when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed and then next year, and we weren't sure what the ramifications of that were, you know what really happened, and then of course the government had one side of the story and then years later the real truth came out, but that was when we were starting to become more militant, and when I graduated from high school, I got a 'fro and I had an afro for thirty years, in fact I just stopped wearing my hair that way, I revert back to it you know, sometimes cause I feel comfortable with it that way, but my gray hair just kind of went crazy so that's when I stopped wearing a 'fro.  That was just last year, but we were very aware you know, black consciousness, everything was black power and--
Speaker 2: Well, what did the hair mean at that time, what did it mean?
Speaker 1: For me?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I went to UIC [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] and I had not had much contact with white people at all except teachers.  At my high school, my graduating class maybe had five white students, of which some didn't associate really with me in particular.  One we called the blue-eyed soul brother, so he was with us, he was on the football team and he would hang around with us, so I didn't know whites at all.  When I got to UIC it was the first time I had ever been outnumbered in my life, I thought Chicago [Illinois] was black (laughter).  I really did, I grew up in Chatham [Chicago, Illinois]; I thought Chicago was mostly black and I knew when I'd go downtown on the bus there were a lot of white people down there but it didn't bother me cause I thought that's just a fluke in this particular day or whatever, and so I did not want white students to feel that I felt I had to be like them, that I could be who I was and my father [Richard Stephenson, Jr.] and I had terrible fights about that, because he hated my hair, he hated my hair and we use to argue, you know teenagers get to that point where they start arguing with their parents a lot, but the only time that he ever backed down on an argument was when I told him about that, that I do not want those white students to feel that I am trying to be like them, that I do not have to be like them, that I am intelligent without trying to be like them, and since I had a reason I guess, he just decided I was hardheaded enough and, but he hated my hair until last year (laughter), so but I remember that.
Speaker 2: I have often wondered, I use to wonder when I was a kid like why black women straighten their hair out and why we, we've--that's such a big deal you know and I couldn't, I mean it's--as a kid (unclear).
Speaker 1: I still have problems with it, I really do.  I still have problems with it which is why I will let it go and end up being an afro until my gray hair starts going all over the place and I can't control it, and then I say okay I gotta go do something, but I guess in my mind because I don't feel that hair in its natural state is anything to be ashamed of, then I can wear my hair any way I want to and so then I don't feel as bad about straightening it, but it bothers me that when people do feel that they cannot have their hair in its natural state, you know what is wrong with that?  You know there's nothing wrong with that and so I'm very, I'm still militant about that, that we do not need to change to be like anyone else, we have value as we are and we need to respect ourselves.
Story_ID: 323188
Speaker 1: When I taught at Unity [Unity Catholic High School, Chicago, Illinois], I use to teach at Unity High School when I graduated from UIC [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], I came back and Unity isn't there anymore, it was on 81st [Street] and Prairie [Avenue] and they have the townhomes there.  I taught American history, black history, African history, women--women's studies and the Future and we talked about all those kinds of things, and I thought the '60 [1960] movement, the Black Power movement of the '60s [1960s] would take, black is beautiful, black power, all of that, I thought it would take, I thought that was it, we would be that way forever, and when I went back to Unity I started teaching there in 1973, I was shocked that of the phrases that I heard coming out of black kids' mouths, you know, good hair, she's too dark to wear that color, you know that kind of stuff, I was just horrified and I was one of only seven lay teachers at that school, cause that school had been a Catholic school, I mean it was a Catholic school and nuns were starting to leave the convent, and so there were seven of us that were hired, I don't know if we all came in the same year or not, but I believe in my mind I always had it that there were only seven of us that were lay teachers, two or three of us were black and the others were white, and I remember feeling that they had dropped the standards, the academic standards at the school.  It had gone from white middle class to black middle class and then from there they started merging schools you know, maybe the enrollment dropped, so they merged Mercy High School [Chicago, Illinois] with another school, I think it was Visitation High School [Chicago, Illinois] and the reputation--I don't know if this was true or not because I came much later, but the reputation that kids told me about was that Visitation had been a school where a lot of girls had gotten pregnant, and so they merged it--well if it's Chatham [Chicago, Illinois] kids that are going there, they're not going to wanna be in a school with kids who are coming from another area that is not as, quote, middle class, so I think that was almost the kiss of death right there, to merge a middle clas- upper middle class black school with a low--considered to be lower class black school, you get those problems, and then with it having a reputation of it being a pregnancy school, that is going to, that's not gonnna fly, so a lot of people, you know the school started turning over.  By the time I got there it was called Unity and there were certain things that happened there that I felt were racist.  One of them was we didn't have a tardy bell, so the bell would ring, so classes would be dismissed and then every teacher decided when the kids should be in the classroom or not, and I felt, and kids were hanging out in the hall, some teachers would give the kids twenty minutes or ten minutes and so there was disorder.  I felt there was disorder there, and I felt the standards had been dropped at that school.  I remember when I taught history, American history, I felt these kids are college bound, they need to learn how to do a term paper, and I was told by one of the principals, "You can't have those kids do that, that's too hard." And I remember feeling that, that was definitely racist to say that they cannot do something, you know that it's too hard.  They need to be able to do that if they get to college, so I had my sophomores doing it, I had my juniors doing it, and we were always asking for you know support from the administration in terms of discipline and things like that, and I just remember feeling that we didn't really get it.
Speaker 2: Now when where you at Unity?
Speaker 1: I was at Unity from 1973 to 1979.
Story_ID: 323189
Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna take you back to high school graduation [from John Marshall Harlan High School; Harlan Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] (laughter)--.
Speaker 2: Okay, high school, okay.
Speaker 1: Where we can get you--your senior year was 1969?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-nine [1969], yes.
Speaker 1: And so had you thought about where you were going to go to school, I know you were going--your parents [Ruby Jordan Stephenson and Richard Stephenson, Jr.] would have you on some kind of college track, right?
Speaker 2: They did, although it's interesting, in high school the first teacher who ever said something to me about how I could better than I was doing was a white teacher when I was a sophomore.  She said, "Why are you trying to hang around with those kids?"  And see I knew they didn't like me but they were the only people that I knew.  "Why are you trying to hang around with those kids?  You can do better."  And she was a young white teacher and in my senior year the one teacher who discouraged me from going to college was a black teacher, she said--I had applied to Uni- UIC [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] which was called Circle.  I applied a lot of places cause my dad and I fought, you know as I was getting more headstrong and he's hardheaded too, we argued a lot and so I applied to the University of Hawaii, the University of Puerto Rico and the University of California, but I ended up going to UIC, but this one teacher discouraged me, she didn't feel that I had the skill and the intelligence (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, were your grades high, I mean did?
Speaker 2: My grades were okay.  I--in a class of 700 or let's says 650, I was number sixty, so I mean that's pretty good, but I wasn't a good test taker, I was okay on the SAT or ACT, but I wasn't a great test taker, but she just, she discouraged me and my mom was really angry about that and then when I went to UIC, I experienced culture shock because it was the first time I'd ever been outnumbered in my life.  I was terrified.
Speaker 1: Now how did you end up choosing UIC?
Speaker 2: 'Cause it was close.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause it was close and I lived at home through that.
Speaker 1: Well, everybody does in high school but, but did you (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But I mean going--
Speaker 1: Did you imagine yourself living away or going away?
Speaker 2: I did but, well one thing my parents didn't feel they could afford it so I needed to go somewhere close that was not that expensive, and at that time UIC was something like sixty dollars a quarter and I got a teacher's scholarship, so I mean it was cheap back in those days.
Speaker 1: So was that okay with you then, I mean 'cause, you know.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Oh, I loved UIC, I really did.  Actually in my life I don't think there is anything that I would change, because everything that I have now is connected to all of that so, I mean if I hadn't gone to UIC I would not have gotten into gymnastics, because that's where I got involved in gymnastics, and you know everything else would, you know I wouldn't have a gym now and you know just all of that would be different.
Story_ID: 323190
Speaker 1: One more thing before we leave high school, I didn't ask you about 'Star Trek' (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh (laughter).
Speaker 1: It came on the air in '66 [1966] I believe and--
Speaker 2: We looked at that at home. I looked at that at home and my boyfriend who was in the band who I eventually married was a big, huge 'Star Trek' fan and so we would look at, we always looked at science fiction.  My dad [Richard Stephenson, Jr.] is a science fiction person, so we always looked at science fiction and I remember, I remember my father when--on the episode where Uhura kisses Spock, there's this alien that makes them kiss each against their will, and I remember my father saying, "Just lost Mississippi," 'cause he knew they would just turn it off, they'd cut the program in Mississippi, I'll never forget that.  That was so funny.
Speaker 1: So an African American and a Vulcan you know--.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: They couldn't kiss (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Couldn't even kiss an alien.
Speaker 1: --unless they infuriate Mississippi.  I see (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right. Right. So I remember that and we use to look at it all the time, those were fun times.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Did you like music in--well you played in band [at John Marshall Harlan High School; Harlan Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], but did you like the, I guess like funk was becoming popular in a sense.
Speaker 2: I liked everything, I liked all kinds of music and I still do, and you know in those days it was hard if you like all kinds of music.  Well in the band we always did and we competed in the band so we played classical music and we played all kinds of music.  We had our band ensembles and our little quartets and all that and we were really, we were very serious about our music, and so I remember going in '68 [1968] to watch our band, ensemble competition which was held at Austin High School [Chicago, Illinois] and I had never even heard of Austin High School.  I had never heard of Oak Park [Illinois], but we took the "L" to Austin [Chicago, Illinois] and went to Austin High School and watched our competitors and I remember hearing this oboe that was so awesome.  I don't remember who competed if they were black or white, I know there were blacks and whites there, but it was not something that I really paid attention to, but we had high superiors and superiors in our band, they were just spectacular.  That was the year that Mr. Ab [Mr. Abernathy (ph.)] was there, the next year the other person was there and we went to ensemble competition, I remember I was in an ensemble competition as a junior and we were, what did we get?  We were like excellent, and then in my senior year in high school, we were in ensemble competition and I believe we got a superior, but high superior was the best and I remember going into the auditorium because you wanted to hear the ensembles that got high superiors, so we were very serious about classical music, about all kinds of music.  I mean we played Temptations' [The Temptations] stuff and we play you know some of the popular stuff but we were also into classical.  I remember liking The Beatles and that wasn't something that black students were supposed to, so you know if I listened to The Beatles, I'd turn it down a little bit so nobody would hear, you know, I remember '(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction' was one that crossed over.  That was one of the few songs when I--in that neighborhood that crossed over and black and white listened to, but it was a lot of fun.
Speaker 1: Well you raised an interesting point that in the black community, black people felt--feel obligated to listen to black music, I mean in a lot of ways they feel obligated.
Speaker 2: Right, yes only black music many times, and you know with gymnastics I experienced it that even when I had my gym [Lynn Allen's Gymnastic Center] on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois], I think the highest enrollment I ever had was about 110 kids, but I remember a kid quitting because she said it was a white sport, she decided it was a white sport.  I guess people had told her, why are you doing gymnastics, that's not a black sport, so we still go through that now.  I am always trying to recruit black kids to come into the sport.
Story_ID: 323191
Speaker 1: Well alright UIC [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], so you started UIC in the fall of '69 [1969]?
Speaker 2: Sixty-nine [1969] yep.
Speaker 1: So that is the fall that Fred Hampton and--
Speaker 2: Mark Clark were killed?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I believe so, yeah, they were killed that December I think.
Speaker 2: Okay, I remember there were protests, we left school, we were protesting about that kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: That was a West Side--yeah, UIC's on the West Side of Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Right, yes.
Speaker 1: Just to put it in perspective.
Speaker 2: It was very scary, and then you know we started realizing the media were portraying the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party] as a certain group, you know and they didn't help because they scared people so much, they scared black people and white people, and I remember the Black Muslims were, you know they would stand out in a suit and a tie and they were doing what I thought we should be doing, building up economic power, and you know, independent of the white community, and so the Muslims had Salaam Restaurant [Salaam Restaurant and Bakery, Chicago, Illinois] and they had a bakery on 79th Street and they had all those things and we were very, very proud of that, the Panthers--
Speaker 1: Drycleaners, a supermarket.
Speaker 2: Yes, the Panthers though, were kind of scary because, well you'd have a Muslim selling the newspaper.  The Panthers would curse at you, they'd curse at you if you didn't buy their paper, or they tried to intimidate you so we, you know we didn't know how we felt about that quite, even though we went along with the protests, we weren't quite sure how we felt about the Panthers until later and then you heard about the breakfast programs, and you know that kind of stuff, but you didn't hear about that a whole lot.
Speaker 1: Did you know any Panthers when you were at UIC?
Speaker 2: No, or at least not that I knew of.  There were, there was a Black Student Organization at UIC, but the school was intimidating for me as a freshman.  A freshman, I didn't open my mouth the whole first year I was there.
Story_ID: 323192
Speaker 1: We were talking about UIC [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) UIC--you said you were intimidated by the, you and the student union, and it was just intimidating?
Speaker 1: Well when I first went in, the first building I went into at UIC I think was the library, and I had never seen that many white in one place in my life.  I was terrified, I'm not kidding, I looked I saw two water fountains side-by-side and I was looking for white and colored signs, now I never grew up in an area like that, but I never had to think about it, and you know the first think I'm thinking is why do they have two water fountains side-by-side, that doesn't even make any sense.  One is sufficient, so I knew there had to be you know, you could use one or the other and I'm looking for signs, so I mean I was really scared.  Going into the student union, the black students there, maybe they were more militant than I was, but I didn't perceive that.  I perceived clique you know, there was a clique, people look you up and down when you walk in the door, you know that kind of thing, and so I never went back into the, I think I went into the student union one time and I never went back.
Speaker 2: Well did you have any friends that went to UIC?
Speaker 1: Sure, but I found people in the Behavioral Science Building [Behavioral Sciences Building (BSB)] which was like--I don't know how I found that place, but it was a like rat's maze, the--it was a--like a cafeteria but you walked down a ramp and there are little booths along there and it just kept going around and around and around and around and around, and so that's where I went and that's where, well my boyfriend was you know there you know and his friends and lot of education majors were in the Behavioral--in BSB.
Speaker 2: Okay, this is your same boyfriend from high school [John Marshall Harlan High School; Harlan Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Yes, we went together through high school, through college and got married and then we got divorced about twenty-three years later, so we were together for a long time, but so I had a lot of education-major friends, and I was an education major, he was an education major, so that's where we you know use to hang out over there, but it was not an exclusive group, you know we welcomed different kinds of people, so it wasn't, it didn't have the same feel to me as you know somebody walking into the student union and being looked up and down like, who are you, who do you think you are, you think you are something, that was a different feel and you have to admit I was a very populist-type person, so you know I'm looking at not creating a, an elite group at the top but being more inclusive of all kinds of people and that's why you know in high school we were at odds with that group of people we called the super snobs because they felt that they were smarter than everybody else, that they were--had more going that anyone else and therefore they were better than everybody else and they did not need to associate with other people, and my group in high school we were, you know, let's go walking and talk, or ride bikes you know, we were involved in, we were interested in politics and interested in the Black Power movement and stuff, but we were not exclusive, so we had lots of people in our group. One--I had sort of two groups but they overlapped, so that you know, band was my main group, but then we had another group that kind of was on the periphery of the band and they knew they were always welcome, band people were always welcome.  In college, that cliquish stuff, I still don't like it and it just had that feel, whether that was real or not, I don't know, cause I didn't stay around long enough to find out if it, if I could break into that circle, I didn't even care to, didn't even attempt to, so we had our own little group of mostly education majors.
Story_ID: 323193
Speaker 1: You didn't really get involved in the Black Student Organization there on campus?
Speaker 2: No, no not all.
Speaker 1: Okay, well was there an African American studies department or black studies or?
Speaker 2: There was but it's interesting, I took an African American history class or black history class, I don't remember what it was called back then and it was taught by a white teacher.
Speaker 1: Well who was it?
Speaker 2: What was his name?  I cannot remember, he wrote a book called 'Puttin' on Ole Massa' ['Puttin' On Ole Massa: The Slave Narratives of Henry Bibb, William Wells Brown, and Solomon Northup'] and--.
Speaker 1: Gilbert Osofsky?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes Osofsky.
Speaker 1: Now how did I know that (laughter)?
Speaker 2: That's (laughter).
Speaker 1: Gilbert Osofsky. O-S-A-F?
Speaker 2: I think it was O-S-O-F-S-K-Y.
Speaker 1: O-S-A-F, yeah right, S-K-Y, Osofsky, Gilbert Ofosfky, right.
Speaker 2: Yes, and I really didn't like him.  I did not like him and you know I would, we would ask questions.  He came off to me as I recall, as a white person who thinks he's an expert on black people, and I just didn't like it, you know we'd ask questions and he'd put you down, you know and but I did have a white professor cause I didn't have, I don't remember any black professors at the UIC [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], I mean not that I had, but I remember a white professor who was from Switzerland and he was teaching some kind of sociology class that had to do with black history or you know race relations or something, and there were only two or three black kids in the class and we use to love that class.  We called him Super Wit and the white students hated him.  They hated him and the black students just loved him, because one of the first things he said on the first day of class was, "You will learn that it is not so great to be white in America, you know, your history, you have done, whites have done some things in history that you should be ashamed of." And they were on him and they always tried to trip him up on things, and they never could trip him up and we would just sit back and just laugh so, I mean that was black history.  I was into that kind of stuff, but I did probably more reading on my own than taking the class.  By the time I was starting to really speak out, well I was a sophomore and I got into an argument with a white student because what he was doing is he was talking about how blacks are the cause of every social problem in this country and he started rattling out how blacks are, you know, responsible for this welfare situation and blacks are responsible for all the crime in this county and all this stuff, and I just could not take it anymore and we started arguing and we argued--it started in think in biology, in a biology lab and we argued so much you know the teacher said, "You guys are gonna have to take that outside," you know, and we argued 'cause he was trying to say--I said, "Do you know that there are more white people on welfare than blacks, and do you know--" and of course for some people you know you can't convince them, don't confuse them with the facts, so after that I wasn't letting anything else go, so that was when I--I guess, woke up and became even more militant in college, so--.
Speaker 1: What by militant--now people throw that term around.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But were you really militant--?
Speaker 2: Well militant if it means (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In terms of being ready to tear something up or?
Speaker 2: No, not tearing, but I mean I was militant in terms of identifying myself as a black person, not trying to be anybody else, knowing my history and wanting to do something for the community and so, I mean I wore a 'fro and it was just my statement that I don't have to have straight hair and I don't have to listen to your music, I can do whatever I wanna do and be an intelligent successful person and so to me I guess that's when I say I was militant, that's what I mean, you know, not the scaring people or threatening people or anything like that.  I wasn't even a, you know, power--that kind of thing, I was more, I wanna do something for the community.  I wanna go back and teach in the community and--.
Speaker 1: It had more to do more with self-determination.
Speaker 2: Economic self-determination and political, you know, electing people in the community who represent us and having businesses that represent, that are reflective of the community, cause even in Chatham [Chicago, Illinois] today, the business areas don't look--tend to not look as the community, the neighborhood where the houses are, and but I remember we didn't even have a Jewel Grand Bazaar, we didn't have Toys 'R' Us we didn't have any of those things.  You had to go to Evergreen Plaza [Evergreen Park, Illinois], which I understand now is all black, which I didn't know.
Speaker 1: Well, yeah people refer to it as Everblack Plaza now.
Speaker 2: Oh really? Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: I mean it's a community, you know phrase, sort of a lingo thing.
Speaker 2: Oh okay, so anywhere that's where I was in terms of you know I wanted to teach black history, I wanted to you know, just raise consciousness of our kids and then you know do something back--give something back to the community.  A lot of people who graduated from Harlan [John Marshall Harlan High School; Harlan Community Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] were like that, there are a lot of them.  There are a couple of people who are teaching at Harlan now.  I know of one who is a social worker, I know of one--at least one who is a teacher so you know that's the way we were.
Story_ID: 323194
Speaker 1: Now when I was a junior, I decided that I wanted to learn gymnastics.  I just, it was, you know when you walk through UIC [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] and you see these huge fields, I just wanted to run and flip, but I didn't know how to flip, so I went to, you know I took classes.  I have always been fairly athletic so you know I would take P.E. [physical education] classes and all that.  So I hired somebody to teach me how to do a cartwheel and--.
Speaker 2: You hired somebody from where?
Speaker 1: From UIC, one of the girls on the team.  It was all white girls; there weren't any blacks on the team at that time.
Speaker 2: So she wouldn't just teach you, you had to pay her?
Speaker 1: Yeah, or she might have, but well you know what, see it was strange because once I decided I wanted to do gymnastics, I took a stunts and tumbling class; she taught me how to do a cartwheel.  I took a stunts and tumbling class and then I decided I wanted to learn more, so I would go into the gym whenever I had free time and work out, but I didn't know what to do and I remember going in after school to work out and I would just keep working out.  I'd try to watch and see what the kids are doing, nobody--I was the only black person there and I would watch to see what they were doing and then I would try it, and they would just laugh 'cause I'd fall on my head, I'd fall on my back, I was falling all the time and they would just laugh, and I got discouraged and then I said to myself, you know what?  I'm not letting them stop me from doing something I want to do.  I'm gonna keep coming back, I'm going to keep going there until learn how to do some of those things, and I guess they decided that if I was gonna keep coming back they would give me tips every so often and so someone would give me a tip, "You know you could kick harder," or whatever and so then I'd do that, then somebody else later would say, "You know, why don't you do it this way or use this mat or whatever," so anyway I ended up getting on the team in my senior year.  Now that's low-level gymnastics, gymnastics is nowhere near what it is now, but it was a good accomplishment for someone to go from nothing to competing on the team.  I was the only black person on the team.  There were only six of us on the women's team.  The men's team was big you know they had a lot of you know people with a lot of background, but I was on the team and I competed and I was one of the top all-arounders, you know very strong on the floor, very strong on bars and vault, and I just loved it and when I graduated I hadn't had enough of it.  So I knew I was teaching and I started a gymnastics club at Unity High School [Unity Catholic High School, Chicago, Illinois] and we practiced every day, you know kids would come in and make fun of the girls sometimes, but I remember one girl when my back was turned, this girl kept needling her and so she said, "Well you come out and do it if it is so easy," and the girl came out and tried it and almost killed herself, you know ended, that gained a lot of respect for the club.  Kids started coming up just to watch to see what they were doing and then I decided we were going to be a team and compete and when we started competing, we--the only teams, there were no other teams in Chicago [Illinois]--
Story_ID: 323195
Speaker 1: So, but let's go back a little bit now, now when you came out of--when did you graduate from UIC [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I graduated in 1973.  I had a major in history, secondary education and a minor in physical education.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they would call it a-- would we call that degree a--?
Speaker 2: Bachelor of arts in teaching of history.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay in history education or is that teaching of history (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Teaching of history because in, for high school that's sixth through twelve I believe, it includes--or seven through twelve I think is a certificate.  You get it just in history, teaching history.  It's not considered--elementary education is a completely different major, so it's you know it's a different kind of thing, but so I had a major in history and minor in physical education and I started teaching at Unity [Unity Catholic High School, Chicago, Illinois] in '73 [1973].  When we, when the gymnastics team started competing, there were no, I think Dunbar [Dunbar Vocational High School; Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] might have had a gymnastics team for a little while, and maybe Kenwood [Kenwood High School; Kenwood Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] or some other, there might be--have been two high schools that had gymnastics for girls, so most of the teams that we competed against were the white suburban teams.  Now they start gymnastics when they are two years old, and my girls were coming learning how to do these things.  I'd very rarely had kids--sometimes I'd have kids who knew how to do things already, but most of the time I had to teach them everything.  It's impossible to do well under those circumstances.  So I started a gym, and that was my first gym.  I decided I was going to start a gym.
Speaker 1: Now when was that?
Speaker 2: That was in '77 [1977].
Speaker 1: Okay, you came out in '73 [1973].  When did you start at Unity?
Speaker 2: I started right away in the fall of 1973 and started a gymnastics club probably--.
Speaker 1: So 1977 you started a--okay.
Speaker 2: Well the club at the high school we, you know we're playing around with that, but I think it must have been about '76 [1976] when I started thinking about opening a gym--.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because my girls were getting thrashed you know by suburban kids, so I ran a program at Unity, a summer program at Unity for kids in the neighborhood and the next year in '77 [1977] I opened a gym at 77th [Street] and Cottage Grove [Avenue] in a little bitty storefront.  I got a five thousand dollar loan from Oak Park Trust and Savings Bank [Oak Park, Illinois], which is interesting because I went to Provident--I went to Seaway Bank [Seaway National Bank; Seaway Bank and Trust Company, Chicago, Illinois] and they turned me down and I went to Lake Shore Bank [Chicago, Illinois] and they turned me down, but Oak Park Bank gave me the loan, unsecured for five thousand dollars.
Speaker 1: Now were you married by this time?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  I got married right out of college, as soon as I graduated we got married, so and we were living in Oak Park [Illinois] cause Al [ph.] was one of the first black teachers at Oak Park River Forest High School [Oak Park and River Forest High School, Oak Park, Illinois], so he was already living out at in Oak Park, cause otherwise I had never even heard of Oak Park, so he was living out there and we moved.  So he--I just moved in with him once we got married.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--.
Speaker 2: But so I was still commuting to the South Side [Chicago, Illinois], and so I opened my first gym on 77th [Street] and Cottage Grove.  It was a little storefront.
Speaker 1: Now this is right next to the Thurston's [John Thurston] church, New Covenant Church [New Covenant Missionary Baptist Church, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yes, right.  It was across the street.
Speaker 1: I just thought I'd raise that since your best friend in grade school was Charlotte Thurston.
Speaker 2: Yes--.
Speaker 1: But right across the street.
Speaker 2: But I still didn't have any contact (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --with her.  I knew Covenant was there though 'cause it was a big church and it was very popular and very well know, but so I was at 77th and Cottage Grove, right across the street. I don't even know if the building is still there.  I don't think it is.  It was Marquette Auto Parts, was the owner and my gym was upstairs on the, oh, no, wait that's not right that was 73rd [Street].  Seventy-seventh and Cottage Grove was a tiny storefront; that was my first one.  Was that across from New Covenant?  I guess maybe that's where it was, but anyway so we ran--I ran a program for the community kids and for my girls from the high school, so that they would be ready for competition.  I think it started as Lynn Allen's Gymnastic Center [Chicago, Illinois], and then two years later in 1979 I incorporated it not-for-profit, and then moved down the street to 73rd and Cottage Grove and that was where Marquette Auto Parts was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There was a senior day care center on the corner and Marquette Auto Parts, and then I was upstairs in a bigger warehouse, and it was a good program, it was a very good program.
Story_ID: 323196
Speaker 1: I remember when Alvin Ailey came to Chicago [Illinois].  I chartered a bus, or I--I'm trying to think if we had one bus or two buses?  Chartered buses, I think it was two buses to take the kids downtown to a dance concert because most of them had never seen anything like that and I wanted them to see.  It was either Alvin Ailey or [HistoryMaker] Arthur Mitchell.  I think it was Arthur Mitchell actually and I said, "You're going to, you know, if you like something you clap your hands and you say bravo, bravo," and they thought I was crazy. And then I said, you know, "This is the way you're gonna dress," and we took these buses down to the Auditorium Theatre [Chicago, Illinois] and the kids just had a great time, parents and kids went and then they saw that you do clap and say bravo and there's a certain way you act because I wanted to make sure they were very well behaved, and so we did all kinds of things like that, cultural things with the kids but we had them competing, and I remember we- I didn't have all the money to get all the best equipment, and one of the pieces of equipment that I could not afford was a horse.  I don't know if you are familiar with gymnastics where they vault (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A pommel horse?
Speaker 1: Well it's like the pommel horse but without the pommels on it.  So you run and you fly over it, and I couldn't afford that.  So what we did is I had some mats that were pretty solid, not folding mats and so we would drape them over the balance beam and that would hold them up and then the kids would vault over that, and they were doing hand springs and all kinds of things and my kids were getting pretty good and I remember wanting to have a home meet, but there were no other black teams so we hosted this meet and people, I guess they said they were gonna come and then they backed out at the last minute because they said their parents wouldn't let their kids come into Chicago 'cause Chicago was too bad, and I was really, really angry about that and somebody I guess contacted [HistoryMaker] Harry Porterfield.  He came out and did a story on my gym [Lynn Allen's Gymnastic Center, Chicago, Illinois] and I had a little girl at the time who was about thirty--weighed about thirty-six pounds, she was very tiny, and African American, all my kids were black and she was just very talented and I called her my Olympic hopeful for 1988 I think is what I said, and she still is the most talented kid I have ever coached in my life, and I've coached some others kids that were close but this little girl, Agina Simpkins was just phenomenal, and she learned so many things in one day and she just loved gymnastics.  So her mom would drop her off on Saturday and I said she could stay all day as long as she wanted to and then when she was ready to come her mother--she'd call her mom and her mom would come pick her up.  That kid would stay from nine in the morning until four o'clock  She was only about seven years old, but he came and did a story on me and Agina and the gym and it so happened that it was around the time that these teams would not come in to Chicago to compete, and I was kind of sensitive about it because with my team at the high school, we competed and they had to come to my high school to compete but they didn't want to and the schools, the kids would walk in and say, "Oh, it's so clean," and the kids would get really--my students would get really angry.  What did they think they were gonna see?  Because Unity [Unity Catholic High School, Chicago, Illinois] was always immaculate, the kids conducted themselves pretty well and so they were insulted by these white kids coming from Mother McAuley [Mother McAuley Liberal Arts High School, Chicago, Illinois] or you know whatever coming over being surprised that a ghetto school could be clean.  So I was kind of sensitive about that and when these teams refused to come, I was really irate, but one team did agree to come and they were scared but they came, and so Harry Porterfield's crew was there and they filmed it, and I look back on it and I say, boy I was really, (laughter) I was outrageous, I was outrageous because I was still angry about it so at gymnastics meets you always start the meet with the National Anthem ['The Star Spangled Banner'].  I started our meet with the Negro National Anthem ['Lift Every Voice and Sing'] (laughter) and I look back on that and I say I can't believe I did that (laughter), but you know I didn't want to feel uncomfortable, but I mean I wanted to make a point that we can do, you know, it's safe here, you are not gonna get mugged and all that kind of stuff, but so that was one of the things that you know we had people come to our gym.
Story_ID: 323197
Speaker 1: And then in, oh I guess about 1980 and '81 [1981] I started having problems with the landlord.  He was, he became ill and he wasn't able to maintain the property and the person who was supposed to keep the building up wasn't doing it.  I had my first child in '82 [1982] and at around that--shortly after that the building started really becoming run down and a steam pipe--the ceiling started leaking and a steam pipe burst and steam started shooting in the room and it took this guy so long to fix it.  It got to the point where we just could not function and--were you looking for the address?  Oh.
Speaker 2: No, I'm just--
Speaker 1: Okay, we couldn't function so I closed--I had to close the gym [Lynn Allen's Gymnastics Center, Chicago, Illinois] and for a time I found a new home at South Shore YMCA [Chicago, Illinois], but their main programs are basketball and swimming, so you know when they said, "Can you put your gym in this little closet area?" it was like, you know, I can't do this.  So--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know exactly the space you're talking about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: It is the space upstairs and it has weights in it and something. And they wanted you to operate out of that?
Speaker 1: Right, and I was, but for a while but then they started saying, "Well can you operate in--," and literally they were looking at a closet.  I was like, "No, I can't do it."  So I closed and left that gym, that place and I knew--I had been living in Oak Park [Illinois] all this time and so I happened--I had also taught some classes with the park district in the evenings, so I knew someone in the park district and I said to her, "Would you like to have a year-around gymnastics program?" and she said, "Yeah."  So we sat down and met and what we ended up doing is moving my equipment from South Shore YMCA to the Oak Park park district.  There were two small buildings.
Story_ID: 323198
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now what kind of equipment did you--now you mentioned that you didn't have a--
Speaker 2: A horse for vaulting (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A horse, but what did you have?  You had a balance beam right?
Speaker 2: We had a couple of balance beams and we had uneven parallel bars and we had mats for floor exercise, not a big--not a big carpeted one.  If you look at the Olympics now there is a forty-five by forty-five foot carpeted surface that has mats underneath.  We didn't have that, we just had mats we put them in strategic places and the kids could compete that way, but gymnastics wasn't what it is now.  You could not possibly function doing what they're doing now with the equipment we had.  So you know, as equipment has gotten better, then the skills get better and the training and the conditioning get better, then the kids are more capable of doing higher level skills.  Back in those days they did some good things, but it was not, it was not what the kids are doing now at the highest levels anyway.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was a little--there's a black girl that competed in the Olympics in the, I'm thinking in the late '80s [sic.].
Speaker 2: Dominique Dawes?
Speaker 1: Right, that's exactly who it is.
Speaker 2: She is now a--she is really a very together young lady, she is now the head of the--some kind of women's sports foundation, and she's doing really good things and she's been on Broadway, she's very diverse.  I don't know what her degree, she's graduated from college [University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland].  I don't know what her degree is, but she is doing some communications work and all of that.  She's a very great role model, a very great role model.  One of the first black role models in gymnastics was Dianne Durham.  I don't know if you are familiar with her.  She grew up in Gary, Indiana and for--I know her pretty well because for a long time she and I were the only black people we ever saw at gymnastics meets, and so it was like you know you always found somebody else that looked like you.  I was grown, she was a kid, she was about twelve, and Ebony Jr.! did an article about her when she was about maybe between nine and twelve years old.  So I knew who she was and she knew who I was.  Now she has a gym in Chicago [Illinois] it's called Skyline Gymnastics, but she was, she became so good she would have been one of the first black women in the Olympics in gymnastics, but when she got injured that year that Mary Lou Retton won all the gold medals.  Dianne Durham was better than Mary Lou Retton, and she was injured and then the national association told her that she could petition in to national championships to make the Olympic team and then when it came time for that meet they told her no, you can't petition in.  So then she was eliminated and didn't even have a chance to go for it and I think she was pretty bitter for a while.  I don't blame her but cause she was--she--you know you look at what Mary Lou Retton did and you know that Dianne Durham was far better, far better and you know that she would have won that all around and it would have been spectacular, but so we use to see each other quite a bit, and then once we moved the gym out to Oak Park [Illinois], I was doing that, that was my main job.  I wasn't even involved in the schools at all.
Story_ID: 322842
Speaker 1: Let me just catch up with, we're rolling again and I was just asking you off camera about some of the other people that teach her in the city.  I know Sammy Dyer School of Dance [Sammy Dyer School of the Theatre, Chicago, Illinois] teaches some gymnastics.
Speaker 2: There was another school, Maywood--
Speaker 1: Mayfair Academy [Mayfair Academy of Fine Arts, Chicago, Illinois], yeah over on--.
Speaker 2: Mayfair Academy, they use to do that.
Speaker 1: Eighty-Seventh [Street].
Speaker 2: And then after I started my gym [Lynn Allen's Gymnastics Center, Chicago, Illinois] maybe a year or two later there was a program at Chicago State University [Chicago, Illinois] and they had a full team.  So that gave us two teams, you know in Chicago [Illinois].  Dunbar [Dunbar Vocational High School; Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] used to have a team a long time ago and theirs dropped and I believe Lane Tech [Lane Technical College Preparatory High School, Chicago, Illinois] or another school on the North Side had a team.
Speaker 1: I think Willye White [HistoryMaker Willye B. White] was teaching some gymnastics in one of the programs that she ran, you know Willye White the track star, you know she--
Speaker 2: Okay, at a school?
Speaker 1: Various places in the community, I know she's had different youth programs around the city, and--.
Speaker 2: I remember her name.  Well now, Chicago Park District has an extensive program and it's very fantastic.  They have, they committed a lot of money to having gymnastics centers all around the city, but see it's not a traditional black sport and so it's kind of hard to get kids to understand how much work it is, how rewarding it is.  So, they committed to I think seventeen centers around the city and nobody was coming, so now it's whittled down, I don't to how many but I know the main center is Harrison Park [Chicago, Illinois].  Well they've had gymnastics on the North Side for a long time, Potter--Porter Park [Julia Porter Park, Chicago, Illinois] I think was one that has had gymnastics probably for twenty years or twenty-five years.  Chicago Park District started maybe ten years ago, maybe more than that, but I'd say absolutely no more than twenty years ago, I mean in terms of this big push to have centers all over the place and not many black kids participated so they scaled it back, but they have an elite program at Harrison Park and then they have few other places.  Garfield Conservatory [Garfield Park Conservatory, Chicago, Illinois] has a program, I think Palmer Park [Chicago, Illinois], I think has one now.
Speaker 1: That's Roseland [Chicago, Illinois], yeah.
Speaker 2: And I don't know where else, but there are quite a few.  I was pleased because we need to have more black kids exposed to things that they don't usually--that are not traditional.
Story_ID: 322843
Speaker 1: Now are your--is your program limited to girls?
Speaker 2: No, we have boys too.
Speaker 1: Boys too, okay.
Speaker 2: We have probably close to eight hundred kids that come to our program a week.  Most of them are white, but we're always looking for you know pull black kids and Hispanic kids.
Speaker 1: Eight hundred, really?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How big a place do you have?
Speaker 2: Right now in Forest Park [Illinois] we're in fourteen thousand square feet so it's pretty big, it's a nice size room, and we have all the you know, equipment--the equipment that we need.
Speaker 1: And what is it called now?
Speaker 2: It's called Tri-Star now.
Speaker 1: Tri-Star now.
Speaker 2: Tri-Star Gymnastics [Forest Park, Illinois].
Speaker 1: And when did you start Tri-Star?
Speaker 2: Well what happened is from my gym on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois], when we moved our equipment and went through the park district, I guess you could say our, the corporation was asleep or just non-active.  We were part of the park district program, and after five years we came to a difference of opinion with the park district about how we should proceed.  We had been asking can we have more space, we have all these kids.  At that time we didn't have eight hundred, we had two hundred but we were in two community centers that didn't have a high ceiling and we wanted to have a team, and they decided they would give more space but they weren't sure they wanted us to be the ones running the program, even though they had been using my equipment.  So, the whole staff quit, we pulled my equipment and quit, and then we found another to run, to rent and so we just reincorporated, not reincorporated, we--what do you call it?  We revitalized or whatever the legal term is the old corporation and renamed it, and so we named it Tri-Star Gymnastics, so it's basically more or less the same corporation, just in a different, somewhat different format.  So, that's where we are now.
Speaker 1: And this was in what--in what year was it re--?
Speaker 2: That was in 1987.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Or '6 [1986], I think it was '87 [1987].  Let's see yeah he was born in '82 [1982].  She would have been--.
Speaker 1: And before that you just called it Lynn Allen's [Lynn Allen's Gymnastics Center, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, Lynn Allen's then--.
Speaker 2: Gymnastic Center, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright, so it became Tri-Star Gymnastics?  Is there a reason for the name Tri-Star?
Speaker 2: Because three of us, the three of us who were coaches left and so we were just trying to come up with a catchy name and so Tri-Star was it.
Story_ID: 322844
Speaker 1: Do you ever perform? Do the kids perform?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah we do, we compete and they perform.  We have a big gym show every year in May and we've been doing it for eighteen years, so I'm thinking I'm trying to add up those times.  I know this our nineteenth gym show coming up this May and we always have it--because we're a non-profit organization [Tri-Star Gymnastics, Forest Park, Illinois], you know we are allowed to use the schools to rent the school field house, so we always have it in May at the Oak Park River Forest High School [Oak Park and River Forest High School, Oak Park, Illinois] field house.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how many, do all the kids compete then, I mean not compete, but show (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not all of them. In a gym show yes, anybody that wants to.  It's pretty low key, it's so much fun and it's very funny because the kids will make mistakes.  We teach all the classes routines and all the kids are invited to sign up whether they're three years old or whether they're seventeen and they perform with (unclear), and we always have a theme and it always has star in it so it might be catch a rising star, or new stars on the block, or you know whatever, it always has dancing with the stars and circus of the stars and that kind of thing, and so we try to build a theme, each routine--well it doesn't actually tie together but I tie it together 'cause I'm kind of the producer and so I'll write a script that ties the music to the theme in some loose form, so it's really just an excuse to show off what they can do and have fun and the parents love it.  We usually have about two thousand people that come and watch and it's really a lot of fun.  We have kids that have--I have kids that are grown and married and have their own kids and they still come back to see the gym show because they just really enjoy it.
Story_ID: 322845
Speaker 1: That's something I'm really, really proud of, that you know, we have so many kids. What happened when we left the park district, we really left under protest, we felt that there was nothing else that we could do and the program was mostly white, but I'm black, one of my partners was black and one of the partners was white.  We didn't know if the community would support us, we just had no idea, and they did.  They--it was unbelievable and we didn't even have a place to move to, or actually we found a place but they would not let us rent unless we had a certificate of insurance.  Well we couldn't have a certificate of insurance without paying liability insurance.  We didn't have any money to do that and so we asked the parents to pay for classes upfront, and we just waited to see what they would do and they did, and that's what allowed us to keep going.  So we rented a church basement for a little while and then we found a place and we had some work--some construction work to do on Lake Street in Oak Park [Illinois] and that was our first real gym and then from there we moved into Forest Park [Illinois], and we've moved a couple of times in Forest Park, but we've been in Forest Park for the last probably thirteen or fourteen years.  We have kids coming from Chicago [Illinois], from Maywood [Illinois], from Oak Park and River Forest [Illinois], from Berwyn [Illinois], Cicero [Illinois], Riverside [Illinois], Brookfield [Illinois], just kind of all over.  I think we even have somebody coming from Elmhurst [Illinois], as far away as Elmhurst, and so it's a very diverse gym, and that's kind of my thing in college was cultural history of minorities.  That was my thing; that was the thing that I really liked and teaching at Unity [Unity Catholic High School, Chicago, Illinois], was you know teaching all those different kinds of history classes, so in Oak Park one thing about this gym is that it's very multi-cultural.  We have all kinds of different kids and our coaches, we have, I'm black, there is another black coach, we have a white coach who is Polish, a white coach who is Hungarian, we have a Mexican coach, we have a Russian coach and then all kinds of other coaches and the kids even say, "You know we have such a diverse gym," and they start talking about their heritage and it just makes everybody feel good about being there.  As a multi-culturalist, there are a few things I've had to deal with at the gym, for example one of the kids came into the gym and she said something about, "That's so gay."  I said what 'cause I never heard that before. "That's so gay."  I said what does that mean, and she said, "Oh, you know just bad." And you know now we have gay families that bring their kids to our gym.  In Oak Park, if you know anything about Oak Park, Oak Park was listed as one of the best places for gay families to live in the country.  So, I said, "Well you know," I was trying to figure out how I was going to deal with that issue and I did not want to put her on the spot so I didn't say anything to her right then, but maybe a week later cause I heard it from somebody else in the gym, and a week later I said, "You guys sit down, I need to talk to you," and I said, "It doesn't matter to me how you feel about any particular people or lifestyle, but you must show respect to all people in this gym," and I explained that there are some gay families here and we do not want anybody's feelings hurt and then I said, "You know how I feel about this as if you said, 'That's so African American,' and you meant it was bad.  How do you think I would feel?" And they got the point, they understood, and so then nobody ever said that anymore.
Speaker 2: Now what was the nationality of the person who, the ethnic group of the person who said it?
Speaker 1: She's Hungarian.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Hungarian-American, I don't know if she identifies herself as Hungarian, but I know her name is Hungarian and so you know, but she understood.  It was something, in Oak Park kids get that a little bit because Oak Park prides itself in being very diverse, even though we still have work to do, but she didn't live in Oak Park and so her mindset was very different.  It wasn't, I mean everybody says that where she's going to school, and that's one thing about Tri-Star [Tri-Star Gymnastics, Forest Park, Illinois] is that we have kids coming from every school there is, every school in Oak Park, almost every school in the surrounding suburbs, plus Chicago kids, and Maywood, you know just all over, so we become a family and interact and it really helps I think promote good human relations.  I don't know if they take it back.  I think they do because they become friends with each other and they stay friends for a long, long, long time, and so you know we've had Indian kids who are friends with Jewish kids, who are friends with you know, all kinds of kids.  So, and one thing I'm really proud of is that for the last ten years at least, even though gymnastics is not a traditional sport for black kids, we have always had at least one black girl varsity member on the team at the high school, and I'm trying to get it to be more than that, but we have at least one.  Next year we will have at least two, so I, you know, but it's, it's something.
Story_ID: 322846
Speaker 1: It does, it sounds like really a fantastic program.
Speaker 2: It is a lot of fun.  We have a different philosophy than most gyms, and that philosophy is my philosophy and that is, my whole point for the gym on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] was to make gymnastics affordable.  It is not affordable, it's a very expensive sport, and well the Chicago Park District can do it much cheaper because they're supported by taxpayers, and so that it a good situation now, even though a lot of kids aren't taking advantage of the opportunities.  More I think are, it's starting to build maybe, but in our gym in Forest Park [Illinois], the other thing that I feel very strongly about is that you should do no damage if you're a coach.  You should not damage a kid's psyche; you should not damage them psychologically.  In gymnastics we have a lot of eating disorders, and part of it is because of what coaches do.  It's easier to do things if you are small, if you're thin, but there are a lot of eating disorders in the sport and I don't want any of that.  So we don't even get into that, I have kids who are not the traditional body build for gymnastics, and one of the reasons for that, when I was coaching at Unity [Unity Catholic High School, Chicago, Illinois] we would have meets at Unity and the whole school would come out and watch these meets and the kids would get very upset because our girls always scored lower, and our girls would look better but they would score lower, and I talked to one of the judges and I know this a factor, they'd say, "Well you know she's built differently, and so it doesn't look as good."  So they were deducting for things that they shouldn't have been deducting for, and so with Tri-Star [Tri-Star Gymnastics, Forest Park, Illinois] we have bodies that are all over the chart, we have kids that are too tall, my daughter [Kiona Allen] was a gymnast, still is, she's a second year med school, she still competes in the club gymnastics at her school.  She was the president of the club of the gymnastics club at Penn [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] all through for all four years undergrad, and she's too tall to do gymnastics.
Speaker 1: How tall is she?
Speaker 2: She is 5'6".
Speaker 1: And that's supposed to be tall?
Speaker 2: That's supposed to be tall, you are supposed to be five [feet].  Some of the girls are 4'6", 4'7", 4'8", so 5'6" is very tall, and but she competed on varsity all four years through high school, and in our gym we develop gymnasts but we develop friendships, we develop good people, they don't have to give up everything in life to be a gymnast and in many gyms they do.  They are practicing six days a week, six hours a day, some of them are being home schooled so that they can get their workouts in, and we have regular kids, I give them room to play--to take piano lessons or to you know be in a dramatic production at school or whatever, so we have really good leaders and very good people and they are all different sizes and shapes and colors.  When we go to a meet we usually have the most diverse team, and things are changing a little bit now, I think, but in the past we've had the most diverse team we've had in terms of size, we don't have the cookie-cutter gymnast, we have tall thin ones, tall skinny ones, we have short kind of stocky ones.  I had a girl from--who was Mexican.  She was adopted by a white family and she's Mexican and she looks very Aztec, very Aztec cause she's kind of broad, kind of stocky, very short, and I remember going to a meet, and having a coach make fun of my girl behind her back and I went to her and I talked to her about it and then I reported it to the national association because you know--she was not a gymnastics body, she was not flexible but she was very successful and she loved the sport, and I feel anybody that likes it should be able to do it.  So we make room for kids who are non-traditional in that sport.
Speaker 1: It kind of raised an issue about, I suppose in terms of stereotypical body types for certain sports and for dance too, 'cause I've heard it said especially with in terms--when you're talking about ballet and that sort of thing, there's a stereotypical model of what a ballerina should look like based on a stereotypical prototype of a European body (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) More of a European body.
Speaker 1: But it's a prototypical European--not every European looks like that but it's based on a prototype of a European body, is that--?
Speaker 2: But part of that is that if you are small, it is easier, it's easier to do those skills and it's easier for the coach to teach them, because you have to carry these kids through things.  So if you have a kid who's 5'8", actually I had a girl who I felt was too big and I did finally tell her mom, you know what, this is not the sport for her.  She was twelve years old, she was about 5'11" and weighted about 170 pounds, and if she did something, she'd knock me over.  I would try to hold her up and she would knock me over, and she was landing heavy on her ankles and I felt she was going to hurt herself, but that's the only time, I mean you can have, you know you have bodies that are really, really too big, but it depends on what level you're doing too, but if you are small and skinny it's easier to do those skills, cause it takes so much weight to--strength-to-weight ratio, but in my gym we're not going for elite status, we're not going for the Olympics, because only a small number of kids can make the Olympics.
Story_ID: 322847
Speaker 1: I had one girl, the little girl I told you about Agina [Agina Simpkins], who was the most talented kid I'd ever coached, she almost made it and what happened her family moved to Bolingbrook [Illinois] and so I sent her to a different gym, cause she couldn't keep coming out to the South Side [Chicago, Illinois].  So I sent her to another gym and she became an elite, which is one of the top kids.  Oprah [Oprah Winfrey] actually helped her in financially, 'cause her mom was raising, she was a single mom raising three girls, four girls and she was working two full-time jobs and the tuition out there at that gym was like two thousand [dollars] a month, so I think Oprah was helping her, as long as Agina kept her grades up, and she did.  She was an A student.  She made it to the national team.  In the Olympic year she was number twenty, now I think she could have gone farther but she was so nervous I think she got dehydrated and she started having back spasms, and so she just made it through the competition by the skin of her teeth I think, but she was number twenty.  She went on to get on to get a full ride at Georgia [University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia], she was national champion on bars at Georgia for two years in a row I believe, and when Georgia was the national champion of NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association], so she was the closest and I can't say that I got her to that level, but she started with me when she was like three, and she left me when she was nine and she had taken second place on beam and she loved bars.  She'd come and at my gym when I told you I'd let her stay all day, the whole day she would work bars and she had tiny, tiny hands, but so I gave her a good start anyway so.
Speaker 2: So how do you spell her first name?
Speaker 1: Agina, A-G-I-N-A.
Speaker 2: Okay, and Simpkins, okay.
Speaker 1: She's a Chicago [Illinois] kid.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, now she's coaching in Nashville [Tennessee], no Atlanta [Georgia], I think she's in Atlanta still and she has a couple of kids, so but she had a perfect gymnastics body, but she had a growth problem.  They had to give her a shot when she was two to get her growing again, so she was always going to be tiny.  So you know she had an advantage over somebody who was a normal height, you know, even 5'5" is tall for a gymnast but in our gym, we're after something else; we're not after national championships.  I feel you know, you depend too much on politics, what year you were born, luck, staying injury free, and only six make it every four years.  That's--I mean the odds are against you for doing that, so I feel anybody that wants to do it should be able to enjoy it and get satisfaction out of competing, but at a different level.  So we don't go for the highest levels.  We challenge the kids, let them go as high as they wanna go and they have fun with it.
Story_ID: 322848
Speaker 1: (Cough).
Speaker 2: What do you think is the most satisfying thing about gymnastics in terms, I mean why do people--are so many kids involved in gymnastics these days?
Speaker 1: It is hard, you have to work hard, you have to be strong, and so you have to work at it.  One thing that it does for kids, for students, it helps them become more self-disciplined, because in order to be good at it, you have to keep practicing and you can't give up, and if you can't get it then you have to figure out with your coach why you're not getting it, and then do something about it.  You can always do something about it or almost always, and then if you wanna be good you have to practice so many days which means you have to self-discipline yourself to get your homework done, to get all your studying done.  So you'll find that many of the good gymnasts are very good students because they learn how to manage their time and that's probably the biggest thing, but you know, flipping is just one of those things.  You know kids just naturally do it.  They bounce on the bed, they flip on the bed and so I say come learn how to do it safely, and to have some fun with it and be with other people who are doing it and you can have fun with it and there are so many different avenues, you know the Jesse White Tumblers do it, the park districts to it, YMCAs [Young Men's Christian Association] do it, it's just, it's a really satisfying thing.  I know when I competed it took me two years to get a split (laughter).  Right now it's the only thing I can still do, but it was just something that I wanted to do and I just kept at it, and I think it's good for you physically, I think it's the basics for all sports for all body movement because you're flexible, you're strong, you're aware of what your body is doing.
Speaker 2: Yeah you mentioned [HistoryMaker] Jesse White and yeah, that seems to be the persona of the Jesse White Tumblers, yeah they do, I think he started in, was it Cabrini?
Speaker 1: I think it was.
Speaker 2: Cabrini Green Housing Projects [Cabrini-Green Homes, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: To get kids off the street, yes.
Speaker 2: And brought them in and it seems to be more than just the fact that they can do gymnastics, it seems like the discipline involved and he's got them focusing up on something that--
Speaker 1: Right, productive and positive, and they perform all over the place.
Speaker 2: Right, right, he's now the secretary of state too.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: For the State of Illinois which is (laughter) shows some discipline on his part I suppose (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, it does, but I mean and he was always into politics even then, because I you know, I don't know how--I know he was involved with the directly for quite a while, but I think he was still, he was in politics.  I think he was like a committeeman or an alderman or something all along, and I just admire him for that because he's showing that he cares about the kids in the community by putting something in the community that will draw--those are all--most of them are boys and they're like between what fifteen and twenty-two, something like that, that's prime age to be drawn in the gangs and things like that so you know I really admire what he has done with those guys because they're doing something positive and they have skills that a lot of people will never have, not even come close to, so I think that's such a positive thing.  I try to do that in terms of my program, it is a community service, and one thing I can say, I've been coaching for so long that, well I'm not working exclusively with black kids anymore and it's mostly white kids, but I feel like I'm contributing in a different way because white kids get to know a black person that is not the stereotype on television and I've had parents come and tell me, you know their kids wrote a story about me at school, or their kids wrote you know a letter about me or something like that, as a role model that they admire and it's strange to me.  I had a kid who lives in Berwyn [Illinois], now Berwyn ten to fifteen years ago was a pretty racist town, and this little girl wrote a story about me in school as her gymnastics coach and I just thought, you know you have so much influence when you work with kids, you have to be really careful that you don't let them down you know and I've always tried to be aware that I could let somebody down, try never to do it in a way you know, I mean I'm not perfect so I may lose my temper, but I usually don't.
Story_ID: 322849
Speaker 1: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now have you ever had a scary moment?  In gymnastics it seems like sometimes when you watch, those of use that have no training whatsoever look at it as if it's magic and how in the world do people keep from hurting themselves?
Speaker 1: They do get hurt, I had, the scariest moment I have ever had was a kid, I was working with her on a back summersault, a back flip in the air with no hands, and she ran and she did a round off back-hand spring.  I don't know if you know what those are, but those are skills that lead up to it and then the back flip, and as she went up for the back flip she changed her mind, now I was spotting her, she changed her mind.  Well I'm already initiating the flip; she's coming down, trying to come down, so then I start letting her come down and then she flips it anyway, and I caught her by her clothes and caught her she was about this far from the floor, landing on her head which could have been a broken neck, and it just really scared me, you know, but I mean that's those are things that happen.  Usually the coaches get hurt, not the kids, (laughter) cause we're trying--we do everything we can to keep the kids from getting hurt.  Sometimes I've had a tooth chipped, I've had--a coach had her nose broken which required extensive plastic surgery, you know, things like that happen.  The scariest thing that has happened to someone I know was a student at UIC [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  I coached briefly at UIC, I was one of the assistant coaches, and after my stint there one of the girls on my team went into UIC and was bouncing on the trampoline, she was doing back flips and she shouldn't have been on the tramp by herself, but she was there and she fell, hit the frame and hit the floor and broke her neck, and she--they had to do a tracheotomy, she was paralyzed from the neck down, she was nineteen years old, and she lived for about three months and then she died and that was, that gives you pause, I--whenever I see these backyard trampolines, I just do not like them 'cause kids, you can see it in their eyes, it's, it would be so easy to flip, you can just see it, and I've even said that I've had kids on trampoline and I see that look in their eyes and I say, "Don't you dare," I just know it.
Story_ID: 322850
Speaker 1: Well tell us about multicultural education, and you're the multicultural education specialist for the grade school [sic. Oak Park Elementary School District 97, Oak Park, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: I'm the director of the department (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) the director, okay.
Speaker 2: We have--in Oak Park [Illinois] we have a multicultural education department.  It is part of our elementary school system, our district supports it, and I'm the director of that department.
Speaker 1: Now when did you start doing that, I mean you 'cause you were--you said for a long time you didn't teach--.
Speaker 2: Right, well what happened is when I had my kids I was still coaching at the gym with Tri-Star [Tri-Star Gymnastics, Chicago, Illinois] and I started, I'm a political person.  I've always been pretty political and so I became involved in some of the political issues in the village and I served on a committee, it was a strategic planning committee for District 97 and I also was volunteering in the schools.  I was always in school helping with you know reading or helping with something while my kids were going through, and I became involved with the strategic--I also took training when they were working on school improvement plans.  I took training as a parent representative 'cause I was one of the main parent volunteers in the school at the time, so I went through this training which made me one of the parent leaders, and then I served on the strategic planning committee which worked on diversity issues.  Now Oak Park has had for twenty-five, twenty-six years what was called a Multicultural Resource Center and it was like a library and like a museum; or--not so much like a museum until recently, but it was like a library and what happened is they made curriculum guides on diversity, you know teaching about Native American Indians, teaching--you know there's an African American curriculum guide for teachers to use.  There's a Rainbows of Understanding [ph.] curriculum guide, there's a Hispanic Latino curriculum guide for teachers to use to bring diversity into the classroom, and that's been going on for a long time. They also made things like they would make, just maybe clothing or you know African-type clothing and that kind of stuff and it would be a resource teachers could come in and check it out and use it in their classrooms.  Well, in 1990 the strategic planning committee recommended that the resource center become a department, not just a library but become a department and that it would be involved in things like staff development, hiring, curriculum, textbook selection, all those kinds of things, and I had served on a committee for the Multicultural Resource Center called the Multicultural Advocates, we called them the MAC and what we would do, these were community members who were interested in diversity issues and we would advise the director or the director of the resource center, and some of the issues that we dealt with were things like the religion policy in schools.
Story_ID: 322851
Speaker 1: There were--one of the issues we dealt with was, there were some murals that were put up during World War II [WWII] that were commissioned by Franklin Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] and the Civilian Conservation Corps or whatever, you know the artwork.
Speaker 2: WPA [Works Progress Administration] probably, yeah.
Speaker 1: And one of the--one of these huge murals had a horrible depiction of black people, you know, the pickaninny hair, and you know the big red lips and all you could see was white eyes and that kind of stuff, and some parents started complaining about that so they wanted it taken down and I wanted it taken down, but there were people who were saying, look, that's history, that's historical.  We need to--you know we just can't destroy art from another time period.  So our committee the MAC [Multicultural Advocates] was given the charge by the board to come up with what to do, and I said burn the thing (laughter) and other people were very upset about it so what we did was we created a curriculum unit, about murals and so we took the mural down and put it in this kit, which to this day nobody's used but the people who didn't want art to be destroyed are satisfied it wasn't destroyed, but it's not up in the school.  So anyway I had been involved with the MAC and when the--and then on the strategic planning committee and I knew exactly what we had in mind when we said it should be a department, and then I was on the--
Speaker 2: Well, let's go back a little bit to this mural.  I remember that was a big flap about that.  It made the news, local news, and even made the national news I believe.
Speaker 1: I think it did.
Speaker 2: I believe it did. Yeah, and I heard about it from a lot of people and, so the resolution was of this mural was that it was taken down actually (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Taken down and--
Speaker 2: Is it, well where is it now?
Speaker 1: Well, it's in a kit that people can borrow, if they want to, about murals.
Speaker 2: No, but where is the actual mural?
Speaker 1: The mural is in a kit.  I think it's rolled, it's rolled up, I believe--
Speaker 2: Oh, the actual mural?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: It's in a kit that people can borrow?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, I thought the kit had a reproduction of it or something like that.
Speaker 1: No, no the actual mural is in this kit and they have--they have photographs of it too, but there are lot of things about how--what the process was about taking it down and then what the historical significance of it is and what it means to different kinds of people and then the history of murals and what murals are all about and all that kind of stuff.  So it was preserved, course nobody's borrowed it so (laughter), I don't care about as long as it wasn't still up in the building.
Speaker 2: So it's not there--how big is it?
Speaker 1: It's probably about the size of this wall from the corner to here, but it's not as tall as that.
Speaker 2: Maybe ten, ten by, ten by four or something maybe like that?
Speaker 1: Probably something like that.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right. Ten by five (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It might not be quite as big, but it's, I think if I remember 'cause I saw it, I think it's about that.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 322852
Speaker 1: Once it became a department [Department of Multicultural Education], I served also on the interview committee for the first director and when they hired the first director, who was my predecessor, I started volunteering at the Center [Multicultural Resource Center], partly because I felt there were people who had a certain agenda, who were serving on some of these committees and I didn't want them to have a primary say in how--the direction of the department, and so I started volunteering and then after a couple of years the director put me on as a part-timer, and so I worked there for her for about ten years and then when she announced--or about eight years, and then when she announced that she was going to retire, I decided nobody knows this department better than I do and that's my field, history, so I decided to go back and get my master's [degree] in administration so that I would be qualified for the job and then I went after it so when she retired, it took a long time because they had so many other issues to deal with, but I was hired in November of 2003, so I've been the director since then.
Speaker 2: Okay, so how's it been, is it a real challenge (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It is a challenge--
Speaker 2: Oak Park [Illinois] is considered one of the most liberal places in--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --in the Chicago [Illinois] area.
Speaker 1: And it is, and you know one thing about Oak Park that I really like, it's interesting kids--'cause I work with so many kids. I've worked with kids who end up being basketball and football players, but I had them when they were four, they were little squirrely boys you know bouncing around, but a lot of times kids come back to see us and they always say, "Boy I thought Oak Park was a dump until I went to University of Illinois.  Those people are hicks; they've never seen a black person in real life, and they don't know anything, and they are prejudiced."  My daughter [Kiona Allen] went to the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and she was talking--see in Oak Park you have everything.  We have you know, we have militant gays and we have reasonable people you know who are gay.  We have militant Jewish people and we have reasonable people who are Jewish.  We have militant African Americans and we have reasonable people who are African American, so we you know we have extremes of all kinds, but we have all kinds of people and we all try to talk to each other and we do say diversity is important in our community. Now, we don't always do it perfectly, but when I look at what's out there everywhere else, I think we do it better than almost everybody else but we still have work to do, and the kids come back talking about their experiences at college, and how people are coming from other places, they're so narrow minded.  My daughter said the same thing, one of her friends is a gymnast who is gay, and he is very obviously gay, and people, she said students would say, "How can you be friends with him," and she was like, "What, he's a nice guy, you know he's friendly, he's nice, what, what," and they were like, "Oh, you know they're so immoral, and blah, blah, blah."  She was like, "I don't care about, I'm not looking at that aspect of a human being.  I'm looking at he's a human being and he's worthy of respect and he's nice, and that's what I'm looking at."  In Oak Park, that's kind of what we're trying to get to.  Everybody isn't there, but we are trying to get at it.
Story_ID: 322853
Speaker 1: Now one challenge for me and my department [Department of Multicultural Education] is that there are people who don't realize that they are biased, and see we've gone beyond the surface stuff.  Now we have to get into another level of conversation about race and people don't want to do it.  It's not comfortable.  People, you know don't want to understand that the school culture is not a white middle class culture, it is a hybrid of all of us who have contributed to it, and so when teachers, when I say to a group of teachers, "You need to understand that generally"--over generalizing now--"that black families communicate with their children differently than white families do," so if your teacher, if the teacher says, "Charlie, do you want to sit down?"  If Charlie's white he understands that means sit down, if Charlie is black he thinks he has a choice, because when black families talk to their kids they either give them a directive, a declarative, sit down, or if you have a--if I give you a choice you really have a choice, but white families tend to talk more indirectly.  So, do you wanna come and eat?  That means come on and eat.  If I tell my son, "You wanna come and eat," he'll say, "Yeah, I'll come down in a little bit," and then he comes down an hour later, so you know when a teacher says, "I told him to sit down, and he didn't sit down."  Did you really say, "Sit down," he's getting in trouble, did you tell him to sit down or did you ask him if he wanted to, or did you make a suggestion?  So those are things that I try to get across to the teachers that the conversation is different and you have to understand, but then I'll have a teacher say, "Well you know they have to learn how we communicate so that they can do well."  Well, no, you need to learn how to communicate better with him and he has to learn how to better communicate with you.  It's a two-way street, it's not a one way street, you know.  One of the things I talked about with the superintendent, we have a new superintendent this year and she's African American, she's awesome, but the last superintendent was good too, and I talked to him about how too many African American children are not involved in afterschool--extracurricular activities, and that there are certain--all kinds are welcome to participate in all these activities, but there are certain activities that you know black kids are not going to participate in.  They're not going to participate in field hockey, it's too foreign, and they're not going to participate in hockey, they're gonna participate in the traditional black activities, but the schools can help bridge that gap by offering some activities that we know black kids like to do.  So one of the things I'm working on is double-dutch teams.  Everybody's welcome, but we know that we'll draw in more black girls who are the most physically unfit, the least active, the least involved in school activities and have negative attitudes.  So if we can pull them into double-dutch teams, have them competing, Chicago [Illinois] has competition, you know, we just don't--so trying to organize that, but then we have a problem with gym teachers who don't know how to teach double-dutch.  They don't know how to jump it, they don't know how to teach it so, now trying to find people who know how to do it so we can have teams.  So we're organizing that now, but it's the subtle things that people don't realize.  Those are where the problems are now.  We--it's interesting with Hurricane Katrina, I saw--my daughter [Kiona Allen] actually emailed me two pictures, you probably have seen them, one is of a black man, he's in waist-deep water and he has a loaf of bread, and the headline says, "Looting," you know something about him looting.  The other picture shows two white people in waist-deep water with a loaf of bread and it says they're finding food.
Speaker 2: Foraging, yes.
Speaker 1: So I sent that to all of the teachers in the district [Oak Park Elementary School District 97, Oak Park, Illinois], and said, "Look, what's wrong with these pictures?" you know and you know it's kind of--I got some comments back.  Most of them said this is just outrageous you know, they caught it right away, but a couple of people said, "Well, you know, you don't know what the circumstance was." You know and started making excuses, and so I try to just raise their awareness of things like that by sending emails out to teachers.  I do a newsletter that has information about different cultures.  September 15th to October 15th is Hispanic-Latino Heritage Month.  Let's see, October is Polish, German, Italian Heritage Month and also Diversity Awareness Month, and so and Gay and Lesbian Heritage Month.  So I try to put those out and we have a calendar where people can go to our website and they can look at the calendar and it has all these different holidays and events, historical events and birthdays of people from around the world, and they can click on it and find out more about that person or about that historical event, so I'm trying to help people become more culturally competent and to be more culturally aware, more culturally sensitive to differences.
Story_ID: 322854
Speaker 1: You know sometimes you have problems between teachers and parents, and it's sometimes it's really more communication style than anything.  Teachers feel they are being attacked or they're being intimidated when--and I say, you know, I think generally black people talk louder than white people.  I know I do, and use their hands more and are you know more expressive and sometimes--I was sitting in a meeting with a principal and a parent, and the principal was backing up like this, and I was just really engaged with the mom.  I knew she wasn't--she wasn't trying to be intimidating at all, she just, that's the way she was and he wasn't familiar with that conversation style, and so trying to help them become more aware of the differences that are not major differences, that we can bridge these gaps, we just have to be aware.  I had to do an intervention with two teachers who one was black, one was white.  The white teacher was the head of the department and there were things that she was saying or doing that really were her conversation style; he was taking as racist, and so I just talked through it with them and I said well you need to understand that this is the way he sees what you're doing when you say it like this, you know just cut it off or no, "Hi, how are you Mr. So-and-So," you know just, "Did you such-and-such a thing" you know, just get right into the business of it.  I said, "You know conversation styles are pretty different.  Many times blacks start out more casually because it's friendlier, whereas formal is unfriendly.  I know that's the way I feel and a lot of people feel that way.  If you are very formal and you don't use the little courtesies, it's putting him off." And then to him, "Do you understand that that's really just the way, she talks to everybody like that.  So it's not you, it's not necessarily race, and she talks to white people and black people that way, male and female that way. She's gonna try to adjust her style a little bit recognizing that that's the way you feel when she talks to you that way and then you can give her a little bit of slack, understanding that that's the way she is."  So I have to do some mediation sometimes, mediation between parents and the school, trying to help teachers be more sensitive to kids' situations.
Story_ID: 322855
Speaker 1: And then another part of my job is minority student achievement and trying to help the district [Oak Park Elementary School District 97, Oak Park, Illinois] bridge the gap, because--now were in the Minority Student Achievement Network, which is a national network of twenty-five schools and all of these schools are schools like Oak Park [Illinois], they're high--relatively decent income, high achieving schools and there's a gap between black and white students, and most of these kids didn't move in from Chicago [Illinois], they grew up in Oak Park.  What is the difference?  So trying to get at why is there a gap.  Now, my daughter [Kiona Allen], there wasn't a gap for her, she was fine, she was way up there academically and you know really high test scorer, you know test taker and my son [Kyle Allen] was okay, although his grades weren't that great, but we have a gap in knowledge and proficiency, skill proficiency, so we've been looking at what can we do, what's happening, what are the differences, and so I'm trying to do things that will help that.  One of them is telling parents, "You need to have your kids in activities; they need to be in activities."  By the time they get to the high school they have no skills, so how are they gonna go out for tennis, when you didn't start playing tennis until you were I seventh grade, and those kids started when they were five years old.  In gymnastics, kids are starting at two and three years old.  You start in seventh grade, there's only so much we can do unless you really are a phenomenal athletic, playing chess or any of these things.  White families put their kids into a lot of things, they have them in piano lessons, violin lessons, they take foreign language, they are in Hebrew school, they're in Korean school, they're in ballet classes, they're in gymnastics, they're you know doing all these things and black families tend not to, and so that was one of my fights on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois], we--with my team I had kids who would take the bus to the gym, and have to take the bus home at night by themselves.  Their parents wouldn't come and pick them up, I had a girl who lived in Calumet City, or Calumet Park is that--is it Calumet Park?
Speaker 2: There's a Calumet City [Illinois] too, but there's a Calumet Park [Illinois] too.
Speaker 1: Okay, whichever one is like 127th [Street] and Parnell [Avenue], in that area--.
Speaker 2: That's Calumet Park.
Speaker 1: And this little girl was ten years old.  She was ten years old she would have to take the Cottage Grove [Avenue] bus to 79th Street, 79th Street to the Dan Ryan [Dan Ryan Expressway] "L", the Dan Ryan "L" to 95th [Street] and then take a bus home.  She's ten years old and it's nine o'clock at night, and people would feel--I'd feel sorry for her so I'd take her home.  Now I lived in Oak Park, Calumet City is the opposite direction.  It would make me take two hours to get home and I would get to her house, and her dad's car would be in the driveway.  She was the next to youngest of twelve kids in the family; she had brothers and sisters who could have driven her home.  Nobody would bother, and when I got mad about it and talked to the family about it, what they did, their answer to this problem was to have her younger sister come with her so then they could take the bus together, and that was, you know that was something that was very hard for me.  It happened a lot, not just with that family, but a lot of families, and out here in Oak Park parents drive their kids everywhere, so trying to help parents, African American parents understand you want their kids to be as successful, you have to do some of the same kinds of things, and that means that we may need to look at how we spend, because many times we say that we don't have the money, but we do.  We just have to look at what our priorities are and how we're gonna spend it so, one of my jobs is that I'm trying to do is connect with parents and help them understand how important putting your kids in these things is to their future, you know, they're exposed to a lot.
Story_ID: 322856
Speaker 1: I think you've addressed it on some level already, but we always ask this question and that's what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well in Oak Park [Illinois] I want our parents to feel like they really part of the school.  They still feel so many, not everybody, but too many feel that they really are not welcome and so they're hesitant to come in and become involved.  Some may be intimidated because of their educational level or just feel like it's a big clique cause all those white people bowl together during the day cause they aren't working some of them, and so I want our black parents to feel like they're really a part of the school system and that they can be involved and plan and that it's not really an adversarial relationship, that you know sometimes we tend to wait until something has been planned and then we don't like it and then we complain about it, and I'm saying, come and plan, put, give your input, shape the activity so it is the shape you want it to be in and you have a stake in it, and I think really, the bottom line is I think the community really does want that.  Sometimes they don't go about communicating that to others very well, you know and sometimes some people don't want it, you know there's gonna be racism and bias everywhere, and there are also some black families that try to use race as leverage. So they're--people are afraid to say something because they're afraid they're gonna be called racist, and sometimes that's not what the issue is, you know sometimes it is, yes, sometimes it's not and sometimes people just need to say what they wanna say without being fearful of being called a name so that you can address it.  You can't address an issue or thoughts or opinions if you don't know what they are.  So I want open communication where people can say what they wanna say, I want black families to feel like they're part of it.  I want the black children to--what I'm worried about is we have so many black children who are so talented, and they don't even know what they're talented in because they won't consider anything that's quote, non-traditional.  If it's not track, its basketball, it's not football and it's not cheerleading, they aren't gonna do it and we have kids, I know we have some violinists out there, I know we have musicians.  When I was growing up we had all those bands in Chatham [Chicago, Illinois], I can't even--the Five Stairsteps came from that area.  I don't want to say [HistoryMaker] Ramsey Lewis, but there was somebody else, either Kool and the Gang or Ramsey Lewis that weren't that far from us, and all these bands played in their garages.  You don't see that with black kids doing that anymore.  They were always doing that stuff and they performed at sock hops and all that kind of stuff, it kept them out of trouble.  We aren't doing that, and we have so many people who could be talented.
Story_ID: 322857
Speaker 1: I wanna see us reach our full potential and I'm frustrated with the media images that we get, I want to see more black people in a lot of different things so that we can show kids you know, you can do anything, don't limit yourself, you can be--you know I have a gymnast at my gym who was trying to pick floor music.  The only music she would listen to was hip-hop, now gymnastics is not a good venue for hip-hop music even if it has no singing, you know 'cause you can't use singing with floor music in gymnastics.  She wouldn't listen to anything else and I'm thinking you know, this would be great music for you, you know, this is your--this would suit your style, you know the way you move and all of this, but she would only consider hip-hop, and I think it's limiting, our kids are limiting their future options by refusing to try things, and when you look at white kids, they try everything.  Their parents make them be in a sport or an activity.  You know I have friend who makes--he made his daughter play soccer, and when soccer was over he said, "Okay now what are you gonna do?" 'Cause she was in something after school all year, and in the summer and at our gym [Tri-Star Gymnastics, Forest Park, Illinois] we had some Olympians come. We've have, one of our gymnasts was an Olympian in another sport, she was in luge, and she came back and she called after the Olympics, she came in fourth in the luge and she said, "Can I come back and take class?"  I said, sure, you know.  She said, "Well I'm bigger now and you know I'm not so flexible anymore."  I said, "Yeah, fine, come." I said, "The only thing though is I want you to wear your jacket and your beanie and talk to the kids a little about your Olympic experience."  So she did and one of the things that keeps coming out especially for girls, if they're active in a sport, they don't have time for boys.  They don't have time and if they do, it's like, I'm not serious. And statics show that girls who are in sports are much less likely to get pregnant, much less likely to use drugs, much less likely to drop out of school and they have better grades, and our girls are not getting involved in sports like they should you know.  Girls, everybody likes to play, and so you know our girls, when I see the girls in  Oak Park [Illinois] too many of them, they are overweight, they're not active, and even in sixth and seventh grade their whole lives, their lives are revolving around sixth and seventh grade boys.  How can they do that?  We've had sixth grade girls who were pregnant. I'm sure that's all over the place, but I mean we're in a--I consider us to be in a crisis stage for our African American kids, girls and boys.  The boys are all being referred to special ed [special education] and to me special ed is a shortcut to jail, unless we can get them out of it and then girls are boy crazy and they don't have any options, they just stay and they watch the boys play basketball, but they aren't doing anything.  They're just sitting and watching, they're not engaged.  They're overweight, they're not healthy and they're not happy, and I just, I guess for me--okay.
Speaker 2: Finish your sentence.
Speaker 1: I say I would like to see the achievement gap gone from Oak Park gone in five years and full engagement.
Story_ID: 322858
Speaker 1: Tell me now when you look back at everything you've done up to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: You know I've thought about that a lot and I don't think there is anything I would do differently because you know I can think when you get divorced you sometimes think, should I have married that person?  Well I wouldn't have my kids [Kiona Allen and Kyle Allen], I wouldn't be in Oak Park [Illinois], I would not you know so much would change if I hadn't married the person I married.  I think it's been a great journey.  There are things I wish hadn't happened, but in terms of what I would do differently, I don't think I'd do anything differently, maybe be a little more organized in the job I'm in right now, but I mean that's a work in progress, but I can't think of anything that I wouldn't repeat.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I don't want any changes (laughter).
Story_ID: 322859
Speaker 1: At this juncture in your life when you look back at what you've done what would you consider today to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well I'd like to think that the gym [Tri-Star Gymnastics, Forest Park, Illinois] will be one big part of it, that we've touched so many lives and one of the things that I'm really proud of with this gym is that we have such a diverse group of kids who work together on my team and they all have become life-long friends and kids keep coming back, they're grown and they keep coming back to see us.  They have a love of the sport that they have because of what we did, because of the way we did it was different from many other gyms.  We have kids that stayed much longer than other gyms because we don't put that kind of pressure on them to have a certain body and we don't have eating disorders and that kind of thing, and well I don't have kids that are going off to big NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] gymnastics teams, I have kids that love it so much they don't want to quit when they go to college, and they get on college team clubs and they compete in college clubs, that's what my daughter [Kiona Allen] did through undergrad.  She competed last year while she was in med school, because it's a different kind of pressure, it gives you room to be a real student and still do your sport and have fun with it.  So, I'd like to think that having touched a lot of lives in a positive way that didn't do damage to, you know, their self-esteem and where they still love the sport and they are putting their kids into sports.
Story_ID: 322860
Speaker 1: And I'm hoping for with the Multicultural Center [Multicultural Resource Center] that I can get these things accomplished that I want, that we will pull together as a community on a different level than we have seen in this country.  We're not there yet, I think we're far better than most places but we still have a lot of work to do and we're in a cross-roads right now I think, Oak Park [Illinois] is because the housing stock is very expensive, taxes are very high.  We're losing our economic and racial diversity to some extent because people can't afford to move in and there are people who are saying, "We're losing this, white and black, we're losing our diversity, we do not want this to happen." And so people are taking steps to stop this proliferation of these expensive condos and the density of, you know, eighty units in a place where you know, ten units were before, and trying to you know keep the flow of black families.  We don't have a significant, a really significant Hispanic-Latino population in Oak Park, but that's gonna change, we know it will, but--unless the prices are so high that moderate income people can't afford to live there.  So I'm hoping that we will get to a different level that no one has gotten to before, and they've led the way on a lot of things.  Oak Park started with diversity assurance, equity assurance back in the '70s [1970s] which stopped block busting.  When Austin [Chicago, Illinois] went black, everybody said Oak Park's gonna be black, but they came up with equity assurance which was like an insurance policy that guaranteed that you're property values would not, you would not lose your property values.  So then it calmed people down you know, people can't move in if you don't move out folks you know.  So those people that we call doopers: dear old Oak Parkers moved out.  They are the ones that didn't want any diversity.  They didn't want us coming in.  When I first moved to Oak Park thirty-one years ago, somebody tried to set our house on fire, and you know it was somebody stupid but because they didn't know how to burn a fire, but I saw newspapers packed all the way around the house and somebody lit the top layer and it didn't burn, and I had you know some incidents with police officers and people doing things, we had things thrown through our front window and stuff like that, not like Percy Julian did when he moved in there, you know his house was fire bombed.
Speaker 2: Percy Julian lived in Oak Park?
Speaker 1: He lived in Oak Park and--.
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Carl Spight lives there now a physicist, another scientist yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Um-hm. But you know we all have had some degree of problems if you've been here that long, but it is just a lot better, but we still have work to do.  We have a lot of work to do and I'm hoping that we can get it done in five years.  I said five years, I don't know why, I think 'cause I don't want to be sixty and still have all this stuff happening so I have a little bit of time.
Story_ID: 322861
Speaker 1: Well tell us about your family.  Now you have two children, I mean they're grown basically now. (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes.  My daughter Kiona [Kiona Allen] is twenty-three and she is a second-year med student at the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], and she's very political, our conversations--my son is Kyle [Kyle Allen] and he is twenty.
Speaker 1: Now, how do you spell their names?
Speaker 2: Kiona is K-I-O-N-A and Kyle is K-Y-L-E, and we have some great conversations.  They're very, very intelligent kids and very politically aware and when we have conversations, it's just mind blowing.  We had a conversation in a restaurant and somebody came up and said, "I have never heard teenagers talk about stuff like that," because it's just really deep.  We were talking about whether we should go--the war in Iraq [Iraq War], you know into Iraq.  We talk about you know racism here or you know forces there that affect people, and just all kinds of things, and so she is very politically active at Penn, not very politically active, but she's one of the few black med students there and she--we were just having a conversation where she was complaining that they didn't have enough black students in the new first year class in med school, and they're on the recruiter's case about it.  She said Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] had more than we did and that's not right, we need more than that, and my son is very aware, he, sometimes his thought processes give me a headache because he is so complicated and deep and sometimes you know I'll have somebody read his writing and they'll say, "Who thinks like that," because he's really very interesting, but he is writing a book.  Actually, he's written about three books, but this book he says he wants to try to try to have published.
Speaker 1: Now he's, how old is he?
Speaker 2: He's twenty.
Speaker 1: Twenty
Speaker 2: Yes, and he, he has gone the hard route, where Kiona went through school she was always an A student and always very popular cause she's gifted with people.  Kyle is not, he's very smart but he is not gifted with people and he didn't have a lot of friends, and so he's gone through some changes.  When he was in fourth grade, I pulled him out of school and home schooled him for the second half of fourth grade cause he just, it was too hard for him, and yet I could see how smart he was, but he gets into these modes, he's a science fanatic.  So all through elementary school all he cared about was science and the cell and all of this and one of the reasons that I pulled him out of school was that he had a teacher who was black, but she, he may have rubbed her the wrong way or whatever, and I'll never forget him coming home and he was so proud because his teacher had apologized to him, and I said, "What did she apologize to you for?"  And he said, "Well you know, she was talking about the three states of matter, and a solid, liquid and a gas and I asked what is fire, and she made it seem it like--," you know the kids laughed at him, and I, you know from his conversation, he didn't see anything wrong with this, but I was getting angrier and angrier, because she let the class laugh at him and call him stupid.  She didn't know the answer, and but then she came back after school and apologized to him and said, "Well you know there are four states of matter.  The fourth state is plasma and that's what fire is.  That was a good question." But she didn't say that in front of the class, so they continued to think he was stupid, and so he was so proud because she recognized that he had said something right, and I was fuming mad and so some things like that happened in fourth grade, and he was getting depressed and didn't like to go to school and he was talking about you know, why am I alive, and I was like, "Oh no this is not going to happen to this child," and I pulled him out school and home schooled him, and if I had more confidence in myself I would have home schooled him for the rest of elementary school, and I think he would have done better in high school, but I just, I kept feeling like he needed to be with other kids.
Story_ID: 322862
Speaker 1: Later when I went back to school to get my master's [degree] for this job, the multicultural job [director of multicultural education, Oak Park Elementary School District 97, Oak Park, Illinois], I was doing my internship and I started reading about some of the disorders that kids have in special education, and identified one that I thought my son [Kyle Allen] had which was Asperger's syndrome which is, my son just met it to a tee, but when I finally got him tested it wasn't Asperger's but it was something similar, it was a non-verbal learning disability and they said his IQ was off the charts and they felt that was why he wasn't getting along with the other kids, because I knew, I always knew he had a huge vocabulary and it's very scientific and see if you look at 'Star Trek' that's gonna expand your vocabulary anyway, but they just said he--kids didn't know what he was talking about.  He was always talking, he was very verbal but they didn't know what he was talking about, and he would go into detail on nuclear submarines and that kind of stuff so, but both of them are very intelligent.  He's at DeVry University right now, he just started his second year, and she [Allen's daughter, Kiona Allen] is starting her second year in med school, so I'm very proud of them.  They both are very good kids, they are very nice kids and very smart kids.  They are very kind to other people and they're very socially aware, politically aware.  I want them to feel that they need to give something back to the community and Kiona has.  She went to Guatemala during spring break to work in an AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] clinic and medical clinic inoculating kids against I think yellow fever in Guatemala and she wants to go back.  Kyle hasn't gotten into anything like that yet, but he's very socially and politically aware and it's interesting having conversations with him about religion and philosophy and all that kind of stuff.  So I have great plans for my kids and I keep them on my prayer list because you know, you always have to do that, but they're doing very well.
Story_ID: 322863
Speaker 1: Now is there anything that we have not asked you about that we should address before I ask my last question.
Speaker 2: Okay, do you ask about siblings at all?
Speaker 1: Well we can talk about them, we certainly can, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well my brothers, I have three brothers.  I was the oldest, I'm the boss of the kids and the oldest grandchild in the family, but I have a brother Rick [Richard Stephenson III] who is a doctor, I have a brother George [George Stephenson], we call him Tommy who is a judge in Minnesota, and I have a brother Dave [Harold Stephenson] who is a cameraman and he is working on trying to break into the Hollywood scene or whatever the scene is for a camera, you know filming movie industry.
Speaker 1: Is he in California?
Speaker 2: No, he's here, but he's worked on some small, you know he's worked had small things to do on like 'Barbershop' and some other movies, nothing really major right now but I'm hoping cause he feels you know, it's hard to live up to our family when you have a father [Richard Stephenson, Jr.] who was you know, all this in education and then he has a brother who is a doctor, a lawyer all this and then he's a cameraman, sometimes it's hard you know, he feels like he's not living up to the family standard in terms of education and that kind of thing, but I really, I admire all my brothers. They're good people, they accept their responsibilities and you know they work very hard on you know kids, and everything else, we all--all of us have kids, kids are doing well and not using drugs, not in gangs or anything like that.  I think the youngest child in our family of my nephews and nieces is eight.  So they range from eight all the way to my daughter [Kiona Allen], who's twenty-three, and we have family, family is very close and it's nice to get together.  Actually, we were all together this past weekend, not our kids but my brothers and I and my mother [Ruby Jordan Stephenson] and father and so it's a very strong family which is something that all kids need.  It really helps them, and even in divorce you can still have strong family you know.  When I got divorced we worked together because the kids are ours.  It's not productive to be enemies because it hurts the kids, so we were on the same page for most things and you know I think the kids are gonna be better for it, so that's another thing that I'd like to get across to black families that are struggling, you know get supports in place and it doesn't even have to be your blood family you know, family by blood, but just supports for people so.
Story_ID: 322864
Speaker 1: The last question we ask is similar to legacy, but a little different.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I had my tombstone saying, and it was something like, she made a difference, you know I would like to be known for having made a positive difference in the lives of African American kids and in terms of diversity in the community in Oak Park [Illinois], that I cared about people and I made a difference to bring people together to help people feel like they're included in everything.  One of my motivations for going after the job of director of multicultural education [for Oak Park Elementary School District 97, Oak Park, Illinois] is that I see it having a key role, the school in the school and the schools having a key role in the successful part as an integrated community, because integration is not easy.  It is hard, I'm finding it's harder now than it seemed to be earlier in my life to me, not real early but I mean since I've been in Oak Park because they're--we have gotten past the surface things.  It's easy to be integrated where you're polite to each other when you talk to each other and then you go your separate ways, but to really be integrated where people can really speak honestly and really understand each other.  That is hard and there's so many subtleties.  I took a class and it was talking about how if you're in the fish bowl, if you're in the water you were born in a fishbowl, you take the water for granted, but if you're dumped into the fishbowl, it's a different environment and you have to pay attention to and it so sometimes whites can't understand when blacks don't get it, there are so many subtle things that happen that we don't know about.  One of the things, I had a conversation with some teachers and they were talking about how when they were in college, the sorority house or the frat house had files of old tests of every test professor X had ever given in the last thirty years, and all the black were like, "What!  I never heard of that, no wonder they were doing so well in the labs 'cause they have all of his labs from the last twenty years and we're going from scratch." So you know these little secrets that people take for granted, they think everybody knows those, but everybody doesn't--getting the secrets out so that everybody has, really is on equal footing and then we have a better relationship with each other.  I think that's what I would like for Oak Park to be a place where it really is a different place, not just the surface thing, which is good, we've gotten beyond the surface but we have a lot farther to scratch and I would like to be a facilitator of that and be known as a person who made a difference in the community.
