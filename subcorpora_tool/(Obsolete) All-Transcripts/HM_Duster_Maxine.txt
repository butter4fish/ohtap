Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Ma'am, could you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Maxine Porter Duster [HistoryMaker Maxine Duster].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: August 23, 1939.
Speaker 1: And, where were you born?
Speaker 2: In Pelham, Texas.
Speaker 1: And how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: P-E-L-H-A-M, T-E-X-A-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--and what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm an educator.
Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth--oh, I have another question.  What is today's date?  I'm sorry, I'm getting ragged here.
Speaker 2: December 22, 2005.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: Chicago, Illinois.  Was that your question?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's--yeah, we're in The HistoryMakers' office.

Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions we always ask, and they only require a short answer.  The first one is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Oh, a favorite food.  I never thought about a favorite food.  It would probably be something sweet, like a cinnamon cookie or something.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Summer.
Speaker 1: Favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Not a favorite destination; probably, would go to a warm climate or whatever and just hang around the beach or whatever, so don't have a lot of extra time to do quote vacations, most of my vacation time is spent visiting family or will have a family gathering, like a family reunion.  We escape with my sisters once or twice a year to Las Vegas [Nevada] or some other designated area like Houston [Texas], just to be with each other.  That's more fun than quote a vacation that is outside of spending it with my family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: If you see it, believe it.
Story_ID: 305358
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [William Porter, Jr.] side.  But we'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Netta Mae Thomas Porter Sims.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, can you spell this for us?
Speaker 2: N-E-T-T-A, M-A-E, Thomas, T-H-O-M-A-S, Porter, P-O-R-T-E-R, S-I-M-S.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: November 30, 1916; 1913, sorry, 1913.
Speaker 1: And the place?
Speaker 2: Pelham, Texas.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what can you tell us about the ancestors on your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: I can go back, I knew her parents.  I should say I knew her mother [Clemmie Thomas].  Her father [Daniel Thomas] died when she was about seven or eight years old, and there was a stepfather following that, so I simply knew her father from stories that she told and I simply have pictures, a picture or two, I should say, of her father and her mother.  Information that I have about her grandparents, I should say my grandparents, are vague.  I simply kind of knew who they were, what they looked like, a little bit about their ancestry, and that, but I never saw pictures of them either.
Speaker 1: What are the stories about them?
Speaker 2: Her grandparents that--her maternal grandparents' ancestry, her grandfather was Caucasian, and his wife was Native American; those would be her grandparents.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: And I don't know much about, you know, the history, how they got together, what kind of lives they lived.  I knew some of the children who remained in the area where I grew up, but I don't have a lot of detailed information about them at all, nor pictures of the grandmother.
Story_ID: 305359
Speaker 1: I know there are some stories about, or can you tell us about, I guess, Pelham--the significance of Pelham, Texas.
Speaker 2: Pelham, Texas is a little community.  It used to be on the map.  It's no longer on the map because the population dwindled to the point, I guess, where it was not recognizable as a community or even a little city being on the map.  Roughly, it's about sixty miles south of Dallas, Texas, and if anyone has heard of Corsicana [Texas] or Waco [Texas], Waco by way of President Bush [President George Walker Bush], I guess, has made that a pretty popular town, but geographically it would be sixty miles south of Dallas, and roughly midway between Corsicana and Waco.  That would be roughly twenty-five or thirty miles in each direction.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, basically it was an agricultural community, occupied almost solely by African Americans, Negro, I guess, at the time, and almost everybody who lived there was related to me in some kind of way, so it was a small community, the land was totally owned by African Americans; again, most of whom were related to me in some kind of way.
Speaker 1: Now, the town was founded by African Americans from what I understand, I guess (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The town--yes, the town was founded by African Americans.  There were about six or eight of them, I guess, who claim as founders of it, my great-grandparents, I understand, migrated there from Tennessee.  I guess their relatives in Tennessee were poor slaves and so they migrated to that territory and bought up the land.  I don't know the history of how they acquired it, who owned it prior to their purchasing it.  I don't know the history on that.
Speaker 1: Okay, from some information that you provided for us, I think that they said the people started settling there in 1866, right after the Civil War.
Speaker 2: Roughly 1866, exactly.  Right after the Civil War, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So they're part of that migration west.
Speaker 2: Exactly, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Are there any stories in the family that are passed down about those days, or about how they got there or what they came in?
Speaker 2: The only stories that I've heard was that they migrated there.  I'm not sure that anyone knows the history of what their lives were like prior to their arrival, so I can only go back that far and I could give you some, you know, dates involved, you know, regarding their arrival and what-not, and there were three brothers who were part of the Porter family, and they settled in that community and bought property; again, I'm not sure how they acquired it, but all three of them were very, I guess you would consider it, distinguished members of the community.  I remember all three of them having really big houses for that era; I mean, huge.  Probably three or four times as big as most of the houses that you would find in an area like that.  So I have very vivid memories of those just roaming through the houses and, you know, sitting on great-grandfather's lap and that sort of thing.  So, I do recall that.  That I do remember.  I was a little girl, but, you know, as children you have pleasant memories of (laughter), you know, sitting on the front porch and, you know, eating your grandmother's home-cooked cake or licking the bowl, you know, from cooking cakes and that sort of thing.  Christmastime was always elegant.  We had cakes.  Grandparents, or whatever other relatives would cook cakes for days and line them up and you get a chance to taste all of it and, you know, sit and eat the candy canes, so those are very pleasant memories.  Apparently they were very, very close, worked very closely together to accomplish what they did.
Story_ID: 305360
Speaker 1: What was the primary economy of Pelham [Texas]?
Speaker 2: At the time, it was almost exclusively agricultural; a combination of--at the time cotton was king as you probably know and so it was a combination of that and other grains in addition to cattle.  So, I would say that those three components were the vehicle by which, you know, all of them made a living.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so at the time your mother [Netta Thomas Porter Sims] was born and it was a thriving town--?
Speaker 2: It was thriving.  Everybody that I have talked to including my mother, grandparents, they all went to school [Ash Creek School; Pelham High School, Pelham, Texas] there.  I recall seeing pictures of, you know, really not necessarily a class but the whole school and sometimes the whole school was only three hundred people or (laughter) something like that, but apparently the people that the teachers who were a part of that school lived in the community, the principal of the school lived in the community, he was a Professor Carroll [Zeno Carroll], you may have heard of that name, a very, very popular name as Professor Carroll, and so, you know, the people lived very harmoniously in that community and really got, I think, some major starts in that community in terms of building, you know, the strong educational backgrounds, et cetera.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what did your mother say about growing up in Pelham, or did she describe--well, you grew up there, too (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I grew up--right.
Speaker 1: --but did she talk about the time that she grew up and what she--kind of things?
Speaker 2: Yes, I've heard both my parents talk about growing up in there and, at the time, I guess there weren't, they had cars but, of course, you know, cars during that era were not as plentiful as we--as they are now, so they did a lot of walking.  In fact, most of them walked to school and walking to school meant at least a mile or more.  In some instances it may have been two miles for some of them, but they all walked to school, you know, primarily in--on unpaved streets, or whatever.  The streets, they were not even called streets; (laughter) they were called roads at the time, but they spent their time walking to school and carrying, you know, the pails with their lunches, and so forth.  So, you know, at the time, I believe I recall the school only went through tenth grade and you graduated from tenth grade and then you had to go to another school that was outside of that community to finish twelfth grade and that's exactly what my parents did as well as most of the other relatives they moved to another school.  I recall vividly my father [William Porter, Jr.] talking about that, and my mother as well, too, saying that they graduated from school twice, from tenth grade and then from twelfth grade.  So, I guess that may have been the norm for that era, I'm not really sure, whether it was unique to that, maybe the district, or whether it was unique across certain parts of the country.
Story_ID: 305361
Speaker 1: Do you know the name of the other school, or do you recall what it was called (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  I know one was located in Corsicana [Texas], and if I remember correctly, my father [William Porter, Jr.] lived with a family or something briefly.  I don't recall the circumstances of my mother [Netta Thomas Porter Sims] and how she acquired that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so your mother finished high school in Corsicana?
Speaker 2: No.  Well, actually she says Pelham [Texas].  They relate it to Pelham, not to Corsicana.  You see what I'm saying?  They always say they graduated from Pelham [Ash Creek School; Pelham High School, Pelham, Texas].
Speaker 1: Even though they may have actually, they graduated in tenth in Pelham and had to go on to Corsicana.
Speaker 2: Right. Exactly, right.  And, my mother went on to college [Texas College, Tyler, Texas].  She spent one year in college.
Speaker 1: Where'd she go?
Speaker 2: She went to, what's the name of the school--it's in Hawkins, Texas [sic.].  Heavens.  Why can't I ever think of the name of it?  It will flash in my mind in a few seconds.
Speaker 1: Not Bishop [Bishop College, Marshall, Texas] or Prairie [Prairie View State Normal and Industrial College; Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas]--
Speaker 2: No, no.  It was in East Texas.  Yes.  It'll cross my mind in a second.  It's in Hawkins, Texas, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: I'll think of it in a few minutes (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, so she went to school, went to college.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  She went one year to college.  She had an older sister who graduated and became a teacher, and she taught in a small town right outside of Waco [Texas], called Clifton, Texas, and during that time many teachers had to go to other small towns and communities to get teaching positions and as a result of that, they often lived in homes with other people; you know, they would rent a space or rent a room, or whatever, with another family, and that's how they survived living outside of their own community.
Story_ID: 305362
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: His name is William Manual Porter, Jr.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I guess it should have been the second, but it was labeled as junior, because he was named for his grandfather.
Speaker 1: Now, how do you spell Manual?
Speaker 2: M-A-N-U-A-L.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, okay, he's a junior.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: What is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: February 10, 1916. Okay.
Speaker 1: My parents were about three years apart.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: My mom [Netta Thomas Porter Sims], the older of the two (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's kind of unusual.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  Very unusual.
Speaker 2: Now, was he born in Pelham [Texas], too?
Speaker 1: He was born in Pelham, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Now, what do you know about the ancestors on your father's side?
Speaker 1: I don't know as much about, well, I don't know as much about my father's mother's [Sarah Porter] people beyond, you know, his mother, but that's the Porter side.  My father is the Porter side and that is primarily--that was primarily the dominant family, I guess, that lived in Pelham of the probably fifty percent of the people were Porters (laughter) in the community so, yes, he was, if you want to know a little more about my father, he had one brother.  There were just two of them.  He, too, was born in Pelham, and the parents, my grandfather [William Porter, Sr.], was born in Pelham and his wife, my father's mother, was born in Italy, Texas, which is just maybe fifteen miles or something from Pelham.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Were they descended from the original founders of the town?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, my father's father.  They were part of the, they were descendants of the original people who moved there.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.  You were saying that the Porters had these big houses--you said, he and the Porters (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, they were all Porters.  There were three brothers and all three of them had, I guess they were kind of like the pillars of the community at that time, as, you know. There was one other sort of a prominent person, I guess in the community but the last name is Martin, and they're all woven into, you know, their relatives as well but I can't sort that out (laughter) as readily as I can some of the others.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So they're sort of, you know, they're all relatives, just a different last name.
Story_ID: 305363
Speaker 1: Did your father [William Porter, Jr.]--what specifically did he say about growing up that--was there anything different for him (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Growing up there [Pelham, Texas], I think they all loved it.  They, they really loved that little community and they were able to thrive in the community.  The community, for the most part, was extremely harmonious and, when you think about living in the community where almost everybody's related to you (laughter) in some kind of way and you know everybody and there's such a tremendous support system in that community, so for the most part the people didn't have to go outside the community in order to have their needs met whether they were financial or otherwise.  They relied so heavily on each other and that's basically how they thrived.  That was kind of my experience in the community, a very small community as that and you're all growing up together, you're all going to church together, you're all going to school together, and you mingle with everybody at least on a weekly basis, you know, at somebody's house, you know, sitting outside eating cake or all those things that people enjoy as a family.  It was just--I think it was a very unusual community.  I don't think I've ever talked to anyone else who grew up in a community that was as unique as that one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You probably heard that yourself through other people that you've talked to who know the community.
Speaker 1: Yeah people, you know, talk about it, you know, with a lot of affection--
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --because we don't seem to have the same kind of life nowadays--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Absolutely, right, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) where everybody knows everybody.
Speaker 2: I think one of the other unique things about the community, too, when you talk about the school [Ash Creek School; Pelham High School, Pelham, Texas], people who taught at the school lived in the community and, for the most part, they were our relatives.  So, you know, you have Professor Carroll [Zeno Carroll] who was there.
Speaker 1: Was he related, too?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was related, right.  He was related, um-hm.  I still keep in touch with his children.  We all see each other at least every two years, so there was, you know, he was, I think really the, sort of the groundbreaker for making that school as qualitative as I think it was, with a great deal of recognition and respect, not only in the community but throughout the surrounding communities.
Story_ID: 305364
Speaker 1: What can you tell us about him [Zeno Carroll] in terms of where he went to school and where he got some of his ideas, or maybe how he was able to generate support for the school [Ash Creek School; Pelham High School, Pelham, Texas]?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know that as I understand it.  I don't remember him per se.  I just remember his name and how people talked about it, but apparently he was a very charismatic person, described as brilliant and was very, very resourceful and bringing whatever recognition as well as resources to that school is possible, and I think given a small community like that, if you think about the number of people who graduated from high school, and that was really phenomenal, I guess, for a certain generation even to go that far, but to have so many of them from a community to complete college and then come back to the community, I think it's probably history in itself in terms of a small community like that.
Speaker 1: So that was pretty much from what you're saying, that people will come back to Pelham [Texas] after they--
Speaker 2: A lot of people came back to the community.  There was a time when, I think my generation, because they're, we were, so many of us graduated from college and there were no resources, no industry or anything else for the most part that would allow us to make a living, so my generation for the most part moved away to surrounding towns, Dallas [Texas], Fort Worth [Texas], Houston [Texas], a number of them went to Midland, Texas, and then a few to California, so that was kind of the concentration of most of the people who left that community in order to make a living, because you couldn't do it, you know, in the same manner that previous generations had done.
Speaker 1: Ok.  So just one more quick question about Professor Carroll.  Was he, what era, I mean what was he--when did he really exert his influence?
Speaker 2: I would think in the early 1900s, because, you know I've often heard my mom [Netta Thomas Porter Sims] and my dad [William Porter, Jr.] talk so highly of him because he was the Professor Carroll at the school and, you know, he just ran it.  I don't know, he ran it so that everybody thrived in it and everybody who has heard anything about him speaks of him so highly as being this brilliant, you know, person who kept things in order and set high expectations for people who went through that school.  I'd say the school as well as the community as well.
Speaker 1: Is there a story about him that people tell, or like to tell? (Unclear).
Speaker 2: I don't remember any specific stories except that he was, you know, this very brilliant person (laughter).  Now that you're bringing that question up, I perhaps, should get some more information 'cause, you know, his children are still living so--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seemed like he was really important for the--yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was.  He was a very, very important person in the community and the surrounding communities as well, very highly respected.
Speaker 1: Do you remember his first name?
Speaker 2: Oh my goodness.  I don't remember his first name.  Isn't that awful?
Speaker 1: We can get it.  But as long as we have it on record here--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. I mean, we just referred to him as Professor Carroll and I'll remember his first name in a little while.
Story_ID: 305365
Speaker 1: Your father [William Porter, Jr.]--now he graduated from high school, too.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And he--did he go on to college?
Speaker 2: No.  My father didn't go to college.  No.
Speaker 1: So, did he basically stay at Pelham [Texas] to work for (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My father stayed in the community, you know, worked the land the same as his, you know, his father [William Porter, Sr.] and his grandfather did.  And they all, you know, owned land that was primarily contiguous to each other or whatever, so, you know, it was kind of like, and sometimes you didn't know the difference between his father's land, or let's just say I didn't know the difference.  I'm sure they did, but it sort of overlapped a little bit.  In our minds as children, we never knew the difference 'cause we lived in walking distance of them and we spent time in their house, and when my father was doing work on the land or whatever, often they would work as a team, so in my head, as a child, I didn't recognize the difference how it was divided.  I didn't recognize that until I became an adult, you know, how it was separated.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I knew the difference between his, my father's land, and his brother's land, but I didn't know the difference between my father's land and his father's land because they did it so closely, they worked so closely together that the children didn't recognize the difference.
Speaker 1: Is there a story about--I know that--well, we can pretty much guess how your parents met, 'cause it's a pretty small place (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.
Speaker 1: But, is there a story about how they started to court and how they kind of got together.
Speaker 2: No, I remember my dad saying something, you know.  He said he thought my mother [Netta Thomas Porter Sims] was so beautiful (laughter), so beautiful or whatever, and my apparently was very athletic and, you know, she played basketball and softball and was a good student and, I guess, in a way, too, she was a little bit feisty, too, but very outgoing and, whatever, so I agreed with him, too, she was a very beautiful woman, so that may have been, you know, how he became attracted to her.  I'm not really sure.  I don't know anything that's more in-depth than that; that he was, you know, simply attracted to her.
Story_ID: 305366
Speaker 1: Okay, 'cause there must be some kind of a story with him [Duster's father, William Porter, Jr.] being younger than her [Duster's mother, Netta Thomas Porter Sims], it seems like there would be a little drama in there somewhere (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, I don't know that story.  I've never, I've never heard them mention anything about, you know, having that difference make a difference with them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But you're probably true that that was probably very unusual for that generation, maybe.  You know, usually they were a couple of years older, or whatever, or even more significantly older.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Men are usually much older than their wives--
Speaker 2: I don't remember, I assume, I don't remember, they may have been, you know, a year apart in classes.  I'm not really sure on that, you know, 'cause sometimes, you know, the men, as they got into their teen years, would have to spend more time, you know, doing laborious kinds of things and the women would continue to go to school and I think that was definitely true in terms of them going to college; more women went to college.  Well that's still true today, but it was only true during that era, when both my sis--both my mother and her sister went to college.  Her sister graduated and became a teacher, as I mentioned, and her two brothers did not go to college, so.
Speaker 1: I think we could probably generalize that's not true--wasn't true in a white community in those days.
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  I'm specifically speaking about a black community.
Speaker 1: Because in a black community, that's interesting and somebody could follow up, I guess, and look in--I mean try to find out what the stats were for them.
Speaker 2: Right.  I haven't the vaguest idea what that's--
Speaker 1: I believe you.  I think your experience is probably true.
Speaker 2: Right, um-hm.  I think that, you know, whenever I even think about my [maternal] grandparents [Clemmie Thomas and Daniel Thomas], my grandparents' siblings, and there was one girl in the middle of, what, eight or nine children, and she was the one who went to college.  So, I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: And usually they went to school to become a teacher.
Speaker 2: That's exactly because that was the one occupation where, you know, African Americans, though, I guess we were black at the time, could get work.  There was very little work outside of that.  That was pretty true for my generation.  I mean, corporate America was not ready for us, for my generation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, many of us became teachers.
Story_ID: 305367
Speaker 1: Could you describe your parents' [Netta Thomas Porter Sims and William Porter, Jr.] personalities and tell us, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Both.  I look, one day I look in the mirror and I see my mother and another day I look in the mirror and I see my father; so, as far as physical characteristics, I am really a cross between the two.  Let's see, in terms of personalities, my mother was a lot quieter, but she would have her feisty moments, too, where she was not one who took a lot of crap, so-to-speak.  Very talented, she was a seamstress, you know, could just look at a dress in the store and come home and make it, you know, without a pattern.  My father was very outgoing.  He had lots of friends all over the place.  He loved to hang around with, you know, people in the community [Pelham, Texas] like the men had their little gathering places or whatever, and so he was generally a part of that, very recognized outside the community, and he another, he had a cousin in the community.  He spent a lot of time with him because he was, he liked to joke and laugh and, you know, just sit around having plain fun.  Sometimes it was just simply on the porch or under the tree or whatever, but he was kind of the fun, outgoing person, and my mom was a little more reserved.
Story_ID: 671356
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Earliest childhood memory?  Oh, I can remember--I guess there are a few things, or whatever, but one of the things that stands out in my mind when you think about an early childhood memory was walking to school [Ash Creek School; Pelham High School, Pelham, Texas] every day, and we lived about a mile away from the school, and, as I said, there was one white family that lived in our community [Pelham, Texas] and we were cordial to each other but not socially, you know, connected, and so we had to walk by their house every day and when we would wave, or whatever, and there was one of them had, one of the persons who lived in the houses, I mean, there were siblings, a woman and her family who lived in one house, and then her brother and his family lived in the other one, but I remember, you know, when we would walk by--they had children who were our age, and sometimes they would want to come out and talk to us or whatever, and their parents wouldn't allow them to do it.  So, that I remember vividly from early childhood, and I just remember having fun walking to school with all my siblings.  We would just, you know, we would leave in time not to be late, but we would play on the way (laughter) walking to school or whatever, and I remember vividly when, 'cause I start, I had an older sister, she's two years older, and she started to school and, at the time, she would not, she refused to go to school unless I went with her and so my mom [Netta Thomas Porter Sims] started sending me to school so she would go to school (laughter), and the teachers would allow me to stay there, so eventually, I guess I started to get involved in the classwork or whatever, and so, at the time because I was underage, they had to get, I guess, a general superintendent, you know, for that territory, came out and they were going to allow me to stay in school as long as I could pass an oral reading test; I guess, that was heard by the superintendent.  I remember, you know, sort of being very stiff walking up to the table (laughter) with the idea that I have to read aloud to this person, but I remember I just kind of read the words real fast or whatever, and so they asked me to slow it down and so I remember that vividly, just being scared stiff.  That was something that really stands out in my head.  But, anyway, they let me stay in school so I was a year behind my sister, even though she was two years older, so I thought I was a big girl.
Story_ID: 671357
Speaker 1: Can you describe, you know, where you grew up, and what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up [in Pelham, Texas]?
Speaker 2: Oh, wow.  Because it was, you know, generally a rural area the sights and sounds were, you know, we lived around, you know, the cattle so I rode a horse when I was little.  I rode a horse and we had to gather the horses, not the horses, but the cattle sometimes to go to a specific area within the pasture and we did that, so we walked all over.  I remember fishing and finding crayfish, or whatever, in little ponds or whatever, and we had the little fishing pole and you put the little piece of worm or whatever you found, some kinds of piece of fat meat and put a nail on it so it'd sink, and then we'd catch the crawfish and, you know, and we'd take them home and pull the tail off and, you know, it'd be like a little piece of shrimp (laughter) to us and just, you know, just general things and making up our own games because we didn't have toys the way children have toys today.  I mean, at best you had a doll and a dollhouse. So beyond that, we made up our own games.  I mean, we could make a game up, you know, in no time, throwing the ball and riding on the tires and racing, you know, on the roads and whatever.  Eventually we got a bicycle.  I think my mother's [Netta Thomas Porter Sims] brother gave that to me for a birthday or something, so that was really a highlight of every--you know, everybody was riding that.  But, it was--it was a wonderful, wonderful childhood, 'cause we spent so much time with relatives.  Your relatives were your friends and your supporters and everything, and running up to, you know, grandfather's house and eating chocolate ice cream.  At the time, they had a freezer.  They may have been atypical for that time, but he had a freezer, so, you know, so he kept chocolate ice cream in there all the time.  That was a treat.  Watermelon during the summertime, and we'd sit on the porch, you know, and eat watermelon with my grandfather (laughter), and then he was also, he loved bananas so, you know, we'd go and we'd get a banana.  That was, and then we'd sit on the porch and talk to my grandfather you know, about that so these are very, you know, they're simple activities, but they're vivid in your memories, and then you have established that close bond, you know, with your grandparents which, you know, is extremely memorable and, you know, oftentimes children live distances from their grandparents, in other states and other cities, and they don't have an opportunity to bond, you know, with grandparents the way we did; not only grandparents, but grandparents--I mean, great-grandparents.
Story_ID: 671358
Speaker 1: I knew my great-grand- my paternal great-grandparents extremely well.  He was a story-teller, and we would sit in the room while he told stories to us, and then he was blind when I remembered him, so we would read things to him as well, so that he would remember them and he loved Kool-Aid, so we used to make Kool-Aid for him.  We'd go make a big jug of Kool-Aid, you know, and he'd sit with the Kool-Aid on the table or whatever, and then he'd tell stories and we'd watch him, you know, tell, listen to him tell the stories and then he'd drink Kool-Aid, you know (laughter).  That was just phenomenal.
Speaker 2: That's--for some reason, I'm gonna ask this even though it may sound strange, but I don't know how long Kool-Aid's been around and I guess, was it around when you were a little kid?
Speaker 1: Yes, it was around when I was a little kid.  We only knew it as Kool-Aid, you know.  It may have, I don't know if it had another name or not, but that's exactly how I remembered it was Kool-Aid, you know?
Speaker 2: I just didn't know.  I just never thought about it (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, and it was unsweetened at the time, so you had to add your own sugar, so that may have changed--
Speaker 2: That's the way it was when I was coming along, you had to add sugar to it.
Speaker 1: --it may have changed now.  Right, um-hm.  So, that was my great-grandfather and his wife, and his wife was very quiet and subdued, and just the warmest person in the world, and I just remembered having chicken pox, or something, and I don't know, for some reason I was at my [paternal] grandmother's [Sarah Porter] house, and they were, at that point, living with them because they couldn't take care of themselves, you know, 'cause he was blind and then she was deteriorating so she went to the house with him at that point, and she would, you know, rub your back and things like that, and tell you stories or whatever. Anyway, sometimes like, we called him Papa Porter (laughter) and he would make up stories as he would go along.  We eventually figured that out, you know, "Well, that didn't quite match with the last part that you told us," or whatever, but he would make it, he would continue to go on until he felt that we were satisfied with it.  A great storyteller.
Speaker 2: Now, can you remember any stories or parts of stories?
Speaker 1: I just remember--he would make them up, so a lot of times it would be they would be ghost stories and--
Speaker 2: Did they call them ghost then, or did they call them haints or--
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're called ghosts.
Speaker 2: They're called ghosts?  Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they call 'em ghosts. I do recall one person in the community [Pelham, Texas] who referred to them as haints, and she would sit on our porch, you know, and tell stories and we would be scared stiff; it would be like children now who are reading 'Goosebumps' [R.L. Stine] or something and just scared stiff, but you would want more and then at nighttime, we'd have to huddle up until we were off the scared (laughter)--the scared-ness that we were feeling, or whatever.  But my great-grandfather referred to them as ghost stories, whatever.  But they were very, very vivid to the point where they, you know, they were real to us and we eventually figured out that he was making them up all along.  Just a wonderful person; very, very bright mind, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.  In general, did people believe in ghosts and that sort of thing?
Speaker 1: I think some people did believe in ghosts or whatever.  I do remember the woman that I just referred to used to make up the, could tell the haint stories or whatever.  I think she really believed in ghosts, I mean, and she would make it so real and so vivid that we, you know, would say, oh well, you know, it must be real but eventually you would start to say, well something doesn't make sense about it, you know, and then it made it much more unbelievable in terms of it being real.
Story_ID: 671359
Speaker 1: Was radio prominent when you were coming along?
Speaker 2: Radio was it, okay?  We had one radio in our house and we, as children, listened to 'The Lone Ranger,' and there was a ghost story that came, I have forgotten the name of it, but ghost stories that came on and we huddle around--
Speaker 1: With the lights out or something?
Speaker 2: Yeah, with the lights out or whatever, and then you know the screeching sound, you know, at the beginning of it and we'd be sitting there all huddled up, you know, all four or six of us, listening to this and just wondering what's gonna happen next or whatever, and then we'd cheer for the Lone Ranger.  We'd forget Tonto, you know (laughter) that was the way it was built up.  You were supposed to prefer the Lone Ranger, not Tonto, but if you think about it as you get older, Tonto was doing all the work and he would report, you know, his findings to the Lone Ranger, so we figured that eventually.  And then, we'd listen to music.  My mom [Netta Thomas Porter Sims] was, you know, it was a combination of country music, I guess, which was pretty, that was kind of what was on radio at the time, more country music, and then, you know, as we got older in our teens or whatever, you had the bee-bop era, where we could listen to that, but we never had a record player and we never had, I never had a television in my house until I was in college [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas]; I should say maybe the year I went away to college, we got a television set, but we had no television set.  We went to my grandmother's house to watch television.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We lived at my grandmother's house.  Every day we were there, you know, eating ice cream or whatever, in my grandmother's house, and we walked there almost every day to watch some show that came on after school.
Speaker 1: You were back when television kind of became popular.  You were what, about ten I guess, or--?
Speaker 2: Something like that, yeah.  I can't remember, I can't even remember the name of the show that we used to watch that was an after-school program or whatever, um-hm, so no, I didn't miss television though.  I didn't think I missed anything.  And you had to think about what was on television and maybe there were a couple of channels at the time, I don't remember, and television for the most part did not reflect us, and radio, you know was 'Amos 'n' Andy' or whatever, and I don't remember my family being really big fans of 'Amos 'n' Andy,' as they were, you know, popularized, you know, during that era.
Story_ID: 671360
Speaker 1: Um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now was Pelham [Texas] a place, and were you parents [Netta Thomas Porter Sims and William Porter, Jr.], I guess, the people that raised you, very race conscious in terms of--I know it being a black town I just wondered what the race consciousness was and--
Speaker 1: They were, they were, and you know, our first--my first awareness of it was the two white families who lived, you know, they were kind of to themselves or whatever.  They did not--none of their land was contiguous to ours, but you know the main road they were, and the schools were so segregated, so they went--the big yellow bus came to pick them up every day, but we had to walk.  So, you know, many of us were walking, you know, two miles, you know, to go to school [Ash Creek School; Pelham High School, Pelham, Texas].  Had we been white, of course, we would have been picked up by a big yellow bus, but that was not the case.  So, but it was interesting later on when I met the daughter who lived in one of those houses, she came up to me, and I had not seen her in years, and she said, "You know what?"  She said, "Every time you guys would pass by my house, I would want to just go out and walk to school with you but we weren't allowed to do that."  And she said, "You know, you guys," she said, "You seemed to be having so much fun," or whatever.  And then I think about when I compare how well we did, you know, coming out of that kind of environment, you know, that was suppressed in many ways because of segregation, and compared it with that, we just excelled way beyond what these families accomplished and when you compare the two; so, that was kind of interesting to me and I didn't sort of analyze it until I was older, you know.  It's interesting.
Story_ID: 671361
Speaker 1: What would you describe your personality as being like when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: My personality?  Oh, everybody--I think I felt like a quiet person and I was number two in birth order, having an older sister.
Speaker 1: How many of you are there?
Speaker 2: Six.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There are six of us with one boy [Darnell Porter] kind of stuck in the middle.  So I was number two, and my older sister was very tall compared to me.  She's like 5'9" or something like that, so that was tall for that generation and she was a phenomenal athlete and I was this little runt, you know, kind of second to my sister and so she played basketball and softball and she was like the star in both basketball and softball (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now this is--today we hear a lot of discussion about it, and it's true for most of, you know, women's athletics really just started jumping off here in the late '70s [1970s], I guess mid to late '70s [1970s] in the United States and college athletics and that sort of thing, but when I hear stories from this era of people in the black schools and a lot of girls playing basketball and playing softball and that sort of thing--
Speaker 2: Oh absolutely. Absolutely, and they were just, I mean, talented; very, very talented.  My sister, you know, was one of 'em.  She was just, I mean, she was a phenomenal basketball player and, you know, and other people in the community as well, but, you know, when I compare her to me, you know, I was just this little runt, this little runty little girl trying to be as athletic as my sister, and of course, I was never that.  She was a tremendous basketball player, and then she was the pitcher on a softball team and she had a pitch that nobody could hit, (laughter) and then I played shortstop, so I rarely had to run for any balls because she struck everybody out.  She was that good.  She probably could have been pro if it had been, you know, the right time.  So, you know, and I tagged along with her to some degree.  The next in line was my brother, so the way we were in birth order, she was number one, I was number two, so we were kind of paired off and then the third child was a brother and then the fourth one was a sister and so they paired off, and the last two were twins; they were fraternal twins, but they, you know, it's like we were all in little pairs.  Excuse me--we were all in little pairs. So, I was, you know, that's the way we grew up, and so I was, you know, in with this, sort of coupled with my older sister and she was much, she was a much better athlete than I was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And it sounds like, I mean, if she gains notoriety for athletics, I mean the community supported girls in athletics, I guess. And came out for the games (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, we did.  Absolutely, absolutely, but we had basketball and we played competitive basketball with all the schools in the surrounding communities and, by far, there may have been one community within a radius of where we played that maybe could beat us at any time.  There were trophies all over the place, not only from the generation that I was there but from the generation before that.  My mother [Netta Thomas Porter Sims] was a basketball player.
Speaker 1: Did it surprise you later on when you come to a city like Chicago [Illinois] and girls' athletics is not really dealt with, or kind of takes a back burner?
Speaker 2: I don't think it surprises me because, I think, because we were in a unique situation and, you know, people in that community were so creative and they were in a position where they could make their own decisions about what came into the community and whatnot, so that was really, I think, a rare thing, so had we been in another community in a surrounding town, we would not have had the same kind of opportunities.  I really don't think so.  When you--again, when I compare people from that community with another surrounding town, maybe Hubbard [Texas] or Corsicana [Texas], or whatever, and we were always in those communities, I don't think they thrived the same way.  When I think about thriving, I'm talking about academically, you know, because we basically governed ourselves, so there was nobody there to tell us what we could and could not do.
Speaker 1: In terms of the black community in Pelham [Texas].
Speaker 2: Exactly, in Pelham.  We ruled ourselves.  We ruled ourselves.
Speaker 1: (Camera displacement) So it compares to black folks in other communities, you're saying--
Speaker 2: Right.  Exactly.  Particular where they didn't own their property, and I think the primary difference is because we owned the land and we worked the land, so we were never sharecroppers or anything like that, so I think that made a huge difference because you could call, you know, the shots for yourself.
Speaker 1: Being a stakeholder is different, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly.  Exactly.
Story_ID: 671362
Speaker 1: (Camera displacement) Tell me about school now.  What was your school like in terms of size and number of teachers, and how was it academically for you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was elementary, high school combined, although they were in separate buildings.  When I was growing up there were two separate buildings.
Speaker 1: It was called Pelham [Ash Creek School; Pelham High School, Pelham, Texas]?
Speaker 2: Pelham.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It was Pelham High School?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  I think originally, originally it was Ash Creek High School [Ash Creek School, Pelham, Texas] for my parents [Netta Thomas Porter Sims and William Porter, Jr.] and then, of course, it just transitioned into Pelham.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, when I was growing up there were two separate buildings and, for the most part, the elementary students were in one building and the high school students in another, and the high school may have included an eighth grade; I can't remember.  But, you know, two separate--they were just right, and walk, you know, a few paces apart, maybe ten, you know, just a little pathway between the two.
Speaker 1: And, when you started school, Dr. Carroll [Zeno Carroll] had passed, right?
Speaker 2: He had passed and he was the principal when my parents were there.  The principal who was there when I went to school, and he was the only person that I remember, his last name was Davenport [W.P. Davenport].
Speaker 1: Was he called Professor Davenport? Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Professor.  Professor Davenport, and so he was the principal and he also taught in the classroom.  He had a dual role, but he was very, extremely resourceful, too.  Just was well known, very respected person all over, but I don't think that he had the same, you know, reputation as being this brilliant person as Professor Carroll had for that, during his time there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think Professor Carroll, I mean he spoke, you know, I think he spoke, he was fluent in Spanish and, you know, it's just unreal.
Speaker 1: That's a character that we probably, you know, if it wasn't for an oral history like this I don't know if there would be a lot of record of him, you know.
Speaker 2: Probably not, except through his children who, for the most part, live in the Denver [Colorado] area.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what was your favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: English.  That was my favorite subject.  And--so I can't think of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Composition or literature--
Speaker 2: A little bit of both, except I wasn't crazy about, I wasn't crazy about world literature.  I think it's because of, you know, maybe a lack of exposure that there wasn't anything that was concrete that would, you know, grab my interest or make me fascinated about it, but yes, I would say English was the number one with a little American literature, you know, fused into that.
Story_ID: 671363
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite teacher or teachers in school [Ash Creek School; Pelham High School, Pelham, Texas]?
Speaker 2: I don't think I had a favorite.  I just remember all of them for different reasons, you know, vivid memories of all of them for different reasons.  I would say that probably my first grade teacher, you know, probably had more of an attachment for her.  She was a cousin (laughter).  Almost everybody there was a cousin, except the Davenports were not relatives, and I think she gave me a really good start and they did not put limitations on you as far as you could go, you know, and sometimes you could go to the next classroom or whatever, and do your math or do your reading and then come back to your classroom.  You know, that was unique.  And then, I think the other unique thing about it is that we had what's even though today they call it cooperative learning, but when you had a class where you have multiple, we had multiple tasks and somebody may be gifted in one thing, and then somebody's gifted in another, you all came together to accomplish a task.  So, it was kind of like support, you know, for each other but now we call it cooperative learning.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't remember it being labeled at that time.  But, as I said, if you were beyond where your classroom was in math or whatever, you could go to the next room or just walk over there and have math with them.
Speaker 1: So, you didn't have a chance to get bored?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I was never bored in school, never.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, I saw some little newsletters that were produced by the school recently.  One of my sisters had just copies of them and I looked through them, maybe over three or four years or something like that, and all of my siblings had perfect attendance.  So, my mom [Netta Thomas Porter Sims] got us out of school--she got us out of the house every day.  So, but we loved school.  Nobody wanted to be absent from school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, I take it you were a good student.  I just take it--
Speaker 2: Yes, I was a pretty good student.  I didn't think of that when I was going to school.  You know, I don't think, I don't know, I think students don't think about that, at least not until you, maybe somebody dwells on it that you start to think of yourself as a good student, but we didn't have that.  I graduated, you know, in my class.  I was top of my class.  But I never thought about my being a good student, no.  I didn't identify it as such and nobody ever told me, you know.  You just do the work or whatever.  So, and even when I went to college [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas], you know, that was pretty much the same thing.  I didn't, you know, when we entered college, of course, we had to take all these entrance exams and whatever, and you know, I was one of eight students who, you know, got exempt from some of that, but I didn't, I didn't recognize myself as (air quotes) quote a good student.  I just didn't--it never crossed my mind.
Story_ID: 671364
Speaker 1: What church did you grow up in?  Did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A Methodist church [Wesley United Methodist Church, Pelham, Texas]. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is the--I want to get it, the United Methodist and the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church and a Baptist Church, I think, in the town [Pelham, Texas] right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  There were three churches.  There was a Methodist church, an African American Methodist church, just plain Methodist, and a Baptist.  There were three churches in the community, and I belong to just the Methodist church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, and that was the church where my parents [Netta Thomas Porter Sims and William Porter, Jr.] and grandparents and great-grandparents all went to that church.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They still do.  I mean, all of the descendants still pretty much keep the church up.  It still exists.  It still exists, and they've done some, maybe I think there was one small addition to it or something like that, but it's still the same church that I went to every Sunday.
Speaker 1: Now were you really, really involved when you were growing up in the church in terms of--?
Speaker 2: I think there were two areas where all of us were involved; the school [Ash Creek School; Pelham High School, Pelham, Texas] and the church.  They were the social outlets for us, so when you left home, you know, your siblings, you know, playing games and whatever, I mean your social life was centered around what was happening in school and what was happening in church.  It was not that it was, there were religious activities all the time.  There were social activities.  You went to church, and then, you know, after church or Sunday afternoon you would have a social activity or picnic or whatever, and the school was the same way.  You had your, you know, your dances inside the school, 'cause we didn't have a recreational center or anything like that, so all these social activities were pretty much there.  All of the, you know, the basketball games and the softball games, they were all centered around a big picnic; you know, right there on the premise.  So that was it.
Story_ID: 671365
Speaker 1: When you were on the verge of graduating from high school [Ash Creek School; Pelham High School, Pelham, Texas]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now did you have to go to the next town [Corsicana, Texas], too, you did graduate from Pelham (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.  Right, um-hm.  I think that was just for my parents' [Netta Thomas Porter Sims and William Porter, Jr.] generation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: After that, it was, you know you didn't have to, I got cut off at tenth grade.
Speaker 1: Did your sister go to college?  The athlete?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  All of us, all of us.  All six of us.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how did you decide what college you were going to go to?
Speaker 2: My mother's brother, actually it's one of my mother's brothers, had moved to Midland, Texas and he, you know, had his family with him and he has a daughter who is the same age as I am.  We're a month apart, and so, he had looked at schools for his daughter and she had chosen Texas Southern University [Houston, Texas], and so my mom had spent the summer out there and so she decided that that would be a good place for me.  In the meantime, my sister had completed a year at Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], you know, as I said she's a year ahead of me so she had finished a full year at Tennessee State, but I didn't think about Tennessee State because I felt that it was too far away from home, and then she had gone there and had lived with a relative's family for the first year to avoid out-of-state tuition, which was pretty heavy, and so I ended up at Texas Southern, basically through the support and suggestion of my mother's brother, who's sending his daughter, the same age as I was when I went to Texas Southern.  That's how I ended up there.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: It's not that I sought it out.  Really, I had about six or seven universities whose names were familiar to me because other people had gone; Huston-Tillotson [Houston-Tillotson College, Austin, Texas], a lot of the people in Pelham [Texas] had gone to Huston-Tillotson.  Wiley College [Marshall, Texas] was one that I was trying to remember (laughter).  I knew they would come to me.  My mom had gone to Wiley College [sic. Texas College, Tyler, Texas].
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've heard of that.
Speaker 2: That's where she went.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, so.
Speaker 1: So, well, you had to move to Houston [Texas], right, to go to Texas Southern.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, right.  I lived in the dorm.  I lived in the dorm the whole time I was in school.  I lived in the dorm and the cousin that I referred to was my roommate my first year, and then after that we found other people, you know, meeting other people and roomed with them as well, so I lived in the dormitory the whole time I was there, just a wonderful experience.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell us something about Texas Southern.  That's a state school.
Speaker 2: It's a state school, right.  Um-hm.  It's a state school.  I think it was founded in 1949 [sic.].  I think it was 1949; a relatively young university when you think about, you know, when it was founded.
Speaker 1: You graduated from high school in, what, '50--?
Speaker 2: In '56 [1956], '56 [1956].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I graduated from Texas Southern in '61 [1961], but I had to drop out for a year, because my sister, who was at Tennessee State at the time was about to graduate and with the two of us in school at the same time, it was a financial strain so one of us had to give and since she was graduating, I yielded to her.
Story_ID: 304690
Speaker 1: Texas Southern University [Houston, Texas].
Speaker 2: Texas Southern University, one of my favorite universities.
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty-six [1956].
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-six [1956], I was a freshman.
Speaker 1: Now, when you were a freshman, big news around the country was Montgomery Bus Boycott, I mean, for a lot of black people.
Speaker 2: Roughly.
Speaker 1: Was anything like that going on in Houston [Texas]?
Speaker 2: No, not that I was aware of.  It was pretty quiet at the time, but maybe a year or two later I can't, you know, those sequential years or whatever, you know, that the boycotts were starting and the sit-ins and all of that.
Speaker 1: So, how did you feel about coming from an all-black town, Pelham [Texas], to Houston to go to college, which is, you know, you were going to a more sophisticated town, then you get there, you've got a segregated town?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: How did you feel about that?
Speaker 2: Actually, it didn't bother me.  It did not bother me that I was going to, you know, a predominantly African American university, because I felt that I could still be me.  I didn't have to compete against people who may not feel that I was equal, or whatever, so it was a very, very comfortable setting for me; extremely comfortable, because let's see, I just said (unclear) knew this one cousin who was there, so that was kind of like, you know, a support system.  But, after I got there, the university, I mean the people, the professors, and so forth were so supportive.  I mean, they never, if you failed it was because you didn't seek out support.
Speaker 1: Now, what I was really referring to was the town. I suppose the university would be supportive (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, the town, oh, oh.  The City of Houston, you know, it didn't bother me because Houston was very segregated and Texas Southern is located in the Third Ward [Houston, Texas], which is, you know, it was predominantly African American at the time and, for the most part, we didn't venture too far outside of that arena, you know, the college campus and then whatever you could walk to beyond that, because most of us couldn't, we didn't have transportation and it was rare that we got on a bus, you know, to go, you know, downtown shopping or anything like that.  For the most part, we couldn't afford to go off the campus, you know, for too many activities.  There was a jazz club in walking distance.  When I say in walking distance, it was about maybe twelve blocks or something, which was, I guess, nothing for a university student and we used to walk there in groups to go hear some of the great jazz artists.  It costs fifty cents to go.
Speaker 1: Who would come there?
Speaker 2: I remember [HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson, and, you know, several of the saxophone players, I remember.  I'm trying to remember the names of them.
Speaker 1: So, Nancy Wilson?
Speaker 2: Nancy Wilson.  She was like a baby practically.  I mean she was very young, but she--
Speaker 1: She was college age, I heard something, she went to Central State [Central State College; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio], I think.
Speaker 2: And Etta Jones (laughter), I remember going there for her; so, you know, we had plenty of things to do.  We didn't necessarily have to leave the campus.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So no, you know, I was not overwhelmed by it.  I was not necessarily intrigued by it.  I was just, you know, just another place to find comfort.  So I didn't feel out of place at all.  No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 304691
Speaker 1: And then, as I said, you know, we had relatives who lived in walking distance of the school [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas].  There were--my mother [Netta Thomas Porter Sims] had relatives there and occasionally would come and pick as up and we'd spend the day with them. And, you know, Jake's [HistoryMaker Jacob H. Carruthers, Jr.] sister [Carol Lee] lived in walking distance so we'd go by there and clean the refrigerator, or whatever, spend the night, so--
Speaker 2: That's Jacob Carruthers (unclear)--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Your cousin.
Speaker 1: Right, our cousin, my cousin--
Speaker 2: That we also interviewed.  I don't know if we said it on tape, but that's what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, exactly.
Speaker 2: Yeah. So, what--your major was education?
Speaker 1: Right.  Actually I started out in physical education because that was the one thing you knew about, you heard about, or whatever.  So, it was either in some form of education for the most part, that most of us ventured.  There were other majors that you could have there; pharmacy, you know, the sciences, whatever, but--and then there was a pre-law program, but for the most part there was a huge concentration in education and few people ventured beyond that, because when you get out, you know, what could you do (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, well--did you have any particular teachers who were mentors or played a significant role?
Speaker 1: A number of them, a number of teachers.  I had a very good relationship with almost every professor that I ever had.  They were very, very supportive.  They really would seek you out to see if you needed support or whatever, and any time you went to them for a problem that was academically related, or some other problem, they would help you solve it.  I had the wonderful, wonderful relationships with just about everybody, the administration, even the president, who was Sam Nabrit [Samuel M. Nabrit], at the time, who was the brother to Dr. Nabrit [James M. Nabrit, Jr.] who was at Howard University [Washington, D.C.] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, James Nabrit, the attorney.
Speaker 1: Exactly, they were brothers, and so both of them, as you recognize, you know, were very, very visionary people and they both sought to have universities that were recognizable for academic achievement as well as their pleasantries, I would say.  So, Dr. Nabrit ran a very, very tight ship and he brought a lot of programs to the university that allowed us to have exposure to things that we couldn't afford ourselves, introducing us to Shakespearean theater, you know, the opera, you know, that sort of thing; otherwise, we would not have had, very few of us would have had an opportunity to be exposed, you know, by way of our families.  So that was really an asset to--but almost all, I didn't have one, all of my professors at Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas] were African American, and I believe all of them had Ph.Ds.  So, they were role models themselves, basically.
Speaker 2: Okay. Is there a favorite out of this group?
Speaker 1: One of the favorites was probably the person who was chairman of my department, because she was so supportive of me, and she kind of guided me in the direction so that maybe I got some recognition as a student at the university.  Just little small things at the university, and also the person who was the dorm matron (laughter) for the dormitory where I was at, got, you know, a lot of support from her.
Story_ID: 304692
Speaker 1: And eventually, you know, got referred to, you know, the president [Samuel M. Nabrit] for certain kinds of things; one of the things that I recognized that he did for me, which was a total surprise, John F. Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] was a candidate for the presidency.  He and his brother, Robert [Robert F. Kennedy], came to campus.  It may have been one of the only or certainly very few, predominantly African American college, universities, where they came on campus (laughter) you know, to mobilize students and I was the sole student who was selected by the president to go to this huge gathering by--which featured President Kennedy and his brother, Robert.  So that was something.  That was recognition beyond my even expectations, basically, to be represented, you know, to be the representative of the student body, so that was nice.
Speaker 2: Now, well, tell us about that experience.  This is 1959 or '60 [1960] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That was nineteen--was that 1959 or, it had to be '59 [1959] I guess, the fall of '59 [1959] maybe?
Speaker 2: No, the election, I know, was 1960, I believe; no, fall of '59 [1959] I guess, it would be.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it had to be the fall of '59 [1959] I think, right, exactly.  So, that was, you know, that was very memorable to me, and it was something that I didn't expect to be chosen to do that.  That was kind of interesting.
Speaker 2: What were they--did you see them at the time as big celebrities or did you--
Speaker 1: Oh, I did because, I did, absolutely, because Bobby came to the campus and just walked around, you know.  Students were following him everywhere.  You know, he would stop and talk to groups of students.  That was just unheard of.  I don't think that ever happened.  I can't remember anyone else running for office, local or otherwise, who made a stop at a predominantly black university.  We were just ignored.  We didn't exist, you know, and some of them, you know, were just coming in, you know, eighteen years old and they're old enough to vote and whatever, but I don't think that that was his motive.  I think that he was just outreaching to, you know, a community that is often ignored, so that was interesting.
Speaker 2: So this dinner featured Bobby Kennedy and--
Speaker 1: Right.  It was a big, they had representatives.  There was one student, well there was just, it was a whole community of people, you know, just people probably from all over the city, 'cause it was in a big, you know, huge stadium or whatever, so they had crowds from everywhere, but they also had a representative from all of the local universities and Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas], of course, was the African American university that was represented and that was it, but it didn't hit me until afterwards that, wow, that was--that was pretty recognizable.
Story_ID: 304693
Speaker 1: Lyndon Baines Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson], was he there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no.  I don't remember him being a part of it at all, just President Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy], well he was not president at the time, but his brother Bobby [Robert F. Kennedy], and Bobby was the one who roamed the campus [of Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas], you know, just in a very comfortable position.
Speaker 1: Now, Lyndon Baines Johnson, signed the Civil Rights Act in 1964.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Many people look back on his presidency.  It's been the most productive in terms of securing black rights.
Speaker 2: I would say that, I vouch for that.  He--I think Kennedy was the thinker.  He was the brains behind--he was the brainchild, I think, behind some of that, but I think it was Johnson who carried it out, you know, based on what you've heard orally, in terms of what each of them contributed, but if you read the history of Lyndon Johnson, you can see that in his early years, when he started out, I mean he was relatively poor.  He started out as a teacher in a very poor predominantly Mexican school [Welhausen School, Cotulla, Texas] and so he saw, you know, all of the shortcomings that they had and that's one little school compared to, you know, predominantly--I should say white schools.  I mean, they had nothing and so I think that really had a major impact on him and he, I think he used that, that experience, to recognize the need for civil rights.
Speaker 1: Okay, so was there a sense of him being for civil rights in Texas in those days when you were a teenager?
Speaker 2: I don't remember that.
Speaker 1: Did adults ever talk about it?
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember Lyndon Baines Johnson coming up at all.  I mean, we just, you know, you had to focus on the person that was the most visible and that was John F. Kennedy.
Speaker 1: Well, in Texas itself, I mean, he's--Lyndon Johnson was a powerful senator--
Speaker 2: I know. He was a powerful senator and that was all that you heard, that he was a senator.  You rarely got information about the impact that he was having in that--in that leadership position, you know, the nuts and bolts about what he was doing to bring about change.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there wasn't a lot of discussion about Lyndon Johnson.
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  You just kind of knew that he was there but nothing, which is true, I guess, about a lot of senators today.  You know they're there unless they're--you know, among the most popular or making drastic changes, and that's how they get visibility.  You don't really, you hardly know that they're there anymore, which isn't any different.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's the senators who make the most noise, I guess, who get the recognition.
Speaker 1: Okay, of course Midland, Texas is close to where you grew up, but that's what became home of Bush [President George Walker Bush] (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  Midland, Texas is where my mother's [Netta Thomas Porter Sims] two brothers lived after they left Pelham [Texas], and so I spent time in Midland as well, visiting them in the summertime and eventually, when my mom and dad [William Porter, Jr.] separated, my mom moved to Midland, you know, and stayed near her brothers.
Story_ID: 304694
Speaker 1: What else happened on Texas Southern's [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas] campus when you were in college?
Speaker 2: Well, let's see.  In terms of, you know, my--any recognition that I got, let's see, I think I was called, I was recognized by the dorm to be sort of the queen (laughter) of the dormitory for the year that I was there, I think it was my sophomore year, and so it's the sophomore recognition or whatever is that. And I got in certain plays or whatever, where I didn't have to make any, I was just there, so I was never, so you were in a play where you were just a figure, not necessarily a person who has to remember lines, so I did a little of that by invitation, whatever.  Oh, and then I guess other things that I remember was, you know, things like being called to determine whether you were a potential candidate for the sit-ins or the civil rights kinds of activities.  And I remember vividly attending one meeting and being asked some questions or whatever about how you felt about things, how would you respond to certain things, and then when there was some simulation of what might happen to you during one of those sit-ins or whatever, how you would respond to it.  And I think I was one of those persons who was not willing to turn the other cheek (laughter), so I was not considered, which was probably the best thing for me anyway.
Speaker 1: Do you think that had something to do with being brought up in Pelham [Texas] instead of--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.  It was my background from my parents [Netta Thomas Porter Sims and William Porter, Jr.] and grandparents.
Speaker 1: So when you grew up in Pelham, I mean, I've heard people tell stories of growing up in the South, including Texas, where white people are coming down the sidewalk, you've gotta get off the sidewalk, and--
Speaker 2: Oh, I remember that, I remember that, absolutely, walking--my first memory of that was through my grandfather [William Porter, Sr.], my father's father, and, you know, we had gone to Hillsboro [Texas], and we were walking down the street and we were going around the corner to the car to where my grandmother [Sarah Porter] was waiting for us and this didn't have any meaning to me until that particular moment, in walking down the sidewalk and, at that time, of course, you know, my grandfather was supposed to, you know, move to the side and let white people pass and I remember, and he was just dead set in the middle of the sidewalk and the people expected him to move over and he refused, and I thought, you know, what is this about.  I did not understand what that was about until he explained it to me and I said, wow, you know, that was neat.  He didn't move (laughter).  So, that was really clear in my head and I said that's the person that I want to be.  I want to be like that.  And my mother clearly was like that.  She was, my father was a little more of a, probably more of a mediator than my mother was, even though my mother had a quieter personality.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So in Pelham, you weren't exposed to a lot of the things that people (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.  We were not accustomed to that.  We didn't really bow too well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I would say that that was a common thread among all of us who grew up in that community.
Story_ID: 304695
Speaker 1: Now, you came out in '61 [1961]?  Sixty [1960] (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I graduated [from Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas] in '60 [1960].  I graduated in '61 [1961].  I was the class of '60 [1960], but I graduated in '61 [1961], because I dropped out, so my sister from Tennessee State [Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial State University; Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], who was at Tennessee State at the time could graduate, because we had reached the point where financially we, it was, one of us had to drop out, and then the money that I had coming in, which was from one of my, to support that last year, was from my moth--my grandmother's sister who was a teacher, and she was diverting her money to something else.  It was all a loan, it was a loan, it was not a gift, so she had to divert her money to something else that was going on, and so I had to make a, we had to, I had to make a choice as to whether I was gonna try to hang in there and my sister would not graduate because the money would have to be shifted to her, so since she was coming out, I decided, okay, I can drop out for a while and then start back, and that's exactly what we did.  She graduated and I came out a year later.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, what did you do for that year that you dropped out?
Speaker 2: I worked.  I worked for a year doing all kinds of odd jobs, babysitting, I worked for a nanny, not for a nanny, I worked as a nanny, getting public jobs was pretty difficult and if you did, I mean you were, I'd work as a bus girl and I did all kinds of little things to make money, but I had that opportunity to work as a nanny for those months that I was out of school.  It was a very wealthy family and they treated me very well, very supportive of what I was trying to do.  They recognized why I was there and it was going to be something that was very temporary and so they really, you know, they were extremely supportive of me and paid me twice as much as I would have been able to make if I had been working in the public sector at some little odd job, you know, like a bus girl or whatever (laughter).
Speaker 1: Was this a black family or a white family?
Speaker 2: It was a white family.  They had grown, both of them had grown up in New York and moved to Texas and, you know, they were extremely wealthy.  They had a maid, they had a full-time maid, a full-time butler, and I was the nanny, so that's the story.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. So you did that and you worked these jobs for about a year and then went back--
Speaker 2: Right. Then I went back to school and graduated.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you came out in '61 [1961]?
Speaker 2: Sixty-one [1961], um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 304696
Speaker 1: Well what did you do after graduation [from Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas]?
Speaker 2: Stayed at home for the summer, and then I moved to Chicago [Illinois] immediately after that.  Had some relatives here and they encouraged me to come and live with them--Eloise Cornelius, do you know her?
Speaker 1: No, I don't think so.
Speaker 2: Professor--she's a professor, she has a Ph.D. in social work, worked at University of Illinois at Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] for a while, and then she had cousins here, so they really basically adopted me (laughter), to tell you the truth.
Speaker 1: I think I met her, or heard of her.
Speaker 2: You probably remember Terry Hynes [ph.]?
Speaker 1: That sounds familiar, too.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.  So, and see, they were, they were all born in Corsicana [Texas].  Their parents were born, so they grew up in that area, so we all knew each other's families.  So they embraced me when I, they encouraged me and embraced me in Chicago when I first came and two weeks after I arrived, I was teaching in the public school.  I started out as a substitute teacher in Morgan Park High School [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: I believe I was the only African American at the school at the time.
Speaker 1: When did you start full-time?
Speaker 2: The same year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Same year, 1961.
Speaker 1: Was that at Morgan Park, too?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  That's where I started as a substitute teacher, right, and then--that was at the high school level, I was working as a sub at the high school level, and then I ventured.  I took some more courses so that I could teach at the elementary level and so I, you know, taught at a neighborhood school called Caldwell [Charles P. Caldwell School; Caldwell Math & Science Academy, Chicago, Illinois].  That's where I spent the rest of my teaching years, teaching eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you taught how many years altogether?
Speaker 2: I think it was nine altogether--nine or ten years altogether.
Story_ID: 304697
Speaker 1: Well, how did you like the teaching experience?  I mean, did it, did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I loved it.
Speaker 1: --what you learned at Texas Southern [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas], you know, was it anything--
Speaker 2: Could I sort of (unclear)--
Speaker 1: --yeah, could you transfer it to Chicago [Illinois] (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yes and no.  Of course, I did my student teaching at a neighborhood school that was within walking distance of the university, and it was considered one of the more accelerated schools, I guess, in the Houston [Texas] area for African American students, so I had a wonderful, wonderful mentor there who helped me walk through and get the best of what that school had to offer, so when I came here, and then of course at Morgan Park High School [Chicago, Illinois], the student body was, you know that was just ideal student body, really, and then transferring to Caldwell [Charles P. Caldwell School; Caldwell Math & Science Academy, Chicago, Illinois] it was a different story.  You had a few more challenges there, but I would say the kids were less of a challenge than having to deal with the Board of Education [Chicago Board of Education] and its rules and regulations, 'cause they have their, the board develops its own curriculum and they have rules and regulations about how you're going to, you know, implement, you know, all of the teachings that are required to meet the guidelines of that--those curriculum, so there was little opportunity to work with a varied group of students and although my--the eighth grade classes were departmentalized in that each teacher, there were five groups of eighth graders and each teacher had a specialty and every teacher had to teach reading to his or her own class, and so my specialty was the language arts component, and so with that many students there, you know, five classrooms of eighth graders, you had, you know, quite a range of abilities among the student body and they were divided based on test scores and what not, and so usually I worked with the students who were struggling the most, and they--you certainly had a few more challenges and I think the students were more streetwise; you know, streetwise for being--having grown up in a more urban environment than what I had experienced, so that was a challenge.  But, I loved it, though.  I really loved that particular challenge.  In fact, I still have--I still run into some students, you know, even today on the street.  They recognize me and I have to, you know, look twice before I can recognize them and often they'll say you're one of the best teachers I ever had.  'Cause I was a tough little teacher, you know, very, very tough little teacher and maybe that had to do with Pelham [Texas], because you set an expectation, you know, and that's where you want them to be; but, again you have to start where they are and then move them to where you want them to be and, for the most part, you know, it was a really good experience, a good experience.  So, eventually I became frustrated, you know, with board rules and regulations and whatever that would require you to work, infuse a curriculum a different way that was not possible for the student body that you were working with, so I just hung it up for a little while (laughter) and became a full-time mother again, which I--which is what I had done in the early stages, you know, when the kids were little (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now--
Story_ID: 304698
Speaker 1: When did you get married?
Speaker 2: I got married in 1962.  I had been here [Chicago, Illinois] roughly a year when I got married.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how'd you meet your husband [Donald Duster]?  What's the story?
Speaker 2: I guess you could call it a blind date of sorts, because the person that I lived with, Ms. Cornelius [Eloise Cornelius], introduced me.  She knew the family and so she kind of like introduced us.  We, so it was kind of a blind date.  So that's how we met.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So you got married in 1962, and then--
Speaker 2: Right 1962, December 1962.
Speaker 1: What did your husband do for a living?
Speaker 2: At that time?  He was working for a utility, Commonwealth Edison company [ComEd] at that time when I first met him.  He stayed there for a number of years and eventually left Commonwealth Edison and then he went for a not-for-profit organization for ten or twelve years or so, something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, he's now retired.
Speaker 1: And how many children do you have?
Speaker 2: Three children.  Three children.  A girl [Michelle Duster], first born, and then two boys [David Duster and Daniel Duster] after that.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, the other story in this, you were teaching nine years in public schools, gotta be--
Speaker 2: Roughly.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  What are--
Speaker 2: I was a stay-at-home mom.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm. I was a stay-at-home mom when the kids were very little.  That was my choice.  I did not want to work and leave them with a babysitter, so I chose to be a stay-at-home mom, and it was not until the little one was either, I think it was kindergarten when the lady next door, you know, retired and so she became really the mother of my kids every day, and then I stayed--right after I left the Public Schools [Chicago Public Schools (CPS)] altogether, I think I stayed at home for another year or two or so, maybe another year or two, and then became very involved in volunteer work.  One of the volunteer positions that I had was working with minority high school students to try to get them interested in becoming physicians because during that time there just very few African Americans who were going to medical school and we didn't feel that the schools were preparing them, you know, not only through exposure or the curriculum to get them to move in that arena, so.
Speaker 1: This is in the early '70s [1970s], right, we're talking about?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  That was in the early '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: And what organization is this trying to (unclear)?
Speaker 2: It was called Chicago Focus [Chicago Focus for Women: Black and White], and it was an organization that was put together by Eleanor Petersen; Eleanor Petersen of Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois], a very liberal, very visionary person, and she brought this group of, what we said, blacks and whites together to try to bridge the communication gap between the two groups and so we met on a periodic basis, talking about racism and other things and heard speakers and whatnot and some of, many of us became friends; in fact, I still am very close friends with some people that I would never have come in contact with had it not been for that organization, but we also were active in some ways; in fact, we boycotted Marshall Field's [Marshall Field and Company] (laughter).
Story_ID: 671366
Speaker 1: We had become very much aware that Marshall Field's [Marshall Field and Company] did not have any African American models or faces in any of their catalogs and virtually no recognizable African Americans who were, you know, in sales positions behind the counter kind of people, let's just say visible.  There may have been other people in other parts of the store if you were not recognizable to shoppers, let's put it that way.  And so we, there was a group of us who, and it was a combination of blacks and whites, who decided to, you know, just picket, so we picket at the store.  I mean, I didn't even do that in the South.  I mean, I came to Chicago [Illinois] and ended up on a picket line, but--
Speaker 2: This is part of the Chicago Focus [Chicago Focus for Women: Black and White]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  That was the group.  And so, that resulted in our not only encouraging them to make African Americans more visible in their catalogs, but hopefully encourage them to hire other people on the floors who were visible, not just the person who was cleaning up or whatever; but, we also were able to work with all of the other major stores in the city.  You name them, you know, Carson's and Saks [Saks Fifth Avenue] and Bonwit Teller [Bonwit Teller & Co.], all those stores; I mean, we had a team of people who went out and talked to the president of each of those stores and to try to encourage as well as support them to move in the same direction that we were trying to get Marshall Field's to move in, and I think we got some really good results from that.
Story_ID: 671367
Speaker 1: The other part of that was to identify institutions, you know, like the Chicago Historical Society [Chicago History Museum, Chicago, Illinois] and, you know, the Art Institute [Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], whatever, to have African Americans on their board of directors, some utility companies and whatever, so we went on a letter writing campaign and also met with a number of people including the president of some of those institutions to try to change all that, so Commonwealth Ed [Commonwealth Edison]--I think it was [HistoryMaker] George Johnson who was the first person who was on the board of directors, and that group was basically responsible for making that happen through dialogue, pretty much, and a lot of the women, particularly the white women, were wives of very, very prominent people in Chicago [Illinois].  So, one or two were reticent about doing that because they thought it might have an impact on their husband's position, you know, in that arena, so a few of them were reluctant and wouldn't put their names to certain documents, you know, for fear of repercussion.  So, that was, it was interesting but it was also fun.  It was extremely challenging and it was history making, basically.  It was history making, and so some of the people in the group, I mean, like Gloria Bennett, you know Lerone Bennett's wife, I mean people like that who are very active and visible with that group, so we feel that we were the trailblazers in the instruments behind making some of that happen.
Speaker 2: That Chicago Focus [Chicago Focus for Women: Black and White] was from what year to what year, would you say?
Speaker 1: It was formed in roughly about 1968, and pretty much dissolved about 19--in the early '80s [1980s], maybe '81 [1981] or '82 [1982], something like that, um-hm.  We thought that we'd sort of accomplished our goals, you know, and so instead of, you know, being organized or remaining organized, officially organized as a group, we sort of splintered off and people, particularly Caucasians who were a part of that group, really played a major role in seeing that African Americans became parts of different boards or whatever.  Sometimes they started off as members of women's boards because, at that time, there were not that many women, period, who were boards of directors of organizations, be they not-for-profit or otherwise.  So that's kind of where it started, and I think that's pretty much the way I started, you know, in the arena of doing volunteer work outside of my own community.  It was through the influence of people who were part of that group.
Story_ID: 671368
Speaker 1: Now, to backtrack a little bit, back to the days when you first started teaching.  What--can you, well, you were there when the Chicago [Illinois] schools were tremendously over-crowded, in the black community, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, oh, absolutely, absolutely.  I mean, there were the Willis Wagons, you know, when I first got to Chicago, I mean there was this discussion about the Willis Wagons, and I had no idea, you know, what the history was, and then of course, you know, that continued even through the era in which my children were in early elementary school.  One of my children, my daughter [Michelle Duster], was assigned to a Willis Wagon for one of her classes, I think it was science in the elementary school where they first attended had a full classroom in quote a Willis Wagon.  And that was one of the schools, it's McDowell School [Mary E. McDowell Elementary School; McDowell School of International Studies, Chicago, Illinois] that's at 89th [Street] and Dante [Avenue], roughly and it had, the students were very high achievers, probably one of the better ones in the City of Chicago, and remained that way for a number of years and all three of my children went there, and their test scores were very, very high.  Teachers were superb, but yes it had a Willis Wagon, I think, it eventually left.  I can't remember whether, I can't remember why, whether the student body, you know, was decreased, or what, but it eventually was removed from, from the premise.
Story_ID: 671369
Speaker 1: Well, what about the 1968 when--well, '66 [1966] when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] came to Chicago [Illinois] was the (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.  That was roughly 1966, or whatever, and we were living where we are now, on Blackstone [Avenue], and there was some destruct--you know, some major destruction of, I guess, 87th Street or whatever.  There were some little riots along there, whatever.  But, for the most part, I mean, we all recognize that, you know, when those riots took place on the streets and there was some destruction of stores and other things that if it were African American-owned, you know, there would be that sign out there to say--and for the most part, they were not touched.  And then, the whole that King was in Chicago and, you know, the response, the negative response and the riots that occurred during that time, that was racism as I had never seen it, had never even envisioned racism and the reaction to that kind of activity.  In fact, I found Chicago just to be a really--absolutely racist; I mean, having grown up in the South and then although, you know, we were separated because it was legal, you know, but still, I mean you still mingled in some kind of way.  You shopped, you know, around people all the time and so I never--and there was a friendly atmosphere or whatever, you know.  Maybe I saw a little bit of it after the sit-ins in, I forgot the name, not Walgreen's, but in the fountains or whatever, the sit-ins (unclear) fountains--
Speaker 1: Was that Woolworths [F.W. Woolworth Company]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Woolworths.  You know, then you start to see, you know, some of that, or whatever.  But I remember going in to Woolworths and I remember having to go, not through the back door but having to go to a separate counter.  You could not sit, you know, and that was not--
Speaker 1: Here in (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, this was in Dallas [Texas], after we moved to Dallas, after we moved to Dallas.
Speaker 1: Okay, from Chicago to Dallas.
Speaker 2: No.  When my mom [Netta Thomas Porter Sims]--
Speaker 1: Okay (unclear), this was way back.  We're--okay.
Speaker 2: This was way back--exactly, when my mom and dad [William Porter, Jr.] separated.  Then we moved to Dallas.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, in '66 [1966] King came to Chicago and--now, were you working with the Urban League [Chicago Urban League] or any of those organizations?
Speaker 2: I worked for the Urban League after I left Michael Reese Hospital [Michael Reese Hospital and Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois].  Humana [Humana Inc.] purchased Michael Reese, and when that happened, our whole department was demolished.
Speaker 1: Now this was before, I'm talking about '66 [1966] when King came to Chicago and was--you were working for Urban League (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Was I working at Michael Reese?  No, no.
Speaker 1: Or did you, or were you a part of--
Speaker 2: No, no.  In the '60s [1960s] I was--in the '60s [1960s], I was pretty much, I started at Morgan Park High School [Chicago, Illinois], and then into--well into the '70s [1970s], I was in the Chicago Public Schools teaching (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Teaching and being a mother?
Speaker 2: Exactly, and a mom.
Story_ID: 671370
Speaker 1: 'Cause you have this tremendous resume of volunteer activities.  I just, I mean, it's hard to imagine you did it all in just a few years (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, pretty much, pretty much.  I did all of it, and all of it was just as challenging as any job that you would have and it was, you know, a lot to be learned.  A lot to be learned, and I think some significant contributions, you know, from people like me who go in and volunteer their time and make a real, I mean, make significant contributions in terms of the way an agency might be run to diversify, staff, diversity, you know, the board or whatever, and I always felt that that was an obligation that I had, you know, and I always found a way to make that happen.
Speaker 1: Do you have any stories about those days and some surprising twists and turns with--?
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.  You always have, you know, people who are in very high level decision-making positions, or whatever, leadership positions at these boards, or whatever, and there's a tendency, and sometimes a combination of things.  It's the person who has clout for one reason or another, whether be it money, you know, or whatever.  So, there is that tendency to always, if that person has more clout I should say, you know, that person is one who is listened to the greatest because of whatever that position is, so you always run into that, and that was very, very disturbing to me.  So, finally, eventually you learn how to work within it and then go through--you take the hard knocks for doing it but you find another path to take to get around to accomplish whatever it is that you want to accomplish and then, because, I think because of my background, my family background, and then the experience of working, you know, with an integrated group [Chicago Focus for Women: Black and White] of people, you learn how to dialogue with them to get them to understand that they have to see things a little bit differently and once they see it differently, then you're able to accomplish certain things, because oftentimes they want to do it themselves, but don't want to take the initiative because there's more repercussion if they do it versus them working through you to make it happen.  So that's one of the things that you learn when you're working in that arena.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a familiar story down south and in cities on the Gulf Coast and in Memphis [Tennessee] and places like that where business community would like to change but can't do it.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  You have to find another route to take rather than a direct route where you are on the path to do it.  But I think everywhere I have worked, you know, doing volunteer work, there's always--I always sort of recall the movie with Cicely Tyson, I can't remember the name of the movie; there was a Mrs. Boatwright, a white woman, who--
Speaker 1: Oh, that's 'Sounder.'
Speaker 2: 'Sounder.'  You know, my stu--I brought that to my students any number of times so explained to them, you know, how it was and what can be done, and then you know, the boy had to go away to school, and then there was Mrs. Boatwright, you know, who was the good person.  She was a white woman who was in there and she was the, I mean, she stuck her neck out a couple of times to do the right thing, and there's always a Mrs. Boatwright or Mr. Boatwright in some instances (laughter) who will just take the right path and do the right thing.
Speaker 1: It's not easy.
Speaker 2: No, it's not easy because they are, they sometimes are really, because of the position that they take, it's jeopardizing their standing in the community or, you know, the chance of being isolated and ostracized and, you know, criticized and all those things because of a stand that they take.  So, and I can understand why many are cautious about doing that, but I love trailblazers.
Story_ID: 671371
Speaker 1: Do you have any stories about '68 [1968] when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] died?  Chicago [Illinois] and all that, the communities were (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not really. When he died?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, I just remember--
Speaker 1: Do you remember where you were when you heard it, that he died?
Speaker 2: Where, I'm not sure where I was when I heard it.  I just remember where I was when Kennedy was shot, but I think I was watching television or something when I heard that King had been shot.
Speaker 1: Well, was Dr. King a big deal, you know, in terms of, well, you know, now we have the King holiday and all that, but in those days was he, in the circle that you were in was he as big a deal, high profile person, I mean as someone you all saw as a leader?
Speaker 2: I never had a chance in direct contact with him nor anyone, except [HistoryMaker] Andrew Young, I think, you know, and Julian Wilkins [Julian B. Wilkins].  You know, some personal contact with them.
Speaker 1: Where were--
Speaker 2: Just in a small setting, whatever, but nothing that was like an ongoing relationship or anything like that, but I admired them, you know, for what they did, 'cause I just thought they were very daring, very daring people, you know, to take the stands that they did and to continue that kind of momentum, you know, in the midst of that kind of chaos and threats.  That was very brave, very brave to do that.
Speaker 1: Do you have any stories associated with the day he died and the situation--
Speaker 2: Daley [Richard J. Daley]?
Speaker 1: No, not Daley but--we may get started about Daley a little later, but Dr. King in '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: There was a lot of disruption here in the city, riots, (unclear).
Speaker 2: There was a lot of disruption and, as I said--
Speaker 1: I don't know if you were out of school when it happened.
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.  I just remember, I don't remember, you know, every part of it but I know our neighborhood, 87th Street, you know, there were stores that were, the windows were broken and whatnot, but I basically watched a lot of it, you know, on television when I really wasn't eye-witness to any of it, but it was very scary and it just should have dawned on me that, you know, this is racism at its worst.  I don't think I've ever seen anything, not even the Klan's [Ku Klux Klan, KKK].  I mean, they were not, I mean the people here who behaved that way toward Dr. King, and thereafter was racism that I had never seen or heard of before.  It was that deep.
Story_ID: 671372
Speaker 1: The Chicago Board of Education, were you aware or involved in efforts to change the curriculum?  I know there have been many efforts to try to change the curriculum, and to change school contracts, too--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --the black community has been engaged in an ongoing struggle.  We've known that for a long time (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right. Yeah--no, I was never involved in any kind of activity to change the curriculum.  That was just--that was a very difficult thing to do, but, you know, as a classroom teacher, you can always find ways to deviate or, I wouldn't say circumvent, but it is to deviate and, you know, and get around some of the expectations or requirements of the curriculum so that you can meet the needs of all the children in your classroom, because if you follow the curriculum that has been designed for you for a specific age group and you're dealing with, you know, you're assuming that that age group is supposed to be at the eighth grade level, but they're reading at the fifth and sixth grade level, you know, you cannot--you cannot use any materials at the eighth grade level, because that way the children are working at their frustration level and that's a disaster, so you have to move back to where they are, fifth or sixth grade level, and start where they are and then move them with an expectation that this is where they're going to be, so sometimes you have to work around the curriculum, and sometimes break the rules, you know, in many instances to meet the needs of the children, because you cannot, a child is not going to sit in a classroom and be exposed to material that is at his or her frustration level every day, and at the same time, you cannot keep them and exposing them to material that has a fifth grade level when you've gotta test them at the eighth grade level.  So, you're caught, you know, in a really tough situation in a lot of instances so you have to figure out how to get around that if you're gonna, if you take these children seriously.  I did a little of that, too.  I'd go back and forth, depending on what was necessary to move the children, and I don't think I ever had one who didn't move from point A to point B.  And I didn't mind taking that--I didn't even consider it a risk; really, I just thought it was a necessity in order to meet their needs.  I was never challenged by it because you're working, you know, basically, in isolation in your classroom without any day-to-day oversight about, you know, are you following A, B, and C, you know, in the curriculum, you know, so--but I was, I was never challenged in any kind of way for that, that--
Story_ID: 671373
Speaker 1: So in the '70s [1970s], you start this--all this volunteering, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The volunteer stuff?  Right.
Speaker 1: --and there were so many things.
Speaker 2: The volunteer stuff.  Oh, my goodness.  Yes, I was, I volunteered a lot of my time.  We, I'm trying to think of, Focus [Chicago Focus for Women: Black and White] was probably one of the most significant ones-- I started, you know, women's boards, or whatever. Then I think one of the most critical areas was United Way--United Way/Crusade of Mercy [United Way of Metropolitan Chicago].  I think it was at that time.  I started with the Women's Division--
Speaker 1: In '83 [1983], you were--
Speaker 2: The Women's Division? Right, and basically writing letters soliciting funds or whatever, and then gradually moved up to some, you know, higher leadership positions, and then once I became the chair of the Women's Division, that division was made up of primarily, you know, fairly wealthy--fairly wealthy, white population. I think I was the only, you know, African American there, so I was in a position where I could make some changes there to reach out into a broader community, which I did, and was very successful at that and then I ended up serving on some committees at the United Way board level on some of those subcommittees and eventually chaired several of them, and that led to a position as a board member at the United Way, and that opened up some other challenges and opportunities as well, to make some differences there.
Speaker 1: So this is at 1983 we're talking about (unclear) United Way (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Roughly, the early '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: And before that you were like a--you were manager of community relations for Michael Reese [Michael Reese Hospital and Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois] from '82 [1982]
Speaker 2: Right. I was manager of community relations for Reese from '82 [1982]--I was there for seven years. Eighty-two [1982] through '89 [1989], I think.  I loved that position.  I loved it.  I loved working at the hospital and I loved the challenge of working in the community, trying to build--build as well as sustain relationships, you know (laughter), in the community.  I think the first challenge that I had, I think I had been there maybe, oh, I don't know, maybe a month at the most or something, and the hospital was in the, in a position where they were limiting the number of Medicaid patients that they were accepting.  You know, once they reached whatever that percentage was, you know, they would not accept them and I suppose I could understand that decision, but anyway, there was a boycott, not a boycott but a--picketing.  Some of the neighbors were picketing in front of the hospital and that was--it was relatively calm, but nonetheless, it got a lot of attention because the hospital is one of the largest in the area, and so I was challenged, you know, how to deal with the general public, to minimize that, and so that was a challenge.
Story_ID: 671374
Speaker 1: I think, fortunately, I had just finished, I think I'd just finished doing the graduate work in communication science, so I think that helped a lot, yeah I think that really helped a lot (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Where was this one at?
Speaker 1: I did that at Governors State [Governors State University, University Park, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I did that at Governors State.  I had wanted to go to Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] because I had sort of narrowed down how I--what I wanted to go into following education and so I could sort of merge everything in my interests and communication science was one of them, and Northwestern had a program, but at the time I could not afford Northwestern, so I compared the two--you know, the two schools in terms of class content and also did sort of compare the professors and I discovered that Governors State, almost--almost a hundred percent of their professors were Ph.Ds from Northwestern, so I thought, okay, maybe this is the answer.  I can have the benefits of Northwestern's students, Ph.D. students who were teaching the classes, and then learn the same thing, so that was really my rationale for choosing that to kind of get over the tuition, which was pretty heavy for me at that time.  So, it was a great learning opportunity.  I loved that program.  So, I think that provided some more knowledge in order for me to, you know, develop different communication mechanisms to deal with a crowd like that, and to make sure that they were getting the message appropriately to diminish, you know, their frustration for that happening, and that also involved, you know, working with some of the elected officials in that area, one of whom was Alderman Barnett [William "Butch" Barnett], and then we finally came together and I think he was a little apprehensive (laughter) about (unclear), and I had another mentor who was working for the City of Chicago [Illinois] who helped me, you know, sort of merge into that arena and Alderman Barnett became extremely helpful.  He was just very, very helpful; in fact, I still stay in touch with his wife [Esther Barnett].  She's just a very, very resourceful helpful person, you know, who really schooled me about the 2nd Ward [Chicago, Illinois], and then [HistoryMaker] Bobby Rush came along.  Barnett was, you know, he had lost his position with Rush exceeding him and then one of the first things that I did, too, when Rush was elected was to go meet with him so that we could find ways to work together.  He was extremely receptive, and we stayed close, even to this day.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. That was a very challenging position, very learning position to see how, how integrated institutions, et cetera, neighbor- can work in a neighborhood harmoniously.
Story_ID: 671375
Speaker 1: You went to National Louis [National Louis University, Chicago, Illinois], too.  Did you get another graduate (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right. Human--management of human resources, and then I took a whole bunch of other education courses in administration at National Louis, and that was prior to my going, well prior to and then even including the years that I was at the Corporate Community School [Joseph Kellman Corporate Community Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois], where I started.   Following the year after I left the Urban League [Chicago Urban League], I became the assistant principal at the Corporate Community School.
Speaker 1: Okay, now put some years on that for us (laughter).
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Put some years on these for us (laughter).
Speaker 2: I think that was 19--let's see, I left the Urban League in about '89 [1989], I think, and then I started that, I left, I was at the Urban League for slightly less than two years, and then I went, I went to visit the Corporate Community School by way of a friend, because I was, you know, didn't know anything about it and met the principal, and I think it was two weeks later.  I mean, I was just going to look at the school because I was working on an education project.  I was in the education department when I was at the Urban League running a program called SMART, which is an acronym for Science, Mathematics, and Advocate for Teaching [ph.], and so I wanted to look at their school to see what they were doing because it was a non-public school, to see if they had any innovative programs there that I could utilize some information that would transfer to the students that I, who enrolled in that SMART program.
Speaker 1: Did you find anything that impressed you?
Speaker 2: I went--well, I went to visit and just took a tour of the school and met the principal and a couple of teachers, and then maybe two or three weeks later, the principal called me and told me that they were going to add an assistant principal position there and wanted me to come over and talk to them about it.  That's how I got there, and I kind of ignored it for a while.  I thought, ah, I don't want to go back in a school yet.  But anyway, they were pretty persistent, and eventually I said yes and I started there as an assistant principal.
Story_ID: 304709
Speaker 1: Okay. So you became the assistant principal at the Corporate School [Corporate Community School; Joseph Kellman Corporate Community Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I became the assistant principal at the Corporate Community School, and then the principal, you know, left and then I became the principal of the school and stayed there.  I was there for five years combined, combined five years.
Speaker 1: Describe the Corporate Community School for us.  It's--now that was downtown, right?
Speaker 2: No, it's on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois], right next door to Manley High School [Manley Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: I was over there one time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right next door to Manley High School.
Speaker 1: The children, I mean the students wore white shirts and ties?
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.
Speaker 1: Dark slacks and--
Speaker 2: Right.  There was a dress code and that was it.  Um-hm.  So, but no, it was a school.  They don't--they didn't like to use the word model, but it basically was built to model certain kinds of techniques or whatever, and other aspects of education within an institution, to take children regardless of where they come from and then move them to another level of experience, and so they, the kids were selected from a specific boundary on the West Side, and they were all accepted based on how they fell in the lottery in the grade, you know, that they were going into.  It was a small school.  It started out, I think it was maybe through third or fourth grade and it gradually moved to eighth grade, you know, taking in a year, a grade every year or whatever, but when I left it was just over three hundred students, about 325 or thirty [330] students there; that included four year olds all the way through eighth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you were there for, you said four years?
Speaker 2: I was there five years including both positions.
Speaker 1: Five years. And what years, from when to when?
Speaker 2: I think it was, let's see, '89 [1989], right after I left the Urban League [Chicago Urban League].  That's why I left the Urban League to take that position; '89 [1989] through '94 [1994] or '5 [1995]? Ninety-four [1994] or '5 [1995].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  The overall, overarching, I guess, purpose of the Corporate School, or the theme behind it was that I think it was a corporate philosophy, you know, or was it, I mean there are so many corporations, actually put (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, it was supported solely by corporations including all of the biggies that you can name in the Chicago [Illinois] metropolitan area; I don't know if you want me to name a few of them or not.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: It included McDonald's and United Airlines, what else, IBM [International Business Machines Corporation], you know, all of the biggies that you can name that are kind of at that level; very, very strong corporate support.
Story_ID: 304710
Speaker 1: And it [Corporate Community School; Joseph Kellman Corporate Community Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] was actually, really is the brainchild of [Joseph Kellman], what's his name, I can't recall his name now, but he was the one who envisioned, you know, the concept of the school and put a lot of--he used to own Globe Glass [Globe Glass and Mirror Company], I'm trying to think of his name and his name is escaping me, but he was the visionary person behind that school and pulled a lot of his own resources to get it started, and then he was also instrumental in getting and maintaining the support from those corporations to invest in the school, and initially they, most of the larger ones had made a five-year commitment to the school, and when I was there, I guess in the sixth or maybe going into the seventh year of the school, and so many of them thought that they couldn't continue to make that contribution at the same level that they had met their original obligation, and so the board and the staff--it was monitored by a board of directors--had to come up with some alternatives for the school and it included everything from closing the school to turning it into a private school, you name it, so it eventually was taken over by the Chicago Public Schools [CPS], and so we went through--actually the last year that I was there we were engaged in almost a year-long dialogue with the public schools, you know, at the administrative level to incorporate the merger of that school into the public school system, and that's what happened, and then I didn't want to go back.  I didn't want to go back, reverse myself, you know, because I was offered that position, but I chose not to take that position.  It was--I didn't want to go that route again, back into the public schools.  So, anyway, I left there and became the executive director of WITS, which is Working In The Schools [Chicago, Illinois], and I was there for, I don't know, a year-and-a-half or so.
Story_ID: 304711
Speaker 1: WITS? W-I-T-S (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) WITS, W-I-T-S, it's an acronym for Working In The Schools [Chicago, Illinois].  It was founded primarily by Joanne Alter [Joanne H. Alter], who was a very active politician, and she was involved with the Water Reclamation [Metropolitan Sanitary District; Metropolitan Water Reclamation District of Greater Chicago] for a long time, so she and another person [Marion Stone] founded the organization.  The idea was that they would engage volunteers to work primarily in the Cabrini [Cabrini-Green Homes, Chicago, Illinois] schools as tutors and mentors, and then it really grew beyond that so that, you know, the program for the volunteers as well as the students, changed dramatically.  I mean, when I first got there, I really added a lot to it, you know, training for the volunteers by experts, you know, who knew how to deal with children both academically, emotionally, et cetera, so that was one of the principal things that I was able to do, and then move to a larger location, so, you know, but anyway, we--I guess we're not as compatible as we could have been in order to--for me to maintain a comfort level there.  So, anyway, I stayed out for a few months and then ended up with the position that I have now, which is under the bureau of Cook County [Illinois], I should say Cook County--not Cook County Hospital [Cook County Health and Hospitals System], but so I run a pediatric literacy program there working with children ages six months through five years to introduce literacy to them while they're waiting for their doctors' appointments and also working with the parents during that same time period so that they can learn the importance of literacy by way of introducing books to the children, reading to the children, and so forth, and also model reading techniques to them and giving them some guidance as to how to choose appropriate books for their children and then how to manage their children while they're in the process of interacting with them, and so forth.  It's a wonderful, wonderful program; it's very time-consuming, tiring energy-wise, but I really like working that program.  It's kind of like, it's like maybe in my retirement phase, or whatever, but it's something I can do that I think is giving back to the community.  I can contribute whatever expertise that I have in that area and then help somebody, you know, move along the way that's going to provide a better path for them.
Story_ID: 304712
Speaker 1: Let me backtrack a little bit to the [Mayor] Harold Washington days.  We didn't cover that and we didn't go back to that--
Speaker 2: No, we didn't.
Speaker 1: But 1983, now were you--how were you involved in the Harold Washington campaign?
Speaker 2: Just, you know, as any other person would be.  I remember some friends and I got together and held the first, really official, gathering of Harold Washington in her house.  She was living in the South Shore [Chicago, Illinois] and had one of those very sizable houses, so we called all of our friends and we pooled our money.  We pooled our money to make that happen, and it was just overflowing, so that was one of the initial involvements that I had with Harold Washington, and it grew from there, just do little bits and pieces as a volunteer to make it happen, so that was very rewarding.  As I said, I mentioned to you I had some interactions with him when I was working community relations at Michael Reese [Michael Reese Hospital and Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois], and so, you know, we got to know each other really well through those encounters and then, when the decision was made to put a foundation together, which was following, well, it really became--well it was during his last months there when it was put together.
Speaker 1: In 1987?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm, so it was working really well.  It got a lot of recognition, you know, several events were held that were very successful, and I think the important thing for me was that, you know, when you're asked by the mayor, you know, to put--to be a part of something like that that's so significant, that is the reward in itself, and then you know exactly your purpose there, why it's, you--the purpose of the organization and an opportunity to generate revenue, to support activities that he felt so strongly about.
Story_ID: 304713
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I think education is the center of all of it.  I think education; if you don't embrace education and find, develop some tools by way of education to help you manipulate through, which is still a society that diminishes our gifts; as African Americans there is little else opportunity to do it--to be successful in an arena.  If you look at corporate America, it hasn't changed.  I have a friend who always tells me when I'm frustrated about something when I don't see a diverse population where I think it should be, and she looks at me says, "You know what?  Nothing has changed since the march, don't you get it?"  (Laughter) So, I have to laugh at that every time, but I'm always hopeful that is going to happen, but I think for our young people the education is the key and the schools really have not changed drastically to meet the needs of those children and to give them the tools that they need to move through society in a very successful way.  So, I think that's it, you know, and I think that we have to develop some ways to minimize negative exposures by way of different communication vehicles that perpetuate negative behaviors because young people are going to eventually emulate what they see and what they hear.
Speaker 1: What they hear on television, radio?
Speaker 2: Exactly.  So I think that we're going to have to develop some more positive images out there by way of whatever communication tool is available, whether it's television, whether it's music, or whatever it is, we have to change that to a more, you know, change those, you know, I call them communication vehicles; all the tools in which communication takes place.  We have to change that.
Speaker 1: Okay. Do you have a--what's your major critique of popular culture in that regard, you know, is it--?
Speaker 2: I think, I think that on the positive side, that is it gets recognition.  On the negative side is that it is--it doesn't influence, I think, young people in positive ways, which I think are necessary for them to make sound decisions about themselves, about relationships, about communication, you know, how people communicate with each other, how they communicate outside of their own little worlds.
Story_ID: 304714
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently now, I mean, or then?
Speaker 2: I can't think of anything right away that I would, that I would do differently.  I think everything that I've done, I've been really pleased with it, proud of it, and have my children, you know, they don't pay much attention to it (laughter) anyway but in instances where I will share some experience with them, hopefully they are proud of the way that I've done it, and hopefully they will learn from some of my mistakes as well, you know, through various experiences to meet different challenges themselves, you know, to make a difference not only in their lives but other peoples' lives as well.  All of my children are very, all three of them are very social conscience, or whatever, very attuned to what's happening in the world and make minor ways--I should say minor contributions to try to maintain some stability among the races to interact with people in a way that brings harmony to people and to, you know, to try to make a difference out there.  If you see something that looks wrong, and there's something that you can do make it right, make that chance, take it.  Now, and always you know, when opportunities arise where you can serve on a board or whatever, and you may, and oftentimes in almost all the instances that you are aware of where I've been a volunteer, in many of the instances I was the only, or the first African American, you know, in those activities.  United Way [United Way/Crusade of Mercy; United Way of Metropolitan Chicago], for instance, I was the first woman, maybe the only woman, I'm not really sure, but I know I was the first woman who served as a vice president of the board, and I saw I was able to utilize that position (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is in what--when was this in--?
Speaker 2: That was in the '80s [1980s].  That was all in the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm. And other organizations, not-for-profit organizations, I've been on the board of Chicago Child Care [Chicago Child Care Society, Chicago, Illinois] for thirty years and I've been the only African American who's ever served as president of the board, so just little things like that where things just won't happen unless you, or someone like you, you know, with similar goals or similar thinking, and willing to the risk to change things, and it's not that hard in a lot of instances.  You just have to be persistent about it; persistent and take advantage of any opportunity to change that, to change that environment so there's neither all-black or all-white or whatever.  But particularly where things have been closed because of racism or whatever.  You have to, I think you have to go in and just try to make a difference.

Speaker 1: Now, you are related, that's a good way to segue into this, 'cause you're related through marriage to Ida B. Wells.
Speaker 2: Right.  I'm married to one of her grandsons [Donald Duster].
Speaker 1: Right, right, and she was like one of Chicago's [Chicago, Illinois] all-time champions, well, the country's all-time champions of justice, a real crusader for justice.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.
Speaker 1: What has that legacy meant for your family?  I mean it should be--people talk about their ancestors and they talk about what that means and people pour libations, and they have discussions about history and the family, but when you ask them about Ida B. Wells is actually in the family, does that have a--?
Speaker 2: You know, surprisingly, there's not a lot of talk about it within the family itself.  I think most of that, a lot of that discussion takes place that is external to the family.  My children recognize, you know, that legacy, or whatever, but they don't dwell on it at all; they really don't.  You know, they rarely--they rarely even mention it and most people, unless they know it already, won't even know.  The name is an odd name, so, you know, the Duster is an odd name, so practically anyone who has that name is pretty much a relative, especially in Chicago.  I don't even know how many people in the whole country with that name, but it's very odd, very odd name.
Speaker 1: Right, it's not, you don't hear it much, no.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No.  So, I mean but they're friends or whatever; they don't really pay any attention to that.  It's not something that they dwell on, and hopefully I make a contribution to that.  You know, okay, that's your name but you have to be you.  You have to make your own world.
Story_ID: 304716
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done up to this point, again, what would you consider today to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: My legacy?  Oh, hopefully my legacy will be my involvements with various organizations, institutions and where I have left the organization through my work more sensitive, more diverse, and more, I should say diverse but inclusion is synonymous with that, but hopefully opened their eyes so that they could see things a little differently.  That's always something that I want to do.  If I can't do that, if I'm banging my head against the wall, and I see no opportunity whatsoever to change the way people behave and the way they perceive things, the way we respond to things, I'm in the wrong place, totally.
Story_ID: 304717
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything that we haven't asked you that you think we need to address before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Oh, (laughter) your last question.  Is that gonna be a biggie?  (Laughter) Oh, I can't think of anything.  I think you've covered, you've covered a lot of territory.  You know, sometimes I wonder, what have you done, Maxine [HistoryMaker Maxine Duster], to get recognition?  But, I don't think about getting recognition when I'm doing something.
Speaker 1: You've received some major awards now.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: Anybody that sees--I mean from what I've read in materials and stuff--
Speaker 2: But I never think about it.  I do it because I think it's something, I can make a difference.  That's why I do it.  I never, it's like, you ask me how well I did in school, or whatever, from the early years.  I never thought about, you know, doing well.  Just go in and do what you can do.  Do what you're capable of doing, and then if it makes a difference, you know, maybe you get recognition for it and maybe you don't, but I don't ever remember going into anything because I was seeking recognition; in fact, I don't like, you know, I don't like too much recognition.  I'm kind of a low-key person (laughter).
Speaker 1: This leads to this last question, which is similar to legacy and--ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's a tough question.  How would I like to be remembered?  A person who, who was always thinking about how to make change, how to make a contribution to change people's lives, one person, several persons, or whatever, but trying to pave a way so that others can take advantage of whatever opportunities are available within that arena, that whatever I have done to pave the way, be it my children or others, can go in and use their gifts and their talents within that arena and get, hopefully if they want recognition, if they deserve recognition, they could get recognition for it, but basically to help them move to another level of experience and meet whatever goals and opportunities that are afforded them.  That's what I like to do.
Story_ID: 304718
Speaker 1: We were talking about the way people perceive themselves, black people perceive themselves in Pelham [Texas] as being different from the way black folks perceive themselves in other small towns and--
Speaker 2: Exactly.  That was not only true then, but I wasn't as aware of it then as I am even today.  People who live outside the community will see, you know, one of us in another neighborhood or in another small neighboring town or whatever, and you kind of think they stand out for some reason or another; for instance, when my father [William Porter, Jr.] died, and he was murdered, we were there for his funeral, and so we went into some of the neighboring towns, you know, to take care of business and whatever, and almost everywhere we went, people would say, "Oh, are you from Pelham?"  You know, and we would say, "Yes."  "Oh, you're a Porter," you know, and they know nothing about you whatsoever.  I also remember when my sisters and I were in a neighboring town trying to, you know, complete some business where we had to go into some legal documents or whatever, and we had gone to a restaurant afterwards and we were having lunch there and people were kind of, you know, looking and staring at us and wondering, well, who are they or whatever, and finally one of them came up and said, "Are you from Pelham?"  And we said, "Yes," and said, "Oh, we knew you were from Pelham," or something like that.  They didn't know us from, you know, I had no idea who these people were; they certainly didn't know us.  So may--I don't know what it was; it could be the way we carried ourselves, maybe we were a little more confident (laughter), maybe a little more daring.  I don't know what it was, but it was certainly, it was something about us that identified us from other people in neighboring communities or whatever.  It could be because we were, I don't know, it's hard to tell because if you were an unfamiliar face, you could be from anywhere, but one of the first questions that they would ask, "Are you from Pelham?" or the comment, "You must be from Pelham."  So that was, and that still happens.  It still happens today.
Speaker 1: And then you indicated that its stake-holding and ownership may have made the difference.
Speaker 2: It made you more confident?  Absolutely.  That was probably it; not only confident, but the background that you had to bring you to that level of confidence that perhaps you exuded without knowing it.
Story_ID: 304719
Speaker 1: Now, you went to school at, they called it Pelham High School [Ash Creek School; Pelham High School, Pelham, Texas]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Exactly.
Speaker 1: Now, who was the principal there?
Speaker 2: When I was there, it was, his name was Davenport [W.P. Davenport].  We called him Professor Davenport.
Speaker 1: That was the same school that Professor Carroll [Zeno Carroll] founded (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right the same school where my parents [Netta Thomas Porter Sims and William Porter, Jr.] were under his tutelage, I guess you could call it, and Professor Carroll was, I mean, just had a widespread respect for the man that he was.  It's my understanding that he exuded brilliance, he was a very confident man and I also understand that he spoke Spanish.  I don't know where that was from, but he had some characteristics that him stand above the crowd and it's also my understanding that he set expectations for those students that made them rise above the norm and be confident in who they were, and I think Davenport, I don't think had all of the same characteristics.  The one thing that I remember about him that he was extremely resourceful in bringing resources, you know, to the school that perhaps other schools that may have been as segregated as we were, you know, to have us have different exposures.  We had different speakers who would come to the school, you know, to enlighten us about certain things.  We had to listen to a certain kind of music, at least once a week, or whatever, so that we could learn that something existed other than what we heard on the, you know, through the radio with sometimes one station that you would be exposed to or whatever, and we also had other teachers in there who introduced us to different kinds of music, different kinds of literature.  I had a teacher who taught me English and she also was fluent in Spanish.  I think she grew up around Seguin, Texas, which is right near the border of--the Texas/Mexican border, so she was very fluent in Spanish, so we had that kind of exposure as well, so that may have been rare, but I think a lot of things that were in that community were not, they were unique to that community rather than it being the community rather than it being the norm in all communities.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And Professor Davenport, who was the principal when you were there, he was, he was a good manager as you would say.
Speaker 2: Oh, a very good manager.  As I said, he was extremely resourceful and had a lot of respect, you know, within the school district so that he could garner resources through that respect when, maybe other schools wouldn't have those resources available.
Speaker 1: And it was a competitive thing, I suppose, for a black community since we had a segregated school system, but they still depend on state money, and so forth, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely, absolutely; and, you know the dollars that are available for a black school were not comparable to that, or another example was the school bus (laughter), you know.  We had our school bus eventually.  I don't remember how we got it, but, you know, we used that bus to get around to different towns, you know, to play basketball, softball, and other kinds of activities.  We participated in lots of academic competitions and whatever.  I was kind of like the speller (laughter), which I guess is a part of the English that I liked a lot so, you know, I was always the person who represented the speller in those contests, and my sister that I mentioned was always the athlete, you know.  She was pretty much that.
Story_ID: 304720
Speaker 1: There's one other thing I wanted to ask you.  I think we covered it, the part--the missing gap there.  But you mentioned your father [William Porter, Jr.] was murdered, and I don't think we talked about it at all (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  We didn't cover that at all, and I'm not sure that we had an opportunity to bring that up, but he, along with his brother, who lived, you know, just a few, maybe half a mile at the most from him in Pelham [Texas], were murdered on the same evening.  This was in 1988, I think, and he was murdered by an individual who was familiar with the community but lived outside, you know, in one of the neighboring communities.  He was either twenty or twenty-one years old.  I think he was twenty at the time, and he murdered my uncle, and then decided that my father would recognize him because he had seen his car there, and so he came back late in the night and murdered my father--bludgeoned both of them to death on the same evening.
Speaker 1: What was there, was there any reason for this?
Speaker 2: Money.  He had come for money from, to get money for my uncle.
Story_ID: 304721
Speaker 1: That was in the home of the person that I was living with [in Chicago, Illinois], Eloise Cornelius, and it was immediately following my wedding to Donald Duster, who is on the left, and the date was December, 22, 1962.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA SPEAKER):  Oh, it's your anniversary today.
Speaker 1: It is my anniversary.  How about that?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA SPEAKER):  Okay, next photo.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: You're going to be in trouble if you don't (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, tell me when to start.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA SPEAKER):  Go ahead.
Speaker 1: Those are my three children, all adults.  That's the youngest child on the left, that's Daniel [Daniel Duster], my one and only daughter, Michelle [Michelle Duster], in the middle, and David [David Duster], on the right.  Michelle is number one child.  David is number two, and Daniel is number three.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA SPEAKER):  Okay, next.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's a picture of a small number of relatives who attended a family reunion, so they were all gathered up to go on a hayride and that picture was taken in Pelham [Texas], where we've had most of our family reunions.
Speaker 1: That is a picture taken of a tombstone of my paternal grandparents, William [William Porter, Sr.] and Sarah Porter.  It's in the cemetery where almost all of my relatives are buried, and we were there for our family reunion, so we were all gathering additional history for the young people, so that they could get a better flavor of their ancestors.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA SPEAKER):  This was taken when?
Speaker 1: That was, oh, about maybe 1990 or something like that.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA SPEAKER):  Right, next. All right. Go ahead.
Speaker 1: Okay, that is a picture of my mother [Netta Thomas Porter Sims] taken in Dallas, Texas.  She was about sixty years old and so that really just kind of captures one of her pensive moods.  I thought she was a very beautiful woman, and she was a very pretty woman.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA SPEAKER):  Great, next.
Speaker 1: That is a picture of me when I first arrived in Chicago [Illinois].  It's taken out on the lake [Lake Michigan].  Perhaps I was in a pensive mood, wondering about what was in store of me in the City of Chicago.  It was windy.  It was a very windy day.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA SPEAKER):  Next.
Speaker 1: It reminds me of a scene from the 'The Birds.'
Speaker 2: Yeah, (laughter).  Okay, that captures me upon graduation from college, Texas Southern University [Houston, Texas], in May 1961.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: That's my father on the left.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA SPEAKER):  What's his name?
Speaker 2: William Porter, known as W.M. Porter [William Porter, Jr.], and that is one of our cousins on the right.  That was taken in Pelham at a homecoming event in the late '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA SPEAKER):  Okay. Next. And description, please.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of my daughter, Michelle, when we were visiting our grand--my grandparents on the farm there so that she could have a sense of what my life was like as a child, and she was just visiting the whole territory, trying to figure out what the land was like when I was growing up, so the horse was an experience for her so that she could get a flavor of it.  She was about ten or eleven.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: This is a picture of the church where I grew up.  It's also the church where my parents and grandparents, and perhaps maybe some great-grandparents also went, so it's still standing and it looks very much the same.  It hasn't changed drastically.  That was taken in the fall.  The summers where things are greener, it's absolutely beautiful.
Speaker 1: That's the United Methodist--
Speaker 2: That's the United Methodist Church.
Speaker 1: Wesley United Methodist?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Wesley United Methodist Church [Pelham, Texas].
Speaker 1: Jacob H. Carruthers, Sr. was (unclear).
Speaker 2: Exactly and he always came there and visited us often, and that was where he spent his time.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: That is a picture of a marker.  It's a historical marker that identifies Pelham and its history, origins, and maybe mentions some one or two of the people who were the founders of the community.  It's one of the few communities in the State of Texas that has an actual historical marker, so that's pretty significant.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: The picture of my father, known as W.M. Porter.  He's sitting in the front of the yard where he lived at the time and where I was born and grew up, so that was my territory as a child (laughter).
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA SPEAKER):  Okay, next.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of my mother's father, Daniel Bedford Thomas.  I don't know exactly how old he is, but I was told by mom that he was around, between twenty and twenty-two years old.  He was also born and grew up in the community in Pelham.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA SPEAKER):  Description please.
Speaker 1: That is a picture of, me on the far right, and all of my siblings, all five of my siblings were to my right; to the far left is Alma [Alma Porter] with her identical twin, Norma [Norma Porter]; child number one Carole [Carole Porter]; my one and only brother, Darnell [Darnell Porter]; and my sister, Evelyn Ruth [Evelyn Porter].  Evelyn is now deceased.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA SPEAKER):  Okay, next.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's me at the end of my--one of my teaching years.  That is about 19--oh, '76 [1977] or '77 [1977].  Something like that, or maybe earlier, I can't remember (laughter).  It's in the '70s [1970s], when I was a teacher at the Caldwell School [Charles P. Caldwell Elementary School; Caldwell Math & Science Academy, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA SPEAKER):  Go ahead with your description.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's me, the tennis player in the middle, trying to make a point to some tennis pals.  I did a lot of tennis playing up until about five or six years ago.  I used to play quite a bit of tennis, including park district tennis.
