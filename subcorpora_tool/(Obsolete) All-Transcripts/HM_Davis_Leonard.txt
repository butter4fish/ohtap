Speaker 2: What do you know about her history, her family tree, her growing up in Fisher as a little girl?  Did she share any stories with you about what her life was like as a child?
Speaker 1: What her life was like as a child?  Well, of course, she grew up as a--with a, a mom [Amy Moody Shepherd (ph.)].  She had a mom as a single parent.  And my grandmother worked as a domestic for a family in the South, Louisiana, white family.  And she pretty much was gone at the--my mother stayed with, with my--her aunt, my mother--grandmother's sister, Susan, Aunt Susan [Susan Moody], and so then Grandma sort of went back and forth and kept up with her as well as with her, her job, and, and the house and kept everyone going from her occupation, and--yeah (simultaneous).

Speaker 1: Okay.  So, do you know--you--so, what did your mother do for a living?
Speaker 2: Initially, my mother had come to Washington [D.C.] during--after World War II [WWII].  There was an initiative for people to come to either--I guess to Washington or California.  I think she had the option to go to either, so she chose to come to Washington to work I think at the war department [U.S. Department of War].  I'll have to find out.  But, initially, she had gone to college from home in Southern University [Southern University and Agricultural and Mechanical College] in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: And what year did she go to Southern University?  I mean, I know it's funny, you're talking about your mom when she's--

Speaker 1: --sitting right here, but these are all the questions we ask in the oral history to help get a sense of who you are.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, she went to Southern University--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --during what years?
Speaker 2: What year would that have been mom?  Like in the '30s [1930s]?  Thirties [1930s]?

Speaker 2: Was it--
Speaker 1: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS): Home economics.
Speaker 2: --home economics.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then who did she work for?
Speaker 2: At that time--well, she didn't know--she didn't actually work until she ended up coming (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Into--
Speaker 2: --to Washington.
Speaker 1: --Washington.  And--
Speaker 2: Yeah.

Speaker 1: During the war--during the war, it's--
Speaker 2: During the war.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: World War II, you know.  So all the men were gone--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and the women came, came through, had to fill in, you know, a lot of the, the, the jobs.
Speaker 1: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS):  I lived at that time with my mother in Na- Natchitoches, Louisiana.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS):  We moved from Fisher to Natchitoches.
Speaker 2: So she lived with her mother.
Speaker 1: She lived with her mother (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Her mother.
Story_ID: 505602
Speaker 1: What's your mother's--[maternal] grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Amy Shepherd [Amy Moody Shepherd (ph.)].  Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And do you know your grandmother's date of birth?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  I don't really recall the--
Speaker 1: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS):  September the 24th.  I don't remember the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, September the 24th, but, but exactly what year--
Speaker 1: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS):  I don't remember, but she was ninety when she died.
Speaker 2: Now, was she born free or was she born a slave?
Speaker 1: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS):  No, she wasn't--she was born free.
Speaker 2: Free.  She was never a slave.
Speaker 1: Free.  So she was born probably at the turn of the century like the late--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --eighteen hundreds [1800s]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: The 1890s?

Speaker 2: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS):  Natchitoches [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: To Natchitoches.
Speaker 2: To Natchitoches after they--well, initially--
Speaker 1: How do you spell Natchitoches?
Speaker 2: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS):  N-A-T-C-H-I--
Speaker 1: N-A-T-C-H-I--
Speaker 2: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS):  --T-O-C-H-E-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You'll have to--
Speaker 2: Natchitoches (laughter).
Speaker 1: Natchitoches.
Speaker 2: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS):  They tell me it's a little Indian [Native American] town.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, is there any Indian in the family that you know of?
Speaker 1: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS): Could be.
Speaker 2: Could be.  Some part of the family--the, the--on my mother's [Cleo Williams Davis] side, the family name is Moody and something that I read at some point, if, if you would see the, the relatives back, they, they look sort of East Indian-ish.  And, and many--because I traveled to India a lot, I know that the--at the turn of the century, a lot of East Indians had moved--had, had--you know, had migrated to America and the Modi family changed their name to Moody which was a more American sounding name than, than Modi.  But, but, you know, I, I, I don't have a lot of evidence of that.  It was just something, a curious tidbit that I heard one day and sort of thought back, you know, to, to the family to found out, you know, various people changed their name from Modi to Moody.
Speaker 1: To Moody.
Speaker 2: And they were East Indians, so, I'm like, okay.
Speaker 1: How far back have the--has--how far back has the family's history been traced?
Speaker 2: Okay, now I have photographs of my great-great-grandparents.  My great-great-grandfather--
Speaker 1: What was his name (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) which is mom's grandfather--what was his name?  Gus Moody [ph.].  And he worked on the--well, like a--it's sort of a chain, like the, the, the railroads, but, you know, they'd have to follow the railroads as you would fix a track or do something and then they would get a crew together to do some--to lay track, but then that would end and then you'd have to find another site, you know, and do--and work there for--you know, and send, constantly send the money back home to your family to care for you family.  Typically, you would either--the men would either find work following the, the train track, you know, or a saw mill, you know, and then after they would cut down all the timber in a particular area, that would be that.  They would strike camp and they would move on to another site, and then if you wanted to go to Kentucky to the next site, you know, wherever the next site was, you, you would go and then you'd have to send money back to your family and that--very often, that's how a lot of people--
Speaker 1: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS):  They were--they, they mostly ended up in the small country place (unclear) town but it was called Fisher [Louisiana] where I was born.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS):  Fisher, Louisiana.
Speaker 2: Fisher, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So, can you hold on just a second?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS):  Long Leaf Lumber Company [Louisiana Long Leaf Lumber Company] was there.  It was a saw mill and, you know, it, it--logs, trees were brought there and milled, you know, turned that into lumber that was shipped everywhere.
Story_ID: 505604
Speaker 1: So let me just ask you, just one question about your childhood, how--what are your earliest memories of your own childhood growing up in Fisher [Louisiana]?  What do you remember?
Speaker 2: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS):  I remember--I can remember how I used--I could not go out to play outside of a fence we had so I would be able to follow them around, which my uncle had a--just a huge area and we, we couldn't call it farming, but it was gardening.  And we raised, you know, all kinds of vegetables and watermelons, all of this.  And I would follow the children who were able to go outside of the fence, I was able to follow them around in the fence.  You know, I was there.  My mother [Amy Moody Shepherd (ph.)] at that time worked in Natchitoches [Louisiana] and--
Speaker 1: Nac- Nactus- ?
Speaker 2: Natchitoches.
Speaker 1: Natchitoches, okay.
Speaker 2: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS):  I just spelled it for you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS):  And she would bring toys, you know, at that time, little pots and pans, you could cook.  But the majority of children didn't have all of that so they were just happy to come and play with me (laughter).
Speaker 1: She would bring those from where?
Speaker 2: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS):  Yeah, from Natchitoches.
Speaker 1: Okay, but from the family, you know, where she was working?
Speaker 2: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS):  Yeah.  She, you know--
Speaker 1: They were toys from the domestic job she's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS):  (Simultaneous) Natchitoches was the little town.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS):  Not like Fisher who had one commissary that had, you know, market, groceries, things to wear--
Speaker 1: So, let me ask you this.  Who made your clothes when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS):  My aunt, my mother's sister, Susan [Susan Moody].  Her oldest sister, Susan, could sew.  Then, they had this old fashioned machine, you know, where you turn (laughter)?  And she would make all of my clothing, all of it.  And I have pictures on the wall in there where I had some underpants that, you know, (unclear) out (laughter).  And she was so proud of me, but she practically raised me, my aunt did.  I looked on her as my grandma because my grandparents had died--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS):  --(simultaneous) when I was born.
Story_ID: 505606
Speaker 1: So let me ask you about your father.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And what you know about your father and his side of the family.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So your father's full name?
Speaker 2: Jordan Davis [Jordan Davis, Sr.].
Speaker 1: Date of birth?
Speaker 2: Date of birth, August the 15th, 1930.
Speaker 1: And his place of birth?
Speaker 2: Danville, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what did your father do for a living?
Speaker 2: Initially, my father worked at a cleaners in Virginia that he acquired the skill for tailoring.  And with that, then he came to live with his older brother in Washington [D.C.] and got a job as a valet at the--
Speaker 1: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS): Ambassador--
Speaker 2: --Ambassador Hotel [Washington, D.C.], working there.  And, you know--you know, obviously, this is during the period of the--
Speaker 1: Segregation.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: During the--go ahead.
Speaker 2: Well, no, fashion-wise where men wore suits exclusively every day and so, you know, your suits were constantly in, in need of repair, tailoring or if you bought a new suit you, you had fittings, you, you know, all of that kind, so he was there working at a large major hotel and every major hotel had their valet shop there for the gentlemen to come in and bring their suits, have them either cleaned or repaired or refitted or something or you could have a suit made because it wasn't that common that you would walk into a place and buy a ready--there was no such thing as suits on the rack, so if you wanted a new suit, of course you'd have it tailored, so that's what he was doing.
Speaker 1: So, do you know much about African American valets during that time?  Was it co- was it a--were, were they all generally black?  Is it a job that were exclusively mainly black men or where there white valets or it was--you--how did that--do you know anything about valets during that era?
Speaker 2: There--well, okay, so we, we, we--let's get the words right.  You know, so we're talking--val- a val- a tailor, okay, for what it's worth would've been the person that is actually with the skill of sewing and actually crafting your suit, okay.  The art of tailoring requires that you would know a variety of different stitches.  You have to make buttonholes by hand and the collar, all of the tacking and everything is all primarily done by hand, so a lot of variety of different stitches are required, tailoring, okay.  Valet on the other hand is actually a person who has the skill to repair, okay.  So, so that's kind of a different person whereby it's a person that can help you, can assist you who knows how something should fit, a, a, a suit that's already made, I'm just saying, to re-fit a suit that doesn't fit you quite right or to repair a tear so that your--
Speaker 1: That would be the valet.
Speaker 2: A valet.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At a hotel or at a dry cleaners.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, when you would bring your suit into the dry cleaners and that person would just have the skill to either clean, repair or, you know, re-fit a suit that you--that you have, okay.  So they, they have to have the--sort of the tailoring background, but they're not the full tailor who's making the suit initially.  Now, our father did have the skill for both, but he was actually working as a valet.  To answer your question, so, no, it was not common for blacks to be tailors because that was skilled labor, okay.  So blacks would more likely have been a valet, which what in today's terms be an assistant tailor.  That's as far as you could hope to get.
Story_ID: 505608
Speaker 1: Now how did he get the job at like an exclusive place like the Ambassador Hotel [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: That--from what I recall that he had told me, he came up--his brother had helped him to get the job there, had some influence, having lived in Washington [D.C.] already, had some influence, and took him down there and helped him to get the job at the hotel.  He had the skill and just needed somebody with some connections to get him in there and he proved himself and he--now, that's, that's where he also--he--
Speaker 1: Met.
Speaker 2: --met my mom [Cleo Williams Davis] because my mom was an elevator operator.
Speaker 1: At the Ambassador?
Speaker 2: At the hotel.  And my father [Jordan Davis, Sr.] was working.  So as the hotel guest, the gentlemen would bring their suits to the valet shop, to the cleaners, valet shop to be whatever, okay.  Then, he would do the work which--that was necessary and then bring their suit up to their room, so he quite often took the elevator, and so that's how they sort of met and, you know, the rest is history.
Story_ID: 505609
Speaker 1: So, do you know anything about your father's [Jordan Davis, Sr.] mother and father?
Speaker 2: Yes.  So, my grandmother is Emma Davis and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Date of birth? Do you know her date--
Speaker 2: And date of birth, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't rec- I don't quite, quite remember her date of birth.  And my grandfather's name is Walter Davis.
Speaker 1: Davis.  And what did they do for a--for a living?
Speaker 2: My grandfather worked at--in, in Danville, Virginia, the main commerce there is the cotton mill, okay, the huge cotton mill that's there, you know, manufacturers.  Dan River cotton [Dan River Mills, Danville, Virginia], it's, it's a--it's a well known fabric company, Dan River cotton.  So, he worked at the cotton mill.  During that time period, which is interesting also, the dust, the dust from the cotton, from the, the--you know, the--no one wore mask and all--and then ultimately, you would get sort of like a black lung from the cotton dust over a period of time and most of the people who--in that town who, who died eventually died from black lung, but of course for that time period, you know, such precautions weren't taken and, you know, no one was paying attention to that kind of thing.  So it wasn't until years later that people started to acknowledge that that was, you know, a problem.
Speaker 1: And did that happen to your grandfather (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: And your--okay.
Speaker 2: Now, my grandmother, she worked--she worked--okay, mom's [Cleo Williams Davis] telling me that she--grandma also worked at the mill.
Speaker 1: At the cotton mill.
Speaker 2: At the cotton mill.  But then she worked for a brief time because I think she also--she, well, had a large family, ten children, so, so she was busy (laughter) between perhaps working but at home as well with ten kids.  I mean, having one after another kind of, you know, so she was kind of busy at home as well, but anyway, but they sort of shared the responsibility between the two of them.
Speaker 1: Now, were there any other people in the family that worked within the fashion industry and that--I mean, your father was a valet, your grandfather worked at cotton which was the fabric, Dan Rivers.  Were there any other people that were somehow connected to fashion even on, you know, loosely as in fabrics or, you know, valets?  Your [maternal] grandmother [Amy Moody Shepherd (ph.)] made clothes, made clothes for your mother.
Speaker 2: Well, my aunt.
Speaker 1: Your aunt, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Great--my great aunt--
Speaker 1: Your great aunt.
Speaker 2: --made, made clothing for, for mom.  Not, not that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not that, that I can think of at the moment.
Speaker 1: So--
Story_ID: 505610
Speaker 1: What are your earliest memories of growing up in D.C. [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: So, so in Washington, we started off in a small house as my parents, you know, first began, humble beginnings, and then they struggled.  My father [Jordan Davis, Sr.] actually was working three jobs, driving a taxi, he was working at the hotel [Ambassador Hotel, Washington, D.C.]--he was driving a taxi, he was parking cars at a parking garage and--during the day and then he began working at the post office, so he was kind of really hustling out there and--to really make ends meet.  And, and so from our smaller apartment where we first began, we were all like pushed in there together, then we finally, you know, got our first house.
Speaker 1: Still in Washington?
Speaker 2: In Washington, yeah, uh-huh, in Washington.  And so we--let's see, we--I, I went--so, as, as we moved, I wasn't of school age at the time that we moved.
Speaker 1: Right, so--
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: --during the time when you're still not of school age, do you remember who babysat you during the day?
Speaker 2: A variety of different people.  Typically--initially, we were home with mom [Cleo Williams Davis] until she suddenly started working.  She started going for nursing training at--which hospital is that?
Speaker 1: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS): St. Elizabeth [St. Elizabeths Hospital, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: It was St. Elizabeths Hospital it was called in Washington.  And so once she started going for nurse's training, and it was at night, so, so, then either my mother and father would take turns as his schedule allowed in the day and then she was working at night, and they were going back and forth, and then in between, they would hire babysitters to, to, to keep up--you know, keep up with us, you know, if, if neither one of them was going to be there, you know, in the evening or something, so there was always someone there, you know.
Story_ID: 505611
Speaker 1: Do you remember who were the neighbors on either side of you during--when you were in the house in Washington [D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, on the--let's say facing the house, let's say, okay, so to the left was Pauline Jackson [ph.], her name was, and she had two sons.  And to the right, we--there's a--it's row--a row of houses, like connected houses and then there's an alley.  And then the second part, the other half of the street, they're all single houses, you know, with, with more land around them or whatever.  So there's--okay, we, we moved to the neighborhood, the community where we moved to, in the early '50s [1950s] and so this was that time period of what they call white flight, okay, as we were moving into--well, blacks were moving up, you know, middle class blacks were moving up and trying to move into better neighborhoods, those that could afford to or just had the ambition to want to live in better conditions or not in, you know, the ghetto as it were.  And so, therefore, moving, then, you know, whites were moving out to the suburbs.  And so, so, I say all that to say that, so, so living to the right of us was the last of the Mohicans, Miss Ellis [ph.], okay.  And, and she was--and--well facing the house, she was to the right.  So, but, but she lived there until she died, actually, which was I think like in the '90s [1990s] or so.  But everyone else, all the others, you know, one at a time, the other white families that were there around us when we first initially moved, you know, moved out, you know, and so--and they were all kind of replaced with black families as time went on.
Story_ID: 505612
Speaker 1: So, during those early years, did, did you have an eye for fashion before you even started school?
Speaker 2: Not at all (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you look at magazines?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Did you even pay attention to clothing?
Speaker 2: Not at all, no.
Speaker 1: Now, did you even like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not even interested.
Speaker 1: --fabrics or?
Speaker 2: Not, not a--not interested, not a clue.
Speaker 1: Nothing at all.
Speaker 2: Not at all.
Speaker 1: Okay, so where did you go to first grade?  Where did you go to school?
Speaker 2: I went to school, Keene Elementary School [Washington, D.C.], which is in walking distance from our home, which was a very nice school, actually, you know, we--and very nice.  It's not suburban.  It's--I mean, it's sort of like on the periphery of Washington [D.C.], but it's in Washington, but we're right on the periphery between Washington and Silver Springs [Maryland].  And so it's really, really a nice upper middle class community of, of people, calm, conservative, nice, everyday people.  And so we, you know, very quickly formed friendships up and down, you know, the, the, the block with other kids.  Other black families were moving into the community at the same time and so the parents and the kids were kind of all of the same age.  We were all kind of at that same starting point moving up, you know, and having--struggling, you know, just managing to get their homes and hold on to them.  So a lot of people had that commonality, you know, that they were struggling together.  But, but, but, but what was--what, what drew everyone together was the fact that we all wanted more and wanted better, okay, and we're not wanting to, to, to live, you know, in the southeast part of town.
Speaker 1: Now, you were born in 1951, you said?
Speaker 2: Three [1953].
Speaker 1: Fifty-three [1953].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so during the--your early years of school, was Washington--because Brown versus Board of Ed [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] had happened when you were just one year old.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So you went to fully integrated schools?
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Actually, more so than that.  Actually, the truth is that I really--it--hard to believe, but, you know that they call Washington Chocolate City, okay, and so the real truth is, I don't recall being friends with or knowing anyone white until I was out of high school [Calvin Coolidge High School; Calvin Coolidge Senior High School, Washington, D.C.] as far as schooling and friends and up close and personal kind of thing like that.  Every--I mean, it was like a, a full black environment, you know, all around.  It (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It was Chocolate City.
Speaker 2: It was Chocolate City.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  So it was--you know, it was just that kind of thing.  It was a rarity that I would occasionally--you know, we would have to go out of the community to, you know, interact with someone white.
Speaker 1: Well, living in that--in a--in an environment that's 100 percent black.  Do you--when was it that you experienced racism for the first time in a sense that knowing that once you left the community in a broader community that you may be discriminated against.
Speaker 2: See, I guess I wasn't--being brought up in, in a, you know, really black community and not given that sense from my parents [Cleo Williams Davis and Jordan Davis, Sr.] of caution that way, also not given any kind of sense of anger or frustration about, you know, just the, the wisdom to know, okay, fine, you know, everything is not for everybody.  And when Dr. Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was downtown demonstrating, we watched it on the television, we were aware of what was going on, our parents shared with us what was going on and made us--had us to understand what was going on.  However, it was still dangerous to go and participate because as blacks, you still have to think about it.  And this is Washington, federal government, okay, so if you go down there and participate in those marches, you do, you know, take the risk of perhaps losing your job, your livelihood or whatever.  So if your family is more important to you, you know, if you just couldn't take that risk, you didn't.  However, you were supportive kind of from afar, you know, in watching and knowing what was going on.  But we were cautious, you know, as far as, as that type of thing was concerned--
Speaker 1: Did you ever get into any trouble, racial issues that your parents had to come and be a part of (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I- I would only hear my parents as they would go out into the broader community and work and come home and maybe feel that they were slighted in some case because, you know, of some kind of discrimination or something of that sort.  I personally don't--can't recall an incident where I felt that I was discriminated against or whatever because, again, actually I wasn't, you know--you know, doing anything--you know, I mean, wasn't anywhere--I mean, it, it was a whole black community, I mean, so I pretty much was in the community.
Speaker 1: It was self-contained, yeah (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So it wasn't 'til I got out, let's see, of high--in high school, then we started getting summer jobs and then, you know, by going downtown and working in the federal government during the summer, okay, then I started to, you know.  Again, I--I'm not going to say to you that I had an incident ever of a sort, but I was just aware.
Story_ID: 505613
Speaker 1: Okay, continuing.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We were talking about elementary school [Keene Elementary School, Washington, D.C.] and you said that there were no real inspirational teachers during your elementary school years?
Speaker 2: No, I think it was sort of an average, just the average experience of, of elementary schools.
Speaker 1: Well now--well, let me ask you this.  Were you a kid who liked clothing at the time?  Did you--
Speaker 2: Not at all (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) care about what you--
Speaker 2: Not at all.
Speaker 1: --looked like in school?  Well, your mom's [Cleo Williams Davis] shaking your--her head in a different way.
Speaker 2: Not in elementary school.
Speaker 1: But I mean even caring about what you looked like at school.  Were you particular about picking out your clothes in the morning to wear to school?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head).
Speaker 1: No?  Do you remember where your mom purchased your--purchased your clothing at the time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, mom--well usually at J.C. Penney's [JCPenney] and shoes, there was this--Kinneys [G.R. Kinney Company], this store called Kinneys where they would buy shoes, and so we used to go to Kinneys.  Well, I had three brothers, so it's the three of us, so we would all get the same thing all the time, so--
Speaker 1: So, you dressed as triplets?
Speaker 2: No, I'm just saying, we would be taken to the shoe store (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, taken to the, to, to pick out--
Speaker 2: --at the same--
Speaker 1: --your shoes.
Speaker 2: --at the same style.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Same store and, you know, we could pick out--you know, get some shoes. Get some, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you pick out your own clothing, your shirts, pants at the time when you were?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, if we--well, but--well, primarily mom would pick up stuff for us, you know, when she would know is, is new or fashionable or stylish or whatever and say, you know--you know, you guys should be wearing this. And I'm like okay, whatever (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you ever complain about what you wore?
Speaker 2: Not in elementary school level.
Speaker 1: No, okay.
Speaker 2: You know, not at, at that time.  I'm just saying later on.
Speaker 1: Right.  What were your hobbies in elem- when you were a, a child in--a little boy in elementary school?  What did you like to do?
Speaker 2: Just--I was interested in mechanical things, you know, anything that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Such as?
Speaker 2: Trains and--you know, planes and trains and just taking apart a radio and things like that to try to just--trying to figure things out, that kind of thing, curiosity about how things worked.
Speaker 1: What types of books did you read?
Speaker 2: Let's see, mostly comic books, but I think, you know, mostly sort of adventure related type of books of that sort and, you know, mechanical things and music related.  Michael Jackson was, you know--you know, the, The Beatles, Michael Jackson, you know, those kind of things.  You know, so--
Speaker 1: Well, Michael Jackson I'm sure was big for you because he was African American--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you were black, and you--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Around the same age.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, a little boy doing--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did you pay any attention at all to what they wore?
Speaker 2: At that time, just saying, but that's later on (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, not in--not in elementary school, but, but--
Speaker 1: Okay, so then let's move to a time when you did pay attention.
Story_ID: 505615
Speaker 1: Elementary school [Keene Elementary School, Washington, D.C.] wasn't that big of a deal for you then--
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) you're saying.  So junior high school comes next.
Speaker 2: Right.  So, so, now the turning point was in junior high school.  So, for the first year in junior high school, I--
Speaker 1: What was the name of the junior high school?
Speaker 2: Rabaut [Rabaut Junior High School, Washington, D.C.].  I'm sorry, the, the, the high--junior high school I went to from Keene Elementary School, I went to Backus.  It was called Bertie Backus Junior High School [Washington, D.C.], okay, because that was the only high school that was open in the area.
Speaker 1: The only junior high school.
Speaker 2: Junior high s- I, I mean, junior high school open in the area at the time for that one year.  They were building a new junior high school in the area but it wouldn't open until the second year.  So we went to Backus the first--right from elementary school, again, sort of ordinary, you know, not quite eventful other than just the trauma of going to a new school, meeting new people, that kind of thing, trying to get acclimated, you know, and so now I'm suddenly in junior high school, that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: The turning point becomes?
Speaker 2: The turning point was the following year, I went to Rabaut which was the new junior high school, okay.  And so there, they had more classes and crafts and vocational training kind of things.  And so at Rabaut, then, there was a lot more opportunity to be social, to get on the track team.  They, they were a lot more developed because it was a brand new school, okay, so the teachers, everybody was brand new, kind of a satellite kind of school.  So they had a lot of incentives, a lot of really top-notch teachers.  Roberta Flack was my eighth grade music teacher, you know, in junior high school.  She was teaching public school at the time.  So--and she encouraged a lot of people.  And she was on her road to stardom herself but at the same time, she was trying to encourage anyone, any talented person around her.
Speaker 1: What was she like as a teacher?
Speaker 2: She was strict, very strict, very serious about music.  I wasn't.  I was, you know, wanting to have fun like many of, of us were, and pop gum and make airplanes out of, you know, paper and so on, but she was very serious about music and focused, you know, on her career.  So she was trying to encourage anyone that was interested in the theater arts or whatever, that kind of would've been her, you know, her, her baby at the time.  So, so that--it, it--that wasn't my interest at the time, but, but I do recall that she was very serious about music and anyone who was interested in learning about music, okay, as, as an instructor, but she was really great.  So, in any case, having gone to Rabaut, the second school, then I started to develop an interest in a variety of different things, but the opportunities were there to explore different things and different types of kids were there at the school who were more challenging, you know, for me, okay.  And so then I started--then, then that was a better outlet for me with my curiosities about mechanical things and electronic things.  I could take some of those workshop type classes and, and get my hands on mechanical things or whatever.
Story_ID: 505617
Speaker 1: So, leaving junior high school [Rabaut Junior High School, Washington, D.C.], the crowd, the, the, the next--the school for me to go to would've been Coolidge [Calvin Coolidge High School; Calvin Coolidge Senior High School, Washington, D.C.], okay, in my community, okay.  But I chose to go to a vocational high school, so I went to Chamberlain, Chamberlain Vocational High School [Washington, D.C.], and I went there and took electronics, okay, as, as the, the focus, as the major.  The first year that I was there at Chamberlain taking electronics, they had--again, I, I had kind of a surface interest as it turns out in--you know, it's like you want to play the piano and then someone gets technical and goes, okay, here's all the keys and you go, no, I just wanna play.  I don't wanna learn all that.  I just wanna play.  So, it was very, very technical and it was very serious and it was very detailed, the whole electronics thing about learning and I was--and I was like, oh, boy.  So I joined a, a group, the newspaper, the school newspaper journalism group just as, I don't know, something to do.  And what happened was, the instructor who was, you know, heading the group there for the, the school newspaper--and I, I wasn't, you know, wasn't a journalist, but she, she, she challenged us and she said, okay, no one's reading the school newspaper.  What would make this paper interesting?  And so I had an idea and I says, well, a music column, you know, top--the top ten record list would be an idea.  And everybody went, hm, we tried that once before, didn't work.  So my second idea was, what about a fashion column?  Everybody's interested.  These girls around here are all interested in clothing and fashion, what about a fashion column?  Good idea, your baby.  You do it.  Well, I didn't know anything about fashion and I didn't even care about fashion.  All I was trying to do was come up with a suggestion, but now I have this obligation to come up with a fashion column or something.  I didn't even know what it was.  So, I thought about it for a while and then with this sudden interest in possibly being a journalist, I'm searching.  Maybe if I had some fashion photo--pictures or drawings of clothing, I'll write the captions under them, that's how we're gonna do this.  But who's gonna draw the pictures?  So I went to one of the art classes there in the school at Chamberlain, and met a girl named Lynn [ph.].  And so she liked to draw.  She wasn't a fashion designer, she wasn't a--but she was just like interested in illustrating.  So, she would draw these pictures of these girls with their clo- little fashions on, great.  So I begged her, draw a couple of pic- pictures of whoever it is.  I don't care what it is, and then I'll write the caption.  Here's my part.  I'm gonna write the captions underneath the drawings, how great.  So she did it once and I came up with--I said, tell me what this is and she said it's a blazer.  And I says, okay, and with the--and what else should I--and brown and, and it should be with three buttons and two pockets, got it.  She got bored with this very quickly.  After maybe two issues, she was like, "Why are you after my life each and every week to do some more drawings.  I'm bored.  I'm tired of this."  I said, "No, this is my column."  We named our column L and L fashions [ph.], Lynn and Leonard [HistoryMaker Leonard Davis], L and L fashions.  I was so excited with this thing.  And I was like, "We have to keep our column alive."  And she was like, "I'm tired of it.  I don't wanna be bothered anymore."  Well, I wasn't gonna let my idea die.  So then the next week, and the instructor's going, "The deadline is Thursday, get your column in," and I'm like, oh my God, what will I do?  So, I took one of the drawings from a previous week and put it up in the window and traced over it and just sort of changed the color and did something, just made it new.  And then I wrote my caption and I was ready, I submitted it, okay.  No one knew the difference.  I never announced to anyone that she wasn't involved, I just went on with it.
Story_ID: 505619
Speaker 1: Lo and behold, (gesture) this lady [Cleo Williams Davis] saw one of the drawings one time and so she turns around on the front porch to Pauline Jackson [ph.] who lived to the left and goes, "Pauline, look at this dress.  I love this dress.  I wanna have it made."  I'm going, "Ma, will you give me my sketch back?  I gotta turn in my column for this week."  "No, I wanna look at the--."  I said, "Ma, who cares about the dress?  I'm just--gotta do my--I'm doing my column, you know."  I, I--I'm doing my--I'm in the back--in the back room, tinkering trying to make a transistor radio 'cause that's the class that I was in and this was just something on the side.  What is everybody getting crazy over these stupid sketches?  It's nothing.  I'm just trying to write captions under the drawing and keep this column alive that I'm suddenly obligated to do.  No.  Mom kept flipping and she's telling Pauline, "We're gonna get patterns and I'm gonna make this dress because it's beautiful."  Oh, boy.  So, the week after that, again, I had to do a tracing and come up with something and I was--you know, after weeks went by, I got a little more interested in the drawings, tried to make them a little nicer, tried to take the hair and flip it like this.  I didn't know what I was doing, but I was trying to do something.  I was trying to keep my, my column alive and she kept on flipping over the dresses.  And I kept saying, "Mom, stop.  I don't care about the dress."  She said, "But you don't understand.  Look how fabulous this dress is."  So then I started taking a look.  So then the next week I would say, well, don't put two buttons on the dress, put six buttons on the dress and try to make it plaid.  Then I would say, "You like this one?" (Screams) And she was dropping dead every time I would put my pencil on the paper.  So slowly, I started believing, maybe I am doing something.  Maybe I am--maybe it is something, I don't know.  So then I started paying more attention to fashion.  Then, I started paying attention to what people were wearing, what I was wearing, what was going on around me in terms of fashion.
Speaker 2: And what grade were you in?
Speaker 1: That was te- elevent- tenth--no, that was tenth grade.  That was tenth grade, first year of high school [Chamberlain Vocational High School, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Okay, and that--and then how did you end up at Coolidge High School [Calvin Coolidge High School; Calvin Coolidge Senior High School, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 1: So, then, the elect- electronics took a back seat because I became--now, I got less interested in electronics and more interested now in the fashion thing.
Speaker 2: In the column.
Speaker 1: In the col- well, the column which led onto actually drawing clothing and really gain- gaining an interest in fashion.  Okay, now wait a minute.  So, now my mother and father [Jordan Davis, Sr.] are members of the Masons for the men and the Eastern Star [Order of the Eastern Star] for the ladies, that organization.  So they know a vast array of people throughout Washington [D.C.] just from that organization and then, of course, my father is a Mason, he's also a Shriner, blah, blah, blah, you know.  So that--there was a exposure to a lot of people and so my parents being gregarious as they are, are constantly out at meetings where--and bringing us out, okay.  So as parents talk about their kids, you know, at the various events and functions and parties and picnics and outings that we go to, the word got around, you know, that my mother would always tell her friends, you know, he's interested in clothing, he's interested in designing, he's designing clothings.  So, this was in the '60s [1960s] and everybody was wearing, you know, Michael Jackson, you know, the dashikis, you know, big afros, you know, black power, all that stuff.  So then
Speaker 2: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS): (Unclear).
Speaker 1: I was trying to--so then what I did was, I got a--my mom got me a sewing machine and I started making dashikis, making my own dashikis, you know.  You could go and buy African fabric and get creative and make your own dashikis and all of that stuff, so started having fun making dashikis, you know, at home, whatever.  That was kind of my first sewing pursuit.
Story_ID: 505621
Speaker 1: What happened with the column?
Speaker 2: So, so ultimately, I--so, I went to--
Speaker 1: Coolidge [Calvin Coolidge High School; Calvin Coolidge Senior High School, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: No, so I went to--so, at the end of the first year, okay, at Chamberlain [Chamberlain Vocational High School, Washington, D.C.], okay, the column--you know, I was in--I mean, when the school year ended, you know, that was it for the school paper and I came back to Chamberlain the second year, okay, for my next electronics course, which at this point I was really not interested, okay.  I had just suddenly found myself, you know, interested in fashion at this point.  No connection with anyone related to fashion, slowly with mom's [Cleo Williams Davis] friends in the--in the lodge and at church, people started to say, well, well, a lady in particular, one of mom's lodge members, Pauline Elmore, she was a dressmaker and a fashion plate, and another lady, Martha Austin [ph.], and another lady, yeah, and, and there was another--there was--okay, but anyway, mom's friends, the ladies in the lodge whose--who were dressmakers, okay, suddenly embraced me and said, look, if you're interested in learning to make clothing or whatever, we'll help you.  You know, you could come over, I'll show you, whatever.  And so Pauline Elmore, in particular, she sort of, you know, took me under her wing and so that was the first time that I'd ever seen any patterns or knew that anybody was sewing at home or how the thing worked or whatever and I was fascinated.  So, again, slowly, my interests shifted from electronics to this with exposure to someone that had knowledge to share with me about it because, you know, that was my only outlet.  That led to modeling, you know, because, okay, you could also--well, you would want to attend fashion shows.  I mean, if you really wanna know about fashion, now you have to attend fashion shows and then the, the area opens up even broader because now you're there seeing people in the limelight modeling and fashions and this thing and that thing, and so it's, it's, it's like a whole other world that's going on around you and you had no idea, okay.  So then again--
Speaker 1: So you became a model?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  Well, I was in a--in a couple of--I made my own clothing, in other words (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right and you modeled your own clothing.
Speaker 2: And modeled my own clothes--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and, you know--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --but, at, at church [Gethsemane Baptist Church, Washington, D.C.].
Story_ID: 505623
Speaker 1: Your first venture to show your own, your clothing to someone was at a church fashion show (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Church fashion show.
Speaker 1: And what year was that?
Speaker 2: In--that would've been, you know, like mid-'60s [1960s], you know, so mid-'60s [1960s] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was the name of the church?
Speaker 2: Gethsemane Baptist Church [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: And tell me about the fashion show and what you--what you made and what you wore.
Speaker 2: Well, there were two--there was--there were two fashion shows that I can remember.  One was down at the lodge hall, the Masonic lodge, they have the hall, so one, one major fashion show they had there and a lot of professional, city-wide, you know, professional models were in that show and I made some, my fabulous dashikis and came up with some sort of costumes of, of sorts, and I wore that.  And all of my mother's [Cleo Williams Davis] lodge sisters all applauded and told me I was looking fabulous and all that.  And then at the church, we had some fundraiser, bazaar or whatever, you know, slash fashion show slash bake sale slash whatever how they have them at church, and so I was one of the models in that show and rigged up one of my outfits and wore it and had my fifteen minutes of fame over there.
Story_ID: 505625
Speaker 1: But what happened was--so the--so the--so the newspaper thing, you know, fell off to the side at, at Chamberlain [Chamberlain Vocational High School, Washington, D.C.].  The second year was like so boring because I was totally not interested.  I wasn't even getting good grades or anything.  And so on the third year, which is my senior year in high school, I didn't go back to Chamberlain because it, it, it was over.  You know, there was no point.  And so I went back to my neighborhood school, which was Coolidge [Calvin Coolidge High School; Calvin Coolidge Senior High School, Washington, D.C.], the twelve- the final year, okay.  And on that year at Coolidge, now with an interest, a genuine interest in perhaps fashion but definitely art, okay, the art teacher, Miss Snowden, Elaine Snowden [ph.], embraced me and just like Roberta Flack who was at my junior high school [Rabaut Junior High School, Washington, D.C.] who was desperate for anyone who wanted music, okay, Miss Snowden was desperate for, if it was only one out of a thousand kids who really was interested in art, who really wanted to learn art, and so she took me under her wing.  In fact, what happened was, I, therefore, skipped physical ed [physical education] and would take two, two periods of art instead of--you know, because she wanted me there, so--you know, she was so interested and I was so interested and eager.  So I went through all sorts of art projects to the point that I won, we won, the, the national high school art fair or whatever it is for that year of all of the competing high schools that submitted a work of art to this particular, you know, competition.  I won first prize and second prize.
Speaker 2: What did you submit?
Speaker 1: Well, I did, you know, one drawing of an African mask and another large round thing I made out of corrugated paper, something abstract or whatever.  But she was embarrassed actually because all of her other art teacher colleagues were all, you know, talking or whatever and, and was like, you know, they were like, you know, she, she hogged the entire spot because her student, you know, got first and second prize, you know, and she was like--and I was embarrassed because when they called me for second prize, you know, going backwards, she had led up, and so I got the prize for--you know, second prize and then was--and now first prize, and it was like, you know (laughter), I had to come back up again and I was like ashamed.  But, anyway--but I have the photographs from that thing.  You could see, it was like, oh, boy.
Story_ID: 505627
Speaker 1: So, however, Miss Snowden [Elaine Snowden (ph.)] also had traveled extensively and she all started putting the notions in my head, "If you want to go to school for fashion design, you should look forward to New York [New York]," and so I was like, where?  "Yeah, there's Pratt [Pratt Institute, New York, New York], Parsons [Parsons School of Design, New York, New York], FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, New York], think about it.  That's what--."  So, she sort of encouraged me that, you know, further your studies.  You're a senior in high school, what are you gonna do?  You know, think about it.  So I came home, discussed it with my parents, and applied for FIT in New York.  Are you crazy?  You know, leaving Washington [D.C.] and going to New York?  And then my other relatives were like, you don't know anybody up there.  You could get killed, you could get this.  But my mom [Cleo Williams Davis] and dad [Jordan Davis, Sr.] said, nope, if that's what you wanna do, we'll send you.
Speaker 2: How did your dad take to the fact that you were so heavily involved in fashion?  Did--
Speaker 1: He was always--
Speaker 2: --he like it--
Speaker 1: He--
Speaker 2: --or did he not like it?
Speaker 1: He was very supportive.  He was always supportive.  My parents as you can see have always been very grounded and he was one to--that loved to lecture and to just give us a lot of, you know, wisdom and, and sound judgment.  I, I think that the, the--that rearing, you know, process is where--one way if you--if you tell your kids a lot of--I mean, you don't have to torture them or beat them or restrict them, just tell them a lot of things which will somehow or rather resound when the time comes.  So he just gave me a lot of things, you know, would constantly talk and share a lot of stuff, a lot of his experiences with us and just say, okay, fine.  You know, if you ever come into this situation, here's what you, you know, some options for you, you know, that kind of thing, so a lot of that was real helpful for me, you know, moving on.  So that was a turning point in my life leaving high school and suddenly when everybody was doing whatever, I was going to--A, to college, B, to New York.
Speaker 2: Right.  So you graduated Coolidge [Calvin Coolidge High School; Calvin Coolidge Senior High School, Washington, D.C.]--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --in 19--
Speaker 1: Seventy-one [1971].
Speaker 2: Seventy-one [1971].
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And then--
Speaker 2: You started FIT--
Speaker 1: In--well, that--
Speaker 2: --that same year.
Speaker 1: That same year.
Speaker 2: The fall of that year.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Just graduated in the summer or--
Speaker 1: Yeah, and so I graduated from FIT.  So, I went for two years in '73 [1973].
Speaker 2: Okay, so arriving at FIT, were you--did you feel prepared for--
Speaker 1: I felt (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) the fashion institute--
Speaker 1: I felt prepared.  I wasn't, but I felt prepared.
Story_ID: 505628
Speaker 1: And because you within your own circle from wherever you're from, have only that group to compete with, okay.  And if you can rise to the top in that group, then you are soaring, you're, you're great.  And so in the Washington [D.C.] community, I had become familiar with other people in the area who were aspiring designers, dressmakers, primarily dressmakers, people who were just making clothing for other people for a living if that were the case.  And so I had kind of become a member of that community, fashion shows, modeling, all that Washington had to offer.
Speaker 2: How would you describe that community?  Dressmakers, suit makers?
Speaker 1: Yeah, well they--so I'm to say it's that level of people who want to make clothing for.  It's not--it's not a fashion--sophisticated fashion group like from New York [New York], okay, and not style makers like that, they're just, you know, people who on a local level, if you just want--if you look through the Vogue pattern book and you see a purple dress that you like, you need someone to make it for you.  Well, here's a dressmaker.  She can make that dress for you, so just a contract agreement kind of thing.  So she has the skill for making a dress.  And then if I become an apprentice under her, she could teach me the skill of dressmaking.
Speaker 2: Who did you--who did you become an apprentice under?
Speaker 1: Pauline Elmore.
Speaker 2: Pauline Elmore was your mentor.
Speaker 1: Mentor.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, she helped me.  She--well, she--not only she but she and Martha Austin [ph.].  These were people that were available to me if I had a question.
Speaker 2: So, by the time you got to FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, New York], you could already make a dress from a pattern?
Speaker 1: Not--I thought I could.  Again, the skill had to be perfected.  So I had just been introduced to it at that level, okay.  Again, if you never go in--go beyond that, you're, you're, you're fabulous.  So, it, it requires your coming to a broader pool and, you know, much more talented people than yourself to be challenged.  So, you put--take that first day of school and throw your sketch on the table and go, you know, hey, y'all, you know.  My mom [Cleo Williams Davis] flips when she sees my sketches.  My friends, my--who--you know, I'm the only person in the whole community that can sketch, you're like, pop, you know.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And all these other talented kids were there, they were like, (gasp) you know.  And so then they open their books.  We're all there day one with our portfolios in our hand and everybody was like, (makes sound) you know, and so when I looked down the row and saw the fabulous sketches that all of my peers were making, I was like, oh, now it's like, (gesture) close my book quickly and never said another word.  So, again, but, but it--but that was great also.  I was up to the challenge.  It was a challenge, but I was up to the challenge.
Speaker 2: So, who admit- who was--who helped you get into FIT in 1971?
Speaker 1: No one.  I applied.
Speaker 2: You applied and you--
Speaker 1: I applied.  I came.  There was an admissions interview.  You would come with your sketches and whatever and they would just judge you based--everybody had raw talent, whatever it was, just--you got a list of a couple of art projects as well as some fashion, some other art projects that you would, you know, pursue, that you just bring them some examples of your artistic ability, whatever it was, and draw a horse, draw a fashion figure, and something abstract.  You know, and they, they, they challenge you with a few things, whatever, and then when you came for your interview, you brought all of that in your portfolio.
Story_ID: 505630
Speaker 1: Now, were you aware that there were black designers at the time?  Or there were no black designers for you to look up to?
Speaker 2: I hadn't gone to that level at that time because I think when you sort of come into fashion, you're basically--you know, Yves Saint Laurent, Valentino, you know, the, the very well-known names in fashion, so those names were--I mean, again, I was coming from a local level and just wanting to learn about dressmaking and, you know, so at that point--I, I mean, on the initial stages, Butterick pattern ma- book, Vogue pattern book was there, so everything was a Vogue or a Butterick or a McCall's [McCall Pattern Company, Inc.] at the initial stages.  Then after you become a little bit more aware, then you realize that the patterns that are in the Vogue pattern book, you know, the front cover, that's a coat by Givenchy, and you go, oh, who's that?  You know, like, what--who cares?  What's the difference?  And, and the next page was Valentino and the next page was So-and-So.  So, not only are you just looking at a book of dresses and wondering, can I learn to make that dress if I buy the pattern and follow the instructions, but now you're coming to be aware of the styling, the individual styling, who creates that styling and what their names are and what prestige that holds for an individual to be saying, excuse me, this is a Valentino, you know, and you go, oh, did I miss something?  You know, like is that important, you know?  So, you have to come into that.  So it, it really wasn't until I arrived in New York [New York] that those aspects became, you know, important and then that's according to who you meet as, as to, you know, which designer is your favorite designer or yours or who, who's--you know, that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 505633
Speaker 1: So upon reaching FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, New York] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) FIT.
Speaker 1: --and all of the, the fabulous young new talent that's there--
Speaker 2: Now, how many of the students at the start were--at FIT were black versus white versus Hispanic and Asian?  What was the--how was the--was it diverse?
Speaker 1: It was diverse.  It was--
Speaker 2: And it's 1973?  Or '71 [1971] when you arrived?
Speaker 1: Seventy-one [1971], yeah.
Speaker 2: So, FIT was very diverse, somewhat diverse?
Speaker 1: Very diverse, very diverse at the time.  There was a, a large number of black students there at FIT (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Who were some of the other black students?
Speaker 1: You know, I--when I first came there--well, Brian, Brian--let's see, was Brian there yet?
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Brian Lane?
Speaker 1: Lane.  Michael Horell [ph.] and Ronald Hodges [Ron Hodges] and--
Speaker 2: Just make the list--
Speaker 1: You know--
Speaker 2: --because this help us--
Speaker 1: Byron--
Speaker 2: --fill out the--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Byron Barnes and, let's see.
Speaker 2: Was Patti there?
Speaker 1: Patti--
Speaker 2: Carpenter [HistoryMaker Patti Carpenter]?
Speaker 1: Oh, she came like a year later.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Patti Carpenter.  Oh--
Speaker 2: Scott [Scott Barrie]--
Speaker 1: Anybody--
Speaker 2: --or [HistoryMaker] Stephen Burrows? That's what--
Speaker 1: Scott had already started in business.  They were--they were ahead of me (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: So, Scotty and Stephen and John Hagens [ph.] and certain people--
Story_ID: 505634
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What black designers were you aware of upon arriving at FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, New York]?  Were you aware of any?  Like, was Patrick Kelly making clothes then?
Speaker 2: (Shakes head) No.
Speaker 1: No, okay.
Speaker 2: Not at that point, no.
Speaker 1: So there were no big black designers at this moment.
Speaker 2: There were, but--
Speaker 1: Who were they?
Speaker 2: Well, well, I mean, Willi Smith--were--they were emerging.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were emerging.
Speaker 1: So, it would've been Willi Smith then and [HistoryMaker] Alvin Bell?
Speaker 2: And Alvin Bell.  But, but--
Speaker 1: But they were emerging.
Speaker 2: --what was happening--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, but what happened because actually, again, their, you know, transition took place a little later--
Speaker 1: Than '71 [1971].
Speaker 2: --than, than '71 [1971].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, they were emerging.  There was an initiative that took place at that time.  There was a boutique called the O Boutique [New York, New York] and--
Speaker 1: O?
Speaker 2: O, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Like Oprah [Oprah Winfrey], O?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And what, what it was, it was like a consortium of designers, black designers, so--
Speaker 1: Only black?
Speaker 2: Only black designers.  And so it involved Fry Higgins [ph.], [HistoryMaker] Stephen Burrows, I think Lonnie Withersp- Lonnie Witherspoon [ph.], and--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: I'm trying to remember some of the--I, I--the names of all--the group Yancy [ph.] I think was in it.  I, I can't remember all of the people that were involved at the time.  But the point is, it was an--it, it was an opportunity for a group of black, emerging black designers to get the opportunity to, to learn some business skills, production skills, and to get their first line out, the least of which was Stephen Burrows, (background noise) okay, because he didn't have the, the money to keep up with what was going on.  And so what he did was--he was--
Speaker 1: Let's just pause 'til that passes because this is a good story.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: So, let's go back to just the O--it was called the O Consorts?
Speaker 2: Bou- Boutique.
Speaker 1: O Boutique.
Speaker 2: O Boutique.  And it was--it was a--an organization had started up whereby--it was a store.  It was a boutique in the Village [Greenwich Village, New York, New York] and they gave different, a, a group of designers the opportunity to make their clothing and put them in the store, okay.  So let's say everybody had a rack, okay, and you had to keep your rack viable, okay.  So that opportunity was there for X number of designers that were in this little group, okay.  So people emerged from the, the, the designers, so a number of designers emerged from that opportunity, John Hagens [ph.], Stephen Burrows, Lester Hyatt, I think.  A few designers who, who made a name at that time all emerged from that opportunity.
Speaker 1: But who created that O Boutique opportunity?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that part I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I wasn't a part--I was aware of it but I wasn't a member or whatever at the time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now--
Story_ID: 505635
Speaker 1: Do you know anything at all, and I, I just, just--do you know anything at all about club life in New York [New York] at that time in '71 [1971]?
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was it Paradise Garage [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Garage primarily, Garage, if, if--you know, or you know Studio 50- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And then this is when Grace Jones was big and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --so that scene, people would've been dressing for that--those occasions.
Speaker 2: Well, the big--the disco era.
Speaker 1: Disco, okay.
Speaker 2: You know, so that was the big disco era.
Speaker 1: But, but that would've been like the opposite of Studio 54 [New York, New York], like more black people went to the Garage?  Was that like the scene?  Was it a different scene than Studio 54 as far as clothes and fashion and disco?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, that--it was all one in the same.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: On different nights, you just went to a different place--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --however, you know, whatever and primarily the same--because discos were open on a particular night.
Speaker 1: Okay, so every--it was the same, same, but Monday, you go here, Tuesday, you go there, whoever has--okay.
Story_ID: 505636
Speaker 1: O [O Boutique, New York, New York], back to Steve [HistoryMaker Stephen Burrows].  You said he--least of all, he had the least amount of money.
Speaker 2: Of money at--to go--so what he did was, he would take the scraps of fabrics on the floor.  Whatever the other designers were working on, he would gather the scraps and splice them together and make a dress out of scraps of fabric and then do this lattice edge that he would do, which was something weird.  And so he got a name from making those crazy scraps of hodgepodge of all colors and all different textures of fabric, dresses that he would make, so that became unique for him and he got discovered by whomever, Vogue magazine or somebody for that type of dresses that he made, and he emerged from that group.  So, I'm just saying, so that was a way in which--so that buzz was there--
Speaker 1: For the students at FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: For the students at FIT (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You, you, you were working to get a rack in O Boutique [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Some were.  I mean, there were other--
Speaker 1: I mean, that was a dream thing to, to come about.
Speaker 2: That was an opportunity.  It was black, okay, and so, therefore, in the broader 7th Avenue sense, you really were trying to get a job at Bill Blass or--
Speaker 1: Halston or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, yeah.
Speaker 1: --any, anyone else.
Speaker 2: --or some name house on 7th Avenue.  That was the optimum.  That's what you were trying to do.  However, of course, people, too, also get the notion to have their own business, okay.  How brave, how novel, you know, if you think that you're gonna make your own business.  So, therefore, you had a Scott Barrie.  The first black designer on 7th Avenue I think in the late '60s [1960s] was Wesley Tann [Wesley Tann, Jr.].  The first black designer to--
Speaker 1: Wesley Tann, let's just stick with him for a moment.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was--what type of clothing, what, men's, women's?
Speaker 2: I think women's.  I think he did elegant evening wear, okay, in the late '60s [1960s] on 7th Avenue for--primarily for celebrities.  I think, as, as I recall--I, I think I recall him saying that he was doing debutante type of gowns or something initially, was selling, but I know that he was the first--I--again, I, later became aware of him, not at that time, not at that time.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But, again, because when you're in school--
Speaker 1: And then he was making clothes for people, probably mainly white women who were debutantes or socialites (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --and he was in a whole different scene himself.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 505637
Speaker 1: But, again, when you're in school, so you're really just competing and coexisting with that--
Speaker 2: Students.
Speaker 1: --you know, the students that, that are there, you know, at the school and then you broaden out to that as the teachers, as you become exposed to more.  New York [New York] is a big city--
Speaker 2: Who--
Speaker 1: --you know.
Speaker 2: What teachers were inspirational or say laid their hands on you during your time at FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, New York]?
Speaker 1: The, the--all the instructors there were called professor, professor whomever.  Everybody had the title, professor.  So, you--the Professor Roberts [David Roberts], for instance, was responsible for the fashion design classes, Professor--it's a Japanese name--Kis- Kisawati [ph.] or some name like that was the fashion art teacher.  They had very, very high level, top-notch teachers at that time.  So, so we really were, were really pushed, you know, to perform, you know, at a very high level.  And some kids, of course, caught on quickly, those who were talented, I mean, at your level of talent, and some, you know, whatever.  But, there were a lot of very talented students at FIT at that time, very talented.  So there was a lot to, to look up to, you know, a lot to live up to in terms of getting into the--to the--to the main circle.
Speaker 2: So, what was your main--
Speaker 1: You know.
Speaker 2: --thrust of, of study at FIT?  You, you were going to leave there with what?
Speaker 1: You--well, that's where you developed a skill for dressmaking, for pattern making, for draping, okay. For real, okay, not what you learned back at home.
Speaker 2: Not a McCall pattern [McCall Pattern Company, Inc.] (laughter).
Speaker 1: This is not a McCall or Butterick or Vogue pattern.  This is whereby you are creating--
Speaker 2: A pattern.
Speaker 1: Okay, the pattern--but you're creating the style yourself.  You're designing an actual dress and then you're learning how to drape and make the dress properly so it really fits, and you're understanding what you're doing, okay, and not in a pseudo sort of way whereby you're going to the--buy a pattern and you just are connecting the dots.
Speaker 2: How was what you were learning at FIT different from what Mrs.--
Speaker 1: Elmore.
Speaker 2: Elm- had, had--
Speaker 1: Pauline Elmore had taught me.
Speaker 2: --had taught you?
Speaker 1: When you buy a Vogue pattern, it's like painting by the numbers.  You just connect the dots.  You just follow the--because it's all kind of numbered and laid out.  When you go to FIT, now you're, you're not buying a pattern, you're making the pattern, you're drafting the pattern yourself, so you have to know how to calculate, how to measure, and how to put those numbers on paper.  You have to learn how to--so that's what I'm saying.  So it's a difference in just dressmaking where you're just connecting the dots versus drafting patterns, learning how to make, and knowing what you're doing and why you're doing it from a technical point of view, what a pattern is, what's a good pattern and a bad pattern, what's a dress that fits and a dress that doesn't, construction, you know, what are well-made clothing looking like, okay, what's the difference? So all those techniques are given to you and you, you, you learn it and then you refine it, you know, to a point where you really know what you're doing.
Story_ID: 505638
Speaker 1: So after two years of FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, New York], okay, then I then wondered, should I stay on at FIT?  That way--I had an associate's degree, should I stay on and get a master's degree at FIT which would've been four years, or what was the higher education?  How high can you go as far as fashion is r- is concerned?  What's the highest education or the highest degree that you can get in the fashion arena?  My brother, my older brother, Jordan [Jordan Davis, Jr.], at this point, was going to American University [Washington, D.C.] and he aspired to go forward and get his doctorate degree, okay, in, in rehab, rehabilitation skills, okay.  So within our family unit, of course, sibling, you know, rivalry going on as, as well as, you know, me out there with my friends and my other colleagues that were there too, I had to kind of always look to the left to see, well, what's happening within the family dynamic.  And so like he was going up, I had to go up, too.  So what was suggested to me was, well the highest possible education that you can get in fashion is couture.  So, having taken the New York [New York] challenge and coming from Washington [D.C.] to New York, not a big deal, I was ready for the next challenge.  Go to Paris [France], get a couture certificate, not a big deal.  So, once again, I turned to my lovely parents [Cleo Williams Davis and Jordan Davis, Sr.] and said, guess what (laughter), I'm ready to go to Paris, and they're like, are you crazy?  But, once again, my father with his wisdom, he said, "Okay, let's think about it.  First of all, apply, apply to the school, see if you're accepted, apply."  So I sent off my application to them and--
Speaker 2: And what was the school?  What was the name of the school?
Speaker 1: Now, so, before I tell you the name, I'll explain to you.  The couture union in Paris has a school, so the union of the couture houses is called the Chambre Syndicale [Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture], okay, which is the union for--of the couture houses.  So this is--that's the school, the union school that train you, give you couture training to come and work in a union house.  So the name of the school, ecole which is school, Ecole de la Chambre Syndicale Couture Parisienne [Ecole de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne, Paris, France].  So it's the Chambre Syndicale, the union school for couture, okay.  So that's the name of the school in Paris.  So, I applied, I was accepted.
Story_ID: 505639
Speaker 1: Now, here's an interesting story.  Well, I mean, there's a lot of details in between as to how I got there [Ecole de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne, Paris, France], family money, donations from the church, everybody participated, every threw some money in there because, you know, how was I gonna get there, this notion that I'm going to school in Paris [France], okay fine, but, grace of God, I got there.  When I arrived at the school, the tuition was I think three thousand dollars and you had to have it paid--pay it in full upon arrival as I understood.  You had to have a money order, a money order or bank transfer, okay.  When I arrived, I, you know, came up to the school and, you know, the first day, and I was told that my name was not on the list.  The--you know, I was, you know, like, you know, hello?  And like, excuse me?  You know, am I--I'm sorry, no, we don't see--I don't see your name on the list.  And I was like stunned and I was like, don't tell me, you know, don't tell me.  You know, she says, excuse me, you know, no, bye.  So, don't tell me that I'm suddenly here in Paris, France--I mean, I flew on a plane for the first time, TWA [Trans World Airlines], I was in a foreign country for the first time my whole life.  I had never even heard the word passport before in my life.  I was there with foreign money.  I had to arrive there and try to find a place to stay and now, first day of school and you're telling me, what?  Strangely enough, for some odd reason, I nervously opened up my bag.  I mean, this woman had completely dismissed me, but I stood there and I opened my bag and I took out papers, my passport, my whatever because I was looking for my letter of admission, my acceptance letter to come because I--I'm gonna, you know, persuade her to let--you gotta read this letter.  I'm not--there's a mistake somewhere.  Attached--my mother [Cleo Williams Davis]--attached to the letter was also my check for three thousand dollars.  So, somehow or other, when I presented that letter to her with the check attached, she kind of took an about face and was like, hm.  She took the letter and she says, "Well, hold on a minute."  She went inside, shut the door, whatever, and came back in a few minutes and said, "Oh, we just found your name."  I says, "Okay."  So I was relieved and I began taking classes.
Speaker 2: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS):  But now, now, before that, what did I have to do?  I had to get--what was his name, Reverend Fauntroy [HistoryMaker Reverend Walter Fauntroy] was the what?  Oh, oh, had a--almost had a heart attack.  The boy called and said, I just didn't--I couldn't understand.
Speaker 1: But we had--
Speaker 2: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS):  Don't you remember?
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I haven't gotten to that yet.
Speaker 2: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS):  And, and, and, and (laughter) we had a heart attack here.
Speaker 1: But, okay, but I haven't come to that yet.
Speaker 2: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS):  Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: I'm telling them--
Speaker 2: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS):  All right.  I'm sorry (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, my reason--my reason for telling you this story about the check was because within a month that I had gone--had started school there, I met a girl named Sheila.  Her name is Sheila Cotton [ph.], a black student who was there, American, and she was working as what's called a au pair, okay, a--you work in exchange--you babysit in exchange for room and board, okay, which is common in Paris for young girls.  And there was a place called the American Center [Paris, France] and it was a meeting place primarily for jazz musicians in Paris, but African Americans, so it was kind of a place where you could come and meet people from home, so to speak.  So I, I learned of this place and I went there and I met some people and strangely enough, I met Sheila, and when we shared our stories of why we were there in Paris, she had come for the same purpose, to come to the same school.  She had come the same day that I had come to the school and she was turned away as well.  She was turned away as well.  Now, she didn't pull out a check.  So when they told her, I'm sorry, your name is not on the list, she went away and that was it.  I was the only black student in that school and I--for the two years that I went there.  I was the only black student in the school.  I didn't say African American, I said black, ever in that school at that time, okay.  And so, again, why--I'm imagining it is because the money was in their face and they were like, okay, we're not turning down this money, we'll throw him in the corner and ignore him.
Story_ID: 505640
Speaker 1: But, anyway, I went to school at F- at the--at Ecole de la Chambre Syndicale [Ecole de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne, Paris, France] for two years and got couture training.  The instructor that I had there at the school was--she worked--she was--she was an elderly lady but she worked for many years at the house of Madame Gres [Alix Barton], you know, G-R-E-S, (pronunciation) Gres, is the way you pronounce it.  But, they--Madame Gres did sculptured evening grounds that were--evening gowns that were ruched, and it was sculptured, so this woman was very detailed, very strict, very, very strict, and she didn't let us get away with anything.  So, so I really got good training, good training.  I mean, now this is opposed to going to school at FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, New York]--so, I'm just saying, you can see the level of skill as--coming from Washington [D.C.] and learning how to make dresses, Vogue pattern dresses, and then moving on to FIT and getting the refinement of really knowing how to construct and design a garment and construct the garment, and draft a pattern, and then going on to Paris [France] and learning even more refinement.  Because at the school in Paris, there were no irons, no irons--there was no ironing board, there was no sewing machine.  Everything was done strictly by hand, strictly.  There was no sewing machine and we had to make a complete dress by hand. (Gesture) So, we really learned.
Story_ID: 505641
Speaker 1: After having gotten that skill, then I worked at the house of Scherrer, Jean-Louis Scherrer.  So that was the first job that I had in Paris [France] as kind of an apprentice.  Now, it, it sounds fabulous and exclusive, but what hap- what was happening at that time was there was kind of like a room of designers, okay, young apprentice designers and you were part of that sort of team, that community.  And lines, fashion lines consisted of like the four seasons at, at, at that point, so when the models would come out, you know, there would be bathing suits, then raincoats, then so--then, daywear, then eveningwear.  A line would be complete like that for, for whatever the house, house--the--you know, Christian Dior, Yves Saint Laurent, you know, they would have full ranges of their designs like that, okay.  So what we were broken into were teams and so, you know, team A did all the tailoring, coats and that, this team worked on bathing suits, you know, so on and so on.  So, I was on the eveningwear team doing the--because I worked--had that instructor who did--taught us all that ruching and that fine detail with chiffon and soft fabrics, so I worked there.
Story_ID: 505642
Speaker 1: At that point, having been in Paris [France] for two years, the glamour and the glitz of Paris had kind of worn off, you know, so what.  And I kind of longed to be back home because I had become a, a part of the FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, New York] community, the New York [New York] community, the disco night community, my friends, everyone was back in New York, and I was over there, okay.
Speaker 2: Now, at the time you were there, James Baldwin was still alive?  Was he there?
Speaker 1: Yes, now I--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --said to you again how intense the studies--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --were, so there wasn't a lot of leisure time, I mean, not for me, not to be able to keep up, okay.  Primarily, there was a total focus on, on my studies and I was in Paris and that was lovely but, you know, as friends would say, you know, let's go to London [England] tomorrow, let's ex- you know, go here, let's do that, Josephine Baker or whatever, I, I just didn't have time to really partake of all of that.  I was--it was so intense.  It was so intense and if you blinked for a minute, you fall behind, okay.  It was just that intense.  However, on the Left Bank in the section of Paris that's kind of what's considered bohemian, the student section, I would pass through some evenings with friends that, that I had met at the American Center [Paris, France], and that's when I met this stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid guy who would be on the corner a lot of times with a rack of clothing selling dresses off the rack and chicken sandwiches and anything else, talking wild out of his mind.  He may have on God knows what, and I would see him and go, you know, "Hi, Patrick [Patrick Kelly]," and he would go, you know, "Cool, man, cool, what's up?"  And I would go, like, "What are you doing," you know?  And he's, "I'm selling my dresses, dresses with buttons on them and uneven hem lines and all kind of crazy stuff."  And I would go, "Nobody's gonna buy this stuff."  He said, "Yeah, they do, they do buy it."  Well, I was in couture school [Ecole de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne, Paris, France].  I, I, I was learning what Yves Saint Laurent was doing.  And he was like, "Yeah, but this is cool, this is crazy."  I said, "It is crazy, but like what are you making?"  You know, so outrageous, okay.  But we were friends.  I would, you know, talk with him a lot about, you know, fashion, about his, you know, goals, his, his dreams of, of being--
Speaker 2: And what were his goals and dreams at that time?  What did he say?
Speaker 1: Like we all were, to have our own label, our own fashion house, our own fashion empire, you know, and that thing.  I, I thought coming from where I was, you know, coming from, that was like I had a better opportunity for it rather than he's standing on the street corner.
Speaker 2: Selling chicken sandwiches and clothes.
Speaker 1: And clothing and he could--he would do your hair, he would wash your clothes, he was surviving.  He was--he was definitely a survivor.  But, there were other--others like him as well, you know, other--and, and maybe not fashion designers but other artists.  I mean, because, again, that larger community of, of, of fashion people were--[HistoryMaker] Pat Cleveland who was there struggling to be a fashion model, Carol LaBrie.  There were a dozen girls that were always back and forth, coming from America, no place to stay, no clue of where they were, you know, naive, green as corn, we all were, but we were there.  And opportunities--I think the, the, the club, the disco at that time was Club Sept [Paris, France], you know, number seven, and so everybody would go to Club Sept at night, Antonio Lopez, Andre Leon Talley, everybody would be there.  We were all babies.  And, dance, and, and chill out, and, and perform, and outdo one another, and it was a nightmare.  It was--it was a mess.  It was a mess.  So, those were the opportunities, the few opportunities that I did have to go and hang out and I would see such people and meet them and--
Speaker 2: But that was the scene.  I mean, you saw the, the people that--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --needed to, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, again, with--I mean, a name.  You know, hi, this is Patrick, hi Patrick.  Who's Patrick?  You know, he's nobody, he's--I'm nobody, he's nobody, you know, just friends, you know.  So, for such people to emerge later, you go, oh my God, I can't believe he suddenly became somebody--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --you know.  It's just a, you know, a, a roll of the dice.
Story_ID: 505643
Speaker 1: In any event, I, I was work--I'm sorry, I, I went to the couture school [Ecole de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne, Paris, France], I got a job.  I, you know, just--I guess I just longed to be home and, and, and back with my family and all that stuff.  And so I got back--I, I, I--after having worked for a summer, I came home and decided to, to stay and not go back.
Speaker 2: So you completed the school, though--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --in what year?
Speaker 1: Five, '75 [1975].
Speaker 2: In '75 [1975] and you got the job.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So your first professional job was with the house of?
Speaker 1: Scherrer.
Speaker 2: Scherrer.
Speaker 1: Jean-Louis Scherrer.
Speaker 2: Jean-Louis Scherrer.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, in Paris [France].
Speaker 2: And, and you worked as an apprentice assistant.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, it's a fortunate--you know, for that to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So that's '77 [1977] 'cause you--because you did it for two years?
Speaker 1: No, no, school was two years.
Speaker 2: Right and then--
Speaker 1: And, no, and then--and then I just worked--
Speaker 2: You worked for--
Speaker 1: --for Scherrer for about six months.
Speaker 2: Okay, and then so two years and six months, you're ready to come home.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So then upon coming home with the couture certificate and some background, some experience in terms of working or whatever, I could not get a job on 7th Avenue [New York, New York], couldn't get arrested.
Speaker 2: But it was very hard for black people in general to get jobs on 7th Avenue.
Speaker 1: Right.  However, I had the added dimension that I was presenting a couture certificate and degree and with my, my resume at the time, you know, that's what I was selling.  That's what I was presenting myself as and so to most people, that just only indicated that you're gonna want a lot of money, so everybody was like, no.  And then, see the--7th Avenue was divided at that time in terms of there's 7th Avenue and it was Broadway, so if you're gonna be a 7th Avenue designer, then you didn't wanna--you wouldn't go on Broadway, God forbid.  So you had to stay in 7th Avenue, you were either gonna work in 550, 530, possibly 525, 498 was emerging at that time but it's not really where you wanted to be, but you wanted to be in one of those--that's where the, the designers were located, in 550 and 530, primarily, at that time, that's 7th Avenue.
Story_ID: 505644
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: What?  You know, so I was like, no, this is--
Speaker 1: Did you stay there one night even?
Speaker 2: Not even, not even one night.  I was--I, I, I--because I was there with my lu- I was, you know--too threa- I'm--look, I'm a New Yorker now, so, like, like, no, you can't--
Speaker 1: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) do this to me.  So when I showed up with all of my earthly belongings and it was like, you know, I'm not getting ready to just, you know, open my luggage and pull out all of my fabulous--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --things and then go, go to sleep and have them all disappear.  You know, I was like, no.  So what happened was, I, I left there and, and, and what's so strange is, I had no--you won't believe this.  I had no idea--okay, A, I went to, to the school [Ecole de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne, Paris, France] and they told me you're not on the list and I said, "What?"  I gave her my admissions letter and she was like, "Okay, fine, no problem, come back tomorrow, okay.  I mean, the check," whatever, but I mean, you know, like, maybe there's still some uncertainty, maybe tomorrow she'll still once again say no, you know, whatever, I don't know.  But I left there now, you know, back to, to this--because I dropped my luggage off and I just went and checked in at school to come back and say, okay, fine, I'm gonna find a hotel or someplace else to stay, but let me go and secure, you know, check in at school first.  So, with the chaos of that having happened, and then I came out of there with that uncertainty, but, okay, and then now, let me challenge where I'm gonna stay, I, I--you know, there was a lot of confusion and I just started asking questions like, do you know of a place?  Do you know of a place?  Well, there's a hostel here, maybe full, I don't know, but check it out, full.  I would--there's a hostel here, but check it out, full, whatever.  By about nine o'clock that night, okay, can I ask you a question?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Where was--where was the Y [Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA)]?
Speaker 1: Where--
Speaker 2: What's the--what's--where's the Y?  What's the address of the Y?
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't know.
Speaker 2: I didn't either.  So, I was standing on the street.  Every hostel that I had gone to was full.  Every suggestion that anyone had given me amounted to zero, and now, I need to make the decision to either go back to the Y and spend the one night if that were the case or whatever.  The fellow in the office there agreed to hold onto my luggage for me, but just in my haste to just say I'm not staying here, I just sort of rushed out the door onto what seemed like a, a great, you know, prospect.  Someone told me, oh, I know of a hostel over here, you know, go to this address, boom, you know what I'm saying?  So, I just, you know, just with all anticipation just went, went right to that place thinking, okay, this, this is gonna work.  You know, I'll go there, I'll sign up, whatever, I'll come back, I'll get my lu- you know, it's all gonna be fine, but it wasn't.  So after having--you know, I came to this sudden stop and was like, okay, you're gonna catch a cab and go bac- . Oh, my God, what's--I went to the park across and I sat in the park on a park bench, and sat there and cried for a while.  Then, I prayed for a while.  Then, I just--I, I just went in, I didn't know what I was gonna do.  And this is just my only true story that I can just tell it--I can only tell it to you this way, that strangely enough, I just was--put my hand in my pocket and I had a brochure from the YMCA.  I, I just really can swear to you--I can swear to you at this moment, I did not pick that up.  I could--I can swear to you I did not put that in my pocket, but it was the brochure with their address on it, sup- I mean, grace of God, super grace of God.  I jumped in the taxi, rushed back over to that place, I got my luggage.  Again, I was like, no, I'm just not staying here.  Well, actually when I got back, they were full for the--because it's, it's a transient place.  They were--for the night, they were full.  So the fellow who was there suggested that I could go down the street and just stay at a ho- a little, you know, cheap hotel that was just two doors down or whatever, suggested I could just go there, so I did.  It was fleabag hotel, forget about it, but whatever, but that's where I stayed the first night.
Story_ID: 505645
Speaker 1: The next morning, I got up, I, of course, had to go to school, so I went to the school [Ecole de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne, Paris, France] and found out, okay, yes I am attending, okay, no problem, and then I got friendly with the instructor there and she suggested there's a hotel down the street from the school, so I stayed there the second night.  Now, so what mama's [Cleo Williams Davis] eluding to is the fact that in the process of all of this happening, I, of course--that first night in the process of all this happening, I called home in a panic, "I don't have a place to stay, I'm not being admitted to the school, I don't know what I'm gonna do."  So, while I was resolving these problems for myself, they were at home panicking, calling the White House, the [U.S.] Capitol (laughter), and the militia (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS):  (Simultaneous) Sure did and got, got somebody out of [U.S.] Congress.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS):  Reverend Fauntroy [HistoryMaker Reverend Walter Fauntroy], right?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS):  And Reverend Fauntroy contacted the school.  He, he was from the Senate [sic. U.S. House of Representatives], I know that.  And somehow, they made connection.  He said, don't worry, we're from the United States.  They are gonna see him.  They're gonna take care of him.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS):  Now, that happened.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS):  And, I, I, I was so afraid that, you know, he didn't have any prayer, I said, oh, my God--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS): --you know, you know, I--it nearly killed me.
Speaker 1: So, so they weren't aware of the events that transpired on my side, you know, that, that led up to me--and then--so then ultimately, I--so, therefore, I'm now attending the school and I'm staying at the hotel that was like six doors down from the school.  At least I had landed, okay.  And then what happened after that was I was--I was staying at the hotel, I, I--at the American Center [Paris, France], once I started, you know--
Speaker 2: Meeting people.
Speaker 1: --hanging out over there, meeting people, I met an African guy who knew someone who was like a, a, a real estate agent who could get apartments around town, and so he found me a little flat, you know, that was there like a, a--at the top of--where Champs-Elysees [Avenue des Champs-Elysees, Paris, France] is.  At the top of Champs-Elysees, there was a little building.  It was on the roof, like a slanted roof, a little room, a closet, a closet, okay, and so it, it was whatever, you know, per, per month and whatever.  I contacted my parents and said I have a possible place and my father [Jordan Davis, Sr.] said, okay.  You know, we, we, we don't want to worry, take it, you know.  And so then--you know, so now--and that was like about, you know, three weeks later, but finally, I had a place and I was there, you know.  And, so, I mean, that's just a little side story as, as to--you know, something that happened (laughter), one of my traumatic moments in Paris [France].
Story_ID: 505646
Speaker 1: However, but I had, had a--so, so, that took place.  I went to school there [Ecole de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne, Paris, France] and enjoyed, you know, my, my, my time in Paris [France], my years--
Speaker 2: So you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) studying.
Speaker 2: --back in New York [New York] and you couldn't find a job because people thought you wanted too much because of your couture certificate.
Speaker 1: Exactly.  So I dropped it, the couture.  I didn't mention it anymore.  I stopped saying it, okay.  And now I was just strictly looking for a job.
Speaker 2: And you were looking for a job doing what?
Speaker 1: Designing.
Speaker 2: Designing.
Speaker 1: Designing or whatever.
Speaker 2: But you were only, what twenty-something at the time?
Speaker 1: Yeah, twenty-two I think, twenty-two.
Speaker 2: So how likely was it that they would let a twenty-two-year-old design?
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, I'm, I'm presenting myself as having a couture certificate.  I have a portfolio and that's how you're hired based on your level of talent.  And so, anyway, I got out there, I showed my portfolio everywhere.  I had experiences such as, I went--I, I, I--Donna Karan's mother was someone that I had met.  I had gotten a--sort of like a freelance project with this company called Sequel One [ph.], and Donna Karan's mother, her nickname on the--on the avenue [7th Avenue, New York, New York], everyone knew her, Richie [Helen Faske].  Her name was Richie. (Background noise) Now, at this point in time, Donna Karan means absolutely nothing to me.  She was working at Anne Klein.  She and Louis Dell'Olio were part--were assistant designers at Anne Klein (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Anne Klein.
Speaker 1: --at the time and--which, I don't know, you know, your daughter, Donna, you know, but I'm working with this lady, Richie, who we all liked.
Story_ID: 505647
Speaker 1: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS):  That was something else, just rotten spoiled.  That's all he was.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS):  He wasn't used to being away from home on Christmas.
Speaker 2: Well, like Christmas, I snuck out (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS):  (Simultaneous) And, and in Paris [France]--
Speaker 2: I snuck away and, and found a cheap flight and got home, like, with no clue how I was getting back.
Speaker 1: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS):  No, no--let me tell you, I was upstairs and his baby brother [Phillip Davis] and I were upstairs.  We'd just gone upstairs to go to bed.  The front door opened.  His father [Jordan Davis, Sr.] drove a cab and so forth, so we knew it wasn't him.  Now, who had the key to my house?  And, so my son, it's a wonder he's living, had a base- his baseball bat and he come flying up the steps and he--I said, don't hit him, it's Leonard [HistoryMaker Leonard Davis] (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS):  What are you doing here?
Speaker 2: Well, this is one of the--the, the point is, what happened was, it was nearing Christmas and, of course, we're all students stuck there in, in Paris, and what are we going to do for Christmas.  Well I, of course, wanted to go home, you know.  I was like wondering how am I gonna get home?  Could I possibly imagine going home for Christmas?  So, another friend knew of a really, really super cheap flight on this airline, Icelandic Airline [Icelandic Airlines; Icelandair], super cheap, student discount, no frills, you practically had to fly the plane yourself.  And I think it was a hundred bucks [dollars], you know, which was a fortune if you don't have it at the time.  So, I borrowed and stole and lied and did whatever.  I got a hundred bucks out.  I, I scared up a hundred dollars some kind of way and I got a ticket and I went home.  But I didn't let anyone know that I was coming.  So, I just said, this is my Christm- I had no gifts, so I was like, this is my Christmas surprise.  I'll show up.  So, I got home, but it was really late, it snowed, it was whatever and, and I got home like really like three o'clock in the morning by the time I really got to, to Washington [D.C.].  So I just had the keys, so I just rushed into the house and surprised everybody or whatever.  But then I had no idea how I was gonna get back, you know.  So my Christmas surprise was really that, hey mom [Cleo Williams Davis] and dad, you're gonna have to buy me an airline ticket and send me back (laughter).  So, so, they weren't that happy to see me after, after that (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But anyway, and then my--the whole family--actually, so for Christmas, what became my Christmas gift was the family all had to contribute, my uncles and aunts and everybody had to contribute--
Speaker 1: To get you back to Paris.
Speaker 2: --to get me back to--and it wasn't a hundred dollars going back--so, so, had to contribute.  Because typically at that time, an airline ticket to Paris was three hundred dollars and, and so they--everybody had to contribute.  So then at that point--
Speaker 1: (CLEO WILLIAMS DAVIS): (Unclear).
Speaker 2: --and, yeah, so it wasn't such a great idea for--my, my little notion, sneak home and you'll figure out how you'll get back (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Get back.
Speaker 2: You're like, okay, yeah, right.  We're paying tuition, hotel, what--you know, what--and now you, you suddenly showed up on a whim and now we gotta get you back, okay, fine.  But, anyway, so, that's just another side story.
Story_ID: 505648
Speaker 1: So you're working for Donna's [Donna Karan] daughter--I mean, Donna's mother (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, I had a freelance--
Speaker 1: --Richie [Helen Faske].
Speaker 2: --a freelance assignment with a company, Sequel One [ph.], lo and behold, a lady was working there who was very friendly to me named Richie who, of course, turns out to be Donna Karan's mother, and she liked me a lot.  She thought that I was very talented and she wanted to offer me an opportunity at one point because, again, I was freelancing.  So, she said I'm gonna call some friends of mine and see if they'll see you for an interview.  The friends happened to be Pearl [Pearl Nipon] and Albert Nipon, and she called her friends and she says, "I have someone that I want to send to you, a designer.  He's very talented and I'll think you'll like him.  I think that you may in fact hire him, you know."  And they were like, "Is he that good?"  And she says, "I think he's incredible.  He has his portfolio.  I wanna send him up."  Now, within the circle on 7th Avenue, okay, she had to give the signal.  She says, "Now, he's very talented but he's as black as the ace of spades, but I think you should see him."  So with that, they said, "Okay, well, okay, we'll send him up anyway."  So she hung up the phone and went, hey, I gave you--look, look what I did for you, hey.  So I was like a little stunned, you know, trying to figure out, am I really as black as the ace of spades, what did that mean?  Not thinking politically actually and thinking, well, I guess she still had to give them the signal, so they--
Speaker 1: He's black, yeah.
Speaker 2: --wouldn't call her back and go, what is this?  And I went up, they saw me, but nothing transpired.  However, then they passed me along to another friend for another go-see, look-see, Mr. Oleg Cassini.  I had--from that appointment, they made an arrangement for me to see Oleg Cassini.  I went to see him, he flipped, thought my book was fabulous, my ideas were fabulous, and he therefore challenged me because he said, "This can't be your sketching, this can't be your book."  I said, "Why not?  Of course it is."  So, he took my portfolio away from me, gave me a blank sheet of paper and a pencil and he said, "If these are your sketches, then I want to see you right here and now duplicate one of these sketches.  Just do a drawing that's good that looks like this, right here and now.  I want to see it."  So, he left the room and left me there sketching, trying to prove that these were my sketches, and he took the portfolio and he left.  And I--within twenty minutes or twenty-five minutes, I had something I thought was appropriate to show him and, but it was quiet, it was about six o'clock, it was kind of after hours, and no one was around.  So I slowly got up and started searching around and yelling for someone, you know, trying to get--see if there was anyone around.  And a--and a noise was coming from down the hall, so I got out of--walked out of his office and went down the corridor to find a group of people all standing around a sketch artist at an easel and they had my book open and they were all pointing, going, that one, did you get that one, now get this one, did you get that one, now this one.  Well, I had no idea what was going on because I was naive and, how--and I actually was flattered because I figured, how great, they're admiring my work.  So as it turns out, I sort of made a gesture or noise or something and Mr. Cassini looked around and went, like, it's you, you are fabulous.  And he folded my portfolio, gave it back to me, and he says, "I'm gonna call you tomorrow."  I said, "Fine," and I went home and--I got a job--I got a job--I got a job--I got a job.  I called mom [Cleo Williams Davis] said I'm gonna be working for Oleg Cassini, you know.  Never heard from him again.  So with stories such as that on 7th Avenue, it just wasn't happening.
Story_ID: 505649
Speaker 1: Lo and behold, I went to a headhunter.  I can't recall her name at this moment, but anyway, a headhunter, and they told me it was a job available as an assistant to Willi Smith.  So, that wasn't my designing level.  I mean, I was thinking I would get couture.  You know, I was gonna get something, you know.  Willi Smith, sportswear, junior sportswear, (makes sound) but I went.  And we had a long talk.  He liked my sketches.  He liked what I was doing.  And so he says, "Well, would you like to join my organization," you know.  "I'll have to merge you into the mix and let's, let's just start it.  I mean, at least it's a job.  You're not working, you're struggling, it's a job," you know.  And so I was like, okay, cool, you know.  So I started there and I, I just did everything, whatever.  I did everything.
Speaker 2: But, let's talk about your experience at WilliWear [WilliWear Ltd.], sort of if you can create for me who was working there, what were you producing, what was the atmosphere like, where was the studio located? Where's the--
Speaker 1: We--
Speaker 2: --work rooms?
Speaker 1: Willi went through several transitions.
Speaker 2: When you were there.  Let's talk about when--
Speaker 1: Willi, Willi went through several transitions because I think he went from WilliWu [ph.] to Paprika to Cinnamon Wear [ph.] to WilliWear.  All these transitions were different backers, different, you know, partners, trying to have a business, be--you know, in a partnership way.  Ultimately when he got to WilliWear, Laurie [Laurie Mallet] and her husband [Jacques Mallet]--I can't recall their last name, they were French, and a Indian guy named Om [Om Batheja], the four of them, so it's a husband and wife, the Indian (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Om and Willi.
Speaker 1: The Indian manufacturer and Willi, so the four partners was WilliWear.  So Willi's contribution obviously was the creative part and then Om--
Speaker 2: Manufactured.
Speaker 1: --manufactured and then the two, these two financially, of course, were there as well as they were kind of--
Speaker 2: Business people.
Speaker 1: --business and, and design.  They had their own sort of design concept, design influence as well, but Willi was head designer.  So, but that introduced the opportunity to manufacture the clothing out of India.
Speaker 2: Now, were the husband and wife African American or were they what (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) French.
Speaker 2: French, French, okay.
Speaker 1: Laurie and her husband.
Speaker 2: So, they--everyone was non-white American who worked on Willi's--at--that team.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That group.
Speaker 1: And so then what happened--because Willi had an--was initially had gotten recognition, notoriety from working for a company called Digits when he was doing the junior sportswear.
Story_ID: 505650
Speaker 1: Betsey Johnson, Willi Smith. You know, junior sportswear was being invented at that time, okay.  You know, young girls didn't wanna dress like their mothers, you know, kind of thing and, and, you know, so junior wear, junior, you know, young, cutesy, you know, the, the, the departure from the dress that the older lady is wearing kind of thing, so the money, the discretionary funds to say, you know, when you go shopping, I'm gonna buy you something that's cute.  Well, well, there was, you know, the--all these different names and levels of clothing 'cause there was the junior miss and junior teens, and then there was missy, then there was debutante, then there was, you know, I was like, all these names and titles for ladies clothing depending on your age at that time and a--and a--and a specific way to dress.  And after you turn sixteen, now you can suddenly wear this and you wouldn't wear heals until you were, you know, graduated, you know, all those kinds of things.  So, this kind of broke that mold, this junior sportswear concept that was suddenly emerging and Willi was great at it.
Story_ID: 505651
Speaker 1: However, having taken on this new partnership now, he had to change and use cloth--fabrics, cotton-rich fabrics from India, so we had to research, kind of research India and see what they were capable of producing in terms of fabrications and in terms of production. Okay?  So it was a new area for me, okay, especially, because I was so into high styling and silk fabrics and, and specialty items, and so to take that talent and utilize it over here with cotton and, and, and sportswear and junior sportswear, that--for young, cutesy girls and not for high fashion couture customers, it was a, a--definitely a, a big transition that I had to go through.  However, we were there.  And that was the first time that I ever went to India and became aware of, of, you know, completely different--I mean, I had gone to Paris [France] and I'd traveled to Europe so, I mean, I had been out of the country, but--
Speaker 2: A completely different culture (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) India--is a totally different side of the world, you know.  And, and, and poor, extremely poor third world, so poor, poor people, so it's, it's, it's, it's a real definite, you know, it's new experience, a different experience from, from any that I had had, a shocker actually, a culture shock if, if, if I could really say it at that point.  But, I was happy that I was able to have that opportunity from--with him because he already had the awareness of that.  That led on to my getting a job with then, then--after have--working--
Speaker 2: What stands out for you at--as--from a training standpoint at your time at WilliWear [WilliWear Ltd.]?  What did you learn from him?
Speaker 1: Well, survival more than anything.  I mean, as I said to you, Willi [Willi Smith] went through several transitions, you know.  At that time, he and his sister--
Speaker 2: Toukie [Toukie Smith].
Speaker 1: Toukie, Doris is her name.
Speaker 2: Doris.
Speaker 1: Toukie, and, and, and it was a fam- very much so a family.  They were a very tight family unit, you know, nana and all--everybody was always involved in what was going on, the traumas, the dramas, the whatevers.  And what was important there was learning how to keep a job, how to get a job and keep a job, how not to get starry-eyed, how not to get so, so caught up in the fanfare and the ego tripping, okay, but to learn that fashion is a business.
Speaker 2: And the time you worked for him, it was 1977?
Speaker 1: No, this was like--
Speaker 2: Seventy-eight [1978]?
Speaker 1: --late '70s [1970s], late '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: Early (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Seventy-nine [1979], '80 [1980].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, like that.  And--but that was what was important--
Speaker 2: To survive.
Speaker 1: --to survive.  And, and he was very grounded.  We're both Pisces, so we were just--clicked right up front, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now--
Story_ID: 505652
Speaker 1: Did you meet [HistoryMaker] Alvin Bell during the time you worked there [WilliWear Ltd.] because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Alvin--
Speaker 1: --they were friends?
Speaker 2: Yes, Alvin was around.  And these were just people that were around, you know, Scott Barrie--
Speaker 1: Now, let me ask this.  Had Alvin done the fashion report [Designer Report]?  Was he working on that trend casting fashion report?
Speaker 2: I don't recall.
Speaker 1: You don't remember.
Speaker 2: I don't recall.  I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --again, a lot of these people were just friends--
Speaker 1: Around, okay.
Speaker 2: --and names, and they were around.
Speaker 1: So, who were--who was around?
Speaker 2: Everyone was just doing their thing kind of sort of.  And, again, I mean, no one--
Speaker 1: You were gonna name some people that were around, that were in the same--
Speaker 2: Yeah, no one's named had emerged as such, okay.  It was just a unique thing to just--you know, to, to, to walk out on 7th Avenue [New York, New York] and see a black face, period no matter what they were doing, okay.  And so that's what I'm saying, so for there to be a Scott Barrie, great.  What is he doing, to what extent or whatever, I don't know, but I'm glad he's here.  And there's Scott Barrie--I mean, there's John Hagens [ph.] and Raven Chanticleer, okay, and--you know, everyone was just emerging and making names for themselves and just doing different things from different directions, okay, and you would just hear about someone here now and then, there.  You didn't know what their struggles were.  You didn't know if they were making it or how they were making it--
Speaker 1: Right.  But collectively, was, was there a place where you met like the Amer- you know, when you were in Paris [France], you had the American Center [Paris, France].  Was there a place for blacks who were working on, you know, 7th Avenue to convene and talk about the day and work and how difficult it was for African Americans trying to break into this business on 7th Avenue?   Where did you go (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) If I had to--
Speaker 1: --to, like, let it out.
Speaker 2: If I had--If I had to say--I think people pretty much met on an individual basis as friendships would form.  The--I mean, some people are for you and some are not.  They--you know, the, the women, you know, in, in the area, you know, Miriam Williams [ph.] and what was her name?  There was another name, Judith [ph.]--a name--Judith something.  Oh, I can't remember all of them.  It was--you know, so, so I mean, Constance Saunders was another one.  There was--there were--but, I think everyone was kind of in their own pocket, in their own area trying to make it, trying to hold on, you know.  There was a guy named John Wainwright [ph.] who was an assistant to Pauline Trigere, okay.  You know, you would just pass them on the avenue.  You know, 7th Avenue is like that.  When you wake up in the morning, when you walk into the building, you don't come back out until eight or nine o'clock at night, you know what I'm saying?  So, you don't really have that much opportunity to communicate with others, you know, or, or whatever 'cause you're locked into your, you know, wherever you work.  But if we were to come, you know, upon one another, you know, we, we, we would, you know, greet one another and maybe have some exchange or one would introduce, you know--so, I mean, I went up to Scott Barrie's and hung out and then that's when I met Naomi Sims, you know, who was just, again, nobody who was just there, you know.  In fact, I was shocked because Naomi had a, a beauty mark on her, like a birthmark on her cheek at that time and she had really short hair, and she was so tall and skinny.  And he introduced her and he says, "Oh, Len [HistoryMaker Leonard Davis], this is my friend, Naomi."  And I said, "Hi."  And he said, "She's a fashion model."  And I looked at her and I was like, oh, she's gonna have a tough time (laughter), just to myself.  I says--because I'm thinking of long hair, I'm thinking of all these things that--of the European fashion models at the time, and I was like, she's a fashion--she's a--you know, oh, boy, poor thing.  She's gonna have a hard time.  So, again, you know, it was what we shared with one another as we were able to get together, you know, the black designers that were emerging at the time.
Story_ID: 505662
Speaker 1: We're talking about you leaving WilliWear [WilliWear Ltd.], but you- now your, your first professional job that, like your map marker.  This is what put you on the map.
Speaker 2: Right.  So, after--
Speaker 1: Leaving Willi (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) After leaving Willi, I think I went through a few transitions, a few, few, sort of incidental jobs in, in, in between there.  However, I finally landed an interview with a company, Adrianna Papell.  Now, we're talking 7th Avenue [New York, New York] again, okay.  The high fashion market, 530 7th Avenue, okay, and they only worked in silk fabric.  They had an opening for the designer for the blouse division, doing silk blouses, so I applied for that job.  And the merchandiser who was there, a girl named Susan [ph.], was the one conducting the interviews.  She saw me.  She was just very nonchalant.  She flipped through my book, whatever, didn't really react.  "We'll get back in touch with you." Never heard from her.  Approximately a year later, a friend told me of a possible way in which you could get a job.  Don't sit around waiting for a job to appear in Women's Wear Daily.  Place an ad in Women's Wear Daily.  Place your own ad soliciting for a job.  So I took that advice and I placed an ad in positions wanted, designer, blouse designer, dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, for--trying to elicit--that, that job.  Lo and behold, this is a year later, the owner of the company, Harvey Berkman, called and responded to the ad that was in the paper.  He didn't know me.  I went to the office and had an appointment, an interview, with the owner of the company, Harvey, who saw my portfolio and flipped.  I was not impressed because I told him, "Well, I've been here before," and he said, "You have?  Who did you see?"  I said, "I'm not sure what her name was, I think Susan."  Well, he called over to the studio and had Susan come over.  When she walked in the door, she saw me and we greeted one another.  So, he said, "You two know each other?"  And she said, "Yeah, I remember him."  He said, "And you saw this book?"  And she was like, "Yeah."  "And you hired this other guy Jonathan [ph.]?"  And she says, "Well, I felt that he was right for the job at the--."  "And my business has plummeted because you hired some--."  "Well, I thought that he fitted into, to our team."  "This is not a social club.  Are you crazy?  And you had access to someone talented like this and you hired him?  Fire him immediately and hire him tomorrow." So she was livid, livid.  But that was his order.  So, within a couple of days, I started working at Adrianna Papell under these circumstances.  She hated me every day that I was there and I was there for five years. Every day.  She tried every trick in the book to get me fired, but their business doubled, quadrupled.  They had a blouse division and a dress division, and they reached a point--and dresses is what was really their business, was the dresses, but then they reached a point at which the blouses exceeded the--the blouse--the sale of--blouse sales exceeded dress sales.
Story_ID: 505663
Speaker 1: And so I was there [Adrianna Papell], I don't know, holding on, being tortured, but nevertheless, I was holding on.  And as it turns out, as fate would have it, one day I received a call from a headhunter who told me that the company, Chaus [Bernard Chaus, Inc.], was looking for a new design--a designer for their blouse division.  Their blouse business was terrible.  Now, Chaus was a very big multimillion dollar company like Liz Claiborne, like Jones New York, and they were on 7th--they were on Broadway, however, not 7th Avenue [New York, New York], you know the rule.  But this headhunter, Vivienne Darrow is her name, contacted me and said, are you interested in making a change?  Well, I was so threatened at this job and so--I mean, happy that I had the job, I was holding onto the job and I was able to perform, and so then you feel a threat when someone whispers to you in the dark and goes, do you wanna come over here?  You're like, unh-uh, you know, I don't--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You know, no, no, no, no, no, no.  But she persuaded me.  It's a conversation.  It, it--they want to talk to you.  They want you.  She said, "I'm a headhunter for a thousand years.  I don't get such requests.  They didn't ask me to find someone for the job, they pinpointed who they want.  They said, 'Vivienne, get him.  That's who we want.'"  So, I was like, okay, I'm in demand?  Holy God.  So, I went.  The company is owned by a husband and wife, Bernard Chaus and his wife, Josephine Chaus.  Josephine pretty much is the design director for all divisions.  She's the last word.  Bernie Chaus was really more so a businessman, okay, conducting business.  I went and met with Josephine.  I took some sketches, you know, whatever.  And so she--I guess she was already convinced, but we went through the process, through, through the interview, you know, process.  In any event, she turned around and said, "Would you be willing to come here if I would--if, if I--I'm offering you the job.  Are you willing to make the change?"  And I told her, well, I was a little nervous because I didn't--I was--I didn't even wanna to come out to, to meet.  I mean, I, I was too afraid that word would leak back to the job that I was looking for a job, and I was not looking for a job.  I was not unhappy.  So, she said to me as I said, "Could I think about it?"  She says, "Well, I'll say it to you this way.  I don't know what you're getting where you are, but I will double it if you'll come here."  So, now, that's just a blank check, actually, you know.  So then I says, well, okay, I'll think about it.  Thought about it, yes.  So I was--I had turned around and right away, I'm just like, oh, oh, okay, I guess so, yes.  So, now I'm suddenly head designer for a division at Chaus.
Speaker 2: And you're how old?  Twenty-nine?
Speaker 1: Yeah, like right at thirty, like early thirties, early thirties 'cause I had been at Adrianna Papell for about five years (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Five years.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, you're head designer at Chaus.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm trying--well, okay, yeah.  That's--but, anyway, at Chaus.  So, I was there--oh, boy, so that was a brand new experience at Chaus.  Everything was going great.  And I think about four years into that experience of being at Chaus, I then--I think I was thirty-two--yeah, I was thirty-two because when--I was there--'cause I think when I was--I moved here when I think I was like thirty-six.  I had saved up enough money to, to, to, to buy an--get an apartment.  That's what I was saving for, to buy an apartment and not to rent an apartment.  In any event, the point is, Bernard Chaus, the husband, had an aneurysm and died.  And so rather than go out of business, what his wife, Josephine, did was she shrunk the business, so she closed various divisions so that she could just shrink the business to a controllable size for herself.  And so they closed the blouses and they closed dresses and so on, so my division was terminated.
Story_ID: 505664
Speaker 1: So there I was, again, for the--well, for the first time actually on the street looking for a job.  But I think a--you know, a valuable commodity that was out there, you know, and now I was a (gesture) blouse designer, okay, because of my Adrianna Papell experience working for Saks Fifth Avenue and Nieman Marcus and having clothing in those top level stores, blouse, silk blouses, three hundred dollars a--at a clip.  And then moving over to a moderate company that didn't do the expensive blouses but they did volume, huge numbers.  So there's a--they have real estate, Chaus [Bernard Chaus, Inc.] real estate in all the major department stores.  So, like a Liz Claiborne or a Jones New York of today, you know, that was a permanent fixture everywhere across the board, a big name.  So, coming into the market, back into the job pool, everybody was like, you know, come this way, you know.  So I had a number of job offers as you could imagine.  And so I went to Liz Claiborne.  There were so many powerful people at Liz, so many barracudas.  There was so much stress.  There was so much at, at Liz that I wasn't prepared for that.  It, it was more than I could understand.  There were too many people there who were all, you know, just doing their own thing and so many political games going on, so it, it just wasn't for me.  So, I didn't--I didn't stay there long.  I went then to Donnkenny [Donnkenny, Inc.]--no, it was a company called Oak Hill [Oak Hill Sportswear Corporation], Oak Hill.  I went to Oak Hill because they hired me because they wanted to start a blouse division.  They were not in the blouse business and they wanted to start a blouse division and so they hired me to start a blouse division.
Speaker 2: What do you consider your signature blouse?
Speaker 1: I don't--I don't--there's--I don't think I have a signature blouse as such from that time period because, you know, I mean, you know, you do it and then you move on.  I mean, so something was, was selling, it was popular for a moment and we, we--you know, you revised it and revised it and revised it, that particular style, but then it died, as fashion does, and then you have a new creation and you can change that and, and revise that as many times as you like until that stops, and you move on.  So, I, I mean, just--my answer to the question is, you know, I'm just saying I've had many successful styles, but not what I would consider a signature style as such.  Because blouses are still accessories, you know what I'm saying.  It's not your total outfit.  It's an accessory.  So if you have put yourself into that category as a blouse designer as it were, then you have to study the look that's going on and what the accessory is to the look, you know.  So that's what--you know, so that's what's important.  And, and, and again, that has its own--its own skill, the, the eye to, to, to determine what that is at the right time.  However, so I ended up at Donnkenny, at Oak Hill, which merged with Donnkenny.  And then what we were doing were themes.  What became popular at the time was shirts with cats and moons and, and scenes of Santa Claus and snow and, and, and themes from different periods, different, you know, of, of the year.  You know, so there was--we had Christmas shirts, Halloween, you know, all these different themes of--for, for--seasonal shirts on, on denim or whatever fabric, so that was very popular at that moment.  And I and a team of, of, of other designers that were there, we were all good at it, you know.  And so then I went on to that.  Now, that led on to the experience of working out of India again.  And so they, they were happy because I had already been to India and I had already had the experience of working at the factories in India, so that helped a lot.  After that, okay, now what happened wa- then, that trend--that trend slowed down, okay, and once again, it's time to get back out there again.
Story_ID: 505665
Speaker 1: Having gone to India several times at that point, I then started working for a variety of different Indian-owned companies.  Again, it, it--the fact is that as you go through these transitions of getting different jobs or whatever, you need to just get out there and get a job, okay.  And in my experience, what I felt that I have learned was, I--it was easier for me to--I mean, I worked in the larger corporate companies, corporate environments where there's all the various divisions and all these levels of people, okay, and I find it more comfortable to work in smaller companies where I'm perhaps doing everything, okay, but at least I'm not there dealing--90 percent of my time is not spent, you know, wading through politics, you know.  I'm really there just designing and getting the job done, you know, and enjoying my work, you know, rather than all the other that takes place during the course of a day, okay, to, you know, to get something out there, you know, with everybody (gesture) vying for that, you know, popularity or the notoriety or the, the wisdom that I knew more than you knew, you know, that thing.  So I worked for a number of smaller companies for some time, Indian companies, and then again developing the skill of being able to travel and go to a foreign country and get the job done and come back so then that led on to working for a large Korean firm that I was working for for several years, working in Korea back and forth, working in Korea, Indonesia, China, okay, all of the--the whole Asian sector, the experience, okay.  And then from there, I worked for another company that did everything strictly out of the Philippines.  So, again, I was back and forth, you know, in the Philippines.  So, the experience for me has been that, you know, back to my teaching with Willi [Willi Smith], okay, the wisdom that he gave me--
Speaker 2: Survival.
Speaker 1: --survive, get a job, okay.  So, learn how to travel, how to get the job done, you know, how to have enough going for yourself whereby A, you can get a job, but you can hold on because that's what happens for designers.  You can get a job a lot of times but you can't stay in there.
Story_ID: 505666
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk about some of the--some of the philosophy of like black fashion, where it was and where it is today.
Speaker 2: Something that I have to tell you first, and this, this is a baseline, the experience that a black designer has, okay, in the larger market and a broader market, you have to know this.  When you come in the door, the perception is, okay, and we use the, the word (gesture) ethnic.  You're an ethnic designer, okay, so your color sense, your eye for fit and for proportion and style is (gesture) ethnic, okay.  I learned this at Adrianna Papell because after a year, they--by fluke, I got the job in spite of this girl who didn't want to hire me at the time for social reasons, but okay.  After having gotten the job because the owner insisted that I be hired, okay, I had been working for a good--a solid three years and on a particular day, Saks Fifth Avenue, the buyer, a woman named Janet Zinner, found out--she had this explosion.  Women's Wear Daily said that Pucci [Emilio Pucci] is in, Pucci, the Pucci scarfs, Pucci design is in, hello, do we have any Pucci scarf--Pucci prints?  Well, I didn't know, you know.  She's asking in the showroom.  I'm searching desperately for Pucci prints.  So, they're calling me saying the designer, the, the, the buyer from Saks is--I didn't know.  So, I went up to the Pucci store on 64th Street [New York, New York] I think and bought some Pucci scarfs and studied Pucci for a couple of days and came up with some blouses, the Pucci blouse, Pucci prints.  And so when Ms. Zinner came to the showroom in a couple of days 'cause we're gonna have to work fast, she was ready to see this presentation of Pucci printed blouses that we had that she must have.  Well, they weren't in the showroom, they were at the studio, the workroom where we all worked, which was around the corner.  I was there for three years.  When she came around the corner with Harvey Berkman, the president, Susan [ph.] was there, the other designer was there who did the dresses, and I was standing, and she said, "Hello everyone, hello everyone, where are the blouses?"  She saw them.  "Fabulous.  Now, let me ask you, what's the price," this and that.  "Mr. Berkman, does he have to be here?"  Like, who's this?  And so Harvey says, "Oh, Janet, you don't know?"  And she says, "What?"  "That's Leonard [HistoryMaker Leonard Davis].  That's your designer."  "M- my designer?"  "Yeah, that's who designs the blouses, who has been designing the blouses, the ones that you've been gaga over and selling all this time."  She says, "Well why haven't I--why have I never met him?"  Well, I don't know because she, of course, was always in the showroom working with the salesmen.  At best, she would've met Susan, the merchandiser.  But, you know, you never meet the actual designer 'cause it's always there in the back.  From that day on, our sales volume from Saks Fifth Avenue went down because, "You see, your blouses, the coloring is a little bit askew.  I mean, you, you see, the--see, these look too ethnic.  And see, my girl, she put the blouses on, my ladies are not buying the blouses as much as they were because they don't fit.  And then, see, well, you have to understand.  Well, I mean, you have to accept that black designers--I mean, see, black people are round and white people are flat and so a black designer really doesn't have the aesthetic to fit a blouse on a white person."  So, my only answer to that is, but it's been okay for the past three years and their business has doubled and you've been buying enthusiastically.  At this point, we were practically the entire department.  The whole blouse department was practically 90 percent Adrianna Papell, three hundred dollar silk blouses, and now after she met me, all of the sudden, she wasn't liking the blouses.  So, that's when I learned that aspect of being a black designer, okay, that very often, people do have that idea that your taste level in terms of selecting prints, colors, your proportion is ethnic or you're perceived that way coming in the door.
Story_ID: 505667
Speaker 1: I learned this from Edward Wilkerson, okay, who's at Lafayette 148 [Lafayette 148 New York].  He's selling clothing on a very high end level, expensive clothing.  Expensive clothing are not necessarily sold in the showroom.  They have to go out and do trunk shows.  They have to do the coterie show, these very highly specialized shows because it's occasion, special occasion wear, and it's American couture, for what it's worth, very expensive clothing.  So, they're sold pretty much at trunk shows which are done at the store level, but he, even in his experience has told me, okay, that very often, those high class stores in like Dallas [Texas], they will say, send the line, don't send the designer, okay, because that customer still is a bit--the, the product still gets tainted when they see the designer, the black designer, you see.  So that's just something that we black designers know that you do have to incorporate that added dimension in the whole equation because that's there, spoken, seen or unseen, it's there, it's a perception that is there.  You just have to try to overcome it with your talent, your ability, your, your eye, your proportion, your--you know, you have to overcome it and--but you have--you should know it.  You should not be naive to that.
Story_ID: 505668
Speaker 1: What do you think of urban wear today, what's considered urban wear?  And I'm talking about like FUBU, Rocawear, who are the others, Ecko [Ecko Unltd]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  What's to say?  Again, I'm (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What is to say?
Speaker 2: I'm back to Willi [Willi Smith].  Make a living, okay, get a job, supply the demand that's out there.  And what in fact has happened here is with urban wear, they created a demand, okay.  They created a clothing around a particular musical genre.
Speaker 1: So, for all practical purposes, they didn't wait to read an ad in the paper.  They put an ad in saying this is, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --this is what we're looking for.
Speaker 2: This is what we're looking for.
Speaker 1: This is who we're looking at to buy these clothes.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Now, you know, if you--
Speaker 2: Well, again, the, the--around a particular musical style, they said, okay, fine.  When you're bouncing up and down like this, you should have on your shirt with the alligator, boom, boom.  You should have your shrimp earrings.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You should have this hat and that shoe on.
Speaker 1: But, it's interesting you talked about the, the blouses with like the, the prints, the cats and the moons and the Christmases, and now those hoodies are the same, same element of printed all over.  You've seen the new hoodies--
Speaker 2: Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: --with, you, you know, so I guess the--their element (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, but there's a generational thing going on, too.  So you could say bell bottom pants are popular now, you know what I'm saying?  You could say afro is coming because you got a generation that never wore bell bottom pants.  That's why the Gap [Gap, Inc.] has had their success, the Old Navy because they're constantly selling to a generation that never had the opportunity to wear a pea coat, so they can introduce these things each and every season, each and every year that are just so mundane and ordinary, you go like, I'm not gonna rush in the Gap and buy a five-pocket jean.  I got a five-pocket jean.  But the sixteen-year-old who just turned seventeen who no longer--mom is no longer shopping for her and now she's finally getting her first dollar to shop for herself, here's her opportunity to buy her hoodie.
Story_ID: 505669
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, but has it ever become more to you than or--than just surviving?  Do you still have the same passion for couture that you had when you started?
Speaker 2: Not the word couture as such, but for clothing, yes and for styling, yes.  For having an eye and so having sort of a timing to try to gauge.  The moderate market is a lot harder than the, the upper market because when you're creating fashion, okay, that's an aspect, okay.  You're being creative.  But when you're following fashion, okay, for the moderate consumer, then you have to really put your thinking cap on because she's the day after couture.  I mean, she's, she's down the line.  She's wearing practical clothing.  She's investing in her clothing and it has to be practical in terms of wash and wear, it has to suit her occasions.  What are her occasions?  You know, it has to be priced where she can have the discretionary funds to afford to have whatever it is and it can't be over the top.  If Donna Karan is doing jackets with six buttons, she's only gonna wear four buttons.  She doesn't want to be the first to wear the capri.  She wants to wear it after it's kind of out there.  So, as a designer in the moderate market, you have to have that sense of timing.  You have to follow fashion and know and understand what's going on.
Story_ID: 505670
Speaker 1: Who do you consider to be, including yourself, good black designers today?
Speaker 2: Oh, in terms of--
Speaker 1: And, and you use your own criteria on what you feel is a good black designer today.
Speaker 2: When--here's, here's, here's how I'm trying to answer your question because there was the day that we were talking about a Willi Smith or names, the black designers with their name on the labels--
Speaker 1: And that's what I'm talking about (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know what I'm saying?
Speaker 1: And that's what I'm talking--I mean, that's what I wanna talk about first.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then we'll work our way down.  Black designers with their names on the label, does that exist today?
Speaker 2: Well, I think at this point, it's [HistoryMaker] Tracy Reese and Edward's [Edward Wilkerson] name is not on the label.  He's--for those of us that happen to know who's there, he's there.  And I'm, I'm--at, at this moment, my mind is not clicking on anyone else.
Story_ID: 505671
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, the black designers, there was a point in time when there were several names, you know, hovering out there in terms of black designers who had their names on the label in the early '80s [1980s], you know, early, mid-'80s [1980s].  You could say a, a dozen names, okay, but people died off, people went out of business, and as we entered into the '90s [1990s] and, and 2000, whatever, there's hardly--and Patrick Kelly died.  I mean, you know, I mean, so it just--they just disappeared, you know.  However, what's also important is business has changed, business trends and ways of doing business has changed.  So, there was a point in time where people, you know, who owned their own companies, okay, are the stores like Federated Stores [Federated Department Stores, Inc.; Macy's, Inc.] were ordering merchandise for--you know, from companies at, at, at that point.  But then, see, business--I mean, this has nothing to do with the black or white designers or whatever, but business has changed and so what emerged, you know, evolved to--at this point, it's--whereby it's what we call guaranteed profit, okay.  So a lot of the Federated Stores--
Speaker 2: Want a guaranteed profit (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: -- (simultaneous) want a guaranteed profit, okay, so then those larger companies that are able to adhere to that, okay, could continue to be in the game.
Story_ID: 505672
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, where are you now?  You're working with?
Speaker 2: I'm working at a company now called Tanzara [Tanzara International, Inc.].  I'm design director.  And Tanzara is a Indian--a Indian family owns the company, and we produce all of our product out of India, so I'm back in India once again.  And they--they're a production company, first and foremost, and so they produce product for Chicos which is a large catalog and, and store, and the Avenue [Avenue Stores, LLC] which is a plus size, so they produce product for them as well as they have their own line, which is Tanzara.  So, I'm there in the mix of all of that.  I've been there now so far for three years and life is good.  So, so I, I, I--as I--as I get older and as I continue in the fashion market, I guess I'm constantly anticipating what will I do or when will I retire or what will ever come of me.
Story_ID: 505673
Speaker 1: And some of the things that have happened in--since that time, I have joined several fashion organizations, black fashion organizations.
Speaker 2: Which, which, which ones?
Speaker 1: There was Fashion Outreach [New York, New York], there's FAX, Fashion and Arts Exchange, which I'm a board member.  And what--in fact, with the FAX organization, on three occasions, working with the committee there, I came up with the idea of us creating a black fashion, you know, awards presentation, trying to reach back and get some of the fashion pioneers and acknowledge them.
Story_ID: 505674
Speaker 1: Who do you consider to be the black fashion pioneers?
Speaker 2: In, in that--in categorically, let's say [HistoryMaker] Geoffrey Holder for costume design, Wesley Tann [Wesley Tann, Jr.] because he was the first black business owner on 7th Avenue [New York, New York] shipping under his own label, [HistoryMaker] Ophelia DeVore for fashion, for modeling, for training girls in the early '50s [1950s], started her own business, let's see, pioneers, Audrey Smaltz [HistoryMaker Audrey Lavinia Smaltz].  Audrey is--
Speaker 1: She's at Vogue or she was at Vogue?  She's a editor, Audrey?
Speaker 2: No, Audrey--well, Audrey's fame--
Speaker 1: A stylist?
Speaker 2: Audrey's fame came from Ebony Fashion Fair.  She was the commentator for the Ebony Fashion Fair shows.  And then after her, you know, long term, you know, experience with doing that, then she started a company called The Ground Crew, and The Ground Crew is--produces all the fashion shows for all the big 7th Avenue companies, that 7th on 7th [sic. 7th on 6th] operation, so she's the person behind that that does the dressing, the makeup, the hair, all of that to produce those fashion shows.  She created a company and I think she may have two or three hundred people working for her.
Story_ID: 505675
Speaker 1: There was a black fashion museum in Harlem [New York, New York] at some point.
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm on the board, Audrey's [HistoryMaker Audrey Lavinia Smaltz] on the board, I am also, and Lois Alexander [Lois K. Alexander Lane] who, you know, created the Black Fashion Museum [New York, New York] is, you know, much older now and her daughter [Joyce Bailey] had taken over.  She still--they still have all the costumes that were there, but they closed, had to close, and they moved to Washington [D.C.] where the daughter's living, and they're trying to save that--the, the, the--what's left of the museum and preserve it and see--get some funding and whatever.  That's something that we're trying to create and promote a new black fashion museum because it--especially what Lois had there at the museum, there's so many costumes with all--such historical value, significance, to the black community, and that information should be saved, you know.  I don't know who's gonna be the custodian to warehouse and keep all that stuff so that it can survive, you know, but so far (laughter), it's happening, you know.  So, that's something that we, we hope that, that will continue.  What--so then what we created was an annual presentation to try to acknowledge some of our pioneers (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Pioneers.
Speaker 2: --you know, in modeling like Naomi Sims--
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Pat Cleveland.
Speaker 2: Pat Cleveland also and any--well, you know--
Speaker 1: Iman.
Speaker 2: --Helen, Helen Williams and Dorothea Towles [Dorothea Church], and all of the first prominent, you know, black--
Speaker 1: And [HistoryMaker] Diahann Carroll came through Ophelia's school [Ophelia DeVore School of Self-Development and Modeling, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Right.  She, in fact, was Ophelia DeVore's [HistoryMaker Ophelia DeVore] secretary, you know, when she was like nineteen or something or other, and, and, you know, went on to, to acting and whatever.  But, so those are the people that we try each year--I've had several shows so far.  I mean, one year, we honored Naomi Sims, [HistoryMaker] Susan Taylor and Eileen Ford came--from Ford Modeling Agency [Ford Models] came and presented the award and whatever.  The following year, we honored Andre Leon Talley and Iman presented the award, and a whole array of his personal friends (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What became his claim to fame?  Because he's--
Speaker 2: Andre?
Speaker 1: --a bigger than life, larger than life personality.
Speaker 2: Well, didn't you see 'The Devil Wears Prada'?  Well, again, he's, he's a Vogue editor at large and I think he just hovered around Diana Vreeland at the right time.
Speaker 1: Long enough (laughter).
Speaker 2: And, and he got his wings, got his stripes, you know.  And so once--I, I think if you get into that circle and they endorse you, you know, you, you, you have your way made, you know, from that point on and so--
Speaker 1: You got your wings, so to speak.
Speaker 2: And, and then that's it and you can write your own ticket at that point, so I think that's, that's who launched him.  That's who put him on, on his pedestal and said, okay, fine, continue from here, you know, and that's all he needed, that's--that endorsement.
Speaker 1: Any desire to do couture of your own?
Speaker 2: At this point in the--in the game, what I seem to have segued into more is more production, more fashion show productions and more fashion events, reaching out to the greater black fashion community, wanting to acknowledge our pioneers, wanting to encourage those that are emerging, wanting to reach back or encourage others to reach back and say, okay, fine, so for those of us now who are in our fifties, okay, and maybe not that much longer to be in the industry, let's gather the knowledge that we have, the experience that we have, and reach out, okay, to those that are emerging and encourage them.
Story_ID: 505676
Speaker 1: Who's emerging today that you know of, young talent?
Speaker 2: Young talent.  I mean, I don't know--I mean, there are assistants, there are so many ambitious young black designers that are coming forward, that want to, that at least want to make it.  Business--the, the, the trend of business now is so much different, the way of operating, and I try to encourage people to say that they must try to partner with some of the right people.  A lot of foreign countries support the designers.  They fund the companies, so it's difficult for us here who are struggling to try to build a company when you're competing with someone that just got off the boat who has government money from China, from India, okay, from, from Europe who's been backed by the government and they have the funding to survive, you know, and we're here with no money, you know, thinking, you know, why are you making it and I'm not?  So what's better is for me to realize that at the beginning and partner with you because you're trying to assimilate into American culture and I have that to offer and you have the money, you know what I'm saying?  So, you know, let's partner, okay, and try to build companies that way, which was what, again, back to Willi [Willi Smith], that four partnership deal, that's how he made it finally after going through so many transitions.  You see what I'm saying?  So, I try to, to pass on that wisdom and that knowledge to, you know, all of the young would-be designers who are out there who are thinking that--you know, they hear these fabulous stories from Diane von Furstenberg, "I threw three tops into a suitcase and went up to Vogue and they loved me, and the next thing I knew, I had a three-page spread," woop-de-doo.  It's not gonna happen for you that way, you know what I'm saying?
Story_ID: 505677
Speaker 1: What do you feel have been the contributions of African Americans to the fashion industry as a whole?
Speaker 2: I think that fashion, going back to what I sort of voiced to you as a negative, (gesture) ethnic, okay.  But fashion in and of itself has to--fashion can't be mundane, okay, and simple.  There always has to be that unique twist, that styling, that, that, that hemline, that something, okay.  Arthur McGee was the designer at Halston [Halston Ltd.] for years and nobody knew it, okay.  Taking simple styles and doing something unique with it, okay, ethnic, okay, but it's interesting when ethnic has a white face on it, okay.  What's this girl's name, something Baskin Bey, used to do all that macrame that Mary McFadden produced, okay, (gesture) ethnic.  But when it has a white face, it's fabulous.  When it comes back to us again, then it's (gesture) ethnic and somehow or other that has a taint and so we don't--we dismiss it.  So every day in my business, they say, okay, we have two customers.  There's the white bread customer and the ethnic customer, and so we want both customers at different times, and when they realize that the scale has tipped a little bit too ethnic, then they go, well what about the white bread customer and do you have the ability to appeal to her?  Okay, now I have to rattle my brain to find out well, I know what--I suppose I know what the ethnic customer would like, and when I go up and down to all the stores, when I see Oscar de la Renta, when I see Bill Blass, when I see Michael Kors and, and all these, I think it's ethnic looking, okay.  None of those are black faces, but I see (gesture) ethnic, so I don't see the white bread customer; however, that's what has inundated the floors at Lord and Taylor, Saks [Saks Fifth Avenue], Bergdorfs [Bergdorf Goodman].  So, I still feel that that word, ethnic, really means uniqueness, okay, style, and that's what I go for.  That's what I'm trying to always infuse into what I'm doing, not taking that as something that is culturally negative that I only have to give, but that is, in fact, what is style and that's what Yves Saint Laurent always had to do, Christian Dior, Givenchy, all of the couturiers, style, and if you call it ethnic--Chanel [Coco Chanel] wasn't French.  I mean (laughter) she was Hungarian.  You know what I'm saying?  Everyone comes from an--a cultural background which is (gesture) ethnic and so you add that into what you're doing, you know what I'm saying?  Most everybody who gets inspired goes to Madagascar or to Egypt or someplace and suddenly finds themselves, find what they're looking for and then they come back and--but then they are afraid to use that word, you know.  We try to--but it's still style, you know, so, you just--you can't get away from it and fashion can't continue to evolve if we don't continue to have that style, that sense of what's new, what's next, okay.  So whoever can stem the tide and continue to change fashion, okay, the direction that fashion is going in, that's what it's all about, and it's not always commercial, okay.  Sometimes it's at the street level, okay.  Tommy Hilfiger never expected that African Americans--he wasn't designing for African Americans to wear his clothing, okay, urban--it, it was not his expectation or his goal, but it was just the hip-hop culture that went into names, labels, the whole dynasty, the whole feeling of wanting to be rich, get rich or die trying.  So then, what is the interpretation of rich?  What's that drink, that Puffy [Sean Combs; P. Diddy] made popular, every--all of his songs, you know, I'm gonna have--
Speaker 1: Courvoisier?
Speaker 2: Courvoisier, you know, Cristal?
Speaker 1: Cristal, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, Cristal.  So then Cristal was not on the map until Puffy came along, again, with the notion that you're gonna drive in a Hummer, you're gonna be drinking Cristal like water.  And so the urban market brought that notion about that this is top drawer.  This is the definition of rich.
Story_ID: 505678
Speaker 1: What do you think has been your contribution to fashion?
Speaker 2: At the moment, I think the fact (laughter), my contribution has been to just be a beacon out there for people that I've come into contact with to realize, strangely enough, you always seem to have a job, interesting.  And I say, yes, you don't always--you don't seem to be struggling, and wherever I've gotten a job, I've always managed to survive for at least a four to five year period and they want to know how and why.  And so I'm always more than willing to share that advice, that wisdom with anybody that wants to listen.
Speaker 1: Which is what Willi [Willi Smith] said to you?
Speaker 2: Which is exactly what Willi said to me, God bless the dead, Willi Smith, you know, who shared that with me at that point in time to say it's a business, it's your life, you have to live.  No one can ever find you on skid row no matter how talented you may be, so you have to be wise enough to go through the door that is open.  You can knock on every other door, but if they don't open, if it's not available to you, then go through the door that's open, okay.  So in my case, I knocked on the couture doors and none of them were opening, okay.  And so his advice to me was, stop waiting around.  Here's an open door, come on in.  Do you wanna come in?  So, come on in this door.  You're in.  And adjust your talent to the position that's available to you.  If you're talented, you're going to excel anyway.  You're gonna survive anyway, so just come on in and perform, you know.  And I, I had to adjust to that.  I had to learn that that's--that was my plight.  That was my lot.  That was where I needed to be and to, to learn that, okay, you're talented at every level, I'm saying, but just come on in and apply yourself and use your talent and your ability where you are.
Story_ID: 505679
Speaker 1: Well, when you look back over your career, what stands out as one of the greatest highlights?
Speaker 2: The greatest highlight in fashion.  Going to--
Speaker 1: And we'll end with this.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, well, I think the greatest highlight--I don't know.  It's been so varied at this point because, I mean, I enjoyed that opportunity to be in Paris [France], and I've been back to Paris many times since that time to study.  That, that was invaluable.
Speaker 1: Well, what does--what does your mom [Cleo Williams Davis] and dad [Jordan Davis, Sr.] think about what they--what you've become?
Speaker 2: What do they think of, of--I think that they're proud.  I think that they're happy that I--that they gave me, okay, the inspiration, the, the, the impetus, the, the money, the funds, the support, okay to follow my dream, okay.  They never thought it was too much, it was too high, it was too, you know, outrageous for me to aim high.  And so because mom, okay, got excited about me drawing sketches for article in the school newspaper, here I am today.  So, you realize how important it is that your parents can prepare--propel you into a career that you never really anticipated, but that's all you need is a just a little bit of encouragement and a little bit of love from the people that love you, and this is the only person that loves me.  And so it's--right from the beginning, I've just been blessed and fortunate to have my beautiful mom and dad to encourage me and my whole family unit, that we've all been very tight and very supportive of one another, and very encouraging to one another to reach for the top, aim for the best, want more, want to be the best that you can be, and encourage others and reach back and pull as many along with you as you can.  That's the only way we're gonna survive.

Speaker 1: So I'm going to end, end this interview usually the way I start, but I didn't start with you this way, so I'll end with you this way.  Your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Soul food, I guess.
Speaker 1: Your favorite time of day?
Speaker 2: Three o'clock in the morning.
Speaker 1: Your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Orange.
Speaker 1: Your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I don't have one because I've never been on vacation because I've been working twenty-four hours a day (laughter) my whole life, so I don't know the meaning of the word vacation, but--
Speaker 1: Your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Christmas.
Speaker 1: And your favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Favorite phrase.  At church, they said, the will to do will make a way, and it took me a while to interpret that because it didn't quite jive when I first heard it, but I finally got it.  The will to do will make a way, so I've lived by that.
Story_ID: 505681
Speaker 1: Today is the 22nd of June, 2007.  We're here with [HistoryMaker] Leonard Davis.  Can I ask you to state your whole name and spell it?
Speaker 2: My name is [HistoryMaker] Leonard Davis, L-E-O-N-A-R-D, D-A-V-I-S.
Speaker 1: Can I ask you to tell us where we are?
Speaker 2: We're in my apartment in New York City [New York, New York] on East 30th Street.
Speaker 1: I am the videographer, Adrienne Jones, and Neculai [Neculai Burghelea] is the--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): It's the other way around, but that's okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm the worst slater.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): No that's all right, you're--
Speaker 1: And I'm nervous about Neculai's name.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): No, no.
Speaker 1: I am the interviewer, Adrienne Jones, and our videographer (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): (Simultaneous) Neculai--
Speaker 1: --is Neculai--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Burghelea.
Speaker 1: --Burghelea, thank you.
Speaker 2: Okay, and both of you, welcome to my home.
Story_ID: 505682
Speaker 1: So, today we're gonna talk about your collection and I wanna start off by asking you, how did you start collecting black memorabilia?
Speaker 2: Okay, it's, it's kind of a strange story.  I--for many years after I began working and struggling to search for a job, I was living in a small little studio on, on, on the west side of 24th Street, and with various opportunities to move into apartments, I kind of waited because I really wanted a nice apartment, and I didn't wanna rent.  I guess I had listened to a lesson from someone, like buy it if you can.  Don't rent, buy, buy.  Well, now you need money.  So, I was working and saving to try to have at least a substantial--a substantial down payment to be able--to be able to afford to buy an apartment.  Living in Manhattan [New York], not likely, right, and so I thought, okay, I was looking in Brooklyn [New York], I was looking in Queens [New York], what have you, and a friend of mine finally had a friend who just started working for a real estate broker, and it was his first shot, first shot.  And this apartment was a foreclosure, and that guy had, you know, access to that information and found out that I was looking for an apartment.  Then, we got together, et cetera, et cetera, boom, I got it.  So, now this is my first ever apartment (laughter), so I was so thrilled (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A home.
Speaker 2: I got here.  I'm home.  I have a home now, okay.  Now, what do I do?  What do I do?  I've always dreamed of having a sizeable place.  It's--so it's, it's a large living room, it's two bedrooms, two bathrooms, I'm on, okay.  But I--Leonard [HistoryMaker Leonard Davis], no junk.  I'm gonna try to get some nice stuff, okay.  So I wanted to have some art and everyone said African art, African art, but I kept saying unh-uh.  I'm African American, so I didn't want African art, I wanted African American.  Now, what's that?  Okay.  Well, I love Nat King Cole, you know, Sarah Vaughan, Lena Horne, you know, entertainers, but then there's other people, there's this Paul Laurence Dunbar, you know, what bit of African American history I may have known, okay.  Then, I said, okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What year--what year is this that you--
Speaker 2: The year--
Speaker 1: --purchased the apartment?
Speaker 2: I came here I think in ninety--'89, 1989.  And so I was like, wow, you know.  I kept, like not, not taking that first step because I really wanted my first piece to be something fabulous, something fabulous and something of value.  Okay, now, another lesson I hear from people is, if you get good art, okay, it's valuable and it's an investment, so it's appreciating.  As you enjoy it, as it sits on your wall, it's also appreciating.  Your investment is appreciating and so if you have it for five years, for ten years, like a Romare Bearden, okay, like a Paul Lawrence Jacob [sic. Jacob Lawrence], it will appreciate in value over time, so it's a good investment, okay.  I was keeping that in mind as well.  So on my--therefore, I was saying, what will I do?
Story_ID: 505683
Speaker 1: I saw a TV show where they interviewed maids, and as they interviewed ladies who cleaned homes, this agency stated that the ladies had a little sort of game that they would play sometimes amongst themselves as they would chat.  Because typically what they did was, they would come to the agency and just take keys.  They would collect a set of keys and go out on assignment, okay, and typically what they could do was, they would open a door, okay to the perspective--to the--to the client's home, to come and clean.  The client very often was not at home, okay.  But they upon opening the door and taking a quick glance around could tell the ethnicity of the owner.  And typically they were saying, typically you--if you saw a menorah and a so and so and a so and so, they were Jewish.  If you saw sconces and whatever, they were most likely Italian.  But if you saw this one, they're most--they could pretty much guess the ethnicity of the owner.  The hardest to guess was always African American because African Americans most often did not have any images around their homes that reflected themselves.  I didn't want to be guilty of that.  So then I came home and started looking right away and I was like, okay, okay, Betty Boop has to go, okay, Cinderella, gotta go, duck, swans, birds, gotta go, gotta go.
Speaker 2: What did you look for first?
Speaker 1: I, I, I didn't really know, but I just--I just, oh, I have to have black images then.  If anybody hits this door, they gotta know somebody black lives here.  Okay, that's it.  Now I got it.  Now, now I'm on the track.  But then I was looking for valuable.  I was looking for something that was art, that was art--an investment in art.  I said, now what am I gonna do?  So then I started--I went with a friend one day to the flea market and I saw a lot of people hovering around, bargaining, fighting over one individual piece, okay, which was a cookie jar.  And I wondered, my gosh, why is everybody--well, what is it?  And I'm trying to peak over and it was this little Aunt Jemima cookie jar.  And people were going, I'll give you five hundred for it.  And a lady said no, I'll make--I'll give you a thousand.  And I was like, oh my God, for that?  So that kind of taught me something.  And the dealer afterwards told me, I've got several cookie jars here, but the rarest one is always the black one.  If you ever see a collection, a grouping of things, if they ever made one in black face, that's always the valuable one, you'll see.  And that taught me something.  So then I was like, wow, so the first piece that I got was a cookie jar, a Aunt Jemima cookie jar.  I bought it at the flea market.
Story_ID: 505684
Speaker 1: And why is the black face cookie jar always the most valuable?
Speaker 2: Because they're rare.  Because if, if--let's say typically when ceramic companies were making items of that sort, it was just something that they would perhaps do once or twice in a run, if they would make a series of, of, of a dozen jars or whatever, they would only make one, you see.  And so if that one sold or whatever, that's it, you see.  Because they didn't--the assumption was not that the consumer, okay, was really interested in buying a black face jar and typically they didn't sell, okay, so it was really not a product that the consumer, the intended consumer, okay, which was not us, okay, so the intended consumer, it was not this--a product that, that--it was assumed that the intended consumer was, was interested in.
Story_ID: 505685
Speaker 1: And at what time does Aunt Jemima pancakes start advertising with Aunt Jemima and possibly making these types of items, the advertisements and the cookie jars and the--
Speaker 2: Okay, and for--and for Aunt Jemima, now, Aunt Jemima in particular, that story is that something about the fact that the, the, the producers of that product at the turn of the century, okay, when, well let's say Mr. Kellogg, Mr. Post were coming up with this new invention which was a, a dry--a cereal and you just add milk, okay, but it was nutritious and it was instant, okay.  Then, Cream of Wheat was there and then the pancake mix suddenly came along.  And so it was at a point in time when industrialism was going on and people were coming up with these various inventions, but then your product, okay, had to have a, a logo, a name, a face, okay, that was going to sell to the--to the public and so it's kind of--the concept was we have a product, pancakes.  Who makes the best pancakes?  Okay and these are instant pancakes, so in actuality, you will be making them, okay, but they should taste like what?  Like who?  So, the best cook in the world was your maid, the black maid, the black mammy in the kitchen from the Old South.  It was just that American notion that she's the best cook that there is.  So then some very smart producer, promoters, okay, advertising geniuses thought, hum, if we put that notion and we put that face on the box and the--and the first actual person that portrayed the image of Aunt Jemima because there was never an actual Aunt Jemima.  Aunt Jemima is just a, a--sort of a, a phrase.  It's just sort of a nickname that was given to old southern women in the South rather than try to figure out, remember your name or whatever, all of them were auntie, auntie, you know what I'm saying.  Every, every old woman was auntie, every old man was uncle.  So, auntie, Aunt Jenny, Aunt Jemima, Aunt--auntie.  It was--it was just a common southern name for old black women.  And so Aunt Jemima, I think at the time there was a play on Broadway [sic.], 'Aunt Jemima Slide' ['The Aunt Jemima Slide'].  I even have the sheet music for it, and so it was just a common name that was around and it would--it would just again--just say--it would mean an old fat black woman, an Aunt Jemima.  She's an Aunt Jemima.  But she's again--she's that faithful figure in your home.  Typically, she probably raised you, okay.  She may have even breastfed you.  You were raised by her.  You love her.  She loves you and she keeps your home.  She--she's there and she's a trusted, respected figure.  She's your psychiatrist, she was your wet nurse, she's your doctor, she's your, your, your grandmother, okay, for what it's worth, okay, in the psyche of American people at that point in time.  So imagine her image on that product box to say that's who made these.  That--if you use this product, it will be as if she made them.  You will--it will taste--but you can do it.  So now, it's the turn of the century.  The, the idea of having a maid and a cook and all of that stuff, it's no longer, it's no longer.  The, the, the Beulah is no longer in the kitchen now.  Times have changed, okay, so this is how we brought her forward.  Now, Beulah is in the box, okay.  And so that's why we're using that image.  Again, realize, that product has the black image on the--on the box, okay, but this is a product that is not being advertised to the black consumer.  That was not the intention.  The intention was that we just wanted you to just realize that you trusted her, okay, and so that's why you're willing to buy this product, assuming that it's gonna taste as if she made it, the person that you trust, the Cream of Wheat that you trust, Rastus on Cream of Wheat, Uncle Ben that you trust as a very, very--the best cook.  This product will make you the best cook just like them, someone that you know.  But that product was not being advertised to the black consumer as the end user.  That was never the intention.  However, it was not a negative, also.  It was--the, the, the image, the black image on those products was not also put on there as a negative, okay.  It was put on there because this was a trusted figure that everyone knew for a food item.  This is gonna taste great if you have it in your mind that this Cream of Wheat product, this oatmeal is gonna taste good if you buy it because it's in your mind that he made it.  So that--I just wanted to put that point across.

Speaker 1: So where did you get your first cookie jar?
Speaker 2: At the flea market on--it used to be a flea market and it's not there any longer, but used to be on 6th Avenue and 26th Street [New York, New York], okay.  Every Saturday and Sunday morning I think they would start something like five o'clock in the morning setting up and I would be there at five o'clock in the morning (laughter).
Speaker 1: And once you buy an item, do you determine where it came from or--
Speaker 2: That, you learn.
Speaker 1: --what year it's from?
Speaker 2: That's what you learn.
Speaker 1: So, what year was your first cookie jar from?
Speaker 2: My first cookie jar was a Weller [Weller Pottery] cookie jar, very valuable, as I came to find out.  It was--well, actually, the Weller, it was a ceramic company that was around in the mid--I think they started mid-1800s and they survived up through the, the early 1900s.  They made these jars primarily as a, a promotion for the Aunt Jemima company at the time.  They only made 144 sets--
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: --and they gave--and which, and which consisted of six pieces and they gave these 144 sets to all the executives of the Aunt Jemima product company, hoping to do--get a contract as a premium, okay.  Now, competing with them at that time was F&F Die and Mold Company [sic. F&F Mold and Die Works] who also produced a cookie jar that was plastic, okay.  And so, therefore, the plastic jar won out because it's lightweight, doesn't matter if you break it or not (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It didn't break (laughter).
Speaker 2: It was free, they could ship it, they could put it inside the, you know, the box, so that won out as--because this is a freebie.  It was a premium that you would get with, with two purchases or whatever.
Speaker 1: You said this was a set of six?
Speaker 2: But they--
Speaker 1: So each executive would have six?
Speaker 2: They gave them out as a--as a promotion to, to try to, to, to gain this contract.  They gave them to--you know, this is a free gift to the--to the--to the--all of the executives there at Aunt Jemima, you know, just to see if they--if there was an interest, to create--to try to create an interest.  But ultimately, you know, they didn't get the contract and everyone kept them and then who needed them, whatever, and they just sort of got, you know, given away, thrown away, whatever.  And so for a collector a hundred years later to be able to reassemble that whole six piece set, okay, from that point in time (gestures) is (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Have you done that?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Fantastic (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I have the whole s- Weller set.
Speaker 1: So, perhaps you'll show us that set.
Speaker 2: Yes, oh, sure, I'll be glad to show it to you.
Story_ID: 505687
Speaker 1: So, what was the second item that you proceeded to purchase?
Speaker 2: So, then from there, then I got crazy 'cause now I'm off and running and I have something of value and a few friends dropped by and go, "Woo, wow, what's that?  Where did you get it?  I want one."  So that's all people ever have to say to you, it's like, you got it and I want it, too.  Like if anybody else wants it, now I'm on, you know.  So, then I started--then I started collecting toys, segregation signs.  I started meeting other collectors.  I started communicating with the dealers at the flea market and I started learning what was of significance, what was of value?  Tobacco humidors, okay, are something that are unique from a point in time, of course, when people were, were, were--tobacco was loose, okay, so you didn't have readymade rolled cigarettes.  And primarily, a lot of men smoked pipes, okay, and cigars which, of course, had to be rolled as well.  So, tobacco came loose and it kept--was--to keep it fresh, you would keep it in the--in the tightly sealed tobacco humidors.  So as you would sit back in your easy chair, you would sit there and take some tobacco and roll it and--or stuff it down in your pipe, you know, this thing, so your humidor was always sitting there in your--on your table next to your smoking chair, you see.  So, then what happened was, they started to fashion those tobacco humidors in various different figural ways and so I have a whole collection of black tobacco humidors, cookie jars.  Our images were placed on many different types of products to sell products.  There's Luzianne coffee.  There's--I have--I have coffee cans.  I have tea.  I have soap, detergent products of sorts.
Story_ID: 505688
Speaker 1: Now, some are negative images as well, okay, and the brand names have--a, a brand name tomatoes called Nigger Head Tomatoes, okay.  And this is a product company out of Baltimore [Maryland] that made, you know, well, well--I think it's seafood primarily.  There, there, there was Nigger Head Tomatoes, shrimp, they had and oysters.  Then also, a tobacco company had Nigger Hair, Nigger Hair Tobacco [Nigger Hair Smoking Tobacco], okay, loose, nig- Nigger Hair, Nigger Hair Tobacco, okay.  And, however, for a lot of products that portrayed blacks in a negative image, with the advent of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], okay, a lot of that changed.  In the '40s [1940s] when, when, when all the advocacy groups started coming forward, they started realizing that we were not in control of our image, that someone else was telling us who we are, pre- giving us--I, I guess there, there was a slogan at the time, they conceived it and we believed it, okay.  We were told that we were mammies.  We were told that we were chefs and cooks, that we could never rise above that.  We, we were given an image to emulate and that's what you were supposed to be.  There was--you were funny, you, you did that funny shuffle dance thing, all of you did.  And so as one would meet, you--they would assume, okay, fine, you, you--here's that nice colored guy, say something funny and make us laugh, you see?  And because that's the image that was given to you, that's who you are, okay, so be the person that I'm expecting.  So, once we took back control of our image, then we started realizing, these products were around about us and realized, no, no, no, no, unh-uh.  We're not gonna tolerate this any longer.
Speaker 2: So, do you get a negative response from people ever about having collected African American memorabilia and what do you say to people who have what is generally a negative assumption of such memorabilia?
Speaker 1: Right.  Now, let me just stop you right now because for collectors, we take issue with the word memorabilia.  For us, it's Americana, and it actually is Americana.  Betsy Ross created the American flag.  So, let's think about it, is the American flag, therefore, the original American flag, could you have--if you had the, the Betsy Ross American flag that she actually hand stitched itself, is that Betsy Ross memorabilia?  That's Americana.  That's an actual person that lived and that created something that did something and, and her whole life. That's Americana.  That's not Betsy Ross memorabilia.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: So, therefore, as we see these items and these objects, okay, these are examples of how Africans came to America and survived and trans- many of the negative things that we had to--the obstacles that we had to endure to survive.  And the--at a point in time when we were not in control of our image, okay, and the transition of the point at which we took control of our image and, therefore, it, it, it begs the question, what have we done with it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's my next question. W-
Speaker 1: --and where are we today?
Story_ID: 505689
Speaker 1: What do you feel about our control over our image at present?
Speaker 2: Once a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Particularly perhaps on--let's talk about TV videos.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Well, present day, again, it, it has its own thing and I think that, that what, what's important and, and just really stand to the subject of collecting, it's--rather than try to transcribe, okay, and, and, and understand what is going on right now because it's like a photographer to chronicle what's going on rather than try to interpret it but just collect it and, and--because collectors are custodians, okay.  It's not something that everyone's willing to do.  And, and just your, your question, how do people react when they come?  Many people come and they're enlightened, they're, they're surprised, they're amazed, and other people come and they're absolutely incensed.  I've had the full, the extreme of both reactions to, to my collection.  Many young people who never knew that there was a time when you could not shop in a regular department store.  They never knew that there was a time when African Americans if you could shop in a store could only go to the first floor and not upstairs.  You could never try on an item.  You could never return anything that you had purchased if you purchase a, a, a garment or a item of clothing, a pair of gloves or something like that.  Once you touched it, okay, it was tainted and the store could never have a reputation that a black woman came in and tried on a dress because perhaps she didn't buy it and then they couldn't--they couldn't imagine the white customer to come in and think someone black had that dress on before I tried it on, no.  Okay, they would be out of business immediately.  So, these are things that young people today never heard.  And it's one thing to give the oral history.  It's another thing to have the tangible evidence to show someone, yes, this is true, to have a segregation sign, okay, white only, colored only, colored this way, colored drinking fountain this way, white drinking fountain that way.  It--it's one thing to hear it, but it's another thing to see it.  There was a restaurant during the '40s [1940s] called the Coon Chicken Inn. And the Coon Chicken Inn used a logo of a big smiling coon face with a little monkey hat on.  This huge facade of the restaurant was that huge face, the Coon Chicken Inn and you entered through the doors.  The two open doors to, to come into the--was the mouth of this big huge coon face, Coon Chicken Inn.  So that's what, what the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and, and these types of, of, of, of advocacy groups came forward and said no longer will this happen.
Story_ID: 505690
Speaker 1: So, did you--do you feel as if there or can you tell us about a historical point in which we took control over these images?  Or would you say that we si- that we instead perhaps stopped some of the negative portrayals that were just prevalent--
Speaker 2: Well, well--
Speaker 1: --in the mid-1900s?
Speaker 2: We--well, more towards the '40s [1940s], the '30s [1930s], '40s [1940s], and '50s [1950s] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so a little bit earlier.
Speaker 2: --is where we came to a--to a clamp down, where we got strong as a group and we realized that the--such people as Dr. Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] taught us that, boycott the product, okay.  Get together as a group and bring pressure to bear on that product company.  There's a toothpaste called Darkie toothpaste which portrays on, on the product a, a black Stepin Fetchit looking kind of character with big teeth grinning--big, grinning smile, red lips, you know.  Coon Chicken Inn was the same thing.  Them--the, the--so many--Sambo, Sambo the chimney sweep.  There was a product, Gold Dust washing powder.  The two black babies are on the cover and the--and the slogan was let gold dust which is the, the powder, wash anything that's black and dirty, white and clean, okay.  These kinds of things, the NAAP--the, the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] got behind, okay, and they brought pressure on those product companies and said, no, change your label now.  So the transition was a product such as--and I have both of them here.  The early product, Nigger Hair Tobacco [sic. Nigger Hair Smoking Tobacco], okay, from the turn of the century 'til the '40s [1940s], Nigger Hair Tobacco and then suddenly they changed their name on the same product box, but now it was called Bigger Hair [Bigger Hair Smoking Tobacco].
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Bigger Hair?
Speaker 2: Bigger Hair Tobacco.
Speaker 1: Bigger Hair.
Speaker 2: Same image.
Speaker 1: Did it still have a black--okay, same image.
Speaker 2: Same image--
Speaker 1: And what about--
Speaker 2: --of the African with the--with the big afro, but they did change the name.
Speaker 1: The name.
Speaker 2: The, the, the Nigger--the, the Nig- Nigger Head Tomatoes changed the name.  Now, it's called Negro Head [Negro Head Tomatoes].  Now, do you feel better?  It's Negro Head now, not Nigger Head.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.  The Darkie toothpaste was changed to Darlie toothpaste, okay.  So these changes did take place and they took place as a result of us taking control of our image and deciding that this is not acceptable anymore.  We will not tolerate these negative depictions.
Story_ID: 505701
Speaker 1: So I just wanted to ask you a follow up question about the, the Wellamont?  The Weller company [Weller Pottery]--
Speaker 2: Weller.
Speaker 1: --cookie jars.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You said that they were doing--they were attempting to get a contract with Kellogg [Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company; Kellogg Company]?
Speaker 2: Aunt Jemima.
Speaker 1: With Aunt Jemima and so they created these cookie jars, six to a set that they handed out to--
Speaker 2: Oh, that's--okay, that's--that was a misunderstanding.  The, the Weller company was trying to get a contract with Aunt Jemima.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, Aunt Jemima was looking for a premium.  It--again, everyone was doing various types of promotions to promote and sell their products, so they were giving free samples out.  You could get two for the price of one.  You could get a free set of spoons with, with every purchase.  Then you'd tear off your box top, if you sent in four box tops, you would get a free, you know, scooper, et cetera.  So people were looking--so it was that point in time when salt and pepper shakers, you would get a little free duck, something would be in the box.  You'd get something for free with every purchase.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: So, that was that point in time.  So, then this--so, so product companies were approaching all of these various different entities to try to get these contracts.  You know, people who did ceramics and little gift items and stuff were trying to get contracts, okay.  So, Weller, which is a ceramic company was trying to get a, a promotion, grab one of those promotions.  Now, what they created was a set of six different pieces.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So the set consisted of the cookie jar which was the main piece and then there was a cookie jar, there was a teapot, there was a batter bowl to mix up your pancake mix, there was a syrup pourer, and there was a sugar--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --jar.  So, so cream and sugar, okay, syrup, the batter--not--syrup, the batter bowl, and the cookie jar, okay.  So that was your s- (background noise)--see, the set that was given to the executives and then people were--you know, you could determine--I mean, it was a--it was a--you know, they didn't know which way it would go, and so that's, that's what was happening.
Story_ID: 505702
Speaker 1: You were talking about what propelled you into the collection and we've now talked a little bit about some of the images.  Could you tell us a little bit about some more of your items and in particular, can you talk about some of the items that you have for black hair that are not just (laughter) named Nigger Hair [Nigger Hair Smoking Tobacco], but in fact are for hair care or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, well the most important, of course, in terms of hair care, of course, is from--that from Madam C.J. Walker, okay, who was the first self-made millionaire in America, okay.  What she did was--well, now she started out as a result of her own problems with her hair.  She had a condition I think called alopecia [alopecia areata] where hair was falling out and she was trying to discover a remedy for her own problems.  And so in the process of doing that, and she did, but then she started helping out other--I mean, because she failed and she tried something else and it failed and it failed and it failed, so in the process of doing that, she discovered various different treatments, okay, which didn't work for her but then they were the solution for someone else's hair problem and someone else and someone else.  So this, again, she's coming up in the '20s [1920s] at a point in time where black women didn't consider themselves as pretty, as beautiful, as sexy.  Black women would never, never attempt that notion.  Black women were to work.  Just put a rag on your head and go on to work, girl.  So, it was never an assumption that you wanted to groom yourself and you could take your--please, people had to work, okay.  And when you get to that house where, where--put that scarf on your head, nobody's looking at you.  Get on your knees and get that floor clean and get back home and take care of your family.  That was it.  So, very often women just didn't really groom themselves as such and there were no products.  Where were you gonna go and get, what, Afro Sheen?  Where'd you think?  There was no products for you.  Products were not sold or produced with you as the end consumer.  Are you crazy?  So, she was the one who suddenly realized, A, she created a product line, but here's the point.  This is an opportunity for you to suddenly come out of that kitchen, to suddenly no longer be a washer woman, for you to start your own business and become an entrepreneur.  She created the product, okay, and she distributed to the average person.  She created classes in the community to teach you how to groom hair, how to treat hair and, therefore, all you needed was a chair and a sink and you could be your own business person.  And you, therefore, could have--and I have it here, a shingle that said, you know, now you are a, a, a learned--you know, a graduate of the Madam Walker School of Beauty [Madam C.J. Walker School of Beauty Culture], and you would have your kit.  And your kit consisted of your pressing comb which has on it, Madam C.J. Walker School of Beauty, you would have your products which were Madam C.J. Walker products, approved products which were manufactured and, therefore, with the training that you had, you no longer had to go there to work.  You now were able to make your own way, okay.  And that freed thousands of women, thousands of women, and suddenly they were on their own feet right there in their homes, right there in their communities.  They started to develop their own clientele, their own following, and for those who, of course, were skillful and, and more--and, and many people went beyond that because they--in addition to having the creativity and the skill, the drive, okay, to be self-sufficient and entrepreneurs, many people as well had business minds and they opened up salons and beauty shops, okay, in the community because the consumer was sitting right in front of you, okay, and so that freed many people.  Now, in addition to Madam Walker, Josephine Baker even produced a, a pomade that she herself--and I have it here.  I, I could show it to you called Bakerfix.  And because you--typically, you see Josephine Baker and she had her hair always slicked down like that, so that pomade that she wore on her hair and, of course, you know she was in Europe, but she wore--and everybody--people were trying to emulate her.  People were trying to mimic that look, okay.  How was she able to maintain it?  What did you think she used, lard?  No.  It was Bakerfix, you see, and she produced that product herself.  Joe Louis also produced a hair pomade (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Pomade.
Speaker 2: Yeah, which I also have.  So in terms of, of, of beauty products and hair care and makeup for us, there were many African Americans who were ambitious, industrious, and created these products for us--
Story_ID: 505703
Speaker 1: And, again, speaking of it, telling the story is great.  Having the actual, actual items to show, to show you, you know what I'm saying, the tangible thing to show you is also great.  And so that's what's good about collectors (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And what's so important about seeing the tangible item?  I interrupted you so you should repeat saying the importance about collectors but, you know, what is the big deal between hearing about Josephine Baker having a pomade [Bakerfix] and actually getting an opportunity to see and perhaps hold a container or a hot comb with Madam C.J. Walker on it?
Speaker 1: Because the old saying is, seeing is believing, seeing is believing.  And I think that as, as our world grow- goes on and evolves, I, I, I think to some extent, we, we, we move farther and farther away from that.  Now, I'm not sure if it was Marcus Garvey or who that, that said it, those who don't know their history are doomed to repeat it.  And so that's what I find in many cases today, that we're repeating our history.
Speaker 2: Are there places for people to go and come into contact with black Americana?  You know, so speak on the lack of ability to actually see the items but also tell us where can we see black Americana?
Speaker 1: Well, on occasion--the Schomburg [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We got the--and the up and coming possibility where you were telling me about the Magic Johnson setup, but please tell us about the Schomburg.
Speaker 1: Right.  Well, well, well, by and large, Schomburg is, is one of the largest repositories of, of literature on African Americans and quite often they have exhibits of tangibles.  They'll do exhibits on slavery and they'll have actual slave shackles and mangles of sorts, branding irons and all of that stuff, you know, slave tags, you know, such things as that for you to see as well as read and understand what these things are, what time, point in time these are from, okay, not for you to be angry, not for you to go out and, and, and attack anyone because you--that's not it.  Know your history.  Know your history.  Know your background.  Know where you came from, okay.  You, you, you just can't go forward if you don't know where you come from, you, you know what I'm saying?  We, we don't know that.  We've lost our base.
Story_ID: 505704
Speaker 1: A lot of this, this interest in our history suddenly was, was kindled from the movie, 'Roots,' when 'Roots' was, was popular.  A lot of people started realizing their genealogy, their, their own personal family tree, their family history and people started to investigate.  And then that spawned a lot of the interest in collecting our history, holding on.  In particular in my family, my grandmother, okay, they, they--from her time period which is mid-1800s to 19--
Speaker 2: What's her name and where is she from?
Speaker 1: My [maternal] grandmother, Amy Shepherd [Amy Moody Shepherd (ph.)], and she's--you know, she's passed now, but she was from, well, Louisiana, from--she was at--for most of her adult life after she was married, she was living in Shreveport, Louisiana.  But in her early--I mean, in fact at the time that she was born, family records were just kept in the family Bible, births that took place.  So, therefore, if the house ever burned or flooded or whatever, if the family Bible got lost, many people had no clue as to their actual birthdates, okay, or their actual ages, and she was one of those such people.  There was a point in time when--you know, because, you know, hey, everybody got up every day, went to work in the fields, went to work in someone's home or whatever and, you know, it just wasn't really that important.  You know, what is your actual, actual birthdate or whatever?  It didn't really--they didn't keep up with it but it was always there in the family Bible if you needed to know.  One day you may scratch your head and say, how old am I?  Oh my goodness, you know, and you could go and check the family Bible.  But if anything happened to that family Bible, there were no birth certificates.  Everyone was, was born with a midwife, you know.  So, therefore, our family Bible got destroyed at one point down in, in, in Louisiana.  There was a fire, the house burned down, gone.  So how would you know?  And so these kinds of records and documents within the--our families--a really, really unfortunate story a friend told me.  A lady--there was a gentleman, okay, who was collecting postage stamps, old postage stamps, and he was going around in the black community from house to house, knocking on doors saying, "You got any old coins?  Got any old stamps you wanna get rid of?  I'm paying cash money."  And people were going, let's see, let's see.  And a lady--this is right here in Harlem [New York, New York].  A lady had in her attic a box of old letters and they belonged to her uncle or somebody and they were up there, been up there for years and they were previously the property of her uncle who had passed away and what were they ever gonna do with those old letters that were in that box?  And it occurred to her when that gentleman knocked on the door and said, you got any old letters with old stamps on them or anything?  And that came to her mind at that point, that box of letters were correspondences between her old, deceased uncle and Harriet Tubman, and she sold that box of old letters at that point for the purpose of him obtaining the old stamps that were on the letters for little or nothing, twenty bucks [dollars].  So when he got home and realized what the letters were before he discarded them, then the stamps--the stamps became secondary because holy God--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --she didn't realize who this was.  She never took the time to look or perhaps she did and was just not aware.  And he sold those letters for a fortune.  So we don't know our history and we don't know the significance of a lot of things that are within our families, okay.
Speaker 2: You don't know where it is.
Speaker 1: And, and, therefore, also a lot of our history has been lost.  I mean, look, we were brought over on slave ships, we were dispersed, and we were sold off to different plantations and slave owners or whatever, and then as they--those families had families, they were dispersed and sold and dispersed and dispersed.  So typically when we're trying to tell our stories, a lot of times our stories can only go so far.  We, we, we don't have further knowledge because a lot of the knowledge of our families, our genealogy, is lost as far as certain generations know.  The rest of that information is in old family Bibles, within the Masonic order, old school records, et cetera, okay, letters and correspondence.  That's where a lot of our history is to be found and, of course, oral testimonies, stories, okay, sharing of these stories, and that's lost.  And we need to know the value of that.  If any of that is obtainable, we need to know that's not junk.  Don't let that family Bible go.  Don't let--don't throw out grandma's old letters, old photographs, old family pictures or what.  Don't throw them out.  That's important documentation, okay, maybe not for you, but for the generation to come.  Your daughter, your grandchildren to come are gonna one day wanna see that picture because my great-grandfather was--owned one of the Negro League teams, owned a Negro League team.  I am so blessed that my mother [Cleo Williams Davis] held on to that picture.
Story_ID: 505705
Speaker 1: What would you say is the most exciting or most meaningful thing, item that you have--you know, collectible that you have come upon or found over the--
Speaker 2: Okay, your--as a collector--
Speaker 1: I mean, clearly, you have--the--you may not be able to make a choice.
Speaker 2: As a collector (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How about three (laughter)?  What are your--
Speaker 2: As a collector, I'm, I'm gonna give you two answers.  As a collector, each item that you--they're your children.  They're your family.  And so obviously how could you turn to any one of your family members and say you're my favorite, you can't.  That's number one.  Now, let's go to another level.  Collecting somehow becomes spiritual also and, I mean, maybe I'll spook myself, maybe this is voodoo, but a lot of times I come into my home and I glance around and all of these eyes looking at me, all of these spirits, all of these souls staring at me.  And sometimes I've gotten the idea or listen to friends, "Oh, you got too much, all this stuff, oh my God, you got too much.  Weed out your collection.  Get rid of some of these things, some of them--oh my God."  And I'll agree with them and say, "Yeah, it is overwhelming, it is a bit too much."  And I'll put my hand out and maybe in my demented mind, I'll just get the feeling that this will go, no, no, no, not me, not me, not me.  So then I'll say, okay, well maybe this.  No, not me, not me.  No, not that one either.  And I just can't make a decision.  Every one of them seems to like recoil or pull away from me, not me, not me, her, not me.  And so I can't decide which one or if I--likewise, if I turn around and go that's my, my most--because I remember each story.  I remember going to the flea market.  I remember going to Atlantic City [New Jersey].  I remember each opportunity, each missed opportunity maybe.  I remember the time when I wanted a certain item and, and how many times I missed getting it and ultimately I got it, how many times I had to sacrifice months at a time.  Sometimes I couldn't even pay my rent.  I was really on the edge because I spent three hundred dollars on a cookie jar.  I spent my, my food money, my clothing money, all of my discretionary funds, I spent it, some of my bill money on, on some of these items because I had to have it.  I had to have it.  And so each piece as I look at it, I remember one of--some story, the way in which I got it.  And so, therefore, then to just take it lightly, to give it up or to say--I mean, because that was my favorite at that time, then I went on down my list and I, I was seeking after the next piece.
Story_ID: 505706
Speaker 1: And what I've done is collected categorically.  I, I mean, I learned from experienced collectors and I learned to sort of collect categorically.  And there's, there's hair products, there's food products, there's ceramics, there's cookie jars.  I have a collection of cereal boxes, okay, blacks on cereal boxes.  And typically, again, it wasn't that often that blacks were on products.  Blacks weren't featured on products because it was considered a negative, you see, that, that maybe you won't sell your product if, if it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Is it a negative?  Ah.
Speaker 1: Maybe you won't sell your product if someone black--the magazine industry, okay.  How--when was it that they finally--that Vogue finally put someone on the cover, a black face on the cover of Vogue.  When was it?
Speaker 2: When was it when someone--
Speaker 1: Beverly Johnson.
Speaker 2: When a black face--
Speaker 1: Beverly Johnson.  Beverly Johnson was the first African American to be on the cover of Vogue.  I'll have to look back at my Vogue now to see the--
Speaker 2: Circa.
Speaker 1: I think it was in the '80s [1980s], you know.  I think it was in, in, in, in the--in the '80s [1980s].  I'll have to--I'll have to, to check and--I'll have to look at my--look back and see.  I'm just saying, but the, the, the point being that there was a point in time, you know, and, and for so--for so long that if you--you know, as you would advertise your product and promote your product, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You would not--
Speaker 1: --make a choice.
Speaker 2: --want to have a black person on--
Speaker 1: Would you--do you want--especially for fashion, okay.  And, and, and for, for beauty care products, okay, for a Revlon [Revlon, Inc.] product for--say for a shampoo.  You know, just the notion that if you have a black girl floating along there, you know, with luxurious, beautiful hair, but then the white consumer has to assume, well, fine, that's for her hair.  I don't have the same type of hair, so then this product is not for me, okay.  If you have someone black on the cover of a magazine, then, you know, your product is, is still--you know, you have, you know, to wonder how is the white consumer going to, you know, react to, to, to seeing a black face on a white product.
Speaker 2: So we have a shift sort--we have a--we have our two categories anyway.  We have products which are designed to create trust, you know, at the turn of the century like your Aunt Jemima, your Cream of Wheat, and then we now have products that we wanna sell to black people in particular, perhaps we would put black faces on them, but otherwise, we would need to choose a white face or a face that was not--
Speaker 1: By and large, I'd say, again in terms of advertising, the end user, the consumer, the assumed consumer, is the white customer, okay.  It's just more recently that it's been safe, okay, because, again, what had happened, what began happening was, okay, as we would have the Aunt Jemimas, which at the beginning was, the notion was trust.  We're using a black on a product, okay, because that in- engendered trust, okay, in the product.  What wasn't expected was, you've also created an unintended celebrity.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Because if you choose an individual, okay, and photograph them and put them on, you know what I'm saying?  So Hattie McDaniel, was she intended at the beginning to win an Academy Award [Oscar]?  Or did they just need a black maid in 'Gone with the Wind'?  You see what I'm saying?  So that was kind of an unintentional result that happened as a result of using blacks on certain products or in certain movies or, or to display blacks, portray blacks here and there, not realizing sometimes, you created a celebrity, a Stepin Fetchit, you know.  Was that in--was that what you thought would happen?  You didn't realize that, did you?  You see?  So that was--that was also a, a--an aspect of what, what came as a result of putting blacks on products.
Story_ID: 505707
Speaker 1: So, Aunt Jemima is still on the Aunt Jemima pancake box.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you talk a little bit about the development and changes that have occurred with Aunt Jemima (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, with, with our changing times--
Speaker 1: And then a little bit later, we're gonna look at some of your original, original pictures of Aunt Jemima and her first--a woman named, Nancy, you said?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Nancy Green.
Speaker 1: With her--the first--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --Aunt Jemima.
Speaker 2: She was the first person to portray the Aunt Jemima character--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And so has--
Speaker 2: --okay, at the turn of the century.
Speaker 1: --the character remained the same or has it changed over the years?
Speaker 2: Yeah, then over the years I think they started in the '60s [1960s] to change the image of Aunt Jemima, to try to update her and make her a little bit more contemporary as--again, as times changed, as advocacy groups demanded that we not be seen in neg- in a negative way, and therefore brought pressure to bear on product companies, that we would boycott their products if they continued to show us in what was considered a negative light.  We took back control of our image, so as we dictated what our image would be and how we'd be portrayed, we announced to them, this is acceptable, that's not.  And so they, therefore, turned around after having--after we made examples of a few people, they therefore turned around many product companies who--that beared the image of blacks on their products, either drop the image completely or they changed the image to something a bit more contemporary and more palatable, so Aunt Jemima in particular changed--now, they went through a transition with the bandana, the full bandana turned to a little bit of a scarf, and then the scarf went off completely and then now she has a lovely quaffed hairdo with pearl earrings and a lovely smiling face and, you know, she looks very contemporary and, and now.  So, so, so product companies have, you know, arrived, you know, to that understanding that we will not tolerate negative black images on products.
Story_ID: 505708
Speaker 1: Give us a list of the people who you have on cereal boxes.
Speaker 2: Oh, boy.
Speaker 1: 'Cause they are--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well Wheaties--
Speaker 1: --very interesting (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Again, the first--I have to look at the date again, Roy Campanella was the first and this was just a pencil drawing, was the first athlete that was ever--and this--and not on the cover.
Speaker 1: And what type of athlete is Roy Campanella?
Speaker 2: Baseball.
Speaker 1: And what--so what year, circa, is, is he on the box?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy.
Speaker 1: Give us a idea.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I, I don't--I don't even wanna--I don't wanna say it incorrectly 'cause I can--I have it here and I could--I could pull it out and be correct--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --with having--with, with saying it.  But my point is that, again, product, they're products and, and so it's just so scary.  It was so--it was--it was dangerous to, to, to put a black--I mean, you have to realize, when--now, what year was it that Nat King Cole had a--he was among the very first to ever have a show on television, Nat King Cole, and Rheingold was one of his sponsors, Rheingold Beer.  And in the South, the southerners, okay, the racist southerners really came against Rheingold and they boycotted and they told them that they would just--they would shut them down.  They would--they would boycott their product if they continued to support and, and back Nat King Cole on that TV show, and the TV show went off the air, you see.  And so that kind of, of, of--again, that fear that, you know, if you put blacks on your product, okay, product companies were fearful that, you know, they're gonna face reprisal if they, you know--it was--it was dangerous.  So, again, we had to move along in time whereby we, we as the consumer, we the blacks realized that these products were not being advertised to us.  There was no fear that we were not going to use the product or, or boycott, you know, the product or whatever, but then again, the advocacy groups and Dr. Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and such black leaders came forward and told us, wait, you have the power, okay.  You have the power to dictate--
Speaker 1: Who's on the box (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) If you got together as a group, okay.  You can rearrange this thinking and make product companies realize, you have to advertise to us as well, not every day, but I do occasionally expect to see my image on a product.
Speaker 1: So who, who else is on the cereal?
Speaker 2: So, so sports figures, famous sports figures.  I have people from entertainment as well, Michael Jackson and The Jackson 5.  I have a cereal box with Vanessa Williams.  Kellogg's [Kellogg Company] did a promotion.  And what's interesting about it is, I think 1984 when Vanessa Williams--
Speaker 1: Won (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The first black--
Speaker 1: --Miss America.
Speaker 2: --African American to win Miss America, how wonderful was that?  Okay, and the--and they--and they--here it is.  I have the, the picture in case if you--if you wanna even look at it.  And how wonderful was that, that, that they wanted to feature her on the box.  Now, the box that you have there, it says up in the corner of the front of the box, not for sale.  It's a commemorative box because those were given out one night at a function that the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] was having, okay.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: So this was just the first promotion.  This box never reached the shelf.  Why?  Because a scandal broke out and so, therefore, they wanted to disassociate themselves, completely disassociate themselves from Vanessa Williams at that point because there was a bit of a scandal, okay.  So the actual box never reached the shelf.  Again, therefore, it's a collector's item and I got one, luckily.  But that, again, said to everyone, you know, oh my gosh, oh my gosh (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Can we put black people on the--
Speaker 2: Put a black people--person on--
Speaker 1: --cover?
Speaker 2: --on your product.  What are you gonna get?  What's gonna happen?
Story_ID: 505717
Speaker 1: So, now we're getting an opportunity to see some of the items that you've been telling us about.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What do you have here?
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, we earlier spoke about the Coon Chicken Inn restaurant items and also tobacco items.  Here, we have the early can which as you can see, it says Nigger Hair, Nigger Hair Tobacco [Nigger Hair Smoking Tobacco], okay.  So this was from the turn of the century, the Nigger Hair original can, okay.  And then with pressure brought to bear as I told you from advocacy groups, what they did was, they changed the name from Nigger Hair to Bigger Hair Tobacco [Bigger Hair Smoking Tobacco] in the '40s [1940s], okay.  So that's one of the products, evidence, tangible evidence of the fact, you know, that this change took place, that we were able to affect this type of change, okay, on products that had--people don't believe that there was a point in time when Whitman's, Whitman's chocolate [Whitman's Candies], okay, had a product called Pickaninny Peppermints.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Can you believe, Whitman's?  Okay, and then on that product, they had pictures of little babies eating watermelon, okay, and looking like kind of Stepin Fetchit types of characters, okay, Whitman's chocolate, okay.  And that--and that was the name of, of the--of the product.  And, and inside the box, you would slide it open like this and, and the chocolates would be inside of the box, okay.  So, again, people don't realize that, that these products existed because pressure was brought to bear on product companies and it was no longer acceptable.
Speaker 1: I just wanna point out.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: I just wanted to point out that this yellow Nigger Hair Tobacco can is from--is dated 1878 there on the front.
Story_ID: 505718
Speaker 1: What are we taking a look at here?
Speaker 2: This is something else that, that we had described earlier, which is the earlier can, which is Nigger Head Tomatoes, Nigger Head brand tomatoes, okay.  And the company from Baltimore [Maryland].  I don't know if you can see it there.  Oh, boy I'm destroying the display, Baltimore, Maryland, okay.  And then, now, the--this, this--the earlier company was located in Baltimore, okay, and then they later moved to Biloxi, Mississippi, Nigger Head.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: And so now, ultimately what happened was, the Nigger Head, okay, tomato company which also had oysters and seafood products ultimately had to change their name to Negro Head, Negro Head.
Speaker 1: Can you just shift it slightly so we can see the, the more contemporary young man--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --(laughter) who's advertising?
Speaker 2: So, therefore, we changed the name, they changed the name let's say.  They changed the name and the image.  And, of course, they're no longer in, in business, but I'm--again, it's another example of the way which pressure was brought to bear on product companies to--and, and, and we demanded, as African Americans, we demanded that we will no longer tolerate these types of negative images and portrayals of us.
Speaker 1: And I'm assuming that the Nigger Head company must have had some nice big signs outside that said Nigger Head Tomatoes or--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Story_ID: 505719
Speaker 1: So I was just saying that the Nigger Head company must have had some signs outside and you pulled out this every day newspaper.
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What does it depict?
Speaker 2: This is a newspaper, advertisement, and actual, actual piece from the Appleton Daily Post, Tuesday, October the 7th, 1917.  Okay, and what it is, is they were advertising Nigger Hair Smoking Tobacco, as you can see, and also with, with purchasing the Nigger Hair Tobacco, you would also get your S&H Green trading stamps [Sperry and Hutchinson Company].  If you collected--you know, at that point in time, you--people were collecting the trading stamps because then with, with so many stamps, you were able to get these various valuable items if you collected, you know, so many stamps.  They were trading stamps.
Speaker 1: Which included a container of the smoking tobacco itself.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  And with, with a purchase of--so, it wasn't as if this was a, a hidden item that someone was ashamed and say, oh my gosh, Nigger Head Tobacco.  It was a common item that was on the shelf at your local grocery store.
Speaker 1: And was the word nigger used often?  I mean--
Speaker 2: In the South, it was--it was whatever it is (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Standard.
Speaker 2: It is what it is.  I mean, look at the product.  Isn't that a nigger?  So, you know, Nigger Hair.  And, again, look--the loose hair.  I mean, it sort of mimicked the loose tobacco and so I think the image was to sort of depict, you know, Nigger Hair, loose tobacco, hm.  So, there it is.  But I, I wanted to show you this to help illustrate the fact that these were common every day products, okay, not a rarity (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: Not something that was unique.
Story_ID: 505720
Speaker 1: Tell us about these piggybanks.
Speaker 2: Okay, now these banks, they're--and, and, and, and you, you put it so nicely.
Speaker 1: Where do you put the money?
Speaker 2: Well, it's an apparatus on the back and it's a lever, and you would actually place your coin in the hand, okay, and then you push the lever on the back and the eyes roll back and the money drops inside the mouth, so he's actually eating the money as it were, okay.  And these banks come in different variety.  The, the initial first bank, you know, which is the man and then they made a second bank, which is Dinah [Aunt Dinah] which was only made in Europe, not in America.  They're made of cast iron and they're very heavy, these banks.  The rarest of the banks is the high hat bank that's with the hat.  I mean, that's one of the rarest and hardest to find.  I want you to just take notice to the actual name and I'm gonna turn this one around so you can see the name of the bank.  And I, I hope that you're able to see that, okay.  Jolly Nigger bank, okay.  So that's the name.  I don't know if you saw the movie, Spike Lee's movie, 'Bamboozled'?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: But, this bank was featured in the movie, okay.  And, again, they are extremely rare items, if you can get them in good condition, of, of course, and they have the generations of them.  Later--I mean, these are--these are turn of the century and then in later years, they made them out of pot metal after World War II [WWII] when, when metal was not accessible and they were very lightweight, you know, pot metal.  And then they had another generation of these banks called the Greedy Nigger Bank [ph.], Greedy Nigger, okay, again because he--you push the lever and he--they eat, eat the money, you know, so to speak, you know.  You push the lever and the money drops--the, the eyes roll back and the money drops down into, into their--into, into the mouth.
Story_ID: 505721
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about these hair products.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, we earlier spoke (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or hair and makeup, actually.
Speaker 2: Well, we earlier spoke about Madam C.J. Walker and what, what I'm showing you here is your kit.  Upon graduating, upon attending the school that--Madam C.J. Walker's school for beauty culture and hair care [Madam C.J. Walker School of Beauty Culture], okay, then therefore the graduating student would receive your kit.  So, this, this kit and, and, and the, the whole case would consist of your beauty products, okay--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: So, what we have here is the kit.  Now, a, a student would attend the Madam C.J. Walker School of Beauty Care and Culture, hair care, and upon graduating, you would receive your kit.  This kit would indicate that you graduated and what year.  It would also supply you with your first products that you would use with your customers.  Some are skincare products for skin brightening which was very important and then you had your hair care products for hair growing, for hair treatment if you had problems with your hair, for pressing the hair, and, and, and the most collectible, of course, is that one with the image.  Some people think that's the image of Madam Walker, but that's actually Mae Bundles [sic. Fairy Mae Bryant; Mae Walker], whom they adopted, okay, and her daughter, A'Lelia [A'Lelia Walker], adopted her, and because she had long, beautiful hair, and so they kind of used her as their poster child to most of their--the products, the Madam Walker products.  And so she, therefore, now is kind of a, a descendent of Madam Walker because she was adopted, but Madam Walker, in fact, only had a daughter, A'Lelia Bundles [sic. A'Lelia Walker], and this is Mae, so that's kind of a little known fact.  But in any event, you would get your pressing comb, which of course was most important in your kit, and a kit would also indicate your credentials.  So, in this particular case, you'll see that this kit was--had been received by Addie Lee, September the 14th, 1934.  She was the graduate.  And so this is typical of everyone that would go to the school, which was located in Indianapolis, Indiana, and attend.  And, and I think a, a photograph is there of the actual school in Indianapolis along with your photograph of--see how beautiful?  This whole structure that Madam Walker erected and there--and that housed the beauty school as well as her product line.  And then here's a bit of a, a photograph of, of, of Madam Walker, herself, you see, so there's her actual image.  And then--and I think inside of the, the booklet you receive, your, your, your book that you were--that you used during the time that you were in school, your textbook is there.  And also, there's a paper, a large sort of newspaper that was there which would feature a lot of different hairstyles of the day that--so, therefore, you could put that up in your salon or in your kitchen or in your basement, wherever you were doing hair and where you would receive your, your, your customers.  And then also, there was a, a yearbook that each student would receive at the end of their graduation, which would feature pictures of your fellow students and colleagues that you attended classes with throughout that particular year as well as a shingle that would show that you were an authorized agent.  I think we'll pull that out in a minute, to show that you were an authorized agent, having attended and graduated from the Madam C.J. Walker school of preparations.  So, this is something that--most rare and significant and tangible evidence, once again, something that actually existed along with the story.  Here's the actual tangible evidence of it.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so there it is now, the, the shingle which I mentioned to you.  So that you would hang up and, and it, it authenticates you.  It shows that you have in fact graduated.  You're an authorized dealer of, of Madam C.J. Walker system and preparations and, therefore, you're qualified to treat and groom black hair.
Story_ID: 505722
Speaker 1: So here we go.  Now, here's--what you're looking at is a photograph of the actual restaurant which is the Coon Chicken Inn.  The Coon Chicken Inn existed during the '30s [1930s] and '40s [1940s].  They just sort of petered out in the '50s [1950s].  They had three locations, Seattle, Washington, Portland, Oregon, and Salt Lake City, Utah, okay.  The Coon Chicken Inn was a--the, the restaurant, as you can see featured this huge facade of a big coon face.  And you see the door there?  You walk through the, the, the door which is at the mouth of the big coon face.  That was the actual entrance into the restaurant through the--through, through the, the, the doors there and they had--as well as the restaurant, everything in the restaurant, all of the dishes, the, the, the plates, the spoons, the forks, the, the napkin holders, everything featured this coon face that they--on all of their--which is their logo, Coon Chicken Inn.  Can you believe it?  That's a straw--that's a straw holder, okay, as you can see for the Coon Chicken Inn.  And this was for toothpicks, to hold toothpicks and perhaps even matches, okay, Coon Chicken Inn.  And typically as you could see there and perhaps you'll see it on the--on the menu, the name Coon Chicken Inn was, was--the letters were on the teeth.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, and, so now, here where you're looking at the menu.  This is an actual menu from the Coon Chicken Inn restaurant.  And as I mentioned, the--on the teeth, see the teeth, the big smiling, big red lips, and there it is, Coon Chicken Inn, okay, with the little monkey hat, very clever, a pack of cigarettes is next to that with the matches.  That's also one of the features that the restaurant had to offer, that you could put the sleeve on a pack of cigarettes that you'd be smoking also to just remember that you were there at one point at the Coon Chicken Inn, all of these artifacts they created to advertise their, their restaurant.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: So there--so now what I'm showing you is the inside of the menu.  And on the, I guess, left side of the menu, you would see--they were showing you all of their various locations on the West Coast there and the Coon Chicken restaurants and where you can--where they can be found.  And on the other side of the menu, as you can see, someone has held onto this at the time.  Perhaps it was a memorable experience.  They may have gone there on their honeymoon, for the night after the, the school prom or something, who knows.  But, these are souvenirs, these menus as, as it turns out.  And you can see here the date.  Someone actually captured the date at the time that they had gotten it, the summer of 1947, okay.  Now, inside the menu, I want you to see this because you can see what they served and what the prices were at the time.  You could get the Coon Chicken special, a dollar and a quarter, okay.  And baby corn, liver plate, boy, Mexican style chili forty cent.  Sandwiches were there.  They have a pr- pretty full menu.  And it's interesting that the Coon Chicken Inn, that, that they survived for such a, a long time.  And they didn't serve to blacks, so this was a restaurant despite the, the logo and all that was there, it was still not a place that was welcoming to blacks to come and sit at the counters or at their tables.
Speaker 2: Now, as you can see here, there's the plate.  And I have the full set because there's full place settings actually of the dishes that were also a part of the, the restaurant, at the Coon Chicken Inn restaurant.  They had three different patterns of the plates as well as--because each location had its own set of dishes and so there were--you would--you could get this which is your full dinner plate.  There was a salad plate.  There's a cereal bowl, soup bowl, then the cup, saucer, spoons, forks, et cetera.  The flatware was there.  So there was a full range of salt and peppers, everything.  And what's interesting is, the coffee cup that featured the, the, the Coon Chicken Inn logo inside the cup.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Inside of the cup as you can see there, so they were very clever in terms of, of featuring this Coon Chicken logo everywhere.  And as always, the Coon Chicken Inn lettering was on the teeth of, of, of their--of the image there.
Story_ID: 505723
Speaker 1: As we mentioned, this is the Weller [Weller Pottery] set.  There are six pieces in the set.  And starting from the left, we have the creamer, okay, with the little boy holding on.  But that was also the handle of the creamer.  Behind it is the tea pitcher, teapot, okay, with the mammy.  The sugar bowl is behind her, okay, with the two twins there and the top--the lid comes off.  It's a sugar, sugar dish, a sugar bowl.  And then, of course, the main piece, the, the, the real, real most important feature is the large cookie jar, and that's, you know, the, the head is the lid of the jar there, the huge big mammy with the big juicy lips, okay, the Weller cookie jar.  And then after that is the syrup pitcher, okay, mammy there, okay, and you can see the spout in front of her, so that's a syrup pitcher.  And then the largest piece in the bunch is the batter bowl for mixing up the batter for your pancakes.  So this is the, the, the complete Weller set which I mentioned.  Only 144 pieces were made and this cookie jar set was given to all of the executives at the Aunt Jemima company at one point as they were trying to compete for a contract for a premium.
Speaker 2: And what we have here is the complete Weller set.  The--it's--I, I would say the Weller cookie jar set.  Starting from the left, what you have is the creamer, okay, with the little boy holding onto the cup, which is also the handle of the cup.  Okay, so that--that's the creamer.  Behind that is the teapot with the mammy you see there and the spout is in the front, so that's the large teapot.  The head is the lid of the teapot.  Next to the teapot is the sugar bowl with the two twins which, again, are the handles, and the watermelon which is there, ha, ha, ha, is the lid for the top which comes off this sugar bowl.  The main feature of this whole set, of course, is the huge big mammy.  She's holding a watermelon, ha, ha, and she has the big fat juicy lips.  Her head is the lid of the cookie jar.  And that's in mint condition as you can see, the Weller cookie jar.  That cookie jar itself is well over two thousand dollars, just the cookie jar.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): She's holding--?
Speaker 2: A watermelon there, you can see (laughter).  It's crazy.  Below the cookie jar is the syrup pitcher, okay, because again, you realize this set was intended for people who make pancakes, syrup pitcher.  And there's the mammy, you see the spout in front of her there, okay.  So that's a syrup pitcher.  And then the largest piece in the group is the batter bowl.  And, of course, the batter bowl, you see a spout on the front of the batter bowl there and so that, again, was for mixing the batter for your pancakes.  So there you have the whole--all of the six pieces, the whole set, the Weller cookie jar set.

Speaker 1: Here's an example of what we discussed about Aunt Jemima now.  The first advertisement for Aunt Jemima, the--there was no actual Aunt Jemima as it were, but this lady, Nancy Green, 1900, she was the first person to actually portray the, the fictitious Aunt Jemima, okay, Nancy Green.  And so there she is and this is an actualized photograph of her.  I mean, it's not a caricature or image or drawing.  You can see that's an actual person there.  And then, of course, I told you at this point in time, premiums was something, a tool to help to sell products, so they're offering these dolls.  See, free Aunt Jemima with her ragdoll family.  You would get that, you know, with--in exchange for coupons and labels if your box--you know, with proof of purchase.  But that, this ad that was in the newspaper, okay--I mean, in a magazine, Ladies' Home Journal from turn of the century, okay, in 1900, from the 1900s.  I wanna show you there for how the Aunt Jemima image went through its sort of transitions from the early '20s [1920s].  And then you see another image of Aunt Jemima as it sort of transitioned from the--from the Nancy Green, the early image that's featured on the--on the, the boxes there on the advertisement to this image which existed during the, the, the '20s [1920s], the early '20s [1920s], the Aunt Jemima.  And, again, she's looking pretty crude there and kind of grizzly, but there she is, Aunt Jemima.  And then as the--as, as the product moved on into like the '40s [1940s], okay, you got a bit more pleasant, more jovial Aunt Jemima with, with the same kerchief on her head, but there it was a little bit more refined and a little more pleasant to look at.  But as you can you see, the products have, have now gone onto green pea soup, Aunt Jemima and, therefore, in the later '50s [1950s] again, the, the lady was a bit more refined and, again, that, that pleasant face with the scarf on her head and all.  So the pancake mix products became more instant.  The product boxes became larger.  It was more improved.  You can see they said pancake shortcake, you know.  So they were constantly evolving.  And as the product evolved and as years moved on, they kept on changing the image of Aunt Jemima as well.  And today's image of Aunt Jemima I think has a, a beautiful hairstyle with curls and she's wearing a string of pearls around her neck and she's looking totally contemporary.  But these are the earliest images of Aunt Jemima.

Speaker 1: So right now, this is my [maternal] grandmother when she was three years old.  She's on the front row and to the extreme right.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Can you tell us the name, the name of the family and everyone's name, full name if you know it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So my, my grandmother, this is my grandmother and her name is Amy, Amy Shepherd [Amy Moody Shepherd (ph.)].  Her maiden name is Moody, so actually you're looking at the Moody family.  The year for this would, would be somewhere around eight--in the late 1890s, so grandma was, let me see, so late 1890s, so--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, so let's say starting from the left with the young man there.  Do you know who that man is?
Speaker 1: Her brothers, Uncle Dan [Dan Moody], Uncle Robert [Robert Moody], Uncle Dan.  I'm not sure which one is which, Uncle Robert, Uncle Dan.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  And point to those who you do know.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  So this is--so, Uncle Robert, Uncle Dan, well, well, this is grandma, okay, at three years old.  And then--so grandma is standing here amongst--with her whole family and their on a plantation in Louisiana where the, the--her--grandma's mother named Sarah Moody [ph.] and her father, John Moody [ph.], so there the two of them are, and then this is John's mother whom they called Mommay [ph.].  And so the rest are all my uncles and aunts, I suppose, which are the brothers and sisters.  So this is the entire family, the Moody family, so here's grandma, great-grandmother, and then great-grandfather, and then great-great, two times, three times, great-grandmother there.  So that's a very valuable picture for me to have of my family from that time period.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Now, these are on whose side, your mother's side (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) My mothers, uh-huh.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Go ahead.
Speaker 1: This is my father's mother, Emma Carter Davis [Emma Davis], and this picture would've been taken, you know, like in the late '40s [1940s], and she's standing there in front of her house in Danville, Virginia.
Speaker 2: This is my grandfather, Walter Davis.  This picture is from back in the '30s [1930s] during the time that he was really dapper and he was working at the cotton mill [Dan River Mills] in Danville, Virginia, so this is Walter Davis, my grandfather.
Speaker 1: This is my grandmother, Amy Shepherd, and during the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s], she worked as a domestic--can I start again?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Yeah, yeah, go ahead.
Speaker 1: This is my grandmother, Amy Shepherd, and during the '20s [1920s], she worked as a domestic in Louisiana and Natchitoches, Louisiana.  And there she is with her maid's uniform on and holding a baby, little white baby whom she used to care for, for the family that she worked for during that time period.
Speaker 2: Now, this is grandma when she got married to the right, Reverend Floyd Shepherd [ph.], and so now her name has moved from Amy Moody to Amy Shepherd.  And you can see the beautiful wedding cake there and her wedding--typically, black people had their weddings at home, the, the recep- the, the wedding would be at the church and then they'd have a reception there at the house.  So, here we are, Amy Moody Shepherd.
Speaker 1: So, this is a photograph of my mom when she was like about nineteen and, and my grandmother which is, you know, her mother.  And she had first come--I think this was after the war [World War II, WWII] in 1945, and she had just come to Washington, D.C., and grandma came up on a weekend to visit her and they went to a portrait gallery and took this photograph together.  Okay, so this is my mother, Cleo Davis [Cleo Williams Davis], and my grandmother, Amy Shepherd.
Speaker 2: Now, this is one of my really most valuable photographs.  It's my Uncle Dan.  He lived in St. Louis, Missouri, and he played for one of the Negro League baseball teams.  And there he is with his uniform on and the, the name of the team is called Titanium Pigment [sic. Titanium Giants].  And I don't know what that means, but that's such an incredible picture to imagine that that's one of your family members.  So his name, my Uncle Dan Moody, Dan Moody, 1940s.
Speaker 1: This is a photograph of my whole family.  This is in the '70s [1970s].  My father is a Mason and also a Shriner and, you know, and my mother is in the Eastern Star [Order of the Eastern Star].  They were all--or we were all dressed up this evening going to one of their Masonic events that they were having.  And so from the left, that's me, the first person there, oh my goodness, and then my father, my mother, Jordan Davis [Jordan Davis, Sr.], Cleo Davis, and then the crazy one on the opposite side, my brother, with his mouth open, that's Phillip Davis, and between my mom and dad, of course, is Jordan, Jr. [Jordan Davis, Jr.].  So my father is Jordan, Sr., he's Jordan, Jr.  So, this is my whole crazy family, all of us when we were fabulous and young and looking beautiful.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  And I'm sorry, did you mention the year?
Speaker 1: In the--yeah, I did.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Oh, you did.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, in the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: Here's a photograph of my father holding me when I was one year old.  I don't even know who told me really one year so, of course, this is like 1953.  And, again, another picture that I will always cherish.  That's my father, Jordan Davis.  I don't know what I was thinking at that time, but anyway, there you go.
Speaker 1: And here's another fabulous black and white picture.  This is me when I was like two years old and--in our home where we--one of our first apartments that my parents got.  And my brother is in the background there with the bottle in his mouth.  We were toddlers.  And, again, this is back, you know, in the early '50s [1950s], and so I'm just showing you how my early beginnings, some of my early beginnings (laughter).
Speaker 2: This is a crazy photo for you.  I was eight years old.  My father had a friend who was a photographer. And the way he would get business on the weekends, he would go around and--with a pony and, and people could sit on the pony and take their, their pictures, their portraits.  So, so here I am sitting on the pony getting my picture taken with my cowboy hat on.  I wasn't really ready for it as you could see.  I had pants with holes in the knees, my sneakers, but there I am.
Speaker 1: And here's a portrait.  My mom took us all to a, a studio and got, got the photographs, so I'm there, nicely dressed up.  It was Easter Sunday and we all got our individual pictures and so this is mine.  I had to beg my grandmother to give me this picture, oh my gosh, but that's me.  I was five years old.
Speaker 2: This is my high school ID card from 1968, '69 [1969].  I think I was in the eleventh grade.  And see my photograph there.  This is one, one, one of my conservative years when I had the nice close cut haircut and I was looking very, very clean and very conservative, so just wanted you to see that.  That's the high school that I went to, Chamberlain Vocational School [Chamberlain Vocational High School] in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Now, after high school, I went to New York [New York] and went to the Fashion Institute, and after my years at FIT [Fashion Institute of Technology, New York, New York], upon graduating, then I moved right on out and went to Paris [France], to school [Ecole de la Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne, Paris, France] in France.  So this is a student travel card, which allows you to travel and get discounts.  The year that this picture was taken is 1973.  And you see me with my fabulous afro and looking really stupendous.  And I was so thrilled to be in Europe at that time, so you can see it all there.
Speaker 2: This picture brings back a lot of memories.  When I was in school in Paris, they sent us all out individually to pursue special projects, and I think I was supposed to do some like beach cover-ups for a swimwear collection.  And I found this shop and I was there searching desperately for something new and interesting to come back to school with to, to show my project for swimwear, couture swimwear collection.  And these were the fabrics that I was considering, so that's a--just a snapshot that I had taken at that time.  Again, this was in the '70s [1970s].
