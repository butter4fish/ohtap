 Gill. Today is September 3, 2009. I   m visiting with  Louis Blair on the Oklahoma State University campus in Stillwater,  Oklahoma. This interview is part of the Oklahoma Oral History  Research Program and the O-STATE Stories Project. And, Louis, I know  you   re on campus and taking time to come by and visit with us.  Happy to be with you, Jerry. Happy to be back on campus.  Your relation to Oklahoma State University goes back several years  through your position as executive director with the Truman Scholarship  Fund.  That   s right. I think it probably goes back to about 1991. Well, the  Truman Foundation selects its scholars by using regional panels made  up of prominent public servants. A panel had Henry Bellmon on it,  former senator and former governor, and a good friend of the chairman  of the foundation at the time. We got Henry on board and Henry  thought,    Hmm, why are we giving all this money to people from  schools other than OSU?     And he would think that way, too.  Yes. So, then George brought Bob Graalman and said,    Bob, you need  to get Louis Blair up on campus.    So, I had a job.  Maybe step back just a minute. How did you become involved with the  Truman Program?  Serendipity. I was good friends with  inaudible . I was working in the  White House and bumped into him one day, and I said,    What are you  doing?    And he said,    I   m running the Truman Scholarship Foundation.  Come help me select scholars and give away money.    So, I did it. Did  5  Gill  Blair  Gill  Blair  Gill  Blair  Gill  Blair  Gill  that for ten years. One day I got a letter from him. It said,    Louis, I   m  retiring. Would you like to have my office straight from the White  House over to the building? Would you like to travel around? Would  you like to collect money?    And I said,    Absolutely. And then, by the  way, does the job pay anything?       Pays very well.    Then, that was it.  That was the clincher, wasn   t it?  Yes.  Well, can you share some information about the Truman Scholarship  program, its history, its purpose and goals?  Sure. As you know, the federal government, I guess starting with  Roosevelt, maybe even with Hoover, tries to honor its former Presidents  with some memorial, perhaps a library or something like that. Truman  Library was built by private funds, so there was a discussion, and  Truman let it be known he   d like to have some scholarship program to  honor him. So, after his death on the 26th of December, 1972, some  people got together and said,    We need to have a scholarship program.     One of his best friends had been Stuart Symington who was a senator  from Missouri. Symington   s son was a congressman from Missouri, and  the family and the Symingtons and some others considered this idea, put  it together. It was sent to President Ford for his signature. Ford had a  bust of Truman in his Oval Office. Ford signed it with a flourish, and  that   s what set it up.  Did President Truman indicate that he would prefer something like this  as opposed to a bricks and mortar project as you indicated earlier? So,  it says a lot about his values, doesn   t it?  It certainly does. Truman never went to college. He went for one  semester. He always wished he had more education and he found it at  Harvard, and that   s pretty much his memorial.  So, what was the mission of the fund? The goals, the purpose of it? Will  you share a little bit of that for us?  Yes. In the legislation  20 U.S.C. 2001-2013 , the goals are to help  young people prepare for careers in public service. It established a trust  fund to help young people prepare for careers in public service. It did  not define public service. It left it open so it would be more than just  federal employment or state employment.  Louis, was part of the early funding for it government supported in terms  of private fundraising, or a combination?  6  Blair  Gill  Blair  Gill  Blair  Gill  Blair  Gill  Blair  It was a trust fund. It was a onetime appropriation from the government  in the amount of  30 million, and then they created in treasury a fund, a  mechanism, to administer them. They also set up a foundation and   inaudible  so that they write money  they  oversee.  Why are international and national scholarship programs like the  Truman Program, Udall, Marshall, Goldwater, Rhodes, etc., so  important, so coveted, to the recipients and respective universities?  Well, I think there are several reasons. One, if something is rare, that  becomes coveted. Certainly, if it   s a mark of distinction, extraordinary  distinction, for the student and that reflects on the university. And third,  I think, is the values that that scholarship represents. Truman Foundation  is public service, leadership, service to others.  I know it is very prestigious to the individual but also to the university.  Yes.  It sort of distinguishes them as special when they have those as an  honor.  And that   s what Oklahoma State has done ever so well in President  Halligan. He said,    Hey, let   s have a number of Truman Scholars. Let   s  recognize them.    And one thing that President Halligan did that I like so  much was in the recruiting material to get freshmen here. He highlighted  what the institute had done for Truman Scholars, other scholarships, and  says,    Hey, we have an athletics program, football, basketball, and  wrestling, but also   not just academics, but service to others.    Senator  Bellmon was the initial spark, President Halligan was the visionary and  Graalman was the action guy that made it all happen. A fabulous team.  Louis, you had an opportunity to study many scholar development  programs across the country. From your unique perspective, what have  you observed about the successful programs? What have been  components and factors that stand out?  I have noticed in my seventeen years with the Truman Foundation, I   ve  visited some 240 college campuses. From the University of the Virgin  Islands in the south, to the University of Maine in the north, to the  University of Alaska at Fairbanks in the way northwest, to the  University of Hawaii to the University of Guam, and a whole lot of them  in between. What   s it take for success? One, certain values of the  institution that attracts students. Two is an appreciation by the same  administration of this and the willingness to commit some manpower to  make it happen. And third, a staff person like Bob Graalman who says,  7  Gill  Blair  Gill  Blair  Gill  Blair  Gill  Blair  Gill  Blair     Yes.    Now, Truman Foundation gives about 75 scholarships a year. It  sounds like a big number, but realize that  there are  3,000 junior  colleges and four-year colleges. Now, it   s not likely you   re going to get  one of these unless you have terrific students, every college has, and  somebody works hard at it.  About seventy to seventy-five a year are given out?  Yes.  Louis, in your opinion, what should be the mission and the goals of a  successful scholar development recognition program? I mean, is it just  about receiving prestigious scholarship?  No. It   s finding a group of great students and not molding them, but  bringing out what is in that person. So, you don   t say,    Hey, you   re a  hot-shot student. We   re going to turn you into a public servant or a  Truman Scholar.    It   s saying,    You   ve shown you   ve got these values,  these commitments. Let   s talk about the Truman. Now let   s go through  the arduous process of the application.    And applying is about like  taking a demanding three-hour class.  What would you say to young men or young women who participate for  a couple years in this program? They   ve competed but never won one of  the scholarship recognitions. What would you say to them?  Well, sometimes we make mistakes.  (Laughter) Good answer, good answer.  But we try to be up-front to anybody applying and say,    Look, the odds  are ten in one. Through the process you   re going to write better. You   ll  become more focused on what to do after OSU. You make friendships  with folks like Bob Graalman. You can   t lose.    And we did a follow-up  survey of one year after people got the letter that says    you lost    to see  how they felt, and roughly 92 percent said they were pleased they  applied even though they hadn   t been selected. If they went on to  graduate schools, they   d already done most of the application. They  were focused. They knew what they wanted to do. They made some  friends.  Well, how did you first learn about the OSU Scholar Development  Program? Through Dr. Henry Bellmon?  Bob Graalman.  8  Gill  Blair  Gill  Blair  Gill  Blair  Gill  Blair  Gill  Blair  Gill  Blair  Can you talk about relationships that you   ve had with OSU through the  years, you know, milestones of the program, people relationships,  scholars that you remember?  Oh, I have had a friendship with Bob Graalman. Bob   s become family.  Jim Halligan, they   ve been house guests. Chris Stephens has been a  house guest. I really don   t have a lot of house guests. There have been  others that were just abundant with affection, friendship. I mean, we  become friends. There   s another university in this state, the College of  Sour Cream and Crimson, and I don   t think I have a friend there.  (Laughs) That speaks well for you. You   ve observed OSU from what, the  early    90s? From your perspective, how has it evolved and developed  through the years, do you think?  Oh, I think so far it has developed stunningly well. What has  happened   and OSU has had some success recently but not as much.  Not that OSU isn   t terrific, but a lot of other places have gotten into  scholar development big time, and so the recruiting, the preparation, the  mentoring has increased at a number of other places.  Was OSU one of the early adapters, if you will, in your program?  Yes, probably.  Outside the private universities.  Yes, the first one that really professionalized it was Kansas State  University, and that shows you, you don   t have to be Ivy League to win.  And Kansas State did very well in the    80s, and still does well but not  spectacular. Others have showed up. Same thing with OSU.  Louis, what do you feel are the strengths of OSU   s Scholar Program?  Commitment by Graalman. The willingness of the institution to have a  guy like Bob Graalman. And third, I think there   s a modesty inherent  here on this campus, and I think there   s a service ethic that comes from  being a land-grant institution.  Are there components in the program that you feel like could be  enhanced, maybe even added that we don   t have?  Oh, yes, yes. I would love to see another staff person there. I   d love to  see an endowment that makes it a permanent entity. Those are probably  the two that just jump out at me.  9  Gill  Blair  Gill  Blair  Gill  Blair  Gill  Blair  Gill  Blair  Gill  Since you   ve retired from your position as Executive Director of the  Truman Fund, you continue to visit the university, which we are  delighted that you do. What keeps you coming back to Oklahoma State,  and what   s the nature of that relationship?  I believe in this place. I believe in the mission of it. I love the students  from here. Every year Bob turns out a dozen for me to meet. I want to  take them home  And then the people, Jerry, like you, that I   ve just  become friends with over the decades.  Do you give some kind of a support counsel to the program? I know I   ve  talked to Bob Graalman, and we invite you back and want you back  anytime to pick your brain a little bit, and you get a chance to visit with  some of our prospective scholars or some of our faculty and staff when  you   re here.  Yes, and I   m meeting with, this time, twelve to fifteen people who want  to go on and do great things. And let me be honest about it. You guys  make sure I have a terrific time here.  (Laughs) OSU hospitality, Louis.  Football games, basketball games, meals, whatever. I have a good time  here.  Do you feel good about giving us some advice? I mean helping us out,  providing some council about things we could be doing, improving on.  Do you do some of that when you   re back with us?  Some, but I mean I   ve also written you guys a check. I   ve given you  more than I   ve given the Alumni Association at my university, my  undergraduate alma mater.  Louis, how do you feel the scholarship program has enriched Oklahoma  State University?  Well, the guy to ask that is Jim Halligan. Halligan really thinks it has  shifted some of the emphasis here, so let me punt on that. Let me refer  that to my colleague and friend Jim Halligan.  I had a conversation with Bob Graalman about this earlier, and I asked  Bob candidly. Bob and I have been friends a long time; I could do that.  Were there some skeptics when the program first started, and certainly  there were, but did that change? I think there   s been a real paradigm  shift on this campus on how they perceive the program, its value, and do  you feel that, yourself?  10  Blair  Gill  Blair  Gill  Blair  Gill  Blair  Gill  Blair  Yes, yes. Now, I thought   I mean, Jim Halligan bought into it. I thought  David Schmidly bought into it, as well, and I   m hoping Burns  Hargis   buys into it. And Burns has got so many things on his plate, but I hope  he buys into this.  Your relationship has been ongoing. We talked about that. Are there  some stories you can recall, some human interest stories that you can  share about your experiences at OSU with some of the Truman Scholars  or some of the faculty? There   s got to be some good stories there.  Well, one that jumps to mind is I was here a few years ago for a football  game, and I got all excited. OSU was up by three touchdowns over  Texas. I was cheering,    Yea, yea, yea     Nobody else was cheering. And,  of course, then we wound up losing that game. Other human interest  stories, hmm.  Do you have some good Bob Graalman stories you can tell me? Surely,  there   s some good stories on Bob?  Oh, I wouldn   t want those on the record. (Laughter) I wouldn   t tell you  those with the microphone on  But, I mean, the stories I like are the ones  of friendship, be it Jim Halligan, Jim Bernard, you, Peter Sherwood, Bob  Graalman, Edward Jones, just on and on.  Have you maintained any contacts with the former scholars? You  mentioned Chris. Earlier you talked about Shannon Ferrell.  Chris I stayed in  touch with . Yes, Jerry, I discovered that you have a  lot more friends when you   re writing checks, (Laughter) and when you  turn in that checkbook, the phone doesn   t ring as often. But no, any  teacher knows that you have wonderful relationships with students in the  classroom, and 90 percent of them you   ll never hear from again.  Well, you alluded to this a little bit earlier and I want to pick up your  comments about how you perceive Oklahoma State. Are there some  special characteristics that you identify with OSU students that typify  OSU?  Well, by and large, I think there   s a lack of arrogance, so the positive is  some humility. I think there   s a willingness to exert yourself, to prove  yourself. I think there   s a roundedness that comes from FFA, from small  towns, from a sense of community. I mean, everybody I meet here  comes from a community they love. You know, at Memphis, I couldn   t  wait to get away from home. And yes, I think these people have a sense  of home. Terrific question.  11  Gill  Blair  Gill  Blair  Gill  Blair  Gill  Blair  Gill  Blair  Gill  Blair  You were many years with the Truman program. As you think back and  reflect on that, what do you think the values are? What   s the long-term  impact of the Truman Scholarship program in people   s lives and  communities and universities?  Well, I hope the Truman Foundation has shifted career paths, make  people aware of some opportunities that they wouldn   t have had  otherwise. Someone like Shannon Ferrell that says,    Here   s another  reason why you come back.    Or to Tom Jenkins that says,    We believe  in your ambition to become a firefighter.    I think we   ve given  affirmation to some folks.  Do you feel these people have made a difference in the world, in the  lives of others?  Yes. My view of if you   ve made a difference, if you help one person,  you   ve made a difference in the world. One person outside your family.  So, Truman Foundation, fortunately, was never about who is going to be  the next president. Are you going to be the next president, but more  about are you going to go out and do good things because of your nature.  If I remember this correctly, I think in 2000, the Truman Scholarship  Foundation recognized Oklahoma State University as a Truman Honor  Institution.  It was.  What are the primary criteria for recognition, and what did OSU do to  earn this special recognition?  They reward it to those who do exceptionally well in the competition.  Two, was to some manifest a set of values, the institution itself that says  public service is important. We   re promoting this not just to have a  trophy to hang on the wall, but this is part of our mission. Land-grant  institutions are all about service mission.  I understand   in the conversation earlier, we talked about your friend  Henry Bellmon. I understand you made a personal gift to the Henry  Bellmon Fund?  Yes.  What influenced you to make that gift?  Belief in the institution. Belief in Henry Bellmon. Belief in Bob  Graalman. And I thought and I hope, and I think mine was the first gift  12  Gill  Blair  Gill  Blair  Gill  Blair  Gill  Blair  Gill  Blair  that maybe this starts something rolling. Now, I didn   t give  10-20  million dollars, I gave  1,000. A thousand for me is   that   s a substantial  contribution. But just to show I believe.  And that speaks volumes to how you feel about the program.  I   m putting my money on the line.  Not equal gifts, but equal sacrifice, right? (Laughs)  Well, it wasn   t a huge sacrifice. I didn   t have to go on bread and water  for a week, (Laughter) but I wanted to show.  Getting back to who this guy Louis Blair is, do you mind a couple  personal questions Louis?  By all means.  You   ve had considerable experience in helping develop US policy, I  think, as a White House Congressional staff member, as a consultant  and an analyst. Can you tell me about those experiences, how they   ve  influenced your life?  Yes. When I was young, I thought I was going to become the  administrator of NASA. I was mayor of Falls Church,  Virginia .  Thought I   d become a congressman. As I sort of moved around the  bureaucracy and in the White House, I realized that even the president  on his own can   t do much. There   s lots and lots of folks, and I said,    I   m  going to have something small where they give me the responsibility. I  can run it. I can tell you where every dollar has gone. And small is  beautiful.    So, I   ve really   and now I teach at VMI  Virginia Military  Institute . I   m one-on-one with students. And that   s how I see myself: a  change agent. Small steps but changing folks.  That   s great. Can you tell me a little bit about your early life, where you  grew up? I know I   ve kind of jumped up a little bit, but your engineering  degrees and your master   s at MIT, and yet it seems like you went a  different direction in your life. But there must have been some influences  early in your life. Could you share a little bit of that?  Well, I was orphaned when I was young, when I was five. Was taken in  by a great-aunt, surrounded with love. Had a proverbial rich uncle who  sent me to college, didn   t give me much guidance. I was good in math so  I said,    Well, I   ll try engineering,    and went that way. And then  in   graduate school I realized I wasn   t going to become a PhD in  engineering. I bumped around in serendipity. Odds of divine  13  Gill  Blair  Gill  Blair  Gill  Blair  Gill  Blair  intervention or divine guidance or whatever has just moved me around.  And someone asked me, originally, have I made any mistakes in life? Of  course, everybody makes mistakes, but I don   t have any major regrets  about where I am, what I   m doing, who I   m married to, who my friends  are.  I   m going to ask you this question. It may seem strange.  Bring it on, Jerry.  Who   s the real Louis Blair? There   s the political wonk. You   ve moved  over now. Let me just say you were on some major staff assignments in  committees in the Senate and the House and the White House and some  high level experiences. So, there   s the political wonk, the scholarship  foundation executive, student development person, the French chef. You  went to France for training. There   s the adventurous equestrian; you   ve  ridden horses all around the world. The public servant, the mayor of  Falls Church, Virginia. Who   s the real Louis Blair?  Well, I mean, I have a little passionate bio and I can send it to you if you  like. I mean, first and foremost you must understand at the center of my  life is my wife Suzanne, the wind beneath my wings. Second is I am  great by myself for about fifteen minutes. I need a community around  me. So, I need a community. Third, I need young people. I try to give  some ideas and so teaching is part of that. I love the outdoors, be it in the  woods or the farm, cutting firewood and riding horses. And fifth is I   m a  foodie. I mean, now playfully I was telling somebody, it   s not that I   m  obsessed with food. It   s just that I don   t think about anything else, but  I   m not obsessed. I   m a foodie. I   m a devoted husband. I like to think of  myself as an educator. I like to think of myself as an outdoorsman and  horses, and policy wonk no more. Foundation executive, no.  Living the good life now.  Hey. But I   m in Oklahoma, meeting with folks, getting ready for a big  football game, you bet   Well, how do you hope people remember Louis Blair? I mean looking  back at your life and a lot of things, how do you hope people remember  you?  Well, one with a smile. And sessions that maybe some of those folks  will remember,    Well, if it hadn   t been for Louis Blair,    (and this is sort  of for Truman Scholars)    I wouldn   t have gone that way, and I   m glad I  did.    Now, a friend of mine was a setup person for Dolly Parton, and so  she asked Dolly, she said,    Well, Dolly, a hundred years from now, what  14  Gill  Blair  Gill  Blair  Gill  Blair  Gill  Blair  Gill  do you hope folks will be saying about you?    And Dolly   s response was,     I hope they   re saying she looks great for her age.    A hundred years  from now, I hope I   m not here, but I hope maybe there   s some story  about me.  Well, just in closing, what advice would you   you really observed  Oklahoma State University and our Scholar Development Program. I   m  trying to think of a word other than    advice.    What suggestions, what  would you say to keep on doing? What are we doing right? Going  forward, how the environment   s changing, what do we need to do?  What advice would you give us?  Well, I mean the advice is, try to put this scholar development set of  activities on some permanent basis. Now, it may not just be about  scholarships per se, but about enriching educational experience so it   s  not just in the classroom September through May. That   s the Cambridge  program; that   s the Wentz Foundation. That is somebody trying to have  folks look for outside opportunities. And one of the reasons I gave the  money is I think if it   s not endowed, if Bob Graalman retired, it   s very  easy someday to say,    Cut it out.    Then, it   s ever so hard to bring it  back. Will there be another situation where there   s a Henry Bellmon that  meets a Louis Blair, that   s referred to Bob Graalman with a Jim Halligan  there that says,    Let   s make this take off   ?  We like to feel that we had some success, and you guys validate that with  our designation as a Truman Institute Scholarship. What components  have you appreciated the most about our program? What do you think  has been the most valuable in creating that kind of program we have?  What   s made it go?  Well, there   s been several things. One has certainly been Bob Graalman.  Second, it   s been like the ag department, Ed Miller and some others  really buying into this.  So, faculty engagement and involvement?  Faculty engagement, and saying,    We   re going to find our best folks for  Bob.    So, it has been Karl Reid saying,    We   ve got to make sure we   ve  got engineers participating.     Bob Spurrier in the Honors program.  Bob Spurrier, yes. Sorry, Bob, I should have mentioned you. Bob there,  pushing them to enter it.  There are so many things we   d like to ask you and I probably left out.  15  Blair  Gill  Blair  Gill  Are there some things that you   d like to share with us or comments that  we haven   t touched on or covered that you   d want to leave with us at  this time?  Well, I   ve got a lot of orange and black and no crimson and cream.  (Laughter) No, what I want to leave with you is I hope I   ll be back and  you   ll have more questions for me.  Great. We look forward to you coming back. You know you   re always  welcome.  I know that, and Jerry, I   ll be back.  Thank you.  -------  -------
