 Little Thunder  My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is April 18, 2011 and  I   m interviewing Donald Vann for the Oklahoma Native Artists Project  sponsored by the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at  Oklahoma State University. We   re here with Donald in Tahlequah,  and  we are also joined by Scott Bernard . Donald, you   re one of the most  prominent Indian artists of your time. You   ve had a long career that  shows no signs of slowing down, and you   re back in Tahlequah after  forty-one years in Texas, I understand.  That   s right. We are looking forward to doing a lot of things here in the  area, once we get squared away with our business. When you   ve just  moved back to an area, there   s a lot of work to be done. So, that   s what  we   re working on now.  We   re glad to have you back in Oklahoma.  Thank you.  Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  I was born here in Oklahoma, over in Adair County, outside of Stillwell,  let   s see, back in 1949. (Laughs)  What did your folks do for a living?  Well, my father did a lot of labor and jobs. There   s so many jobs that he  did over time, it   s kind of hard to describe  all  he was doing. For thirty-two  years that I remember, he was working for the Alabama Charcoal  Company in Baron. And then he went on to do other jobs with the tribe,  and he retired twenty-five years ago.  I understand your grandparents lived close by?  5  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  My grandparents did live just a few hundred yards from where I was  brought up. My grandfather was my biggest inspiration growing up. He  had a big influence on most of the things I remember, some of the  artwork that I do. He had great knowledge of the spiritual world and the  medicines. He was a holy man, so he and I spent a lot of time together.  I understand you also spent time hunting with your grandfather.  Yes, one of the things that I remember, years later, about growing up in  Adair County outside of Stillwell, was that I was very fortunate to have  two sets of grandparents, which a lot of us usually do, and they were  both a big part of my growing up. On my father   s side, his name was  White Vann, and he was more into the mountains and hunting. He was  the one that was a big influence in being out there in the woods and the  wilderness. So, a lot of the things that I know about that general area is  due to my grandfather on my father   s side.  My grandfather on my mother   s side was a holy man,  what they called   Raven Mockers. He was always healing people. I say,    Raven Mockers      because  he didn   t hide that he was. That   s another thing that I   d like to  talk about, Raven Mockers. People who never really grew up with that  knowledge   it   s just one of the things that they learned from books or  people talking about it. Raven Mockers were not all that bad. A lot of  things that are written about Raven Mockers are false. The people who  wrote these books did not grow up around them. I do not remember one  person that he ever harmed. He was always doing good medicine for  people. I can talk in great depth about that maybe a little bit later.  What are your first memories of drawing or painting?  Well, the first time that I remember getting paid for anything that I did  was back when I was in the fifth grade. (Laughs) Lucille Starr, who was  my first, second, and third grade school teacher, had me do religious  drawings for a project. I forgot exactly what it was about. She paid me  seventy-five cents, and I thought that was a lot of money back in those  days. So, that kind of got me kind of interested,    Well, if I can get  seventy-five cents for these drawings, maybe I can do something else  and get more money out of it.    But that was not until much later. So,  that kind of put the hook in me. (Laughter)  I understand you had to make your own painting supplies when you  started out.  Yes, I did, because back in those days, finance was very, very limited.  Whatever finance the parents made went to raising the family. There  6  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  was nothing available to buy professional equipment. So, actually, I  imitated a lot of the paintbrushes that I   d seen a lot of people using or  used. I would clip off the little hair on the tip of dogs    tails   they   re  kind of pointed. (Laughter) And I would tie them with a rubber band or  twine onto a stick to make a paint brush. I melted crayons for paint. Of  course, they got hard real quick, too. (Laughter)  That   s very creative. Was one of the pluses of elementary school that you  had access to supplies?  At school I did, but a lot of times back in those days, they did not want  you to take anything away from the school. So, sometimes I actually  stole a few things just so I could     Experiment     Nobody ever missed them anyway.  Did they offer art classes at the elementary level?  The only art classes, if you will, were when I got into the third and  fourth and fifth grades. There was a lady whose last name was Catron  from Vian. Shirley Catron, and she had been educated in art at a  university. Friday everybody looked forward to,  because that  was the  afternoon where everybody was going to do art of their choice. She was  very instructive, very good about color and material. Whatever the  school provided is what we used for art back in those days. She was one  of the most beautiful ladies I   ve ever seen who was a teacher. (Laughter)  She really enjoyed what I did. She paid especially close attention to what  I was doing because she said that I was much further ahead in that area  than any other students were, even though I didn   t do well in all three  grades, the third, fourth, and fifth. (Laughs) But she said that I did very  well in the art area, so I made straight A   s. (Laughs)  That   s wonderful to have that kind of support and encouragement. What  kinds of images did you create in your free art time?  Let   s see, the Beatles were starting to come in back in those days. So, I  did a lot of drawing of the Beatles. Also cars and different kinds of  animals like horses. Even though horses were kind of a premium back in  those days   not everybody had them   I was lucky enough to be able to  grow up in a home where my grandfather had horses, so I knew and  studied about the anatomy. But cars, not everybody had cars, so I had to  guess at that. (Laughter) The Beatles, you saw them on TV a lot, so I  knew what they looked like. (Laughter)  7  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  You spoke Cherokee at home?  Cherokee was my first language growing up. I didn   t learn to speak  English until I was like five, six, maybe seven years old. That was one of  the hard things about being in a public school. A lot of times, we were  punished for speaking Cherokee in class. It   s just one of those things that  reminds me, this was only just a few years ago in time. But we were  allowed to speak Cherokee out in recess time, out on the grounds. I  remember several of my cousins getting whipped. Even I got a little bit  of discipline, which was very traumatic to you when you   re young like  that.  Did you have any extended family, uncles or anybody, who painted?  Actually, none of my uncles were in that area, but I remember a distant  relative who was always doing some drawings. His name was Charles  Leo Vann, from Pryor. Every once in a while, he would come over. Of  course, he was a lot older than I at the time and already well developed  in his talent, and I admired a lot what he did. Today, you can see some  of his work around Pryor, Salina.  Was that maybe your first example of Indian art that you saw?  Well, that was my first example of something that a developed artist did  that was quality work and that really, really impressed me. And years  later, it was an honor to meet an upcoming artist from Muskogee,  Oklahoma. His name was Jerome Tiger. He and his agent, Nettie  Wheeler, had a big impact on my development to the point where I am  today. Jerome was probably one of the biggest, most important  influences.  That   s interesting because you both have that same love of anatomy, the  rendering of the human body in this very beautiful way. How did you  meet Jerome the first time?  Well, it was one of those things where a young kid my age in grade  school had a hard time being in class. (Laughs) We walked several miles  to school back in those days. By choice, actually. Later on, we got a  regular school bus to ride in, but before then, it was kind of like a farm  truck that used to come and pick us up. But since school was not that far,  we walked to school. Sometimes we got there. (Laughter) Most of the  time we didn   t. So, social workers were out to help children my age, to  give more direction. A lot of programs  were  coming up at that time,  John F. Kennedy   s time   he started a lot of tech schools. There was, I  think, about three at the time. If I   m wrong, correct me, but they were  Job Corps centers.  8  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  This social worker came over to the house and said that I was reported  as being a problem student.    There   s an option that you can take, either  Job Corps or, I know that you have this talent, and I am acquainted   with  this lady in Muskogee that could help you.    So, she took me over  to Muskogee to the Thunderbird Gift Shop. I met Nettie Jane Wheeler,  and she said,    This is what I   m doing with Jerome Tiger.     I   d never heard of the name before until then. And she named other  known artists of those times, and before. Acee Blue Eagle and Paul  Pahsetopah.  I   d  never heard of them. She said,    This is what I   m  helping them do, and I   d like to develop you. Jerome is willing to meet  you and help you with it, too.    So, we did. Jerome was one of the most  fantastic persons that I had ever met. Some of the things that he was  doing, I was just in awe. I thought he was like a God. (Laughter) Even  though Jerome was Creek, he was not Cherokee, we both resonated  extremely well. He said,    You have something that I see you can  develop.    He told me,    You have to do it your own way. Don   t copy  me.    But everybody did at that time. (Laughs) That went over very well  for a couple of seasons. Then I was still having that problem in school,  so I looked at Job Corps.  Had you been meeting with Jerome over at Nettie   s or going over there  once a week?  Yes. I did go on to Job Corps. I went up to Anaconda, Montana. I was  there for, I want to say, two months? Maybe three. Whatever you wanted  to learn, they taught you. I learned heavy equipment and maintenance  and earned a GED at the time. Then I came back from Job Corps and  started right back up with Nettie and Jerome. And right after that,  Jerome passed away     It must have been hard on you.  Yes, very devastating to me because I admired him so much. Today, his  memory has a very big impact on me.  Were you about seventeen or sixteen?  No, no, actually, I was going on fifteen. So, I went back to high school  even though I had a GED. Technically, I graduated in    68, but I had to  take half a year over again to graduate. By that time, I was working full-time  as a professional artist.  Showing mainly in Nettie   s gallery?  9  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  Nettie Wheeler was still my agent at that time, and she had full control  of my work. She was selling my artwork all over the country, and we  were doing shows. I think it was in    66 or    67. The Five Civilized Tribes  Museum art show   that was the first time they had  it , I believe.  Johnny Tiger and Virginia Stroud, we were the First Place winners over  there. (Laughter)  Do you remember who the judges were?  I forgot who the judges were. It might have been Kilpatrick, I believe it  was.  Jean Kilpatrick?  Yes, and Maurice Devina, I believe, was another judge at that time. He  was a news  reporter  for the Tulsa World. I think, because this was long  ago. (Laughs)  Was that your first museum show?  It was one of the biggest moments of my life. Everybody is  congratulating you, and of course, everybody is saying,    We   re sorry  that Jerome is not here.    I   m not tooting my own horn or anything like  that, but pretty much thereafter, people thought I was going to be the  next Jerome Tiger because I was doing a lot of that type of work. Then,  also, when I used to go his house and paint on his table, they thought I  was going to be showing that  kind of work . I told them I never would  because Jerome was an artist that did what he did and nobody could ever  fit his shoes. Nobody ever has.  We all go on to do what we do. One of the things he always said was,     Don   t let anybody tell you what to do. You do what the spirit tells  you,    is what he always said. (Laughs) He was a very spiritual man.  Do you remember what your image was for the Five Tribes Museum?  I couldn   t really tell you exactly what they were, but roughly, pulling an  image out of the air, they probably were the Trail of Tears, because  everybody was painting the Trail of Tears back in those days. (Laughs)  And stickball players. (Laughs)  What was your next career move after selling with Nettie?  I came home from the  Vietnam  war in    73. Nettie was at a very old  age, and she was going in to  the hospital at that time. So, another  gentleman from Austin and I picked up together. We started our own  10  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  company down in Austin, Nowotahee Galleries. He played the same role  that Nettie Wheeler did. He was my agent for over forty years.  And traveled to different shows with you?  Yes, we went all over the world with our shows.  What were some of the highlights?  Being able to visit foreign countries, Europe, England, and people who  had never experienced my type of work before. Of course, I was not the  first American Indian artist to be shown in those areas because it goes so  far back. Some of the old-timers actually visited Germany, Switzerland,  England, Rome. But they had their own style. This was their first time  experiencing what I did. It was well-received, especially in Germany. A  lot of the German people had a very, very big admiration for the Native  Americans.  What was your style like at that point?  Like I said earlier, most of my styles were the Jerome Tiger styles.  Everybody who was  an  upcoming artist had that style, too. Everybody  was copying him. Of course, there were good artists out there that did  very, very good work. But they didn   t have that creativity that Jerome  had. They thought,    I can draw just as good as he can. If I can draw it as  good as he can, I can make money.     Money was the big thing back in those days. A lot of them did copy,  down to the detail, what he did. But as the era went on, people who  were n   t  gifted to do it their own way, couldn   t keep up. They fell off to  the wayside. Today, nobody knows what became of them. Then there   s  others that just popped up out of nowhere, overnight. You go out  to   New York and California and places like that, and nobody ever heard of  them. They thought that they could do the same things that Jerome did.  (Laughs) That circulated out quickly. People just kind of burned out.  Now, people are looking for individuals who have their own spirit style.  Again, I   m not tooting my own horn because it took me years to develop  what I do now.  How did you find your way into the really detailed landscapes?  It takes a lot of in-depth thinking about where you   re at with your work.  A lot of shows that you go to, people say,    Oh, you paint like this  person. You paint like that person.    I didn   t think so. When you stand  back and look at it,    Yes, yes, I did. What about doing what Donald  Vann can do?    I   m talking about years ago, where it   s developed from  11  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  the early beginning, up to what it is today. You have to listen to anything  that inspires the soul, not how people paint. Some paintings do inspire  you, but that doesn   t mean you have to go copy. You have to listen to  nature. You have to listen to your spirit and your heart, and you have to  listen to what maybe the elders said a long time ago.  One thing I really love about your paintings is, it   s not just the eyes that  they appeal to, there   s a whole sensory experience. It   s like you see, you  hear things. You can get the feeling of being inside that landscape. Are  you consciously kind of striving for that?  I   m always striving for something that inspires. Like right now, you can  look outside and see the moving leaves. That could trigger an inspiration  of something. You can hear the wind blow. A lot of times that will  inspire you, if it   s just the right time. Sometimes, one word that a person  says can inspire a whole finished painting in your head. Even a bird  flying can inspire something. So, you   re always open, I guess. The inner  soul of you is listening all the time. And you know it, and you hear it.  There have been two different threads that run through your work. One  has been Cherokee imagery and another has been Plains imagery. When  did you first get interested in that?  That has been one of the most powerful questions that people have asked  me for many years.    You   re Cherokee, and you   re doing Plains Indians.     Well, back at the beginning of the popularity of Indian art paintings,  people didn   t really recognize Cherokees as Indian because the  Cherokees were very big into copying the European way in lifestyle and  dress. They copied the headdress, the coats, the turban, which was not  traditional. They didn   t wear feathers. They didn   t ride the horses. They  didn   t live in tipis. So, I kind of had to go back to portray the American  Indian not tribalized, kind of generically,  to  say,    This is what the  Plains Indians did.    Because I don   t know enough, in detail,  about  all  the tribes out there who are Plains Tribes, to say,    This is the Sioux. This  is the Arapaho. This is the Cheyenne.    I dare not, because if you do, you  better know it.  But when it comes to Cherokee, I can, because I know more about  Cherokees than other people who are painting Cherokees. I speak the  language, too. Fluently. At the time when I was painting Plains-type  themes, that   s what the general public was looking for. When people  think of Indian paintings, they want to see them riding horses, chasing  buffalo, feathers in their hair. Burial themes, scaffolds, living in tipis.  That   s why I did that because that   s what was selling back in those  times. I could paint a Cherokee painting, and it would sit there. Nobody  would know what it was because Cherokees didn   t have the feathers in  12  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  their hair. (Laughs)  A lot of artists went through that.  It   s a kind of  give-and-take, where  the artists educate the public and bring them along, but you still have to  make a living.  Right. That   s what sold back in those days.  There was  a certain time  period back in the    80s, when we went to a western and Indian show in  Denver, Colorado. I   m the one person that appreciates western paintings,  I really do. I think they do great work. But back at that time, western art  was not selling. So, when we got there, I looked around and wanted to  see some cowboy paintings. They were all painting Indians because  cowboy art wasn   t selling. (Laughter) Even the mountain men painters,  they were painting Indians.  So, it went through a period when people   it was all Indian. Right after  Dances with Wolves. My god, the Indian stuff just exploded. Everybody  wanted something to do with Indians at the time. Everybody was part  Cherokee. (Laughs) We had so many people come to our shows who  claimed to be Cherokee, with their great-great-grandmother being  Cherokee princesses. (Laughs) I told them my great-great-grandfather  was a Cherokee princess. (Laughter) We don   t talk about him, though.  Keep it in the closet. It was a big joke. (Laughter) There were no  Cherokee princesses back in those days. That was a hobbyist thing.  You   ve always incorporated animal imagery in your paintings, and I  understand you were involved with a wolf project in Minnesota?  Yes, when I lived in Minnesota. There was a time when I had a couple  of residences, and I did a lot of my work right outside of Minneapolis in  the winter months. I had a lot of collectors who lived up in those areas  and also, some real good collectors who lived in Madison. They worked  with wildlife biologists, researched there, out at the university, and they  knew that I was very much into wolf imagery by that time.  I  was  invited to go with them when so many Canadian wolf packs were  coming into Minnesota. They were all coming into the Boundary  Waters. Of course, when you have so many packs that come into the  United States in that area, there   s problems.  Anyway, to make a long story short, I was asked if I wanted to join them  for that time, which I did. It gave me  a  really, really great photography  opportunity and movie opportunity.  Wildlife biologists are good with wildlife, but they   re not good trackers.  (Laughter) The project was to count undocumented packs. The  Boundary Waters were not funded for that kind of an expedition, which  13  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  was totally voluntary. Our part was to document undocumented packs  coming into the Boundary Waters. If you get too many packs in one  area, they start killing each other or they start killing off too much  livestock or wildlife in those areas. The sad part was that some of them  had to be put away as we contacted them. Not from our group   we just  documented where all these packs were. A pack of ten to twelve wolves  need at least seventy-five miles square of territory. You get fifteen or  twenty packs in seventy-five miles square, that   s not good. So, that was  our part.  You did this for about a year?  Actually, I didn   t do that a total year. We were out there two times. The  first time was the longest time, over six weeks we were out there. The  second time was towards the fall. The first time you have to go in the  spring to see what packs have litter. Then in the  fall , you go back out  to those same areas to see how they thrived or have they moved on  elsewhere. A lot of times they didn   t. They were actually not doing well.  The last time when we were there in September of that year, they were  eating bugs. There was a lot of insects in their diet.  Sometimes the business part of art is the hardest part to learn. It sounds  like you   ve been fortunate to have good business partners. In terms of  what you print and when you print, how do you go about deciding?  Actually, right now, today, as we speak, I   m very blessed with a whole  new company. It   s set up, and I   m very blessed by the Great Spirit, the  Creator, that I have a partner that is very talented, very gifted. He   s an  artist in his own way, marketing and understanding these things. Scott  Barnard has been really a great inspiration to me in a lot of ways, and  also  in  making those decisions. He and I resonate so well together, we  think alike, almost. (Laughs) He   s the printer, and he   s the editor, and  he   s my CEO. He   s the man that says,    Yup, it   ll sell. Nope, it won   t  sell.    (Laughs)  So, we   re talking about in-house printing your company does?  Yes. We have our own printer set up, and we   re looking forward to  purchasing bigger printers a little bit later, so we can do a lot bigger  giclees. He being an expert in technology, he   s the man that knows how  to make giclees work in the way that is higher quality than some of the  other giclees out there that we   ve seen printed. We   re trying to do away  with off-set printing because off-set printing is a thing of the past now.  Giclees on canvases is the in-thing today. You can print giclees on  thicker paper   they look nice. But something about printing on canvas  gives it that quality, that classy look.  14  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  I   m wondering what changes you saw between Oklahoma Indian art in  the    80s, and then in the    90s.  I think in the    80s into the    90s was a great boom for any kind of art     tribal art, jewelry, paintings. Not tooting my own horn, but we did  extremely well in the    80s. But something happened towards the    90s  where it started kind of slowly, slowly, taking a backseat to everything  else. We need another movie, Dances with Wolves or something like  that, to get people refocused. But it   ll have to be a lot, because right  now, I believe that a lot of the general, mass-produced trinket stuff,  trinkets that people have put out kind of ruined the market. Europeans  come here, the Japanese, the Chinese come here. They think this trinket  stuff that was made overnight is it  They look at something that   s  handmade jewelry, or a painting that took months to do, they look at the  price and go,    My God, I don   t want to pay that. I can buy this little  trinket over here, and it   s the real thing.     That   s where the hobbyists came in and ruined all of that. All due  respect to them, they have to make money, too. They have to earn a  living   that   s where the card-carrying idea came in. Federally-recognized  Indian blood cards came in. So, people like this can   t show at  Indian shows. If you don   t have those cards on you, they won   t let you  in because they   re trying to weed all that out  to  where quality control is  back in. But it   ll be a long time before that will happen. There   s still a  market out there  but  people will only buy something  that   s  unique,  that   s totally different.  You can go to Santa Fe. The last Indian Market I was at in Santa Fe, I  was not showing. I remember Santa Fe twenty, thirty years ago where  there were hoards, masses of people all over Santa Fe. You couldn   t  hardly walk. The last time I was there, it was like the streets were empty,  galleries were empty almost. Even the market itself was not as big as it  used to be. Everywhere you looked, galleries had pots, pots, pots, pots,  pots. How many pots can you have? Paintings and paintings and jewelry.  Pawn jewelry. Outside of Santa Fe, there were, again, these trinket  people. Jewelry made in China, Japan. Plastic turquoise stones. I think it  just kind of burned out. People have pretty much burned out of it. You  go out to New York, same thing. You have to find that right person  that   s still interested in something totally unique that is original. They  know it, and they   ll buy it.  I was going to ask you when the last time you did Santa Fe Indian  Market was.  I lost my shirt. (Laughs) I lost my shirt. (Laughs) I went in    94, and it  15  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  was not good. You heard about people doing well, but it depends on  what    well    is to them. But I was very disappointed with that.  You   re getting ready to open a studio as well as a gallery here in  partnership with Scott, in Tahlequah.  Yes. My partner and I, Scott, we   re working very hard finding the right  location here in Tahlequah. And when that comes about, we   re going to  work on setting up our own gallery. We may look into setting up a frame  shop with computerized framing equipment, and also a teaching area, so  we can bring in other talented people to teach young people who are  looking to develop their talents. These young people will be interviewed,  not to waste their time,  to make sure this  young person is really  focused  on  the future with their talent. Those are the kinds of people  that we want to work  with . A lot of times kids will come off the street  and say,    Oh, I want to learn how to paint.    Before you know it, they   re  in prison, or they   re doing something else. That   s a waste of time. We   ll  be looking at working with young people who are totally focused in their  artistic abilities and their talent,  to  develop themselves into the future.  If they want to go and do something else with their education, then we   ll  certainly be happy to back them up on that. But at least they would have  had that certain credibility. We   ll say,    Yes, they did attend our classes.     Will this be your first time teaching young people?  I   ve never really, really taught any young people, per se. Just coaching  here or there, would be the best way to answer that. I never had a place  where I could really do that. But once we get our location, then we   ll be  able to fulfill that dream. Right now, looking around in the local area,  Tahlequah, Stillwell, Westville, there   s a lot of young people who are  loaded with talent, but there   s nobody here to encourage them. Even  some of the tribal leaders aren   t doing anything to encourage them. I  don   t want to say names, but I think that little part that we will do, will  help them. Give them a direction. Then it will have been well worth  it .  Sounds wonderful. You pretty much paint exclusively in water colors, is  that right?  Yes, I do. I experimented with a lot of other mediums years ago, and  watercolor wash has been one of the best working media for me. I   m  very knowledgeable in airbrush techniques, too. A lot of that stuff, we   ll  be teaching the young people, once we get this started.  How important is underpainting for you?  It is important because that   s what   s going to give you the base of your  16  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  painting as you come forward. Underpainting, to me, means that your  background focus has to be just as important as your foreground focus.  You have to get that right.  I understand you have some pretty nice brushes. (Laughs)   400 dollars right here. (Gestures) These are all handmade in England.  (Laughs) The quality of the equipment is what makes the quality of your  work come out. I   ve seen artists who use dime store-type brushes or  Michael   s hobby store brushes, Grumbacher   s, Dick Blick   s, twenty  bucks, thirty bucks. If you   re trying to do a  10,000,  15,000,  25,000  dollar painting, you better be using good equipment. That   s how  important equipment is.  What about preliminary drawings? Do you sketch everything out  beforehand?  Yes, I do. What I like to do is several drawings of different poses. I  noticed that a lot of artists do their drawing, their experimental drawings,  right on the board or right on the canvas. Without doing a preliminary  drawing first. I do, like, five at a time. That way you can overlap each  one and see which one you want to work with. You can do all your  mistakes on the drawing first and change it, if you will. But some of the  artists I   ve seen will go right directly to the board, canvas they   re going  to be working on. And they   re erasing as they   re going along. Then they  paint around it, and you can see the pencil marks. That   s not good.  (Laughter) That   s why I do mine first. Then you transfer it onto your  canvas or watercolor board, because the main focus is to finish your  background first and then concentrate on the main figures   whatever it  may be. That way you don   t have all these pencil drawings and erase  marks, and you   re not painting around them.  Have you ever tried just painting landscapes, or has anybody ever  suggested you could just be a landscape painter?  I have had many people who have asked me to do just landscape, not  necessarily any Indian subject matter, and that   s fine. Sometimes  landscapes can speak for themselves. You can put a simple bird on there  or maybe a rabbit or maybe a wolf with a nice landscape, and that will  mean a lot to people who feel it spiritually. But I   m not a landscape  artist. (Laughs) I do them as a background. To me, if I did a landscape,  then it   s incomplete. I have to have something up front. (Laughs)  Do you take photographs for your landscape or do you just rely on  memory?  17  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  I do photograph references. I like to do my own photography. Also, my  partner, Scott, a lot of times will take photographs of sunsets for me  while we   re going down the road or if we   re doing something. It   s nice  that somebody has the same eye that I do, and I know that it   s going to  be what I wanted to look at as my background.  It   s always nice to do  photographic  references because it   s forever  changing. Say, if it   s in the evening, you   ve got a beautiful sunset going  on. You look at it again, in the next five seconds, it   s changed. And then  there   s that one scene that      Ah     You want that picture. You want to  capture that on camera because the mind is not going to remember every  detail. (Laughs)  You   re really masterful at getting those effects the airbrush can give. Do  you want to talk a little bit about  that ?  I think airbrush is a very neat tool. Also, airbrush is actually a lot harder  tool to work with than the paintbrush is. Because the airbrush, you   re  always suspended above your paper or your canvas, and you never have  contact with the surface like you do with the brush. So, there   s no room  for mistakes with airbrush. But if you master it right and you know  exactly how it works, and you   ve got your colors right, you   ll do well  with an airbrush. It   s a very nice tool to work with. It   s clean. You can  do backgrounds. The skies with the airbrush, it   s clean. A lot of artists  who use oils or acrylics, they   ll use a brush, a flat brush, and they   ll go  stroking across it. Then when you look at it, it   s going to have that  brushstroke look. Even when it blends in with other colors, it   s going to  have that strokey look. But the airbrush is clean. You don   t see those  strokes on it. The other technique with acrylics or oils, they look nice  from afar, but when you walk right up to it, they have that strokey look  to them. But airbrush, it   s flat, it   s clean, and where the blends come in,  they   re perfect. That   s what   s so nice about airbrush. The rest is up to  the artist, how well they master the airbrush. (Laughs)  How important is telling a story in your work? There seem to be kind of  two veins, establishing the mood, but also this idea of telling the story.  Yes, you   re correct. Setting the mood is very important, and then what  you want to put in is whatever you feel is going to tell a story. A lot of  times, like I said earlier, just a simple bird sitting there can tell a whole  story. Also, some of the images that we   re looking at here in the studio  have a lot of Cherokee images in the paintings. What   s important is what  they   re doing, because it sets the mood. Then you see exactly what   s  going on. (Gesturing at a painting) They   re looking at an eagle who has  just caught a fish and is in flight out. These are Cherokee Indians that  just came out onto the rocks there. They   re not canoes, but dugout  18  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  canoes. Cherokees didn   t have birch bark canoes. To them, it   s like a  sign, it   s a sacred thing to see an eagle and then also, it   s a sign that this  is a good omen, this is a good place for them to be. And the background,  the sunset, is this mood setter.  Do you go so far as to kind of imagine what was happening the moment  before and what   s going to happen when they leave?  Sometimes I do that. I   ll do a continuation of it, sometimes  in another  image . Sometimes you don   t need to go that far. It just stops like that.  There   s no need. Sometimes you   re working on a painting and then,  something else inspires you, all of these other images start coming in.  Before you finish the painting, there   s already another painting that you  see. (Laughs)  You   ve kind of addressed this a little bit, but what is your creative  process?  Well, a creative process can be from whatever inspired. Whatever the  inspiration is, is the beginning of the creative process. Sometimes it can  be just watching a person or maybe just a leaf turning. A lot of times,  you think back, stories that maybe grandparents told you or the elders  told you. Those stories are always ticking in the back of your head, and  those inspire creative processes.  Will you sketch something real quick when it occurs to you, or do you  just file it away, mentally?  To me, I kind of lock it in, in memory, and I give it a title. Then when  the opportunity comes, I   ll sit behind my drawing board and look up that  title in my head. And out comes that inspiration, that thought, because  not all the time does an artist carry sketchbooks around. (Laughter)   On this  print, where the hunter climbed up the tree, followed by the  bear cubs and then their mom, and at the bottom of the tree is the skunk,   what is  the importance of humor?  I like to think that there was a lot of humor that was going on out there at  the time. Today, too. Everything   s not always where you   re starving and  you   re cold and hungry, and somebody   s trying to do away with you. I  believe that there were a lot of humorous things that went on out there.  The one that you   re talking about with the bears climbing up the tree  was just a creative thing   my own sense of humor. (Laughs)  I thought,    If that can happen to anybody, it   s going to happen to me.     (Laughter) A lot of people love that image, but they fail to see the skunk  19  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  at the bottom of tree. They see the bears climbing up behind the Indian  climbing up. And a lot of times the skunk is right there in front of them,  but they don   t really see it.  That   s what makes the title,    A Really Bad Day.    (Laughter)  Yes, having a bad day. Also, skunks climb trees, too. (Laughter) That  was just kind of a creative thing that I came up  with , and people  enjoyed that. Again, like I said, Indians were not always out there cold,  tired, and hungry, in turmoil. A lot of funny things were going on. The  Great Spirit has humor.  Right. (Laughter) Have you ever experimented with sculpture at all?  I   ve never really tried serious sculpture before. I tried one time, and it  just was not my thing.  What is your creative routine?  My creative routine? Trying to make money. (Laughter)  Do you spend a certain number of hours painting or does it just depend  on the day?  No, all joking aside, I spend as much time as I can when I   m in the work  mode. I can sit up thirty-six to forty-eight hours at a time, nonstop.  Nonstop. Sometimes, you   re really on a roll. I stayed up three days one  time, without sleep. Then you take a break, and then you go right back to  it. Trying to build a better mousetrap kind of thing. (Laughter)  Would you rather paint during the day or at night or does it matter?  Again, it   s whatever the mood has you in. It doesn   t matter day or night.  You   re nonstop, you   re working. It   s kind of like a freight train from  coast to coast, it doesn   t stop until it gets to the other end. Day and night.  (Laughter)  Looking back over your career, what was a turning point for you? When  you might have gone this direction, but you decided to go that way.  I don   t think there really ever was a turning point because I   ve always  done this for a living. I   ve painted all my life. I love what I do. I enjoy  what I do. The biggest reward is when you do an image that   s well done  and people resonate with that. They feel that. You don   t have to explain  to them. It projects to them spiritually, inside. A lot of people have cried  in front of my paintings. They felt that, without  me  having to explain  20  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  anything to them. That   s what really, really gives me that fulfillment that  I did something. Even if they couldn   t afford it, they couldn   t even buy  the print, at least I   ve touched somebody or somebody got touched with  what   I don   t want to say  what  I did   the spirit artists that work  through me,  they  are the ones that did that. I   m just a tool. I   m just a  tool.  What   s been one of the highlights of your career?  Going back to what I was just saying, being able to touch people with  what I do. That   s the biggest highlight you can get. Monetarily, that   s  fine, too. A lot of artists, we work for a living just like everybody else,  but sometimes monetarily becomes secondary when you see people,  plain people who are touched by what you   re doing. I could ask for no  bigger reward than that.  What   s been one of the low points in your career so far?  Seeing other artists who tried many years to make it a go and seeing  them destroy themselves. Not my low point, but I see that as a low  point   somebody who had a wonderful career, and all of a sudden,  something happened that they just don   t do anything about. My view of  the low points is that, because they could have done something. But  sometimes things happen in their career where you can   t help them.  Hopefully, I   m strong enough where I can avoid that.  Does it kind of feel like your career is coming full circle by moving back  to Oklahoma?  Well, yes and no. (Laughs) I guess that   s something  that  remains to be  seen. I really don   t know what to expect. But I know what our goals are.  We   re going to work on our goals because nobody is going to help us.  So, we   re going to do it ourselves. Whatever happens around us, that   s  out there. We have focused on our future goals, and we   re going to go  for it the best way we can.  Friendships with artists, starting with Jerome Tiger,  have  been  important in your life. I   m wondering if that   s still a big thread, to be  able to reconnect with some of the people working in Oklahoma.  Well, Jerome Tiger   he was my mentor, which was the highest honor to  me. And that memory. You ask a lot of other artists, they don   t even  know who he is anymore. But the first fifteen, twenty, twenty-five years  a lot of people knew who he was and  he  inspired a lot of people.  Then, all of a sudden, it   s a whole different movement. Young people  21  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  coming up may see some of his artwork, but they  don   t  know how he  really had a big part in the art movement. It kind of reminds me of the  Beatles when they first came to the United States. There were no long-haired  people with guitars, right? Everybody had short,    50s crew cuts.  All of a sudden, they came into the United States, and a month later,  everybody has got long hair, playing a guitar. (Laughs) That   s how he  affected the art world.  So, you may be passing on knowledge about Indian art history along  with painting lessons?  I hope so. I hope just some of the things that I   ve done will eventually  survive and may be able to inspire some future generation. If that  happens, then it will have been well worth what I did. But I   m not  looking for fame and glory. I want my art to be  my  fame and glory, not  me as a person.  Is there anything we   ve forgotten to cover before we take a look at your  paintings? Anything you   d like to talk about that we didn   t?  Well, I   d like to go back to my grandparents, the important part that they  played in my upbringing because back in our days, there was honor in  my family. And  there   s  very few families I   ve seen with this honor  anymore.  The young kids growing up are not learning from parents or grand-parents.  But these were different times, and this is a different time now.  This is the day and age of the computers and iPods and cell phones. Not  once can you see a young kid walking down the street without texting or  a cell phone in their ear. Back in those days, we had our grandparents to  listen to. We heard what they said. We heard the stories they told us. We  watched what they did. Going out into the woods with my grand-mothers,  I watched some of the things that they dug up, some of the  herbs that they collected. They would tell us what this is.    This is edible.  This is what can cure a headache,    or,    This is what will give your sore  throat relief.     How many young kids have grandparents that know these things today?  Not very many. Also, how many grandparents speak Cherokee that can  translate that to the kids? They may speak Cherokee, but their kids are  not even understanding Cherokee. They   re teaching Cherokee again, but  is it too late? Because the grandparents are dying with that knowledge.  That   s one of the things that I really treasure the most, these things that I  learned from both sets of grandparents. And also, spiritual things that  they talked about, the spirits out there that were active. The evil spirits.  Also, people who did conjuring, who did bad medicine to you. Grand-  22  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  father used to say that nobody can do bad medicine to you unless you  want them to. You have to let that in first.  A lot of people say,    Oh, I stubbed my toe on a rock. Somebody is doing  bad medicine on me.    That opens you up. (Laughs) The rest is what you  want to believe. Every time you fall down and land on your knees, you  think somebody is conjuring you. Or you wake up with a fever. (Laughs)     Joe Blow down the road is doing bad medicine on me.    Come on.  (Laughs) That   s some of the things that grandfather used to tell me  about. He said,    A lot of people bring that on themselves. There   s these  other things that you   ll know when something else is going on.     Even though both of my grandfathers were Raven Mockers, like I said,  never once did I see them do any bad medicine to anybody. They were  always healing people. At any given time, you could go to my  grandfather   s house and he   d have ten, fifteen people for the weekend  there, looking for his spiritual guidance, his counseling, his medicine. A  lot of times they all stayed in that house, and he would be healing them.  Also, he was never in need of anything because a lot of people paid him  in so many different ways that he had plenty all the time. He had horses,  he had cattle, pigs, chickens, you name it. People brought him these  things because people did not have money. Every once in a while  somebody had a dime or something. And a lot of times when somebody  couldn   t pay him, just a simple thank you from the heart was more than  you could ask for. That   s what he used to tell me. He said he knew, he  felt that thank you because that   s all they had to give. And that   s how  medicine worked back in those days.  Thank you for sharing that. I wonder if you   d like to talk a little bit  about your paintings. Can I videotape the newest one?  Sure. That   s another thing that a lot of people   a lot of Cherokees, have  a big thing about. Little People or fairies. Fairies are Little People, too.  (Laughs)  (Changing paintings) This is actually somebody you know, whose  daughter came to model?  Scott   s daughter   s good friend from Sequoia, the high school there, her  name is Sunday. She   s quite a striking-looking young lady. I thought  that her profile, her face made a good painting for this. And she   s  wearing a Cherokee Roses dress. I   m sure you probably know about  those.  The title of this one is     23  Bernard  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Barnard  Little Thunder  Vann  Bernard  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  Little Thunder  Vann  It   s Morning Ceremony with the Little People.  The Little People   they   re the elders, the Holy Men. It   s, like, at dawn,  the Little People were around the village. A lot of times they came for  protection. And you could tell that some of them got caught before they  got to all leave. Here   s one that   s kind of still hiding. The rest of them  are going back up into the mountains. They   re doing the medicine  smoke. These are Cherokees. And he   s a Raven Mocker.   What about  these horses?  There   s really no story on them. It   s just two colts and the mama and the  daddy looking on.  Nice little family picture. And this     That   s the one I was talking about where the eagle is a good omen. A  sign of good medicine, yes. Those  warriors  feel like they   re in the right  place. And then also, I said earlier, the sunset sets the mood for that.  Everything that they   re wearing, even to the facial tattoos, the arm  tattoos are historically accurate. I did a lot of research on that.  Wonderful. Thank you so much for your time today, Donald.  You   re welcome.  The Three Sisters over there, that tells the story. It   s the story of corn,  bean, and squash.  If you want me to shoot The Three Sisters, I think it would be a nice one  to finish up with.  Yes, it   s a very, very interesting story but it   s been interpreted in so  many different ways, too. These are real faces, actually.  They   re very realistic.  Actually, this is Morgan, Scott   s daughter, but her hair is dark. The corn  woman had yellow, flowing hair with the shuck. So, that kind of  distracts you. You   d say,    That doesn   t look like Morgan, but if it was  darker hair, it would look like her.    And this is her friend from the  school, Carrie. And this is another one of her friends from the school.  Were they excited to be represented in one of your paintings?  Oh, oh. Yes, yes. We did giclees on it, and we gave them each a print.  24  Little Thunder  Also, this one here is on the humorous side. It was something my dad  told me one time, when he went fishing when he was a little bit younger.  (Laughs) Of course, he wasn   t boat fishing, he was using a fishing cane.  He said he   d had a pretty good afternoon, and he figured he   d caught  enough bass. So, he reeled his line in and there was nothing but fish  heads on that line. He said a turtle has been eating his catch the whole  time. (Laughter) I kind of did that up so the turtle   s eating his fish. The  way he told it in Cherokee was funny. He was like,    I pulled up my line  and there was only fish heads there.    (Laughter)  That   s a nice sampling. Thank you for your time today.  -------  -------
