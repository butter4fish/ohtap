Story_ID: 444326
Speaker 1: And we just wanna ask you a couple of little warm-up questions that are kind of People magazine-ish--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --okay?  So, Mr. Dodd [HistoryMaker Louis Dodd], what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Wow, my favorite food frankly is sole, that's a fish that is popular in England and I can't wait to get back there every, every chance I get--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --to, to share but frankly my wife [HistoryMaker Alma Dodd] has worked hard to perfect the cooking of that fish and consequently I, I enjoy it at home as well.
Speaker 1: And your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: My favorite time of year frankly is my birthday which is February 15th.  I, I, I know that's a sign to say that you're getting older but--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --by the same token I, I enjoy cold weather as well as warm weather but I'm an outdoors person.
Speaker 1: And your favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color frankly is blue.  And I think that has traditionally been a, a man's color anyway.  It's not offensive but certainly a pleasant color in terms of easy on the eyes.
Speaker 1: And what is your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: My favorite vacation destination frankly is Miami, Florida.  We have a home there as well and I spend a lot of time there in the off-season, meaning that off-season in Chicago [Illinois] which is cold here, the season starts there in the end of the November and runs 'til May, so I'm in and out of the city all the time to enjoy that great weather.  As well as the facilities and the activities in that area.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Which is?
Speaker 2: It's not easy (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.  I like that.  And we'll talk about that a little later (laughter).
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Story_ID: 444327
Speaker 1: Where were you born?
Speaker 2: I was born in a small town in central Mississippi called Winona.  They call it the hills and roughly a 150 miles north of Jackson, Mississippi, I think that people who know the state would always know the capital so I associate the distance as far as people really being able to locate that area.
Speaker 1: We wanna talk a little bit about your, your family background.  So I'd like to just talk a little bit about your mother.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Corene Dodd [Corene Houston Dodd], C-O-R-E-N-E, Dodd that's D-O-D-D.
Speaker 1: And she was from?
Speaker 2: She was from the same town, Winona, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: And what, what was the year of her birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth was September 10th, 1929.
Speaker 1: And did she always live in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: No.  She frankly came to Chicago [Illinois] in the early '50s [1950s].  What happened there and then is that there was a, the Great Migration of blacks to the North for opportunities.  And my dad [Willie Dodd] died when I was five years of age and she moved to Chicago to look for better opportunity.  And consequently stayed here until she died.
Speaker 1: When she was, excuse me, in Mississippi, did she tell you much about her background, her mother, did you know her mother?
Speaker 2: In fact (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And her, your, your grandparents?
Speaker 2: --we have a very close-knit family.  My grandparents lived next door to us in Mississippi.  Upon my dad's death and my mother coming to Chicago, I frankly spent a number of years with my grandparents until which time they died.  When they died I had to come to Chicago and rejoin my mother here.  But during those times her being here and her kids being in Mississippi she would visit as often as she could.
Speaker 1: So as a little boy you were, your first early years were in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And during that time you were living with your mom?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And your grandparents lived--
Speaker 2: Next door.
Speaker 1: Next door.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And what were their names?
Speaker 2: Houston, my grandmother's name was Roxie Houston, and my grandfather's name was Louis Price Houston [Louis Houston] and I'm named after him.
Speaker 1: And do you know much about your mother's early life, where she went to school?
Speaker 2: I don't know a lot about the early life of her having gone to school but certainly there was one school in that small town which frankly was a grammar school and a high school for blacks.  And at that time certainly segregation was a big part of that community.  So the blacks attended one school, the whites attended another school.  And certainly she graduated from high school in that small town--
Story_ID: 444328
Speaker 1: Did your [maternal] grandparents [Roxie Houston and Louis Houston] ever talk to you much about their early years?
Speaker 2: Yes.  They, they certainly, they certainly did (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Would you share some of that with us?
Speaker 2: My grandfather was a minister and a pillar of the community.  In fact, they named a street after him once he died.  But he was a minister as well as a farmer.
Speaker 1: Now when you say he was a minister what denomination, do you remember the name of the church?
Speaker 2: A, a Baptist minister.  And the name of the church was Pleasant Valley Baptist Church [ph.] in the town of Winona, Mississippi, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And so continue, he was--
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: --also a farmer?
Speaker 2: Yes.  That was frankly the background by which my first exposure of being an entrepreneur.  He raised all kinds of food.  And in that area the idea of being able to raise all kinds of food and to sell in the markets, it provided the financing for a style of life that was slightly above the norm.  He also was a carpenter.  My first exposure of a person being able to build a house, single-handedly was to watch him do that as a child.  Even though very young I spent a lot of time with him.  He would take me around and would talk to me and had a great influence in terms of how I, I see life today.
Speaker 1: How do you remember the community then as a little boy?
Speaker 2: Well, very segregated community.  From what I understand and do recall there was a black area by which you had to stay in, a white area that you could not go in to, a downtown area about which you had to be very careful as to how you handle yourself.  And out of scuttlebutt having talked to my siblings, a situation by which if you would go to the movie, the whites would be downstairs and the blacks would be upstairs and you'd go in different doors.  So that was all part of that society.
Speaker 1: Can you talk to us a little bit about your grandmother?
Speaker 2: My grandmother was a housewife but a very attentive and creative person.  And one of which had a great influence on my life as well.  A person that would always encourage me to do well and for some reason would always tell me how smart I was and I, and I knew I wasn't in, in later life but just the fact of her encouraging as well as rewarding any accomplishment be it tiny or be it big, it really left an impression on me to really strive to do well in life.
Story_ID: 444329
Speaker 1: When you were describing the, the rules and regulations of the community [in Winona, Mississippi] being in, in that, in the South, did they ever say, did your [maternal] grandparents [Roxie Houston and Louis Houston] ever caution you?  Did they give you advice or, or caution you about where you shouldn't go, what the repercussions could have been if you had gone into a white community or wandered into some place where you shouldn't have?
Speaker 2: At, at that age I would primarily listen to my, listen to my grandparents talk to my siblings.  And they would be the recipients of that type of exposure but certainly that was a tradition.  But keep in mind unlike today and having been in that situation, you traditionally knew what to do and not to do.  At that time you did not buck the system and knew where you need to be and what you, you, you did not need to be and what to do and what not to do.  Certainly there were times by which that would be discussed but traditionally you knew the ground rules and you knew how to stay safe in a community and to survive.
Speaker 1: Now, did your grandparents talk about their parents at all and (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Ironically, yes.  My grandmother was a, a, a very tiny lady, roughly five feet and half Indian [Native American], her parents were Indians from the southern part of the state.  My grandfather did not talk a lot about his side of the family but certainly a person who was small in stature but also was reared in the southern part of the state.  Did not, to my recall, mention a lot about his family.
Speaker 1: Did you ever meet any of your, your great-grandparents on your grandmother's side?
Speaker 2: No, not at all.  I only can recall the conversations as I so described but they were all dead at that time.
Speaker 1: And you said that she was of Indian descent?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what about your grandfather?
Speaker 2: He had the Negroid parents and that was his side.
Story_ID: 444330
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Corene Houston Dodd] talk much about her, her early years and growing up in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: She did not.  I don't recall that but again I'm sure she did to my siblings.  Keep in mind the age difference between me and the next youngest sibling was really ten years.  I, I guess, I'm a, a, a lucky person to be here.
Speaker 1: So I wanted to talk about your, your siblings in another segment but--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --how many brothers and sisters do you have?
Speaker 2: Well, I have two sisters, my brother died roughly eight years ago.
Speaker 1: And you, can you give us their names and their birth dates?
Speaker 2: Pardon me, repeat that again?
Speaker 1: Can you give us your brother and sisters' names?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: And the year of their birth?
Speaker 2: My sister, the oldest, her name is Alice Doris Battle [Alice Dodd Battle].  The date of birth I have to look on that profile for her, I've listed it already.  My, the next in line in terms of sibling, his name was William Lee Dodd [William Dodd].  And the youngest is Annie Catherine Gaston [Annie Dodd Gaston (ph.)].  And those two persons as well I will, it's listed on their profile--
Speaker 1: So there were four?
Speaker 2: --the, the date of birth.  There were four total.
Speaker 1: Four.  And you are--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the?
Speaker 2: I'm the fourth.
Speaker 1: You're the youngest.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So there's a difference in your age, how many years is the difference between you and the oldest child?
Speaker 2: Roughly sixteen years.
Speaker 1: I wanna talk a little bit more about your, your mom's side of the family.  Did she have other brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My mother had one sister and one brother.  We have a very small family.
Speaker 1: And did you know them?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And are they still living?
Speaker 2: No, they are all deceased at this time.
Story_ID: 444331
Speaker 1: And moving on to your father, what was his name?
Speaker 2: Willie Lee Dodd [Willie Dodd] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Dodd.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And he was born where?
Speaker 2: In Mississippi as well.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: In the same town.
Speaker 1: --and what do you know about his background and his growing up?
Speaker 2: Very little in that there was discussions about him.  He was an entrepreneurial person.  Worked as a shoemaker there and certainly came to Chicago [Illinois] with my mother [Corene Houston Dodd].  And from what I understand worked in Gary [Indiana] as a shoemaker as well.  As well as in the steel mills.  Much of that migration, the opportunities were, particularly for men, was to work in steel mills.
Speaker 1: How would you describe your father?
Speaker 2: Well, vaguely from what I remember an entrepreneurial person but because of the overall exposures of men at that time coming from an area of poverty and also discrimination he turned out to be an alcoholic and he died of cirrhosis.
Speaker 1: And that was in what year?
Speaker 2: I don't know the exact year but that's listed also on that profile.
Story_ID: 444332
Speaker 1: Your [maternal] grandparents [Roxie Houston and Louis Houston], did they share any stories with your mother [Corene Houston Dodd] that she may have shared with you about their early years, about their growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  One of which I can recall, my dad [Willie Dodd] was a only child and from what I understood he was really reared by his grandparents.  And on, on a correlated basis compared to the community they had more money than most of the people there [Winona, Mississippi] and he was one of the first persons to own a car in that area and that was very, a big accomplishment--
Speaker 1: Oh, sure.
Speaker 2: --and they, they, they, they shared a lot of fun from the standpoint of going throughout the community driving and displaying that, that type of accomplishment.  And certainly when you are in that position you, you certainly are popular.  And by the same token, it's a situation to that can be detrimental as well and that may have led to, you know, his situation of, in terms of why he died.
Speaker 1: Did, do you remember what kind of car that was?
Speaker 2: From what I understand it was a, a Chevy [Chevrolet].  In fact, I've seen pictures of it in terms of them standing next to it and taking a picture and smiling about it.
Speaker 1: What year Chevy?
Speaker 2: That I don't know.  It, it, it, it, if you look at it you can tell that it was one that's certainly an antique that you would not see around anymore, um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  All right.  You're (unclear).
Speaker 2: So that car would definitely be a very special car to have right now (laughter)?
Speaker 1: There is no doubt about it.  In fact, worth a lot of money if in fact it could be kept in a condition that particularly would be usable, you know.
Speaker 2: Were there any other things that you remember or stories that they may have told you about those early days in Mississippi?
Speaker 1: No.  Being, being of that age and also the time having passed, you know, you, you, you tend to lose a lot of things.
Story_ID: 444333
Speaker 1: What was your household like in Mississippi then at that time?
Speaker 2: Very jovial, very clean, very big correlatively speaking to the neighborhood [in Winona, Mississippi].  Again the background of my [maternal] grandparents [Roxie Houston and Louis Houston] and, and I'm, I'm making mention of this because this is where I spent the greatest amount of time in terms of my recall, frankly the house was white, all wood, a lot of rooms, a lot of space, and a lot of land.  My grandfather was a landowner there and owned a lot of land by which he farmed.  The big thing about that overall exposure was that the food that we ate literally was all grown by him in terms of that process.  In other words, he would sell corn, would raise chickens, would raise hogs, would raise, would have areas by which fruit would grow, and these things would be preserved.  And over the wintertime you would be able to eat from the harvest that would generally take place in the fall.  And when the summers come you go back through that same routine of developing and, and raising those crops and, and putting them on the market.
Story_ID: 444334
Speaker 1: You said that he [Dodd's maternal grandfather, Louis Houston] also was a, a Baptist pastor?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about his church [Pleasant Valley Baptist Church (ph.), Winona, Mississippi], as much as you recall.
Speaker 2: Very small church, probably 200 to 300 people but one by which closely knit and the big thing that held families together particularly in that community was the church.  The times were so tough until that was the energy by which they gained their thought processes to continue on and to deal with the stresses of life.  So that being the case, the people would certainly have a very close-knit interaction in terms of what went on in the community and certainly there would be a lot of activities that is just centered around the church life, frankly, is centered around the church but with the emphasis on education, knowing that the salvation of, of getting out of that doldrum and the exposure of what they were going through, has to be education.  And whatever it took that's what you would always hear that you gotta get that done no matter what the cost.
Story_ID: 444335
Speaker 1: So your parents [Corene Houston Dodd and Willie Dodd] then, tell me about moving from Mississippi to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: There was a train called the Illinois Central [Illinois Central Railroad] and it ran through literally the, the center of the state.  And that was a train by which the migration to Chicago actually took place.  And I've heard stories that people had gone to the train station or to the bus station and inquired about what the cost would be to come to Chicago as well as there was a migration to New York [New York] and to Los Angeles [California] and check the cost of going to Los Angeles and to New York.  And the price itself determined where they would go.  It's cheaper to come to Chicago than any other place.  Because of that the communications of families were such that the opportunities in Chicago were such that if you come you could actually make it here.  And frankly when the families moved to Chicago you'd often stay with families, you did not have a place to stay in until you would be able to get a job.  And my family was no different.  And that was the scuttlebutt that I heard in terms of my mother and father, the idea that they would get on a train, have no inkling of what would be done here in terms of a job because there were no skill sets that certainly they could market.  There were perhaps some training that they had but not knowing that it could be used but the chance was that this was the place of opportunity and believing in that they came here and luckily they did get jobs.
Speaker 1: So your grandparents [Roxie Houston and Louis Houston] stayed in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And your mother and father packed the kids--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and came to Chicago?
Speaker 2: That is, that is correct.  But when my dad died then the kids went back to Mississippi because the times were so hard in terms of my mother trying to raise four kids and working, and we stayed with her until both grandparents died.
Speaker 1: Now when, when you came to Chicago what year was that?
Speaker 2: Wow.  The early '50s [1950s], I don't recall the exact year.  And the reason for that we went back and forth, it was not a permanence in the beginning.  We would go back and forth just depending upon what the dynamics of, of the economic conditions.
Speaker 1: When you came you stayed with relatives though?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And who were they and do you remember where they lived?
Speaker 2: My mother's sister and her husband they stayed, 4541 Vincennes [Avenue] of all places, and occupied the total floor.  There were really two bedrooms there but the issue is that the family had to stay in one bedroom and that was, that was very tough.
Speaker 1: Now what were their names?
Speaker 2: My--
Speaker 1: Your aunt and uncle?
Speaker 2: My aunt and uncle?  My aunt's name was Callie Mae Freeman [Callie Mae Houston Freeman] and my uncle's name was Paul Freeman [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And they had been here how long?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: My aunt was the oldest in her family.  My mother had one other brother.  They had been in Chicago roughly four to five years before my mother made the, the trip.
Speaker 1: What was her other brother's name?
Speaker 2: My mother's?
Speaker 1: Your uncle?
Speaker 2: My--
Speaker 1: Your, your mother had--
Speaker 2: John, John Houston.
Speaker 1: So there were three of them?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: John Houston.
Speaker 1: So when you came to Chicago you stayed at 4541 Vincennes--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --for a while before you went back again?
Speaker 2: Right.  In other words, I would go back and forth depending upon the economic conditions.  And the economic conditions were tough.  And, and that was just what was going on.
Story_ID: 444336
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about your first remembrances of Chicago [Illinois] when you first, your first time here, and how you felt about leaving Mississippi coming here?
Speaker 2: Very strange, very confusing.  I, I guess the, the, the big thought if, if I could relate back that far was bright lights and big city and certainly that's intimidating, not having had that exposure before.  And a reluctance to even venture from the overall address to where you live because it, it, it, it, it was just totally different.
Speaker 1: And do you recall how your siblings felt about leaving Mississippi coming here?
Speaker 2: My interpretation of their feeling was because they were older, they were happy in the sense that it would be a different place, certainly their ages were such to that undoubtedly they had been told that this is a place of greater opportunity, getting away from segregation by which they knew the rules and would not be confronted to the same degree that they had been in that area was such that it undoubtedly provided a relief.
Story_ID: 444337
Speaker 1: Now when your mom [Corene Houston Dodd] and dad [Willie Dodd] first came that, like the first trip, what type of work was she able to do?  What did she do?
Speaker 2: Well, they called it day work, whatever you could find.  And it was a point of survival.  She ended up being a, a dietician as a result of going to school and training.  She worked at the Shoreland Hotel which is in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois] until which time her health impacted her in such a way that she could not work in that arena.  She did go into business, she owned a dry cleaners and, and, in the area that we lived in.  Owned a restaurant in the area that we lived in and that's part of the entrepreneurial spirit that came undoubtedly from my grandparents [Roxie Houston and Louis Houston].
Story_ID: 444338
Speaker 1: You were telling me that your mother [Corene Houston Dodd] eventually had her own business but the very first, and she had several jobs with the Shoreland [Shoreland Hotel, Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --but when you first came that very first time, your first trip to Chicago [Illinois], what did she do then when you were living at 4541 Vincennes [Avenue], and what was your dad [Willie Dodd] doing?
Speaker 2: The work that she did then they call it day work or maid's work, whatever you could find.  My dad worked at the steel mill exceptionally.  And he was a person who for all intents and purposes he was a great person from the standpoint of, of, of his family but he, he, he didn't spend a lot of time with the family.  He was always in the street.  But I, I, I indicated to you before he was an alcoholic and that's certainly part of it in terms of undoubtedly why, you know, the frustrations of, of the time, not making any excuses for him but there has always been a strain and I can empathize at the time of what black men were going through that it strained and embarrassed to a degree in the sense that can you provide for your family.  The other things that's going on in your life, the history of how you lived.  And again, him having grown up in a community [in Winona, Mississippi] whereby he was above the norm as far as his family in the South but comes here and he's no longer that way, that's a degree of frustration as well.  But again he spent a lot of time away from home, not a lot of time with the kids.  And, and as an end result, it was difficult to really tie in to a history of, of positive or negative situations that ties with him as an individual, particularly at the age that I was at that time.
Speaker 1: Did he want to come to Chicago?
Speaker 2: To my knowledge, yes.  I understood from having conversed with people that this was the area of opportunity.  And keep in mind in a small town of which I described, there was no opportunity other than what menial jobs you could come up with.  My grandfather [Louis Houston] was an unusual person in that his skillsets somewhat suited that community and kept him busy and by the same token provided a lifestyle by which he was not dependent upon other people but dependent upon his skillsets and could take care of his family.  But anyone who did not have that type of background certainly would need to look for an opportunity by which they could at least make a living.
Story_ID: 444339
Speaker 1: When you came to live with your [maternal] aunt [Callie Mae Houston Freeman] here, what were your brothers and sisters doing?  Did they enroll in school?  Where did you go to school during that period?
Speaker 2: They did enroll in, in, in school, when I was here, when I came here.  In fact, they were all in high school at the time.  And all went to Phillips High School [Wendell Phillips High School; Wendell Phillips Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  At that time to my knowledge there were literally a few schools that blacks really attended, Phillips and Dunbar [Dunbar Vocational High School; Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] and Englewood [Englewood High School, Chicago, Illinois] those were the schools of popularity among black folks.  Other than that integration was a situation.
Speaker 1: And you were in elementary school--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so what school did you attend?
Speaker 2: Burke Elementary School [Edmund Burke Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: And where was that located?
Speaker 2: 54th [Street] and King Drive [South Parkway; Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And can you tell us a little bit about those early years at Burke?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Coming from the South--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you were a little southern boy coming to Chicago [Illinois].  What was that like?
Speaker 2: Well, somewhat intimidating not having been in a facility of that size or around as many people as the school provided.  Also at a point by which the, the kids were different.  Being in the North they, they tended to not be as disciplined as the people from the South, simply out of background and out of family structure.  But took a while to get acclimated to it but did compete and did well throughout and that was always something family-wise that was stressed is that no matter what endeavor you involve yourself you had to excel.
Speaker 1: You mentioned that you again went back to Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Do you remember how old you were at that time?
Speaker 2: The last time that I went back, I'm recalling the time sequence, it was when I was in eighth grade because when I, I left and came back I went to high school, immediately upon, immediately after coming back.  So undoubtedly it was between seventh and eighth grade.
Speaker 1: So you, when you came you were about five years old?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you stayed until eighth grade?
Speaker 2: Right, and then went back.
Speaker 1: And then went back--
Speaker 2: Right, and then come back.
Speaker 1: And so by then your brothers and sisters had graduated?
Speaker 2: That is, that is true.
Speaker 1: And what were they doing?
Speaker 2: My brothers and sisters really after having left high school took jobs except my older sister [Alice Dodd Battle], she did go back to college in Mississippi, a small school called Mississippi Valley State [Mississippi Vocational College; Mississippi Valley State University, Itta Bena, Mississippi].  And she attended that school for three years and did not graduate.  I'm the first in my family to have graduated from college.
Story_ID: 444340
Speaker 1: So during that, during that period before going back to Mississippi, your father [Willie Dodd] passed?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And what was that like for the family?
Speaker 2: Very devastating even though he was gone a lot, it, it disturbed the overall family tree and created a lot of lack of organization and created a situation by which we had to regroup.

Speaker 1: How long did you stay with your aunt [Callie Mae Houston Freeman] on Vincennes [Vincennes Avenue, Chicago, Illinois] before you, the family got their own place?  Because we're looking at a period of what about, eight, six, or seven years.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  You know, the family being so small and close-knit, we moved next door.  And--
Speaker 1: In the same building?
Speaker 2: In the same building, right.  The building was a three flat, we just moved next door, just took the next floor.  So that's just a coincidence but that's what happened.
Speaker 1: And you, and you lived there at 4541 Vincennes--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --until you went back to Mississippi again?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And that was just you and your mom [Corene Houston Dodd]?
Speaker 2: My mom and my siblings, my older, not the older, but the, the two siblings, my sister [Annie Dodd Gaston (ph.)] and my brother [William Dodd].  And they had jobs, of course.
Speaker 1: So what was the condition of that move?
Speaker 2: You mean to go--
Speaker 1: Why, why did she decide to go back again?
Speaker 2: Well, she didn't go back, she sent us back.
Speaker 1: Oh, she sent you back?
Speaker 2: Sent me back, uh-huh, right, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: The economic condition and also the environment.
Speaker 1: Tell me about, a little bit about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Primarily but I'm, I'm thinking primarily the economic condition because the way the family was raised, we knew not to get in trouble.  But the economic conditions were undoubtedly such that and because of the pride that she has, or had rather, she would not discuss that type of thing, not openly but I'm interpreting the situation, so to provide in a better condition than she could provide it would be economically more feasible to, to send me back.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what year that was?
Speaker 2: I don't remember the year but again I was in seventh or eighth grade because I was there two years and my, it had to be seventh grade because I was there two years and, and my grandparents [Roxie Houston and Louis Houston] died then they had to bring me here.
Speaker 1: So when you went back to Mississippi you lived with your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 444342
Speaker 1: And you went back to school there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: And where did you attend school?
Speaker 2: A, a school called Winona High School [Winona Secondary School, Winona, Mississippi] but it was all grades.  The, the, the school's name was Winona High School but it had one through twelve, grades one through twelve.
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about going from the Chicago [Illinois] schools back to the Mississippi schools (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I found that it was somewhat of a relief in the sense of not dealing with as many peers in a classroom.  It appeared that the teachers, though it was the South, had a greater relationship with the kids and in my personal opinion, a lot more was done from the standpoint of teaching and learning was done in, in, in Mississippi than here.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the teachers that you would say in Mississippi that had a, made a great impression on you?
Speaker 2: There was one in particular, his name was James Winbush [ph.].  Frankly in my opinion, even to this day, certainly one of the smartest persons that I've ever been around.  A person by which could play all instruments and self-taught.  A person who could read a book and you tell him the page, he can tell you what was in it.  A person who would tell you to open the Bible and you would read a passage, he'll tell you, identify what book and, and just tell--
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: --you all about it.  A person by which encouraged me to do well, to take part in sports, to be a good citizen.  And a person that you just could never forget.
Speaker 1: And he was your eighth grade, seventh and eighth grade teacher?
Speaker 2: Frankly he was the principal of the high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  So just a remarkable person.
Speaker 1: When you graduated from school in Mississippi, you came back to Chicago?
Speaker 2: Well, not graduated there, I came back to Chicago and started in high school [Dunbar Vocational High School; Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  They didn't have an, a eighth grade graduation as they do here.  You, you'd graduate from high school there.  But when I came back I came back and, and was in the position to go to high school.
Story_ID: 444343
Speaker 1: When you were at Burke Elementary School [Edmund Burke Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] did you make a lot of friends and do you remember any of those people that you--
Speaker 2: I've never been a person who was very social from the standpoint of popularity.  I've always been a driven person to accomplish goals.  And certainly you'd have one or two friends that had a, a, a similar ideas as you and you migrate to them but that, that, that's been much my, my, my exposure in, in terms of how I've lived.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of your teachers at Burke that may have impressed you?
Speaker 2: No, not at all.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Not correlatively speaking to anything outstanding.
Story_ID: 444344
Speaker 1: So you came back to Chicago [Illinois] and you attended which school?
Speaker 2: Dunbar High School [Dunbar Vocational High School; Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: And what was that like?
Speaker 2: A big adjustment.  Dunbar at the time that I attended had three thousand students and has changed since.  And when I graduated my class was like eight hundred students, so it was a huge class.  And a place by which, you know, a lot of things went on and so many people until, you, you know, you, you'd only know a few.  A, a, a situation that certainly was somewhat intimidating because having come from a small place [Winona High School; Winona Secondary School, Winona, Mississippi] and going to something of that magnitude you, you tend to certainly not feel comfortable.  But my attitude is always or has always been to mix well, to have a good reputation, and to matriculate through whatever is necessary.
Speaker 1: That was 19, well '59 [1959]--
Speaker 2: Roughly so, roughly so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) when you went to Dunbar.
Speaker 2: Roughly so.
Speaker 1: And you were how old when you started?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: How old were you when you started at Dunbar?
Speaker 2: Wow.  I think 16, 15 or 16.
Speaker 1: And you graduated valedictorian?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: Well, that was certainly a, a challenge.  I say that because during the four years that I was there I, I also worked literally full-time because of the family's condition.  So meaning that I certainly wanted to be independent and not having to depend on my mother [Corene Houston Dodd], so I worked at a place called Montgomery Wards [Montgomery Ward] after school and on the weekends which did not give me a lot of time to do other things but that was just part of what went on at the time.
Speaker 1: And you were fifteen?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did you have to have a work permit?  Wasn't that during the time when you--
Speaker 2: Truthfully not (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) how did that work?
Speaker 2: --truthfully not.  At that time, they would, they would take you.  And certainly I have always been big for my size from the standpoint of stature and probably looked a lot older than I really was.  And they took me and certainly I was working with men who had been around twenty and thirty years.  We worked on the docks.  And it was cold in the wintertime, hot in the summer but certainly a discipline by which if you did have any ideas of not doing well in life that would enhance that--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --that thought process.
Story_ID: 444345
Speaker 1: So your mother [Corene Houston Dodd] was doing what at the time?
Speaker 2: At that time she was working at the Shoreland Hotel [Chicago, Illinois] and she was working as a dietician.  She worked in the banquet area.
Speaker 1: How did she, she had, when we left off she was working as a day worker.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So how did she get the skill to be a dietician?
Speaker 2: She went to school (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) She went to school.
Speaker 2: She went to school.
Speaker 1: Was that during the time you all were in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Right.  In other words she worked and went to school simultaneously.
Speaker 1: And the other brothers and sisters did they come back to Chicago [Illinois] when you came back?
Speaker 2: Well, the, in that age of disparity they stayed here.  I was the one that was shipped back.  And I guess the vulnerability of not being at an age by which you could easily not run into trouble, it was just safer to do that.
Story_ID: 444346
Speaker 1: What was the city like then?  What was going on during that time that--
Speaker 2: The big thing that I could remember is that they had jitneys on King Drive [Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive], they called it South Parkway then, and I would take a, a jitney to Dunbar [Dunbar Vocational High School; Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  The big thing is that everybody clamored to get in the big cars that they had and certainly I think it cost ten or fifteen cents to ride a jitney.  No one really wanted to ride the bus.  The activities of the time was (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, the jitney was the, the taxi--
Speaker 2: Taxi, right.
Speaker 1: --that went north--
Speaker 2: From--
Speaker 1: -and south on King Drive?
Speaker 2: North and south on King Drive to, from 30th Street all the way to 63rd Street.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: For ten cents?
Speaker 2: For ten cents right, uh-huh.  So we would walk over to South Parkway, take the jitney to school.  That was the big thing because no one really wanted to ride the bus anyway, that was a big time thing.  The other thing is that we had the luxury of the Regal Theater [Chicago, Illinois], anybody who was in the entertainment business always would come there and you could see shows over and over again at one price.  So that was a primary source of entertainment, uh-huh.  I've always been a person who was active in sports so I, I also spent my time doing that as well.
Story_ID: 444347
Speaker 1: The community that you lived in was pretty much an African American--
Speaker 2: All African American.
Speaker 1: All African American--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --community.  Do you remember any of the neighbors?  Do you remember anything special about growing up on 45th [Street] and Vincennes [Avenue]?  The sights of the city [Chicago, Illinois] or the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Well, the answer is yes.  There was a gentleman who lived in the building, it was a three flat building, who took time out for me.  And I'm trying to, his name was Burns [ph.].  He felt that out of my work ethic and having observed that he taught me to drive.  He encouraged me to do well.  In fact, wanted me to join the police department and certainly that was not a, an option on my part.  Tried to encourage me to enroll in the Air Force Academy [United States Air Force Academy, Colorado] which certainly was an interest that I had at the time, but didn't pursue.  He was a somewhat of a butler for a rich person in Hinsdale [Illinois].  And having talked to his boss had made an arrangement for me to go to John Hopkins in, in Maryland [Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland] after having gotten out of high school  but me not knowing and not having any guidance in terms of, of what those opportunities were, I passed over that.  But just a, a wonderful guy who was self-taught, really little or no education but certainly worked hard and was thought of very well with the person that he worked for.  The other things in the neighborhood was such, were, were such that everything took place within a matter of blocks, you know, the exposures of festivals and that kind of thing.  The--
Speaker 1: When you say festivals, can you tell us a little bit about what type of festivals?
Speaker 2: Well, you just look at the local neighborhood type of thing.  The big thing certainly would, say the Bud Billiken Parade.  But they also had little neighborhood promotions that would be entertainment.  You know, the local businessmen would put on and the kids would gather around and, and just have fun.  But the idea would be that, you know, you, you'd look at a, a, a neighborhood by which at least you get to know your neighbors.  And I think that that was primarily the idea as to why they did that type of thing was to bring a, a neighborhood together and to interact the people whereby at least you know who they were.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of your other neighbors in the community or young people around your age that you may have (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you always had had a, a best friend, and I, I did have that and certainly he went to Dunbar [Dunbar Vocational High School; Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] with me.  His name was Willie Clark [ph.] and coincidentally his mother's name was Lorene [Lorene Clark (ph.)] and my mother's name was Corene [Corene Houston Dodd].  And we were somewhat competitive in, in the things that we did and spent a lot of time together.  He ended up going to the [U.S.] Air Force and turned out to be a doctor.  In fact, after I had become an adult and had gotten out of college [Chicago Teachers College; Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois] he looked me up just to let me know he was a doctor so--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --that just lets, you know, the competition that really went on as far as accomplishments are concerned.
Speaker 1: Are you still in contact with him?
Speaker 2: No.  The last I heard of him he was in southern Illinois working in a small community (background noise) but I have not heard from him.
Story_ID: 444348
Speaker 1: Who were some of the teachers at Dunbar [Dunbar Vocational High School; Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] that may have had an impact on you academically or as far as achieving some of the goals that you have, that made an impression on you, were there any?
Speaker 2: The greatest impact that I had having been at Dunbar was really a counselor, and I'm trying to think of his name.  In fact, I really don't want, I wouldn't wanna mention his name for the mere fact of what I'm about to tell you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was the valedictorian of my class and he discouraged me from going to college.  And what that really did was to encourage me to go.  He told me that I would be back on the street as the rest of the kids in a few months, just standing around and wondering what to do and, and with my background that that really challenged me more than anything else.  And with that in mind, it really turned out to be a plus as opposed to a negative.  Certainly a, a lesser person probably would have taken that and believed in it but I saw positives out of a negative in terms of how it was presented.
Speaker 1: Was this an African American teacher?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What was the, were most of the teachers at the school African American during that time?
Speaker 2: Most were, most were--
Speaker 1: 'Cause that was--
Speaker 2: --at that time.   There were a few sprinklings of Caucasian and occasional Hispanic person but primarily Afro, Afro American.  And the population of the school was primarily Afro American as well (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Story_ID: 444349
Speaker 1: What was your favorite subject [at Dunbar Vocational High School; Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois]?  Did you have any?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I've always excelled in, in several areas, science and math and, and frankly history.  Those are, are the areas of, of, of which I, I find of importance.  Particularly in history in the sense that you learn in terms of what you don't wanna do and you use that to propel you to the future.
Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself as a student?
Speaker 2: I've always been a good student, very aggressive and certainly that is a trait by which I know came from my [maternal] grandparents [Roxie Houston and Louis Houston].  They always created an atmosphere by which they would tell me how smart I was and in hindsight I know I wasn't but the issue was that that created a, a sense to let me know that I could accomplish something and they were proud of it.  And they always made a big thing out of nothing.  Meaning that the smallest little trait of accomplishment had to be rewarded in the sense of acknowledgement.  And that has been a trait that I have used even on my kids because every person needs to know that they're worthy and that they can accomplish and it creates a self-esteem that nobody can destroy.
Speaker 1: You mentioned earlier that you liked or were involved in athletics?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us a little bit about what you did?
Speaker 2: Well, even with all of the activities that I have been involved in, not having the money to go to college, I did and was lucky to get a scholarship to the University of Nebraska [University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, Nebraska] just in football.  And really not having played a lot of games but I've always been athletically inclined and always have had the body for it.  And did go there for one year but got injured and had to quit and came back to Chicago [Illinois] and I finished school [Chicago Teachers College; Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois] here.
Story_ID: 444350
Speaker 1: --I want to talk about those high school years--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --a little bit when you, after you, you graduated in 19--what from high school [Dunbar Vocational High School; Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: In '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: In 1963.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you were telling me that you had gotten a scholarship for athletics?
Speaker 2: Yes, in fact, it was somewhat of a, I guess, what the colloquial, colloquialism would be a humbug.  Having been told that I was not college material and also having been told that I would be back on the street and knowing that I was valedictorian of my class and that there were like eight hundred students who were in my class, I started to look at the opportunities of the colleges around and with just exploring them on my own not having any guidance by anybody, then university of, University of Nebraska [University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, Nebraska] gave me the opportunity to come out, they call it rush week, and that's the time by which you go out and you look at the sororities and the fraternities and having gone there I met a couple of the football players and had a, a trial to see if I could make the team and, and did.  So (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, had you played sports before?  Had you played football before?
Speaker 2: Well, I had but on a sandlot type basis.  I've always been athletically inclined, inclined but the issue in terms of why I had not put a lot of time in is because I worked during the time that those practices took place.
Speaker 1: So in high school you weren't actively, were you actively involved in any sports?
Speaker 2: Yes and no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me a little bit about that.
Speaker 2: Meaning when I say yes and no that that meant that any opportunity that I got and that I didn't have to work, I'm out there with the guys and not on an organized basis whereby I would actually play in the games but any time that I have and not having to go to work, I'm spending time there.
Speaker 1: And that was football, basketball, or what?
Speaker 2: Football.
Speaker 1: Football.
Speaker 2: And baseball.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So you worked during high school--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --at Montgomery Ward?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: As a shipping clerk?
Speaker 2: Well--that evolved there exceptionally you just worked on the docks.  You, you actually had to qualify as a shipping clerk because that, in that area was the apex of the better jobs but you started just unloading the train cars and trucks and you migrated and learned to be promoted to that area.
Speaker 1: What was your salary there?
Speaker 2: Frankly I started at a $1.08 an hour and that was a lot of money.
Speaker 1: And you worked about how many hours a week?
Speaker 2: Anywhere from forty to sixty.
Speaker 1: And attended school full-time?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And you were helping out at home?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So was it just you and your mom [Corene Houston Dodd]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Just the two of you?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And any time that you had in between then you would be involved in sports?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 444351
Speaker 1: So take me back to how you happened to find out about the university, when you went to the University of Idaho--
Speaker 2: No, University of Nebraska [University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, Nebraska].
Speaker 1: Nebraska.
Speaker 2: Right.  That was just a point of me having been motivated by the counselor [at Dunbar Vocational High School; Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] that I was not college material to examine on my own to see who would, you know, allow me to attend.  And having written letters this was the first letter to come back.
Speaker 1: Where were some of the other schools you applied, do you remember?
Speaker 2: Frankly I applied to probably twenty universities.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Just, I know as a kid you just throw things out.  And the first one that came back is the one that I took.  So that that was the way it was.
Speaker 1: And they offered you a scholarship?
Speaker 2: After having gone to rush week that's the week that you go and you get acquainted with the fraternities and that type thing.  And, and at that time, this is before the regular students come, the football players were there and I made friends with several of them and they asked me to try out for the team and luckily I made it.
Speaker 1: And so tell me about your experience at this university?
Speaker 2: Quite an experience.  At that time the only blacks at the school were the athletes, the football players.  And that was a close-knit group because they shared a lot in common.  But certainly a strange place in the sense that it's out in the middle of nowhere in Lincoln, Nebraska.  But certainly an opportunity of exposure by which it makes for a better person and that you do get to see and do have a chance to compete with the, the other groups in life, meaning, you know, the whites and the Hispanics.  There were a few Hispanics there as well but primarily white.
Speaker 1: How did your mother [Corene Houston Dodd] feel about you going away--it's been the two of you, what was that separation (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--
Speaker 1: --like?
Speaker 2: --she's always been protective and that I was the baby but the other thing that I think she realized is that no matter what happens, you still have to think of what is best for that person and that at some point in life they have to venture out on their own.  And certainly that has always been her attitude.
Speaker 1: So you, tell, you stayed at the university for how long?
Speaker 2: One year.  I, I got injured and at that time in, it's very much the same way today.  Athletes are such that if you can't play anymore you don't, you have no scholarship.
Story_ID: 444352
Speaker 1: And so when you left [University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, Nebraska] you came back to Chicago [Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and what did you--?
Speaker 2: I came back to Chicago and went to Chicago Teachers College [Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois].  At that time Chicago Teachers College and Wilson Junior College [Woodrow Wilson Junior College; Kennedy-King College, Chicago, Illinois] was the same.  I also went back to work and on the docks again [for Montgomery Ward], that was just for the physical enhancement of, of being able to get an exercise and get paid for it.  The irony of Chicago Teachers College and I found there and a lot of folks don't know about it in that the Wilson Junior College and Chicago Teachers College shared the same building but Chicago Teachers College was like 90 percent white and Wilson Junior College was like 95 percent black, so we would all gather in the cafeterias and, and general areas but when you go to class, whole different ball game.
Speaker 1: And you, what was it that made you go to Chicago Teachers College?  Did you have a desire to be a teacher or what were you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes--
Speaker 1: --looking at as a vocation.
Speaker 2: --yes and no.  At that time the Vietnam War was going on and everybody was clamoring to stay out of the war and the only way that you could avoid that, you had to be in school.  And the safe haven of going to school and not going because they would take you out of school as well, was to go to a teachers institution and the government felt that with that you would be more of a pillar of the community on a training basis and more valuable to, to the community than going to war.
Speaker 1: And so you went to Chicago Teachers College and you graduated in what year?
Speaker 2: Sixty--I think it was '65 [1965].
Speaker 1: Sixty-five [1965].
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 444353
Speaker 1: And after your graduation, tell me about your years after graduation [from Chicago Teachers College; Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Well, I taught school for five years.  In the meantime though with the entrepreneurial spirit I always had some business on the side.  We, a partner, well, two partners [Nolan Harrison and Forest Bailey] and I while teaching we developed what is called a rubber stamp company [Bailey's Stamp Works (ph.)] and those things are archaic and obsolete now but we used to make rubber stamps at night and teach during the day, and we had very big contracts.  We would, we had contracts with Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.], Wards [Montgomery Ward], Argonne National Laboratories [Argonne National Laboratory], University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], University of Illinois, just a ton of businesses.  And--
Speaker 1: Tell me about these--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --rubber stamps, these were like, paid stamps or--
Speaker 2: That, that, that is correct.  That is correct (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, how did you get that idea?
Speaker 2: Well, a friend of mine frankly had a background in printing.  And we all, and we worked at Wards together on the docks.  And from that we got together and started talking about going into business.  And frankly this was one of the first ventures in business on a success level that that I had.  And in doing so, it really catapulted us to do other things.  So we worked in, in his basement, he owned a building, so we would work at night after having taught all day making the rubber stamps and we'd teach during the daytime and that went on for like five years.
Speaker 1: Let me talk a little bit about your teaching career.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And then I'd like to go back to the rubber stamp--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --business, that's very interesting.
Story_ID: 444354
Speaker 1: But you left Chicago State--well, Chicago Teachers College [Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Chicago Teachers College then.
Speaker 1: And you went to the board of education [Chicago Board of Education]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --as a teacher.  Tell me what were you teaching?
Speaker 2: Language arts.
Speaker 1: And what school did you, were you assigned too?
Speaker 2: Forrestville High School [Chicago, Illinois].  Well, Forrestville Upper Grade Center at the time.  It later turned into Forrestville High School.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Did you find that Forrestville (unclear) and that there were certain schools that African Americans taught in at this time because now we're maybe around 1965?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Well, at that time, which certainly is a lot different from today, most teachers, at least 50 percent, were substitutes.  You had to be certified in order to be assigned to a school.  And in order to be certified you took an eight hour exam, you needed to pass that but that was not the issue of a problem.  After that you had to take an oral and the board of education used the oral exam to keep that 50 percent in tow.  And the issue--
Speaker 1: When you say the 50 percent in tow, you mean 50 percent--
Speaker 2: It was an economic situation--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --by which the substitute noncertified teachers would not get the same pay as the certified teachers or the tenure.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And which category were you in?
Speaker 2: Well, I started as a certified teacher.  I took the exam right away.  The issue though is that though you passed and many people passed the eight hour exam, could not pass, Afro Americans could not pass the oral.  And the oral was always done with white persons who would be on the oral exam board.  And they were very cognizant to be sure that you had what is called a Midwest dialect, that's the Indiana dialect at that time, that's what they were looking to.  And if you had a dialect other than that and meaning that a southern dialect or any other dialect, you would be unlikely to pass.
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: So it was a judgmental situation but it was an economic situation as well.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. What was that oral like?  Do you remember some of the things that they--
Speaker 2: Well, the fairness was that they did talk to you and question you about subject matter but it was always a situation by which the tone of voice that they made the conclusion on, not the facts of what information was attained.  Many people could deal with the situation of facts but many could not deal with the element of the tone, meaning that there was a prejudicial situation there.  And keeping in mind it was an economic situation with the board of education.  Meaning that if you had teachers who could not make top pay, could not get promoted, could not get tenure, then you have a budget that you could control.
Story_ID: 444355
Speaker 1: What was the situation during this time was, weren't they teaching children in wagons?
Speaker 2: Yes, they had what is called Willis Wagons.  And that was a irony as well.  The poorer communities never had the ability to really get the best teachers simply out of what I mentioned to you on the qualification of being certified.  But also the poorer communities had the greatest number of students because of the controlled economic situation that put blacks and poor people in certain areas so the schools were overcrowded.  So as a result of it being overcrowded and not having the physical classrooms then they had the mobile classrooms and they literally called them Willis Wagons as a result of the superintendent [Benjamin Willis] at the time made them available and they really populated the poorer communities.  So these were mobile homes so to speak that was converted to a classroom that was attached to the exterior of the school or surrounded the school.
Speaker 1: Did they have those at Forrestville [Forrestville Upper Grade Center, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: They had a few, not as many as many other places.  But keep in mind Forrestville was an upper grade center that was grades seven and eight.  And because of that though we did have a heavy population, we didn't have as many as other people.  Now, keep in mind Forrestville was also a complex.  We had the high school [Forrestville High School, Chicago, Illinois] next to us and we also had a elementary [Woodson North Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois] within the same block so we were surrounded with wagons but they were not necessarily attached to Forrestville but part of the elementary school primarily and also the high school.
Speaker 1: What was your opinion of that whole teaching situation?  Did you feel that students could learn in these Willis Wagons or I think there was quite an uproar among the teachers during that time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--
Speaker 1: --about them?
Speaker 2: --they, there certainly was a, a total uproar in terms of a mobile situation does not provide the physical elements that a classroom could.  And no one really wanted to be in that situation if you didn't have to.  My opinion of, of the teaching situation is such that that really depends on the talent of that individual and that individual's ability to get through to the students.  But to get through to the students in my opinion, you first have to get the respect of the students.  If you can't get the respect you cannot teach anybody and that has always been a, an issue with me and that I had to do that.  Those years by which I taught school and there were five years that I did, I called that my immediate contribution to society because certainly I recognized that I was underpaid but by the same token I realized too that I needed to donate that time and that effort and, and, and commitment to the community.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what the pay was for you at that time?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I remember that quite well.  Although I had a number of jobs at the time, the pay was $5200 a year.  And I just couldn't wait to get that job because the first thing I wanted to do was to do what I never did do at that time was to buy a Mercedes [Mercedes-Benz] but I, I remember that quite vividly.
Speaker 1: And that was $5200 a year for teachers that were--
Speaker 2: Certified (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) certified.
Speaker 2: Certified, certified.  And the teachers who were not certified would not get that amount.  I don't remember what the discrepancy was but it was much less.
Speaker 1: And benefits were attached to that?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you were a certified teacher (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Story_ID: 444356
Speaker 1: So during the time you were at, did you do all of your, your teaching career at Forrestville [Forrestville Upper Grade Center, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  When I left teaching, I was moving to the high school and I, I, I quit that same year.  They had built the high school [Martin Luther King, Jr. High School; Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. College Preparatory High School, Chicago, Illinois] on Drexel [Boulevard].
Speaker 1: Have you, or do you remember any of your students in particular that you may have made a very positive impact?
Speaker 2: Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And any of them ever come back to you many years later?
Speaker 2: --I've met them on the, I've met them on the street and then they've come to me.  Frankly, there were two types of students that they would actually assign me to deal with.  And, and what happens in the upper grade center you had the rotation of classes but the troubled students who no one could handle particularly the males, they would always send them to me because they had a disciplinary problem and an image problem undoubtedly because many undoubtedly came from broken homes and that type of thing.  But not having remembered the names but after I was, had stopped teaching, I, I just met a number of 'em on the street that would come up and, you know, introduce themselves and tell me who they were and, you know, and what high school, not high school, but when I, I taught them and that kind of thing and how we are doing and always pleased to let me know what they were doing.
Story_ID: 444357
Speaker 1: Now, this is a pretty exciting period, or a changing period in Chicago's [Chicago, Illinois] history during that time.  You had--
Speaker 2: The riots.
Speaker 1: --the riots.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Tell me what, what are your remembrances  of that and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--
Speaker 1: --if you had any involvement?
Speaker 2: The riots in '68 [1968] I remember vividly, I had just left the teaching situation, I had gone to Wards [Montgomery Ward] to work.  And they made that announcement of what was taking place and the streets were, particularly downtown were shut down.  The areas particularly on the immediate West Side were just being looted like you wouldn't believe and smoke and fire was everywhere and people were frightened and almost like panic throughout.  And, and that had really certainly been fueled a lot by the frustrations of the inequities at the time and a, a numb realization of society of what was brewing as far as people being held back and the issues of what was impending in their minds and in their bodies.
Speaker 1: Now, when you say the inequities can you elaborate a little on that?
Speaker 2: Well, keep in mind even at that time in Chicago there was still areas that you could not live in, Bridgeport [Chicago, Illinois] was one and you knew not to go over there and that was where the mayor [Richard J. Daley] lived.  There were other areas too by which you know you would not welcomed.  Keep in mind too that during the time that I graduated from high school [Dunbar Vocational High School; Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], it was only a few years before that that you could not have a prom in the Loop [Chicago, Illinois].  So those things were such that the disparities, the inequities, the prejudicial situations were such, were still perpetuated.
Speaker 1: Where was your prom?
Speaker 2: The prom that we had was on the North Side in a hotel that I, I, I can't recall but right on the lake [Lake Michigan].
Speaker 1: But it wasn't down, it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was not downtown.
Speaker 1: --it was in an acceptable area?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, on the Near North Side, right, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So I'm sorry go ahead.
Speaker 2: No.  But again, the riots were certainly a intimidating time and a time by which, you know, you recognized what was going on and you somewhat stayed close to home but the issue of the time though, I guess no one would ever condone that type of thing and certainly I wouldn't, but immediately afterwards there was change and you could see it.  Not that it was a, a thing by which one could say tremendous progress was made but change was in the process of being made.  In other words opportunities by Corporate America, you could see differences in terms of how they viewed the situation as far as opportunities were concerned and they were taking on minorities as a project to integrate the system.
Story_ID: 444358
Speaker 1: And a classic example was that when I left teaching and interviewed for the job at Allstate [Allstate Corporation], they were not hiring but part of the time of change certainly gave me and my partners the opportunity to go into Corporate America.  Now, again they weren't hiring but the strength of the three of us having the background of running a business [Bailey's Stamp Works (ph.)] and a provable background, they hired all three at the time but that was the impact indirectly of what those riots were all about.
Speaker 2: When you say you and your three friends, would you give me their names and--
Speaker 1: Nolan Harrison and Forest Bailey, two friends.
Speaker 2: Nolan Harrison--
Speaker 1: And Forest Bailey.
Speaker 2: And these were gentlemen that you were in business with, with stamps (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) With the rubber stamps, right.
Speaker 2: With the rubber.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And they were also teachers--
Speaker 1: Yes, both (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) with you?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: A little bit about the stamp business before we go into--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --Allstate.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: How did you manage to do the marketing and make this very successful while you were teaching and making stamps?
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: Tell us a little bit about that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) the blessing about teaching is that and frankly even today I think it's one of the better jobs that one could have, the pay is not good but one of the better jobs because you start to work at 8:00 in the morning and you're off at 2:30 or 3:00.  Between 3:00 and 6:00 you have the opportunity to do the marketing.  And from say 7:00 and later to whenever you're finished, you have the opportunity to do the products.  And the other thing is that once you get started you always use that chain-link marketing tool that I have this company and certainly we'd like you to come on board.  And once you start that and people have the respect of your repertoire of companies, it's easy that they would bring you on board.  Now, the problem of having been involved in that kind of thing, meaning that type of business, is that when you go to the bigger companies they also control your profit.  They indirectly tell you what they, they will pay which is not good.  And which to is a, a good lesson in business because one really has to learn the realms of, of how Corporate America really works.
Speaker 2: How long did you have the rubber stamp business?
Speaker 1: I went to Allstate in '71 [1971].  We had that business roughly three years going into that so I'm thinking what, '60 [1960], '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: And you said some of your major clients were?
Speaker 1: Sears Roebuck [Sears, Roebuck and Co.], Montgomery Ward, Argonne National Laboratories [Argonne National Laboratory], University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois], just to name a few.  We were busy.
Speaker 2: Would you be comfortable saying how much you think you made from that per year?
Speaker 1: Not a lot.  And I, I say that in that my entrepreneurial spirit has always been one to say don't look at the profit as much as the education of what you're doing because inevitably it will pay off.  And the process is what one needs to learn about.  If you focus on the money then that's the wrong angle by which the learning process take place.  Keep in mind business is such that one needs to learn how that work and we were literally self-taught out of trial and error but what we did learn, no one could take from you.  And the focus frankly was not so much on the money but to look at what you had asked from the standpoint of profit, we probably made for all intents and purpose relating back to that time, probably anywhere from four to five thousand dollars a month profit after all expenses.
Story_ID: 444359
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about how you happened to become an Allstate [Allstate Corporation] agent?
Speaker 2: Very unusual.  One of my business partners in the, in the rubber stamp business [Bailey's Stamp Works (ph.)] had a brother on the police force and he off-duty worked at a Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] department store on 63rd [Street] and Halsted [Street].  And at the time in '71 [1971] when I came to Allstate, the Allstate marketing tool was to have booths in Sears department stores, that's how they marketed the insurance.  So in every Sears department store was an Allstate booth and they rotated agents out every four hours of the day by which the store was open.  And my partner's brother had gotten in conversation with an Allstate agent and, of course, the agent was white and not black, and the agent was telling his brother how much money an agent made.  And that was unbelievable at the time.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what that amount was?
Speaker 2: In '71 [1971], the, the average agent was making like forty thousand dollars in '71 [1971] which correlatively speaking today is probably like a $100,000.  And it was really unbelievable to us when the message came back.  And when we heard about that we went to interview with Allstate and that's when I was reflecting to you that Allstate was not hiring.  And when we went to get interviewed, they hired all three of us.
Speaker 1: And that was you, Nolan [Nolan Harrison], and Forest [Forest Bailey]?
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: And all of you were teachers?
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: Making five thousand dollars (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well, it was slightly more than that then but the big thing that had happened there is that I've never been a person who believed in hearsay.  Having gone to Allstate, they had two segments of marketing, the Sears marketing was one tool, they had another tier of agents that were in offices and this tier was in Skokie, Illinois, and to verify what I was told I went to talk to the agents there and the one that I talked to, and I remember today his name was Deon Sheronis [ph.], a, a Greek guy, and when I went I was so impressed with the ambiance of the office and more so with the attire of the agents there and got in conversation with Mr. Sheronis and asked him what the average pay in that office was, it was $40,000 in a Sears store, it was $150,000 in that office.  And my thought process was that no matter what the marketing tool was nobody was three times greater than I, so if I could get the job I knew I could make at least one-third of what he was making.  And that was the thought process that I had in terms of going, trying to get that job.
Story_ID: 444360
Speaker 1: And tell me what happened after that?
Speaker 2: Well, once I was hired they assigned me to a Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] department store and they had what they called A and, A, B, and C stores.  A store is the biggest stores, B, and according to the letter, you know, that's the size, but they assigned me to a B store which was on a 112th [Street] and State [Street].  And the--
Speaker 1: So that had nothing to do with the, the community that it was in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.
Speaker 1: --did, it was just the size of the store?
Speaker 2: Size of the store--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that that you were, that you would be assigned too.  However, that community was 100 percent white at that time that I was assigned the, that store.  In fact, that was a transitional period with the company.  I was the second agent of my color because Forest [Forest Bailey] and Nolan [Nolan Harrison] came there after me that they hired.  The other agents that they had hired before us were mulattoes and we were 17, 18, and 19th agents that they hired that were black in the company at that time.  And what had they told me was that there would be people that would come and ask for insurance and you'd quote them and you come back the next day and your partner would have written them because that was part of the time, black folks would not be, white folks would not be purchasing insurance from white, from black folks.  That was just part of it, and it was accepted.  And that was part of what you had to accept.  So having been assigned to that I certainly quickly got exposed to it.  But that was part of the integration process at the time.  But having done that I was in that store for roughly six months and my volume was such that they promoted me to an office and I left the 112th and State Street store to move into an office on 91st [Street] and Stony Island [Avenue].  And that office had like fourteen agents in it.  And I stayed there for roughly five years and after having been there for that time, the mode of marketing and the problems in the industry was such that the companies moved out of the City of Chicago [Illinois] all together.  Allstate [Allstate Corporation] moved all agents out of the city except the ones in the Sears Tower [Willis Tower, Chicago, Illinois], everybody had to go to suburbia.  I went to Matteson, Illinois.  GEICO [Government Employees Insurance Company] almost went out of business and the big companies subsidized GEICO, which is an affluent company now, to keep them in business.
Story_ID: 444361
Speaker 1: Take me back just a little to this store--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --on--
Speaker 2: 112th [Street] and State [Street].
Speaker 1: --on a 112th and State.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You said that the, they had indicated that you may quote the policy--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but that the white agent may end up writing it?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: And but that didn't seem to be your experience?
Speaker 2: It did, it was.  I lived that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Too long though because you--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --you said your volume went up so high?
Speaker 2: --well, what happened is that you live that but there are still opportunities.  I mean, you get a, you're gonna get a blend, you're gonna lose but you're gonna win too but the idea is that you win more than you lose, um-hm, um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did you, that community though was predominantly--
Speaker 2: White.
Speaker 1: --white.
Speaker 2: Sure.  All white literally at that time.
Speaker 1: So then you were a black agent--
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --an African American agent--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --of color.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Not a mulatto?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you were writing primarily for white customers?
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: And how did, how did you feel that you were able to kind of work that?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: And during a time when, when we were in the midst (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you know, in sales there are two elements that you have to overcome.  The first one is that your appearance makes the difference, what they see makes a difference.  The second commodity is that you have to know what you're talking about and how you present it.  So refining those skills in terms of what you're doing, you're gonna excel no matter where you are, it may take more effort but with determination it's gonna happen.
Speaker 1: Where were your two friends [Nolan Harrison and Forest Bailey] working then (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Both were working at, well, one was working on 79th [Street] and Avalon [Avenue] at the Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] department store on 79th Street, and the other one, the other one worked on State Street and Van Buren [Street] (unclear)--
Speaker 1: So you were all doing pretty well though?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: As the first black agents?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So then when you, going back to the riots--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --do you feel that this, that it was the result of that time that helped you to become an Allstate [Allstate Corporation] agent?  I know we talked about you open, that opening the, the doors were opened more in Corporate America for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was a culmination, it was a culmination of the time, you know, there were all kinds of protests, the black power, the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party], all these segmented groups were out there really upsetting the apple cart and there had to be some means of, of organization, by which, Corporate America could demonstrate to bring the country together in order to keep things intact and to keep a sense of, of control there.  So the facts that all of these things were taking place simultaneously, anything that Corporate America could do on a positive side with people who had the skill set to make a difference, it only made good sense.
Speaker 1: And you were able to take advantage of--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --take advantage of that.
Story_ID: 444362
Speaker 1: So you were saying that then the agency moved out of town?
Speaker 2: Right.  I, when Allstate [Allstate Corporation] closed down all of the agent, well, all of the Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] department stores, they ridded all the stores of agents.  All of the offices in Chicago [Illinois] except Sears Tower [Willis Tower], the agents had to leave and go on a periphery because the inner city was too much of a challenge from the standpoint of losses.  In other words, the control of how insurance works was such that the losses were too great.
Speaker 1: You were writing what type of insurance (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) See, the--
Speaker 1: --in households?
Speaker 2: --well, see the blessing with an Allstate type of marketing company, we sell everything.  What I mean by that, we sell home, life, health, commercial, motor club, disability, we had a whole toolbox, whatever the issues were, and needs were at the time, that was part of the repertoire of what we had.  And there was an advantage of this type of company, that's how you made a lot of money because you didn't have to go to a person and say oh, I don't sell that, you sell everything.  You know, it was a greater challenge to be licensed and to learn all of the innuendos and, and, and, and the skill sets to market it.  But once that was mastered then the bottom line is that the opportunities were there--
Story_ID: 444363
Speaker 1: You went to Matteson [Illinois] and, and tell me what happened then.
Speaker 2: Well, I went to Matteson, Illinois, and certainly that was a, an office similarly to the office on Stony Island [Avenue].  And the theory that the companies had there is they were seeking a mix of business.  In other words, in the city [Chicago, Illinois] you were too concentrated on a high loss ratio situation.  And the way insurance works there are two, two profits.  There's a profit on the investment side that means the money they take daily, and there's a profit on the underwriting side.  Those are the underwriting rules to say who qualifies at what price.  And the bigger companies and the most profitable companies have to get a profit in both areas.  It is not a situation by which they can take one and not the other, otherwise they're losing their efficiency as well as getting away from the philosophy that they have as to how they make money.
Speaker 1: When you say that they were, the high losses was that in a particular community?
Speaker 2: Well, that's the city all together.  Keep in mind, you just went through the riot situation, the city is in an uproar, things have been torn apart, people were unstable.  And keep in mind with that kind of environment, the claims go up be it legitimate or illegitimate.  And in other words, if the losses are greater than the profits, you're gonna do one or two things, you're gonna make a change or you're gonna go out of business, so they chose to make a change.
Speaker 1: And your move to the suburb was then to attract more suburban business or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  They're, they're looking for a blend.  In other words, if you blend what you have in the city with the suburban business then your loss ratios will change.
Speaker 1: And so how was that for you?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: How was that--
Speaker 2: Well, it worked (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) that move?
Speaker 2: It, it, it worked.  You know, the theory was that it was a, a challenge to go back and forth to work because when I was on 91st Street I lived two blocks from where I live, I mean, I worked two blocks from where I lived.  But to add on a, a forty minute drive, that certainly was a challenge but when you realize the kind of money that you're making, you, you'd drive to Bloomington [Illinois] every day.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: So, you know, you take the mindset, um-hm.
Speaker 1: You, what was your status in the company [Allstate Corporation] then, you were considered one of the top salesmen?
Speaker 2: I've always been one of the top salesmen.  In fact, even today I have more life insurance policies than anybody in the company.
Speaker 1: Is that right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You were part of the Chairman's Inner Circle for some years?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And at, if you don't mind me asking, at what, what would your money, what would your income be then at that time?  How much were you generating for the company to be a part of the Chairman's Circle?
Speaker 2: It wasn't the money that you would be paid, it was the production on the life side.  The Chairman's Inner Circle is a blend of loss ratios plus how much life insurance you sell.  And you really would always have to be in the million dollar round table.  So every year you'd have to do that.  And you start off in January from scratch.
Story_ID: 444364
Speaker 1: After Allstate [Allstate Corporation] you started your own insurance agency [Louis Dodd Insurance Agency] or how, how did that work, was that a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--
Speaker 1: --subsidiary of Allstate?
Speaker 2: --well, the industry has gone through a number of evolutions.  Remember I told you that the inception was to market in the Sears [Sears, Roebuck and Co.] department store, they left the Sears department store and had what is called the satellite offices meaning that there were a number of people in our office.  When I mentioned to you about the Matteson [Illinois] as well as the Stony Island [Avenue] office we had as many as ten to fourteen people in our office depending upon where we were located.  Now, once that happened the next segment of evolution came the independent office, meaning that you buy your book of business, you go out on your own and you do the best you can, and that's where we are now.
Speaker 1: How many other African American insurance agencies were developing during this time from the time you went in with Allstate?  Other agents, I know that you had your two friends [Nolan Harrison and Forest Bailey] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--
Speaker 1: --but what--
Speaker 2: --keep in mind, we were the pioneers.  Once the success had taken place, they continued to hire minorities, not just blacks but they hired Hispanics, they hired Asians, and the idea was that they wanted to penetrate these communities and they needed to have a success factor in order to do it.
Story_ID: 444365
Speaker 1: So after Allstate [Allstate Corporation] or during Allstate's time there you also had developed a relationship with the Highland Bank [Highland Community Bank, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: I had been a depositor at Highland Bank over the course of a long number of years.  By the way, my first savings account was with Illinois Federal [Illinois Service Federal Savings and Loan Association, Chicago, Illinois], they used to be on 47th [Street] and Wabash [Avenue] and I certainly have been heavily involved with them but and always have had an account with them.  But Highland Bank has frankly at that time was my primary bank of, of deposit.  And having--
Speaker 1: And was that because they were an African American bank and you wanted, because Illinois Federal Savings was one.
Speaker 2: Well, Illinois Federal Savings was a, a savings and loan but they were Afro American as well (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A savings and loan, right.
Speaker 2: But Highland was a, a bank as opposed to a savings and loan which certainly provided a lot more services than at that time, than the savings and loan could provide.  Having done that and also having an entrepreneurial spirit, I became interested in buying stock and pursued that that that arena.  In fact, I own 20 percent of Highland stock as we speak.  And as an end result of buying stock I became a board member and have had a number of, of positions at the bank, vice chairman and president at one time.
Story_ID: 444366
Speaker 1: Tell me about, if you don't mind, the situation with Highland Bank [Highland Community Bank, Chicago, Illinois] and Allstate [Allstate Corporation] with the redlining?  Wasn't there a problem--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: At--
Speaker 2: --insurance companies have been accused of redlining for a lot, a long number of years.  And what that really means is that the companies have what has been described as unfair rules that not allows certain segments of the community to be insured.  And that historically has been a problem.  And the reconcilement of the problem today has been that they don't have these rules that you quote unquote, are out there, but they price you out.  In other words, rather than to say there is a rule that will not allow a community to be insured, they will raise the price in that zip code by which you cannot afford or you will not pay, so indirectly they force you to make a decision as to whether you want to pay that price and stay with them or to get a, a better price and go to another suitor.
Speaker 1: And during this period though when there was a issue with Englewood [Chicago, Illinois], with the Englewood communities specifically, you were with Allstate as well as with the bank, so how did you, how did that, tell us a little bit about that?
Speaker 2: Well, with the bank that's the easy part in the sense that Highland is a black bank from the standpoint of ownership from the posture of Allstate, you don't make the rules, you interpret the rules and you work within the rules.  So consequently one had to market the product that they put out there.  The companies don't ask your opinion as to what you think about any situation.  They explicitly describe what they have and under what circumstance they want to market this product.  So, you know, you have two different hats.  And when I'm in the banking industry have one hat, I'm in the insurance industry have on a different hat, so it, you, you separate the two and you move forward.  And the issue is that you look for progress and accomplishments depending on what hat you have on.

Speaker 1: You said that you had several positions with the bank?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yes, can you tell us a little bit about it and which ones you may have enjoyed more than others and, and how, and just your feeling about the importance of African American banks in the African American community?
Speaker 2: Afro American banks and bank in general, let me just go back and say, banks in general are the anchors of a community, that and the church.  When you have a stable and a viable and incorporating institution, be it the church or the bank, you're gonna have a strong community.  And these are anchors by which strong communities can and should be developed.  I started certainly with Highland [Highland Community Bank, Chicago, Illinois] buying stock and became a board member in I think '73 [1973], and matriculated in that institution from just board member to vice chairman and at one point in time for a year I was the president of the institution, due to the fact that there were some regulatory elements that needed to be satisfied and the president that was there at the time, had to be removed.  So with that in mind, I did gain a lot of experience in terms of banking operations, not only from the standpoint of the presidency but also from the standpoint of the vice chairman as far as responsibilities and the workings of an institution.
Speaker 1: And we have in the city, two other major black banks, that Seaway [Seaway National Bank; Seaway Bank and Trust Company, Chicago, Illinois] and, and Illinois, well, Illinois Federal [Illinois Service Federal Savings and Loan Association, Chicago, Illinois] is a--
Speaker 2: Savings and loans (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) savings and loan--
Speaker 2: Right, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --association--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --with Seaway Banks.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How did the two of you work together as far as the--
Speaker 2: Believe it or not--
Speaker 1: --for the interest of the community?
Speaker 2: --believe or not, there is a great cooperation with institutions of that nature because you're the only show in town.  When I say that, you share loans and because of the size of the institution, you are limited in terms of your, your lending power and oftentimes you share a loan with the sister institution in order to get it accomplished.  You also share similar problems and the communications that you have is vital in terms of growth as well as the service to the community so you tend to work very closely with the other institutions relatively speaking to the goals that you have as well as the accomplishments that you may make.
Story_ID: 444368
Speaker 1: You also have been involved in several other businesses.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us of a couple of them?
Speaker 2: Yes, I--
Speaker 1: Starting with the, after the stamp company, after Bailey's Stamps [Bailey's Stamp Works (ph.)].
Speaker 2: Okay.  After the stamp company came the car wash.  The name of the company was Rolls Royce Car Wash, and we did receive a note from Rolls Royce about that name but we certainly ironed out that problem.  That business was located on 7001 S. Stony Island [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Can you just tell me, tell us how you ironed that out with--
Speaker 2: Well, Rolls Royce indicated that they had a patent on their name.  And certainly they do have a patent but the way our corporation was setup, we just had a, a technical element in the name that separated us by which there wouldn't be no lawsuit on the corporate side.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we had been in business roughly four years before they even made that contact.  But again that was quite a, a, a, feat in (unclear) right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm sure.
Speaker 2: There's no doubt about it.
Speaker 1: I'm sure.
Speaker 2: But the blessing there was we did not only car wash but we, it was a gas station and also a service station meaning we repaired cars so we had a, a multiplicity of things going on there.  And frankly, at that time there were only two Afro American car washes in the city.  A gentleman by the name of Bill Phillips [William J. Phillips] had the other and he is still today called the godfather of car washes on the black side.  And when I say that type of car wash, these are heavy machines and during certain times of the year, every three minutes you literally have to have a car going through, you know, during the wintertime.  A very profitable business to operate and in our case we were operating that as well as gas which was a Mobil gas station, and also the repair of cars, so we had three business, businesses in one going on there.
Story_ID: 444369
Speaker 1: Rolls Royce Car Wash--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --was your, more like Rolls Royce multiservice (laughter).
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely, there's no doubt about it.
Speaker 1: One stop shopping (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --for the car.  Now were you, were you in partnership, you said we?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was this you and whom?
Speaker 2: I had a friend or better yet still have a friend (unclear) friends by the way, partners, Donald Olds, still an Allstate [Allstate Corporation] agent, and a gentleman by the name of Ruben Minor [ph.].
Speaker 1: Donald--
Speaker 2: Donald Olds, O-L-D-S.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  And another gentleman by the name of Ruben Minor who has since retired but spent a, a large number of years with Marsh and McLennan insurance agency [Marsh and McLennan Agency] in Chicago [Illinois] as well as New York City [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: And these were your partners?
Speaker 2: They were my partners, right.
Story_ID: 444370
Speaker 1: Going back to Allstate [Allstate Corporation] just for a minute.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did you influence or help to bring other young African Americans into the insurance business?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely. One (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell us a little bit about that.
Speaker 2: One of, one of the marketing tools that Allstate has always had and part of the reason why they took us on, meaning my partners [Nolan Harrison and Forest Bailey] and I, was to give leverage to their philosophy on a moving forward basis.  Meaning that the future hirees would oftentimes be referred to come and talk to us or at some point even be tutored by us relatively speaking to the philosophy of what the company is seeking and in some instances even fine-tune their skills.  So it has always been a part to really assist where you can and we relish the idea of having that opportunity and also to make aware to future persons to work in this industry of what the possibilities are as far as having a career, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Is there someone in particular that you can think of that you may have mentored early on that has become very successful?
Speaker 2: Wow.  Tons of people.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about it a little or them?
Speaker 2: I need to go back frankly to the most recent person.  His name was, or better yet his name is James Day [ph.], he's in Harvey [Illinois] now.  The name that I have in terms of the Afro Americans in Allstate is that the, the godfather in terms of having been around so long I guess everybody thought I, by now I should have retired.  And the people that came along with me have retired but, you know, I mentioned to you about the passion for the business and if you like what you do you're not seeking retirement and frankly you're not seeking the money.  Everybody wants money, but you gotta enjoy what you do.  And, and in my case, I view my activities on the business side as a game that I love to play but also love to win.  And you keep your mind on the prize, meaning the prize is the ability to on a daily basis accomplish whatever goal you put out there and to be able to measure and see that this is relevant to what you really want your life to be.  The gentleman that I was just mentioning, Mr. Day, he had come to me and before even getting hired and just wanted to be around and work for nothing just to see operations and to find out what actually does go on.  One of the biggest challenges in a business of, of the insurance nature is that it's a two-fold business.  One is to sell the insurance but just as importantly is to manage your business, two different roles.  It is very difficult to learn both at the same time.  And that really creates havoc if a person does not or they, they literally have to be lucky if they don't have experience in one of those skill sets because you're doing simultaneous things and you're shooting in the dark and hoping you hit something and typically that's a recipe for failure.
Story_ID: 444371
Speaker 1: What advice would you give to someone at this time in their life if they were looking to go into insurance?
Speaker 2: I think that insurance is still a frontier for a person who has a passion on a fast-track, challenging, and a heavily rewarding basis.  It is not easy and if it were everybody would be doing it.  I would think that only 1 percent would be successful.  In this type of industry you're in one of two places, either you're at the top of the heap or you're at the bottom, there is no middle ground, it's paramount to being in business, in business one or two things happening, you're either growing or you're going out of business.  And if someone tells you anything any differently, they're not being realistic.  So one has to recognize that there are no middle grounds in, in, in, in that, in this industry.
Story_ID: 444372
Speaker 1: --You were telling me about your car wash [Rolls Royce Car Wash]?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: And then I'd like for you to tell us about some of the other businesses that you've--
Speaker 2: I went into the lounge business, which was a, a tremendous experience.  We owned a, a lounge on the West Side of Chicago [Illinois] in a motel that was new and the lounge had not been open and one of my business partners who had a ton of experience in that arena, that's why I was saying when you go into business someone has to know what they're doing.  And I told him I wanted to go into it, he wanted no part but I drug him in with me.  And I can remember the first day that we went in business, again this was a, a lounge by which was in existence in a hotel, motel rather that had never been opened.  The first day we made twelve dollars.  He called me and told me--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --"Listen, we, we made a mistake."  Keep in mind he had been in this business for thirty years before we went into this one.  And we persisted.  Frankly that place turned out to be per dollar the greatest return on dollar that we ever had.
Speaker 1: And what was the name of it?
Speaker 2: Esquire Lounge [Chicago, Illinois].  We sold it to a guy who (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I think I heard of that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We sold it to a guy from, on the West Side by the name of Earl Smith [ph.].  And Earl quit his job as a salesman and now he's a real estate tycoon on the West Side as a result of, of that that business.  This was such a fascinating time until--
Speaker 1: And what year was this?
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty [1980] to '85 [1985].  We had an unusual marketing tool.  We had it such that you had to be buzzed in to get into the lounge.  In other words there was a buzzer on the door.  At two o'clock in the afternoon you could not get in, it would be filled.  People would leave work for lunch and would not got out, I mean, they just stayed there literally the whole time, it was just a, a happening.
Speaker 1: Did you have a, a restaurant as part of it or--
Speaker 2: No, no, just an unusual situation.  A very nice high-class place but people would go home after work and put on their suits and sport coats just to be come out.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Just an amazing, it was just part of the times, that's all.  But we sold it because he and I both lived on the same, on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] and to go back and forth was just too much for us.  Additionally, we, and he's my partner today, but we (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And this is Mr.--
Speaker 2: White, White.
Speaker 1: Mr.--
Speaker 2: James White.  We--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --we've just gone into bigger things.
Story_ID: 444373
Speaker 1: We owned a medical center on 99th [Street] and Halsted [Street].
Speaker 2: And the name of it is?
Speaker 1: Kermit Coleman Medical Center [ph.].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It's a church now.  And we had leased that building out which roughly had like fifteen thousand square feet to a number of medical facilities.  I meant medical companies, I'm trying to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When you say medical companies, you mean like pharmacies, like prosthetics companies or what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, no, no, I'm, I'm, I'm saying the HMO [health maintenance organization] type system of the, the hospitals who have the off satellite offices.  They would, and we had like three different leases before we sold it to a church, um-hm.  Advocate was one of the, Advocate--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --Health Care [Advocate Health Care].  And they, we would, we had long term leases, five year leases, but we kept that like fifteen years and since have sold it.
Speaker 2: So you just owned the property and leased--
Speaker 1: No, no, no, we, we owned the building and, and, and the, the land.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Right.  And they come in and they equipped the building to their, to their, their, their desires.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 444374
Speaker 1: The South Parkway Inn [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well, South Parkway Inn is where you are right now.  There were others before this one [Chicago South Loop Hotel, Chicago, Illinois] by the way.  Our first venture on the hotel side, by the way I needed to tell you that I had been aware through my brother-in-law, which is a partner in this institution, the profits in the lodging business but could not get accepted through the group because they didn't need me for two reasons: number one, I was too young.  And number two, they didn't need the money.  They had both (simultaneous--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now the group is, tell us about the group.
Speaker 2: This is the group that frankly owned the hotel, motel by the name of Michigan Plaza [Michigan Plaza Hotel, Chicago, Illinois] which is the predecessor of South Parkway Inn.  The problem with the lodging business and blacks in Chicago [Illinois] historically has been that you could not get financed and it's still a problem today.  But the group that really developed and frankly was shortly after the Roberts [ph.] era and during the Roberts era, was the group that I was telling you the Michigan Plaza group.  The story goes that when they were putting the group together they had thirty people to come and invest in the idea but they had to raise money and upon inquiring from the people to purchase the land they needed a thousand dollars from each person so they would have thirty thousand.  The second meeting, fifteen people showed up.  So that didn't work at all.  But this was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This was a group of African Americans?
Speaker 2: Afro Americans.  And the, the, the problem again was that you could not raise the money and you could not borrow the money.  Raising money is with individuals, borrowing the money would be through the institutions but you have to get the seed money in order to go to the institutions to get money.  They finally did get a group together, fourteen people, to build the Michigan Plaza Hotel.  They did get financed through an insurance company and they were successful for roughly twenty years.  And my pursuit was to get in the business but could not get anybody's ear to listen to me.
Story_ID: 444375
Speaker 1: What happened there is that one of the gentlemen who had three motels died in a plane accident, his name was C.F. Moore [Charles F. Moore].  And his estate sold off the motels.  My present business partner [James White] we had been partners on the medical center [Kermit Coleman Medical Center (ph.)], had decided that the two of us would bid on one of the motels.  And we ended up bidding on two, but we did get one.  And we ended up with the one on 79th [Street] and Vincennes [Avenue], that's called Dew Central [Dew Central Motel, Chicago, Illinois].  That was my first lodging experience.  This was in '89 [1989].  And the two of us ran that up until roughly five years ago we sold it.  And that was a success.  We in turn built the Amber Inn [Chicago, Illinois] on 39th [Street] and Michigan [Avenue], the two of us.  And that property is ten years old now.  And that's the property that has Pearl's Place restaurant and we developed that.  But in developing that property there was a gas station across the street that they were selling mattresses in front of the gas station and we couldn't have that occur--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Right.
Speaker 1: --and have a, a, a, a classy--
Speaker 2: A--
Speaker 1: --(laughter) hotel.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: So we had to find a way to buy the gas station and, and we struggled to do that and we put up that fast food place, that's what you see over there now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Right.  So we own that as well.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So we couldn't have your front porch being--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --being the front of some mattresses that people were selling.  So we, we had that.  Now, in the meantime, I was not a part of the Michigan Plaza [Michigan Plaza Hotel, Chicago, Illinois] group but that group had been in place so long until the people were dying, they were older gentlemen.  And the opportunity came up whereby I bought into that group and we paid off those, frankly it was gonna be fourteen people but we kept one, so it ended up being three people that was owned the Michigan Plaza but we changed the name to South Parkway Inn [Chicago, Illinois].
Story_ID: 444376
Speaker 1: I'd just like to go back one--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --little bit.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: For you to tell me about the group, that very first group that you mentioned--
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) when you were--
Speaker 2: --I only remember a couple of people in that fourteen person group other than the two that I had to take with me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I had to take with me the controlling folks of that group.  And what happened was that I was gonna take it all myself but I also had to go back to give them or sell them the opportunity to come with me, do you follow what I'm saying?  In other words one of the controlling group persons, who is still my partner today, felt that because of his age and that's who you'll be interviewing next, that he wanted to get out.
Speaker 1: And his name is?
Speaker 2: James White.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  He wanted to get out because of his age.  And said that, "Hey, listen I'm gonna sell."  And then I said, "I'm gonna buy."  So, the other people sold and he sold, then he bought back.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: You see what I'm saying?  So everybody sold but he bought back and became my partner.
Speaker 1: But, but there were fourteen men around--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, right.
Speaker 1: During this time--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --that were black businessmen--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --that had enough money--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --to buy, to finance (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) To put--
Speaker 1: --hotels?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: To, to buy--
Speaker 2: --to put, to put the--
Speaker 1: --to put the--
Speaker 2: --put the deal together.  That that's essential because no bank would loan them money and did not loan them money.  An insurance company loaned money, Metropolitan [Metropolitan Insurance Company, Chicago, Illinois] loaned money.
Speaker 1: And who were those fourteen men?
Speaker 2: I can get the names (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Other--
Speaker 2: --I can get the names for you but--
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of them?
Speaker 2: One's name was Frank Sara [ph.].  The partner with me now is Dr. Floyd Mix, the other partner is James White.  Those other names I have on paper but I just don't remember them.
Speaker 1: But they put, they were the ones that put up the initial money?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then Metropolitan--
Speaker 2: Insurance Company.
Speaker 1: Insurance Company--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --financed--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: -the deal?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And from there--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --that is how you got your first hotel?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Correct?  Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  Right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  Straighten me out on that one.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's how we got here.
Speaker 1: Ah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The first hotel came with that accident in that, on that plane whereby we bidded on the hotel from C.F. Moore [Charles F. Moore].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  And, and keep in mind up until then, nobody wanted any part of me.
Speaker 1: Was that Moore Construction Company?
Speaker 2: C.F. Moore Construction [Charles F. Moore Construction Co., Chicago, Illinois], right, he's a friend of mine.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: He was a friend of mine.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: He was the biggest black construction company in the U.S. at the time when he died in a plane accident.  And he died in his own plane.
Speaker 1: Do you recall what year that was?  'Cause I remember that but I didn't--
Speaker 2: Yeah, because we bought Dew Central [Dew Central Motel, Chicago, Illinois] in '89 [1989], it happened in '88 [1988].
Story_ID: 444377
Speaker 1: So you had the Rolls Royce Car Wash?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: The Kermit Coleman Medical Center [ph.]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Then we went to the hotel business--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --hotel business.
Speaker 2: But we're also in the land business too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Tell me about that.  Tell me about all your businesses.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) We wanna know you.
Speaker 2: --my, my, my main business partner, James White, he and I just typically do deals.  We bought Michigan Royal Hotel [sic. Royal Michigan Motel, Chicago, Illinois] which was on 37th [Street] and Michigan [Avenue] and we sold that property and tore it down to develop this new property.  We have two hundred acres of land in Beecher, Illinois, adjacent to the city limits and was going to sell that land to move the money into this project on a rollover deal and had it sold but Beecher community killed the deal, and I think they found out we were black, but they killed the deal and it didn't go through.  The papers were literally signed but they killed the deal.  We have another sixty acres in Grant Park, Illinois, on Route 1 [Illinois Route 1] right on the corner.  We have another forty-five acres of land in Sauk Village [Illinois] right on 390 [sic. Illinois Route 394] at the intersection of, of Sauk Trail.  In terms of, of this prime land there.  And we also own several lots around Amber Inn [Chicago, Illinois].  We were going to develop that into a bigger facility but HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development] blocked us in terms of that and sold it to somebody else.
Story_ID: 444378
Speaker 1: Has that been a very lucrative facility?
Speaker 2: Which is that now?
Speaker 1: The Amber Inn [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: The lodging business is a very lucrative business.  They don't want you in it but if you get in it, it's very lucrative.  And you'll find very few people who can get in it and they price you out.  We had very difficult time even getting a mortgage here.  It was, we even had a commitment letter here to finance this deal, the last moment they changed their mind.  So it's a very lucrative business.
Speaker 1: And why do you think the financing was, I mean, you're, you're, you were certainly credit worthy--
Speaker 2: Well, that that--
Speaker 1: --why do you think they--
Speaker 2: --that that is true.  You'll never know the--
Speaker 1: The reasons.
Speaker 2: --innuendos of what happened but I can tell you even in this deal we were 70 percent equity and we were only financing 30 percent and they still didn't wanna do it.  And these are the banks.  I mean, we got it done but I'm just saying to you, it is a very tough business to get into but a very lucrative business, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, Amber Inn also houses a restaurant?
Speaker 2: It does.
Speaker 1: And that--
Speaker 2: Right.  When we developed Amber Inn we were sold Amber to get the operating facility, we're in the hotel business, we're not in any other business, even here, we don't operate anything but hotel, we don't deal with the ancillary services at all.  It enhances what we do but we don't get involved in that.  But having been there we decided that that was not part of what we wanted to do but I ventured out to say I will develop the restaurant on my own.  And I brought my family in to assist in that business and the name of the restaurant is called Pearl's [Pearl's Place, Chicago, Illinois] and I always wanted to clear the name whereby it is not a colloquialism that reflects a southern implication but it is a name that my wife [HistoryMaker Alma Dodd] really brought forth in describing our daughter, her name is Courtney Dodd but in her mind she's a jewel and it's a pearl--
Speaker 1: Ah (laughter).
Speaker 2: --so that's how the name Pearl was, was derived.  Now, that restaurant really has a unique background.  The pictures in that restaurant depict the history of black folks in the '20s [1920s], '30s [1930s], '40s [1940s], and '50s [1950s] and our activities that took place in our neighborhood that can only take a part, take, take place in our neighborhood.  And it captures all those activities.  The Regal Theater [Chicago, Illinois], the Metropolitan Theatre [Chicago, Illinois], the DuSable High School [Chicago, Illinois] class is the, Dunbar [Dunbar Vocational High School; Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] situations, any historical point of interest in that community was captured or is captured in the pictures there.  There are pictures of for instance of Redd Foxx that even his family doesn't have and they've borrowed the picture to put in their own family repertoire.  But these are authentic pictures that really reflects the history of that community and we're quite proud of it.
Story_ID: 444379
Speaker 1: The personal, Mr. Dodd [HistoryMaker Louis Dodd].  Married, single?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: When did you first get married?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess I've always been a rebel in the sense of not wanting--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --to get married but I really got married the first time, this, the second day after I graduated from college [Chicago Teachers College; Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois].  I guess that's the best time to catch a good bachelor.  And I married a young lady by the name of Janice Owens [ph.] and from that marriage my son was born.  His name is Dr. Robert Louis Dodd [Robert Dodd], and he's a neurosurgeon at Stanford University [Stanford University, Stanford, California].  And he works in their hospital and we're quite proud of him.  He's a M.D. Ph.D., and we're just quite happy to hear of his success.
Speaker 1: And you married a Chicago [Illinois] lady?
Speaker 2: Yes.  We frankly were high school sweethearts and that marriage lasted all of a year and it was such that being the unsettled person that I was and didn't know enough about life, it just didn't last.  It was certainly on me.  But after that, roughly seven to eight years later I met my present wife, Alma [HistoryMaker Alma Dodd], and we, we got married after having been together like, that is from the standpoint of courting for like three or four years, it was not an immediate thing (unclear)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: --so.  And she and I have been married now thirty-five years.
Speaker 1: And she's in business with you?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She ironically owns one of the agencies, there are two agencies that we have that's housed in the same building which we own.  Her agency is called Dodd's Insurance Agency and my agency is called Louis Dodd Insurance Agency.  Of course, both are housed in the same building, we share the same staff but independently operated.
Story_ID: 444380
Speaker 1: We've talked about all of your other business ventures, I think.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did we get them all?  The ones that I had?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Were there any more than I should have discussed, we had the, the Amber Inn [Chicago, Illinois] and this hotel [Chicago South Loop Hotel, Chicago, Illinois], Rolls Royce [Rolls Royce Car Wash], Kermit Coleman Medical Center [ph.]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and you mentioned the land--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that you have.
Speaker 2: The Dew Central hotel, Dew Central Motel [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: The Dew Central Motel--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --we mentioned that.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And is there any, was there any other that--
Speaker 2: No, no, that, that, that, that's about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now, what I didn't ask you about was your involvement with social, with social (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And, and also my two children [Robert Dodd and Courtney Dodd].
Speaker 1: --and political.  And your two children--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh
Speaker 1: --and your wife [HistoryMaker Alma Dodd].
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, okay, yeah.
Speaker 1: Gotta get to that.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And then were you active with--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --with Mayor Washington [Harold Washington] with--
Speaker 2: No, frankly, that was just before my time in terms of involvement.
Speaker 1: Okay.  'Cause we didn't talk about any political--
Speaker 2: Right, um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Or is there, is there anything you'd like to say about that?
Speaker 2: No, not, not at all.  You know--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you can't get anything done in Chicago [Illinois] unless you are but it's kind of an (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But I mean as far as--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --any, any other social organizations like Operation PUSH [Rainbow PUSH Coalition, Chicago, Illinois] or any of those political organizations?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, other than belonging to them, you know, there are a couple of clubs that I belong to, the Chicagoans, the Chicago Assembly [Chicago, Illinois], and also the Guardsmen, those are the three clubs that (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, you're a Guardsmen?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, uh-huh, you're familiar with them then?
Speaker 1: I've, I entertained for you all one year.
Speaker 2: Wonderful.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah, I did.
Speaker 2: That is, okay.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What's his name?  That used to be deputy superintendent of police? Ira.
Speaker 2: Right, okay.  Right.
Speaker 1: Ira Harris.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Small world.
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.  Small world.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, indeed.
Speaker 1: And Dr. Lacey.
Speaker 2: Sure, sure, I know him (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Roy Lacey, he's a good friend of mine.  We were neighbors.
Speaker 2: Wonderful.
Speaker 1: I lived in Olympia Fields [Olympia Fields, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Fantastic.  Small world.
Speaker 1: For seventeen years, yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, my goodness, okay, I didn't know that.
Speaker 1: That's how I knew Peggy [ph.] and all of them.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Fantastic, that's fantastic.
Speaker 1: I was so glad to get back to the city.
Speaker 2: Oh, (unclear).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: You know, that's part of what I really enjoy in that we're like twenty minutes from the city and the airports as well so it to me is the best of both worlds in terms of (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Best of both worlds.
Speaker 2: I hated it out there.
Speaker 1: Oh, my goodness.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 444381
Speaker 1: You mentioned your wife--
Speaker 2: Sure (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) you have a, she's in business also, insurance business?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she owns [Dodd's Insurance Agency] a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is that how you met?
Speaker 2: No, in fact coincidently we met while teaching.  I was teaching at Forrestville Upper Grade Center [Chicago, Illinois] and she was teaching at a school, an elementary school by the name of Woodson [Woodson North Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois].  And we met in, I, in, in, in the summer I think of, of like '68 [1968] and she was teaching summer school and I was teaching summer school as well.  And she in turn that was just a, a summer job for her but she had a, a regular job at a, another school that was far south, Dixon Elementary School [Arthur Dixon Elementary School, Chicago, Illinois]  to be exact which is on 83rd Street but I was still at Forrestville.  And we didn't talk to each other for a, a couple of years and afterwards coincidently we got back in contact with each other and started to date and, and got married shortly thereafter.  But it was after two years of having met each other that we didn't forget each other and started to go back and see each other, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you have two children?
Speaker 2: Right.  We have the oldest daughter, her name is Kimberly Yelverton but that that's Alma's [HistoryMaker Alma Dodd] daughter out of her first marriage, and we have a daughter by both of us her name is Courtney Dodd.  And Kim works in the office, she's the heir apparent on the side of the insurance.  And Courtney works for Northern Trust [Northern Trust Corporation, Chicago, Illinois] bank, she's a senior analyst with them in terms of their home office on Monroe Street.
Speaker 1: How do you, how do you feel that, you mentioned that your daughter is the heir apparent?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: How do you feel about children going into their parents' business?
Speaker 2: Very good question that you bring that up.  And it's not coincidental in terms of my philosophy about this.  I believe that once a child has a formal education, meaning that they have gone to college and, and in my particular situation, Kim has a master's degree in finance from the University of Illinois [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], I think that they should go out and work in Corporate America first before they come to a family business.  And therefore get the exposure to Corporate America in terms of how they treat you, what their philosophies are, and how they do business.  And when they come to a family business, typically they are welcomed to come into it because you understand what it's like to be in a different venue whereby you're not nourished and do not have a internal investment, whereby, you at one point in time will become the owner but still have the responsibility and the ideals that you have to be a competitive business owner on a moving forward basis so tying those two together really should make and hopefully will make a successful entrepreneur.
Speaker 1: And you are an entrepreneur in the truest sense.
Speaker 2: Well, we work hard.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: We work hard.
Speaker 1: And it sounds as if you, that spirit was, was put in you from your [maternal] grandfather [Louis Houston]?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: In fact, he had a philosophy of which though I was young, still stays with me.  He indicated that whatever you do in business you pay yourself first.  And if you run out of money somebody else didn't get it (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That's good.  I have to remember that.
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: That's very good.
Story_ID: 444382
Speaker 1: What I didn't talk to you about at all is you mentioned that your [maternal] grandfather [Louis Houston] was a, a minister--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --are you, are you affiliated with any church here?
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm a member of St. Ailbe's Church [St. Ailbe Catholic Church, Chicago, Illinois] on 91st [Street] and Stony Island [Avenue].  Have been there for like eighteen years.  We lived at 1700 West 91st Place for like twenty-two years before moving to suburbia.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, and St. Ailbe's is a Catholic Church (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Catholic Church--
Speaker 1: --correct?
Speaker 2: --of course, yes.
Story_ID: 444383
Speaker 1: I don't know, is there anything else that you would like to add for your interview that maybe we haven't discussed?
Speaker 2: Well, we didn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So that (unclear)--
Speaker 2: --you didn't talk about Chicago South Loop Hotel [Chicago, Illinois].  And this is a very interesting project.  We owned a motel prior to developing Chicago South Loop Hotel and the motel was called South Parkway Inn [Chicago, Illinois].  And that was a very successful business but did not relate to the future as well as the present as to what is going on in the city as well as the community.  We made a decision to tear down that business which certainly in our opinion was successful and venture out to build this institution.  This institution by the way took us three years to build.  And again, we have 232 rooms here, a number of meeting facilities, a lounge, two restaurants, a spa, not a spa but a fitness center but we are entertaining and interviewing for spa partners to come at this time.  We also have the business center as well as the gift shop and a florist that is part of our, our commercial experience here.  We're all partners in supporting each other but yet these are contractual partners and experienced people who have been in their businesses for a long time.
Speaker 1: So essentially they are, they have partnered with you in renting space here?
Speaker 2: That is exactly right.  That is exactly right.
Speaker 1: And your major service is--
Speaker 2: Is the lodging facility.
Speaker 1: Is the lodging.
Speaker 2: Right.  Our niche of and core business is really the conventioneer, the businesspersons, the organizations, the international traveler, and we have a team of people who market for us in those venues.  We certainly are members of a number of chamber of commerces, the tourism bureau, and certainly an active member in the community.
Story_ID: 444384
Speaker 1: Now would you say that, what is the percentage of African American businesses that are affiliated with those, those groups?
Speaker 2: Frankly if you look at a percentage, probably 20 to 25 percent simply because of the nature of what we do.  We have a boutique facility, meaning that we're independent, we make our own decision as to, decisions rather as to what we do.  We can do things quickly in terms of change whereby if you are a part of a flag, you not only have to get permission from them but they have a, a contract with you by which they can receive as much as 10 percent of your gross income.  We feel that our niche is such that because of our philosophy we really project and also deliver a service that is unique to what we do.  We have a cross section of employees that spans the nation, meaning that we have blacks, whites, Hispanics, Asians, that we employ on an equal opportunity basis.  And certainly have the philosophy that if you walked into the hotel, it is a hotel and unless someone tells you, you would never know who owns it.  However, the atmosphere is such that we want you to feel so comfortable until you certainly without being questioned will go back and tell your friends that this is the place to stay upon coming to Chicago [Illinois].  Our intent is to provide an experience by which you're close enough to the humdrum of the inner city but yet the peace, quiet, and tranquility of suburbia.  So you have the best of both worlds and the enjoyment whereby which one would continue to want to enjoy.  So that's where we are as far as the philosophy here in terms of Chicago South Loop [Chicago South Loop Hotel, Chicago, Illinois].  We feel that because this is the only black and the first black hotel in Chicago that's owned by native Chicagoans, that this is a oneness by which we want to project on a future level by which the younger people can look and be proud of and say that their goal is to get into this business, they know it can be done, and to amplify this on a higher level.  We are of the age by which had we not had that philosophy we could readily have retired and not have done what we did.  But because of our commitment to our community and to our race of people, we know that this is important to younger people as far as their futures are concerned to say that this can be done, this will, and shall be done, and it's a matter of putting their resources and their efforts and knowledge to make this happen.
Story_ID: 444385
Speaker 1: How do you feel about the way you've lived your life so far?
Speaker 2: You know, I'm happy with what I have done.  I sometimes wish I could have done more but you play the cards that you're dealt and you, you have to enjoy it.  My philosophy is not to look back but look forward and to enjoy every moment as if it's the last.
Speaker 1: You have done--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --so much, what more do you think you would have liked to have done?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, again, my thought is really to do more for young people, to share knowledge that I've experienced with them, that cannot be learned in school, and to have them amplify on what has been passed on.  I have experienced on the business side whereby my efforts to join respected businesspeople that I know had been unsuccessful because they would tell me that they don't need you, meaning that they don't need the knowledge, they don't need the money, and I think in hindsight because they were older they were fearful of the youth and we have to get beyond that and have to be dedicated and have a passion that we have to be a greater and more responsible person to the community in order to strengthen the community, and put self away from what one needs to do.  I think the pronouns are misplaced, it should not be an I and a me, it should be a we and an us.  It's not about me, it's about the enhancement of our community and where we live and the city, the state, and the world.
Story_ID: 444386
Speaker 1: What do you still want to do that you've not done yet?
Speaker 2: My goal again is to develop futuristically groups of entrepreneurs to do and to amplify what we have here.  Do it better, do it bigger, and do it quicker.  The big challenge now is that we have the knowledge, we have the know-how, the big challenge is to assimilate the locations by which to plant these seeds and to have a continuous source of income that would finance this and that's more readily and can be done now than historically in the past.  Again, I talked about the four minute mile, once that was run a lot of folks did it.  And what we've done here is to prove that this can be done.  We can go out now and line up financing which frankly is the challenge in this type of business and be successful at it because you have a track record as opposed to talking theory, you have something to say hey, listen, these are the numbers, these are the facts, now what is the problem?
Story_ID: 444387
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: My big concern frankly is the males in the community.  The absence of males and females in the business world, you can always go out and get a job that's the easy thing to do even when you fail in business you can always go back and get a job.  But we have to have the entrepreneurial spirit to take a chance but take a prudent chance to develop business.  And even if you fail you can't lose until you quit and not quitting means that you always have a chance to be successful.  But when you do fail at something there's a lesson there which as I have talked about earlier and when I was in high school [Dunbar Vocational High School; Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois], that should be a motivator when you get that discouragement to put forth more effort to become successful and it's a matter of, of being determined and having the passion.  And beyond all of that you gotta have the joy and the love for what you're doing.  You gotta see your goals as a game that you like to play but certainly like to win and, and that's important.
Story_ID: 444388
Speaker 1: Mr. Dodd [HistoryMaker Louis Dodd], why did you want to tell your story?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I wanted to share particularly with young people what trials and tribulations I have gone and experienced which is certainly unique to me as an individual of which unless it's told they would never know.  I have come through a number of errors by which you can hear about things and read about things and to have someone give a testimonial, it's totally different.  And one by which if one listens intently, there's a lot to be learned whereby the information can be used in the future that could be very, very important to the successes of a number of young people.
Speaker 1: Is there anything that we didn't talk about that you would like to talk about before we conclude?
Speaker 2: We've touched upon a number of things (laughter).  Don't wanna ruin your day but--
Speaker 1: You're not gonna ruin my day.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: We have plenty of tape (laughter).
Speaker 2: But we've touched upon frankly the highlights of what I feel is really important and should be shared and hopefully not be forgotten.
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --we'd like to thank you so much--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --for sharing your story.
Speaker 2: Thank you so much.  Thank you so much as well (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We thank you so much for being a HistoryMaker and it has certainly been a pleasure talking with you this afternoon.
Speaker 2: Thank you as well, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
