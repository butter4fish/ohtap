 Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Today is August 25th, 2009. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with  Oklahoma State University Library and we   re conducting an oral  history project called Oklahoma Centennial Farm Families. Today  we   re in Logan County, Oklahoma, in Guthrie, speaking with Frank  Ahrnsbrak. Thank you for having us today. We   ll start by having you tell  us how your family came to own the farm.  My father was a cowboy in the Cherokee Outlet when he was 17, 18  years of age. They had come from Iowa and had moved to the area of  South Haven and Honeywell. They knew that Oklahoma Territory was  going to be opened, and my father, in his travels, had found this farm  and he brought his father down, my grandfather. They looked at it to see  if there was evidence of flooding or anything and at that time they found  no evidence of flooding so on the Run of 1889, my father who was 18  and too young to actually claim, did make the Run or possibly was there  before the gun went off. When he got there, somebody else had beaten  him and was already on the place so he camped on the farm that joined it  on the north and when his father came down a day or two or so later by  wagon, some sort of negotiation was made and this farm, the one I own,  became the Ahrnsbrak claim. So that   s how the family came to own it.  I came to own it, my father died in 1936 and in his will I don   t  remember the exact detail of how the will was left, but when my brother  became 21 years of age, the farm was to be sold and divided among the  heirs. We were small children at that time, relatively small, and our  mother saw a lawyer here in Guthrie. He said that she could break the  will and she could take a child   s share of the inheritance instead of 1/3  and keep the farm as long as she lived on the farm. So that is what she  did. Then, later on after I had gone into the Army and my brother was  going here at OSU, my mother bought us a house in Marshall,  Oklahoma and moved off the farm. That was in 1945. Everything went  well until 1959 when  a  suit was brought by one of the in-laws, a half  sister-in-law I guess you would say   I had three half-brothers, and the  5  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  wife of one of them. I was in Arabia. My sister got in contact with me  and I was able to produce the cash that was needed for the transaction  and we   my mother, my sister, my brother and I, pooled our interests  and we were able to buy the farm without having a sheriff   s sale   auction  or something like that. Then, I bought or paid my mother, my  sister, and my brother the amount that they were due from the  inheritance. And so I got the farm in 1959.  And you   ve had it ever since.  Yes.  So you actually grew up on the farm.  I gave my mother a life estate until her death in 1964. From then on it  has been mine. And it is a pretty productive farm and farmland.  And it   s used for wheat or cattle or what?  Since I   ve had it, it has been almost exclusively in wheat. Or some  alfalfa. It hasn   t been alfalfa for some time. The people up around  Marshall are all wheat farmers and very few have the equipment  necessary to work with alfalfa. And there are very few people any more  that   I guess they contract out small jobs in alfalfa. So yes, it   s been in  wheat.  You lease the whole thing to one person?  Yes.  How many acres?  Originally, the farm was 153. It is on the correction line, they call it, and  these other farms along here are less than 160 acres.  We were curious about that.  Highway 51 has been put in right along here. Here would be the  correction line, this is Highway 51 and Highway 51, in two bites, has  taken seven acres. The first time they built Highway 51 they took about  four acres and about an acre of it is off the corner of what we always  called the Blackjacks. This is kind of a timbered hill. Then, last year or a  little over a year ago, they wanted 3.34 more acres. The bridge has been  built on Otter Creek just recently and the road still is not in its final state.  They   re working on the road. We   ve lost seven acres to the state for  ODOT  Oklahoma Department of Transportation .  6  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  It had a water source then, if it   s crossed by Otter Creek.  Yes, this is the creek running along here.  On the original piece of land, what were some of the buildings that were  there?  Well, in the beginning, my father, my uncle, and my grandfather spent  the winter of 1889 in a dugout at. This is a sketch of that little patch up  there, the Blackjacks, and the dugout was down here at the end of this.  There was a good spring to get water right about where the edge of your  hand is on the other farm that joined it on the west. They built a small  house right about here in the Blackjacks and had a well drilled. In the  spring my grandmother and two aunts came down. They lived there  until, I guess, they married and moved away. My grandmother lived  there until 1911, although her older daughter had moved to Washington  State and my grandmother had gone out there and visited her. But she  came back and lived in that house until 1911.  And my father married, I really don   t know exactly what year. He was  born in 1870 and so it had to be before 1900, I   ve got it written down  somewhere. He married and they built a house down close to the creek  so their livestock could be close to water. They had a dug well there and  that   s where I was raised, in the house right down here. It was a white  house with a green trim. We had a large red barn with a cupola on top  where the pigeons inhabited. The barn had stalls for four teams of horses  and had three granaries along the west side and a hay loft in which the  tradition was that they had barn dances. This was my father and his first  wife. They had three sons and one daughter. She died in 1915.  My mother was a school teacher. She was born in the little town of New  Almelo, Kansas out in northwest Kansas and at about eight years of age,  they moved to Missouri. There was a drought in Kansas at that time and  the mother and her children went to Mansfield, Missouri by train. I  guess they had to go to Norton, Kansas to catch the train. But anyhow,  they got to Mansfield, Missouri. My grandfather had bought 40 acres  sight unseen and their plan was they were going to raise apples. They  lived there for approximately one year and they had no more luck  stirring rocks in Missouri than they did stirring sand in Kansas. So they  sold the farm to Laura Ingalls Wilder and her husband. I   ve got the deed  to prove it. They came by covered wagon from Missouri to up near  Marshall, Oklahoma. The plan was that they were moving to Texas, but  my mother (she was ten years of age at that time) said that my  grandmother and grandfather were up all night arguing about what they  were going to do. They had come from Missouri in a period of drought  also, having to buy water along the way for the livestock they had if they  7  Finchum  didn   t come to a stream. Grandma said that she was staying on Otter  Creek. It was a little spring-fed stream that led into Otter Creek there.  And so they built a   although my grandfather was a woodsman, he was  a Canadian-born Irishman but he had come to the United States and  worked in Wisconsin as a lumberjack in the lumber industry. But they  built a sod house and that   s where they lived for several years. The piece  of property that they were on was school land, they called it. And later  on they had an opportunity to buy that school land, which they did for   1,600 and then they built a large house that I remember as a little kid  when we used to go and visit Grandma. My mother went to school at a  place called Sunny Side, which was a sod school building and I have a  picture of that with weeds growing on the roof. (Laughter) A male  teacher with a beard and she evidently was a good student and after  finishing the eighth grade   and she was probably older because of the  interruptions in school. Instead of the normal 14 she might have been  closer to 16 or something like that. But after graduating from eighth  grade there, she was sent to Oshkosh, Wisconsin and lived with her  father   s sisters. Her father had several sisters. I   ve got the names  somewhere. I think there were about five of them. They were all  teachers, or most of them. I think two of them married but the rest of  them were always old maids.  And they say in those days that wasn   t unusual, that a teacher   s   students  were her family. She was there until she was 19. She came  back and taught rural one-room eight-grade schools for 13 years. My  father   s first wife had died. My mother was teaching my father   s  children. So they met and they married in 1915 or    16. She was 32 and  he was 46. My sister was born in 1918 and I was born in 1921 and a  younger brother in 1923. So that was our family.  Our half-brothers all lived in the general vicinity or general area when I  was growing up. Two of them were farmers and one, the eldest, worked  in the oilfield, Shell Refinery or gas plant at Roxana. Then they moved  and worked in the Lucien field. My half-sister was, I think, 16 when I  was born or maybe 18, maybe 16 when my sister was born. I can  remember when she got married. At the time I didn   t know what was  going on, but I can remember standing on the cellar door down here  waving goodbye to a car that was going. My half-sister and her husband  were going towards Colorado. Later they went to California. I   ve about  exhausted that part of the family.  So when you were young, like eight to ten years old, and you were living  on the farm, did you have particular chores that you were responsible  for?  8  Ahrnsbrak  Yes. Well I went into the Army while I was still 18. I had joined the  National Guard at Perry  Oklahoma . A couple other people from  school, including one of the school teachers, had joined the Guard. On  September the 16th, just ahead of my 19th birthday, we were federalized.  That is, we went into the 45th Division and into the Army at Fort Sill.  But back to your question, my father died when I was 14, or I wasn   t  quite 14. Let   s see, he died in    36, yeah I was 14. I was, we   ll say, the  man of the family. We didn   t have much to farm with. My brother and I  did farm. By that we mowed, raked, didn   t bale but put loose alfalfa into  the hay loft, which was quite a job for a couple kids. We milked cows  and fed hogs and we had a pretty good sized flock of sheep.  Going back to another story about when I was a kid, it   s hard to believe  now, along Otter Creek it is a regular jungle. But when I was a kid we  had sheep. The farm along the creek was almost like a city park. We had  enough sheep that all the weeds were down and the grass was low.  Green briars had been killed out. You could drive an automobile inside  the fence all the way down to the area right here where there was an oak  grove that was used for Fourth of July celebrations  and  even a  wedding. There   s an article in this book about,    There   s not going to be  a celebration in Mulhall this year but there will be one on Frank  Ahrnsbrak   s farm.    Right there.  The guys who were ten years older than I, who lived around here, could  remember some of these events. I remember that one time, this was after  my father   s death, we had a croquet court down there. We still had the  sheep and a bunch of kids were going to have something, we put up a  croquet court. The neighbor boy next door had the set.  After my father   s death, the only income my mother had was income  from the farm and in a good year, it was okay. In a bad year, it wasn   t  very good. She took advantage of the new Farm Security Administration  offerings. She got a loan from Farm Security here in Guthrie and bought  farm machinery, a tractor, a power take-off mower, I   m not sure if she  had a rake, and upgraded the cattle. My dad would milk as much as was  needed for the house when he was living but he wasn   t interested in  being any sort of a dairy man. But my mother, we   ll say, took care of us  by income from cream and eggs. She had a big bunch of laying chickens  and every Saturday we sold cream and eggs in Marshall. So we did  okay.  The house had two screened in porches. Quite large porches, one along  the north and one along the south side of the house. And when my dad  was living, during the winter the north porch always had a hind quarter  of beef hanging in it. We had a smokehouse and then we had smoked  9  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  hams and shoulders and I know we had bacon. I   m not sure we had lamb  every year. My dad hated to kill a lamb or butcher one. But we had beef,  pork, lamb, chickens. Of course, we had guineas as watch dogs. The  house had a double lane of cedar trees up north of the house and then a  pathway in between that led out to the road and the guineas roosted in  those trees. And they are really watch dogs.  They make a lot of noise, don   t they?  Yeah. They were quiet unless some stranger came and then they   d really  let you know.  If you had a smokehouse, did your mother do a lot of canning with fruits  and vegetables and things?  Yes, she did. One of the things that I remember is beef that she canned.  It   s what would have been put into a good roast nowadays and she cut it  into sort of cubes, like one inch cubes. She canned this beef and I still  remember it as one of the things I really liked.  She had a reputation, I think subject maybe to her mother   s reputation,  my grandmother   s, of making the best bread in the country. It was  sourdough bread, evidently. They used what was called an everlasting  yeast. She would make these loaves of bread and they would swell up  and then be baked. We had our first family reunion in about 1983 or    84  and I have a cousin who lives in Pennsylvania. She   s, I guess, two years  older than I am, and she came to that reunion. One of the first things she  talked about was my mother   s bread. And about every fourth time she  made it, I think my dad had the recipe for that, they made what they call  K  chen or kuchen. It was made with the same bread dough, but more  sugar in it and cinnamon and what have you. It was a coffee cake.  Smelled good, I   d say.  Yeah. And around Crescent  Oklahoma  in those days   Crescent was  the fruit area. Peaches, grapes, I guess apples   we had an apple orchard  too, when I was a kid. But by that time the trees were mostly old and  they didn   t last very long. But every year we would go to Crescent and  buy grapes and peaches and then my mother would can those. I haven   t  told you about the flood.  No, let   s hear about the flood.  In 1932, I was almost eleven, I was still ten when it was on August the  10th, 1932. I wrote something about this and I said August the 16th but I  had learned in watching Ross Dixon with the news report that it had to  10  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  be August the 10th. They had nine inches or more of rain on the  watershed of Otter Creek in a period of 12 hours or less. And when our  dad got us up in the morning, the creek was running through the  driveway of the barn, which was almost at the same level as the house.  He sent me with Johnnie to drive or lead the sheep up to the Blackjacks,  which we did. Then, a short time later the creek jumped the bank at a  curve north and started flowing across the farm. And so he sent my  mother and my sister out and my sister lost one of her shoes in the mud  by the time they got out.  He stayed in the house and he lifted everything that he could lift and put  it chair-bottom height. That was as high as he could lift. That   s the only  thing he had to put stuff on. He lifted just about everything except the  piano and he waited too long to get the car out. Then he came out. And  I   ll say that by 8 o   clock he was up on the side of the hill with us and the  creek, or flood, was probably at its maximum, and by 6 o   clock in the  evening it had gone down such that we were back in the house. My job  was I had a hoe and I was scraping mud out of the house. That year,  wheat was 29 cents a bushel. My dad was not ordinarily a wheat farmer,  he liked to try to raise corn which was not a very productive thing to do  in those  years of drought . But he had 50 acres of wheat, made 20  bushels to the acre. Everyone thought he was a liar but he had a  thousand bushels of wheat in the barn. The flood got it wet, broke the  side out of the barn.  It expands when it gets wet?  Had to be dug out with a pick, the bottom of it had to be dug out with a  pick. It wasn   t even worth hog feed. We had a dug well. In my  imagination it was pretty big, probably four or five feet but to me it  seems like it was six or eight feet in diameter. Rock walls around it. It  was probably no more than 20 feet deep but it had good fresh water and  it had caved in. On the north porch we had a cistern. My mother liked  cistern water. She had long black wavy hair and she liked to wash her  hair in the cistern water. The cistern had been topped off with  floodwater. All her canned goods were kept in a storm cellar and had  shelves all along both sides, and, of course, the cellar was full of water.  But the canned goods were all sealed and I guess they were okay. That  was quite an experience.  That was the early    30s?     32.  The Depression was getting ready to start.  11  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Yeah. And then by either    34 or    35, the creek was bone dry. There  wasn   t a drop of water in the creek on our farm or the farm north or the  farm south. Because I was a kid who roamed that area at that time. And  my dad   well, Mike knows where the deepest place on the farm is to  fish because you can catch some big fish there. But in the place where  the last of the water disappeared, my dad dug a hole about, oh, we   ll say  probably as long as this coffee table and maybe twice as wide. It was a  terrible thing to dig because it turned out to be clay, but it filled with  water and furnished water for the livestock. But the year my dad died,  1936, my eldest half-brother brought us water in 55-gallon drums, water  for domestic use to drink and to cook with. He did that for probably two  or three months then, we got a well drilled.  It did rain before my dad died. I had a dog named Brownie and the creek  had gotten water in it and my brother and I and another guy went  swimming on a place north of our farm. When we walked back there  was a rattlesnake alongside a log. I can remember my younger brother  stepping over that and I saw the snake after he stepped over it. The snake  didn   t bite him because he didn   t bother it or anything. But the dog saw  the snake and the snake went into a little brush pile there and the dog  went after it and he was bitten and the dog died from the snakebite.  There were no vets or anything around the little town of Marshall.  Anyhow, my dog died. I don   t think I have a picture of him, but  somewhere I have a picture of his mother. We had a little fox terrier,  female, and every year she presented us with a new set of puppies. And  Brownie was one of those.  When your father was farming sheep, did he shear them?  Yeah, he was a pretty good veterinarian or what have you. Once in a  while he wacked the skin of a sheep, but he was the one who sheared  them.  And he produced them for their wool? Or did he sell them for     Well, he sold sheep, but we maintained just a certain level of sheep. And  so the ewes, we would only have, we   ll say, one buck so there   d be  basically all the ewes. They   re like deer, they give birth to either one or  two. About half of them give birth to twins. So we would have lots of  sheep, lots of lambs. So they sold lambs and would sell the wool. It  never occurred to me, but I don   t think wool was that valuable. But also  he kept them because they kept weeds down and what have you. We  didn   t have any cockleburs or anything like that on our farm.  That   s saying a lot.  12  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Yeah.  How would he get the sheep to market?  Well, just like the wool I suppose someone came and bought them. That  used to be the case with cattle, too. I can remember a man named   to  me he was Mr. Murphy. Mr. Murphy was a cattle buyer and he would  come to the country and buy cattle, so there was probably someone who  bought sheep. We still maintained the sheep after my dad died and I  became, in a crude way, the veterinarian in bobbing tails and doing that  sort of stuff. A man came and showed me how to do it. I can   t imagine  how my mother managed to take care of us and our dad. He was in the  hospital in Oklahoma City for a period of time, a short period of time,  and I don   t remember how many months he was at home. I don   t know  how she managed the farm, fed us, took care of him, and what have you  but she did.  Did she have to hire help?  No, I don   t think we ever had to. We had, like I say, I was working and  my sister was pushing 17 and I think we did it pretty much by ourselves  except for the half-brother bringing water when it was absolutely  essential.  Where did you go to elementary school?  Pleasant Ridge. (Laughs) Pleasant Ridge was where my mother was  teaching my dad   s children. It was a little country school, a mile and a  half west and a mile south of our home. I went there for first, second,  and third grades. It   s one of the few places where I remember my  teacher   s names. First and second grade was Mrs. Zahl and third grade  was Miss Lash. Our dad took us to school every morning but weather  permitting, we walked home. My sister always said she was three years  older than I was. In school she was actually three years ahead of me. For  two years during  the  school term when she was small, they thought she  was too small to be wandering around on the country roads alone so  during school term we, Mother and the kids, moved into Marshall. I can  remember that.  She entered school in second grade.  When she was in  second grade, we lived in what we called the green house because it was  painted green. And the second year we lived in the brown house. I   ve  shown Pat where those houses were. We had an aunt, my father   s  younger sister, youngest sister or younger I should say because the other  sister was older, lived right across the street from the green house. When  I was old enough to go to school, then she and I went to Pleasant Ridge.  We went there for three years.  13  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Then, when I was in fourth grade, Pleasant Ridge was consolidated into  the Marshall system and a school bus ran. Theoretically, we were  supposed to meet the school bus at the northwest corner of the farm. Our  house was down here, we were supposed to walk up there. And we did  part of the time, but if the weather was bad, the driver would come down  and turn around in our yard and then we   d go. There were kids from  over in this part of the country that walked over and caught that school  bus to go to Marshall. I had a half-nephew I call him, my middle half-brother   s  son, who walked about as far as Abraham Lincoln did to go to  school one year. He only went to Marshall one year but he walked from  a place, by road it would have been if he had to walk up to the top of the  hill, it would have been three and a half miles one way.  And in 1932, the bridge on what is now 51 washed out. There was a  short period there where you didn   t go east without going around the  section. I can remember all the men in the area and probably the county  engineer or something like that coming down. They built fires and then  heated these iron pieces, the ones that had been bent, and straightened  them by having a team of horses on each end and pulling them around  trees. They rebuilt that bridge, but then a few years later, and I don   t  remember exactly what year it was, maybe   it was after my dad died,  maybe about 1937, the bridge fell in. They said it fell in right behind a  truck that was hauling horses. The guy driving the truck said that he felt  the rear wheels climb up on the approach to the bridge as the bridge  behind him fell. Then that bridge was out until they built Highway 51.  When I was in college, in order to get home, out here about two miles  east, I had to go a mile north and then two miles or three miles west and  then back south and then back east to the house. There was no bridge  there for years. Pat and I were up in that country not long ago and the  bridges that I knew two miles south and a mile north, they   re no longer  there. So the reason why ODOT wanted this acreage from the farm is  there is no reasonable detour for Highway 51. It had many miles to get  around. And what bridges there are still on Otter Creek around there  wouldn   t support today   s traffic. They left the old bridge in service  while they are building the new bridge, which they built right south of  the old one. Now they   ve torn the old one out and if we go up there, you  can see that.  Is the old farmhouse still there?  No. We had renters there until   well the house was there until after    79  I know, but a renter had moved off a few years before. The house  became a habitat for barn swallows, which I like, and snakes and rats. So  my sister and I and her husband went up there one day and we waited  until after the barn swallows had nested and flown away and we burned  14  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  the place. I took some of the trim lumber out of it, which I still have, but  have had no use for it really. I don   t know why I took it out but I did.  But anyhow, we burned it and then I had the old foundation buried. The  highway where they   ve taken the land now, I think it would   ve taken the  north end of the house and it   s very close to the barn. The old barn has  been taken down, too. No, there   s nothing there. There   s a little erosion  that I   m going to have fixed and when they fix it I   m going to have the  old foundation of the barn buried so there won   t be anything there. And  up on the hill there   s nothing but the remains of a little root cellar that  they had and it   s got a big tree growing out of the middle. The old well  is still there, the casing of the well. It   s got a rock over the top of it. The  dugout was used by my dad as a dump for my mother   s cold cream jars  and stuff like that.  Since we   re talking about the house, tell me a little bit more about it.  Was it two stories?  No. It was three bedroom, one story. As originally built, it had been built  for my father and his first wife. And for the time it was sort of a pretty  stylish little thing. And  it was  just really two rooms but they were quite  large and had a bay window on the north end. I think they had lived as  people used to live, in very close quarters. When their first two sons  were born I think my father and his wife and my father   s mother, my  grandmother, lived in the house up on the hill. I think my two older half-brothers  were born up there. But then they built the house down by the  creek. Then, there was another little house that they brought down and  attached to it. It furnished a bedroom and a large walk-in closet. When  it was up on the hill, I think that it had been sort of a little kitchen area.  Then my grandmother   s house was brought down and it was attached to  it and basically that was the big dining room we had. The dining room  was the most important room in the house when we were kids. I didn   t  like the living room because that had the piano and I had to take piano  lessons. (Laughter)  When my mother and father married my dad bought a livery stable that  was going out of business in Marshall. They built on another wing or  end of the house and that furnished a pretty good sized kitchen and the  bedroom for my brother and myself. So it was three bedrooms, it had a  large dining room, a living room, and a large closet. When I was real  small, we had between my mother   s and father   s bedroom and my  sister   s bedroom, there was a long narrow closet. You know, it was like  sort of a secret passage but it had clothes hanging everywhere.  How was it heated?  With wood. They had a potbelly stove in the dining room. The kitchen  15  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  had a big, what they called, Majestic range, the wood-burning cook  stove that had a place on one end where you could heat water and I think  room for about four pots to sit on the other part. Originally the living  room also had a potbelly stove but later on they had a kerosene-burning  portable stove. Also, in the kitchen, in addition to the woodstove, there  was a kerosene-burning kitchen stove to keep down the heat in the  summertime. The kitchen was on the west end of the house which got  the sun so they had the kerosene stove because it didn   t put out the heat  that the woodstove did. My mother   s baking, practically everything that  she did that I remember, like making the bread and baking a turkey and  all that sort of stuff, was on the woodstove. I think they did have a little  temperature gauge on the stove. That was a real art to be able to cook on  those things, seems to me.  During the winter did your bedroom stay warm enough?  I   m sure it would   ve been cool in the bedroom, probably even worse. I  can remember when there was ice on the inside of the windows in the  dining room. The dining room stove was in one corner  of the room, so  during the night when the fire was low  it got pretty cold. But we were  used to it and it didn   t bother me. It wasn   t any worse than Fort Sill.  When we went into the Army that first winter at Fort Sill   today it   s just  unimaginable that they would put people in the conditions which we  lived. The people at Guantanamo are living in a, what do they call it?  Holiday Inn Express luxury suite. We lived in tents that were set on a  concrete floor. They had a little thing they called a Sibley stove, stood  about that high. It was like an inverted funnel, had a little opening on  one side that you were supposed to stick sticks in and burn, and a  chimney that ran out the top. If you did build a fire and a spark went out  and it landed on the tent, you could look up and you could see a hole just  getting bigger and bigger and bigger as it burned holes in the canvas.  The bathroom, or latrine they called it, was, well from one end of the  battery street, it was farther than from here to across the road, and  through mud. Anyhow, we moved to Abilene, Texas, Camp Barkley,  Abilene and we lived in tents there, too. But they had wooden floors and  we had a natural gas heat so it was great in Abilene compared to Fort  Sill.  And this was the early    40s?  I spent the winter of 1940 in Fort Sill from September the 16th until  sometime in March of 1941. And March of 1941 we went to Abilene  and we were there for 14 months. And in those days, you had to be 21 in  order to apply for Officer Candidate   s School, but you could apply for  aviation cadet. I had applied for and taken the test for aviation cadet.  They had recently reduced the rules. It used to be that you had to have  16  two years of college education to apply, but they reduced it to if you  could pass the test you could go with high school. So I passed the test  and I spent the bulk of my career bouncing from one place to another  here in the United States during World War II. When the 45th Division  was sent to a port of embarkation, up in New York, I think it was (I   ve  forgotten the name of the place they went). I was transferred to another  outfit in Abilene for a short while and I was known as a potential cadet.  And then I went to Waco, Texas and was there for a number of months  and I got a good job and extra pay by becoming a permanent KP, kitchen  policeman. I   d never served KP at Fort Sill or anywhere.  Oh, going back a moment, when we were federalized in September  1940, I was a corporal. I had been promoted corporal of Battery C, 158th  Field Artillery. Because I was the man of the family, my mother  could   ve gotten me off my duty but the old captain of the outfit told my  mother   she went to Perry with me, told her that there I was a corporal  making  42 a month and if I didn   t go then I would shortly be drafted  and go in at  21 a month. It was a good deal that I go in. So I went in as  corporal.  That   s getting back to where I was earlier. We were at Waco for awhile  and then I was sent, along with a number of other people, to Camp  Maximiliano Luna, which was the highest altitude camp at the United  States at that time, they told us. It was at Las Vegas, New Mexico. Not  Nevada. We were there to teach air crew members the manly art of self-defense  because we   d been through basic training. We were there for a  few months and finally got called to Kelly Field at San Antonio. I went  to San Antonio and somehow or other I arrived there about three days  late. I was behind on learning Morse code. I know I had to spend extra  hours, I had to catch up. I remember having this headset on and ding-ding-  ding-ding-ding-ding-ding. For the first two or three hours I  couldn   t tell a dot from a dash for anything. But I finally got it and went  through pre-flight at San Antonio.  Went to Bonham, Texas in primary and flew a little Fairchild, I think it  was, plywood airplane. I think the record would show that I was  considered a hot pilot and I even got away with crossing the Tee-line,  which is a forbidden thing. We were practicing power landings coming  in low and fast and as I was coming in, I don   t know why they also had  people flying more or less dead-stick landings coming in at about 500  feet, having the engine on idle and just floating down. This plane was  coming in from my right and floating down and I sensed that we were  going to have a collision if I continued, so I turned left and went across  Tee-line and came back around and by that time I could land. The  officers had seen this and they evidently agreed with me that had I  continued we would probably have had a collision because they asked  17  me if I didn   t think I could   ve given it more power and gotten under it  and I said I didn   t think so, so anyhow I got away with that.  And then I went to the second level of flying and the first day that I flew  we flew the BT-13, which was a much bigger plane than the thing we   d  had in primary. When you taxied down the runway or anywhere it  sounded like you were dragging sheet metal behind you, I remember  that. But the regular instructor was gone and I went with a test pilot and  he took me up to about 8,000 feet and turned the plane upside down and  said it was mine. I did manage to come out so we flew around for a day  or two and then my regular teacher, a second lieutenant, I remember his  name and he may be gone now so I   ll name him, his name was Bell,  Lieutenant Bell. When we walked out toward the airplane, I thought I  asked him an intelligent question about the plane and his answer was,     When you   re walking with me, your position is one pace to the left and  one pace to the rear.    That was the way he answered my question. I was  a rather hot-headed young individual at that time and we didn   t get along  too well from then on.  The last time I flew with him, when I went out to get into the plane,  another fellow named Allen was getting out of the plane and he told that  lieutenant,    If you don   t think I can fly with you, I don   t want to fly with  anybody. You can take the Air Force and stuff it.    You know. So I got in  the plane and this guy, the pilot, he was mad obviously and he rapped  me across the knees with the joystick. I took that and we flew around a  little bit and I was about ready to solo. I think he considered having me  solo. He did compliment me when we came in, he let me land the plane  in a strong cross-wind and he complimented me on the landing. But  when we got down he told me to write 25 times or 50 times something  on the board that I will not do something I had not done. I wrote it four  or five times and said,    To hell with it.    And I went in and saw the  commandant of cadets and told him I wouldn   t fly with that guy. There  was a rumor around at that time anyhow that the Army was going to take  a lot of the   or the Air Corps, well it was the Army Air Force at that  time, that they were going to take a lot of the pilots and make glider  pilots out of them. So I said I wanted to be a navigator. I told him that if  I couldn   t be a navigator or if I couldn   t have another instructor I wanted  to go back to the field artillery from which I had come. So I stayed in, I  guess they called it basic, primary and basic, basic. I stayed at Sherman,  Texas I went to ground school every day but I did not fly. But I stayed  there until everybody who graduated, graduated.  And then I was sent to the field artillery. Boy, that was a mistake. The  outfit I had joined was nothing like what I had left with the guys out of  Perry. But anyhow, I wanted to go back to field artillery because I was  going to apply for Officer   s Training School and I did. The old captain,  18  Finchum  Nykolaiszyn  Ahrnsbrak  and I remember his name, it was Stein, Captain Stein, told me I didn   t  stand a chance, that he had a staff sergeant there who had applied and he  didn   t make it. I thought that was one of the biggest insults I ever had  considering what I had thought of this staff sergeant.  And so I got my interview and while I was there in Sherman, Texas I  had read quite a lot and I had a very good teacher in high school, English  teacher, who introduced us to a lot of literature and poetry and all that  sort of stuff. And miraculously the board of three officers, when they  started asking me questions, well the guy asking me questions, I think he  was a lieutenant colonel, started out on literature, asking who wrote this  book, who wrote that book, something like this and what have you. He  got around to the point where he asked,    Who wrote The Chambered  Nautilus? I couldn   t remember and he started to recite it, he said,    Build  thee more stately mansions,    the last stanza anyhow. And I said,    I know  the poem, but I can   t think who wrote it.    He said,    Say it.    So I did. I  recited the last stanza and he said,    Son, not one boy in a thousand  would know that.     And so I got into Officer Candidates School and went to Camp Davis,  Wilmington, North Carolina. I got out of school in August, I think  August the 19th, 1943. Because of unique qualification (that is an Army  joke). My last name began with the letter A. I was actually assigned to a  unit at Riverside, California and the camp was full of officers from anti-aircraft  artillery that did not have an assignment. They were all excess. I  was there for several months. Then, the Army did what we call re-treading  of aircraft artillery officers and tank destroyer officers and what  have you into infantry. So we went to a four-week school at Fort  Benning, Georgia. And then I was sent to Camp Blanding, Florida. I was  an instructor in an infantry replacement training center for two classes,  two 13-week classes of people. We have certainly gotten off the farm,  haven   t we?  You   re doing fine though.  Well, what happened while you were in the service, what was going on  with the farm?  Well, as I said, I gave my mother a life estate and so she rented it out.  She had a number of renters but the one that was there most of the time  was a fellow who had also gone to school with me. He was older than I  was. I think he was a couple years older than my sister. He had been a  neighbor boy and they lived there. So they lived there through my  mother   s death. In fact my mother died in 1964 and that fellow stayed  there and lived on the farm most of time. He operated the farm until he  died in 1979. Then, I got another renter who has been there since then.  19  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  That   s pretty good.  But going back to  the military . After being there for two of these 13-  week classes my number finally came up and I was sent to a port of  embarkation somewhere in upstate New York. Never saw so much snow  in my life. It was in the latter part of November of 1944. And yet again,  due to unique qualification, I went with a number of guys to the ship that  we were going to cross the Atlantic on and it turned out to be the Queen  Elizabeth. We went on the ship for a day or two, I think it was a couple  of days, to learn different positions on the ship where our troops were  going to be. Then, the troops came aboard and I always say that being a  commissioned officer I was assigned   that they were down in the hold  in places with hammocks all around the walls and what have you. I was  assigned quarters in a luxury cabin for two complete with tub bath. I had  13 roommates. 14 of us, so we lived in hammocks too, along the side.  And each one of us had to spend four hours a day down with our  company.  I had Company A and I spent four hours down in the hold and my job  was to censor their letters that they were writing to their wives and  girlfriends and so forth and so on, which I didn   t think was really  necessary but it was something we had to do. In case we were torpedoed  or something, I was supposed to get them up and come up. We crossed  the Atlantic in terrible weather. The Queen Elizabeth was long enough  that it didn   t pitch. It was long enough that the waves running under it  didn   t bother it but it rolled. It would roll over on its side and shudder as  the gyroscopes took over, and then it   d come over and roll on the other.  People were sick everywhere. I never got sick but the first night we went  down I couldn   t face my meal. But from then on, I ate it.  We landed at Glasgow and took a train from there through London. As  we went through London, the women came out and gave everybody   at  least everybody that I knew   a little meat pie. Then, we went to South  Hampton and boarded a channel steamer called the Leopoldville and  went from South Hampton to Le Havre. And from Le Havre we spent a  couple days there and then went to a place called Givet, G-I-V-E-T,  France, protrudes up into Belgium. And from there we went by truck to  Germany. I joined the 104th Infantry Division as a rifle platoon leader,  the shortest lived career in the Army. But again, miraculously, when the  three of us, three second lieutenants joined this outfit, and when the  colonel came out to tell us where we were going to be assigned, he asked  if anyone had artillery experience. I had two and a half years in the  instrument section of field artillery and had a commission in the aircraft  artillery. The captain of  the  canon company had been killed a couple  days before so I became a forward observer, which is a lot better than  being a rifle platoon leader. So that was my job through the remainder of  20  Finchum  the war, as an artillery observer. I went with the infantry but I didn   t  have to kick down doors and that sort of stuff. And didn   t get a scratch. I  don   t think I left a drop of blood anywhere in Germany.  I came home, started school at OSU, went there for two years or the  equivalent of two years. I went one summer session there I think. But I  wanted to get a degree in Petroleum Engineering for some reason or  another and OSU did not offer it at that time so I transferred to OU.  OSU was a much better school in those days than OU was, that   s a fact.  OU, by the time I went there, there were so many veterans back that we  had huge classes and sometimes, honestly, you would have standing  room only if you didn   t get there in a hurry. They had quite a few  student instructors who were not that interested in instructing as they  were in, I think they got a little pay for being student instructors and  what have you. My intent, really, when I first came out was to get a  college degree and go back to the Army. Because when the Army broke  up in 1945, if you had a college degree, you could keep your  commission permanently. You could be regular Army if you wanted to  be. If you were like I was, a high school graduate, all they would  guarantee you was that you could stay in for 18 months. But I had more  or less grown up in the Army, and I liked it. But then I met my wife and  got married so didn   t go back.  I don   t know whether it still exists as a company or not, my first job was  with Thomas N. Berry and Company out of Stillwater. South of  Stillwater there   s this big old mansion, the Berry mansion. That   s where  the office was. I worked for them for about two years. And when I  graduated in 1949, it was like they say it is now, jobs were almost non-existent.  I had an uncle who was in the oil business and because of that I  got the job at Berry. But I applied in 1951 for foreign work, I wrote six  letters and got five jobs. But I selected one in Venezuela with a  subsidiary of Standard Oil of New Jersey, which is Exxon now, and  worked in Venezuela for ten months and then was transferred within the  same company to Colombia and was there for a little over three years.  Then went to Saudi Arabia and transferred again because Exxon owned  part of Arabian American Oil Company and worked there for 20 years  and then retired. So I   ve been retired    til I tire. (Laughter). Been retired  since 1976.   Then I went to the farm. My job was to go to the farm every day.  I  used to, when we first came back, I spent a lot of time up there with an  axe and a chainsaw and I finally learned that the brush was growing  faster than I could cut it down.  When you got of the Army and then went to Oklahoma A M, did you  live in Vet Village?  21  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  No. The first year I was there, that would   ve been, well it was on that  little thing I showed you about the gun, in the spring of 1946. I don   t  remember that there were any men   s dormitories, there may have been  but I   m not sure. I think there were two women   s dormitories. I think  there was Willard Hall and what was the name of the other one?  Murray? No, Murray was later.  Anyhow, Willard is the one near Theta Pond?  Right, yes.  Okay, I know Willard Hall was there.  And Murray   s across the street. Murray Hall is right across the street  from the pond.  Which direction? East, west, north?  West.  West? Well, it   s possible it was there. I think there were two women   s  dormitories. But anyhow, the first semester that I started school, I shared  a bed with another veteran, a sailor in a house just up a little north of  Stillwater National Bank, within just a block or two of there. That was a  common arrangement. A lot of people were doing that. I mean there  wasn   t any place to live.  And my younger brother, who had been in college, was drafted shortly  after I entered college. I   m not sure whether he got to finish his   it may  have been at the end of the first semester of 1946 that he had to go into  the Army. He had had a job as a fireman at Veteran   s Village out there  where that old water tower is out northwest. There was at that time right  near there, there was a one-story concrete block building and it was  heated by an open gas flame. There were, I believe, three guys that lived  there and had cots for beds. The one thing good about it was that being a  fireman you went down to the regular fire station, fire training station,  where it is there next to the Prairie Playhouse, and you got a noon meal  five days a week. They were really good meals. Funny, the one thing I  remember about them because I wasn   t used to it, it seemed like they  served a three-bean salad so frequently. Green bean, wax bean, and  some sort of other bean. But anyhow, we ate well one meal a day. So I  was a fireman there for at least a semester and then a guy I knew from  Enid, his dad built a little place out, you went west past Willard Hall    til  the road waved a little bit, turned a little bit. It was there. The neighbors  called it a chicken house. But it was a really nice little house. His name  22  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  was Hash. I lived there with Hash until I transferred to OU. At OU, I did  live in dorms such as they were. The first one was a converted Army  barrack of some sort. And then I moved into, I think it was called,  Thatcher Hall.  When you were at OAMC, did you go back and forth to home very often?  Yes I did. And it was like I said, during that time is when the bridge was  out and you had to drive around.  Did you have your own car?  Yes. I had a 1940 Ford. And I did go to the farm a good bit, but home,  where my mother was, was in Marshall at that time.  When did the farm get electricity?  It did not have electricity when I left in 1940 but it got it very shortly  thereafter. Because when I came home on leave to the farm my mother  and my brother had electricity. So it had electricity up until the time that  they left the farm. The electricity came in from the east and the  transformer there at the farm was the last one. The line did not go west  of there, it was another system. But yeah, that   s when they had  electricity. But when I was a kid it was kerosene lamp.  What about indoor plumbing?  No. No indoor plumbing. There wasn   t  any .  How did she do the laundry?  I can remember when they did it with a scrub board. But then they got a  washing machine of some sort.  If they didn   t have electricity   it had a crank?  Yeah.  Did she quilt?  A little. She did quite a lot of sewing.  Here   s something I remember, this little story right there. I asked my  brother who was two years younger if he remembered and he said he  did.  23  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  It   s a zeppelin going over. It   s a good story, too.  I recently found a copy that I had evidently cut out of the Guthrie paper  or possibly the Crescent paper at that time that talks about the Graf  zeppelin flying between Marshall and Crescent in 1928, August the 16th  I think it says or August the 26th. Our dad heard it and got us up to look  at it. I remember standing under an apple tree and seeing it fly over. I  don   t think it was very high at all, maybe 3,000 feet. What I remember is  you could see all the windows in the gondola. And in my imagination I  almost think that I can see people in those windows. My younger brother  said that what he remembers was the sound of the engines, but I don   t  really remember that.  Our dad had gotten us up one other time and that was to see  the   Northern Lights. I think a few years ago there was an incident where the  Northern Lights could be seen again here in Oklahoma. But anyhow, I  think that was earlier and I thought maybe I had dreamed that but I  asked my older sister and she confirmed that yeah, he got us up to see  the Northern Lights.  So he would   ve known about them through the newspaper? Or just word  of mouth, or radio? How would he have known that they were going to  happen?  He must   ve been up.  Did you have a radio?  Yes. Despite all the troubles of the Depression and what have you, we  were a relatively well-to-do family in the neighborhood. We had radio  and telephone. I don   t think we had a radio until another interesting  thing happened. My dad went to Crescent and bought a bird cage for a  canary and a 410-gauge shotgun. With that purchase he got some sort of  a ticket for a drawing they were going to have in Crescent. He won the  prize. It was a car. But a car such as seldom has been seen. It had bicycle  type wheels and had a little gasoline engine such as a Maytag washing  machine in those days might have had. You cranked it by lifting up the  right rear wheel and it had a handle on the wheel and you cranked the  wheel to crank the engine to get it to start. My brother and I were too  small to handle this little thing, but there were a couple older boys  named Van Hauen who came down. I remember riding with the older  boy, Wesley Van Hauen, going up the road in this thing. But it couldn   t  climb the hill, couldn   t get out of the valley.  My dad had an opportunity to trade that to a fellow in Crescent, his  name was McConnell. There was sort of an old mansion in Crescent that  24  Nykolaiszyn  Ahrnsbrak  Nykolaiszyn  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  was the McConnell house and this guy was selling radios. I believe that  he traded a radio and installed it and we even had a little pole with a  propeller on top of it and a generator to charge the battery. And the night  of the Dempsey-Tunney fight  September 22, 1927 , whenever that was.  You know who Jack Dempsey was? And Gene Tunney. The night of the  fight, the neighborhood men came in to listen to the fight on the radio at  our house. And this guy in Crescent, I think, was going to   I think he  built a little ramp over the front porch he had where his little car could  run down the ramp or run back up it. And he used it to go around and  service his clients. I think that   s where we got the radio.  But like I said, during the hard times of the Depression I was happy as a  clam. My sister, three years older, was a   I think girls were more  affected by the Depression than the boys were, really. I had a full belly  and a .22 rifle. I fished and played ball. But she had had a bank account  and the Marshall bank went broke and she lost her bank account. I have  no idea how much was in it. I   m sure there wasn   t much, not as much as  a hundred dollars, I   m sure. But anyhow, she was one who when she  accumulated some sort of wealth would never put anything anywhere  unless it was in a CD, a guaranteed fund. She wouldn   t think of buying  anything in the stock market. We were never hungry or anything like  that. I can remember that I think some of my classmates were hungry in  those days. Some of the ones who lived in the little town of Marshall  that their fathers had been sort of handymen or something like that, there  wasn   t anyone to hire them.  On the current farm property, what are the structures that exist today,  the newer structures?  Zilch.  Zilch, so it   s just land.  Well I furnished the money, but we had a beautiful fence between the  field and the creek and then we had   remember a few years ago we had  the bad ice storm? And trees fell on the fence and so my poor fence  doesn   t amount to much anymore.  Are there any ponds?  Yeah, a very small pond. I took advantage of the soil conservation  program that they had many years ago, I don   t know how many, 20, 25  years ago. I had a place that was eroding and they built one. And you  asked about the pond, back in the old days, I don   t know whether you  can still see them or not, over in the pasture there were at least three  what my dad called buffalo wallows. You know what a buffalo wallow  25  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  is? They   re over there. And I have found a few arrowheads. As a kid I  found a really nice one and it was a classical, what you always see in  drawings about the American Indians arrowhead. It   s not typical of what  they were, but it   s the one that comes down to a triangle and then has a  little short shank and then has sort of a base around it. You know what I  mean. That one my mother had in a china cabinet. Somehow or other at  the time of her death it disappeared, somebody got it. So I lost my good  arrowhead but I   ve got a few others. I   ve got a couple of rocks in here  I   ll show you, I   ll bring them in.  Back before the flood, I can remember east of the bridge the men were  working on the road, as they say, busting up sand rock because the  ground was kind of clay and they were hauling sand rock down and  breaking it up with the sledgehammers to put sand in the road. I was  probably seven, eight, or nine, something like that. I went down there  with my dad, he knew all the people. They were neighbors. Maybe  somebody from ODOT, if there was an ODOT at that time. I saw this  thing that was about to be broken up. I thought it was great and I   ve had  it ever since.  What do you think it is?  It   s just a natural concretion. I don   t think man ever worked on it. We  had a lady here comes to clean house and she was interested in the  profile but I   m sure it   s just     Wear and tear from the weather and the water.  Yeah, just natural. Now that is something that man has worked on, but  that   s from Arabia. That   s a petrified fern of some sort and it was a hand  axe that they would use to break bone to get to the marrow. I   ve got  hundreds of arrowheads from Arabia. I spent my first 15 years over there  chasing around after a little red ball playing golf. And the last five years  I got interested in archaeology. Arabia is going to be a   well it is  already, but it   s going to be a great archaeological place someday when  they really open it up.  What do you see the next hundred years being for the farm?  There are very few young folk going into farming. I don   t think any of  my present descendents, son, daughter, granddaughter, or grandson have  any interest in selling the farm, but I don   t know who there   s going to be  to run it. So I wouldn   t be surprised but what I think, like I said, it is a  productive farm. I don   t think that it will be allowed to remain idle. But I  think that probably there   s going to have to be some sort of a corporate  organization or the farm will be operated by some industrial complex of  26  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Nykolaiszyn  Ahrnsbrak  Nykolaiszyn  Ahrnsbrak  some sort. I think a lot of the land will be. There are so few young  people going into the farming business that I can   t imagine that there   s  going to be someone interested in running that one farm.  And as I was talking quite awhile ago about the school bus, if you take  the school bus route that I took as a kid and make the run there would be  nobody to pick up nowadays. Back when the land was first opened,  almost every quarter section had a family living on it. There were  exceptions, but with the school bus certainly every mile you picked up  somebody and usually it was every half mile. But now you could make  that run and there isn   t anybody there. Around the town of Marshall, the  land is owned by widows or old men. And the renter who farms my  place, his family owns a few farms and he farms about twelve or fifteen  hundred acres.  How much longer do you think he   ll be in the business?  Well, he   s not a young man anymore, either. He must be   well his  parents, I know them. They   re one year older than I am. So I   d say that  he is in his mid-sixties, at the youngest.  Not much longer, then.  Yeah. My sister who passed away a couple years ago, she was always  afraid that she was going to outlive her renter. But she didn   t, he   s still  around. But I don   t know how many are coming out, how many farmers,  young fellows, are coming out of Stillwater.  Do you know by any chance, I don   t know whether they call him doctor  or what, Jonathan Friend? He was a teacher in Stillwater. He was one of  my classmates.  A colleague has done an interview with him.  Oh, is that right? I had a letter from my brother just a couple days ago. It  said Jonathan died last November or something like that.  Right. We did the interview with him and then a couple days later he  passed away. It was so sudden.  No kidding?  He was with the College of Veterinary Medicine?  Yeah. Our English teacher, particularly when we were freshman and  sophomores, something like that, he would line us up around the room  27  Nykolaiszyn  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  and ask pop questions. Jonathan had the ability to remember dates.  Jonathan wasn   t known as an extremely bright student or anything like  that, but he knew dates. And someone told me, it wasn   t Jonathan, that  in Veterinary Medicine he was teaching something that had to do with  naming all the bones and all that sort of stuff with the animals. I don   t  know whether that   s true or not, but I can just imagine that Jonathan  would know the name of everything like that. The last time I saw him,  he and I attended   Marshall has a high school reunion every few years.  It was probably about two years ago, may have been three, and he and I  were the only two from our class who were there. He was telling me a  story about some bootleggers that were trying to extort money from his  father. We used to have a lot of bootleggers out on the creeks and  streams up there.  What about hobos? Did you ever run into any hobos?  Hobos? Well, we had a man in Marshall who used to, again when I was  a very small kid, he had harness lines. You know what harness lines are?  No.  Well, that   s leather straps that would lead, reigns they call them, we used  to call them lines. He had had harness lines tied all around his body  because the devil was trying to get part of him or something like that.  That was one guy.  Hobos. No, there was a family that lived about a mile east and they had a  son, he was much older than I was, like 30 years or so but he was not  terribly bright. And he was something of a hobo. I think he would  disappear for awhile and show up again. And I remember he came to our  house one time and wanted to ask my dad if he could sleep in the barn.  And my dad asked him if he had any tobacco and matches and he said,     No,    and so he let him sleep there.  We used to have people, salesmen, come through the country. I read  somewhere that an outfit like Dillard   s got started that way. They would  bring out a number of people and drop them off on a road, we   ll say  from our house they   d drop them off on a road a couple miles west and  they would drop off a person at every section line. And these guys  would walk through the country for four or five miles. That   s again  when there was a house on practically every quarter. They would go to  every house and they would have something to sell. Shirts, tea pots or  something like that. And there was a guy who came to our house   I  know why I said shirt because my dad bought a shirt. The fellow had  one that he displayed and it was kind of a denim shirt or something like  that, but that wasn   t the one he was selling. He had one that was  28  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Nykolaiszyn  Ahrnsbrak  Nykolaiszyn  Ahrnsbrak  Nykolaiszyn  wrapped or pinned or something like that and that was what was left. He  went on his way and when my parents unwrapped this shirt there was  something wrong with it. I don   t know what it was, whether it only had  one sleeve or something. But my dad jumped in the car and caught him  before he reached (laughs) his destination. And all I know is my dad  came back with his dollar or whatever it was (laughs) and the other shirt.  I remember we used to hear the doodle bug. The doodle bug was what  they called the train that ran from Oklahoma City to Kiowa, Kansas. It  was a one-car little train. Marshall had a train track that went through  but somehow or another the doodle bug had a different sound. Although  it was about four miles west, when the wind was right you could hear the  doodle bug and it had a regular schedule. I rode the thing one time when  I was in the Army. I rode from Marshall to Kiowa, Kansas and caught a  train to Riverside, California or to Los Angeles. The train was just full of  people. It was sleeping in the aisles. Another soldier and I and a female  soldier, either a WAC or a WAVE. I don   t think she was Navy. But we  sat in the area between two cars. I know I sat on my suitcase. Every seat  was taken and people were lying in the aisles. That was travel during the  war years.  I guess you were lucky to be on it.  Yeah. Yeah, I don   t why but I really enjoyed going up and working on  the farm. There is a lot of might be fairly valuable lumber growing up  there now in black walnut and pecan. Particularly some pecan trees that  have grown. They started out as saplings in the shade and they   ve grown  quite tall without any limbs, you know until they get clear up the top.  They   re not going to produce any pecans to speak of, but lumber. When  I was a kid we had only a few walnut trees but over the years the  squirrels buried the nuts and what have you and produced quite a few.  That grove I was talking about where they had the wedding it is an oak  grove, burr oak.  How did you meet your wife?  How   d I meet my wife? I was on my way to Camp Blanding, Florida, I  think. I met her at the bus station in Guthrie. She was 18 and   you   re  not familiar with Guthrie are you?  Only a little bit.  Do you know where what is now the Stables Restaurant is?  No.  29  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Nykolaiszyn  Ahrnsbrak  Okay, well the Stables Restaurant, back in the old day that building was  a livery stable and when I met my wife, one corner of it was the  Greyhound bus station. So I met her at the bus station and she gave me  her address and I wrote her and we wrote. And I think that was on my  way when I was going back to Blanding and then I went from Blanding  to Europe. So I wrote her while I was in Europe. And she was a nurse.  She went from high school into nurse   s training. I   ll show you a picture.  My grandfather and uncle both died of pneumonia before the five years  had run out and so my grandmother was the one who was given the  farm.  It is 1896. And the last name was spelled with an E. The last name had  an E on the end.  No, not actually. But it   s written that way several times. Because the   second syllable was  pronounced    brake    and people automatically put  an E on the end of it. I think one of the tombstones has the E.  Here are the only pictures I have of my dad. How about that? (Laughter)  That   s him with his older sister. And here he is as a fairly young fellow  and there he is as an old man. And here he is with my uncle.  Cowboys and their striped pants. Very nice.  Oh, this young man   s supposed to be putting some albums together but  it   s going very slowly.  So eventually you made it back to Oklahoma to marry her.  Yeah. My grandfather is a story. My grandfather came from Germany at  age seven with his parents, of course. And he was a soldier in the Union  Army and he was a deserter. As I understand it, or the story is, that he  could not stand the administration of one outfit he was in. Since they  were from Wisconsin it was probably a Wisconsin outfit. But he  deserted a Wisconsin outfit and joined I think it   s the 7th Minnesota  Volunteers under the name of Henry Steinbeck. So I have his promotion  to sergeant in Selma, Alabama. And I have his discharge and somehow  or other he was able to establish the fact that Henry Steinbeck was  indeed John Henry Ahrnsbrak and his widow, my grandmother, received  a  12 a month pension from his service. It is my understanding that not  only he, it was a common thing at that time, but the farm they had in  Iowa was service-related. It was a grant because of the service that  they   d given in the Union army. So they had this farm in Iowa. But since  he   d been in Alabama, he probably found it a lot warmer in Alabama  than he did in Iowa. (Laughter) And so he moved south.  30  Nykolaiszyn  Ahrnsbrak  Nykolaiszyn  Ahrnsbrak  Nykolaiszyn  Ahrnsbrak  Nykolaiszyn  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Well, I   m going to take you back to your wife. You were over in Europe  and you were writing back and forth. So eventually you came home?  When I came back from the war, Mary and I were a twosome my time in  college, in fact we got married in December of 1948 before I had  actually graduated from college. I didn   t graduate from college until  August of 1949. I went to work for T.N. Berry, we lived in Stillwater  and we bought a house in Stillwater. Our first house was 924 Stanley.  We were the first residents. I don   t know whether you know where  Stanley is, it   s a small little house that was on the corner. And we lived  there for   that   s where we lived when Pat was born.  So tell us about your shivaree.  Oh, the shivaree? That was not our shivaree. That   s my middle half-brother  and his family. When I was probably ten or twelve, a couple of  people, a little older than people usually are when they get married for  the first time, a guy named Earl Morris and Mary Johnson got married.  And anyhow, they were given a shivaree and I can remember I was  there. I didn   t know exactly what was going on or why it was going on,  but they were disturbing these people who had just gotten married.  That   s the only shivaree I ever attended.  So you did not get shivareed when you got married, you weren   t lucky  enough?  No. No, when we got married we went to New Orleans. And of all  things, one of the things we did in New Orleans was watch OU play  North Carolina for the National Championship, the Sugar Bowl. In those  days that was the Championship instead of the Orange Bowl. I told you  about the family reunions. The only picture we have of our honeymoon  is my wife on a little matchbox type thing that was taken at the  Roosevelt Hotel in New Orleans. How do you like that hat?  That   s a good looking hat.  That   s crossing the Atlantic on a ship. I don   t know whether that   s   we  went on the United States and we went on a Dutch ship and we went on  an Italian line, we went into Naples. My wife liked to ride on ships.  When I worked in South America, we rode the Grace Lines. In fact, I   ve  got the passenger list for one of them.   I almost got swept down the Magdalena River. I   ve had a great life.   Sounds like. But you always came back to Logan County.  31  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Ahrnsbrak  Finchum  Yeah. I don   t know why. Well no, I know. We bought a house in El  Paso, Texas. My wife really liked El Paso but her mother was here and  she was physically qualified for a nursing home but not mentally. So  actually we came back to Guthrie to buy a house and have a place for  her mother. We looked at several houses and this was one of those. So  we bought this place and her mother lived here with us for  awhile .  Grandma occupied the room back there. When we came from El Paso,  we had three Dobermans. One of them was with Pat. One Doberman  didn   t like Grandma. (Laughter) Grandma would come out of her  bedroom and this Doberman would like to   she was the runt of the litter  and she liked to lie where Grandma liked to sit. This dog would always  growl when Grandma came out. Never did bite her. She bit Jessica one  time, made a little mark on her cheek. She liked to lie under the edge of  that counter in there.   We had a cat  in El Paso. Mary Ann had a cousin,  Charles Albert,  he  was a teacher of special ed children. And he was really a great guy, but a  few of them were known in those days, he was gay. He could play the  piano    til the world went flat. And I don   t know where the cat came  from, but a cat showed up and Pat named it Charles Albert. Charles  Albert came up here along with the Dobermans and lived here till a ripe  old age. I think that   s the last indoor cat we had. Mary Ann said that she  either thought she did or she did in fact become allergic to cats. So since  then we   ve had nothing but dogs. Mary Ann was the world   s greatest  rescuer of dogs. Any stray dog anywhere, anyone that looked like it was  stray, she was willing to adopt. This was the last one she brought home.  That poor thing had been, I think, adopted by two different families and  they couldn   t stand her and they had taken her back to a vet somewhere.  Mary Ann happened to be there and she brought her home.  So what happened to the canary?  Well, my mother kept canaries. I don   t know. She had more than one  canary. Oh yeah, that   s typical. (Laughter) I   m practically destitute with  only two dogs now. (Laughter)  Is there anything else you want to get on tape before we sign off?  I don   t know what it would be unless you   ve got a question to ask.  No, we   ve covered quite a bit. And we appreciate your time.  Yes, we have.  It   s been interesting. So thank you.  32  Ahrnsbrak Thank you.  -------  -------
