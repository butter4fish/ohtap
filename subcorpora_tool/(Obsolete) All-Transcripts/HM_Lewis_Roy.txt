Speaker 1: Let's begin talking about your mother, starting with your mother's name, and where she was born and where she grew up as a girl.
Speaker 2: She was born in Adams County, probably in Natchez, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Her name?
Speaker 2: Her name is Elizabeth--Elizabeth Lewis--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --Elizabeth Saunders, then she married my father [Fritz Lewis, Jr.].  She was born probably 1914, something like that and she grew up in Natchez and then later, I think, moved out to the Adams County (unclear) country and where my--where, where she met my father.
Speaker 1: And did she ever share any stories with you about what life was like for her growing up as a girl in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, not really; I mean, I was pretty young when my mother died.  It's like, I was five, so--I mean I remember her, but stories, no.  I mean I remember her, but there were no--I don't remember any stories.  I mean I have an aunt that used--told me a few stories about some of the stuff that--she was her best friend, so--her name was Bobbie [ph.] Lewis and she was her best friend--one of her best friends, and so she kind of told me a few things but not her.
Speaker 1: What do you remember about your mother?
Speaker 2: I remember she was a, you know, beautiful, hard-working lady who, who worked very hard with seven children and who grew up in a pretty rough--on a plantation where I was born, and who, you know, sang in a choir, church choir, and did quilting and, you know, what a mother does for children on a-- in a rural situation in Mississippi on a farm.
Speaker 1: And how did she meet your father?
Speaker 2: I don't know, but I think probably at church, or probably at some social--I talked to my father about, and I think they probably met at church--yeah, the church in--just below Natchez in Adams County in Sibley, Mississippi; it's a little, small post office box kind of place, but they had a Mount Sinai Baptist Church [Natchez, Mississippi], and that's the church they went to; it could've been there or it could've been a social or something; I don't really know.
Story_ID: 227310
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit now about your father, starting with his name and where he was born and grew up as a boy.
Speaker 2: His name is Fritz Lewis [Jr.], and he was born within the same area, just below Sibley [Mississippi]--place close to Woodville, Mississippi, and he grew up in that area and--where they met, and he had about five or six--maybe six or seven brothers and sisters and, you know, they were farmers; his dad [Fritz Lewis, Sr.] was a farmer, and I think he had land--my father's daddy--they had land and, you know, some of his brothers and sisters migrated north and he stayed south along with a couple of his brothers, and his sisters went north, and they grew up--I was born on a plantation named Shieldsburg [ph.], which is like right off of--between the Mississippi River and a road called Highway 61 [U.S. Route 61], which is like--in Mississippi, that's really River Road.
Speaker 1: And did your father ever share any stories with you about what life was like for him as a boy growing up in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Well, rough--hard, you know--hard; him and his father didn't get along so well sometimes, and you, you--some of the things, you know--your horse, you know, was your main thing, you know, and to have a nice horse to ride or, later, cars, you know.  I mean, he worked on this plantation that, you know, they grew cotton and sugar cane, and I think they made syrup, you know, because I remember they used to have a mill that--where you ground the sugar cane and made syrup, and it was just, you know, season-to-season hard life, you know?
Story_ID: 227311
Speaker 1: And now did he [Lewis' father, Fritz Lewis, Jr.] and his family, they lived on a farm, or they lived on the plantation where you were born?
Speaker 2: They were on the plantation, Shieldsburg [ph.], and they, they did share--they were sharecroppers, and so they farmed and, you know, they had their--whoever owned the property they, you know, they got a portion of the farm at the end of the year, of the cotton or whichever it is they, you know, they harvested, and then there was some left for him and his family and I'm sure that--I was told also that he did go away sometime and work on a railroad--go to New Orleans [Louisiana] and work.  This is the '30s [1930s], you know--'30s [1930s], '40s [1940s].
Speaker 1: And did he ever talk about like what was involved in sharecropping like, you know, would they all get up very early in the morning, and did he ever talk about that whole (simultaneous) process?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Process?  Yeah; it's not--I mean I tried to get him to talk, but what I remember was that, you know, the--my brothers--I mean, I was the fifth child, so there's two under me but there were like the rest over me, so the older ones would, of course, you know, participate in the farming and working in the field and, you know, milking the cows and picking the cotton, harvesting--the whole bit.  And we--probably when I was about three, so that would be thirty--yeah, '39 [1939], '40 [1940], we moved to another plantation just a little further up the road, a Mazique [ph.] plantation; place, place called Oakland [Mississippi], which was owned by a black family--Maziques; it's a famous--Mazique family of Mississippi, Adams County [Mississippi].  And that's where--we were there for a year or two before my mother [Elizabeth Saunders Lewis] died; that's where she died.
Speaker 1: Why did the family move?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: I mean, maybe it was a--I don't know.  I mean, I'm three (laughter); I don't know.
Speaker 1: No, I just didn't know if there were ever any conversations about why--okay.
Speaker 2: No, I don't--I mean they moved maybe to do better, I don't know.  Maybe they got--maybe, you know, you moving from a farm plantation that's owned by some white Mississippian to a black Mississippian and, you know, that would probably say something there, and they knew the Maziques, you know, so--but I don't know what the particulars were.
Speaker 1: How would you describe your father?
Speaker 2: He was a hard worker, stern.  He'd grew up under, you know, some strict situations; used to sing in a quartet.  He was--he tried to take care of his responsibility and, you know, I think we--our relationship got better later, you know; during that period, you know, it was like his thirties, twenties--I mean the '30s [1930s], '40s [1940s]; it's rough, it's--the war [World War II, WWII] is going on, you know, and he was away a lot because he was working trying to supplement that sharecropper's salary, which meant my mother also had to participate in some of the work.
Story_ID: 227312
Speaker 1: And do you remember your mother's [Elizabeth Saunders Lewis] death?  Do you remember how you got word, and do you remember that at all?  Because you were still very young.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Yep.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about it a little bit?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she had tuberculosis and she--you know, bad health, and she had all seven of her children like really in a short period of time, and so she--you know, it just (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Had she been sick for a long time?
Speaker 2: I don't know that--for a long time; I would imagine because, you know, living conditions, you know, the houses weren't that, you know, like they weren't like the houses of today; these are like houses on plantations.  And I think she might have had problems with her chest, you know, like before, and--but having those children like, you know, like it's seven of us, and I think they were married about twelve years, so; you know, no twins.  But the work and living conditions and, during that time, you know?
Story_ID: 227313

Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: On both sides?
Speaker 2: Mostly my mother [Elizabeth Saunders Lewis].
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Can you tell us a little bit about them, starting with their names?
Speaker 2: James Saunders; he was my mother's father, and when my mother died, my two sisters and I went to live with them.  I had an interim; I went to live with my auntie who my mother sorta designated me to--her best friend, but after a year or so, I went to live with my other two sisters, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And did the other kids live with your father [Fritz Lewis, Jr.]?

Speaker 2: Right--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --right, basically.  Well, no, it was--yeah, the youngest--one of the boys stayed with my father and then my two sisters and I went to live with my grandfather.
Speaker 1: And what was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: My grandfather's name was James Saunders, and I'm tryin' to think of my grandma--Jute [ph.]; we called her Jute; she was not--she was my step-grandmother; she wasn't my mother's mother.  And I was talking to my sister today about it, and we could not get that name.  You know, when you don't have the records, it's not a--you know, it's--you don't have that someone passing this along and it's not a (unclear).
Speaker 1: And how did life change for you when you went to live with your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Well, it got a lot serious, you know; he was strict, he was a strict disciplinarian, but he put structure--you know, there was structure there, and we--you know, church and chores and school and studying and doing your homework and helping out and, you know, that whole work ethic probably--I know, not probably.  That's because basically the situation I was in with my aunt was--you know, I was moving in the direction of being spoiled, I think.  But that kind of went out the window, you know (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Story_ID: 227314

Speaker 1: And what, what was your time with them like?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it was a visit in the country, you know.  It's like they lived out in the country, and later my grandfather, I think, moved in town, but we would go out and visit them and spend a day or so, you know?  They had a farm, nice house, and--but a thing I remember is that they owned their own land; they had their own land (simultaneous).

Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What's--
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was born in '37 [1937], and I remember my mother [Elizabeth Saunders Lewis] making quilts and my daddy [Fritz Lewis, Jr.] in the quartet and, you know, this is like '38 [1938], '39 [1939]--'38 [1938], '39 [1939]; '39 [1939] there was a big huge snowstorm in Mississippi with icicles and stuff, so I remember that; I mean, I was--and I remember being on that [Shieldsburg (ph.)] plantation and my great-great-grandfather lived down the path from us; I remember him.  His name--well, he was--I'm named after him, really; Roy--Filroy [ph.].  And so I remember him, yeah.  I remember that period before we moved to Oakland [Mississippi].
Speaker 1: And did your great-grandfather ever share any stories with you about what life was like for him as a boy, and what the plantation was like at that particular time when he was growing up?
Speaker 2: He might have, you know, but I'm sure he said--I still think he planted a lot of stuff on me, but--you know, I mean--two years old, I mean I wouldn't remember any of that.  I mean I, I remember the visuals, see what I'm saying?  I can visualize these things, because--you know, I remember the house, I remember, you know, the porch, the icicles, the rehearsals that my dad was in, in a quartet, and my mother sang with the choir; her friends coming over with quilting and that kinda stuff.  But I don't remember anybody telling me any, "Well, you know, it was like this," because my great-great-grandfather could very easily have been, you know, just outta slavery--
Story_ID: 227316
Speaker 1: And what were holidays and special occasions like in your house growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, Christmas was a, you know, always a big, big thing.

I mean, it wasn't all the gifts and stuff--people sort of made gifts, and fruit was a big thing, you know?
Speaker 1: Receiving fruit?
Speaker 2: Receiving fruit, yeah--a few gifts, maybe, sometime, but that's later, you know.  But on the farm, you know, that's like you, you know, you're just looking forward to that period when you're--the baking and the pies and the cakes and stuff.

Speaker 1: And what was that community?  What was that block, or what was that street like?

We walked to church; it was maybe a mile, mile and a half.  He was the deacon of the church, he worked at a black-owned fish market in Natchez and, you know, lived right next door to a guy who was a doctor; that was when the communities were, you know, you didn't have this--you had different stratas of people living--it was a nice community. I grew up there and, you know, it was the beginning of, I guess, you know, orientation to the whole urban versus--even though I'd been in town for a year or so, or two years nearly about, living with my auntie, but that's where, you know, I kind of begin with the school and going from elementary to junior high [Brumfield School, Natchez, Mississippi], then into high school [Sadie V.

Speaker 2: I went to--I started out with a Catholic school, St. Francis [Catholic School, Natchez, Mississippi], and then I went to--called Prince Street Elementary [School, Natchez, Mississippi], and that was in--and that--but that was like a cross-town; that was like a public school, Prince Street.

Speaker 2: I always liked geography and--geography--probably was geography and--I didn't like math too much; didn't like English too much, which I wish I had've paid attention to more but, you know, I liked geography because, I think it was, I had imagination, you know, I was always like, I'd probably be traveling some of these places--imagine them.

We'd go--you know, we had bayous and all that kind of stuff; you'd go out down and swing on vines and all that kind of stuff where--it's a lot of outside stuff in a rural setting like that, because even though we lived--Pine Street [Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr. Street, Natchez, Mississippi] was like close to the country.  I mean you could, you know, walk for a little while and you'd be in the bayou, or you'd be close to a creek or something.

Story_ID: 227323
Speaker 1: And what was the name of your junior high school?

Speaker 1: Did you like home ec?
Speaker 2: Well, at first, you know, not, not really but, but it was good because, you know, we had some good teachers, you know.  We had people that--because, you know, in that situation, teachers were really--they were, in some cases, extended parents for a lot of us, you know; they really were involved and, and made sure that we kinda like--they knew some of our circumstances, and so they kind of like really was more than just teachers in a lot of cases.

We really--you know, you go out in the day time and, you know, you go out in the morning and you know, you'd just be out; be out all day, you know, and then you come back, clean up, to bed, school, study, and then you got to--I remember a big thing during that period of course was, you know, a fight; and say like some people had radios and Joe Louis fought; that was like a community event.  I mean, you know, like you could, you could hear--and that was like really the major deal, you know, when he fought.
Story_ID: 227325
Speaker 1: And during junior high school [Brumfield School, Natchez, Mississippi], did you start to have some dreams and aspirations about what you thought you'd do when you'd grow up?
Speaker 2: I really didn't.  I mean I--when I think about it, I thought about, you know, like going to Chicago [Illinois], kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Like, did you have family members in Chicago?
Speaker 2: My aunt left and went to Chicago, and I was--always the thought that that was where I was gonna go, you know, and actually I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Would she come back and tell you stories and--
Speaker 2: Well, she would come and she would send things--clothes--and she would write letters, and she was very much involved, you know, with my upkeep and, and support.  And so I--at one point I actually thought I was--she was going to come and take me to Chicago, but that didn't happen.
Story_ID: 227326

Speaker 2: Hmm, there--Clarence Robingson [ph.] who lived sort of behind me, in the alley behind me, Walter Squaws [ph.] who was in my class, Marion Washington [ph.], you know, just classmates, my classmates, and then we kinda--some of us--well, Clarence and I were closer because, like I said, we lived within proximity.  Dave Frazier [ph.], another guy who I used to work with at a grocery store and stuff, and he lived up the street; we all lived in the same area.
Speaker 1: And at this particular time in your life during the junior high school years, who was influencing you?
Speaker 2: Well, let's see; right during, at this period, in junior high, just beginning of--my grandfather [James Saunders] passed, you know, so it was basically, you know, minister, teachers, people in the neighborhood, godmother--I had a godmother that was--thank goodness, you know, I had a godmother that had--I was--she was my godmother, went to same church and--Mattie B. Frazier--and they lived right just across the street, you know, right down across the street from where I lived, so that was probably one of my strongest influence because she was--had been a teacher in Arkansas, and she would take me with--they would go on the road every once or twice a month and go visit their family up in Vicksburg [Mississippi], Port Gibson [Mississippi], Port Gibson, and so that would--she would probably be one of my strongest influence, right along with my grandfather and my aunt, and--
Story_ID: 227327
Speaker 1: And when your grandfather [James Saunders] passed, did you all continue to live with your step-grandmother [Jute (ph.) Saunders]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and it was pretty close.  It--you know, the time between them both passing, it was like a--it's kind of, like, it's foggy.  It's interesting but who went first, you know; that's--you know (laughter), it's--but it was around the same time and, and, and after they passed, it basically became me and my two sisters and couple of my brothers moved in--my older brothers moved in, and so we were just like the nucleus of the family.
Speaker 1: And they began to take on like the parental role.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, and, I mean, at this point, fifteen, fourt--fifteen, sixteen, you know, I'm basically working and taking care of myself.
Speaker 1: What kind of jobs did you have?
Speaker 2: I worked paper boy--
Speaker 1: What paper did you deliver?
Speaker 2: Oh, wow, the Natchez--it wasn't the [Natchez] Democrat then, it's the Democrat now, but it was a--some--I can't think of the name of it, it just--
Speaker 1: So, paper boy, and you mentioned earlier that you worked at a grocery store?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that--we had to work to the grocery store, a neighborhood grocery store with Dave [Frazier (ph.)]; Dave and I used to work there delivering groceries, and then the paper boy.  I did--I think one of my first was like shoeshine; I mean that's one of my earliest at a, at a barber shop, shoeshine.  And then the paper route, which kinda was--I did go a little wild because I wound up buying a bicycle and that kinda stuff, and it was--actually it was out in the suburbs; I mean, I had to take these papers all the way out to the suburbs, you know?  So I wound up getting a bicycle and later a scooter, and worked at a theater-
Speaker 1: What did you do at the theater?
Speaker 2: I just cleaned up, and then the big job for me during that period was like a busboy at Walgreens because that was like more--it was really a salary with, you know, deductions and that kind of stuff.  That's about sixteen--I guess I'm sixteen--fifteen, sixteen.

Speaker 1: And what was the name of the high school you attended?
Speaker 2: Sadie V. Thompson [High School, Natchez, Mississippi].
Speaker 1: Sadie V. Thompson?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, high school.
Speaker 1: And were you involved in any clubs or activities or sports?
Speaker 2: I used to sing in the choir; sing in the choir, and I did football; yeah, they were the first team--'55 [1955], '56 [1956]; it was like the first team, and I went out.
Speaker 1: And when were you--when did you start developing a love for photography?  Was that later in life?
Speaker 2: Well, it was later at formal, but really during that period, I--you know, they have what they call a D.O., diversified occupation in high school where you actually decide on a kind of a career, and I selected printing, so I went with a local newspaper [City Bulletin] and the editors to take pictures; he had a camera, he also introduced me to like jazz and, you know, music, and we used to produce stuff with the paper; we brought the [Harlem] Globetrotters there, so that whole, commerce, you know, being involved in a business--a black business--the man who owned the paper owned the, the Savoy Grill [Natchez, Mississippi]; it was like a cafe, and that was right there.  It was on a strip where, you know, at that time in Natchez [Mississippi], a lot of the blacks owned business on the main street, like right on Main Street, right off of--and the theater is here, and this next block is basically all black.
Speaker 1: And do you remember how you felt, like the first time you took a photograph and developed it and, you know, actually saw the photograph?  I mean, was there a spark there at that particular time, or what were some of your thoughts?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean I didn't start taking pictures then; I did photograph then on--my senior tour, we did a senior tour in '56 [1956]; we went to Talladega [Alabama], Tuskegee [Alabama], and I had a little box camera, and I took that along, and so bringing that back and showing everybody the pictures, giving some of the pictures, that was kind of like the beginning.  But also seeing this editor who was a photographer, seeing some of his work, and actually watching the creating of the paper, actually being a part that and being a part of the printing, I think that's where it really started, where I began to kind of get a sense of, you know, the newspaper, how important it was; I'd distribute them a lot, and I did some distribution.  The photography thing came much, much, much later really, I mean in terms of formal.
Story_ID: 227329
Speaker 1: And when you were in [Sadie V. Thompson] High School [Natchez, Mississippi], what were some of your dreams and aspirations?
Speaker 2: I guess I was singing during that period, so I actually was thinking about a career as a vocalist, so I mean that's kind of like the only thing that I could kind of, you know--and then after I started with the printing, I really--I went through Tuskegee [Alabama], went through Tuskegee [Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and I thought about going there to college, but I--the only way I could go would be like a five-year plan, and so--and my grade average wasn't high enough for it, but printing--as a printer, you know what I mean--go and study printing.
Speaker 1: And what were some of your thoughts about college when you were in high school?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, I really didn't think that I would be going, you know, until I really went through Tuskegee and I really kind of said, "Oh, wow, this is something I really think I want to do."  And maybe if that had happened earlier, you know--we had a Natchez [Junior] College [Natchez, Mississippi] there, we had a Alcorn [Agricultural and Mechanical] College [Alcorn State University, Lorman, Mississippi] around, but I hadn't spent time on the campuses.  We actually went and spent a time--night at Talladega [College, Talladega, Alabama], a night at Tuskegee, and so those kind of, you know--"Oh, I can--" you know.  And then the fact that they had a great printing program, and I'm doing this, you know, that's what I was doing, so I said, "Hey, this is something I might want to do."
Story_ID: 227330
Speaker 1: And what year did you graduate from [Sadie V. Thompson] High School [Natchez, Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: Fifty-six [1956].
Speaker 1: And were you influenced by any particular teachers in high school?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah; I had a lot of influences there.  Miss Whitmore [ph.] was home ec [home economics], and Miss Jone--Mr. Jones, Charlie Jones [ph.], was one who really, you know, like--is very influential at junior high [Brumfield School, Natchez, Mississippi].  Mr. Jennings [ph.] who was the principal, Mr. Johnson [ph.] who taught history, and then Mr. Northington, Hiawatha Northington, who was like a physics teacher, and was one-a those teachers that was young, came out of college, Jackson State [University, Jackson, Mississippi], and was pretty young; I mean, he was like in his early twenties--twenty-four, twenty-five, so he was close to, you know, our age; we actually did some socializing at some point, you know, because I basically was living in an adult world.  I mean, I was taking care of myself; I was--you know, there was no supervision there saying, "Go do this," or, "go do that" at that point in high school.
Speaker 1: And so toward the end of high school, what were you thinking you were gonna do with your life?
Speaker 2: Well, for that time of trying to go to college and that didn't happen, so I said, "Okay, I'll go to Chicago [Illinois]," and which I did; I went to Chicago right after high school.
Speaker 1: And so that was in 1956?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 227331
Speaker 1: And what did you do when you went to Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I looked around for a job; I moved in with my auntie, Bobbie [ph.] Lewis, and looked for a job, you know, post office, the normal--tried to get some reference from people; didn't really like the situation that I was in, I mean in terms of the living place, but once I went south--South Side of Chicago, and began to see that, I said, "Oh, okay."  Because when I arrived there, it was like at night, and I said, "Whoa, I don't know that I want to be here," (laughter).  You know, it was just the whole thing of people being packed up like that.  I said, "No, this is a little rough," you know, to come in on that at night, you know?  But, you know, as I began to see that it was a lot more expansive, and people lived in a little better conditions, and then I--one of the things my godmother had told me if I go to--well, when I go to Chicago, was to--if I go by Johnson Publishing Company, to tell Johnny [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson], her student, you know, that she said, "Hello."  And so eventually I went by there just to do the tour, see what it was like, and the young lady who showed me around, I told her the story that this was my godmother and that, you know, she had taught Mr. Johnson, and so she wound the tour up at his door and knocked on the door, and he came out, and I told him my godmother was Mattie B. Frazier and he, "Oh, yes," he remembered her and then the young lady said, "ge's looking for a job, Mr. Johnson," and that's how I got--you know, next week, I was working at Johnson.
Speaker 1: And what were you doing there?
Speaker 2: Printing machines--data--I mean addressograph machines, sending out renewal notices, Christmas notices.
Speaker 1: Because you had a printing--you had some printing experience.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but that wasn't-it was at least mechanical; I mean, I had mechanical experience, you know; I had ran presses and stuff like that, so I did have that which, you know, you can--once you get familiar with machines, you know, you can--it trans--you know, you can kind of transfer; it's like knowing how to ride a--drive a car; I imagine if you just go from one car to another, you know you--but that did help and, you know, it was work; I mean it was an environment where, you know, this was the top; I mean Johnson Publishing Company, at the time, was like the it, and just to be on salary there was--I mean it's quite something in the '50s [1950s]--it still is.
Speaker 1: And what was the culture like in the '50s [1950s]--in the mid-'50s [1950s]?
Speaker 2: Chicago?
Speaker 1: Chicago and at Johnson Publishing.
Speaker 2: Chicago or Johnson it's the same--yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, Chicago--well, you know, we leave the South, and basically, you know, like I said, I lived in an adult world.  I mean, I partied and went out to night clubs and went to dances (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you feel like you grew up too fast?
Speaker 2: Probably, yeah, probably.  I mean, I was never too much of a young kid.  I mean, after my mother [Elizabeth Saunders Lewis] died, you know, I was like, "Hey, you got to, you got to--you got to deal."
Story_ID: 227332
Speaker 1: And so--I'm sorry, so what was the culture like?
Speaker 2: In Mississippi, it was--yeah, it's interesting because, you know, I--and even back, at flashback, I mean we lived in a neighborhood, before I moved out to with my grandfather [James Saunders] where--I mean you, you had a little section, it was black, then right next door is whites, I mean up the hill is like one of the biggest antebellum homes in Natchez [Mississippi], you know, and right up the street as you, as you go up, these houses are really, you know, really--lawyers, you know, whites--I'm talking about whites now, in the same block, within the same block you could--five houses up, you could be in, you know, with a lawyer or businessman from Natchez, and we--you had these pockets like that, even though you're in a strict segregated kind of situation.
Speaker 1: So what was it like when you first arrived in Chicago [Illinois], coming from such a heavily segregated--
Speaker 2: Well, it was like, you know, Chicago is very segregated, too, you know; I mean the West Side--I come in on the West Side--[South] Kedzie [Avenue] and [West] Roosevelt Road; it was--you had the businesses there, you know, commerce and all that, but it was basically mostly, mostly black, living at--in that area.  And the whole West Side was--then you got pockets of whites in certain areas north, North Side, further west, but where I lived it was all black.  And then, you know, I got the job at Johnson [Publishing Company]; that's a commercial area, 1820 South Michigan [Avenue]; that was like commercial, so you had a mix there.  And as you go south, South Park[way; Martin Luther King Jr. Drive] and [South] Cottage Grove [Avenue], it's all black.
Speaker 1: And so, once again, what was it like in the early--the mid-'50s [1950s]--
Speaker 2: Chicago was bustling; I mean it was the place; I mean, we called it Upper Mississippi but it was the place.  I mean, you know, South Side of Chicago, 47th Street, 55th [Street]; I mean, it was like--night life.  You didn't really have to go to the Loop [Chicago, Illinois]; I mean, you could shop, you know, night life, night clubs.  I mean I started going to clubs even when I was still on the West Side, before I moved south; I was--would come out south on the weekend and go to the Sutherland Lounge [Sutherland Hotel, Chicago, Illinois] where I began--where I first started seeing Miles Davis and a lot of other jazz musicians.  A lot of jazz, a lot of music--63rd Street; you had all these clubs on 63rd that you could just go out and go from one place to another place, to another place.
Story_ID: 227333
Speaker 1: Were you making pretty good money at Johnson Publishing [Company]?
Speaker 2: I guess for the time--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --you know, a single--I mean I wasn't making a lot of money; I probably got some of those receipts somewhere (laughter)--check stubs somewhere.  But it wasn't a lot of money, but it was enough to take care of myself at that time, you know?
Speaker 1: And were you starting to become interested in like the whole world of publishing, and that whole aspect and that kind of thing, or were you just, you know, doing your job and--
Speaker 2: I was doing my job, kind of--you know, you come into Chicago [Illinois] and you're an outsider and, you know, you're trying to find your niche, and I began to like hang out with the writers and the musicians and artists and, and--because you had writers and, you know, there, and photographers and people at the paper--I mean, at the magazine, you know?  So I began to kind of hang out with them, you know, I'd go (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you feel comfortable with that crew?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah; I was-- you know--because like--I mean I'd--I made a decision not to go into the entertainment thing; I basically decided that that was, you know--I didn't--I was checking out their lifestyle, and they didn't seem to have too much control over what they were doing, and I didn't think I wanted to be doing that.
Speaker 1: So, at this point, your singing aspirations are done (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I wasn't doing it.  Yeah, I--you know, in high school [Sadie V. Thompson High School, Natchez, Mississippi], you know, senior year, I think I sang on the commencement's program and that kind of thing, but--and I did a little, maybe--because we had a little group, you know; we were a band and stuff.  But in Chicago, no, I didn't, I didn't do anything, no; I didn't follow that at all.
Speaker 1: And so when did you start becoming very interested in photography?
Speaker 2: I would say late '50s [1950s]; I began to look at these books or--I was hanging out, like I say, with photographers and had this guy Schuler, Bob Schuler [ph.] who, who we used to, we used to go to jam sessions together and he, he was a photographer, and I was always saying, "That's a good picture," you know, "that's a good picture," and he was always trying to encourage me to get a camera, because he could see that I was interested.
Speaker 1: And that you had a good eye.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And then I'm working around photographers, I'm in--spending more time in the, in the, in the art department that every minute I'm not in my department working, I'm in the art department because I worked in a department with about thirty women, the subscription department, and so I spent a lot of time up--you know, the art department, and there was this, you know, writers and editors; all that was like inter-mixed, you know what I mean?  You, you--so you--it's like--I tell [HistoryMaker] Mr. [John H.] Johnson--I told Mr. Johnson once, I said, "You know, every time I go somewhere and I speak, you know, I always tell people I went to the Johnson University, the Johnson Publishing Company University," because it's like a school.  I mean you know, you're seeing [HistoryMaker] Lerone Bennett work, you're seeing, at the time, [Robert] Bob Johnson, you're seeing all these other historic figures in the media that, that are--Marc Crawford who went to Newsweek, you know, in the '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: What do you remember about Lerone Bennett?  What was that like?
Speaker 2: Oh, he's a homeboy; I mean he's from Mississippi, and so he was one of the writers on Ebony, and he was always very serious, and then when he did 'Before the Mayflower [: A History of Black America],' which was like '50s [1950s] that came out, maybe it was early '60s [1960s], I actually took it upon myself to sell some of those.  I did sell them, because it was a great book in terms of popularizing black history, I thought, and I just took it on myself to sell them and later on had the fortune, good fortune, to actually take a photograph that was used on one of his books called, 'Confrontation: Black and White' [Lerone Bennett, Jr.].  That's on the cover of one of his books so, you know, it's like being in that situation where you are doing--you are trying to get your work published in Jet or in Ebony, and you're going out doing assignments at night, you know?  You're working at night and you go home, you process the stuff, or bring it in, take it to the lab the next morning--in their lab, and it gets used in Jet.  I mean I think my first picture was '64 [1964], Jet magazine (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was it--
Speaker 2: Thelonious Monk and Ray Ravena [ph.]--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --I think that, that's what it was, yeah--in Jet.  And then later on, Ebony assignments, you know, where you're covering a lot of the stuff that's going on in town, the jazz, the music, the protests--that kind of stuff; that's sort of like what I lean to, you know, because I was--it was my interest; it was like the time when a lot of stuff was going on in Chicago during that time.
Story_ID: 227334
Speaker 1: So when did you start thinking, okay, I'd better make a career out of photography?  Was that after the Jet photo?
Speaker 2: Well, when I actually thought about career there, I got into photography in the service, like in '61 [1961].
Speaker 1: Okay, so in 1961, you went into the service.
Speaker 2: Sixty [1960]; I went in in '60 [1960].
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty [1960]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What branch of the [U.S.] military?
Speaker 2: [U.S.] Army; I got drafted.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: They almost had to come and get me.
Speaker 1: And where were you stationed?
Speaker 2: Well, I went in at Fort Leonard Wood [Missouri], but then I went to Fort Riley [Kansas] where I did basic (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's Kansas, right?  Fort Riley?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Fort Riley, Kansas--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --and then to Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio [Texas]; that's where I spent my--most of my time, I--nearly two years.
Speaker 1: And how did you become interested in photography in the military?
Speaker 2: Well, I was walking across--like I said, the interest was there already (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How did you begin developing your, your craft?
Speaker 2: --you know, having worked at Johnson [Publishing Company], it, it's--I walked across the post one day and a guy said, "You wanna buy a camera?"  He just come back from Korea, and I bought the camera for twenty-five dollars.  Got a roll of film and shot the roll of film and did some stills and some other things, and then took it to the post; they have a base--have a post, a darkroom, where you can go and process your stuff.  They kind of run you through it, take you through the steps, and I did that and, you know, from then on I just would shoot around, shoot things on the base and things happening in San Antonio, go down on the, on the canal or, you know, to the air base and just shoot some things and continue to process as I was going, and then when I moved back to Chicago [Illinois] after I--because I got married in the service also.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: It became a little more serious, you know.  I said, "Well, this is something," because I began to see that, you know, the power of the whole photographic thing.  A friend of mine had given me a book like, just before I went to service called--what is it?  The--ooh, that's way out.  The book, the book--the--I can't think of it right now; that's funny (laughter) that I--it slipped my mind.  But Edward Steichen--it was a book about--that is way out that I cannot think of that book.  But anyway (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It'll come to you.
Speaker 2: It'll come to me.  But, but it was a book that kind a lot of photographers--Edward Steichen put this exhibit and--'The Family of Man,' and it was a very important book for the '50s [1950s] because it showed all people from all over the world, you know, from birth, you know, growing up, marriage, life, death, and all these pictures from all these different photographers, and I began to see the--really the power of photography from that book.  And like I said, hanging around artists, being in their company, seeing--being around art exhibits and being around--you know, you could begin to see the relationship.
Story_ID: 227335
Speaker 1: So after your photo was published in Jet.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But what's that like for a photographer to get your first, you know, published photo in a major magazine at the time?
Speaker 2: It makes you feel good, you know?  It's like, that's what it's about--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is it validation?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's--I--yeah, it makes you feel good, but it's like that's why you're--you know--and I was selling photos, you know, and I wasn't like--you know, I mean at that point I was like--I wasn't just doing photography as a hobby; I never did really do that.  Even in the [U.S. military] service I would sell pictures to the other soldiers.  I mean the commerce pieces--because, you know, you have to support it and that.  Later I had a family, so I had to--the photography became income, you know?  I would do jobs and, you know, I set up a darkroom in my house and, you know--so that, that became another source of income, but I did--the idea that, you know--the thing about 'The Family of Man' [Edward Steichen], and then later Roy DeCarava and Langston Hughes' '[The] Sweet Flypaper [of Life].'  That was like in the '50s [1950s] also.  These two books, and then later 'House of Bondage,' from a guy name Ernest Cole out of South Africa.  These books really, because they dealt with serious issues that related to where the photographer was and the things that he saw and what he was trying to do, so for me photography, even in the beginning, being around Ebony, watching Ebony come out every week, I mean every month, and Jet come out, Negro Digest and Tan--all these publications, they were dealing with the issues of the day, you know?  It focused you around that this is a medium that you can use to affect change or affect people, and that, that has always been with me, I mean right from the start.
Story_ID: 227336
Speaker 1: And can you kind of tell us a little bit about what it was like in the beginning, you know, trying--taking these photographs trying to--hoping to get them published and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's not easy.
Speaker 1: Well, what's it like?  What's the process like?  So, you're still at Johnson Publishing [Company].
Speaker 2: Well, you, you learn--yeah, you're still at Johnson.
Speaker 1: Are you on the photography staff at this point?
Speaker 2: No, no, I'm still working in the subscription department, and I'm freelancing, you know; I'm trying to get--bring this ad, and in some cases it'd be some of the same stuff that the editor would--photographers might have gone out, but I'm bringing my stuff in in case some of this might be, you know, the data to look at; he want to use the best.  And sometime it'll be stuff that--photographs that they didn't know went on; I'd just--or somewhere I am.  And so you're developing some of your own subject matter and, you know, so it's a--and then there are other photographers.  One of the art director, Norman L. Hunter who was a good friend of mine, he and I started around the same time, and even though he's art director of Jet, he still--we go out and we shoot together, we go on assignments sometime together; we--you know--we--our interests, and so we were good friends; we were almost like brothers, really.  And, and I had a close relationship with him even though I had a relationship with other, you know, writers and other photographers there.  It was a guy name Lacey Crawford who, who really--he was a key, and then there's this--a guy David [W.] Jackson who--I think David Jackson did a couple-a portraits of me at a Christmas party, and this was even before I went in the [U.S. military] service, I think--yeah, it was.  And, you know, he was the photographer who did the pictures of Emmett Till that were in Jet--those gruesome pictures?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And so he--you know, another photographer can tell when somebody's interested, so I think he kind of knew I was interested too, so he gave me these (unclear) prints--these prints of myself, and at the time I was like the Ivy Leaguer, you know, and supposedly hip--shades on inside the building and stuff, and he took these pictures, and it was like really--I mean, I had never really viewed myself like that.  I think that was the decisive moment in terms of--even though it was before that I got the camera but, you know, the seeds have been planted long before, and then that was just--wow, this is--I didn't realize that even--I didn't--it didn't even look like me; I didn't--you know, you don't know that's the way you look, you know, and then if you say, "Well, wow, you can do that."  And then you got these other things happening parallel to that, you know?
Speaker 1: So, eventually did you become a member of the photography staff at Johnson Publishing?
Speaker 2: Not officially, no.  I later talked my way into being in the darkroom working with Lacey for about six months, but then the people in--downstairs in the subscription department--well, really, the lady just couldn't run her department without me so I went back and actually, I knew then I was gonna be leaving out of there.  I mean, you know, eventually, a few years later, I got out of there, and I went on leave (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Is that when you became freelancer, or did you do something in-between that?
Speaker 2: I went on leave in '68 [1968]; I took a leave in '68 [1968].  At that point, I'd put together an exhibition that had been traveling around the country called 'Black and Beautiful' and you know, my name was pretty much out there because as--the thing about working at Johnson and then working with Jet magazine, sometime you get what they call A Week's Best, and your name is under it, so people kind of know who you are, so when I went out on the road with this exhibition which started right here in Washington [D.C.], in '67 [1967], then to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] and then New York [New York] and the back to Chicago [Illinois].
Story_ID: 227337
Speaker 1: So tell us a little bit about 'Black is Beautiful,' [sic.] the exhibit.  What were some of the photographs (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Black and Beautiful.' 'Black and Beautiful.'
Speaker 1: 'Black and Beautiful,' I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was the title of the exhibit that I put together.  Actually, I was asked by a guy that used to--I met in Detroit [Michigan] in '67 [1967], a poet who was from here [Washington, D.C.].  We had a--something called a New School of--not something, but a New School of Afro-American Thought [Washington, D.C.]; it was a community place where they had shows and exhibitions, and we ran into each other at a black arts conference in Detroit, and he was having a celebration like in October of that year and he asked me to--would I have an exhibit, and he was telling me that Don Lee [HistoryMaker Haki Madhubuti] would be there, and LeRoi Jones [Amiri Baraka], and so "Why don't you put together an exhibit and come out?"  And so I put together the exhibit 'Black and Beautiful.'
Speaker 1: What were some of the photographs in the exhibit?
Speaker 2: Oh, you know, John Coltrane, [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.]--
Speaker 1: How were you able to get access to those people?
Speaker 2: I was covering stuff that had happened; I mean John Coltrane, I photographed him at the [1965] DownBeat Jazz Festival [Chicago, Illinois] in 1960--in 1965, and then Martin Luther King was in Chicago [Illinois] during '66 [1966], you know, doing the end the slum [Chicago Freedom] Movement.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the, the first time you photographed Martin Luther King?
Speaker 2: It was at Johnson [Publishing Company].  He came by there like maybe '64 [1964]--'65 [1965], something like that.  He just came by to visit, and it was like all the staff kind of came out, and we had a room where we sort of had meetings and stuff, and it was almost like a little balcony; you go up a half--and him and [HistoryMaker] Mr. [John H.] Johnson was like standing there.  I can see the photo, yeah; that was my first photo of him, but then I kind of like went to places where they had meetings with him, and then later when he came to--well, there was the [James] Meredith March [Against Fear] that I took my vacation and went down to Mississippi and then he came to Chicago later on that year, '66 [1966].

Speaker 1: When you were at Johnson [Publishing Company] and you would, you know, take your photographs in the evening, on the weekend, and what-have-you, was there any resentment from some of the staff photographers, or what kind of was the feeling?
Speaker 2: No, it was like--almost like a workshop situation because--I mean Lacey [Crawford], David [W.] Jackson--I mean he, he left, you know; he--matter-of-fact he, he died, you know; he died during that period.  And then Lacey and a guy named Ted Williams who I later studied with--Ted worked in a lab, and Lacey worked in a lab and also did assignments, and then there were other photographers there that, you know, you were interested, so they would kind of critique and go over work and look at it and give you pointers, and so it was that kind of-
Speaker 1: So they didn't really feel threatened.
Speaker 2: Oh, no--no, no.  It was almost, like I said, a school; I mean you literally--you know, the guy Lacey would process a lot of my stuff so he could actually critique and really go over it and give me pointers on lighting, on this; try this, try that, and then later when I got into the darkroom to work with him, it was really something, because I learned you could learn a lot when you working not only just your work, but other people's work, you know, when you're printing it.
Story_ID: 227339
Speaker 1: And so what did you do after the 'Black and Beautiful' exhibition was completed?
Speaker 2: It toured, you know, it toured.  Like, it opened here [Washington, D.C.] in October and then went to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania]; from Pittsburgh, it went to New York [New York] to Countee Cullen's in New York, and then moved back to Chicago [Illinois] to South Side Community Arts Center [sic. South Side Community Art Center, Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: What--how was it being received?
Speaker 2: It was being received very well, I mean, because it was--I basically dealt with positive images, you know, Afro hair style, music, culture, the different--the dress, some of the dancing and--during that time, because you got to remember that middle '60s [1960s] you had a cultural explosion all over the country, and I photographed a lot of that, and that's why I wanted to, you know, deal with that being black and also beautiful, you know, because the term black, early '60s [1960s], you know, wasn't--and people didn't wanna be called that, so I just said, "Well, okay I'm going to deal with this," and titled it that.  Yeah, they had the term, black is beautiful, but I--something--I just--'Black and Beautiful,' I kind of--it rang, and I wrote a little something that sort of said--that spoke to that.
Story_ID: 227340
Speaker 1: Did you document a lot of the Civil Rights Movement?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean, that's where I basically--a lot of people know me from that, because you had a lot of protest in Chicago [Illinois]--[HistoryMaker] Dick Gregory leading marches, you had [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] coming in there, and after Medgar Edgars got killed, you had those kind of marches, NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] marches.  You had marches around specific issues, you know, the school board issues, housing issues, when Dr. King came there--end of slum [Chicago Freedom Movement], you know.  You had all these marches trying to effect change in Chicago, because there was still a lot of segregation in a lot of areas that blacks weren't living in--couldn't live in, I mean, because it was just--I mean, I was out in Gage Park [Chicago, Illinois] the day Dr. King got hit in the head with a rock; I mean it was, literally--we had actually just left Mississippi, and I felt more scared there than I did in Mississippi, and I grew up in Mississippi, even though--I mean, I don't know that it's in--both places were dangerous places to be; I mean literally felt like you--we were behind enemy lines, I mean, because people were throwing cherry bombs and, and we rode back to our community, they were throwing bricks at the buses and stuff.  It was--and there were people out there with swastika signs.  I mean I have a photograph of a little young girl, maybe eight, nine years old behind the police, leaning down on the ground with a swastika sign, you know, and I submitted that to the encyclopedia for racism.
Speaker 1: And what happened?
Speaker 2: They didn't use it but I think that's--when you--when it--there were people in that audience, I mean, in that crowd that were like--I mean we had nuns in the procession because [HistoryMaker Reverend] Jesse [L. Jackson] was one of the people in--and some of the language, I mean it was just--you know, it wasn't--it was really ugly, because can you imagine being, you know, out with hundreds of people, hundreds of people, and then they're all surrounding you and you could feel this hate.  You can feel it.  It's something that, just like you can feel love, you can feel hate and, you know, you begin to say, "Woah," because after they hit Dr. King on the head with the rock, you know, they got him out of there, you know.  It was not a good feeling.
Story_ID: 227341
Speaker 1: And shortly after that, did you start to become interested in film?
Speaker 2: Yeah, during that period, the 'Black and Beautiful' [exhibition] kind of put me out on a national piece, and then we had--Roy DeCarava would come out of Chicago [Illinois], and then there was this guy who worked on this film, and they went on.  Leroy Lucas who was a still photographer, but he was also a cameraman, and he begin to encourage you, "Oh, you guys need to get into film,"  and I was beginning to do a little Super 8 [film], and then I had an opportunity to work with the local television station doing a film on Operation Breadbasket [Rainbow PUSH Coalition, Chicago, Illinois], and so that's when I did like, you know, really--real 16 mm [film] and doc [documentary] stuff, you know, I mean, sixty--an hour film for WGN Television [WGN-TV, Chicago, Illinois].  I mean, I got hired basically not so much because I was a cameraman, but because of my stills, you know?  Just seeing the eye, you know?  The producer looked at the stills and said, "Oh, yeah, we want to use him."  And then they trained me like overnight; like I went in the hotel room, and the next morning I was at Operation Breadbasket filming.
Speaker 1: Was it a pretty easy transition for you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was in it; I was in it already.  I mean, I just didn't know the technical--
Speaker 1: I mean, to go from still to--
Speaker 2: It is, if you--I mean, the way I shoot, I mean, I was already shooting film, in a sense that--it just wasn't moving; I mean, I never would--I'm never satisfied with like one frame, one shot, you know?  I'm gonna shoot at all different angles, you know, and different perspective because that's kind of the way I view it.  And so it's sort of like, that's the way film is, you know?  Film is motion, and so, he could see that; he could see that.  It's just (unclear) and having the eye.  I mean, you know, the guy gave me an (unclear) camera and said, "Okay, now, go out and illustrate this poem," you know, so I--hmm.
Speaker 1: And what did you shoot?
Speaker 2: I went out, shot some things in the park, shot some--you know, driving down the street seeing a sister in a nice big afro--not afro, but African wrap, dress, and some boys in front of a, you know, a church, you know, sort of--just whatever I saw.  I was trying to--it was--I don't remember the poem, and I don't have a copy of that film, I just know WGN's got it somewhere if they ain't throw it away; it's somewhere.  I would, one day, would like to get a shot of that, but it was on Operation Breadbasket.  It was done about 1968, something like that.
Story_ID: 227342
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about 1970, your interview with Elijah Muhammad.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was--we--I, at that point, moved on into doing stuff with 'Black Journal,' and I did a job with--the year or so before that, I had did a job, freelance job, with--and a year-end wrap-up where they were going around talking to black leaders about what they felt about that year, '68 [1968], '69 [1969], and we did an interview with Mr. Muhammad--me and St. Clair Bourne, and St. Clair was the producer out of New York [New York]; they would bring the crew with them, and then I was the camera person, because I lived in Chicago [Illinois] and so--well, actually at the time we did that, I was down in University of Notre Dame [South Bend, Indiana]; I had moved to University of Notre Dame.  I left Chicago in '69 [1969] and moved to University of Notre Dame, where I worked for two years training, doing--training cinematography, training paraprofessionals and people who had dropped out of school, didn't have their high school diploma, training them to do 16 mm film work, to do commercials for television, to recruit adult basic ed [education] students.  And so, I took a week leave or a week break, and went up to Chicago and worked on that 'Black Journal' piece on the nation of common sense ['A Nation of Common Sense'], and St. Clair came out.  But anyway, getting back to how that got started, he--we got through the interview and Mr. Muhammad said that, "You know, usually there's no black crews coming up in here," and he said--and St. Clair--he said, "well, we'd like to do a feature piece," and he said, "wait, we'll get it together."  And a year later, we were doing it, and we did a week.  We covered the bakery, the grocery store, the farm, the newspaper, and then we did the school.  I guess we did about--it wound up being about eight minutes in the film; it was a twenty minute film.
Speaker 1: And what was that like for you to work so closely with--
Speaker 2: Well, I mean I had been to the mosque; I mean, I had, you know, gone to the mosque on my own even in the '50s [1950s].  I mean, I'd gone over there because--my first intro [introduction] to Mr. Muhammad was like Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier] column in Natchez [Mississippi], and a man used to sell this paper, and I remember him in that, you know?  And then when I moved to Chicago, all the--you know, the Muhammad Speaks [Muslim Journal] newspapers and that whole thing; I was like--I mean, I covered a lot of--the thing about that period was that, you know, you move from different things every other day or so, and so you were--I mean, I knew Muslim friends, I had Muslim friends, so it was not like--
Story_ID: 227343
Speaker 1: So, at this particular time in 1970, were you able to pretty much make a living with--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I was freelance; I mean, I--well, I was working at University of Notre Dame [South Bend, Indiana]; I was on salary in this project; it was called Project Reach; that was the project that one of the professors put together and, you know, he--McCullin, Sam McCullin [sic. Samuel D. McClelland], he put this--they got a RFP [Request for Proposal] from HEW [U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare] and--to develop this program to do commercials for television to recruit adult basic ed [education] students in that area, and so he called New York and he--both places he called recommended me, and so I was working at a college called Northeastern [Illinois University] in Chicago [Illinois] at the time, and so--
Speaker 1: What were you doing at Northeastern?
Speaker 2: I was doing film; I mean I was like filming activities--student activities programs, that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: And what year was that?
Speaker 2: I went--I started working for them in '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: So you did that while you toured with 'Black is Beautiful' [sic.].
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was doing, 'Black and Beautiful' exhibits and freelance jobs, then I did the summer program with training students in photography under Humphreys [ph.]--some sort of program with popular photography after I left Johnson [Publishing Company], you know, in sixty--I left in '68 [1968], so between '68 [1968] and the time I started work, '69 [1969], working at Northeastern.
Speaker 1: And--so you were making a pretty good living and were developing, and had developed, a very good reputation in terms of the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I--you know, my name was out there and, you know, getting--at that point, I'm like selling pictures to Encyclopedia Britannica, and the exhibits, selling a print every now and then, going on television with--when I would--did the program with the young people, training; I was on television when I took that exhibit up to Minnesota; for a month, television and, you know, and then once I moved into doing the film, learning that myself and you--that adds a whole another cadre of people, you know--camera people, producers, you know; it's an expansive, you know, just sort of--the circle gets larger; instead of dealing locally, you're doing national and international.
Speaker 1: Which did you like best?  Did you like one better than the other?
Speaker 2: I like stills; I do like stills, but film is like sound and picture, and so, I mean, you know, when you can do it both and I did it the same way I did the stills, you know; I mean, I was moving, except when you got to work on the tripod, you know, but I was pretty fortunate because a lot of times you don't make that switch from stills to camera--first camera like that; usually, you have to go assistant, and then you (laughter), you know, you know, but I made that switch real fast, and I jumped from doing that to I'm working on films with Bill Greaves [HistoryMaker William Greaves], 'Fight of the Champions' in Madison Square Garden [New York, New York], you know?  I went to Zaire [Democratic Republic of the Congo]--
Story_ID: 227344
Speaker 1: --Then you came to Washington, D.C. in 1973?
Speaker 2: Seventy-three [1973], right.
Speaker 1: And you were freelancing here in Washington, D.C.?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: And so let's talk a little bit about 1974, the [Muhammad] Ali-[George] Foreman fight [The Rumble in the Jungle].
Speaker 2: Yeah, I moved here to deal with school and try to get certification, you know?  I figured at some point in time I might need to do that, so--
Speaker 1: So did you move your family here from Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: The family split up in South Bend [Indiana]--
Speaker 1: Um-hm, okay.
Speaker 2: --and you know, there's a lot of stuff going back and forth--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --but I moved here; they were like in the islands and I moved here and established a base here, then they eventually came to live with me here.
Speaker 1: And how was it that you ended up going to Zaire [Democratic Republic of the Congo] to shoot the Ali-Foreman (simultaneous) fight?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, that same cadre of camera people that I was working with the ['Black] Journal' people, '72 [1972], even before I moved here, we did a big film.  I did--I worked on 'Wattstax;' I went out to California.  I had a particular style of shooting, and so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How would you characterize your style?
Speaker 2: Candid; it was candid; I mean, I could--I mean, like I would want to do this interview with holding the camera right here, looking at you rather than a tripod;, I mean it would just be a different perspective; just from down here, raising it from here to down here, gives you a whole 'nother perspective, you know what I mean?  I mean, that's the standard shot he's got.  But when you put the camera down here, you know, it gives you a whole 'nother kind of piece, and I'd've wanted film from over there, and a little bit from over there, and maybe cut-aways; you're doing a--when you're doing a doc--you see, now remember, documentaries, you see; I never did--I do more news now with stills.  I used to do nothing but magazine stuff, and then I did nothing but documentaries for television, so I never did do news.  News is that shot, you know?  It's the head shot.  But documentaries, you got to have more than that; you've got to be interpretive, you've got to have something that is going to say something about what the subject matter you're dealing with.
Speaker 1: Did you find you were able to express yourself a little bit more through film?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean it's still not a--when you're doing essays now; when you're doing essays or, you know, when you're doing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Like a photo essay?  A still photo essay.
Speaker 2: --you're working--yeah, you're working on an essay, you know, or you're doing ten shots, or five or six shots, you might shoot ten rolls of film or whatever, then that's the same, or it's similar; it's very similar.  But when you look at the documentary or you look at a feature piece, you know, which 'Save the Children' was a piece we did in sev--we did 'Wattstax,' okay?  Then 'Wattstax'--the same--I left (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What is 'Wattstax'?
Speaker 2: It was a musical piece out in [Watts, Los Angeles] California with--that, that, that--or was it Stax [Records], out of Memphis [Tennessee] or--naw, Memphis?  Stax--St. Louis [Missouri]?  Memphis--I think it's St. Louis [sic.].  Stax was a big--like Morehouse [sic.], or like Motown was in Detroit [Michigan]; Stax was--you had Mables [Mable John] and you had 'Sittin' by the Dock of the Bay' [sic. '(Sittin' On) The Dock Of The Bay,' Otis Redding] you know, these kinds of--[HistoryMaker] Isaac Hayes.  Matter of fact, Isaac Hayes was like a big feature, and a lot of your artists out of Stax were featured in this Wattstax; it was a big thing at the Rose Bowl [sic. Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, Los Angeles, California].  And they brought me out because a lot of the guys, they were shooting and getting all these, you know, "Anybody want to be on camera?" You know?  So you're getting all this static stuff, so they brought me in because they knew I was a candid shooter, and I came out and worked on it, and then left there and moved back--come back to Chicago and worked on 'Save the Children,' which was a feature piece that--about Operation Breadbasket [sic. Operation PUSH; Rainbow PUSH Coalition, Chicago, Illinois]--that was done with [HistoryMaker] Stan Lathan who is now with Def Jam and all that.  Stan was the director and, you know, had about eight or nine black camera--cameramen.
Speaker 1: And what was 'Save the Children?'
Speaker 2: It is a film called, 'Save the Children,' and Michael Jackson--it was just a musical, but also, like one of my gigs was to go out and illustrate what's going on; it's--I mean, to actually put (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) From a child's perspective in the community?
Speaker 2: No, no; images.  No, these were, these were like--just some--it's the concerts that went on every day for a week, for like about five or six days.  Every night, there was these different shows, then you had the vending, you had the marketplace; Operation Breadbasket.  This was like a piece that went on every year; it was a big festival kind of piece with vendors and then shows and music, every night.  And so we filmed every three, three days or so--three, four days, and then they took all that back to New York and they cut it into a film; Michael Jackson was there, they built a disco within the building for Mike, for dancing scenes and for dancing, and Jackson Five was there, Marvin Gaye, Harry Bela--I mean not [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte but Sammy Davis, Jr.  It was a whole array.  And that got produced and it was called, 'Save the Children;' I mean that was the message, it's 'Save the Children.'  I saw it once here in Washington [D.C.] at Lincoln Theatre [Washington, D.C.], and I'm really trying to get a copy of it now from Stan, Stan Lathan.
Story_ID: 227345
Speaker 1: So let's talk about the [Muhammad] Ali-[George] Foreman fight [The Rumble in the Jungle].
Speaker 2: Hmm, '74 [1974], yeah.  That was--heard about it.  Well, some of the same people who worked on 'Save the Children,' you know.  It was almost like a format--the format that they used, they wanted--and then Hugh Masekela got involved and Hugh knew a lot of people, and then there was gonna be--you know, it was gonna be a big--it was a big deal.  And so we kind of heard that they didn't have enough black cameramen on the scene so we sort of heard that it had been picked up.  Because you know, it was an international piece; you had the British--all those people--a lot of people involved, so we went to New York and we lobbied hard on--with the production company, Zaire 74; that was the production company [sic. Zaire 74, music festival].  And, you know, we got in, and we went on over to be there [Zaire; Democratic Republic of the Congo] for, I think, two weeks, but it wound--I wound up staying like six weeks because, you know, Foreman cut his eye.  They--we did the music--it was a big music festival.  First part--it was like the first week was music festival, then it was gonna be the fight.  And so we did this bit mu--every night, every afternoon, three o'clock we went in that [20th of May] Stadium [Stade Tata Raphael, Kinshasa, Zaire] and we didn't come out 'til two or three o'clock in the morning, because these things went long and, you know, in the evening.  At night, they only had--it don't look--the festival's only at night and--but in the day time we filmed Kinshasa [Zaire] and out in the--you know, we did film all over.  We shot five hundred thousand feet of film on that shoot, you know?  And then--but what happened when Foreman cut his eye, they went ahead, did the festival and then the film crew came on back to New York and I stayed.  I asked one of the guys--I mean I--he said I could stay, so I stayed.  We had a room in the hotel and a room in the presidential guest house, you know?  I was living real well, and I had them send me my money--the rest of my money over there.  I set up a bank account and stayed there and, you know, got a chance to go out to N'Sele [Zaire] where Ali was training, and Foreman was training; got a chance to go into (unclear) over--way in the center part of Africa where Gomer [ph.] is, where the, you know, where--the game reserve with Ali's family.  Got a chance to really be in Zaire at the time.
Speaker 1: And were you taking photographs during all this?  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, yeah, I--every shoot I've ever been on, I always shoot stills--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --because, you know, I mean I shoot production stills like the crew, then I shoot what's going on, but after that, when the crew left, I just picked up my still camera and--which I had been sort of shooting all along, but then I really got into shooting color and black and white with the idea of really coming back and doing some stories and maybe a booklet.  I still think that that's a book--that there is a book in that, because of  what--just that whole deal that went on there; I mean, it was spectacular.
Speaker 1: And some of your film was used in--was it Spike Lee's [sic. Leon Gast] 'When We Were Kings'?
Speaker 2: That wasn't Spike Lee.  That was--Spike Lee didn't do that.  Yeah, I mean that was the produ--one of the pro--the original producers who finally got Ali to--you know, they finally got that together, yeah.  Some of that film is some of the film that I photogr--film that I photographed while the music festival was going on, is in that film right--I got a screen credit, yeah.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was some of the shot just below the mic [microphone] of Miriam Makeba and James Brown, yeah.
Speaker 1: So what did you do after the Ali-Foreman fight?
Speaker 2: Came back here [Washington, D.C.]; I mean I was still based here--
Speaker 1: And still freelancing.
Speaker 2: --freelancing, stills mostly, and that was kind of like the last big film piece that I worked on.  I did a little, little here, a little there (laughter), then one of the last ones I did was really a caesarean [section] in an operating room, which was really something, to film a caesarean.
Speaker 1: What was it for?
Speaker 2: It was for a doctor who worked at the school--at that hospital, who's now closed, D.C. General [District of Columbia General Hospital, Washington, D.C.], and she went to UDC [University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.] and they wanted a birth included in a commercial, so we went out and--we were waiting for just a regular birth, but then no babies were being born, and this lady had been waiting, waiting, waiting, so they did--we did the cesarean.  I mean I didn't faint, you know (laughter), I filmed it, and I even got stills of that, too.  Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 227346
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about 'The Weight,' your photograph?
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: Titled--your photograph entitled 'The Weight?'
Speaker 2: 'The Weight?'
Speaker 1: 'The Weight,' W-E-I-G-H-T?  Isn't that you?
Speaker 2: Oh, weight--on a--what, what--weight--
Speaker 1: According (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I have a photograph called 'Weight on African Man' [sic. photoessay, 'The Weight on an African Man: Sometimes Called Afro-American, Black, Negro, Colored, etc.'] or something like that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --it's in Callaloo [A Journal of African Diaspora Arts and Letters].
Speaker 1: It's from a photo I say that was taken Martin Luther King Day, 1981?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I'm sorry; I think I just shortened the title.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  'The Weight on an African-American Man.'  Let's talk a little bit (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sometimes called Black, called Negro (laughter), so forth.
Speaker 1: I really shortened the title, didn't I?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you really did, yeah (laughter).  Yeah, the idea was that, you know, the weight on the black man--colored--I used to call it I said, "Colored, Negro, black, and so forth," you know.
Speaker 1: Can you kind of describe that photograph for us?
Speaker 2: You've never seen it.
Speaker 1: I have, but I--but because people who are listening to this won't be able to see it.  Can you describe it?  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, right, right.  Yeah, it was like sub-degree weather out there; I mean, it was truly cold, I mean it was in its 15, 16, 10 degree; it was cold, and you had fifty, sixty, seventy thousand people out for--to get [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.]--every Martin Luther King birthday, there was a march or a protest trying to get this day claimed, and so this day we were out--I was out there photographing it, and this guy was coming down Pennsylvania Avenue [Washington, D.C.] going toward the [U.S.] Capitol [Washington, D.C.] with a cross.  I mean, it was no small cross; it was like a huge cross, you know what I mean, that he was dragging, so it was long enough for him to be dragging it.  He had it on his shoulder, and he was dragging that cross.  And so I photographed him coming and then going by, and then he went up to 3rd Street where he actually made a turn, and you could see the Capitol and the man carrying the cross, and it was like a sign on the--a stop sign that said, "Left Turn," "Left Turn Only," [sic. "Left Lane Must Turn Left"] or something like that, which was kind of interesting--left turn only.  So I just--I did this essay--they did this Callaloo dedicated to Sterling Brown; he is one of those people that I have photographed and, I mean, you know, there are people that I have been--that I photographed twenty-five, thirty years--just those people, I mean over a period of time--Gwendolyn Brooks, Sterling Brown, James--LeRoi Jones or [Amiri] Baraka.  I mean, I just assign myself to these people, and I just--every time I see them, I photographed them, but they did this piece dedicated to Sterling in Callaloo, and so I did this essay, photographic essay, that I put together for that, along--also in that book is also, is photographs of Sterling that I did over a period of time.
Speaker 1: And what's the name of the book?
Speaker 2: That was Callaloo.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was called Callaloo, and it was--it's still--it's a journal; it comes out of Texas now.  Charles Rowell is the editor, but it started back in the '70s [1970s], maybe middle '70s [1970s] in New Orleans [sic. Baton Rouge, Louisiana] with the first editor was a guy name Tom Dent, the young man that--the 'River Road' book; we started that project in '75 [1975] together so actually, that was around, you know--
Speaker 1: And you started the 'River Road' in 1975?
Speaker 2: He and I--Tom Dent and I, right.  It was originally gonna be just a book about small towns, but we got on the river, and we went down the river and up the river, and we decided to keep it about the river, you know; just about the communities along the Mississippi River between Natchez [Mississippi] and tip of the river, including New Orleans [Louisiana], Baton Rouge [Louisiana], and the chemical plants and oil refineries that are polluting the air, and they call it Cancer Corridor; that whole area is called Cancer Corridor, so many people died from cancer.
Speaker 1: And is it just photos?
Speaker 2: It's photos with text.  We interviewed and talked to a lot of people.  A lot of books that get done in that area, on environmental [issues], it's usually technicians and scientists doing the books, but we decided we would do this, and let the people speak, you know, talk to the people about them living in this situation.  These are--plantations are--well, the oil refineries and chemical plants are sitting on land that used to be plantations.  We call them the new plantations, and so, you know, that's--and also the antebellum homes or the tourist homes that are now, used to be the main houses; they are now tourist attractions and--but you have these little communities, and these little lanes that go off of River Road [U.S. Route 61] into--back down into these communities, and so we just go down in those communities and talk to the people that are there, and you know, I'm hoping that I have someone now that's going to really help me complete this.
Story_ID: 227347
Speaker 1: The project we were just talking about, 'River Road,' do you have--and I know it's still a work in progress, but thus far, is there a particular person who you--stands out the most to you, or that you remember a little bit more than others, of the folks that you've profiled?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Mr. White [ph.], Mr. White in that pack--you'll see a photo of him in there--Mr. White, because he was about ninety-six, ninety-seven when we photographed him, and he had lived on this land a long time, and I have a photograph of him; it's a close-up of his face that I call--well, I used to call it 'I Built This Country,' but I think I've changed it to, 'We Built this Country,' because it's sort of like a black man who was worked, and he's got the cataract eyes; you see all the creases in his skin.  And then there's Martha Young [ph.] who was 106, who was referred to us by the same person, a young lady who really gave us a lot of help because, you know, out in those rural settings, you've got to have somebody that will refer you, you know, and she referred us to these two, and has been a person who has helped us a lot, and--that, and then there are other people who, you know, you photograph that--a Mr.--I can't think of his name right now, but this young man that, that was a man who went away to the war and come back and was working in one of the plants now, and then someone down in a place call Harlem [Louisiana]; it was the Harlem area, you know; that was when we first started.  So it's not so much about one or two or three people, but it's really about communities that, you know, are still in existence that used to be, all intent purposes, slave communities, you know?  This is these places where--areas where people--black people lived, you know, doing time they were like enslaved.
Speaker 1: And now enslaved in just a different way.
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But then--
Speaker 2: --in a certain kind of way; I mean, they--you know, some of them have built new homes, and they have--still have some of the shotguns there.  You have a mix of, you know, it's not just one strata, because some of these people work in Baton Rouge [Louisiana] and work in New Orleans [Louisiana] or have businesses; some of them have big houses, you know.  It's not just one--that was one of the things we wanted to show was that it wasn't, it wasn't one-dimensional; I mean, it was--when you say "rural," it's not a one-dimensional piece. I mean, we--I have a photograph of a guy in this van, multi-colored van, and they said he was selling drugs out there.  I mean, you know, it was like, you know, plush and, you know, you look at it, you think it's just colorful, but someone said he was selling drugs, so they have some of the same issues that's going on in the urban community.  But we decided we would stay with this road because it just runs right along the side of the [Mississippi] River on both sides.  It's interrupted in some places.  In--[U.S. Route] 61--when it gets to Baton Rouge, it becomes 61 and goes on up to into Memphis [Tennessee], and since recently I decided maybe we're gonna just take it on to Chicago [Illinois] instead of--not a lot, but keep mostly rural but--because so many people migrated up that road as I did.  I mean, I actually--me and a guy drove up that road on the way to--drove to Chicago, and--in '56 [1956], so a lot of other people did; but we want to keep the bulk of it rural and about the circumstance of the chemical plants and oil refiners [refineries] and the effects, and--it's sort of like writing a sentence to it in the center of my work in terms of the cause; I mean with photography, I mean that early '50s [1950s] stuff that I was observing and looking at, photography was always sort of centered around causes, you know; some of the early photographers--Weiss [ph.], who did the children's stuff, and then you got Edward Steichen, and all these people; photography was always a way to deal with issues and changes.
Story_ID: 227348
Speaker 1: Did you ever consider like photography as just a way to preserve memories, people's memories, and ever get into just like portrait photography?  Was that ever a consideration?
Speaker 2: Well, actually I do portraits, but on location.  Like, if I was shooting this, I could get a portrait of you sitting in that chair right there interviewing me, see?  Because, I mean--then you could also do the studio piece but--and I really--I had never considered myself a portrait photographer but I had this exhibit over in Georgetown [Washington, D.C.] and a guy name Michael Winston [ph.] who--you know, I had these portraitures of people--some River Road people, Elijah Muhammad and, and Michael went through it and he said, "Well, you know, you're a pretty good portrait photographer," because there's always the moment, the serious or the casual or the laugh, or whatever, that is--once you--the idea of a portrait is to tell you something about the person, and the better the portrait, the more it tells; you get some sense of that person and who that person is.  If you really get it, I mean you say, "Wow!"  You feel like you know the person, because that much information is there.  But I--my primary stuff is documentary photography, you know, so that I'm documenting events, documenting circumstances.  But within that, I'm always--Ted Williams told us, said, "You know, no matter what assignment you're on, no matter what situation you're in, always look for these categories that you're working under," you know--family, father and son--I do a lot of stuff with father and son--a family; just the--to refute some of the things--the stereotypes that are out there on black men or a black family--that we don't care, that we don't--you know, these things are out here in the general public, and that's when I say--when you say photography as a--I mean as social change, as change, political change, psychological change for--I mean, I think one of the big things in the '60s [1960s] was that our self-image, you know, of who we were--'Black and Beautiful' [exhibit]; so you go in there, you look a hundred pictures that are all positive, I mean that mostly positive images of--it reinforces, you know.  And I--what I did early is, in the first exhibit I had, I always put up a comment sheet for people to write their comments.  And I could tell from what they were saying that I was on the right track.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And I mean when I went to New York, I mean the kind of things that they wrote, I mean it was just--it's still--if I could read some of those now, it was just like--
Story_ID: 227349
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about the 'Songs of My People[: African Americans, A Self-Portrait,' Easter, Brooks & Cheers].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: The coffee table--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --book.  And you have a photograph in there.  How did that come about?
Speaker 2: I was one of the--you know, they selected about fifty photographers based on their reputation, their work and, you know, their style; it was a very competitive kind of piece, and so you had a week.  You got a hundred rolls of film, and you had a week and, of course, I went over; I--because I included [Nelson] Mandela's trip here with me and, and they didn't use it and stuff, but I still included that because that happened around the same time.  But this--I was assigned; they wanted me to shoot this wedding that I didn't really want to do that, the one they had me assigned, because it was a, you know, kind of an interracial wedding, and I won't go into who that was but--and I didn't think that was, for me, a black book doing an interracial wedding, and I didn't really like it, and what happened is the couple's mother--the mother of the bride, who was black and knew me and, and asked me, "Well, why, why does, why does what's-his-name want this in the book?  I mean why?"  And so, I said, "Hey, man, she don't want to do it."  And she didn't really want to do it for the book.  I still actually shot it, but I didn't shoot it for the book, you know?  I mean--so I got another wedding; the shot that you will see is two lawyers; one West Indian--lady's West Indian, the guy's from here; I shot it in their backyard, and it's a beautiful piece; I mean, it's like really--it really--it was the only wedding thing in the whole book, and the only downer was that it wound up not being in the exhibition, which was kind of sad because that traveled around the world, and some--when I told some people, they said, "I don't believe this."  I said, "It's not in there," and I really made an effort to get it in, but it never got in.  It's just one of those things.
Speaker 1: What did you think of the book in general?  Did you think (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think it could've been better.
Speaker 1: Do you think it's a good representation of African Americans?
Speaker 2: It's a good start--of us, yeah, and Africa American photographers, yeah.  I think it was a good book; it was a big charge, you know, to take one week and then try to interpret in 'Songs of My People.'  See, when you say--you title something 'Songs,' and I kind of like, "Okay, well 'Song,' how do you illustrate that?"  So I got into like--I read--I was doing [HistoryMaker] Richard Hunt and a young lady he was seeing at the time, and they having a sculpture conference in [Washington] D.C., and I was photographing these sculptures from all over; I mean these are major, the major black sculptures [sic. sculptors]--Richard Hunt, John Scott, Mel Edwards; these are three of the major, and so, I was photographing them, and then Richard had an opening that night and I went, and this young lady was there and I said to him at the time, I said, "Well, you all have the--I want to photograph you all because you have the right kind of love."  And once I got that handle, 'Right Kind of Love,' I knew what I wanted to do with my piece, and so I just--you know, with me--I guess with anybody, once you have a theme or a sub-theme, you title the 'Songs of My People;' that's a broad-'Songs,' but, but when I say, the 'Right Kind of Love'--I mean I got a shot of a--of two blind people.  A blind man used to sit on the corner of 9th [Street] and F [Street] at that--it was a bank then, it was a Riggs Bank [Washington, D.C.]; he would stand there with a box.  And one day I was walking by there, during that week, and another blind lady was standing there, talking to him--two blind people standing on the same corner, talking, you know what I mean?  So I just--that was the right kind of love, you know?  And so I--once you get that focus, then you can kind of, you know, really--steal back to that interpretation piece, see.
Story_ID: 227350
Speaker 1: Let's talk about the Million Man March.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, '95 [1995] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How did you capture that moment?
Speaker 2: Well, I had--I sort of psyched myself up; I mean, it was kind of rough because my dad [Fritz Lewis, Jr.] died a week--couple of weeks before that, and I had to go south to bury him, but I mean it's one of those things that--I mean, all that year, leading up to that--because a lot of my pictures in that, in the 'Million Man March' [Michael H. Cottman] book and then in the book that Third World Press put out ['Million Man March/Day of Absence: A Commemorative Anthology,' Maulana Karenga and Haki R. Madhabuti]--I think I had six in the one that Random House [sic. Three Rivers Press division, Random House] put out, and about twelve or thirteen in the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What's the name of the Random House book?
Speaker 2: 'Million Man March.'
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: And then you had the Million Man March documentary; I think it's called--something--Third World Press.  And so I went out--I mean I had been photographing the meetings, the rallies at Union Temple [Baptist church, Washington, D.C.] with [HistoryMaker] Minister [Louis] Farrakhan coming in town at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] and different places; I had on it.  Once I assign myself to something, you know, then I just sort of stay on it, and that day, I mean I--after spending most of the day trying to get press credentials and late into the night the day before, I mean you know, and being down there where they was putting together and all of that, after I got my press credentials, I went home and maybe laid down for a couple of hours or an hour, and got up, and at four o'clock, 4:30, I was down there before the sun come up and, you know, I just spent the whole day down there, dealing with security and all that other stuff that you had to deal with.  And I once--finally, after I, you know, got locked in to position, I just stayed with that position, but I was also shooting all around.  I mean there's--brother out there and "One Million Men, One Voice," you know, on a placard with red, black and green around it, and a lot of photographers shot it but they shot it from the ground level; I was up on the platform.  I shot it so you can see the men's faces around it, and then when they did the dollar thing with the money in the hands, and always the backdrop of the [U.S.] Capitol [Washington, D.C.]; always the--down the [Washington] Monument [Washington, D.C.].  I was looking at a photograph in the--actually, in the Third World Press book, the cover, and I'd never really seen it.  I was showing it to someone, and they said--right at a point beyond the reflection pool [Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool, Washington, D.C.], you could see the Monument, and it looks like a pyramid.  I mean, you can literally see the way the, you know, it--just that section that looks like a pyramid.  I said, I never even seen that, you know, within the photo.  So--but it was a day that you might hope and pray that it happened, but--and for to be in it, you know, I mean--and then, you know, I got up into the Capitol to photograph the march shot from the balcony of the Capitol; I went up in there and got it.  Came on back down and then locked down in position for the speakers and Minister Farrakhan and--basically, when he was reading the charge about, you know, the Pledge [of Allegiance], I was like going down the [National] Mall [Washington, D.C.] photographing on the way down the Mall to get the stuff to the lab so that I could get it out the next day.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite from the Million Man March?
Speaker 2: Wow, favorite.  Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: What is it?
Speaker 2: It's in the book, the one from Random House.  It's a guy look like Jesus underneath the--yeah, that's--yeah, I call it the--yeah, yeah; it's 'The Face of the Million Man March'--I think I called it that.  There was one guy died out there; I mean, he was standing in the crowd, an older man, and they brought his body across the crowd and brought him down up to where the press was, and then they--I guess they took him on out of there.  About an hour or so later, I turned around and this guy was standing there with these braids coming down like that with this Japanese black jacket on, you know, kind of like loose fitting, and I told--I looked at that dude, I said, "Wow!"  I mean it was like seeing Jesus standing there, you know?  I said--so I didn't want to flash it to the other photographers because all--photographers was all around, I mean, you know, like Moneta Sleet [Jr.]'s right over there, and other people, you know; it's like--so I just basically did a--you know, photographers have tricks of the trade.  I pre-focused, or I, you know, sort of focused--I wheeled and shot three frames, and then immediately turned back so that you know, I--you know, it was--and that was the last entry, because I almost didn't release it for the book.  I mean, it was spooky when I saw it; when I got it back, it was kind of spooky.  I said, "Whoa."  But I thought about it and I called [HistoryMaker] Marie Brown who was kind of coordinating and putting it--help put things together.  I said, "Marie, I got this picture down here," you know?  I said, "It really--I want to send it to you and see what you think."  She said, "Oh, yeah, [HistoryMaker] Roy [Lewis], I got it."  So he got in.  And these were like--most of my pictures ran full page, you know, like the one with the "Million Man, Million Voices" ran full page--that one, and then it might have been another one, and some of them were like quarter pages and stuff.  I got the first picture that--oh!  First picture in the book, full page with [HistoryMaker] Lerone Bennett, yeah, um-hm, Lerone Bennett (laughter).  You know what I mean, it seems they tie in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Full circle, full circle--
Speaker 2: --they tie in, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 227351
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite photograph period?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What is it?
Speaker 2: It's--it used to be called 'Father and Son,' and now it's 'Mothering a Child.'  You know, you change things.  It's a young man sitting in Chicago [Illinois], about '65 [1965], on 31st Street, sitting in a doorway with his little baby on his lap, and the baby is in diapers, and he's holding the baby on his lap, and the diaper bag is in front of him.  And I started out calling it 'Father and Son,' then I changed it to 'Mothering' because he--some people look at it think it's a woman, you know, he's got an afro and stuff; it's close-crop but, you know--yeah, looking at it, he's kind of looking that-aways; not looking straight into the camera, but if all the pictures were gonna be destroyed, that would be the one I would want because--
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: --it just is a total, total--it's--I guess it's the humanity of a black man, that's what it is.
Speaker 1: That isn't often portrayed--
Speaker 2: No, no.  I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--or captured.
Speaker 2: Or--well, it's captured sometime, but it's just not--it, it seems like--almost like that's the one thing they don't want to--you to have or to be, I mean--unfortunately, and it's at the crux, I think, of so much in this world today.  If they can give a black person, or people of color, humanity--then you can't do what you do, to people who are human beings.  I think that's right it, and I never quite said it like that, but I think that's--and that's at the core of what, you know, a lot of things that are done to people disturb me.
Story_ID: 227352
Speaker 1: And when you look back at your life, what stands out the most to you, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Roy] Lewis, and why?
Speaker 2: My family, my two boys and--well, actually three boys and a girl; what I've learned from them; being totally responsible for them, and then, you know, God and the community--black people, you know?  I mean, being responsible to this community that nurtured me and kind of held me in its hand when I was needing somebody to do that when I was coming up.  And so I think that--I was doing a lecture out in California once, and I told this guy, I said, "Well, you know, I'm gonna change world."  He said, "Change the world?"  I say, "Well, yeah, sure; I'm gonna change myself."  And then we have the right images; you can change a person's perceptions of something.
Speaker 1: How do you think you've changed people's perceptions with your images?
Speaker 2: By giving them the positive--that power, that strength like the young lady out in Georgetown [Washington, D.C.] when she saw these pictures of River Road.  She said, "Those people have such dignity."  I said, "Right, because they're human beings."  I mean, there's power in that, you know?  You look at Mr. White's [ph.] face and Miss Young's [ph.] hands like that--or her face; I mean this woman's 106, and she was regal, you know?  The wrinkles and stuff; she was--it's powerful stuff.  And then to--see, a lot of times, people look, and they don't look; they just--(sound)!  Look--and they don't--it don't register, you know, and I mean--I, and I don't do-don't just shoot people; I shoot flowers.  I love landscapes and, you know, scenery and stuff.
Speaker 1: But is shooting people your favorite?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's the favorite piece, yeah.  Yeah, it's the favorite, yeah.
Story_ID: 227353
Speaker 1: What advice do you have for people who may be interested in a career in photography?
Speaker 2: Get a camera, start taking pictures, and don't be boxed in, you know, with what is the normal, you know.  Find your own view, your own feeling, your own perspective, your own niche, your own vibe, and go with that, and then don't be closed to being--you know, influenced.  I'm influenced, you know--Ted Williams, Roy DeCarava, [HistoryMaker] Gordon Parks, you know, white photographers, you know; all kinds of people.  You learn, you know?
Story_ID: 227354
Speaker 1: Were you influenced most by anyone in particular?
Speaker 2: I would say Roy DeCarava, yeah, I would say that, Roy.  [Henri] Cartier-Bresson is--he's bad, you know?  I mean this guy's a--you know, it's powerful stuff.  And it's a lot of--photography has had a tremendous impact on this culture.  I don't think it gets--it's beginning to get--it's beginning to sell--they're beginning to sell, you know, it's considered an art now, and so you can sell--I mean I can get nine hundred dollars, you know, twelve hundred dollars for photos, you know, sometimes, and others are getting even more.  And with guys like, you know, [The] New York Times photographer--what's his name?  [HistoryMaker] Chester Higgins [Jr.] who's done several books in the spirit, this book, 'Songs of My People[: African Americans, A Self-Portrait,' Easter, Brooks & Cheers], the 'Million Man March' book; these books help because, you know, people finally beginning to accept that, hey, black photographers can do it, you know?
Speaker 1: Um-hm--
Story_ID: 227355
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm hoping that we can be more of a community; that's what I think needs to be happening, you know.  The community that I grew up in, there was a kind of feeling responsible; you could feel people wanting to--people concerned with your welfare, and not that that doesn't happen now, it just seems like, of course, these are much more complicated and--times, you know?  But I think that people have got to stop worshiping materials, and start, you know, getting into caring--just caring about themselves more, and about other people; that's what'll, will help, I think.
Story_ID: 227356
Speaker 1: And is there anything that you've already done that you wish you would have done differently?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I wish I had've, like, been--hadn't talked my way through English classes, and I wish I had been a better English student, and I would have been able to deal with writing better, you know; now, it's a hand--you know, it's a handicap, when you just can't sit down and do a proposal--do a story.  I mean, for example, a lot of times I work with newspapers and magazines now; I work with a magazine out of Rochester, New York called about...time, and if I could just get the discipline enough to go ahead and do the article, you know, along with the photos.  I mean, sometimes I actually--I'm running slides and I'm what's called producing, where I actually put the writer together, and we actually produce the piece, you know, for the magazine, you know, and you have a good editor, and you can do that.  I mean, I call her up, I say, "Look, we need to do this, this, and this."  And, you know, when we did the burial ground piece in New York [New York], I mean I went up there for two days and shot thirty rolls of film and sent the stuff up to her, and then she had a writer there who was there, and they put it together, and I got a cover shot.  Same thing with the celebration--the Brown [v. Board of Education 50th Anniversary Commemoration] celebration here in [Washington] D.C.  [HistoryMaker] Ossie Davis spoke.  You know, so you go, and something that's just one event, you can wind up, you know, making it something else.  I think more people are moving into doing their own stuff--producing their own music, doing their own productions, writers have produced--publishing their own books, and it's moving in that direction that we're independent.  I mean, I've been a freelancer, you know.  The last job I had, basically when I worked at Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] for a couple of years with the television station [WHUT-TV], and I taught on the faculty for a year or so, but I haven't really had a job, other than those two years, since 1971.  I mean, I freelance--work for myself--film, you know; little here, little summer thing here, but basically I work for myself.  And lot of that's happening, I think, but I just think we've got to bring the love back, you know what I mean?  I think we just got to bring the love back.  We've got to--more hands-on with our children; we've got to stop letting television raise them; we got to, we got to pay more attention to who they are associating with, where they are; we've got to know where they are.  My kids were coming up, I basically knew where they are, I mean with--even though I might not be there hand--right then, I would basically know where they were most of the time, and we've got to begin to realize that we can make a difference, you know?  Every person, every individual can make a difference, and you know, this whole thing, of not--I think there's kind of a feeling that a lot of people have, that they don't really make a difference anymore, that it--what they do does not--that accomplishment, the work satisfaction is not there; people are working on computers and all kind of automated systems that you don't ever see the finished product; it's all, you know, all you're doing's reports, which is not the same thing as creating a chair or a--or putting together a car, you know?  I mean, it's very detached, very remote.  And there is a lot of satisfaction, you know, I mean big satisfaction of actually producing something and that you get from actually producing something.  There's a product that you can say--that documentary, 'When We Were Kings', when that--when I first saw that film, I knew that it was gonna win an Oscar [Academy Award]; I told people who--my newspaper actually screened it the first year in Washington Forum [Theatre, Silver Spring, Maryland], and I said, "It's gonna win an Oscar."  I knew it would win because it, it was all--it was there, I mean, and it's a great film.
Story_ID: 227357
Speaker 1: And how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As someone who cared about life, about the world, about people, about changing things, making the world a better place and trying to bring some inspiration, some love, some life, some--bring something.  I mean, not just take, take, take.  And also someone who is--has a tremendous history--documentary history of these last forty years of black people that I've, that I've accumulated that is one of the largest of any one person.  I mean, I've got one of the largest archives; now, the thing is to take it to the next level and do something with it and put it--make it, you know, produce; make it be what it's supposed to--finish the job, you know, that's basically what I'm saying.
Speaker 1: And what's it supposed to be?  Like what would you like to see coming (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'd like to be able to walk up to the shelf and pull off 1972, and have, you know, everything there that I need to--I mean just--okay, I want this photograph of [Reverend] Dr. Martin Luther King [Jr.] that I first photographed with Dr. King within--on that balcony, and have--access.  I want it--stuff to be accessible, databased, archived, you know--listings.  I mean I've got in that bag there, a--you know, I have a listing of twenty-five pages of stuff that's in my collection--names by category; the rest of that needs to be more information about where and what other details of those people and those incidents, those events, you know.  And the musicians, the politicians, the--and I'm really moving to put that listing on the web--on--do a website on that so that--because people are looking for photos for newspapers, for magazines, for publish--for books, for your stuff, television--looking for photos all the time, and if they know that someone has this volume or this archive of stuff--I mean that's why I call mine [HistoryMaker] Roy Lewis archives.
Speaker 1: Um-hm--

Speaker 1: What do you believe your legacy will be?
Speaker 2: That--the history of these--from 1960 to '61 [1961] to whenever the last--because hopefully, I'll be taking pictures on the last day.  But that record and--that record is--that record, that history, this history makers that you all talk about, I have recorded a lot of those--a lot of people that you consider history makers; I have photographed them at different times, one time, several times, and so I've been like sort of doing a similar thing with stills and audio.  I used to audio record most of the rallies I went to or concerts and stuff, I always--I have a tremendous file of audiotapes, so that is the leg--that record of these people who make this history is what--I mean, you know, when I--my name drop off, the images'll still be there.

Speaker 1: Is there anything else you'd like to add, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [Roy] Lewis, that perhaps we didn't touch on?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, there's--this is a good amount, you know, and--but, you know, the thing is, is that I think people need to be--need to empower themselves and not accept other people's borders, you know, other people's stops.  But, I mean one person can do a lot.  I mean, I just look at--sometimes I look at the stuff, and I just don't even believe I did all those things, that I've took all those photos, but I did, you know, because I was basically driven; I had a sense that the '60s [1960s] and that whole cultural revolution thing that was going on--I--deep down inside, I was hoping it would go on, but I didn't--I knew that it wasn't, so I said, "Okay, somebody needs a record."  And I said, "We need to own it, or control that record," and that's what I've done.
Speaker 1: Great.  Thank you very much for your time, Mr. Lewis.
