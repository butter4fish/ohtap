Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe. I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Ma'am, could you please state your full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My name is Vel, V like in victory, E like in elevate, L like in love, and then Phillips, P like in Paul, H-I-L-L-I, P again, S [HistoryMaker Vel Phillips].
Speaker 1: Now Vel stands for a longer name I believe, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, it does.
Speaker 1: Do you care to give us that?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't mind at all.  My mother [Thelma Payne Rodgers] did not approve of my using Vel because my name is Velvalea, spelled V like in victory, E-L-V-A-L-E-A, Velvalea and I was named after my Aunt Velvalea [Velvalea Payne] who is a lovely, sweet person.
Speaker 1: Okay and do you have middle name?
Speaker 2: Oh, well my middle--given name?  'Cause now I use Rodgers which is my maiden name as my middle initial, but anyway on my birth certificate it would be Velvalea Hortense, H-A-R-T-E-N-C-E [sic.], Rodgers, R-O--R like in railroad, or, or like in rise O-D-G-E-R-S.
Speaker 1: All right and what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 2/18/24 [February 18, 1924], actually there's some, how shall I say--I, I can remember my mother and father [Russell Rodgers] discussing and arguing because the woman who took, did my birth certificate or something at City Hall [Milwaukee, Wisconsin], wherever it was done, was inebriated at the time and my mother said that she put the wrong thing on--but that, this was my birthdate, but I don't know what was wrong.  I have never said what on my actual--never, but this is what my mother said was my birthdate and so that's what I've gone by.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I think she was either a year behind or a year ahead, the, the woman that was inebriated, well drunk or had been drinking.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so there's that question of whether it was either, either--I--it, I, my mother said I was twenty-four but it could be that she put twenty-three because February she was--by that time she should've known because a month and a--almost a month and a half, but when you're, when you're not--you know, well if you're inebriated you can get confused so I don't know.  The birth certificate may have--the right one.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But my mother knew when I was born so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, we'll take your word.
Speaker 2: So but I--it's 24 that makes me an octogenarian, anyway.
Speaker 1: Okay and what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: You know what an octogenarian is?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: You had to be eighty years old (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yes ma'am.
Speaker 2: I'm sort of proud of it.
Speaker 1: Okay, ma'am what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm an attorney, a lawyer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I graduated from law school [University of Wisconsin Law School, Madison, Wisconsin].
Speaker 1: Now we're gonna get into that.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: But you've been a city council [Common Council] member of that too.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, oh yes I'm lawyer by--always.  I also was--been an alderman for nearly sixteen years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was a former judge.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we'll get into all that I'm a former--I have a lot of formers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Former judge, former secretary of state.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's for the State of Wisconsin, right?
Speaker 2: State of Wisconsin.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As I said I have a lot of formers.
Speaker 1: All right and what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Oh, today is December 2, 2007.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and we're doing this at the, the Conservatory of Music, Wisconsin Conservatory of Music [Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  I'm on the board here; because of a mishap in my own condo, and I'm hoping the people who did the remodeling will make, you know take responsibility for the damage that was done.  Things are kind of topsy-turvy, so we're here.  I'm on the board of--I'm a trustee here.
Speaker 1: Okay all right, now.
Speaker 2: And they--this is a lovely place and I only had to come next door.
Story_ID: 372961
Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five lightweight--
Speaker 2: I might say before I forget that if we have to come back I'm hoping we can then finish in my own home, but there wasn't time.  She said that this was the only day they could do it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Is that all right?
Speaker 1: That's fine.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Before we go into depth there are five lightweight questions that we ask as a warm up.  Management compels that I ask them and they only require a short answer.  The first question is, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Do I have a favorite food?  Not really.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not really, I mean--you mean a dessert or a main dish or what?
Speaker 1: Anything.
Speaker 2: I, I guess you could call me an ice cream-alcoholic.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I do like ice cream.
Speaker 1: Okay do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I like the fall shades, the rusts, browns, just soft tones, the beiges as you can see.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I like those, burnt orange, the fall colors of the trees are just absolutely glorious.
Speaker 1: Now do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: That's my favorite time of the year, September just before it's--when the leaves turn and before it gets really cold and.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother [Thelma Payne Rodgers], I remember my mother when she moved to California, strange as it may seem.  She missed the changing of the seasons you know definitely in the summer, winter and the snow and it was just sort of one season, and I can now have an appreciation for that because I do like the fall when the leaves turn.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Oh, I have my fondest memories when we all camped together.  We were tenters, we didn't have a trailer and the boys [Dale Phillips, Jr. and Michael Phillips] and my husband [W. Dale Phillips] and I would head for northern Wisconsin to some of the campsites and we do fishing and I remember we could even--there was a little place, a little stream of that you could bathe right in, in the water, the natural water.  It was just, those were some wonderful days we always had a campfire and we did all our cooking and we fished and, and it was just--and no phones, no disturbance at all just the nature and relaxation.
Speaker 1: Ok. Now, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: It's according to how you mean that?  I have a lot of favorite--I don't realize it but my friends would sometimes say something and then they'll say, "As you say all the time," thus and so and I say, "Oh, do I say that all the time?"  I had no idea but my friends or the people who I'm really, I'm very close but no, Cherry Hill and Frieda [ph.] and various ones, Millie [ph.] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay so you, you can't give us one that you?
Speaker 2: I was trying to think of it, Tiffney [ph.] said something that she said I say all the time but--you mean a phrase, you mean?
Speaker 1: Yeah a phase or saying you know it could be anything, something that's a favorite of yours.
Speaker 2: I usually use some of the same phrases that my mother always used but I'll be thinking about that and later on I'll tell you, if I can.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: How's that?
Speaker 1: All right that'll work.
Story_ID: 372962
Speaker 1: So right now I'm gonna ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about mother's side of the family and your father's [Russell Rodgers] side but we'll start with your mother's side first and get that side out of the way.  So can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes, her first name is Thelma, T-H-E-L-M-A and I think her middle name was Etha, E-T-H-A and her last name was Payne, P like in Paul, A-Y-N-E [Thelma Payne Rodgers] that was her maiden name.
Speaker 1: Okay and what was her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Aw, gee that's hard I wish I brought that with me.  Her date of--I know the December 6th I think.  Gee, I've forgotten, I could tell you that later.
Speaker 1: Was she born around 1900 or thereabout?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes it was, it was like 1906 or something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: And she was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back for first of all can you trace that side of the family?
Speaker 2: She had a very interesting background because I have seen pictures--and I don't have 'em anymore.  She lived in a--and I've gone back when I was on city council [Common Council of Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and I had an opportunity--I did less traveling than most of the alderman in--because I never liked to travel.  First of all my children [Dale Phillips, Jr. and Michael Phillips] were young and for two reasons, or three.  My children were young and I wanted to be with them.  I, when I was elected to the city council we had been married for about nine years and I was about five months pregnant and we had wanted children for a long time and then I didn't get pregnant until after.  Oh, first of all I had to have surgery, it's--to even get pregnant.  What they call a myomectomy and when I did get pregnant it was--we had been married quite a while.  I had fibroid tumors and they had to remove them and remove part of my--one--I only have one and a half fallopian tubes instead of two.  Well this is--I don't want to go into that it's so dull.
Speaker 1: Okay well we were talking about your ancestors.
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh but anyway.
Speaker 1: In Oklahoma.
Speaker 2: I--yeah but there was something else I was going to say, but in any event we were very happy to, to have children when, when we did, but my mother--there were five children in her family, two boys, Roy [Roy Payne] and Percy [Percy Payne].  I think Roy was older than Percy and I didn't ever know these--them real well so therefore I can't tell you much about them.  Roy, I (unclear) he--I've met, I've seen them both and I remember when they'd come to visit my mother.  I particularly remember that Roy was very good looking.  Percy married a woman by the name of Rose [ph.] in Beloit [Wisconsin] and I think she was Caucasian.  I'm sure she was Caucasian.  I remember her slightly because she was rather large, at least she seemed to me, large to me.  I was a young child and my mother always spoke very warmly of Rose because my mother thought that Percy, her brother, was a kind of a, a wanderer you know, just here and there and everywhere, and she thought that he didn't treat Rose as he should have you know.  She was always on the side of, of his wife more than--she loved Percy but she just thought he was kind of a philanderer or you know, in and out and all that, and I'd hear her talking to my father about how Percy wasn't taking care--he--Rose had I think four children as I remember, Ross [ph.], Lionel [ph.], Vera [ph.] or Victoria [ph.].  We called her Vera but you can--and Violet [ph.].  Four children by Percy and then mother said he--you know sort of left her with those four children and wandered off somewhere which she thought was scandalous.  She used that word a lot and then she--Rose married someone else.  I guess they finally broke up, and had at least four or six children, and some of them and of course think of me as, as related but actually I'm only blood related to the first four.   Ross who is gone, Lionel who is gone--all, all of them--Vera, the only one I think that's still living is Violet and, but then the other children by the second husband are all probably living and I, I have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And those are you cousins?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, but Vera came to live with us so I felt very close--her, her real name was Victoria, but Vera came to live with us when she, when we were quite young like maybe ten or so and she was very pretty and sort of athletic and we just absolutely adored her.
Story_ID: 372963
Speaker 1: How far back can you trace your mother's [Thelma Payne Rodgers] family?
Speaker 2: Well my, my--
Speaker 1: In Oklahoma?  How, far back can you go?
Speaker 2: This--
Speaker 1: How did they get to Oklahoma in the first place?
Speaker 2: Oh, that I wish I knew, but I do know that my mother came from a rather wealthy family, and I would when I was on the city council [Common Council of Milwaukee, Wisconsin], I went back to and saw the homestead.  It was just a beautiful, beautiful huge house.  It was sort of on a hill, but the whole neighborhood had been--what do you call it when they go back and refurbish it--put all?
Speaker 1: Gentrified or?
Speaker 2: Yes, put all the black folk out and it was all, it was all white then and I remember seeing pictures of my mother standing in front of that house and with a beautiful white little dress and all because they had oil money some kind of way.  How they had oil money I don't know but I know she had private tutoring, she didn't have to go to a school.
Speaker 1: Now did you have your--did you know your grandparents on that side?  Did you know her mother?
Speaker 2: Oh, I never had any grandparents at all.  I never had any grandparents because--
Speaker 1: So they had passed before you came along?
Speaker 2: Mm-hm and my mother, my mother's father who would be my grandfather, his name was Richard Payne and he was born on a Indian [Native American] reservation and I knew his tribe at one time because I had to give a speech for the church and I had a--I did some, had someone doing some digging for me but now I can't--and, and Velvalea [Velvalea Payne] for whom I was named, knew the name of the tribe and she told me but now I've forgotten.  It was a strange name and but Richard Payne was born on this Indian reservation and my, my mother's mother whose name was, my grandmother was named Victoria [Victoria Payne] and interestingly enough my--that would be my great-grandfather, my mother's father and mother was a bishop or, or something in the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church and he, he was sent to, to Africa.
Speaker 1: Was he a Payne?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Was he a Payne too, was his last name Payne?
Speaker 2: Oh, no I don't think his--well let me think?  Would his last name have been Payne?
Speaker 1: This is your mother's?
Speaker 2: No, see this was--Victoria was my mother's mother--Richard Payne.
Speaker 1: Okay, oh so this is a relative of Victoria, your mother's mother, your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay so your grandmother, her name was Victoria?
Speaker 2: Her name was Victoria and it was her mother and father.
Speaker 1: And what was her maiden name, do you know?
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: Victoria, your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Oh, I, I wish I knew.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 372964
Speaker 1: I, I'm going to before we leave here or before we finish I'm hoping to find out if there's a place that you can--Oprah Winfrey was talking about it, that you can check and get all of that information, you check your whole background, but Victoria [Victoria Payne]--my mother [Thelma Payne Rodgers] I remember when she would be combing my hair, brushing it and all she would talk about her mother who was Victoria, and Victoria was named Victoria after--because he was stationed--Victoria's mother, the bishop was Victoria's mother and father and they were stationed--see he had to go to Africa for the church [African Methodist Episcopal church] and Victoria died--and, and the name Velvalea came from something that was in Africa and oh, I'm I wish I knew more.  Victoria died in route back to Oklahoma and my mother said to me they buried her at sea and while she was--I was sitting at her--on the floor and she was brushing my hair and I remember so distinctly that she started to cry and the tears fell down on my head you know because she was thinking of her mother.  She said they lowered her into the sea and--
Speaker 2: That's on the way back from Africa?
Speaker 1: Mm-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And she began to cry and I, I remember the tears and whenever she cried then I would cry and so I remember that she said they were on their way back but, but she got sick and they decided to come back to Oklahoma City [Oklahoma] but she didn't make it--the trip, but the other interesting part was that Victoria had a sister by the name of Cynthia [ph.] and Cynthia was my aunt really, because she was my mother's--she was my great aunt, but she had been my great aunt.  See she was, yeah she'd have to be if she was my, if she was Victoria's sister.
Speaker 2: Right, that's right.
Speaker 1: And Victoria was my grandmother then, then.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's your great aunt.
Speaker 1: She'd be my great aunt, but anyway I think Richard [Richard Payne] died, I'm--this I don't know, who died first.  I should know that but either Richard died first or my grandmother, whoever died first the other one followed shortly thereafter.  If Richard died first, then Victoria died soon thereafter.  If Victoria died first, then Richard died soon thereafter, and they had, he had a--I remember this picture.  He had back then, he owned a restaurant and I saw--I see that picture--oh, I wish I had that picture of him standing by the restaurant.  They owned their own business and they had--there was quite a bit of money left.  Aunt Cynthia took over all the money and the--Roy [Roy Payne] and Percy [Percy Payne] were grown enough to be not around, but there were three girls, Aunt Velvalea [Velvalea Payne] for whom I was named, Aunt Naomi [Naomi Payne] who was the second one and my mother who was the baby, and this was when she was about eleven or twelve in that age.  Aunt Vel, according to my parents' conversation that we were not privy to, Aunt Cynthia ran through all the money and when she, when the money ran out she sent these three girls up north to Wisconsin because there were relatives that lived in northern Wisconsin.
Story_ID: 372965
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's how your mother [Thelma Payne Rodgers] to--
Speaker 2: To Wisconsin.
Speaker 1: --Wisconsin.
Speaker 2: And--some of this I know and when they got to Wisconsin up near Manish [ph.], or Minocqua [Wisconsin] or somewhere up in there, the relatives were all passing for white.  Now this I have no proof of, this is what my mother and father [Russell Rodgers] were talking about and they were not pleased to see these three girls who they presumed to be of African American heritage.  Actually, my Aunt Naomi [Naomi Payne] was very fair and could possibly pass, she could pass and my mother was very light skin.  She could pass also with--now this is a funny way of putting it but I can say this to you.  She could pass with, with white people, but a black person would kind of think, "Gee whiz, you know there might be a--something in the woodpile over there."
Speaker 1: I know what you mean.
Speaker 2: You know what I mean?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: So my mother is very light-skinned but she would give it--could, she could with white people.  However, my Aunt Velvalea [Velvalea Payne] for whom I was named would blow the whole thing 'cause she was the darkest of, of all, but she wasn't really that dark, but she was dark enough to know that she was not all Caucasian, and so they were not treated warmly to put it in a nice way and Aunt Velvalea married Uncle Joe [ph.] who was about twice her age at least, because they were not treated, they were not welcomed you know.  So she married and he, Uncle Joe, was a very sweet man, very light skin, but he was working in the resort places you know like maybe, I don't know cooking and whatever.
Speaker 1: Yeah up near Lake Geneva [Wisconsin] or someplace like that or (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Oh, no up in that Minocqua area is all kind of resort area, people had cabins and stuff and he was doing--he wasn't a professional or anything.  I think he worked you know, waiter or whatever--so whatever you do.  I'm just telling you what I understood.  I have no proof of anything 'cause I was too young but I would hear my parents talking that--well mother would say things like, "You know, Joe is just as sweet as he can be," talking about Aunt Belvier's [ph.], my aunt's husband, "he's just as, just a gentle old--but he's an old man because he was twice raised and he'll never be anything but a whatever he was you know," but and my father would answer by saying, "But yes he earned a living, a good--he, he took care of his children," and they had a three children.  Oh, I didn't--everything I forget.  Theda [ph.] who was the oldest--oh, god who was that good looking guy?  Earl--Earl [ph.] was very handsome because I remember he was in the [U.S.] Navy and came to see his, his Aunt Thelma and he was so handsome, Earl, Theda and Grace [ph.].  Grace was the baby and she was very pretty and they were all good looking as a matter of fact.  So they had three children and they lived in Indianapolis, Indiana 'cause they moved from the resort area and moved to Indianapolis.  My mother--
Story_ID: 372966
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your mother [Thelma Payne Rodgers] and her (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well where was I?
Speaker 1: You were talking about your mother's development and--
Speaker 2: Oh yes, it, that--what I was gonna say is so Aunt Velvalea [Velvalea Payne]--which my mother would talk she'd say you know, "Joe's [ph.] a sweet man but he's never going to do very much," you know and he took care of his family I'm sure, but he wasn't you know--well, there were not a lot of black professionals anywhere in that day anyway, you know.  He was not, not a professional.  Anyway, but he was--my mother would say I, I don't remember him really but my mother used to say how he was just a sweet old gentleman, but he was just old, she married someone twice her age and she should've done it and this and that.   So then Aunt Naomi [Naomi Payne] and my mother decided to head for the big city you know, which was Milwaukee [Wisconsin], and so they came here and they were about 14 or 15, say 15 and I got a job, each of them.  My mother got a job in a restaurant and she met--Aunt, my Aunt Kyra [ph.].  Well she wasn't a real blood aunt, they just were the dearest friends and they sort of went into the restaurant business together, although my mother didn't--probably a big hand until Aunt Clara--Uncle Harry [ph.] was not feeling good and so my father [Russell Rodgers] and mother took over the restaurant completely for about oh ten or twelve years, I don't remember, but that saw us through.  We were in the restaurant business when I was in college [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: So what was the name of the restaurant?
Speaker 2: It was called Clara's, Clara's Restaurant.
Speaker 1: Clara's, okay.
Speaker 2: Clara's Restaurant [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] it was on Walnut Street.
Story_ID: 372967
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Thelma Payne Rodgers] have a chance to finish school here [Milwaukee, Wisconsin]?
Speaker 2: Well, that's what I was going to say was, I don't know if she went to school anymore, but she had been tutored and she was always got to be.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right she was self--homeschooled, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was tutored, yeah.
Speaker 2: I always felt that she was highly educated.  My father [Russell Rodgers] on the other hand was brilliant, absolutely--we owned--they had all the encyclopedias and stuff like that, but he too I don't think had any actual formal education (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, let's, well, let's go to his side of the family and?
Speaker 2: Oh okay but let me just finish one thing.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: About my mom; so the three of them Aunt Velvalea [Velvalea Payne] was in Indianapolis [Indiana] and my mother, Aunt Naomi [Naomi Payne] and my mother were here.  My mother had three children and Aunt Naomi had three children, and we use to you know, we did a lot of sleepovers.  It was a wonderful, warm relationship we had, Aunt Naomi had--Marvel [ph.] was her first child, Florence [ph.] was her second child.  Both of those are deceased and William [ph.], her baby, her only boy is still living and but Aunt Cynthia [ph.]--see when, when, when both my natural grandparents died and Cynthia took them over until as the money ran out, but my mother never--my father would say kind of mean, well not real mean, but sort of derogatory things about Aunt Cynthia that she, you know she spent all the money and then shipped off the kids' stuff, but my mother loved her 'til the end because that was--she was a baby of the whole family and she was only eleven or twelve years old.  They say she was twelve and being orphaned at that time was very difficult, and so my mother felt one way and she insisted that she come to the wedding for--my sister had a big wedding also but Aunt Cynthia couldn't for some reason come, so my mother wanted her to come and she came but she had a boy and a girl, Aunt Cynthia and Rena [ph.] was a school teacher in Kansas City [Missouri] and I remember Rena well and she came to the wedding also and I just felt warmly about, about both of them because my mother did you know, but let's go to my father, 'cause that's--I know the least about his.
Story_ID: 372968
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Russell Lowell, L-O-W-E-L-L, Rodgers, R-O-D-G-E-R-S [Russell Rodgers].
Speaker 1: Okay and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Oh, god I don't know his date of birth, I have no idea.
Speaker 1: Was he older than your mother [Thelma Payne Rodgers] or?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was older.
Speaker 1: So what are you say six, five or six years?
Speaker 2: At least five.
Speaker 1: So maybe 1900 for him?
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: And where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in a little town called Phoebus [Virginia].
Speaker 1: Phoebus, like Phoebus in 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' [Victor Hugo]?  P-H-O-E-B-U-S, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, and that was right outside Hampton [Virginia].
Speaker 1: Oh, so Phoebus, Virginia.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right so how far back you trace his side?
Speaker 2: That I can't do much because I don't know what kind of father he had, I only know his mother was a dressmaker, and he didn't know anything about his father.  His father could've been Indian [Native American] or Caucasian because he was very good looking, straight black hair and--but he had the kind of Indian black darkness not the--which is a little different than a--he's kind of reddish dark, you know what I mean?
Speaker 1: Okay, so but, but his dad was unknown, he didn't know him?
Speaker 2: I, I.
Speaker 1: Nobody--
Speaker 2: I never heard any talk about his father.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I don't know, he only talked about his mother 'cause she taught him how to sew.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was, he, he was multi-talented that I know my father was.  He could take a car, he could take a car apart and put it back together again. For many years he had a garage on the South Side [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] where not many blacks on the South Side and he had a business on the South Side, so.
Speaker 1: So you're not sure what his formal education was either?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he was, had--very articulate.  Had an extensive vocabulary, so.
Speaker 1: Did he you know, he never--so he didn't go to Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia] or anything (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay or take (unclear), okay?
Speaker 2: Not to my knowledge.
Speaker 1: Now is--now what brought him to Wisconsin?
Speaker 2: I--you know I don't know, I have no idea what brought him to Wisconsin or how he met my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there's not a story about how they met or anything?
Speaker 2: I think not, I'll keep thinking.
Speaker 1: Okay. So they got married--well how soon did they?
Speaker 2: I'm getting sleepy.
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughter), I see, I see.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's 'cause I.
Speaker 1: You wanna pause a second, you need some water or something or you?
Speaker 2: Well, I think I'll be okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't get any sleep last night at all.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: So I do--I should get at least two hours.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Maybe it's because it's getting warmer in here.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  May be so, I hope it is.
Speaker 2: I hope so because, because when you're cold it makes you sleepy also.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  True.
Speaker 2: But anyway--

Speaker 1: Well, when you think about your parents' personalities--
Speaker 2: Oh, that's yes, that's very--I--that I can go--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I can go on because I never heard them ever, they never said an unkind word to each other.  They were very close and I, you know I didn't realize until I was you know grown and married how unusual that was.  I never heard him [Phillips' father, Russell Rodgers] raise his voice at my mother [Thelma Payne Rodgers].  I never heard her raise her voice at him.  My mother was very strong; my father was also a strong person but much more, less vocal you know.  He thought because he had three daughters that my mother should be the disciplinarian, you know?  And neither of them believed in corporal punishment so we never had any spanking or anything like that.
Speaker 1: Well, that's unusual for those days too?
Speaker 2: Yes, I, I didn't know that until now.  We never, ever had anything like that.  My mother, if I was chewing gum on the first floor, and not in--we could only chew gum in our room, she just had to look.  She just look, like, "How--you're chewing gum," you know and the gum would come right out.  She never had to really raise her, her voice.  She'd say things like, "Have you no shame?" If, if we did something, you know.  She was good at that, at that (laughter), I remember I was punished once because my sister and I when we'd be upstairs we'd say, "Oh sugar," that was our big thing and.
Speaker 1: Oh what?
Speaker 2: Sugar, we'd say, "Oh sugar," and we thought that was really something.  So I wanted to go to Esovelt's [ph.] birthday party and I had a brand new red taffeta little dress and I had tried it on and I was dancing around in the living room showing it to my sister, saying that I was going to wear it, and I think I passed by something while I was fiddling around it.  I thought I'd caught it and I said, "Oh su-," that's as far as I got.  I just got the su out.  My mother, "Have you no shame?" So I said--but my mother swore a lot and not to my father or anything, but when she and her friends were be talking about something or somebody, she'd say things like, "You mean to tell me that bastard did that?" Or something like that, you know.  She never used God's name in vain but she thought that was not right, but she used bastard and B-I-T-C-H and hell and damn and S-H-I-T and stuff.  I still spell it but it, I was--I'll never forget being punished because I was gonna say it.  Anyway, I was not going to say it and so then I said, "But I was gonna--."  "I know what you were going to say and I'm very disappointed in you, Velvalea [HistoryMaker Vel Phillips].  I'm just so disappointed, your father and I have tried to bring you girls up decent and all this."  So anyway, "But I was--." "I know what you were going to say, no explanations."  So then I was so desperate I said, "Well I do know those words because I hear you and Aunt Nellie [ph.] talking all the time, you know."  That was--, "You may take that little red little dress, march up the steps and go to your room, we will bring you your dinner."  So I remember hearing my mother, my sister sort of crying and saying, "I wanna go to the party too, but if Velvalea can't go I don't wanna go."  And my mother said well--she never gave in,  "If you wanna stay home just for--it's fine, neither of you will go the party," you know, but anyway I never heard my mother use any--I mean my mother and father had a wonderful, warm, understanding relationship.  That's why when I think about it, I, I came from an intact family, my father, my mother never worked.
Story_ID: 372970
Speaker 1: When I came to Milwaukee [Wisconsin] and was a, the lawyer in Milwaukee, a woman lawyer--there was a little group called Triple O [Organization of Organizations] and I shouldn't put this writing, but anyway Larry Harwell would say kind of little mean things about me.  I guess he didn't mean for it to be mean, but he said "Vel's [HistoryMaker Vel Phillips] not grassroots," you know people would say, "Oh we met Vel Phillips and she's a lawyer and this or that."  He'd say, "She's not grass, grassroots you know.  She came from an upper middle class family."  So I said I, my mother's [Thelma Payne Rodgers] always told me about how poor we were you know.  Now she--mind you I didn't relate this to the fact that she had come from an oil-money background and she had been tutored and that, and so when she said we were poor, she was using a different standard than other people.  So she was always talking we couldn't afford this and we couldn't afford that and we were very poor and had to you know. So I thought we were very poor. I thought that all the people that were my little friends were just like--they had the same you know as I did and I guess they were poor too, I didn't know.  So I came (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well it was the Depression [Great Depression] that you grew up in, I guess mostly.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so but I.
Speaker 2: And a lot of people were cash poor then right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah cash poor, so anyway that particular day I was so upset that someone had told me that my name had come up that I was a lawyer, "Have you met Vel Phillips, Velvalea?" 'Cause then I still was using Velvalea, and: "That she's a lawyer and this and that," and he said, "Maybe I have a thing about running for--," I ran for the school board and I was--I didn't make the primary but I didn't do any campaigning I didn't know anything about campaigning, so I would just go to Democratic meetings and stuff and say, "I'm--my name is, is Vel Phillips and I'm running for school board," and I didn't do anything. I didn't spend any money, I didn't have any literature.  I was--Royce--Henry Reuss [Henry Schoellkopf Reuss] who, who later on became the [U.S.] Congress person, was a friend of mine, Margee [Margaret Magrath Reuss], Margee and we were a professional couple and we got to be friends with this white--he was coming--came from a wealthy white family and he was a lawyer and my husband [W. Dale Phillips] was a lawyer and I was a lawyer and I, I had no idea that on this particular day I came home and I just was in tears because Larry had been saying, "Oh, I don't know.  She's not grassroots you know and everything," she came to (unclear) me.  I said, "I didn't," I said to my husband, "I said we were very poor."  So I'll never forget this we were in the kitchen and my husband said, "Honey, let's just examine this a little bit."  He said, "Did your mother work ever?"  I said, "Oh, no she never worked because she, my father [Russell Rodgers] use to say Mrs. Rodgers does not work."  He said and, and, "I take care of my own family (unclear)."  "Well did you own your home?"  "Oh, yes we owned our home," you know and then he said, "Did you ever have any, did you have help?"  I said, "Oh yes we had people--housekeepers and stuff to come in do the wash."  Sometimes my mother would do it but most times we had housekeepers, you know.  He just went through a series of questions like that.  He said, "Honey in the 1920s you know and '30s [1930s], that was not poor."  And I had never thought of that you know, I just was--my mother said we were poor and we were poor, but we did you know.  He said, he said, "You owned your home?"  I said, "Well I know we owned--I don't know how, when we started owning, but we owned it since, you know I, I can remember 2039 North 6th Street [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and how mother loved that house and everything and I know we owned that and how many," and so when he finished asking me those questions then he said, "You were not poor, you were all he said, but don't let that keep you from doing anything you want to do," that doesn't mean, you know.
Story_ID: 372971
Speaker 1: Because I remember when I met John F. Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy], we were talking once and in the White House [Washington, D.C.] and he was telling me some things and he said, "You know I was very fortunate, but my father [Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr.], when each of us was born we immediately were given a million dollars."  Now a million dollars it, it when he was born would've been like maybe five or ten million now you know, and so, so I know that we didn't have that kind of wealth you know, but for a black family to be you know own their home and have house keepers and never worked and everything, I guess that was considered an upper middle class family, but I didn't, wasn't aware of that and I didn't grow up thinking my--but the people, our little classmates always thought we were rich because different cars, we would be taken to school in an automobile, but these were cars that--my father [Russell Rodgers] had a garage on the South Side [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] which was unusual to be on the South Side.  He had a garage and these were cars that were he was working on maybe you know, I don't know, so but the people our little friends would march, tell us, treat us mean, "You think you're rich, you think you're pretty, you think you--," 'cause we had little fur coats and stuff, little you know and I--so what I was never taught that I was that way because my mother [Thelma Payne Rodgers] thought we was poor because according to her standard we were poor, see.  So I came up in that kind of home which makes me think when people marvel over things that I've done, and things that have happened to me, actually Larry [Larry Harwell] nothing more was expected of me than would be expected of a white family under, in my same circumstance you know.
Story_ID: 372972
Speaker 1: I truly admire--if you haven't interviewed Gwen Moore [Gwendolynne Moore], you should.  She's the first black person to be elected to a [U.S.] Congress from the State of Wisconsin and she's a wonderful, absolutely tremendous person.  She's real, she has a college degree and under all times--I'm sure poor, she was an unwed mother, you know.  I don't think she's ever been married and she has three children, and she is just one of the finest people and she always--when some people say still today--very recently as a matter of fact--there was a person who said some derogatory things about me in terms of, "Well Vel [HistoryMaker Vel Phillips] is, you know she belongs to The Links [The Links, Incorporated] and she belongs to--," you don't know what these groups are but you know, "She's a sorority person and she went to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] at a time when you know--," college, you know black young people were not going to college.  It was a big deal to be sent away to college, I guess.  It's a time I didn't even think was a big deal.  I had no idea it was--I won a scholarship and my mother [Thelma Payne Rodgers] had said, "You can go to the University of Wisconsin.  That's all we can afford."  Did not want me to go away you know and so I didn't think it was a big deal you know.  And, but when--that happened just recently and you know I was talking to Gwen Moore you know what she said to me, she said, "Vel--."  I said, "You know Gwen, I admire you so much because how you've been able to achieve when you didn't have, when you were an unwed mother."  I remember when both Gwen Moore and, and I received an award about four or five years ago from the Housing, the Milwaukee Fair Housing Council [Metropolitan Milwaukee Fair Housing Council] and we were at the Wisconsin house [Wisconsin Club's City Club, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] at the Wisconsin--yes, the Wisconsin house which is a beautiful, beautiful home on Wisconsin Avenue and it's a huge, huge, very ornate--there was, so it was a private residence but now it's the Wisconsin Club, it's called the Wisconsin Club and it has a wrought iron fence all around and Gwen Moore received her award before I did and got up and she gave a--I thought a very moving speech.  She said, "You know when I was trying to go Marquette [Marquette University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], I was at Marquette and I was trying to graduate from college,"  I think it's very close to Marquette University, she said, "I would come and stick my head as far as it could go between those wrought iron."
Speaker 2: Fence--yeah?
Speaker 1: Fences, yes.
Speaker 2: Yes, and she said and, "I'd see these beautiful big cars arriving and the people would get out all draped with furs and beautiful, beautiful gowns" and I would just say to myself, 'I wonder what's going on up in there?'"  Well, up in there is kind of a black term you know, and I said, "I wonder what's going on up in there you know and here I am now," she said, "I'm here at the Wisconsin Club receiving this award so I'm just honored not just to get the award but to be here in the Wisconsin Club."  So then when I got up to give my speech I was so moved by what she had said, I said, "Isn't it interesting that we have Gwen Moore here who has done so much?"  She's now--at that she wasn't in the Congress, I think.  No, yes she was in the Congress--I thought she was, but she was state senator, but she just been elected to the Congress and I said, "Now she has been elected to the Congress and she will be going in and out of the White House [Washington, D.C.], which is a far more prestigious building than this Wisconsin Club, and she won't have to wonder what's going on up in there because she will be a part of the whole scene as a--of the White House and the political arena."  I said, "She won't have to wonder," and I said that and she didn't forget that, because it was true--she, so I, I kind of now begin to resent in a, in a small way that people make so much of with the little I've done when I had every--I had a mother [Thelma Payne Rodgers], a father [Russell Rodgers] an intact family that loved us and treated us like we were little princesses.
Speaker 1: It's a--it is an advantage a lot of people don't have, you know but it's, you know you would think that these things could be taken for granted.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But it's an advantage a lot of people don't have.
Story_ID: 372973
Speaker 1: But tell me this, when you think about your parents' personalities and talents and dispositions, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think I have a little bit of both, but mostly if I had to say which, it was my mother [Thelma Payne Rodgers].  She was an unusual--because my father [Russell Rodgers] was so quiet.  We never hardly knew--only when my mother, when we were upstairs and we'd be sitting on the back stairway three or four, about four or five steps down and my mother would be in the breakfast nook, and she loved to play Solitaire and my father would be reading the paper and she would be, they would be chatting because he would be semi-reading and he would--she would be sort of playing Solitaire and then he would get up always and stand up straight and fold up the paper 'cause we were sometimes downstairs when that happened before we had to go upstairs.  So I could just see exactly what he was doing.  He'd stand up and he'd fold the paper and say, "Well, honey I'm going up now," and they had separate bedrooms.  He--we had, it was about a four-bedroom house or well, actually it was about five bedrooms, but that's another thing my husband [W. Dale Phillips] said to me:  "How many rooms were in your house that you remember?"  And I said, "Well, my mother's room, my father's room, my baby sister's room, and my sister and I shared a room and then there was another extra little--."  He said, "Well, that wasn't poor honey, that just wasn't poor."  So, but anyway, he would stand up and fold up the paper and he started to hit against his thigh, he said well, "I'm going up now," and then when he would come up, he would never go straight to his room, he'd, he'd stick his head--'cause when we knew he was coming we would scramble real quick and get bed like we'd been there all the time and then he would come and say, "I know you girls have been chatting."  He didn't know that we'd been sitting on the stairway.  He said, "But there's no more talking, you have school tomorrow and I want you--now it's sleep time."  So then we wouldn't say anything except we would whisper, so then he'd go and then my mother would come up and go to her room later, but in any event we could hear their conversations and they both sort of-
Story_ID: 372974
Speaker 1: When I wanted to go to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and my mother [Thelma Payne Rodgers] had promised me, she had said, "You can't go, we can't afford it," and all like that.  Then when she said--this is something that sort of shaped my life when, when I said, "Well suppose I win a scholarship?"  I said that to my mother and she said, "Oh, if you win a scholarship, well of course if you don't, if I don't have to pay and say we can't afford--."  So then I did, I won, I entered an Elk oratorical contest, and I won and John Daniels [HistoryMaker John W. Daniels, Jr.], who you interviewed--once when we were at a law, black lawyers [Wisconsin Association of African American Lawyers] meeting, their fundraiser was named after my husband, it was--their fundraiser was the W. Dale Phillips scholarship--they, you only had fundraiser a year.  Two years ago they changed it; it's now called VelanDale Scholarship dinner, which is my husband's name and my name combined.  But anyway, John got up and said, "You know I entered the Elk oratorical contest and I wanted to win to get a scholarship," he said, "but I didn't win," he was younger than me, "I didn't win," he said, "but I want you to know that [HistoryMaker] Vel Phillips who will be giving," I give the scholarship every year, "won the very scholarship that I did not win."  So when I won this scholarship I said, I said, now can, oh, I, I was just fancying around the kitchen, we had a huge kitchen.  I was going to be going to Howard.  My mother said, "You're not going to Howard, you're, you're," and I said, "But you promised."  Well she didn't care anything about rules like, if you promise a child--I mean Dr. Spock [Benjamin Spock] I guess hadn't even written a book--that you don't disappoint and change your mind.  She thought she could change your mind, she was very strong willed and she said, I said well, "Why?"  And she said, "Because I said so.  It's too far away and this and that."
Story_ID: 372975
Speaker 1: Now where were we?
Speaker 2: We were talking about the crisis, your mother [Thelma Payne Rodgers] telling you couldn't go to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]--
Speaker 1: Oh, yes I couldn't go.
Speaker 2: --After she said you could.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Right.
Speaker 2: And now listen you were jumping around the kitchen dancing and all of a sudden you get this cold slap in the face about this.
Speaker 1: Right, and I said, "Well mom you promised," she said, "Well--."  You know she never had to make (unclear) me.  "Mother's don't have to, we do, we make decisions that are in the, the best for you because we love you period, and I just think it's not a good idea."  You know, and so I was just despondent and I remember going up into my room and just crying really, you know that I wasn't going--because I thought, oh, Howard, I would, I would--everyone then, everyone at the whole school would be someone that I could associate with.  My mother always drew the line, this person was that person, and we just, we couldn't, we were not allowed to even come on Walnut Street [Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  We were not allowed to go anything where money was exchanged you know where money was exchanged.  We--the only exception she made when she would let us go to a matinee movie on Saturday afternoon where, that you had to pay money to get into the movie theater.  Other than that, if it was roller skating or ice skating or anything a party, a dance when some big orchestra band was coming and you had to pay to get in--we could not go 'cause she said it would be full, there'd be a lot of trash there you know (laughter) and so--off limits.  So anyway but the thing that was so funny was I heard them talking and my father [Russell Rodgers] said, "You are always, always, always--," she was a harsh disciplinarian and he was always the one that would kind of--he said, "Well, you know Velvalea [HistoryMaker Vel Phillips] is so, she entered that contest [Elks Oratorical Contest]," she--and because she didn't want me to enter the contest you know.  She would say things like, "Well, I don't know about those groups like the Elks and things--they, they weren't, they weren't select or anything.  Anybody could get in them and stuff like that.  So she talked down about them, see (laughter) and I was just--I wanted to do it so I entered and I did not win, and I have to tell you that story later.  Well, I'll, I want--
Speaker 2: Oh, that you did not win the Elks Contest?
Speaker 1: I did not, I did not, but.
Speaker 2: Now, I'm really confused, now I'm confused now--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --but, okay.
Story_ID: 372976
Speaker 1: But anyway, so then and she's and oh, my mother [Thelma Payne Rodgers] was, she had a temper and she was as I said, use the king's, it, it--you know she threw around swear words just--not, she didn't ever--my husband [W. Dale Phillips] could not believe that I had graduated from Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], had come back from Howard and never--certain things that I didn't know.  I had never heard the F word ever.  I didn't know there was an F word, you know, and he just like, "Where have you been?" you know, but the F word is used very frequently now but then, I could grow up in a, in a sheltered kind of existence and never hear it, and I didn't hear it at Howard.  They were, most of the people there came from the same kind of background I came from and they didn't use that word you know, so then when I met and married him, he--there was-- just all kinds of things that he would--he would joke about things like, he'd sometimes say, "What kind of hair is that you've got?"  He was talking about my hair.  He said, he said, "Grab it, it."  He was--it was so funny, he'd say, "Is it a good grade of bad hair or a bad grade of good hair?"  I said (laughter) because you know these expressions that blacks use about what was good hair was sort of Caucasian and what was bad hair was not Caucasian.  He said, "Is it a bad grade of good hair or a good--," and I said, he had figured out--he'd say it real fast so you wouldn't know but he had figured out which was worse.  He says, "I think it's a good grade of bad hair," which he thought was worse than a bad grade of good hair, and so I would laugh, and laugh and laugh and then he would laugh and we would laugh and then I'd say, it's better than what you have 'cause you got a bad grade of bad hair and then says that's what your mother and father left you and then he'd say, "Now baby you know I love you but now don't play that."  I said, "Play what?"  "The dozens." And I said, "The dozens? Like a dozen of eggs or something?"  I had never heard of that see and then he'd say, "God, where have you been, where you have been, that you'd never heard of the dozens, you know?"  And I said, "I don't know I've been right here you know, growing up in Milwaukee [Wisconsin]," and went to college and graduated but I never knew what the dozens were, and he was always kind of surprised at the things that I didn't know you know because I had, sort of really had a kind of sheltered upbringing, but in any event it got back to my mother.  Is that where you want--
Story_ID: 372977
Speaker 1: The Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] story, now well finish this story 'cause I'm sure if anybody watching this wants to hear the end of this story.  How did, what happened?  She, you, you won a contest [Elks Oratorical Contest] to get to go to Howard.  Your mother [Thelma Payne Rodgers] said you couldn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I, no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did not win.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did not win, remember I said.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my mother did not want me to enter this contest and I was only in the maybe the tenth grade or something, and that will be another story when we get to my childhood and my career, but anyway I entered the contest and my mother, we went to--we had to go to Chicago [Illinois] I think, oh, maybe the Chicago came to Milwaukee [Wisconsin] because Chicago--the Elk chapter, the Elk was, was, had some kind of connection Chicago-Milwaukee were connected you know.  They were--I know they were in the same region but they were connected some way and I got up, I wrote my own speech and everything, and I got up and gave my speech and my friends, my mother's friend heard them talking in the bathroom about who was to win, and the woman from Mil-- Chicago said, "Well, I know that, that young lady from Milwaukee was really the best one, she was good.  I have to admit, but it's Chicago's turn, it's Chicago turn.  If Milwaukee won last year, and Milwaukee won the year before whatever, and not it's Chicago's turn and I'm sorry, the person from Chicago is going to win and the regional and go the national," you know and my mother heard about it and I don't want to tell you what she said because I'd have to use some language that I don't care to use.  My mother said, "I knew that we should not deal with those low class, well folk because they--those Chicago people, they're all crooks," and now she--, "it was overheard that our baby, my baby was the best one and they still gave it to someone from Chicago because it was Chicago's turn."  She was just livid you know.  So the woman said to me, I remember this, "Now darling you were quite good.  Now, don't let this discourage you, you come back next year.  You come back next year and it's going to be just fine."  And my mother said, "I'm--she's not coming back next year, she don't won't have nothing to do with those low class people and she's not gonna do it," and, and so and so forth.  And my father [Russell Rodgers] said, "Thelma, I think you should let her decide whether she wants to come back next year.  She's growing into her own person and I think she should make the decision and you shouldn't.  If she wants, she knows how hurt she was, she knows how much she worked for it, she knows how embarrassed she was that she--so let--if she says that she doesn't want to come back then that's it, but if she wants to come back and try again I don't think you should deter her."  So they had it back and forth and back and forth.  So as usual my father won out.  Well I shouldn't say as usual 'cause he didn't always win out.  And my mother said, "Do you want to go back and do it again?"  I said I wanted to go back and do it again.  She said well, "I tell you there was a lot of low class people and this and that."  So then I went back and I won, and I went to the regional and I won and I got a four-year scholarship to any college or university in the county, including the [U.S.] Virgin Islands, or Haiti if I wanted to go and I was dancing around the room because I just thought it was wonderful.
Story_ID: 372978
Speaker 1: Now, I could go to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], then again--in a sense it comes out that my mother [Thelma Payne Rodgers] was very strong, but you see when, when they would get together my father [Russell Rodgers] would always sort of kind of win out.  So he said well you know, "Honey, you really promised," and we could hear them talking see?  "You really promised and Vel [HistoryMaker Vel Phillips] did work hard and think about it, she lost and she had the courage to go back the second time and hang in there."  Well you didn't use that term 'cause that's a term I--but something like that and so he said, "I think you should let her go to Howard if she really, really--she's so broken heart about it," and so my--she said, well he, then when my mother still protested, "Oh, I (unclear), it's so far away and all," then my father said, my mother finally said, "Oh," my father said, "But think about, you know just think about it and see what you think."  So she said, "Okay," well then they were talking between, we only would hear it when, you know here and there and so finally my mother said to me, and this is--and I tell you this because in a way it shaped my whole life for the next thing that happened to me.  She said to me, "I'm thinking you should, your father really thinks--."  She would never disguise her feelings you know?  She said I still would--, "Wisconsin has one of the finest universities in the country and I think that you should go and be close to home where I can see you and you can home for weekends.  It would be wonderful."  They were very disappointed when my older sister [Yvonne Rodgers Curry] decided not to go to college because I could, we could tell when they talked.  My mother would just almost weep because she married her childhood sweetheart and she wanted to get married and she wanted to get married right away and she said and my father said, "Well he's a fine young man.  He's going to go to college.  She just wants to be a housewife," she went into home economics.  She was a dietician, a very excellent dietician, but anyway she said, she said, "I think that since she has no desire to go to college whatsoever," and he, he would write out, my father's very--and he would write out what we should take and he did it for my sister.  I remember math, the sciences, a foreign language, Latin because it's a, a good base, he and these are what you take and then there was such--Ms. Floyd [ph.] who was our high school advisor [at North Division High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] was very, very racist and, and my sister came home and said, "Ms. Floyd said I shouldn't take all these courses and I agree with her because I wanna--I'm just going--I wanna be a housewife and a mother and all that and I don't want any of that.  I'm not going to college and I don't want those courses," and so we were only just behind a year and so she took, she didn't go to college.  She got married, and she had a child ten months after she got married.  So now here I am and so my father said, "Well I think you should let her go to Howard."  My mother said to me, Larry [Larry Crowe] this is the thing that was important, she said, "Your father thinks that maybe you'll be all right if I let you go.  I've decided that there are three very basic rules that you must follow and if you promise and look at me straight in the eye," she was always talking about straight in the eye, she always said to me you (unclear) if a person--you, "You are not to look down on anyone as you're better than them.  You're not to look up to anyone that they're better than you because you can do anything you want.  Just meet then eye-to-eye and know that, that person is your equal in every way as long as they bleed and everything else--they breathe just like you and they can be just as--you don't have to look up to anyone, but you don't look down on anyone."  So then--she was always, had these little basic rules that we were to live by.  That whatever, now that was just one them, 'cause she had a million of them, but anyway she said, "If you follow these three rules, if you're willing to agree to these three things, I will let you go to Howard."  Well I was ready to agree to anything to go to Howard.

Speaker 1: So I said, "What?"  She [Phillips' mother, Thelma Payne Rodgers] said, "There be no smoking of any kind until you graduate from Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], until you walk across the stage and get your diploma. Then if you care to smoke it's all right, because otherwise good girls don't smoke."  She had this rule.  Well I didn't smoke.  She, now she wasn't talking about drugs or anything, she was just talking about Camels or Chesterfield or whatever you know, and so since I didn't smoke that didn't seem.  I said, "Oh fine," I readily agreed and then she said, "There will be no drinking of any kind of alcoholic beverage, wine, beer--it's a punch if it's spiked with wine--of any kind while you're in college.  When you graduate then you may have a glass of wine or something."  Well since I didn't drink anything, we never had anything to drink, that didn't--I had no idea they had wild parties in the dorms and there'd be plenty of liquor and it would be hard to resist you know or that they'd be smoking and all like that and I had no idea that, that would be a difficult thing so I agreed right away.  Now, after we were growing up since we lived near the lake--in Milwaukee [Wisconsin] which had a lake, was on the lake.  She'd say--I, I remember when my sister [Yvonne Rodgers Curry] was beginning to date she would--and then when my sisters, and then me and then my baby sister.  "If you're in an automobile and the young man starts driving east, now he could be going anywhere, east toward the lake--he could be going not to the lake for funny business.  If he starts driving east towards the lake you sit straight up in the car, put your shoulders back and stick them on your back, because he's up to no good, and be wary."  And I said, "Oh," and so I knew what that meant because she'd preached that to my sister before me and she said, "You must remain a sweet girl," and so I finished the sentence, "Until I graduate from college," which the other two had been (unclear).  She said, "Oh no, you must remain a sweet girl until you marry."  And I said well I sort of knew what that meant you know, no fooling around and stuff.  So she said, "Do you think you can follow that?"  Well it seemed easy enough, I'd never been you know.  I said, "Oh, certainly," you know, so then off to Howard I went (laughter).
Story_ID: 372980
Speaker 1: And I remember, we went to, all the--Truth Hall [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] was this, was the dorm for, for the freshman; and my mother [Thelma Payne Rodgers] took me to college and I'll never forget when we, we--she said, "We do not have enough money to fly, we're going on the train," and she had always told us that when the train stopped in Chicago [Illinois] that I just thought Chicago had, I felt, I actually thought that if you got off in Chicago there'd be men standing there with guns, you know.  It was just (laughter) it was: "Do not get off the train ever.  If you're going, if you take the train somewhere, don't get off in Chicago because you will be accosted and people will--they're ju- terrible people, a lot of gangsters live in Chicago," and stuff.  So I, so we were on the train and this, the train stopped in Chicago and a lot of freshman with (gesture) 1946 Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], 1946, which was--would be our graduating year 'cause this was '42 [1942]; and there were about oh, a bunch of them--five, six of them or so you know and they were just laughing and, and just being, being their age, but they were--Mother said that she saw a bottle being passed around and she said to me, "You see that, that's not--they're going to Howard and you're going to Howard.  Just because they're going to Howard doesn't mean that they're not trash; they're trash because they're carousing, they're loud, they're drinking, probably smoking and you do not associate with any of those people who are on that, that." And I remember having to go to the bathroom and had to pass by this group. "Hey!" they said, said, said, "You with your momma, huh?"  That's the first time I knew it wasn't so good to be with your momma (laughter).  "I see you got your momma with you," you know.  "You got big eyes, but you got your momma with you," and so I was just, boy that made me feel pretty good you know, is that I had, they had said that I had big eyes or something; and, but I then thought, oh gee, it wasn't cool to have your momma with you, and so I said, "Does everyone's parents take them to college?"  I thought everyone's parents--she said, "But they probably don't have any parents if, some of them are probably drunk or in the tavern," you know (laughter).  And I got to be friends, real close to all of them especially Mamie Hansberry, because Mamie Hansberry was--oh, oh when we were, the last day my mother said, "Well we're gonna move--," all the other parents, "and we're gonna visit the rooms."  Now she had no pencil or paper with her, and we started from the third floor and the second--all, all the floors and we're going--and I remember Mamie Hansberry because she had on a little, she was smoking a cigarette and when we got back to our room, my mother said, "Now in," and then she named the numbers, "in 214 there was a girl, a young lady there, she was smoking a cigarette; do not associate with her. And such and such a person, the young lady that was from Ohio her name was Zoe Crumpler [ph.]," and the reason my mother said, "do not associate with her," and the reason was, think of this reason, because Zoe--her mother was still there, like my mother was still there, and Zoe, who I loved, from Youngstown, Ohio called her mother by her first name.  "Oh, Bernice [ph.] would you hand me such and such," or whatever her name was.  My mother--oh!  So she was on the list because she called her mother by her first name and her mother said, "Oh, okay baby," you know. That was, that was their little thing.  Her mother maybe said, "You can call me Bernice," or whatever her name was, and, and so she called her mother by her first name.  My mother thought that was outrageous, and so she was on the list.
Story_ID: 372981
Speaker 1: Anyway as soon as mother [Thelma Payne Rodgers] left as luck would have it, Mamie [Mamie Hansberry] and I became very close friends and I was her bridesmaid at her first wedding she--
Speaker 2: Now where was Mamie Hansberry from?
Speaker 1: Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Okay, is she related to--
Speaker 1: The Hansberrys.
Speaker 2: The other Hansberrys there?
Speaker 1: Yeah, her father [Carl Augustus Hansberry] was in real estate or something like that.
Speaker 2: Yeah and her.
Speaker 1: They had plenty of money, when (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Her uncle would've been teaching at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] then, right, William Leo Hansberry?
Speaker 1: He, he may have been, but not when I was there I don't think.
Speaker 2: Yeah he was (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well sometime--that was you know I'm sure, but anyway Mamie had a sister--I had a baby sister and Mamie had a baby sister and Mamie's baby sister was Lorraine Hansberry, the Lorraine Hansberry who wrote 'A Raisin in the Sun.'  No, yes, she wrote, she was the Hansberry, and Mamie would talk about her little baby sister and I'd talk about my little baby sister.  I said, and I was Mamie's bridesmaid in her first wedding, in her--she married about three men, you know.  I saw her recent--I've got to give some money to the Hansberry-Sands Theatre [Hansberry-Sands Theatre Company] and, and then send it to Mamie.  I hope Mamie is still living.  I saw her about ten years ago, she was gorgeous.  Still the same old Mamie Hansberry and she said, "Vel [HistoryMaker Vel Phillips] you look wonderful," you know.  It was just a wonderful warm thing. Anyway (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)Okay.
Story_ID: 372982
Speaker 1: Should we go back to childhood and try to figure out some of this and then we'll try to go get back to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, but I just.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that was, that gives you some idea of.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Of the kind of mother [Thelma Payne Rodgers] I had and father [Russell Rodgers] and how they talked, everything (unclear).
Speaker 1: How long did she stay at Howard when she brought you, I mean did she stay?
Speaker 2: Oh, she stayed the whole parents weekend, you know the whole thing, you know they had it all planned where the mothers would stay and everything.  She stayed the whole--it was like a two or three day thing, you know, and she stayed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know and she stayed and she picked out those people that I should--and Billy Rhetta [ph.] and George Anderson and Clara [ph.], oh I can't remember Clara's last name, all those Howard, Chicago [Illinois] people, I, we became fast friends, you know.  I just had to not, you know mother was--I, I followed some of the things. The things, those basic rules that she said, no liquor, to this day that's why I said, "Check my life."  To this day, to this very moment I've never had any alcoholic beverage in my life because after I had got through Howard, it no longer was you know, I got through Howard well, I just didn't have any desire to take it out.  Anyway, after I can't remember now, but after maybe a year or so or two--I was always embarrassed when people would offer me--they'd say you know, "Vel [HistoryMaker Vel Phillips] will you have--?"  We'd be in a room or a big party.  I'd, "Oh, nothing thank you," and then someone would say, "Well, Vel doesn't drink, she doesn't drink anything."  Well people would say, "Well, you don't drink what's the matter, why don't you?"  I said, "Well I promised my parents that I would--."  "Well, they're a thousand miles away for god's sake you know, why don't you try a little of this?"  And I said, "No, but I, I promised," and so I kept that word and then after about a couple of years or whatever I began to feel that I was a little special.  That I got a little special attention and, and it wasn't like a put down, it was, "Oh Vel, oh you don't drink?"  And some people would be kind of impressed, "Oh, well have you never--do you have something against it?"  I said, "Oh no, it's just that I promised my parents," and it was something (unclear) you know and then I began to kind of think it was kind of nice to be my own, have my own thoughts and my own--be my own person kind of thing.  So then, I didn't--so I didn't smoke, I didn't drink and I have to tell you later on about remaining a sweet girl.  We'll get to that later (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, okay.
Story_ID: 372983
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well let me, I'm going to go back to childhood now (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, go back to childhood.
Speaker 1: You told us something about the house you grew up in, but what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all we, we were never in a place--that's why I really wanted to go to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  We were never in a place where there a lot of other black people.  We always--our neighborhood was always very integrated.  We went to North Division High School [Milwaukee, Wisconsin], we went to Garfield Avenue grammar school [Garfield Avenue Elementary School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], which was--had, I think my sister [Yvonne Rodgers Curry] and I may have been the only ones in the school.  Then we went to Roosevelt Junior High School [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] now there were several blacks there but not a lot, you know.  Then from there we went to North Division High School and all the blacks went to Lincoln [Lincoln High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  There were only about a dozen blacks in the whole school, all the grades.  So for some reason we were never in a place where there were a lot of us and that was one of the reasons.  I met a Ms. Young, I can't think of her--Jean, Jean Young [ph.], at the Urban League [Milwaukee Urban League, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  The Urban League was one of those places that I could go, we couldn't--you didn't have to pay to go to the Urban League so as long as money wasn't exchanged, I could go to the Urban League and I was in a little play and I did--it was you know I always did things at the Urban League and I could also go to the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association], 'cause you--no money was exchanged and I was in the Girl Reserves [Girl Reserves of the Young Women's Christian Association], there was something called the Girl Reserves and stuff like that.  Anything like that, that was a--and I took--we took dancing lessons.  I rebelled against piano lessons, and I'm sorry but I did.  My mother [Thelma Payne Rodgers] said, "You're gonna be sorry.  You're gonna be sorry you, you--."  It's nice to know music but we took dancing and all those things.
Story_ID: 372984
Speaker 1: Yeah, you were talking about the schools and the activities that you were involved in when you were growing up like the Girl Reserves [Girl Reserves of the Young Women's Christian Association], Urban League [Milwaukee Urban League, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: You talked about a Jean Young [ph.] at the Urban League.
Speaker 2: She's the one that had been to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and, and said that you must--, "Oh, Howard is lovely and this and that," so then I got turned on to Howard.
Speaker 1: Oh, 'cause she's the one that introduced you?
Speaker 2: Jean Young, oh, yes, her name was Jean Young and she was a Delta [Delta Theta Sigma Sorority] and I knew nothing about sororities because I didn't love Kitty Roryat [ph.], she remembered Kitty that person I'm talking to because she was from Texas and she became a doctor and, and she remembered Ann Hines [ph.] and Kitty Roryat they were my mentors and I aspired to be a mentor.  To be a mentor means that you're, that you're, you were really--that was a big success.  You can't--they, they wanted only the best of the class to men- to be a mentor and live with the, the seniors but they didn't want people who were known for drinking and smoking or carousing or anything they, they really wanted--and see I didn't realize that at the--I just knew that to be a mentor was would be wonderful.  I didn't really understand that you--it meant that your morals and everything--I didn't understand it.  I didn't get that, I just thought that it was something to aspire to.
Speaker 1: So you became a Howard mentor?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes I was a mentor.
Story_ID: 372985
Speaker 1: Now I wanna just suspend Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] for a second and take you back to--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --growing up again and just, were there any other than Jean Young [ph.] and we talked about her, but were there any other teachers?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Or people that were like a mentor or, or.
Speaker 2: And that influenced me.
Speaker 1: To you that influenced you?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes I absolutely adored--well first of all I have to start with my third grade teacher [at Garfield Avenue Elementary School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].  Her name was Margaret Borkowski and the reason it stands it out to me is many, many, many years later about, I'd say about ten--about fifteen years ago because--I'm trying to think, I don't think my husband [W. Dale Phillips] was living at that time, 'cause he, well it was close around that time because he died in '88 [1988], so this would have been, I, I can't remember.  I'd have to see exactly.  They started a program at the University of Wisconsin [University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin] here in UWM 'cause the main, really the main campus was UW-Madison, and now but Milwaukee [University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] is, is big or bigger than, than Madison I think, but it's still the main campuses.  It's UWM, I mean UW Madison, but anyway they started in Milwaukee [Wisconsin] what they call a tribute to teachers and they came to me and they wanted to use names of people who had made an impact in Milwaukee and were known.  So they came to me and said, "We would like you to pick out your favorite teacher," because it was the first time they've had it.  They didn't plan at the time to repeat it, but it was such a success that they've had it ever since.  I could check with the school of education and find out the history.  I'd like to do that because this was the first time they had done it and they said, "Could you think of a favorite teacher that was--," and they said--Dreyfus, Sherman Dreyfus [Lee S. Dreyfus] who was the governor at the time he may, I think he was the governor at the time.  So if he was the governor, or maybe, maybe he was no longer the governor.  That--let's see if he's the governor then I'd know that my husband was still living, but if he was not--'cause my husband was living when I was secretary of state but I, I you know I get these years mixed up but anyway since I think he was no longer governor.  I cannot say but it was way back 'cause he--I was secretary of state between '72 [1972], '74 [1974] and '76 [1976] I think.  No, that is when I was on the bench. Do you know when I was?
Speaker 1: Yeah I do, I--but well, tell the story (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, secretary of state was '78 [1978], '82 [1982], '78 [1978], '82 [1982].  So it could've been, it was, it was I think after he was no longer governor and so it could've been like '84 [1984] or '85 [1985] or somewhere in there and then my husband was still living, but in any event I said, "Well my favorite teacher would be no longer living."  That's what I told the reporter.  She said, "Why?"  I said, "Because she was my third grade teacher, and I said I'm you know sixty-five or seventy," whatever I was at the time, and, "I don't think my third grade teacher would be."  She said "Oh, I would love it because we, we got people no, nobody has done an elementary school teacher."  Most of the people that they had contacted to do their story on their favorite teacher and which did were not elementary, and she said, "Well just, let me just see if I can reach her."  Well sure enough they found Margaret Borkowski, and I know now my husband was living and I'll tell you why.  They found Margaret Borkowski and I think, and they called her and said, that Velvalea, no that [HistoryMaker] Vel Phillips said that you were her favorite, one of her favorite teachers and then she said to them, "Oh, Velvalea," you know and so they said, they said she's now you know eighty-nine or ninety years old, but she sound her mind sounded like it was just clear as a bell.  So that night, oh, I gotta get that TMJ [WTMJ-TV, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], the guy who's with TMJ he gave us a little lecture beforehand and he said, "Now you got to remember this is a tribute to teachers, you're not the main show."  'Cause they wanted people who were, had been in public life and were well known and stuff so but they wanted to let us know that, that it wasn't our show you know, it was for, it was a tribute to teachers.  So you can take--you, every--they had say six people I think or maybe five, maybe five people, whatever.  We had fifteen minutes each of us so, fifteen, fifteen, four would be an hour and fifteen minutes for this part or an hour, even an hour and a half.  They may have had six people, because as long as they are different people the, the time doesn't seem long and you see what I mean?  So they had I think six people and the whole thing would be an hour and a half for the presentation, but you have only five minutes to talk about why this was your favorite teacher.  The teacher had ten minutes to talk about whatever she wanted to say.  It could have been a little less, it could've been I had four minutes and she had--but I think it was five minutes I had to talk and she had ten minutes and break it down that would be an hour and a half for the whole part, but the people said it was--the breakdown was, you know, every--fifteen minutes apart with different speakers because you had two different speakers within the fifteen minute thing and it made it go fast and the people loved it and then decided they'd have it again the second year and now they've had it every year since.  So if I check it'll be maybe the seventeenth year or something (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well--
Story_ID: 372986
Speaker 1: What was it that you liked so much about Ms. Borkowski (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Margaret Borkowski, well she was--I found out after--when that happened that she was very young.  That way back then she could be a teacher.  She had just graduated--she had graduated from some small--like a take-a-two-year education course or something and she graduated from the old state teachers college [Wisconsin State Teachers College-Milwaukee; University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and say she got outta high school when she was seventeen if she was really smart and then she was there at state teachers college for another two or three years and so she was maybe nineteen when she came to be the, the third grade teacher at Garfield Avenue School [Garfield Avenue Elementary School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and she just loved me and I could never--I remember saying to my mother [Thelma Payne Rodgers] I didn't understand and it was so confusing for, for me because when we would go to recess there--in Milwaukee [Wisconsin] there were three Schuster stores [Ed. Schuster and Company, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], they were big department stores and the one that was, the Schuster store across, that, that was across the street from Garfield Avenue School housed when the Christmas parade came, the Santa Claus and reindeer and all that, were garaged in across the street at the Schuster and I'd go for--and it would be cold wintertime 'cause it was Christmas and I would be cold and I would not want to come in 'cause I would just want to see if I just heard a bell, if I heard a little tinkle and I, or, or sometime you could, the, the, the sleigh would be coming in or out or people all dressed in you know, it was just all so fairy tale and I would just stay there until I saw something, and I would be very disappointed and I'd be waiting for Santa Claus 'cause sometimes you'd see the--they go in and out on those things you know and, and maybe once I remember I was there when the whole sleigh came out with Santa Claus and everything and I thought that was the Santa Clause of course that was for the whole world.  Anyway, Ms. Borkowski would call me and she, it was always the same.  She'd say, "Velvalea [HistoryMaker Vel Phillips]," you know, "it's time for--the recess is over," you know, "it's time to come in," and it would be a very calm nice voice.  Then the second time she'd call me it would be, "Velvalea, it's time to come in."  You know it would be just a little more and I would just, I hadn't seen Santa Claus and I would just it's like she hadn't said a word, but I always knew when it was the third time 'cause she was like, "Velvalea I said come now," you know, and then I would be upset and I'd run as fast as I could and that was the thing to start with.  As soon as I got to her and I knew her voice was, was impatient and very stern, but soon as I got there she would just look me and she'd put her arm around me.  "I know Santa didn't come, but that's all right, he will come.  You'll see him tomorrow, there's tomorrow."  She would be very sweet and she said, "Now get in line," and, and she would be just loving you know and I didn't understand that.  I just didn't understand how could she sound, "Velvalea," and then when I get there she would just put her arm around me.  So I said to my mother, I said, "I don't know why she does that Ma, why, what is it that makes--she's very angry when she calls me the third time, but then when I get there she just puts her arm around me?" And my mother said, "Oh that's because she loves you."  "Now you know I have to be stern with you and I have to discipline you and say when you're chewing gum or doing something that you shouldn't do it, or eating your food too fast or something," and she said, "but it doesn't mean that I don't love you and she loves you," that's what my mother was telling me, and then my sister would pop up and say, "Well that's because you're (unclear)--you--Vel you believe in Santa Claus I told you there was no Santa Claus," you know (laughter), "but she believes everything, she thinks Santa Claus is Santa Claus, that's just a made up thing," and then my mother's such a--my mother would get there, "You all, would you please, please.  Now if she wants to think about Santa Claus the way she thinks about Santa Claus let her be," you know and she would chastise her.
Story_ID: 372987
Speaker 1: So I told--so, so I just knew she [Phillips' elementary school teacher, Margaret Borkowski] loved me you know and, and I never did--so when we got up to tell our part I said--I didn't do, tell that so I was going to tell that story but then I told the story when I met with the, a few people and I was thinking about running for secretary of state and I said, they said, "Well Vel [HistoryMaker Vel Phillips] I don't know, I don't think you could make it. There's never been a black person that's ever won a statewide election and I--why did you pounce of secretary of state?" 'Cause they said, you know, of course was the dullest job I ever had, but I liked the secretary of state because I had gotten to be an alderman because the secretary--then secretary of state--Wisconsin had not reapportioned for thirty years.  You're supposed to reapportion every three, every ten years, every decade and the secretary of state, his name was Zimmerman [Robert C. Zimmerman], some German guy, and he insisted that there are, because Milwaukee [Wisconsin] was raising a lot of hell in the newspapers, the Journal [Milwaukee Journal; Milwaukee Journal Sentinel] and the Sentinel [Milwaukee Sentinel; Milwaukee Journal Sentinel] both which were separate at the time were saying that they were having to count the cows up north and the trees in order to equal that--Milwaukee as the most densely populated area of the state was being cheated.  So I got introduced, I joined the League of Women Voters [League of Women Voters of Milwaukee County, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and that and that was the thing in my little area where I lived, above a drugstore which my mother [Thelma Payne Rodgers] frowned upon that I was living on Walnut Street.  "Oh god," she couldn't stand to think, "I'm not going to church I'm just so embarrassed," such and such.  "It seemed I saw your middle baby going up some steps on over a drugstore on Walnut Street.  Where was she going?"  And I said--my mother said, "I don't know these young people, I don't know where she was going."  And I said, "Mother, you should have told her I was--that's where I live.  I live above a drugstore on Walnut Street."  Anyway I get back I told the story they said, "Well you could never win for secretary of state, Vel we got to get the South Side [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and there are a lot of Skis on the South Side."  So I said, "A Ski? I never heard of a Ski," and they said, "You never heard of a Ski? Well that's all those Polacks over there, those Polish people.  Their last name ends in S-K-I and they are very racist over and (unclear)," and I was just about to buy that until I thought, well what about Margaret Borkowski?  I remembered her name, I knew how to spell it, B-O-R-K-O-W-S-K-I.  And I said, "Well what about Margaret Borkowski?"  And they said, "Well who is Margaret Borkowski?"  I said, "She was my third grade teacher [at Garfield Avenue Elementary School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and she loved me dearly, she loved me.  She would let me stay as long as I could to see Santa Claus."  They said, "Well Vel--." "No," I said, "no, they--we can't just sell them down the river," and we decided after I made that, "Well maybe you could do it," and then I said and the rest is history, 'cause I became the secretary of state (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So that teacher made that big a difference that--
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.
Speaker 2: --stayed with you the rest of your life.
Speaker 1: It stayed with me because they were talking about the Skis.
Story_ID: 372988
Speaker 1: I didn't know what the Ski, I had never heard the term, and when they said that it was these Polish people that lived on the South Side [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] that would never vote for a black person, that they were all racist, I said, "Well but gee, there was Ms. Margaret Borkowski," and so when I had my five minute segment, I said, "There are many stories I could tell you about Ms. Borkowski and why she had such an effect on me."  I said especially the story when she would let me--I would just explain the (unclear) would let me stay as long as I liked when the Santa Claus was garaged across the street in the Schuster's [Ed. Schuster and Company, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] building.  I said but the story I liked best is when I decided when I was just contemplating running for secretary of state [of Wisconsin] I was told that I could never get the South Side because of a lot of Skis and that they were all racist and that kind of thing, and suddenly it hit me that Margaret Borkowski was my third grade teacher [at Garfield Avenue Elementary School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], and she loved me and they couldn't all be bad, because her name ended in -ski and so I decided to run for secretary of state and the rest is history.  I won and I went on to you know I just, it just gave me.  I went on to do all kinds of things and, and she was--if I have any success it had a lot to do with Margaret Borkowski, so now it was her turn.  By then when she came to the podium, I mean she was standing--the teacher had to stand beside you as you told your part and these little tears came down and I noticed that everybody was just quiet like everything when I was talking, and I thought you know it was because I was making such a good speech and stuff, but they're also, they were also looking at Margaret Borkowski who, was just, tears were just coming down, you know.  Because then when I finished, then I turned to her and I, she was wiping her eyes just like that you know and I just--it made me cry you know and she got up and the first thing she said was "I just--Velvalea [HistoryMaker Vel Phillips]," and see people didn't know, very few people knew at that time that my name was Velvalea.  She said, "Velvalea was the sweetest child" you know, and the tears, and the audience was just enrapt you know and I was just blown away you know so it, it's--she just recently died, but her whole family was there.  She had a whole table and she was being awarded, getting the award and her children and her mother, all of her family was there, you know, and it was quite, it was quite a, a--I'll never forget it and it was such a success that they now do it every year and they're in their seventeenth or eighteenth year.
Story_ID: 372989
Speaker 1: But she had a great influence on me and then the other teacher.
Speaker 2: You're talking about the second teacher?
Speaker 1: Oh, yes the second teacher that influenced me you know in a sense.  Well there was three teachers really that influenced me, but the second--well, let's just go with Ms. Mullenschlader, she was that high school teacher [at North Division High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin].
Speaker 2: What was her name?
Speaker 1: Mullenschlader.
Speaker 2: Mullenschlader?
Speaker 1: Right, M-U-L-L-E-N-S-C-H-L-A-D-E-R, Mullenschlader that's how you.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's how you.
Speaker 2: German, obviously (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh yes she--I was interested in or, orations and stuff and they had a forensic contest--or you entered you could enter--and I was thinking about doing, going, doing the Elks' thing [Elks Oratorical Contest] so that I could win this scholarship.  I was in the either tenth or eleventh grade, I think it was the eleventh grade 'cause we were--no, I had came back to--I didn't win the, the first time the Elks scholarship, I won the second time.  So I think I was maybe in--I can't remember whether--when I really won I was in my senior year or whether it was my junior year.  I just can't remember I'd have to check the school records and I don't know if they'd have me, but it was either, I was either in the--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --the eleventh grade or, or the tenth grade and I decided that I wanted to enter the forensic contest because I was going to enter it.  I didn't tell my parents [Thelma Payne Rodgers and Russell Rodgers] that or the reason, I didn't tell 'em that I wanted to win the Elks Oratorical--well, I did ultimately.  I didn't do anything without my parents' knowledge or permission because that was the way we did in those days.  If mother said this, this is what we did.  If you don't chew gum, and she had rules as I said, for everything.  How a young lady entered a car, how a young lady exited from the car.  You, you--how a lady crossed her legs, how she sat, how she stood.  You didn't stand with your legs apart like a--you were gonna catch a basketball or something you know?  Everything was--she had like rules that no one, you know no one ever heard of.  So anyway, I decided to enter the first, the North Division forensic contest.  This is my first experience with the press and with any kind of--oh, well when I was very young and played on Prairie House [ph.], I was Little Miss Muffet in a little play that got in the newspaper, and I was Little Miss Muffet and I did my little thing, Little Miss Muffet who had a puppet or something and my picture was, but that was, I didn't count that.  Now, we're in high school and I went to, you were handed, you--there were four categories: extemporaneous was one which I wasn't interested in; oratorical; serious declaration; and humorous declaration, those were the four categories.  So I decided I wanted to do--I didn't want to do the serious declaration, I didn't want to do the humorous.  I would do the oratorical and, and I certainly didn't want to do a extemporaneous.  So I, they were prepared speeches, so you go in this movie theater, I handed them out, so I said I would like to enter the oratorical one, division and could I have one of the you know scripts, very civil.  And she said, "They're all gone, they're all out."  So I would--this would be after school.  You could go in, tell you the time, I would go, the time you were supposed to go to do it, everything was sort of regimented and I kept doing it over and over for maybe a couple of weeks until it finally got to me that she wasn't going to--didn't--there would never be--well they're all out and this or that and she'd have some reason for, for not giving me one, and she then--when I got it is when she said, "Why don't you take the humorous declarations, there's some of those humorous ones because that's what your people are good at.  There's Stepin Fetchit," and she named some (laughter), and she named some people like that, some of the clowns you know (laughter) and she said, "Take some of them."  Well I said, "I don't think I could do that, I'm not humorous you know."
Story_ID: 372990
Speaker 1: So then--I hadn't told my mother [Thelma Payne Rodgers] or father [Russell Rodgers] anything about it.  I was just--when I just told me the (unclear) they call her Tiny [ph.], but Thelma Schaffer [ph.] who is a Jewish girl was my dear friend and I loved him because first of all her name was Thelma and my mother's name was Thelma although they called her later, later on I, I called her Tiny and so we'd walk home from school because they were all Jewish, mostly Jewish people in the school [North Division High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], just maybe a dozen blacks in the whole school, and so Thelma would always be whatever I--she was always on my side you know as girlfriends would be.  "Well she is, that's so mean of her," whatever I wanted to hear, Thelma would help me talk about it, and so Thelma said, "Well why don't you talk to Ms. Roberts [ph.]?"  I don't think even Thelma remembers that she said that.  Well Ms. Roberts was an English teacher that was very sweet and my sister did little, she, she said my teacher, I told my sister once, "Would you like to earn some extra money, just for?"  'Cause I think my sister wanted something that, not a bike, but something she wanted, and said--my sister said, "Yeah."  She said, "Well if you come to my house on Saturday you can help me with, do this or that," and she gave her some little, nothing hard and my mother was a little kind of leery 'cause she just said, "She just must want you to come over and help" you know but she was an elder lady, because she's giving you--that's all you do is dust, you know, or is that's you do and my mother and father sort of decided I think that she just liked Yvonne [Yvonne Rodgers Curry] and she wanted Yvonne to be--she just liked her and she, she'd give her--send her home with cookies and things like that you know, it was harmless.  So anyway Thelma said, "Why don't you talk to Ms. Roberts, you know.  She loves your sister and, and see if she can get you the thing" 'cause Ms. Roberts was an English teacher and I had gone to Ms. Roberts and said, "Can you teach me, can you help me do, be an orator and how should I stand and?" So she said, "Well come after class, Vel, Velvalea [HistoryMaker Vel Phillips] and I will show you what you should do, how you should stand and all like that," which she did do.  And she knew I was writing my own speech for the oratorical contest which was, the name of the speech was--said something in the [U.S.] Constitution, The Negro and the Constitution, 'cause it wasn't black, they weren't saying black people then, The Negro and the Constitution.  And, and she would let me practice with her, she was so lovely. But anyway Ms. Roberts--I thought Ms. Roberts would tell Ms. Mullenschlader, "Give Vel one of those speeches" you know, you're, you're, you're--that is not fair.  That's what I thought Ms. Roberts would do for me.  So I asked Ms. Roberts when she didn't suggest it, I said Ms. Roberts would please tell her that I want, I think she's purposely not giving me you know when I caught on, when she told me about Stepin Fetchit and everything.  I said and those comedy the comedy was the 'Our Gang' comedy (unclear) remember that was?
Speaker 2: Yeah and our, when Farina [Allen Hoskins] and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, Farina and all those.
Speaker 2: --Buckwheat and all that?
Speaker 1: Yeah Buckwheat [Billie Thomas] and all that and she said that your, "Your people are natural comedians, that's what you should take those, one of those."  So I told Ms. Roberts. Ms. Roberts said that was not very nice of her to say that.  That's what Ms. Roberts said, and she said--I said, well, "Will you ask her to give me one of the things that I want to enter this contest."  And Ms. Roberts thought about it a while and she said, "Vel, aren't you writing, Velvalea aren't you writing a speech for the Elks Oratorical [Elks Oratorical Contest] thing?"  And I said, "Yes," now I don't remember, it's been too long ago whether I had gone and lost, and this was now the second time or whether--I think it was the first time that I had not won anything.  And she said, "You're writing your own oration?"  She said, "Well then, I will tell her or you can tell her, we go and we both can tell her that you don't need--to put your name down, you will be interesting, entering and that you have your own declaration, your own speech.  You won't--it will be an original speech."  And I said--this I remember distinctly.  I said, "Oh, I couldn't do that because this is all Negroes, this is written, I'm writing this for the Elks Oratorical, it is all Negroes."  She said, "Yes, but it's a--I've read it" 'cause she, she approved it for me.  She said, "It would go for anyone, it will be very good.  That's, that would be a good thing to do Velvalea," and so she says, "I'll tell her that you're entering your own and I'll put your name down."  So I was very shy about it, so she did that.  Ms. Roberts did that put my name down and so when I went into see Ms. Mullenschlader I said I felt very uneasy about it.  I went in and said, "Did Ms. Roberts tell you that I was entering?"  "Yes, she did."  "And did she--," and she was smart, very short--, "that I would be entering?"  "Well I, I think I need a copy."  I said well I, "It's not finished I can't give you a copy."
Story_ID: 372991
Speaker 1: Okay now let's pick up this story.
Speaker 2: Okay now what did I say last?
Speaker 1: Now you had Ms. Mullenschlader.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Wanted to see a copy of your (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yes and I told her it wasn't really ready, you know so she couldn't see anything.  So now it, you had to, you had to make--there were four categories [in the Elks Oratorical Contest] and--now I named them.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: Extemporaneous, serious declaration, humorous declaration and oratorical, and in all--for the same--you had to, they had a lot of names in each category and to make the semifinal, you had to be one of four people.  They named--in each category there were four people so all together there would be four, eight, sixteen people who would be listed in--four people in each category that made the semifinals and then after that, I'll never forget this, you had two--and you, you came to the big assembly room and everybody got up and gave their thing and then the judges would, would eliminate and then they put on the bulletin board in, in this category are these four people. In that category, in oratorical in each category there would be four people.  Then you go back to the--in a couple of weeks or whatever, maybe a week in between or maybe the next day, I don't know.  In a week you go back and then these sixteen people would be in the big assembly and then they'd go, the first category, and second category and then there'd be two people in each category.  Now we had two, four, six, eight and when you got to that, if you got that far, the finals would be the whole general assembly with all that the students there.  This is just after school, the, the preliminaries but once you made the finals, the finals then it was, you gave your speech before the whole assembly.  So we get in, we come after school and Thelma [Thelma Schaffer (ph.)] would always wait and we'd, so we'd--she'd wait for me and I gave my, assuming that each speech was twelve minutes you know, or ten minutes or something whatever, and I gave my two or three minutes, maybe ten minutes would be more like it, ten 'cause you had at the very end, let me see, at the very end you'd have ten, twenty, thirty, forty and that would be about an assembly hour forty minutes.  So maybe each speech, if each speech at the end would be, if you gave your whole speech it would be ten minutes, they'd take two minutes for, for your--to decide if you would be in the end.  So I was, was only (unclear) I did not make the first four thing, and of course Thelma, of course she was my friend.  She thought I was wonderful.  Other students thought I was wonderful you know but I didn't you know, I went the next morning and looked.  They decided right away whenever it was posted on the bulletin board and I was, I was eliminated at the very beginning.  Ms. Mullenschlader was one of the judges and so she, I'm sure she thought that, well, Vel's [HistoryMaker Vel Phillips] eliminated, I, I--she won't give me her speech [The Negro and the Constitution] or do anything, and I don't want her to be in it and she's just a little nigger, you know.  And so I can take care of her on another level and so I was eliminated.  And when I went to school [North Division High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] that day and found out I was eliminated I was--I remember going in the bathroom to shed a few tears.  There was nobody, I waited and went in the door and shed a few tears and then I came out and I was all right and--
Story_ID: 372992
Speaker 1: That was early in the day. That's the first thing I looked at, say like this is eight o'clock, and then around eleven o'clock just before lunch hour my sister said, my sister who was in school with me, so I had to be, it had to be the eleventh grade because she was on twelfth grade, and so she said, "Vel [HistoryMaker Vel Phillips], honey what did you do?  What's going on?"  And I said, "What do you mean?"  And she said, "Well there's something going on in the school [North Division High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], and, and your name and no one's telling me but they keep saying your name," and I said, "I didn't know, I had no idea.  So the bell rang and we had to you know for us to go to our class, just before Jacquelyn Peoples [ph.] who was our--my sister's good friend and my friend too, came over and she said in a very mean way, "Velvalea what have you done now?"  Because I said, "What do you mean what have I--?" 'Cause I was a quiet person I hadn't done anything. She said, "Yes, you have done something bad." And I said, "What have, what have I done?"  She said, "Didn't you know about the petition?"  I said, "No, what petition?"  She said, "They're passing a petition around to all the students to sign and I think that that's terrible that you'd do a thing like that.  You know there're not many of us here, there are not many black people here."  So I said, "What did I do?" And then Yvonne said, "Oh, that's what it is.  This petition said that you were eliminated [from the Elks Oratorical Contest] when you were the best one you know and that it was wrong and stuff," and she said everybody's signing it, and I said, I said--got, got me very nervous and I started to cry 'cause I cry easily, and I said, "I didn't do anything bad or anything and I just, I just didn't give my talk and I was eliminated, it was fair and square I guess."  And so she said well, "I don't know the students really--they're not."  I said, "Nobody has told me, nobody has asked my permission.  They can't do that without my permission." So my sister said, "Well they're doing it.  Well, honey I'll see you at lunch," or you know, so we broke up.  So now we're in the sixth or seventh hour which is study period and I got a note from the person, the teacher was--the teacher in charge came over and gave me a note.  She said, "You are wanted in the principal's office," and my sister was in the same thing and I looked at her and I started crying, and she said, she got up and she knew she was breaking the rules 'cause she was not supposed to get up, and she said to the person, she said, "This is my sister and I, she's upset and I have to talk to her," and so the teacher said it was okay.  She said, "Well, what is it?"  And I said, "I got a note, I got to go to the principal's--."  Well, see now, people go to the principal's office they may go and hit the principal or (laughter) or they may go and say, "What you want?" Zoom, but see then to go to the principal's office was a big deal.  So she said, "You gotta go to the principal's office?  That's terrible."  She said, "What are you going to do?"  I said, "I guess I go to the principal's office."  So I march in the principal--she said, "Immediately."  'Cause the woman said that we couldn't talk anymore, the teacher in charge.  So then Yvonne [Yvonne Rodgers Curry] went back to her seat and I went to the principal's office.  When I got in the principal's--and he was a German, his name was Werner [Fred W. Werner], W-E-R-N-E-R, and he looked, he wore glasses and he looked like a--oh, he was, he didn't smile a lot you know and I didn't think he liked me at all you know, and I was just shaking in my boots, I remember my heart beating so fast.  There stood Ms. Mullenschlader and there stood Ms. Roberts [ph.], and Ms., Ms. Roberts gave a little kind of like a little smile, but not much you know she didn't give me too many signals, and so Mr. Werner said, "Sit down, Velvalea."  I said, "I prefer to stand," he says, "Well, I would prefer you to sit down," and he had a seat, and so I sat down of course.  He said, "I understand that you gave a speech about the Negro and the [U.S.] Constitution [The Negro and the Constitution], and the students seem to think it was a very good speech but you did not make the final."  And I said, "Well, I thought it was a good speech because--."  He said, "I also understand that you wrote it?"  I said, "Yes, I did, I did write it," and he said, "Well, I would like to hear that speech."
Story_ID: 372993
Speaker 1: I'll never forget this like a fool I stood up like this, "Do you want to hear it right now?" You know (laughter), and he [Fred W. Werner] said, "No, I do not want to hear it right now."  He said, "So sit right down," and he said, "but what I would like you to do, you know there are five people in every category [in the Elks Oratorical Contest]," I mean four people in every category, "but in this division I'd like to say we're gonna have five people instead of four, and then that would give me an opportunity to hear your speech [The Negro and the Constitution]."  And, I said, well I didn't understand that, I said, "Well how do you mean?"  He said--then he explained it again, a second time and maybe even a third time 'cause I didn't catch on.  I said, "Oh I don't think I could do that."  He said, "Why?"  I said, "Because if I didn't win, if I didn't do it, my mother [Thelma Payne Rodgers] and father [Russell Rodgers], I don't think would allow me to do that.  If I didn't win if it was, if it was fair and square then I should not be in it."  And so he said, "Well I'll tell you what, why don't you think about it and talk it over with your parents?  See if they think that you shouldn't do it, but this is my opportunity to hear it."  I said, "Maybe I could just say it to you alone?"  He said, "No I've thought about this and I've discussed it with Ms. Roberts [ph.] and Ms. Mullenschlader and they don't totally agree, but I've decided myself--."  I mean when he said that I should've known, but I didn't think at the time, that Ms. Mullenschlader was saying that not to do it and Ms. Roberts was saying to do it.  But I didn't go that far, I wasn't that sophisticated.  I just said, "I didn't think that my parents would like me to do it, take credit for something I didn't do, sort of." He said, "Well talk it over with them, and see what you think, and--see what they think," and I said, "Well okay."  So then when I came out Yvonne [Yvonne Rodgers Curry], who I thought was waiting for me to find out what happened, had gone on home you know and, and it was just natural she was with her boyfriend, and I mean her--you know, with somebody, and then--but them Ms.--Thelma [Thelma Schaffer (ph.)] was there, my, my friend, who we're still friends today.  And so I told her and we walked home, we talked about it.  I cried a little and she said, "I think you should do it Vel [HistoryMaker Vel Phillips]," 'cause she was instrumental, she knew all about the petition and everything.  So by the time I got home, my--Yvonne had gotten there before and it--had told my parents that I had been summoned to the office, but she didn't know what it was for, so then my mother's--I told my mother right away, and my mother hit the ceiling.  She was livid, and you know, "I'm going to the school [North Division High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] and I'm going to tell--."  Oh, she this and that, you know she was just livid.  My father, who was always the cool one, said--and, "No, you tell them you are not going to do it, you know," and my father said, "I think that you should do it.  I think and I--."  I said, "Please don't go to the school, I'll be embarrassed and everything."  So my father said, and, "I don't think you should go to the--up there, 'cause you'll lose your temper, let--she's got to learn how to handle things herself.  You go and you tell them that you will do, be the fifth one, if you want to be the fifth one.  Now if you don't want to be the fifth one, you want to be a loser and just give up, then do that, but if you want to stick with it, he's giving you the opportunity to do, to be a fifth one and he apparently thinks there must be some unfairness otherwise he wouldn't do that."  He just reasoned the whole thing out.
Story_ID: 372994
Speaker 1: So I said, "Well, okay."  So I went to the school [North Division High School, Milwaukee, Wisconsin], the principal's [Fred W. Werner] office and told him that I would be a fifth one.  Well, we--it had passed around the students and everything so now I got up and did my thing, and when the semifinals came out I made them.  You know there were two of us and the guy, oh, I, I saw his son about four or five years ago and he reminded me, his name was--god I knew it, 'cause he came, he got to be a lawyer and he had a kind of an English clip.  I don't know if had been to England.  He was very good, he was as, as Thelma [Thelma Schaffer (ph.)] said, "He was the prom king, he was the main person in the school."  He was the most, he was handsome, he was really good looking, he was such a gentlemen and he was smart, and to go against him was quite something, but the fact that I made the semifinals was a big victory for me.  So I didn't really care about, about the rest but it--they decided--they, when they had the, the finals and it was before the whole thing somehow the Journal Sentinel got a hold of--the Journal [Milwaukee Journal; Milwaukee Journal Sentinel] got it and there was a little story in the Journal that said, that there was this little--that the students had, had a petition.  They thought that Velvalea Rodgers [HistoryMaker Vel Phillips] was really the best one and because of the confusion and the conflict instead of having the teachers be the judges, for the first time ever they were going to get the--some speech person from the university, from Marquette University [Milwaukee, Wisconsin] to judge the contest [Elks Oratorical Contest], and that was a big deal you know, so students felt like they had really won.  So now we get up to give our speech and I of course had been leery about it because I going to talk about the Negro and the [U.S.] Constitution [The Negro and the Constitution], and this French, this--the title of my speech was they, and I had it for a long time and I kept it, They Shall Not Pass, and then I said, "This were the words of a French general [General Robert Georges Nivelle] who was talking about his troops, but this is the way it is with Negroes, they are not allowed to do this and they're not allowed to do that."  It was a whole theme about discrimination and all that kind of thing, but the thing that was, that threw me, I almost couldn't, couldn't speak when I was--when it was my turn is that Irvin- his name was Ellis Irving [ph.].  When he got up he did a beautiful job but when I got up to talk because the students had passed this petition and stuff, they kind of thought that I was their person, they started whistling and standing on the desks and got very disorderly, "Yeah, Vel," and all like that you know, and I had never had, and of course the principal, was very upset and he got up and said, "Please, we will have order, right now, or otherwise this whole thing is--you know," he was in charge, and then they quieted down, but it was in that time that they quieted down that he said that.  My heart was beating very fast and I--because if I had to talk right then I wouldn't of known what to say, I was so startled that they were saying, "Yeah," they were standing on the desks and everything.  So then after everyone quieted down I started out with, "They shall not pass," and I did my whole thing, and of course I won, I won and (laughter) and I said to, I said later on to, to the guy I said, "You know it really wasn't fair because the students were so much for me because of--."  And you know what he said, he said, "No, Vel, you were good, you were very good."

I was not--how do I put it, I was--oh, and the, the pers- the thing is they, they, it was insulting to them because they had never had a woman even make the primary and I, when, when--interesting, this is stuff they all, all found late, they--once you make the primary then that was like in February and then the final comes in April and they--soon as you make the primary they, they start meeting and there were six- seventeen members of the, of the council and the interesting thing was (background noise) they would meet and get together, the--decide who was gonna be the chief one and all like that, and they would--I wasn't invited to that and there was seventeen aldermen and they had a tie, they--there were eight for Schreiber [Martin E. Schreiber] and eight for the other person, and eight made sixteen and they were tied but nobody had told me that--invited me to those meetings, and it wasn't until it was all over that I found out that I--they knew I would break the tie, whichever--whoever won, it had--to me, because eight people for Jendusa [Robert J. Jendusa, Sr.], and eight were for Schreiber, but they didn't tell me that.  They finally--Schreiber, Schreiber invited me--oh, the other thing I was gonna say, the fact that I was a graduate from the law school and the first black woman to graduate, that I didn't know where they were you know deciding who was going--I didn't know any of that 'cause they didn't invite me to the--to their little getting together, you know.  I didn't know that I would break the tie, that whoever I voted for would be the president of the council because there were eight for Jendusa I think, and eight for Schreiber and that was really kind of sneaky of them to do that. And--
Speaker 1: Well they tried to shut you out completely, right--(simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, they, they did shut me out.
Story_ID: 671838
Speaker 1: And the thing was that not only had a woman not even made the primary [for the Common Council of Milwaukee], but I (unclear) think--I told this to Ti- Ti- where is Tiff [Tiffany Koehler]?  Where is--right here--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: She's over there--yeah.
Speaker 1: They, they resented the fact that I wasn't a de- that there was not only a college graduate, but a lawyer.  I didn't know they were having their meetings and stuff and I wasn't invited, and my mother [Thelma Payne Rodgers] said, "Not to worry, honey," because only--I can't remember whether it was four or five, I can remember Jendusa [Robert J. Jendusa, Sr.], not Jendusa, Marty Schreiber [Martin E. Schreiber] and three others and they invited me to their little--no it was tied and they were meeting and everything, which reminds me, they had--oh, (unclear) my, my memory is, is kind of shady, but the thing, the fact that I was a lawyer was also a strike against me and not only did--had--no woman had even sur- made the primary and each of them when you--after you passed the primary, then there are two, there are two people, everybody has two people, and I didn't know that.
Story_ID: 671839
Speaker 1: But I was gonna say that after I met with Schreiber [Martin E. Schreiber], he invited for dinner, but they didn't tell me that I would--that there was a tie and that I would break the tie.  They never said that to me, but he invited me to dinner and they said, "Mrs. Phillips [HistoryMaker Vel Phillips], if we win, I will put you on the finance committee [Common Council of Milwaukee Finance and Personnel Committee]," that was, that, the finance committee was really very important but they didn't tell me that whoever I voted for would win, because I would break the tie.  It was very interesting, but the fact that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: So did you vote for him?
Speaker 1: I did, I did because he--at the very end we were just about ready to go to the final, they--he invited me and said that if he won he would put me on the finance committee; and the finance committee is the most important committee, and he didn't tell me, though, that I would break the tie.  I didn't find that until way down the line.  It was--but there're only either four or five, I know it was four but I, I keep thinking it might have been the fifth one that would speak to me and that was very helpful to, to me 'cause if I said good morning, they would just look at me like I was crazy; and the whole four years before we--they didn't speak to me for the whole four years.  And I remember this, oh, when we were, when we were at the primary before they and before they (unclear), they--oh, here's where I was--I forgot, they--after the (unclear) when you had to--from February to April when the finals came and do you know that--first of all, not only had--the first woman and the only woman, and first black and the only black, during the finals between February when you and the final in April--wait a minute because I forget--oh, I, everybody except me had only one person to beat because everybody at the--before, after the primary then every alderman had two people; and then at the final, whoever won the one person (unclear)--everyone had two people but I had four people, four because I had the one person that was on the ballot and then two other people were write ins.  I think I told you that, and so I had, they, they all had one person to beat, but I had three and one of the write ins got more votes than the--LeRoy [LeRoy J. Simmons] who was the, who was the, the two of us were in--
Speaker 2: On the ballot, yeah.
Story_ID: 671840
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about the open housing ordinance [Phillips Housing Ordinance]?  Now, you drafted that before.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And it sat there a long time before it became law, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I wish--this is the fiftieth year, you know that?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Did you know that?
Speaker 1: I know now (laughter).
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  And they're going to celebrate and that some white people think that Father Jim Groppi [James Groppi], who was--I like, he calls, called me and said, "Vel [HistoryMaker Vel Phillips], could we have lunch and stuff," and I said, "Yes," and he wanted to help me because the, I didn't--for the first four years I had, I didn't do anything spectacular.  I'd always been, did--I was on the finance committee [Common Council of Milwaukee Finance and Personnel Committee] and it was very wonderful because a lot of other people were, helped me but they didn't, they didn't--but everybody else after the primary had one person; I had three, two write- two write ins and then the person who was on the ballot every--all the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Now let's get back to Father Groppi, maybe bef- you had lunch with Father Groppi and you got involved in the open housing campaign, right?  And you wrote--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah well that was and in the--after my first term [on the Common Council of Milwaukee].  I didn't do much, oh I did a lot really because all the black people in, wherever they lived, thought I was their alderman and all the women wherever they lived, thought I was for them. So it was a busy--very busy four years.
Story_ID: 671841
Speaker 1: Even after you drafted the ordinance [Phillips Housing Ordinance], you marched with Father Groppi [James Groppi], right--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, I did, Gro- Father Groppi asked if he could join my cause and I said, "Yes."  Now, Lloyd Barbee [Lloyd A. Barbee] who was in the, he was an al- not, he was a--oh, what--he was I think in the legislature and he was very mad with me.  I, I, I didn't--he didn't hurt my feelings 'cause I felt that he had to do what he had to do, and I had to do what I had to do, but he was--I liked him a lot.  Now, Lloyd Barbee was very wonderful and, and but Lloyd Barbee was kind of mad with me, not, not hurtful mad, but just--he said, "Vel [HistoryMaker Vel Phillips], why did you let Lloyd--he, Lloyd--," I mean, Father Groppi asked me, he said, "Vel could we have lunch," time and stuff like that and I said when we talked, he said, "I want to join your cause," and Lloyd Barbee didn't like that at all.  He said, "Vel, he's just for himself," and I said, "Well, listen I'm not gonna worry about that or, I just think that you ought to be able, but--people ought to be able to do what they, they should be respected and all."  So that was--but I liked Lloyd, I liked Father Groppi, but.
Speaker 1: But Lloyd didn't trust Father Groppi?
Speaker 2: Right, he didn't, he said, "He just wants to be in--," you know, but when people in the newspapers come 'cause we, we marched for several weeks and when they would come, they would, they the news people would ignore me 'cause I was the one that brought it under the council [Common Council of Milwaukee], and go to Lloyd like it--and then Lloyd would say, "Listen, we're here to help, to help Vel, and she's the one who is running for the council," but--
Speaker 1: So, they would go to him because he's a man?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was a man and he was, he was Caucasian, and he was a priest, well they, they, they had about four or five--and here is something you should know, they're going to have a big blowout this, 'cause this is the fiftieth year.  Now they're in the fiftieth year anniversary and there's some people that think that Lloyd, that Barbee should be the big deal.  But Barbee came to me and asked if he could join my cause and I, I wasn't thinking about who's gonna get this credit at that, and that didn't mean really a damn thing to me, and I said, "Yes," but Lloyd told, told my husband [Dale Phillips] and told me, "Vel should not have met Bar- Father Groppi get--do things, anything at all," and I felt that if we could get a, a--some legislation, that was more important; and I, I was happy to let--I liked Lloyd a lot and, and I wasn't thinking about who should and who should not get the c- the, the, the credit.
Story_ID: 671842
Speaker 1: Now, in, in 1968 the fair housing act [Phillips Housing Ordinance] that you wrote finally passed, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, that is true.
Speaker 1: Now, was, yeah, that was on April the 11th--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And that's like two weeks after Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated?
Speaker 2: Yes, but--oh, yes, and I went to the funeral, yeah; and I was very close to not only Martin Luther King, but also the black who was on the--what's his name, it's--I know it isn't Wallace (unclear) name, who he was put on the support, on the--he was made--what's his name?
Speaker 1: Thurgood Marshall?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Thurgood, um-hm, they would call--when I think about the fact that Lloyd would call and, and Thurgood Marshall and I just took advantage, I just--I mean you know we were all in, in there for the cause and I, I loved the, the, the talks I had with, with both Martin Luther King and Thurgood Marshall.  It was wonderful to, to have--they'd call the house and we'd talk and stuff.  And can you imagine, yesterday I was, I watched the TV and they say that a movie called, I think was 'Moon-' 'Moon-'?
Speaker 1: 'Moonlight'?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: 'Moonlight'?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'Moonlight,' they say it's very good and, and, and all that, but you know I think it was three years ago when it all came out that no blacks were in the commercials, or anything like that and now here 'Moonlight' is.
Speaker 1: Oh, you're talking about the Oscars [Academy Awards].
Speaker 2: Huh--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: A couple--last year there were no blacks nominated for the Oscars and, and--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: That's right, and, and the thing that makes me really--is way back then, Thurgood Marshall and NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], the NAACP isn't quite what it used to be, but Thurgood Marshall was and, and, in--oh, what's his name?  Thurgood Marshall and--
Speaker 1: Dr. King?
Speaker 2: --Martin Luther King were talking about the fact that no blacks were in the commercials.  When I decided, before I decided just to do nothing, I talked to the Journal [Milwaukee Journal Sentinel] and they said to me, just, just like I'm talking to you, "We cannot have any black people in the commercials," and the commercials make real good money, and I said that I would be interested in, in doing like the oh, "Vel [HistoryMaker Vel Phillips], tells this," Vel, because my, (cough) my name coincided with Vel and tell and they said, "Mrs. Phillips, no blacks or people of color," some of them said, "will ever be in like, in the commercials," and they made as I said, good money, but they said no, and I was the first black to be on in the, in the judiciary and the first black--no, to this day, right now, as we sit, there's no black ever won a state race except me.
Speaker 1: So, you were state's attorney, you know?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, I was--
Speaker 1: Secretary of s- yeah--(simultaneous)--

Speaker 1: Secretary of state, right.
Speaker 2: And oh, yes, and the only black one sec- state (unclear).
Story_ID: 671843
Speaker 1: Let me ask you the question like this: what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: That's a hard question because I, everything I did, I did for, because I wanted to--I didn't care, money or anything.  Let me see, I guess--I was telling Tiff [Tiffany Koehler], I think when things are really hard, and 'cause I get a lot of terrible mail, mail--people would come, they shot through my backdoor and my mother [Thelma Payne Rodgers] had to take the children, my--they were then very young, and I had to shield them because I would--got many, I didn't save any of them.  The police got some of it, 'cause I threw a lot of stuff away.  But it was, it was really tough those days, it was really, truly tough, but I didn't think about it.  I didn't even, I remember when Thurgood [Thurgood Marshall] would call, "Let me see your (unclear), Vel [HistoryMaker Vel Phillips]," and I'd say, "Well don't you wanna see me?" Laughingly of course, and he said, "Well we love you Velvalea." My husband [Dale Phillips] was head of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  Oh, it was, it was really wonderf- in those days.

Speaker 1: Well, tell us about Dale Phillips, now, he was your husband and he was a lawyer too, you both came out of the University of Wisconsin--
Speaker 2: Right, he--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --law school [University of Wisconsin Law School, Madison, Wisconsin].  And--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: He's, he--fifty [1950]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --and you both worked on--he was more behind the scenes and you were out front, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, he, he, he was wonderful really.  We, I, I just--I miss him so, really, truly.  'Cause it was--we were married at--almost nine years before I had my first child [Dale Phillips, Jr.] and then, but Dale graduated, as I said in 1950 and I graduated in '51 [1951], and I knew there were any, very few I think maybe only three or two or three black women lawyers way back then.  He was very exciting and very, he was just--I had no idea that I was doing anything that was, that was outstanding.  I just did it out of love and the satisfaction it gave me because I was able to do--.  I remember this white girl that came to work in the, in the place where the aldermen did their thing and there was a black girl had, had, girl had graduated from--I can't remember where they--one of the black schools and she had graduated and she's just very, very smart.  She asked for--tried to get into be one of the people that would you know do things for the, the aldermen, and they turned her down; and then about--they had this young white girl and we were--she was dictating and I saw in the window, a sign that was about like that wide (gesture) and that big thing, we are--and the sign said, "We are"--I can't remember, but it was saying that they, we, we hire black peoples and all like that and there was this young black girl who had graduated from one of the black schools.  I can't remember all, but they, they didn't hire her.  So, they hired a white girl who hadn't even gone to college; and when we were sitting and I was dictating to her, I saw this sign, it was--you know it was like (gesture) big, saying "We are a--"
Speaker 1: Equal opportunity employer--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm, so I said to her, this girl, I said, "Would you hand," she was close to it, I said, "would you hand that to me, please?"  And she said, "Oh, you want it?"  I said, "Yes, just hand it to me."  And she gave it to me and I just tore it (gesture) that way two or three times, and she was shocked.  She said, "Why did you do that?"  I said, "Because it's a lie," I said, "you're here and you never even went to college," and the young lady that was so bright and she--I can't think of the--it was a black college in Ohio and--
Speaker 1: So Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio], or?
Speaker 2: Wilberforce--I said, "She was very good and she didn't get hired, you did and you'd never gone to college or anything," and she was just shocked.  Do you know she quit about two days after that because she was, felt that it was dangerous, of course I wasn't going to do anything to her but I, when I took it from her, she said, "Why did you do that," and I said, (unclear) I said, "Because it's not only a lie, it's a damn lie, and it's--they didn't hire any--," I said, "the young lady that was here had gone to, had graduated from Wilberforce and she didn't get hired; you did."

Speaker 1: Tell me, what do you think about the state of Milwaukee [Wisconsin] today?
Speaker 2: Oh--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I mean what's going on in the City of Milwaukee?
Speaker 2: First of all they gerrymandered, it's in the courts right now.  You ought to check it, you'll find out what's going on because they gerrymandered; and that's how we got Scott Walker and the black person that who you know his--I can't think of his name now because of my strokes, but his wife is a very good friend.  They, they gerrymandered and that's how Scott got to be the one--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: The governor of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Wisconsin, right--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm and so there, they're fight--the judges said that Milwaukee was a gerry--had been (unclear), then they won that Scott and all the people because they did a lot of gerrymandering, so that's what's going on now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he wrote, he said when the courts decided fight it to speak out about it--and I know, what's the--are you familiar with the black man who was--I know his name as well as I know my name.  I cannot--he was with a very prest- very, very prestige--do you (unclear) ask, Tiff [Tiffany Koehler]?
Speaker 1: (TIFFANY KOEHLER):  Hm?
Speaker 2: John, John, he's, he's a black lawyer that was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: John Daniels [John W. Daniels, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: John Daniels, right.  John Daniels was with a very prestigious law, law (unclear) and they recently just about--was in the paper about three, a couple--two or three months ago that the judges--I was surprised they've done it because it, every, it was, it was very obvious that Scott had a lot of people and they're fighting it but it's now, it has been p- still open, (unclear) put it in the paper and everything, but the way, the reason Scott Walker ran, so and won is because they were tremendously, Scott (unclear), I mean gerrymandered.

I did what I did because I really believe it, and I had a wonderful mother [Thelma Payne Rodgers] and father [Russell Rodgers] who were very kind and wonderful to me, but--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Now, yeah, we talked about them last time, can you tell us something about your children, and a- 'cause I know it's to be involved in all the activities you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --with children, right?
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, my one son [Dale Phillips, Jr.], older son had some, he--mental issue- issues and he, he did graduate from that eastern con- school in New York.  I cannot think of the name, but it's, it's one of the high, very good, both of 'em.  Michael [Michael Phillips] gradu- went to that school in, in California and he quit that.
Speaker 2: He's a lawyer now, right?
Speaker 1: Yes, he's a lawyer, and when he got with, both of 'em--what's its name that's very prestigious in New York?  Oh, I can't think of it--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York], or?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Columbia is one, but it's some, another one.  It's very--

Speaker 2: Cornell.
Speaker 1: Cornell, yeah, he graduated from there, but he had some mental issues.  I miss him so, he was such a wonderful car- son, and Michael too.  but only in the whole time that I was married to my son [sic.], there were only two, maybe three, I can't think of the third one--times when we really had caused, you know, had, that I did something wrong, because Michael was, if it hadn't been for Michael, I would not have been able to be a lawyer because he had the G.I., the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] and all the expenses, the lawyer books and all (background noise), he, he got free and I was able to, to take advantage of that.  But I did have a very good mother and a very good father.

Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I, I think I would have gone for the [U.S.] Congress, I, I but, my son--my husband [Dale Phillips], it was such a jolt when he was--had a heart attack, that I didn't want to do, go and I backed the one we have now.  Our, our black, black congresswoman, Gwen Moore.
Speaker 1: Right--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I, I not only gave her a thousand dollars when the money was not all that good for me, but I backed her.  If I had it to do again, I think I would've gone and--I know I would've won because people were very good to me.

Speaker 1: What advice would you give young black women today who want to go into politics?
Speaker 2: Oh, I--my mother said I had so many wonderful things and I think I told you before that I, I--and it's still true, I've have never had any alcoholic beverages at all, and I didn't, had never smoked ever; and the only man I've ever know was the one I married [Dale Phillips] and we ran off and had a, sneaked a pairage--marriage, and you know I came back home and then we had a wedding.  But I would say the people who did the, the documentary on me, I, I, it's, I didn't bring it with me where I said my mother had so many things she, she says, and one of the things was, "Do your thing," but the thing that I didn't really think about until after the people at the doc- documentary made their theme and that was, they said, oh, "Dream big dreams."  My mother used to say that, "Dream big--don't fool around with the little, honey," and because I went to college, my sister [Yvonne Rodgers Curry] was two years older and she didn't want to go to college, she just wanted to marry; and I came home at Christmastime and my mother had said, I had said to my mother that I wanted to go to a black college and she said, "Oh, no you don't, it's way--we can't afford it," and all like that.  We really could have afforded it.  That's what I told her, I said, "Well suppose I get a scholarship?"  And that's when she said, "Oh, you, if you get a scholarship you can go wherever you want."  Well, I got the scholarship, she said, "No, if you--you don't need to do that," and that's when my father [Russell Rodgers] said, they were talking and my sister and I always eavesdropped on--he, he said, "Well, Thelma [Thelma Payne Rodgers], you've promised her she could go; if she got a scholarship you'd let her go," and that's when my mother said to me, "Well your father thinks I should let you go," and that's when she laid down the (unclear), 'cause my father said, "Just make up some rules, (unclear) whatever you make up, make it whatever you want," and that's when she said, "I'll think about it, I'm not s- gonna promise, but your father thinks I should make up some--," "Do that," and that's when after a couple of days she said, "I'll let you go if you--I have three things that you have to follow," and I said, "Yes, anything."  And one was no smoking, the other was no alcohol of any kind, and the third was if you wed a young man and he starts going east, riding east toward the lake, you sit right up 'cause he's up to no good.  But the thing is that's why today still, I've never had any alcohol at all.  I do not sm- smoke; and the only man I've ever known was the one I married.
Story_ID: 671849
Speaker 1: Can I ask you this, this last question, today anyway: how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, I think my mother [Thelma Payne Rodgers] had so many things that she said and as I told you before she, she said don't fool ar- first of all she made me promise to not drink until after I graduated from college.  Of course I never had and she said no smoking.
Speaker 1: Yes, but how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As my mother used to say, "You can do what really you want if you stuck with it," and she would say, "big, big dreams, don't fool around with little stuff." She was very, very black even though she was light skinned, but she didn't like and, and did everything to, to let her friends know the man who--what's his, what's the football (unclear), the people that are, that are--their--where they practice and everything, the, they--she would say, "Big, big dreams, don't fool--big dreams, don't fool around with the little, silly stuff."  Just--what's the name of the, it's--he was the black--he was white and he started bringing the black people, he's the public football hero.  Not, he, not, he's white.
Speaker 1: Oh you're talking about Vince Lombardi, or?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  Sh- my mother had about five, she bought about five papers, cut 'em up and she would say even people would say things that she showed (unclear) Vince Lombardi said, "As long as I am the head man," that Vince Lom- "there will be no niggers.  No niggers at all wear a uniform," that says that Vince Lombar- the football star; and my mother would, they would just be so worn out, she had thrown one one day, she had another one because she would, he would, he was very racist.  But if I had it to--I said to Michael [Phillips' son, Michael Phillips], "Michael," and to Dale [Phillips' son, Dale Phillips, Jr.], oh, I just had so many--he's, he graduated from his eastern school.  If I had it to go again, I think I would have run for the--I, I, I supported our black person in the [U.S.] Congress and I think I would have done that.
Speaker 1: You would have run again, yeah, you would've run yourself?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: You would've run yourself if you were--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --to do it again?
