 L. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  Today is February 28, 2011. My name is Latasha Wilson, and I   m with  the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at the OSU Library. I am  in Southwestern Oklahoma today at the home of Erby Hunter. I will be  interviewing Erby as part of the Spotlighting Oklahoma Oral History  Series.  His wife, Mary, is joining us, and so is Randy Wilson.  Thank  you for having me here.  You   re welcome.  Let   s start out by having you tell me about where you were born and  about your time growing up.  I was born in Olustee, near the doctor, but I   ve been here all my life in  this house.  How far is Olustee from this house?  About twelve miles.  So, how did your family get there?  They went in a car. They had cars. It was 1929.  And then they brought you home to this house that you live in today?  Yes, yes.  How many siblings did you have?  I had a brother about five years younger that was born, and he died at  birth.  5  L.

Wilson  E. Hunter  So, that was your only sibling?  Yes.  What did your parents do for a living?  Farm. My dad was a farmer. My mother was a school teacher, but when  she got married she quit teaching school.  What did your dad farm?  Well, cotton mostly, in those days, and wheat.  How many acres did he have at that time, out here?  He had 160 acres.  And how did he come to settle on this land?  His dad did. I don   t know.  Do you know where his dad came from?  Illinois.  What year did he get to Oklahoma?  I don   t know, really. He was in the run in northern Oklahoma  somewhere in    89, I think, Charlie was. I   ve heard that, my Dad told me.  What were some of your chores growing up?  Oh, I plowed, fed the horses, and worked horses in those days. And I   d  bring in coal for the stove when I was a kid.  What does working horses entail?  Well, you just hooked them to your cultivator or your lister and  harnessed them. That was a lot of work. My dad mostly worked mules.  He had mules.  Did he have any other hired hands helping or was it just   ?  Yes, he had hired hands a lot of times. Then, when I got old enough, he  got a tractor, and I helped then too, in those days.  6  L.

Hunter  Did your family have a big garden?  Yes, we had a garden. It wasn   t too big, I don   t think.  Do you remember your mother canning?  Yes, and I had a milk cow. We always had a milk cow, or maybe more.  You had your own milk and butter. And they   d butcher hogs. Probably  butcher a calf, you know, at the end of the ear.  Did you have a smokehouse on your property here?  Yes, had a place. You   d put the pork in a box. He   d mix his own  seasoning up, and he   d rub it into the bacon and the hams. Usually, the  shoulders, they   d grind it up in the sausage. They didn   t have pork chops  then. They had them, but they made tenderloin. That was the best part of  the hog, down the backbone. That   s what I thought, anyway.  So, what were some of your favorite foods that your mom would make?  Oh, I   d eat about anything. (Laughs) I was a good eater. (Laughter)  Was Ruby from around here?  Yes, she was up southwest of Altus.  And that   s your mom?  Yes.  Do you know how your parents met?  No, not really, but she was teaching school over at Harmony. She taught  three years, and when she got married she quit teaching school.  Didn   t your dad have a dance or something? He had a bunch of people  come.  Had a what?  A dance? He was an old bachelor?  Oh, I don   t know. I wasn   t there. (Laughter) Maybe that   s how it was,  Mary. I don   t know.  I think so.  7  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  R. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  Yes, he lived here, and he always had some people   he had a guy work  for him. They were usually black people. A black family lived here.  There was an old three room house here, and he built these first two  rooms, new. He lived in the old house. I can remember seeing them  move this on two wagons, these two rooms, fourteen by twenty-four,  and two teams of horses, and set it down here. I wasn   t very old. I don   t  know how old I was.  Where   d they move them from?  Right over here on this   he built it right north of this house, over there.  Wow.  Yes.  But your grandparents built the original house?  Yes, I   m sure, yes. Those houses were three rooms. It was usually two  rooms this way, and then they built a room in the middle, back it seemed  like. You see a lot of houses like that.  T-shaped?  Yes, T-shaped. That   s what they are.  So, was there a separate house on the property that the other family  would live in?  Yes, but then when he moved this he had already wrecked this other old  house that was here. So, this was the only house, then.  Did you have indoor plumbing?  No, not until 1950. We got electricity in 1938   REA  Rural Electric  Administration  came. We had our house wired before. We   d been to  Altus. We got home on Christmas Eve, and the lights were on in the  house. I guess I   d go around and turn the lights on and off all the time. I  don   t know. (Laughter) There was one plug in, in each room. In those  days, it was three dollars a month for forty kilowatts. You never did use  over that, but that   s what it started out running, three dollars a month.  How would you bathe?  In a tub. In a number three wash tub. (Laughter)  8  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  M. Hunter  E. Hunter  And you had an outhouse?  Oh, yes. Yes, we had an outhouse. Yes, 1950   now, the second build-on  was this room, right here. Then, the third time was in 1950, and he got  propane in 1950. We quit having to bring coal in to burn coal. Then in  1975, he built the two big rooms in the back, back there. So, it   s been  built onto three times.  Where would you get the coal?  It   d come from eastern Oklahoma. And I don   t know who sold coal  around, but they   d deliver it. People in Altus sold coal in those days, but  it came from eastern Oklahoma.  What about ice? Was there anyone that delivered ice?  Yes, there were people who delivered ice from Hess, and from the  country. Then later on, Benny Ward had an ice house in Hess. It was all  insulated where it   d keep everything  cool , and he would deliver ice.  But I think we might have had electricity by then.  What would your family use ice for, primarily?  Iced tea.  Did you ever make ice cream?  Oh, yes. Yes, yes, I liked that. (Laughter) We had homemade ice cream.  Did you all raise chickens?  Yes, chickens. We   d buy some baby chicks in the spring, and then have  chickens. We   d put them in freezers after we had freezers. But yes, just  go outside and kill them.  How would you kill them?  Ring their neck and then have a fresh chicken. (Laughter)  Would you dunk them in hot water right after you rang their neck, to  make it easy to pluck?  When they   d quit floppin    around.  Yes, yes. Some people skinned them, but most of them   I think my dad  9  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  R. Wilson  E. Hunter  R. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  used to skin those chickens. He   d get the skin off of them. They were  good when they   d come right out here. I mean, you ate them the same  day you killed them. (Laughs)  Did your mom do a lot of sewing?  Oh, yes. She sewed.  Did she make your clothes?  Yes.  And quilts?  Yes. Oh yes, quilts. They quilted. She was in the Farm Women   s Club,  up here at Hess. They   d quilt so much they   d have it out there. Do you  remember the club house, Randy?  Yes.  One time they went to the state fair in Texas from the county, a lot of the  farm women. She had her picture. All of them had pictures, those ladies.  I imagine it was thirty or forty that went to the state fair in Texas, which  was in Dallas, I guess, where it was. I think that   s where it was. But,  hey, I   ve already told you more than I thought I knew. (Laughter)  What about telephones? That   s what I want to know.  The telephone got here in 1974, I think. And we got on the waterline in  1958. No good drinking water here. We have two wells, but it   s not  good, so we got on this water. We hauled water forever, until we got on  that Jackson County waterline.  Where would you haul the water from?  Well, in the country around here about a mile north and a half west. It  was a good well over there. Briscoe   s well, Lonnie Briscoe. And then,  we built this big concrete deal out here and Lee Meeks hauled us water.  We   d get it hauled over, and I had a pump out here in the house, just  drinking water. We used the other water. It was all right to cook with  and wash dishes, and bathe. But now, we have softened water. Now, we  just use the county water altogether.  Would you ever have any home demonstration agents come out to your  house?  10  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  M. Hunter  R. Wilson  E. Hunter  M. Hunter  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  Yes, I think so, years ago.  Would they just talk to your mom?  Yes, I think so. Yes, I think there was an old lady up there.  How old were you when you started to school?  Five.  And where did you go to school?  Hess. Hess had a school a half mile south of town, straight west of here,  a mile across the field. I went there until the third grade, and then they  consolidated, and I went to Elmer two years in the club house. Then,  they built Southside. They were building the Southside school, and they  wrecked the Elmer school. They wrecked the Hess school, and I guess  they used some of the stuff, I don   t know. But I came back to Southside  in the sixth grade. I graduated in 1947.  What year did Southside start?  I think it was    41.  Randy, what year was the school burnt?     69.     69?  I remember some of the kids had come over when it was burning. I  accused them of setting it on fire.  I   m pretty sure it was   I think J.L. Tucker was in the first graduating  class. Tommy Tucker was in the last one. It was here fifty years. I  believe that   s right, something like that.  J.L. was telling us about helping come up with a school mascot. Do you  remember anything about that?  No, no. (Laughter) What, the red devil?  Yes.  It was a red devil, I knew that, but I didn   t     11  L. Wilson  M. Hunter  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  R. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  He said some of the women didn   t like it, but the boys didn   t care.  The preacher sure didn   t like it   Yes, that   s right. (Laughs) Yes, the Southside Red Devils.  What did you do after you graduated from Southside?  I went to farming. My mother wanted me to go to college, but I was tired  of school. I   ve been farming since then.  Do you remember any dust?  Yes, I do. I can remember when I was in school we had a dust. Those  days, kind of like yesterday, only more, because all this land here then  was in cotton or something. Now, we   ve got wheat, and it keeps it from  blowing. But yes, I remember that place up there blowing. We   d hang a  wet cloth over the windows there. Oh yes, I remember the old dust.  Did you have many neighbors?  A lot of neighbors in those days, yes.  Would you all get together very frequently and have a   ?  Well, yes, sometimes I think, but not really. We had neighbors. We had  the Wilsons, the Graves   oh, just a lot of people here. Now, we   re the  only there. We   re on this side of the blacktop. Well, and the Easley place  down there. Then J.L., Bob, and that boy who lives in the trailer house.  How far down the road are they?  Well, they   re about two miles, a mile and a half there. There are three  families. Then here, when Billie  Wilson  moved, these were the only  people left. The Easley   s were gone then, they moved.  There used to be somebody about every half mile.  Yes, a half mile on every quarter, and on a lot of eighties there was a  house, eighty acres, a lot of people.  Would you ride the school bus to school?  Yes. One time I had to walk a half mile to this corner, but next thing I  knew they were coming by. First, they came by, and then they got to  saying if you lived as close as a half mile, you had to walk, but then they  12  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  M. Hunter  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  M. Hunter  R. Wilson  E. Hunter  R. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  R. Wilson  E. Hunter  M. Hunter  changed that up. I don   t know.  Do you remember feeling that effects of the Depression?  Not a whole lot, because I always had plenty to eat. It was tough times,  but I didn   t realize it when I was young.  Everybody raised a big garden back then.  Pigs, and we had chickens, you know, and we   d have eggs. We always  had chickens.  Were there any WPA  Works Progress Administration  projects?  Yes, here   s a bridge right up here. There are still some old bridges  around here, built in 1936. You ought to go up here. This big bridge runs  straight north of here, a little over half a mile.  I bet Bill knocked that date off.  Is it concrete?  Yes, concrete and it   s got a stamp.  That one, down by our house.  Yes. But see, they filled that up with dirt. Yes, they were just like that.  It   s up here, and it has banisters. They filled yours up as high as the  banisters, I think.  County Commissioner  Joe Boyles did that. I can  remember that. I guess to try to hold the water, I don   t know. Water  gives a lot of trouble sometimes.  Did the government come out here and buy your cattle during the  thirties?  Yes, they were here. I don   t know whether Dad had any cattle or not, but  I know some people that did. They   d come out and kill them, throw  them, and bury them. Sometimes the poor people, they said they   d go  cut a hind quarter off or something.  Were they doing that to control prices?  Yes, they had too many, I guess.  I remember in Texas, they controlled disease that way, too.  13  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  R. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  M. Hunter  E. Hunter  R. Wilson  E. Hunter  R. Wilson  Yes, but in 1938, people plowed up their cotton, too. Too much cotton,  and it   s cheap, and they paid something on that. I don   t believe my dad  had any cattle killed. I don   t think so. He never did have, in those days,  over a milk cow or two.  What are some things you would do for entertainment?  Oh, I don   t know. (Laughs)  Chop cotton?  Chop cotton, yes. (Laughter) We had a croquet set here when I was  young. Have you ever played croquet?  I have.  Yes, we had one of those. We didn   t go to town a whole lot. We   d go to  Hess some. Hess had a lot of people in it, and there were two stores     two grocery stores, two stations, and maybe three, at one time.  Do you remember how high Hess   s population got?  Probably up to a hundred, maybe. I   ve been thinking there   s around  fifteen or eighteen  people  there now.  Did you ever have rabbit drives?  Yes, but I never could go. I was too young, I guess. But they   d go and  they   d carry sticks or something. They   d just take a net wire, and put it  around them. My dad would go. Boy, I wanted to go  He said,    No,  you   ll get hurt.    Probably would have. (Laughs) I   d have probably  been     Well they used to hit those rabbits behind the ears, too.  Yes, to help kill them. Some people got to where they wanted to shoot  them. That   s when I wouldn   t have wanted to be there. (Laughs) Yes,  they would just pin them up.  Did the Wares or anybody ever put on a music show in Hess?  Yes, yes. Old Pitt  Elton Ware  and those other guys did. You remember  that, don   t you?  I never did see them.  14  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  R. Wilson  E. Hunter  R. Wilson  E. Hunter  R. Wilson  E. Hunter  They had a singer and picked the guitar. Yes.  Would they have a gathering?  Yes, just people that came to listen, I guess.  So, was there a post office in Hess?  Oh, years and years ago, but there hasn   t been one in a long time. I can   t  remember a post office. It   s always been at Elmer. But years ago, they  had it. They had telephones years ago, they said, that ran on the fence, a  barbed wire fence. A bunch of people got together and built and put in a  line here, in the back, I guess fifty years ago. Then finally, the Santa  Rosa came over in    74.  Were you involved in WWII at all?  No, I was too young.  Were there many people from the area that were?  Yes, there were a lot of people. I saw today, a man that was the last alive  that was in WWI. He was 110, and he died.  Are there any lessons or values that you learned growing up that you   ve  carried with you?  Yes. Just try to save everything, I guess. (Laughs)  Don   t get in debt too much?  Yes, that   s right. The guy, our baccalaureate   this preacher was from  Tipton, and I can   t remember who he was. He said,    The three D   s: stay  out of dirt, debt, and the devil,    and I   ve remembered that ever since  then. (Laughs) I don   t know why. But he was from Tipton. I used to be  able to remember his name, but I can   t now.  It might have been Whittaker.  Well, I believe   I don   t know. Do you ever remember hearing him  preach, Whittaker?  I think I did.  He was pretty old, wasn   t he?  15  R. Wilson  E. Hunter  R. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  L. Wilson  E. Hunter  Yes.  You know, he married Aunt Lou Ellen then, the second time. She was  married to Wilson, I told you the other day.  Yes. Well, you all survived the Depression probably because you didn   t  own your land.  Yes, but it was pretty tough, all right.  Did you know many people that went to California?  No, I didn   t know any. I didn   t really, I don   t think. We didn   t go. We  probably didn   t have anything ready to go. My dad was too much of a  home guy. He wouldn   t want to go that way if you asked him, I imagine.  I guess I   m that way, too.  Are there any stories or anything that you   d like to share?  Well, I think I   ve shared about all I can remember  (Laughter)  Well, I really thank you for letting me interview you.  You   re welcome.  -------  -------
