Speaker 1: Before we go into depth, there are five People magazine-ish type, lightweight questions that we are compelled to ask you.  They only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And the first one is, ma'am what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Gee, I'm a foodie.  I love all food.  That's the hardest question anybody's ever asked me.  I like baby vegetables, fresh baby vegetables.

Speaker 1: All right, a favorite time of the year?

Speaker 2: Anywhere where it's quiet and beautiful and mellow.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: In my business it's, "it will reveal itself".
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Usually when someone doesn't know what I'm going to do or they're not sure how it's going to turn out it's basically, trust me, it will reveal itself.
Story_ID: 178247
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about your family history.  I'm going to ask you about your mother's side and your father's side of the family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But first I want you to give us your parents' full names, spell them for us and their dates and places of birth.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Madeline Wheeler Murphy, born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, October 24th, 1922.  And my father, [HM] William H. Murphy, Sr., born in Baltimore, Maryland, April 20th.  He was seven years older than my mother so that would make him I think 1917 [sic, 1915].
Story_ID: 178248
Speaker 1: Can you tell us what you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: I wish my son were here.  He's the genealogist.  But my mom [Madeline Wheeler Murphy] was born in Cambridge [Massachusetts] and she went to public schools there and then they moved to Wilmington, Delaware.  Her father was a gym teacher.  Her mother didn't finish college but finished two years of school.  Her father graduated from Springfield College in [Springfield] Massachusetts and became a gym teacher.  He was an excellent swimmer, an excellent teacher.  He taught at Howard High School in Wilmington, Delaware.  They had three children, my mother being the middle daughter, an older daughter Marianne, and a younger brother, Arthur E. Willard, Jr.  And they lived in an Italian-Black neighborhood in Wilmington, Delaware.  And my grandmother was a real pioneer.  She was, she became a makeup artist and she became a sales person in a small neighborhood-owned, dry goods store in Wilmington, Delaware.  She was really someone I absolutely adored.  And on my father's side--?
Speaker 1: Well on your mother's side--
Speaker 2: Mother's side.
Speaker 1: --just to go back a little further--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --how far back can you trace that side of the family?  Are there any stories from the nineteenth century or you know--?
Speaker 2: Unfortunately I'm not the historian but they--we are descendants of the Livingston Family [Robert R. Livingston].  My mother's--let's see, my grandmother's grandmother had a relationship with one of the Livingstons in Jamaica and then they moved to the states in--and she worked and lived in upstate New York.  We actually went to the reunion of the Livingstons several years ago after my son had done research on it and--
Speaker 1: Now what is the--how are the Livingstons significant or, I mean the--?
Speaker 2: The signer of the Declaration of Independence.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then the Boston Family there are, on the Wheeler side my grandfather's side are ministers, abolitionists, part of that whole movement in New England.  And then there was another grandfather who was a teacher unit--not a teacher, a minister, Unitarian Minister.  And on the Wheeler side was a painter, a remarkable woman Laura Wheeler Waring.  She was the sister of my grandfather, my maternal grandfather and she was born in Connecticut and taught in Pennsylvania at Cheyney State College [later, Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, Cheyney, Pennsylvania].  She was a portrait painter, an illustrator and a teacher and she's a real role model for me in terms of having had a successful career as an artist but not having gotten the recognition that she deserves for it.  On my grandmother's side Madeline Hall was her maiden name and her father was a gardener and they had two daughters--or one daughter, Evangeline Hall who was a teacher at Cheyney State University and was an English teacher.  So there are very strong women in my family background on both sides.
Story_ID: 178249
Speaker 1: Okay, now on your father [HM William H. Murphy, Sr.]'s side?
Speaker 2: On my father's side, my father is the youngest of seven children to Grace Hughes Murphy and George Murphy, George Benjamin Murphy.  His father was a high school principal in Baltimore [Maryland].  And my grandmother, Grace was a daughter of Hughes Catering Company, which was a very successful catering company in Baltimore that served the so-called landed gentry of Maryland and she managed the business.  And one of her jobs was to teach white people how to use knives, forks and spoons.  These were many upwardly mobile whites in Maryland and she--
Speaker 1: The nouveau riche.
Speaker 2: The nouveau riche.  And my father talks about her having a room where she would bring these people in and teach them how to use utensils and how to recognize courses and so she was quite a character.  She was diminutive woman and very much a business woman.  On my father's side, George Murphy was, as I said was a high school principal and his, all of his brothers worked at the Afro-American Newspaper [Baltimore Afro-American], Carl Murphy being his eldest brother and John Murphy being the grandfather who founded the newspaper.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And the newspaper was founded from a--and John was an itinerant, he moved in, moved up from the South and he didn't know how to read and write but he did learn how to read and write and got money to buy the newspaper from his wife's family, the Howards.  And these were all country farm people but they had money and they lent money to John to buy the Afro and it's been around now for 102 years.
Speaker 1: Right.  From what I understand he was a Civil War veteran.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  You probably know more about him than I do.
Speaker 1: And was he a white washer, is that what he was at the (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  So you know, there are probably some jokes somebody can make about a white washer buying a newspaper but--
Speaker 2: That's right (laughter), that's right.
Speaker 1: But I don't--
Speaker 2: But they were courageous people and you know, to create a voice for African Americans.  And the interesting thing about the newspaper was that the paper would be read because of the train route.  The Pullman Porters would bring the newspaper and take it down the South and so the newspaper was read all up and down the East Coast.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was one of the most important black newspapers in the country you know, in those days and today.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yes, the Afro-American.  Okay.  And your grandfather was the principal, George--
Speaker 2: George Murphy was a principal.
Speaker 1: --Murphy was principal of which high school was it?
Speaker 2: I don't recall.  I don't recall but he was a beloved principal, an excellent teacher of teachers and very firm, strong teacher.  But when he came home, Grace Murphy was the tough one, his wife (laughter), a very independent woman and had independent resources because her father left all of the sisters a wonderful inheritance.  And so every year Grandma Murphy would go to Bermuda for a good part of the winter, late or early spring.  And she would just--and she had seven children and George be, George would be, now Grace who's going to look after the children while we have--we have Cleo and we have--they had a house man and a maid and so she just, she would take her sister sometimes and, or her daughters and go to Bermuda and then she'd go to Atlantic City [New Jersey] in the summertime so she was quite something (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 178250
Speaker 1: Well tell us about your mother [Madeline Wheeler Murphy], what was she like and--?
Speaker 2: Well my mother is a brilliant woman in my opinion.  Very artistic, very well read and spent the early part of her marriage raising a large family.  There are five of us.  And then about the time I became a teenager, she had decided that it was time for her to pursue something else.  She, in her early years she was the secretary to Redding [Louis L. Redding], the attorney, I can't think of his first name in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] who was responsible for Brown v. the Board of Education [1954].  And then when she married, she had her children very young and I was her second daughter and we were very close.  It was like we were just buddies.  And as she got older and the feminist movement came about, she decided that she wanted to get more involved and she became involved in the Presbyterian Church.  She and my father [HM William H. Murphy, Sr.] were one of the founders of the Cherry Hill Presbyterian Church in Baltimore [Maryland] and she worked in the Education Department, Community Education.  She taught Sunday school.  They were involved in the PTA [Parent Teacher Association].  They were very, very much involved in the community.  They were activists and really looked to and looked up to.  She worked in a poverty program in Baltimore and then she became--she was a writer for the Afro American Newspaper.  She wrote a column for twenty five years and her columns were something else.  I mean she was fearless.  She talked about the mayor, she talked about politics.  She talked about anything that troubled her.  She was well read and she was up on current events.
Speaker 1: Was there a title to her column?
Speaker 2: 'Madeline Murphy Speaks.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she did.  And then she became quite a television personality.  There was a program called 'Square Off' where she was a regular.  And as recent as a couple of months ago, I ran into a young woman who was looking at my mother and saying oh is--she said, how is Madeline Murphy?  And I'm sitting there Madeline Murphy is sitting right next to me.  We're named--we have the same name.  I said this is Madeline Murphy.  She said she looks so good.  I can't believe it.  She said when I was fourteen years old, I used to run in the house and turn on 'Square Off' and listen to her because I'd never seen a black woman with that much courage and spunk on television.  And she was fearless.  She would tear people up and I think that's where my sister Laura [HM Laura Murphy] gets a lot of her fire, you know.
Story_ID: 178251
Speaker 1: Can you remember any of the issues that she [her mother, Madeline Wheeler Murphy] squared off against in those days (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well she was talking about the prison systems, voter registration.  She would talk about black politicians who weren't doing their job.  She would call them out you know if they didn't take stands on things.  She talked about the movement.  She talked about the leadership in the movement.  She talked about things like off-site dumping, building garbage dispose--units in our neighborhood, you know.  She would go--she would sit in the mayor's office.  I mean she was a coalition builder.  She galvanized people around causes, just amazing, just amazing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the other side of her was that she was an extraordinary cook, a great gardener, a wonderful knitter.  She'd knit beautiful, beautiful clothes and she had this tremendous versatility to what she was able to do.
Speaker 1: Did she ever think about running for public office?
Speaker 2: She ran for public office on numerous occasions unsuccessfully.  Between my father [HM William H. Murphy, Sr.] and mother there must have been about thirteen elections.  And we lived in a neighborhood called Cherry Hill [Baltimore, Maryland], which was a low income community where many veterans had moved to after the war and lived in public housing because in those days when the--when you came back from the war the white soldiers got money for mortgages.  Black people couldn't get mortgages.  So there's a whole generation of people who never had homes because they were denied the opportunity to get money to buy homes unlike their white counterparts.  And many moved into public housing as a segue into finishing school and going to--he went to law school.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And then we bought a house in the same neighborhood.
Speaker 1: In those days public housing didn't have the stigma it has now.
Speaker 2: Not at all.
Speaker 1: And it was a different kind of a--
Speaker 2: It's a very different life, a very different life.
Story_ID: 178252
Speaker 1: We lived in a single family you know it's like row houses.  It was beautiful.  It was a wonderful--there was a community center.  It was a very different life, a very different life.  And we never left the community and my parents [HM William H. Murphy and Madeline Wheeler Murphy] had very, very deep roots there in terms of voter registration, building the church, working with the PTA [Parent Teacher Association], mentoring kids and just a--made tremendous contributions to the community.  And my father started his practice in the home and then moved downtown and opened an office, a law office downtown.
Story_ID: 178253
Speaker 1: Okay, well tell us about your father [HM William H. Murphy, Sr.]--
Speaker 2: My father died this spring and it was pretty remarkable to hear the stories about him that I didn't know.  And he was a fighter and he was a perfectionist and a very demanding person.  And he suffered from racism as all men in his generation did and still do and as a result he was always about making a difference and changing things and taking risks.  He too was fearless and one of the things that we all remember the most was that around the dinner table there were quizzes.  We had to read the newspaper, we had to be prepared to talk about current events and most of all we had to have an opinion.  Don't sit there and have my father ask you something, you say I don't know.  He says what do you mean you don't know?  You have to have an opinion.  Say something even if it's wrong.  Make a decision.  So he was, he was like a tyrant you know, and some of us were terrified although I wasn't.  But he was harder on the boys cause he felt he knew that black men had to be better, they had to be superior.  One of his favorite expressions and he said this to us all the time, he said you must always remember this, you're equal to mo--equal to all, and superior to most white people.  And he told us this over and over again because he always wanted us to know that we had a strong background, that we came from something, that we were bright and that we could compete with the best.  And so he was very hard on us, very hard on us.
Speaker 1: That's interesting that he would you know, make you give an opinion you know.
Speaker 2: Oh god, oh man!  Even till this day, you know it's like, you know I hear that voice, make a decision, even if it's the wrong one but make a decision.  He didn't like wishy-washiness.  That was not tolerated among any of us.
Speaker 1: Who were his political heroes?
Speaker 2: You know he never said because he was so busy making a difference himself, you know.  He never talked about that.  I mean I think he was a strong family man and he respected his parents.  I think he had the greatest admiration for his mother because he loved the fact that she was a business person and--
Speaker 1: With the Hughes' catering business?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  And he used to work in the Hughes' catering business and he was a waiter and he--and then when he and my mother [Madeline Wheeler Murphy] first started out he used to go to auctions and he bought furniture at auction.  He bought canned goods at auction and they'd resell it.  I mean he was an entrepreneur to his bones.  I mean--and that's where I think I take a lot after him in that regard.  But his, he--I--he didn't have time for heroes.  He was out there changing the world, representing poor people.  And one of the challenges he had, he used to tell this--he told a story about how he was appointed a case, given a case and he went in to see this black man who was locked up.  And so daddy walked in and the black man looked at him and he said oh my god, they sent me a nigga.  And daddy looked at him and he said, and this nigga is going to make you walk.  And so he was constantly having to deal with the fact that black people didn't always go to other blacks and that they didn't respect or didn't know that black people were as good or better or could represent them in a higher court.  My father went all the way to the Supreme Court representing his brother George B. Murphy who was called up before the House of Un-American Activities [sic, House Un-American Activities Committee, HUAC] and he defended his brother.  So my father had a certain fearlessness about him and he had an enormously loyal following of clients who he defended and who--he talked about a woman who came in who was a domestic and my father was very courtly and when a woman came in the room he got up, pulled the chair out, seated her, shook her hand and sat down and talked to her.  And he said this one particular woman looked at him and wept because she said no black man has ever stood up for me.  And so his business was a--became a very strong referral business, people and women loved him.  He was, he was just a lovely man.  And I think--but the price of what he did, the activities that he was engaged in, the hard work that he was constantly doing was that it made it hard for him with his children because he became so demanding.  And you know, he worked so hard and he knew it wasn't easy and he didn't want us to take anything for granted so he was a very demanding father as was our mother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 178254
Speaker 1: Tell me about growing up in Baltimore [Maryland].  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well we had this sort of schizophrenic life that we lived.  We were the family that lived on the hill.  Our father [HM William H. Murphy, Sr.] was the lawyer.  Our mother [Madeline Wheeler Murrphy] was the activist and the community organizer and so we were part and were not part in some ways.  We were very involved in the Presbyterian Church.  We went to church every Sunday.  My mother sang in the choir.  My father was a deacon and so we had a very strong church life.  We went to the public schools there.  I went to the public schools up until sixth grade and then it was at the time when--and we had very, very good public schools, excellent teachers, well-educated teachers.  And there came a time when integration was taking place and there was the opportunity for me to leave Cherry Hill [Baltimore, Maryland] and go outside of the community.  And--but I'll go back in terms of living this sort of schizophrenic life.  My father was very, very hostile towards the traditional black bourgeoisie because he didn't think they gave anything back.  He didn't think they were political.  He was very hostile and as a result we never belonged to any Jack and Jill or any social groups.  They didn't have a coterie of friends that they played cards with or played--it was very little play about either my mother or father.  They were always about cause.  They were very cause driven.  And so our life was very prescribed.  It was very, very much about the five of us at, in that family, you know.  So we did--we had relatives that we visited but we didn't have a lot of kids of you know, of the same sort of economic background that we came from so we were very isolated.  And then when we left the community to go to integrated schools, we had to spend so much time because we lived way south and the better schools were way northeast.  And when I went to high school I'd have to get up at six and be on the bus by seven, travel for two hours and then get back home you know.  So we had a very sort of interesting, different kind of life experience.  No debutant balls, none of that.
Speaker 1: None of that kind of stuff?
Speaker 2: None of it.  None of it.  When someone requested to you know, invited us for me to be presented, my mother looked at me and said, well is that something you want to do?  I said why would I want to do something like that?  And of course I had been conditioned against that kind of thing.  And so she said you know the money that we would spend on a dress in a cotillion, I'm going to take you on a cruise.  So my mother and I went on a Caribbean cruise.  So we always sort of want--went against the stream, always.
Speaker 1: That's interesting cause I think most people would assume that you would have been a part of all of that, you know--
Speaker 2: None, not in the least.
Speaker 1: --coming from a family that's associated with Afro American and, you know--
Speaker 2: Um-um.
Speaker 1: --a successful business.
Speaker 2: We were the rebels. We were the rebels.  No, we didn't part--I didn't know how to dance.  I mean I didn't, I mean I was like a misfit.  I was really a misfit in high school.
Story_ID: 178255
Speaker 1: So you're saying the family is really a political family--
Speaker 2: Oh god!
Speaker 1: --you know, extremely political and--?
Speaker 2: And you know it was such that actually the politics, the activity in politics began shortly after I left.  I got married in '66 [1966] and so it was really ratcheting up.  So I wasn't there during the entire period of the running for political office and all of that kind of thing but the ground work was being laid.  The activism you know, the voter registration, the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], all of those you know, oh yeah.  And I mean I sat in, in the mayor's office.  I don't remember what we were doing but it was to protest some kind of sentencing and you know I went door to door registering people to vote so voting was very, very much a big part of what I was involved in.  And I also had a newspaper route.  I had--well I took it over after my brother went to camp one year.  He had an Afro American Newspaper, what else?  And Billy was a charmer and Billy would serve these newspapers and he would leave them and people wouldn't pay and he would just--but he just loved his route.  It was a social activity for him.  But when I took it over it was a business activity.  So I'd go and I'd knock on the door, Afro and they'd stick their hand out for the paper.  I said, collect.  And they said well Billy always left the Afro.  I'm--you know, we'll pay.  But I said no pay, no Afro.  And so by the time Billy came back I had weeded out all the dead beats.  It was fully paid.  He took it over and there it went, you know.  But--and I think that's what my father saw in me that I had business acumen.
Speaker 1: How old were you when you took over his paper route for a while?
Speaker 2: Oh I must have been about fourteen--thirteen--fourteen.
Story_ID: 178256
Speaker 1: When you were a little kid, what kind of a little kid were you?  What were you interested in?  Now you had business acumen.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What else?
Speaker 2: I was in Junior Achievement, you know but I was a tomboy and I used to climb and run around the neighborhood, and I was also a nurturer.  As the family increased, I became the second mother because it was about that time I guess when my brother was born, Arthur who was born in 1950, I was born in '45 [1945], I sort of just--my mother [Madeline Wheeler Murphy] allowed me I think and was relieved that I liked taking care of the kids and so I did.  So as a result I'm really close to them and--I was a baby sitter.  I didn't date.  I stayed home, I baby sat, I sewed, I drew, I made paper dolls and my mother and I would have tea parties.  And one thing I remember my mother started painting.  She had taken up the hobby of painting and I was eleven and so she would--after dinner was over, she would set up her studio in the dining room.  She had a little easel and a little table.  And that particular night she's going to the PTA and she just, my mother had this way of looking at us with those steely gray eyes and she said, don't go near those paints and she said it to all of us, all four of us.  And for some reason, I who was the most obedient child, I mean I was such a good kid, I was drawn to those paints and I went in and I painted a still life and I set it on--I was terrified after I'd done it cause, you know I disobeyed her.  And I sat it up on the easel and went to bed that night.  When I came home, when she came--saw me the next morning she was so excited and so proud.  She said, "You're an artist.  You are an artist."  And I have that painting.  So I did that, I took care of my siblings.  I was a girl scout.  I was a swimmer.  We had a public pool that was about eight, ten blocks and every day in the summer we would walk all the way to the pool.  By the end of the summer I looked like a Hershey bar, because I was in that water swimming and I became a life guard and I swam competitively when I was in college briefly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So I was physical.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, okay.
Story_ID: 178257
Speaker 1: Alright now what grade school did you attend?
Speaker 2: Cherry Hill Elementary School, No. 151-159 [Baltimore, Maryland].  And then, and I went to junior high school at Robert E. Lee Junior High School, No. 49 [Baltimore, Maryland].  Then I went to Eastern High School [Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 1: Now what--did--had the neighborhood for Robert E. Lee changed, you know?
Speaker 2: Well Robert E. Lee was actually downtown.  There wasn't--it didn't have a community around it.  And it had started--it was a very special school.  It was a, an accelerated middle school so you did three years in two.  And it was for gifted children and so I passed the test and I got into this--my brother had preceded me.  And I could--and in those days we had half years so I started mid-year so I was like--so I actually skipped a year and a half by the time--that's how I'd finished high school at sixteen.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what high school was it again?
Speaker 2: Eastern High School.
Speaker 1: Eastern?
Speaker 2: An all-girls' high school.  And my class was the first class that integrated.  The first full class, you know starting from freshman year.  Up until that time it just had been integrated a couple of years before.  I hated that place.  It was very clannish with you know, white girls and they were very, not very friendly.  There were very few black students.  We were clannish.  And I traveled so far to get there every day that there wasn't much time for socializing even though there was a boys' school right across--City College [Baltimore City College, Baltimore, Maryland] was the boys' school.  And we would see the boys you know on the bus stop and then we'd--there was a corner, the corner of North Avenue and 28th Street or something--and St. Paul, North Avenue and St. Paul, it was called "the corner".  And that's where all the buses intersected and all the black kids were coming there to transfer and I remember I used to be so excited to be on the corner cause the boys were there but I was this really funny looking little kid.  I wore orthopedic shoes.  I had braces and eye glasses and my mother [Madeline Wheeler Murphy] made my clothes so I don't think you could have any worse combination (laughter). Oh God.  You know my mother used to make all of my clothes.  And her--she was very good at it and she made beautiful things but I hated every one of them.  And at night she would sew well into the night and then hanging on the dining room door would be a dress.  And it was a beautiful dress but it didn't look like anybody else's clothes and I hated those clothes, god, how I hated those clothes.
Story_ID: 178258
Speaker 1: Now this is, yeah, it is kind of unusual that your mother [Madeline Wheeler Murphy] would sew you know, your clothes and that sort of thing, you know.  You typically would think that the wife of a lawyer and stuff--
Speaker 2: Are you kidding?  My father [HM William H. Murphy, Sr.] was the tightest man known to man. I mean my mother made clothes, she canned, she cooked, she gardened.  We shopped at Sears and Montgomery Wards.  We never bought anything full price.  My father would go to auctions.  I mean he was--and even when he could afford it he didn't want to spend money.  So I always wanted to be able to go to the store and just buy something, you know and that didn't happen for a while.
Speaker 1: So did she make your clothes all through high school?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  She made my, yeah.  She made my formals.  She made my wedding dress.  She--yeah.  I mean we did begin to buy more--
Speaker 1: All through high school and beyond then right (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well after high school I started buying things in high school because by that time--
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: --her life had changed and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --daddy had more money and I was working.  I worked at the Afro [Baltimore Afro American] after school and so I had some money.  But then when I was in high school--when I was in college I was in Art School so I didn't have any clothes.  All I wore was jeans and you know awful clothes, ugly shoes and all that kind of thing.  So I had no interest in fashion but that did change in my adult years (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.

Speaker 1: High school [Eastern High School, Baltimore, Maryland], so there was not much social life in high school--
Speaker 2: Um-um.
Speaker 1: --at all?  I mean so you did pretty good academically I would suppose--
Speaker 2: I did fairly well.
Speaker 1: --because you were really good in grade school?
Speaker 2: I was a good student, but I wasn't a driven student.  And I remember my father [HM William H. Murphy, Sr.] didn't have the same expectations for me as he did for my brother and so you know, if I made a C, he said well a lady-like C is okay but for my brother, why did you get an A minus, you know.  So there was this real difference in his expectations and I always resented that about him cause I always felt if he had just pushed, you know a little more and had different expectations.  But my mother [Madeline Wheeler Murphy] was not that way.  She was much more--had great expectations for her daughters and sons.  So in high school I majored--I was in the accelerated program there, the A course.  I did okay but I didn't like school because I think it was a combination of things.  Not liking the environment, I just hated, hated that place, hated--the teachers were prejudiced.  I traveled half the day getting there so I must have been tired you know.  And so when I was ready to graduate, I didn't know what I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: Now were there any teachers in your life, I mean from grade school on that served as like mentors or any special teachers?
Speaker 2: No.  I can't--in high--in college--in--at the Maryland Institute [College of Art, Baltimore, Maryland] maybe.
Speaker 1: Okay, we'll get to that then.
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: But up to this point--
Speaker 2: But I mean I had fine teachers in elementary school [Cherry Hill Elementary School, Baltimore, Maryland].  In elementary school I had good teachers, Mr. Brown you know, in sixth grade. And I had good teachers but I don't--there, there's nobody that really stood out in my recollection--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --cause you know we got so much support and so much stimulation at home you know educationally in terms of the demands you know.  Lord knows I didn't need another teacher kicking me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Nobody could be as tough as your parents I guess.
Speaker 2: Nobody.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My brothers and sister and I said if you could survive growing up in that household, you can survive anything.
Story_ID: 178260
Speaker 1: It was tough.
Speaker 2: What was the daily routine around--did you get up at a certain--how (unclear)?
Speaker 1: We got up--my mother [Madeline Wheeler Murphy] did--was not a morning person cause she was at night sewing and doing all of that.  And so my father [HM William H. Murphy, Sr.] was the one that was up in the morning and he was like a clock and he a routine.  He would, and he would cook our breakfast and we had to be down there, ready to go you know.  I mean he--it was--it--he had no tolerance for lateness.  And I'll never forget it, when I learned how to drive I used to have the privilege of taking the car but I would have to drive him to the office and pick him up.  And so man, don't let me forget something and have to run back into the house and get you know, I forgot something.  Oh wait a minute--I got--I forgot--"got dammit."  He was very profane so he was, he was tough.  He was tough but that's not to say that we didn't have fun.  We played Scrabble.  We had wonderful Christmas parties you know, with families coming, you know relatives coming and decorating the tree, making ornaments and we always took summer trips.  We drove--we took car trips across the country.  Every summer my father took a vacation and took all of us so it wasn't, you know it wasn't like a terrible place to grow up but there were, we had limits and it was a routine, you know.  It was discipline.
Story_ID: 178261
Speaker 1: So, as a senior in high school you really weren't sure what you wanted to do, right?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you know, I had this wonderful counselor, Ms. Burrows [ph.], never forget the woman.  She said you know, "I think you should consider going to junior college.  I don't think you should try to get into college.  I don't think you're college material."  So she really discouraged me from having a good sense of my ability sort of reaching, to reach for something.  I came home and told my parents.  Well, you know they just went berserk.  Don't you listen to her!  That's not the case.  You can apply to any college in the country.  Get the application.  And my mother took me to Sarah Lawrence [College, Bronxville, New York].  She knew--she always knew I was an artist and she took me up there and we interviewed.  I would not fill in the application.  They--she stood on her head.  I mean she wanted me to go there so badly and I dragged, I procrastinated.  I wouldn't fill in college applications, I just was not motivated.  And so my father [HM William H. Murphy, Sr.] said, okay you're going to business school and you're going to the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland] and that's where I went.
Story_ID: 178262
Speaker 1: Now this is nineteen sixty--
Speaker 2: One [1961].
Speaker 1: --One, okay.
Speaker 2: And the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland] had been recently integrated.  It was an enormous campus.  It--I lived in the dormitory for two years and absolutely hated it.  I hated it.  The classes were huge.  I didn't do well and my mother could see how miserable I was and she said you need to go to art school. You're an artist.  And so I applied to the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore [Maryland], got admitted and it changed my life.  I was in my element, you know and I was a person that danced to a different drummer.  And being stuck to books and that kind of thing, I needed to be in the studio, I needed to be painting and drawing and I just, I blossomed and I did very, very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I graduated from there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--
Speaker 2: No sororities.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No sock hops, all work.  I commuted every day, back and forth.  Then I worked at the Afro [Baltimore Afro-American] in the afternoons.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were there any teachers there that--?
Speaker 2: Yeah I had a teacher, Raoul Middleman and Joe Sangiamo [sic, Albert Sangiamo], my drawing teacher, my painting teacher who encouraged me.  I had a great time there, great time.
Speaker 1: So how long you were there--?
Speaker 2: Three years.
Speaker 1: Three years?
Speaker 2: It took me three years, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you graduated with--
Speaker 2: B.F.A.
Speaker 1: B--okay.
Speaker 2: In painting.
Speaker 1: Bachelor of Fine Arts.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: All okay.  This is 1964 now I guess, right?
Speaker 2: No, it's sixty--
Speaker 1: Was it '65 [1965]?
Speaker 2: Let's see, I got married in '66 [1966].  It was '66 [1966] by then so '61 [1961], five years, '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 178263
Speaker 1: Alright, now how did you meet your husband (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well there's another piece of this story.  While I was in, at the Maryland Institute [College of Art, Baltimore, Maryland], I was introduced to this young man who was a medical student at Hopkins [Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland] and he pursued me very, very aggressively.  And I hadn't dated a lot of people and I thought you know that this was the one and so I became engaged to marry him and I began to discover things about him as it got closer to the wedding.  And the day before the wedding--well my mother [Madeline Wheeler Murphy] made the dress.  I had bridesmaids.  I had--this was gonna be a big wedding, big wedding in Baltimore.  And I changed my mind the day before the wedding.  And uh--
Speaker 1: That's kind of tough to do to change your mind--
Speaker 2: I was nineteen.
Speaker 1: --the day before the wedding.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was nineteen.
Speaker 1: And all that pressure and everything.
Speaker 2: Lot of pressure and--
Speaker 1: Well what was it?
Speaker 2: --I realized that he was not a well person.  There were things about him that I was beginning to see.  He hated my mother, he hated my background.  He was a--he had--he was not a wealthy young man.  He'd worked his way up and struggled to be the first medical student to be accepted at Johns Hopkins.  And he sort of had a love hate thing for my background and my family and I just saw a side of him that really frightened me.  And I said I'm not doing it.  I am not doing it.  And so I told my parents and my mother was like, are you crazy?  What is the matter with you?  Are you sure?  I said, I'm not going to marry him.  And they insisted that we go together and talk to the minister and I had--I was adamant that I wasn't going to do it.  And my father [HM William H. Murphy, Sr.] who was the tightest man in the world and who'd spent a small fortune on this wedding said, if that's the way you feel, fine.  And we donated all the food to one of the girls' reform schools and the flowers we sent elsewhere.  And by this time the entire family had come for the wedding and so they spent the day of the wedding wrapping pack--wrapping gifts and sending them away, eating the food and my grandmother was upset.  "Well you could marry him and then you could get a divorce later," you know.  And it's like, it was so awful.
Speaker 1: I think they wanted to see the event, huh?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  People were very disappointed.
Story_ID: 178264
Speaker 1: I was in high--I was in college at that point.  That was in June and there was a very, very dear family friend, E. Valeria Murphy, not a relative but a very close family friend who lived here in Chicago.  And she was not going to come to the wedding and it was odd that she wasn't coming to the wedding.  And I found out later she didn't like him and she thought it was the wrong thing for me to do.  And she was going to a Presbyterian conference in Taos, New Mexico.  And so when I called to tell her she said, get on a plane and come to Chicago [Illinois] and go to Taos with me.  You need to get away.  And I did because it was insane.  You know my mother [Madeline Wheeler Murphy] was angry and it was disrupt--I mean the phone calls are coming in.  What happened and I mean--and of course the Afro-American Newspaper had me on their front page--Bride Says No.  Oh god (laughter).  So I left and I went to New Mexico at a Presbyterian conference grounds and I was there for about three weeks and it was just great.  And then she invited me to come back and work in Chicago.  So I worked at Sixth Grace Presbyterian Church that summer in the day camp teaching arts and crafts and I lived with my cousin, Grace Bruce, my father's niece.  And so halfway through the summer my cousin says, "You know I want to introduce you to somebody."  I said, "Grace, do you know what I've just gone through?  I have no interest in meeting anybody.  Just leave me the hell alone."  "Oh no, no, no, no, no."  And she and her girlfriend, June Bailey, "We got a guy that you just have to meet."  And so June says, "Look the worst that could happen you get contact lenses."  He was an ophthalmologist.  I was wearing these big eye glasses.  So they--we procrastinated and finally I consented to meeting him and so he came to Gracie's apartment one Saturday night and he was like dressed in a suit and tie and was impeccably dressed and here I am an art student, no clothes, nothing you know I mean looking like an art student, you know.  And he fell in love with me he said.  He [HM Dr. Maurice F. Rabb] came in saying that he look--he always--he said I have to be somewhere at you know 10 o'clock and, well 1:00 a.m., he's still there.  And so that began a courtship that, that endured for about two years with my not being interested in him and his pursuing me and finally ending with my proposing to him.
Speaker 2: You proposed to him?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Because I just, you know, I would dis--I mean I went back to art school and he would come and visit me and then one time he came and I wasn't there.  I'd gone to New York to get away from him.  He came to New York to find me.  I mean it's like it's a great love story.  It was a great love story.  I don't know how great it was for him but he was determined.  But there came a point where he got weary of me because I would just you know, I went to Lake Tahoe one summer and worked and I told my mother not to tell him where I was and he found me.  I mean it's like, he was relentless but finally I realized that this was a very special man.  And it had come to the point where he had had it.  It was either this way--we'd literally come to a fork in the road.  If said, if I go this way it's over and if I go this way we're going to continue.  And I had to make a decision at that moment so obviously I took the road.  And so we continued to date and I was in my last year of college and like in February or March, I called him up because he had actually trekked through the snow to visit me in one of the worst blizzards in Baltimore.  I mean this man was like so wonderful.  And I said you know I love this man.  If he, if he gets out of my life you know--so I called him, I said, Maurice, let's get married. And the phone went dead.  I said Maurice, are you there?  Yes.  He said are you serious?  I said yeah.  Let's get married over spring break.  He said, well you're graduating in June.  Why don't we just wait until June?  I said oh, okay.  So we had a very tiny wedding and I married him three days after I graduated from the Maryland Institute [College of Art, Baltimore, Maryland] and moved to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Okay. Well that's an interesting story.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So my sister says every now and then I've said something like, oh I can't do that it's too late.  I can't say no now.  She said, don't you ever tell me it's too late (laughter).
Story_ID: 178265
Speaker 1: Alright so well, what happened in Chicago [Illinois]?  What did you do here?
Speaker 2: I came here with a--my B.F.A. and we moved into the 601 building.  He had started, already started his practice and he had opened--he was actually the first African American to open an office in downtown, a medical office in Downtown Chicago.  So he had an office downtown and he was spending a lot of time in those days trying to get on hospital staffs and in those years it was very, very hard for black doctors to get on staffs.  So he ultimately got on Reese and Mercy, etc.  So a lot of that--I was orienting myself to being there and one day I woke up and I said, I don't like just being home.  I want to find a job.  So I had seen this magazine supplement in the Sun Times called Tuesday Magazine.  And I looked at the masthead--
Speaker 1: Right.  That's an African American--
Speaker 2: It was the first African American magazine insert that was focused on African American values.  It was a weekly or a monthly supplement.
Speaker 1: Yeah it was similar--
Speaker 2: Leonard Evans founded it.
Speaker 1: --and it would be like um, an African American Parade Magazine or something (unclear) so to speak.
Speaker 2: So I saw this publication and I said oh, this is fabulous.  And I went down the masthead, got the telephone number and called them up.  And so I called them up, I said, I--my name is Madeline, Madeline Rabb and I'm looking for a job and you really need to hire me cause I said, I worked for a newspaper before and I know about publishing.  And so they said, oh really?  We just happen to have a vacancy.  Why don't you come down?  So I went down and I interviewed and they hired me on the spot.  So I did a variety of things there and one of them was Vice Pres-- Assistant to the Vice President of Production.  So I was responsible for looking at the magazine and making sure all the color was right and the copy was accurate and the art work got where it was supposed to be.  And then I'd go down to Louisville, Kentucky to the printer and oversee the printing of the magazine and I loved it.  I just loved it.  And so I did that for a couple of years and then I got pregnant and then also Maurice got the opportunity to get a fellowship in San Francisco [California] to study cornea.  And so in those days you know why wouldn't I quit my job and go with my husband, you know?  And in those days you know, you just did those things.  I wasn't like, oh I'm--you're interrupting my career in advertising.  And so we sublet our apartment and lived in San Francisco for six months and then when I came back I was pretty pregnant.  I worked a couple of months and then I had had our first son, Maurice.  And after that, I became--I spent time as a mother and an artist, you know going to the Hyde Park Art Center, taking classes and painting.  And it was really frustrating to be a mother, an artist and to be married to a physician and to be perceived as a dilettante and not a serious artist.  And it was during the height of the civil rights movement you know, when AfriCOBRA [African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists] and a lot of the art movement in Chicago was very angry, very political, and rightly so but I didn't fit.  You know, I was too bourgeois.
Story_ID: 178266
Speaker 1: Now you said the, the political arts movement or what we call the black cultural arts movement is going on--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --basically.  And when you were painting and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and while I was political and aware of what was going on, that was not what my life was.  I was a middle class woman, married to a physician, not struggling, and my subject matter had to do with things that were familiar to me.  I did drawings and a lot of it was sort of social commentary on my middle class environment.  I did these drawings about parties that I would go to and I was like an observer sort of observing people and I drew figures and I drew flowers, I did still lifes.  And it wasn't the kind of thing that was radical or--but it was authentic and I didn't fit.  I really didn't fit and so I was not taken seriously or given the respect.
Speaker 1: Now, are you saying in Chicago [Illinois] in those days if I can understand what's going on here, I know that now a lot of the art that was--the public art especially, the murals and stuff that AfriCOBRA [African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists] was engaged in, Mitchell Canton and [HM] Jeff Donaldson and Calvin Hill and lot of them you know, have been seen in retrospect as being great but during those days here they really making money as artists or gaining notoriety as artists?
Speaker 2: Well, the movement in retrospect yes, became very powerful but the Wall of Respect and all of the mural--that mural movement got a lot of recognition and a lot of respect in those days.  But as far as my life was concerned, I think more than not, not being a part of it, I think my needing or wanting to be part of something I think--when you come out of art school, you have a community of artists around whom you work and so there's this sort of give and take.  And when I left art school, I didn't have anyone to really talk to.  I didn't fit with the feminists, the white feminist women because my issues were not the same issues as the white feminists, you know and so I didn't fit there.  I didn't fit with Afrocentric artists and I had, I struggled but that's not to say I didn't continue to make art.  And I got a studio in 1978 on South Michigan Avenue, and I had a studio for twenty years and made art and--but I did find how to get my art out there.  So I exhibited--I did--I exhibited at the South Side Community Art Center.  That was a very, very welcoming place, very supportive.  I served on their board.  I worked with the DuSable Museum [of African American History, Chicago, Illinois] and helped raise money for them so I was involved in arts circles but there was always this sort of--and maybe it was I who felt it, but I always sort of felt not taken seriously.  Not you know, like oohhh, you know little artiste or little dilettante or you know, and, and I resented that and it always gnawed at me.  And so I continued but there were always these moments during the course of my art making career where I wanted something else.  I wanted to earn a pay check.  I wanted to go somewhere you know and do something.
Story_ID: 178267
Speaker 1: So interspersed between a career as an artist, I worked for Myra Everett who was a fashion designer.  And I worked, and then I worked with a company called Corporate Concierge which was about fine--I was--I don't even want to go into it.  But I did a variety of things trying to find somewhere that I could feel good about myself, that I could use my artistic expertise, I could use my business acumen.  But interestingly during those years too, I was very much involved as a wife and my husband [HM Dr. Maurice F. Rabb]'s career was moving forward and every year he went to the National Medical Association and participated you know in that meeting and I hated aspects of that meeting because it was so much--all the, many--not all them, but many of the women there to me were so tied up in being doctors' wives and that was their be-all and their end-all and I just resented that cause I--that wasn't my identity.  And so I told Maurice I wasn't going to anymore of the meet--I didn't want to go to another luncheon.  I didn't want to go to anymore of these cocktail parties.  I just didn't like it.  I said the only way I'll go is if I can bring my art and sell it there and he said oh, okay.  So they had two kinds of ways that you could exhibit.  One was the auxiliary.  The women's auxiliary had a market kind of place where you had clothes and this and all kinds of stuff and jewelry and then there was another where it was the pharmaceutical where the doctors went to buy medicines and supplies and equipment.  Well I managed to go into the pharmaceutical exhibition space and I had a booth there for years.  Every year I had a booth there and I built a very, very strong and loyal following.  And people bought my art every year and they took it seriously and they collected it and it paid my, paid my rent. Every time I did that show my whole rent was paid for that year.  And then I manufactured note cards so I really--I worked hard.  And--but that still, it just didn't do it enough for me.
Story_ID: 178268
Speaker 1: And then something very life changing happened to me.  I was, by this time I was in my late thirties.  I had a decent track record in--of exhibitions.  I was in collections but I just didn't like the isolation of being in the studio. And it was about that time that my brother Billy [William H. Murphy, Jr.] had been elected judge in Baltimore [Maryland] and he and my father [HM William H. Murphy, Sr.] served on the bench together.  They were the first father and son to serve on the bench.  And so I went out to Baltimore for the celebration and I remember feeling so angry at him and so envious.  I mean I was like so jealous of my brother. It was like, why is it that here he is just two years older than I am and he's got all this recognition and he's accomplished this and he's a lawyer and you know and I just, I was just--and so I remember sitting around the table talking to my mother [Madeline Wheeler Murphy] and sister and I told them exactly that.  I said you know, I'm so proud of Billy.  I don't take it away from him but what about me.  I feel--I don't feel like I've accomplished anything.  So they looked at me and they said, "Okay so what are you going to do about it?"  I said I don't know but I--they said well I think--they said you know, it sounds like a personal problem.  You need to figure it out.  And I think it was at that moment that I actually articulated what I was feeling, that I was angry, that I wanted something else and I put it out there. I said it.  And I think there's a lot to be said for doing that where you just, you know you're mentally dealing with this.  You can't always articulate but something happens that makes you just say it.  And so I think after that point, I had a mindset where I was then beginning to say to people, listen I want a job or I want to do something else, I think I have something else to contribute.
Story_ID: 178269
Speaker 1: And so it was also during that period where Harold Washington was being touted as a possible candidate [for mayor of Chicago, Illinois].  There was a groundswell among the people.  He became a people candidate you know, and there's all this energy for voter registration and all of that.  And there was something about him that just struck a chord with me and I said I like this man and I became involved in his campaign early on.  Artists for Washington, I lent art for the offices, I you know, I campaigned for him. I worked very hard for him and ultimately before the February primary, was so excited about him that I wanted to host a fundraiser.  And by that time we lived in Kenwood [Chicago, Illinois].  We had an enormous house at the corner of 48th and Woodlawn.  And Beverly Robinson who was married to Max Robinson at the time, and I, decided we were going to do couples.  Max Robinson and [HM Dr.] Maurice Rabb and--well Max couldn't get involved in politics and so Maurice said well why don't you and Beverly do it, you know?
Speaker 2: Cause Max was a--
Speaker 1: An ABC Anchor (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) news anchor for ABC, right.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  So we did it at my house cause I had--
Speaker 2: He's an artist too.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So we did it at my house and you would have been astounded to know at--how--when I started talking to people that I knew--by that time I was involved in the black middle class you know.  I was very much a part of it and knew lots of people and called them to tell them what I was doing and said, "Would you like to be part of the committee?"  And people said, "You know Mad, I think it's a great idea but I don't think I want to put my name on it."  I'm saying, "Huh?" "Well you know if he loses, Jane Byrne is vindictive and you know that--I don't know.  We'll help you but we're not going to put our name on the list."  So hey, I said, more power to you.  We did it.  And so we had this fundraiser in my house and we had wall-to-wall people.  The black bourgeoisie came out in full force.  I rai- we raised a lot of money for him.  And I liked--and I do believe that that was a significant event in that it galvanized--and people for the first time heard him talk. We had [HM] John Conyers [Jr.] there.  My son did this wonderful poem about Jane Byrne.  It was a wonderful evening and people heard him, touched him, talked to him, listened to him and began to support him.  And it was interesting, there was a--and then there were people who were trying to tag on--some of the liberal Jewish community in Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois], wanted to join in on my fundraiser and I said, "No.  This is about what it is."  And so, I did it because it was the right thing to do and it was something that I felt passionate about and of course looking back at my history of political involvement I hadn't been involved politically in Chicago up until that point because I had left Baltimore [Maryland], I had politics up to here.  But suddenly you know this call, this gene kicked in and so, I did it.  That was it.
Story_ID: 178270
Speaker 1: And then later that summer, my brother [William H. "Billy" Murphy] ran for mayor in Baltimore [Maryland] and I had a fundraiser--and Harold Washington went on to be elected [mayor of Chicago, Illinois].  My brother had a fundraiser--I hosted a fundraiser for my brother who was running for mayor and Harold Washington came and it was a big group.  That time I had no problem getting people to join this committee.  And we had this huge fundraiser for my brother and Harold Washington spoke and I was on my back porch and we had a microphone and so you know, I get this microphone, I'm standing there looking at all these people and all of a sudden I say you know, I kind of like this.  I can do this.  You know I can talk in front of people.  I like you know, I liked it.  It felt good you know.  And like, maybe I'm on to something here, you know.  Well shortly afterwards I got a call from one of the mayor's people saying that he was going to fire the Director of Fine Arts.  Would I be interested in submitting my resume?  Well by this time it had been February, it was June.  I had actually gone away for six weeks to a retreat to paint in the Delaware Water Gap.  I had--and I had come back with all these wonderful paintings and it was almost as though I was gearing up again to get back in the studio and feel confident about it and then came this call.  And so I told my husband that I'd gotten this phone call, that Harold Washington wanted my resume.  And I said--you know I just looked stupid.  And he looked at me, he said so what's the worst that could happen that you give him your resume?  And so I pulled this resume together and I--and when I looked at what I had been doing, it didn't look bad.  Been on the Board of the South Side Community Arts Center, the DuSable Museum [of African American History, Chicago, Illinois], I'd been on the auxiliary board of the Museum of Contemporary Art [Chicago, Illinois].  I had developed roots in the arts community and knew the black art community very well and some of the white art community.  So I wasn't--so I didn't hear from him and I'd sort of given up.  You know I was painting and doing my thing in my studio.  And then I got a call way late in October, November that the mayor wanted to have a meeting with me.  And I'm saying, oh my god.  So he's you know, I'm thinking you know, I'm competing against, you know and I've got to get my plan together about what I'd do if--you know.  So I go into this office.  It was late and, oh I can't who remember who his chief of staff was.  He has died now and he--
Speaker 2: Was it [Ernest] Barefield [sic, William Ware] at that point?
Speaker 1: No, I was before Barefield.
Speaker 2: I don't know who it is (unclear).
Speaker 1: And so I come into his office and he says--you know, I tried to jump in you know and talk about what I would do and he says, he said, when can you start?  And it's like (makes surprise sound), when can I start?  And then he says, but I know you're going to have to ask your husband.  What did he say that for?  It was like, Mr., that's not the way I operate, you know.  And I said I can start next week.  And one of--and--I can't think of his name.  It may come to me.  He said, "Mr. Mayor I think you're making a mistake here.  She comes from the Murphy women.  You know Laura Murphy and Madeline Murphy?  They, they don't like that kind of stuff.  And he said, oh, oh, I'm, I'm sorry Mrs. Rabb.  He used to call me Mrs. Rabb.  So I left the office, it was right before Thanksgiving and I'm saying, oh my god, what have I done?  And I come home and I tell Maurice.  He says that's wonderful.  When do you start?  I said I start in two weeks.  I ended up starting the first week in December and it was like, uh what have I gotten myself into?
Speaker 2: This is December of '80--
Speaker 1: Eighty-three [1983].
Speaker 2: --three [1983], okay.
Speaker 1: And so you know they had this little picture of me in the paper and I'm like, I don't believe it.  And so began seven and a half years of an extraordinary experience, extraordinary.
Story_ID: 178271
Speaker 1: Now what were some of the milestones?  I know we mentioned earlier that we had before the Chicago Office of Fine Arts--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) was elevated to cabinet status--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --(unclear).  How did that take place?
Speaker 2: Well what happened was, I was appointed in December and then his people reminded him that they were going to make it a cabinet level pos--department.  And so he realized that he needed to move on that.  And so I had been ensconced in my office there for several months and the mayor decided to create the Department of Cultural Affairs and he appointed the first Commissioner, Fred Fine.  And the interesting thing about it was that the mayor really didn't know Fred and--he knew me.  And so for many months, almost a year, I went--I was a member of the mayor's cabinet and I went to the cabinet meetings and then gradually got shifted out and Fred became part of the mayor's cabinet.  But I always had the mayor's ear and Fred knew it and respected it.  And so a lot of lobbying for money, lobbying for budget increases I was able to do because of that relationship with the mayor.  It was a tough period there creating the Department of Cultural Affairs, deciding what it was going to look like, what it was going to do.  But most of the responsibility for running the department rested on me for the first few years.  I was over the Public Art Program, all of the grants making, all of--
Speaker 1: So they didn't have a public art person at that point?
Speaker 2: They had a public art person but the Public Art Program was in the department of--where the architects department was and it was the responsibility of that department to let us know when new buildings were being taken, being built so that we could implement the purchase or commission of art.  And it had sort of languished and we weren't getting information and the person who was in my office was working for another department and we weren't getting the respect from that department for the Public Art Program.  And so I was able to move that position out of the Department of Housing or I can't remember what department it was.  But I finessed it so that that department became a part of the Department of Cultural Affairs and we had oversight over it.
Speaker 1: Now that's an important program because--
Speaker 2: Very important.
Speaker 1: --a lot of people don't know much about it but local, state and federal all stipulate that a percentage of capital development money should go to public art works, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And those public art works were commissioned on the local level through the Chicago Office of Fine Arts.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 178272
Speaker 1: And I sat on the committee that oversaw that and there was some controversy involved in that.  It was all--when I took my position they had already commissioned an artist to do a fresco at one of the regional libraries.  And the public was up in arms about this fresco because the artist Irene Siegel was using language in it.  And they said our neighborhood is filled with graffiti.  Why would we have graffiti in the library?  You remember?
Speaker 2: Is that the Sulzer Library [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Yes.  And they claimed that the pro--that the process hadn't been followed and that--so I ended up being sued.  I and the Director of Public Art were being sued because the--we were being accused by the community of not following the guidelines.  And so, I'll never forget one evening this, all this controversy swirling around and my atti--and so the, at that time the department was still managed by the architect in another department and he unbeknownst to me told the artist to stop working and I was like furious.  And so I got a phone call from the press.  My husband [HM Dr. Maurice F. Rabb] is looking at me on the telephone saying (making hand gesture) don't talk to them.  Don't talk to them.  Well I got seduced and the last words I remember were saying, come hell or high water the artist is going to gonna go back to work.  So the next day it was in the paper.  That same evening we had gone to a public meeting in the community where I was supposed to be listening objectively to all the conversation and they really wanted me to get rid of the artist and to not continue with it.  So we had--we're defending the program and having all this conversation and so nobody mentions the newspaper and I'm saying whew, nobody saw the paper.  So somebody finally says, "Mrs. Rabb, you were quoted in the paper.  It sounds to me like you've already made up your mind that you want the artist to go back to work and where you stand on it.  Were you actually accurately quoted?"  And so I paused for just a millisecond and I said absolutely, I was quoted accurately.  Yes, the artist in my opinion needs to go back and we need to move on with this and, you know.  Well fortunately I did the right thing because the person who had written the article was right there in the audience and if I had lied she would have just (laughter).
Story_ID: 178273
Speaker 1: --So it was an amazing time and some of the things that I discovered during that period were that so many small arts organizations in the minority community be they black, Hispanic, Asian, Hmong whatever, were not getting grants.  And we had a grant program where we had a so-called peer review process where members of the art community would come together and make decisions about applications.
Speaker 2: Now this was new, was it not?  I mean it wasn't it sort of (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Well this was in place.
Speaker 2: It was already in place.
Speaker 1: But the difference was I would sit in on these panel meetings and I'd see these wonderful poorly written applications come across the table, but where art was being made in unconventional places.  And so we had purists on the panel who, you know if it wasn't in a gallery, if it wasn't in a traditional art making place, if the performance was in the basement of a church or if it was in a school, you know, we couldn't fund that.  It just didn't meet our criteria, you know.  And I said this is where the people are making art.
Story_ID: 178274
Speaker 1: Now that goes to the--now when you became the head of the Chicago Office of Fine Arts [Chicago, Illinois], I guess it was about maybe twenty years after the--maybe not that long, after the country established the National Endowment for the Arts, right? That was established under the [President Lyndon Baines] Johnson Administration. His wife, Lady Bird [Claudia Taylor Johnson], was the one that really--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --pushed for that.  And from what I understand, and you correct me if I'm wrong, it was Jessie Woods here in Chicago, that pushed for something that they called the Expansion Arts Program which--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, Jessie Woods was the first chair.  Because when the Department of Cultural Affairs was created, there was created an advisory panel and Jessie Woods was the first chair.  And members of leading cultural institutions and various people were appointed to this committee that met to talk about the goals and the objectives of the department and to approve and recommend things, you know to the department, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: No issue of minority art I mean was I think debated in the beginning, like what is it and what, you know, why can't they just mainstream like every, you know?
Speaker 2: Well that be--
Speaker 1: It speaks to a whole cultural question--
Speaker 2: Well it does.
Speaker 1: --is America one culture or is it (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Exactly.  Well these were issues that were being debated but at the base, on the city level if, regardless of the expansion arts funds, if you couldn't get to the local arts agency and get funding you couldn't get to the state, you couldn't get to the federal.  And so here I saw these applications constantly being thrown back as not qualified, not this, not that and I said there's something wrong here.  And what I proceeded to do was to change the composition of the panels so that the panels particularly for this level of funding or this type of grant making program had people who knew what was going on in the communities.  So you needed teachers, you needed parents, you needed art teachers.  I mean you needed a whole different mix.  Not exclusively that, but so that the voices of people who knew the community were present in the decision making process.  And so I created a whole--and encouraged my staff to find people in the neighborhoods who were activists, who were involved in their communities who knew what was going on, to become part of these panels so that these panels became much more community based as well as artistically based, and we saw a tremendous difference in who got funded.  The other area that really upset me was the fact that so many black artists and Hispanic and artists of color were not getting funded for exhibitions or for grants and a lot of what had happened was there--prior to my getting there, that that depart, that office was like off limits to people.  People didn't just come into the Office of Fine Arts and ask questions and get information.  Most people didn't know what was going on there and they didn't know that there were opportunities.  And so we became much more out in the community talking, holding workshops, teaching people, having--inviting people to come to the department and learn about grant making, learn about the programs, pick up applications, get coaching, talk to the staff.  And so there became a much more open door policy and as a result, many more organizations got funding.  I remember, oh he's doing so well, Freeman [Maestro Paul Freeman], he has a symphony, Sinfonietta. Sinfonietta was an example that was--of a small organization that was doing very, very well.  They didn't fulfill the guidelines.  They were operating out of the city and I encouraged them to come into the city so that they would qualify for funding, and they did.  And they got their first funding through the Department of Cultural Affairs and look at where they are now, you know.  So I think I brought a different perspective to the arts that I wasn't a purist, I wasn't an elitist and I had a mandate from the mayor [Harold Washington].  The mayor said, Mrs. Rabb, I want you to make the arts more inclusive, you know.  I want you to make you know, make a difference.  And certainly didn't do it alone but certainly did have his support and also the will coming from my background, you know.  I knew as a practicing artist how hard it was to get a show, to get listened to.
Story_ID: 178275
Speaker 1: Well, talk about some of the other groups and artists that this made a difference for.  You know, don't--first of all the elevation of the office to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, cabinet, I mean to a--
Speaker 1: --cabinet level.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a cabinet level position.  That was very significant.
Speaker 1: It was the first time in the history of the city that--
Speaker 2: (No audible response) (Shaking head yes)
Speaker 1: --cultural affairs and arts had been--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --elevated to that level.
Speaker 2: That's right.  And there was the cultural plan that was done.  Fred Fine, that was one of his biggest accomplishments, talking about what the needs of the communities were, bringing them together to have these dialogues and conversations and writing a plan.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right, that's the process--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --it took two years at least.
Speaker 2: Two years yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now that seems to be the culmination of what we all hope for and then the mayor died, you know.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And I don't know what happened to the plan after the mayor died.  What happened?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  I'm sure some aspects of it were implemented but not to the degree that was desired.
Speaker 1: Because just the process itself was just, was refreshing because the question was taken to the people. You know, what do you want in your neighborhood, in your community in terms of culture?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about that cause you (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well you that wasn't--well I--that was not a project that I was spearheading.  It was really Fred Fine and Nick Rabkin's project and Michael Dorf.  And so they got the funding for it and so it was sort of outside of my jurisdiction so it wasn't something that I was involved with on a day to day basis.  I was running other aspects of the department at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It was really a dramatic thing though (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes it was.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It was.
Story_ID: 178276
Speaker 1: Well tell us about some of the other activities--
Speaker 2: In the department?
Speaker 1: --in the department.
Speaker 2: God, it seems like ancient history.  I guess one of the things that I take a certain amount of pride in is the exhibition program and we have wonderful spaces in the Cultural Center [Chicago Cultural Center].  And the process for selecting artists to exhibit was like an old boy network and I think that's the most dramatic thing that I learned in this--in these years of how small and intimate and exclusive the art community is.  And it's who you know, curators know one another.  They change institutions.  They have access to people at institutions that they left so they can call their fellow curator and talk about an exhibit you know that you need to take. And so part of my job was to educate my staff about who was out there, besides themselves, that looked like them.  And so I brought in people from the Studio Museum in Harlem [New York, New York] and Beryl Wright who was a wonderful scholar who I recommended come to the Museum of Contemporary Art [Chicago, Illinois].  And so I played a role of communicating and because I'm a visual artist I had a certain bias toward that.  Hughie Lee Smith, an artist who died last year, had his first show at the Cultural Center.  Martin Puryear, an internationally renowned artist had a show at the Cultural Center, Hispanic artists.  And fortunately the staff became much more open and began to pursue a lot of the leads that I gave them about who they needed to be talking to and so I take a great deal of pride in that.  And one of the other things that people may not have known was that when we were in the Cultural Center we were like tenants in the building.  It was owned by the library.  And John Duff was the commissioner at that time and they were moving to build the new Harold Washington Library.  They were half-hearted about the Cultural Center, but they were still needing the space and so a lot of conversations that I had with John Duff, I was able to charm him into relinquishing more and more and more space to the Department of Cultural Affairs.  And it was I and my staff who wrote the first plan for the future use of the cultural center.  We had a whole blueprint for how that building needed to be used.  And I remember Sharon Killian used to get so annoyed with me because I was constantly saying what are we going to do when the library moves out?  Who's going to take it over?  It ought to come to the Department of Cultural Affairs.  And so there is a booklet that I--with Holabird and Root who consulted with us to look at the building and to decide how it ought to be used.  And that report was completed right as Daley [Richard M. Daley] came in and so that report never saw my signature or the light of day.  But ultimately many, many, many of the things that I recommended came to be in that building.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So it is a people's palace you know and that's how I saw it then.
Story_ID: 178277
Speaker 1: Yeah.  One thing I remember about those days is that there seemed to be a high level of education about what the cultural life of this city [Chicago, Illinois], the state of the cultural life of the city and the people were really concern--you know really met.  They took a lot of time to meet--the Illinois Hearts Alliance Foundation--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --would meet about these things.  And there was discussion I know when Mayor Daley [Richard M. Daley] was elected about whether he was going to be a knucklehead or somebody that would--
Speaker 2: Support the arts.
Speaker 1: --support the arts, yeah.
Speaker 2: And we had gotten him poised, poised to embrace it.  You know I remember getting a call from somebody, the mayor was invited to go to--oh, Ardis [Joan] Krainik called me.  She said, I've invited mayor [Mayor Harold Washington]--the mayor to the opening of the Lyric [Lyric Opera House].  Is he coming or not?  And he's got to be in a tuxedo cause the mayor hated to dress to in a tuxedo.  And you know I'd have to get on and call Delores [ph.] his secretary.  Delores, he's got to go.  This is very important.  I said this affects him politically because I said all the movers and shakers who he needs to be having relationships with attend these cultural events.  I said it's politically wise as well as important for the arts, you know.  And so I was constantly having to coerce and push the mayor to participate in some of the arts activities.  I have pictures of him going to Art Expo where he's--the expression on his face looking at some of this art is just priceless, you know.  But I just loved him.  I just loved him.
Story_ID: 178278
Speaker 1: What was the hardest part of being director of the department?
Speaker 2: I think the hardest part was dealing with the government bureaucracy, you know to get things done.  I hated that aspect of it.  And then I didn't like all the various layers and I think that I had a real clear agenda and my agenda was about inclusiveness.  And that wasn't always a popular agenda.  I used to have the moniker of "Ms. Cultural Diversity" and it wasn't a compliment because I was always concerned about who's on the panel, what's the make-up, how are you going to reach out to diverse communities, what do the numbers look like, what are the percentages, you know who's participating, who's not?  And I became quite an advocate and lectured all across the country, wrote articles, gave papers, gave keynote speeches about how you go about making the arts more inclusive.  And one of the things that happened that I'll never forget was early on in my job I had gotten a call from the Smithsonian Institution and they had had an exhibit that they wanted to bring to Chicago at the Art Institute [Art Institute of Chicago] and it was Five African American Masters.  And so Jim Wood [James N. Wood] had just become director and Katherine [C.] Lee was the vice president of the Art Institute.  And so they kept calling.  I said, well I'd be happy to take the exhibit at the [Chicago] Cultural Center.  But we didn't qualify because we weren't a museum and we didn't have the humidity control and security that they needed and they really wanted it at the Art Institute.  And so I had breakfast with Katherine Lee and Jim Wood to talk about this proposal and I said I know it's on the curator's desk.  It's been there.  It's been languishing there and they sort of looked a little sheepish and they said yeah, yeah we know, we know but he doesn't want to take it.  And in museums it's very interesting how much power the curators have.  And I said well it would make a lot of sense, I said particularly in light of what you're trying to do.  You're trying to bring more people to the museums and make it more inclusive.  I said this is a perfect opportunity.  And so I convinced them to take the show and what I didn't know was that the show wasn't being managed by the curatorial department, it was being managed by the education department, unheard of in a museum.  Curators curate shows and put shows on.  Education departments educate the public about what's going on.  The education department put this show on and we created this enormous collaboration, African American Masters from the 1800s and African American Photography from a parallel period of time.  And these were two major collab--exhibits, and it was a collaboration among the Department of Cultural Affairs and the Art Institute of Chicago and it was a blockbuster.  Do you remember?
Speaker 1: I remember.
Speaker 2: And we created a committee of people to talk about how we reached the community and how we publicized it and we had public programs all around it.
Speaker 1: Who were the artists again?  There was Tanner [Henry Ossawa Tanner] I believe and--
Speaker 2: Tanner, Edmonia Lewis.  I've got the catalog right here.
Speaker 1: Duncanson [Robert Scott Duncanson] was--?
Speaker 2: Duncanson and the fifth--I'm getting old.  Five--oh here it is.  I just happened to have it.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Sharing traditions.  So, I can't see.  I'll let you look.  I can't remember.  But anyway, this was an incredible undertaking.  And what happened as a result was--and the thing that I was concerned about--
Speaker 1: Joshua Johnson, Robert Scott Duncanson, Edward Mitchell Bannister, Edmonia Lewis and Henry Ossawa Tanner.
Speaker 2: Ossawa [pronounced Ah-suh-wuh] Tanner, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: What I was concerned about was that the public, not just African Americans, but that the general public know the contributions of artists of color.  And that you know we are up there, we are doing wonderful work.  We have the credentials, the competency as any other artist.  I had the opportunity to convince the Museum of Contemporary Art [Chicago, Illinois] to take a show that the Studio Museum in Harlem [New York, New York] curated on Romare Beardon.  They didn't want to take it.  So I, I've real--
Speaker 1: Now Romare Bearden is opening up at the Smithsonian.
Speaker 2: At the Smithsonian, you know.  But they didn't know a lot about him and you know it was like, I was like crazed.  But I had this woman on my shoulder, Laura Wheeler Waring, my great aunt who didn't get the recognition that she deserved, telling me to keep pushing, to keep pushing and so that's what I was doing.  It was exhausting though.  It was relentless, just relentless.
Story_ID: 178279
Speaker 1: Now some strange things happened I think around that period of time it--tell me if you remember the story that an Edmonia Lewis sculpture was discovered in the suburbs?  Do you remember that?
Speaker 2: No I don't.
Speaker 1: Or was it Edmonia?  I think it was Edmonia Lewis.  Well I won't talk about that if you don't remember it.  Yeah, but there was an exhibit--there is a--the visual arts community is very tight as you said and very kind of closed off. And they run in the same circles.  They all know each other and they all know the artists.  But there was a, there was an exhibit that caused a big controversy--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --at the Department of Cultural Affairs.  You want to talk about that?
Speaker 2: Oh, the bane of my--
Speaker 1: And that speaks to that closed off--
Speaker 2: Well you know it--
Speaker 1: --blind judging and (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well you know what hap--
Speaker 1: Blind judging (unclear).
Speaker 2: This whole thing of peer review, blind judging, the Art Institute of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] used to have a Chicago Show every two years.  And so we got the bright idea that we needed to bring something back that would be about Chicago artists.  And so here my past history had been inclusiveness and, but always concerns about why more artists weren't, more black artists weren't part of the mix and why, you know always pressing for more inclusiveness.  So we get this committee together with the Art Institute of Chicago and the Museum of Contemporary Art [Chicago, Illinois] and the Chicago Office of Fine Arts Exhibition Program to do this important exhibit of Chicago artists.  And we publicized it, we sent applications everywhere.  We had a diverse panel of black artists and white artists and equally, you know I mean the whole mix was there with the goal of having a well mixed show.  So the number come back and they're few artists of color who make the cut.  And I sat there through the review process.  Some of the work didn't hold up.  Some artists didn't apply. There were a lot of artists who didn't apply because they were so distrustful and some who did apply, the work wasn't good.  That's the fact.  Well, all this hype about this wonderful Chicago show and few minorities.  And so here I am oh, my god, I have done, we have done everything that's supposed to make the outcome more inclusive but at the end of the day I truly believe that we had done a fair process.  And guess what, that's the way it turned out but that did not fly.
Speaker 1: Now it's funny because the people, I think after they saw the results--
Speaker 2: But wait a minute, there's more--
Speaker 1: --they got more excited than they did when they saw the announcement for the--
Speaker 2: For these to apply?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, because they were like naysayers, ah, you know this is one of those things, they're not going to get--you know, so a lot of the mouthy artists didn't even fill in the application or send in their slides, okay.  And we were out there you know hyping it.  But then when the buzz became like this is a serious thing.  There's a catalog, there's a whole big thing.  It was a very serious undertaking.  There were people who were furious that they didn't get in or that they didn't know about it.  And so here I was, Ms. Cultural Diversity on the spot.  So, so what's the deal lady?  Where are the minority artists?  And I'm saying, we stood on our hands and did--we followed a process and a process that was legitimate and authentic and reasonable and this is what it is.  And my attitude was, and that's the show.  Well Lois Weisberg was not happy.  She was the Commissioner then.  And by this time Mayor [Richard M.] Daley had come in, he wasn't happy.  And we had--I'll never forget, we sat around this table and I had spoken to Lois about the outcome of the exhibit and I said I stand behind it and she said well I support you cause I explained, you know what we had done.  So then we have a meeting of all the participants in this collaboration, the Art Institute, the Museum of Contemporary Art, the Commissioner's person Nick Rabkin, Lois Weisberg and we have a discussion about the outcome.  Everybody's disappointed and the white institutions are particularly upset you know because you know well what are we going to do?  And I'm saying we followed the process.  It was a fair process.  And unfortunately it didn't happen the way had hoped it happened and I was in support of it.  So having had this conversation with Lois, she then says, "Oh no, you're going to have to fix it."  I said I beg your pardon?  "You're going to have to fix it."  It's going to have to be more inclusive.  You're going to have to include some Black and Hispanic artists.  And I said no I'm not.  I'm not going to be a part of that.  And everybody sort of looked at me and Greg Knight looked at me and he was like oh my god.  I said I don't operate like--I'm not doing it.  So she instructed the exhibition department to make it happen and so artists were invited.  And to my way of thinking it was like Salon des refuses [French, meaning "exhibition of rejects"], where you had a second class level of artists who were invited just because it had to fit some numbers.  And that's when I knew I couldn't play the politics anymore.
Story_ID: 178280
Speaker 1: But in retrospect do you think--I don't really remember.  I wish I could remember exactly how that process worked.  But was it the best process in retrospect when you look back at it?  Would there be anything about it that you would change?  Seems like I remember something about the judging panel representing the Art Institute [of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], Museum of Contemporary Art [Chicago, Illinois], help me out, I don't know if (unclear).
Speaker 2: We had--I think we had-[HM] Marva [Pitchford] Jolly was part of that.  There were I don't know how many.  I don't remember the composition.  Probably in hindsight it could have probably been different but I don't know you know--
Speaker 1: I remember the judging was blind judging with the judges looking at slides, at the signatures of the artists. But and then there was Carlos Tortolero, [HM] Ausbra Ford were basically the two artists in the community, in the Black community and the Mexican community--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah they gave me--
Speaker 1: --to speak out--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --against it. They represented a lot of you know people that seemed to be outraged about it.  And I agree with you, I think that a lot of folks came to it late after it had already happened and got outraged rather than on the front end of it.
Speaker 2: But you know what, I think this is the dilemma that I've had all my professional career about how do you do it?  How do you make the arts more inclusive and what is the process?  And is it based on color?  Is it based on race?  Shouldn't the art carry itself and not have to deal with, you know?  But because I know the process to this day of how people get selected, how they get chosen, it's who you know, it's talent, it's being in the right place at the right time, it's being collected by certain patrons.  I mean there is the politics, the very, very serious politics of being a successful artist.  And how do African American artists fit in and how do they get to be a part of that?  And in some instances the only way is for there to be a show of African American art where people can see the talent that is out there because it wouldn't be seen in any other way.  And I have ambivalence about black shows, but at the same time my whole career and profession now is creating opportunities for people to collect work by African American artists.  And I don't know the answer to that and I know artists who are very well established, who will not be in a black show, who say, I am beyond that.  I want to be recognized for my work as an artist, not the color of my skin.  My work is not black my work is art you know.
Speaker 1: But equally there are, and maybe even more so, are more artists that say that they are black artists.
Speaker 2: (No audible response.)
Speaker 1: And they're--they produce art from a black perspective.
Speaker 2: But you know what, when you look at what black artists create, it is as different as our color, our class, every our experiences.  So there is in my opinion not a universal black art.  It is everything that an artist is exposed to you know their beliefs and their values, what they see.
Story_ID: 178281
Speaker 1: But that was one of the most painful, I must tell you it was the most painful period in my career but I knew it was time to go because I was not going to battle with Lois Weisberg about the politics.  I was not going to compromise.  And you asked me did we do the right thing?  Did we go about it in the right way?  I'm sure it could have been improved but hindsight is 20/20.  Ultimately a number of artists who did, who were included in the show were absolutely delighted to be in the show.  There was a little asterisk next to their name which I would never in life want to have but it was that they were invited you know.
Speaker 2: Names like--yeah, right.  Now I remember the asterisk and that they--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: That (unclear) a lot of people.
Speaker 1: It did.  I mean so you know I said you know I said how is an artist going to feel to be an asterisk in an exhibit, you know?  But then there were artists who said I don't give a damn whether it's an asterisk or a question mark.  I want to be at the Cultural Center [Chicago Cultural Center] in that book in that show and that was their right, you know.  But that's where I said, um-um, this is not what I want to be a part of anymore.  And so I jumped out there.  I jumped out with all the information that I had acquired, being a practicing artist, being in the studio and being an arts administrator and traveling all over the country going to workshops and panels and you know in my profession, I learned so much and I am eternally grateful to Harold Washington for giving me that opportunity.  So I've taken it somewhere else.
Story_ID: 178282
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we have a new chapter.
Speaker 1: And so what do you do now?  What do you do now?
Speaker 2: When I left the City of Chicago I had been on a panel that was putting public art at Cityfront Place, the outside of Cityfront Place, Chicago Dock and Canal.  And once again it was one of those situations where, pardon me, I was on this panel with curators from museums and they, you know they had all these white boys, sculptors that they knew and they you know always putting them forward and I would bring forth some names and they said uhh (inaudible response), you know, umm, you know, I'm saying here I go again.  So I was very frustrated.  I was always frustrated.  Quality, don't know about them, who are they?  And it's like oh gee, give me a friggin break.  I want to do my own thing, screw 'em.  So one of the people on the panel running it said to me you know Cityfront Place is building a high rise and they're going to need art in that building.  I'd like to recommend you know that you'd be the person to do it.  So I said great.  So I got a call and they asked me to come and they were just starting Cityfront Place and it was a trailer you know a rental trailer.  So they just had this little rental room and they said well we need a piece of art.  Can you get me a piece of art?  So I said sure.  So I said okay, here I go.  Where do I go?  Went to [HM] Isobel Neal Gallery, I got a couple of pieces from her, showed them to them, they bought one, I bought it from her and placed it.  And so then they said well we've got ten floors that we're doing.  We need art for each floor, one print on each floor.  I said, fine.  So then I go home and I said now where the hell am I going to get these prints?  And once again it was always about inclusiveness and you know making opportunities you know for artists of color.  And so I couldn't find--and I needed sort of corporate looking art, art that was not political, that was not figurative, that was simply beautiful.  And so I began to go through my rolodex and call artists who I knew were doing that kind of work all over the country and I called Brandywine Workshop and I talked to a lot of people and I was able to amass a ton of works on paper which I got from all over the country, some locally but mostly out of the city.  Right here in my apartment I was working in this very room.  I had stacks of prints and so then I presented the prints to the client and they selected you know so for every ten prints that you need, you have to show maybe thirty, you know.  So here I have all the, all of this artwork that I need to send back so at the same time Urban Gateways was doing these little soirees where the members--they had a young board and they would have events for them.  And so they asked if I would host a soiree in my home because they knew that we had an art collection and so I said sure.  And so I invited these young future collectors to my home and I had all of these prints by all of these African American artists that I showed them, many of whom they had never heard of or never had had an opportunity to be exposed to and they bought prints, $250.00, $350.00, $700.00, and for many of them it was a lot of money.  And after that I would start inviting African American artists to come to my home and talk about their work and so Margo Humphrey was an artist who I had here, John Dowell was another one, Ed Clark.  And so I would have these events, which was about learning about how to collect. And so what started as this sort of corporate business became a private collection business to start.
Story_ID: 178283
Speaker 1: --And you know as we were talking, the odds for the success of that show were two against one to be successful because we had the Art Institute [of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] who had their group of curators and people, the Museum of Contemporary Art ["MCA," Chicago, Illinois] who had their cure--and we had our group.  And so you said something interesting which I had forgotten and which I recall occurred to me at the time, it was weighted against us to begin with because everybody--blind reviewing or not, the curators at the Art Institute know people, the curators at the MCA know people.  They don't know the people that we knew, the more community based artists so you know they didn't know anything about them.  But we recognized them but we were outvoted.  So going into it, it was destined--it was destined not to succeed.  I remember now.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it seemed like a very unfortunate squeeze for--
Speaker 1: It was.
Speaker 2: --for well intentioned people.  That, that's--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --how (unclear) at the time.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: I think the most irate was Carlos Tortolero from the Mexican--
Speaker 1: Oh, god yes.
Speaker 2: --Fine Arts Museum.  [HM] Ausbra Ford was indignant--
Speaker 1: Well I--
Speaker 2: --but maybe in a little slightly different (unclear).
Speaker 1: But I recall now, I'm glad you--I'm glad we had this conversation cause we do need to correct the record because I remember sitting there cause I wasn't on the committee seeing stuff go by that I'm saying (makes sound) you know and looking at the vote.  You know and I'm saying, oh man, you know, cause the white curators they didn't know them.  They didn't you know they didn't like it, you know.  So yeah it was two against one, it was ill-advised.  It couldn't succeed.  The numbers weren't there.  The--you're right.  You're absolutely right.  And I think I realized it probably after it started chugging along and I said--and I took the fall.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, you know I think a lot of people--
Speaker 1: I took the fall.
Speaker 2: --felt that it was like an unfortunate kind of--
Speaker 1: It was.  It was a good idea--
Speaker 2: --(unclear) in the beginning.
Speaker 1: --that was not--
Speaker 2: It just didn't--
Speaker 1: It didn't work.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, and not because it wasn't intended to work--
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: --it just, because it just didn't.
Speaker 1: It couldn't have worked.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know, now I remember.  I think I like pulled the covers over my head and said--
Speaker 2: We used to debate it in the office you know, what went right, what--
Speaker 1: What went wrong?
Speaker 2: --what went wrong?
Speaker 1: And probably said idiots, you know it's not going to work.  Look at who's involved (gestures).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, these things happen.
Story_ID: 178284
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --what you're doing now, you're continuing to do--trying to do the same thing in the position you're in now, to try to get work for--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --minority artists and--?
Speaker 2: Yeah. So I would have these soirees and out of them came collectors with whom I work now but who also then referred me to businesses where they worked.  And one of the businesses was Ariel Capital [sic, Ariel Investments], [HM] John Rogers.  And he was, he had a small office on Michigan Avenue, 1991 and he was beginning to build his business and hire an architect to expand his space.  And one of the employees Eric McKissack, said you know you should call John and I did.  And he put me in touch with his interior designer and architect and I began to build his collection and so I've worked with him since 1991 to the present, building a very fine African American art collection.  And then out of--and then my business began to grow from word of mouth and I have done hospitals.  I just finished doing all of the art for the new Stroger Hospital [John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County], a 1.5 million square foot hospital.  But back to Cityfront Place in 1991, that started with ten floors then another ten floors, then three lobbies and then thirty-nine stories and I thought that's the way my business was going to be, you know million dollar square foot.  I did that project and then began to do smaller projects but the--but I began to realize that what I really care about is providing opportunities to place work by African American artists and building African American art collections.  And so that's--the John Stroger Hospital is like a segue--about four years ago when the hospital was first being discussed, I talked to [HM] John Stroger and I said you know this is what I do.  You know I'd love to do the hospital when it's ready.  Right, forgot all about that.  Two years later, get this phone call, the hospital is ready, getting ready to you know--we've broken ground and we want you to come in and look at the space and you know work with us on the hospital.  I said uhh, that's really not what I'm doing now, you know cause it was posters and all these floors.  And I'll never forget, it was a cold, cold, cold March and I'm walking over, I met with Randy Jones [ph.] and we walk through in the hardhats, Stroger Hospital.  I mean we walked for miles and miles and I can't remember where I started and where I ended and my head is like spinning.  And I said to myself, unh-uh, you don't want to do this.  This is going to take too much time and it's too big. So I call her that, the next day, I said, Randy I don't think so.  I said it's too big.  It's going to take me away from my core business you know.  I said I'm going to have to neglect my other clients.  I said it's just too big.  "What are you talking about?  You can do it."  She said and I trust your taste because we want this hospital to be warm and we want it to be inclusive and we want it to have images that reflect our population and all that, cause I had years ago written this wonderful thing about what the hospital ought to look like and what it ought to represent and the stakeholders and all my, you know, all my jargon and diversity stuff.  And she still had that letter and she said, well you know you laid out what it is we want and you're the person and I trust you and I need you to do this.  She said just think about it over the weekend.  So I reluctantly said yes and it took me a good two years.  They're pleased with it.  It is, it's a beautiful outcome.  And there's a whole range of images that talk to the diverse population and a lot of posters, but the part that I'm most excited about is the cafeteria where there's some wonderful photography and a couple of paintings and--
Speaker 1: How many works of art--?
Speaker 2: Well there are about 500 posters and about 50 original works of art, maybe 30, something like that.  It was a big project and I did neglect my clients during that period.  But everybody who has been--I mean I hear a lot of good feedback so that was worth it because it was like you know I really, really, really care about the people who come into Cook County Hospital and I think they deserve to see something welcoming and warm and that the art reflect, reflected their life experience and they could see themselves in some of the images, you know.  And I said this is important work.
Story_ID: 178285
Speaker 1: Now I think we live in an era now where we have more black galleries probably than ever before, I guess.  And I don't know if I'm--we got--do we still have Nicole Gallery?
Speaker 2: [HM] George [N.] N'Namdi.
Speaker 1: N'Namdi Gallery.
Speaker 2: Yes, and he's about thirty years old, [HM] Nicole [Smith], Susan Woodson does--has a home based gallery, those are the three that had--and then [HM] Isobel Neal had a wonderful gallery.  I think her gallery she had for about ten years and she was representing some wonderful artists but she closed a few years ago.  So I'm sort of--and Akainyah Gallery [HM Samuel Akainyah] which is an individual artists' gallery.  So it's very challenging for people who want to collect to see a range of art because George has a certain group of artists he represents, Nicole and Akainyah just represents himself. And Susan has WPA and some of the younger artists.  So I have a fine art consulting business which is where I have a client, they have a space and we come up with a plan of how to create a collection that is appropriate to the work force and the work place and at the same time having you know, extraordinary work--
Story_ID: 178286
Speaker 1: Now how does an artist get your attention?
Speaker 2: Well basically I have gotten my art based on word of mouth, going to shows, going to galleries, talking to outstanding artists.  Basically I work--I don't work essentially with emerging young artists.  I did that early on.  Right now, I want to place work by artists who have established reputations, they're doing consistently wonderful work, they have, they've been written about you know.  They're serious.  They're professionals from mid-career to old master.  So I usually get other artists who are of similar quality from those artists.
Story_ID: 178287
Speaker 1: So you don't think there's any such thing as a black aesthetic in art?
Speaker 2: Well I think that there is--there are artists who use black subject matter or they have certain imagery that they use that can be African or Afrocentric but I think the art that I'm seeing, I mean it covers the gamut from minimalist to a little dot that you wonder is that a piece of art?  I mean I've got a piece out there that is a red ball.  It's a dot.  It's like the sold sign you see in the museum and this artist did this piece called Red--no, called Sold.  It's a red dot on the wall.  My husband saw it the other day.  He said, what the heck is this?
Speaker 1: And it's called Sold?
Speaker 2: Sold, you know.  And so you know it's like us--all the way two artists doing quilts you know and beadwork and so I mean we represent the range of life experiences, exposure, training, as any other artist.  So you can't always look at a piece of art and say that's a black artist because what is that?  What is a black person?  What is a black--I mean how do you define what a black person is or looks like?
Speaker 1: Well you can on some levels--
Speaker 2: On some level but not always.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know.
Speaker 1: Because it's political too as well as the physical and cultural, you know.
Story_ID: 178288
Speaker 1: Tell us, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: That we participate and not be on the sidelines, that we are active parts of the world, that we are doing and participating and being involved in life and that we're not afraid, that we take risks.  That we be players, we jump in there and have an opinion even if it's the wrong one and that we have the courage of our convictions.  And I think for those who have given much is expected and that we have generations of young people who come from educated families who sacrificed and sent their kids to college and some of whom don't know about the Civil Rights Movement, don't know about the struggles, don't feel like they are entitled, you know that they're self-indulgent and spoiled and don't feel that--they feel like they got there because they just deserved it.  But we all, we all, we all have gotten where we've gotten on our--the shoulders of our ancestors.  And we have an obligation to look back and to help--to help, to participate, to make it better.  And that's what I love about what I do.  I don't think there's anything else I could be doing more than--because you see the galleries and the museums, they make the careers.  And as a businesswoman and an entrepreneur, I think artists need money in their pockets and there's nothing that gives me greater pleasure than writing a check to an artist.  That is nirvana.
Story_ID: 178289
Speaker 1: At this juncture, what would you consider as your legacy? And you're still young.
Speaker 2: My legacy, she wasn't a dilettante.  She was about the business of getting--you know years ago I did a paper at the Smithsonian [Institution, Washington, D.C.] and it was called 'Crusading for Justice in the Arts.' It was in 1991, I'll never forget it.  And among the things that I said was that I looked forward to the day where African American artists commanded the same kinds of prices for their work as their comparable white artists you know.  And you know it was sort of like this clarion call.  Little did I know that that's what my life work would be, a crusader.  So my family is full of crusaders.  You know my sister [HM Laura Murphy] is involved in the ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union] you know, freedom of expression.  My brother's [William "Billy" Murphy, Jr.] a lawyer and political and--we are all sort of driven by crusading for something.  So I'm a crusader for the arts.
Story_ID: 178290
Speaker 1: And something I didn't ask about, let me--I can throw it in here.  But when you talked about ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union], it reminded me of this incident that took place when you were at the department.
Speaker 2: Oh god.
Speaker 1: And that's the famous painting of Harold Washington that was done in ladies' underwear--
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: --and that hung at the Art Institute [of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] and--
Speaker 2: And how they attacked it and took it down?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Some of our aldermen I think they were well-meaning people went over there and tore it down (unclear).
Speaker 2: They did.  They did.
Speaker 1: And arrested the painting (unclear) you know.
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's right.
Speaker 1: There's still I think unresolved lawsuits around that incident.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And did it put you in a squeeze in any kind of way?  I don't know if it did or not but--
Speaker 2: I don't think that it did at that time since it wasn't under my jurisdiction.  It was at the School of the Art Institute [Chicago, Illinois].  Bottom line, freedom of expression you know.  Harold Washington was a much loved and revered leader you know and so people were just furious that anyone would have the audacity to depict him in that way in an unflattering way.  But we're dealing always with artists who take risks, who express a point of view and who have the right to do that.  And this is the country where you have the right to do--you know like the flag thing, stepping on the flag, drag--
Speaker 1: And that occurred around the same period?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, so I support an artist's freedom to do what they want to do.  You don't have to buy it.  You don't have to look at it.  You don't have to own it.  But this is a country where you can express yourself.  And look at our music and look at our dance and look at our poetry.  I mean this is how we get the message out.  This is how we express our points of view and the--and the points of view are as diverse as the artist.
Story_ID: 178291
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As a tenacious, determined woman who loved life and loved--that my work and my life are not separated.  That it's all about the art.  It's about the empowerment of artists, the collecting of art, being around art, helping artists.
Story_ID: 178292
Speaker 1: Could you describe this photo for me?
Speaker 2: This was our annual visit to John Wanamaker's in Pennsylvania to see Santa Claus, me and my brother.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your brother's name?
Speaker 2: William H. Murphy, Jr.
Speaker 1: Can you--?  Okay.
Speaker 2: This is a picture with Maurice Rabb, Sr. on my left, me, the young, newly engaged bride to be, my husband [HM] Maurice, Jr., his wife, Jewel Rabb, in Louisville, Kentucky.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And I recognize that piece.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  This piece hangs in my house today.  It's a piece that I got in Trinidad.  I'd gone on a trip with Urban Gateways to Trinidad and spied this piece and bought it.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the artist?
Speaker 2: The artist is on the right.  I don't remember his name.
Speaker 1: All right.  And you ready?
Speaker 2: This is my grandmother, Moj [ph.] Madeline Wheeler, my mother's mother.  I adored this woman.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's one of my press pictures for my jewelry, Nineteen--2002, I think.
Speaker 1: All right.  Ready?
Speaker 2: And this is a picture of my mother on the left, Madeline Wheeler Murphy and my father, William H. Murphy and me.
Speaker 1: And what was the occasion?
Speaker 2: I think we were at a fundraiser, probably, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is about seven, eight years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In the Nineties.  And this is our engagement picture, Maurice and me, 1965 probably.
Speaker 1: And was that printed in the (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yes it was. Yes it was.  This is a picture with my two best friends, my sister [HM] Laura Murphy on the left, my mother Madeline Murphy in the middle and Madeline Rabb on the right.  This was taken in Chicago [Illinois].  She had come to visit.  Laura was living in Chicago at the time so we decided to have our picture made.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And when was that done?
Speaker 2: Let's see, it's about fourteen years ago.  And that is a picture of me with my first born grandson, Freeman Dialo [ph.] Perry Rabb.  That was this summer.
Speaker 1: And --
Speaker 2: And that's a good picture too there.
Speaker 1: Top right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Oh.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  This is a picture of--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, there's Sister Constance.
Speaker 2: Yeah, of my aunt Marianne [ph.], my mother's sister on the lower left, [HM] Sister Constance [Murphy], my eldest and only living aunt, paternal aunt, my mother Madeline on the right, Arthur Murphy, Bill Pacelis [phonetic], my sister's fiance, [HM] Laura Murphy, Teresa Briscoll, Billy's girlfriend, Billy Murphy, my brother, Maurice Rabb, Madeline Rabb and Houston Murphy, my siblings.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This was at our father's memorial service in March.
Speaker 1: Of 2003.
Speaker 2: 2003.
Speaker 1: Ready?
Speaker 2: Dialo [ph.], Freeman Dialo, me and Maurice, my husband.
Speaker 1: That was the summer of 1965 when I had escaped to Presbyterian conference grounds to work that summer.  I was working in the office.
Speaker 2: All right.  And ready?
Speaker 1: That's a picture of me with Christopher and Maurice on a beach somewhere, probably Jamaica in the early '70s [1970s].  Probably about '78 [1978].
Speaker 2: Okay, tell us about this.
Speaker 1: That's my mug shot from the University of Maryland [College, Maryland].
Speaker 2: (Unclear)?
Speaker 1: Um-um.
Speaker 2: So what--
Speaker 1: 5'3, 116 pounds.
Speaker 2: I always thought you were taller--
Speaker 1: It's Christopher in the foreground--I mean Maurice in the foreground and Christopher in the middle and me on Lake Shore--on the beach or on the walkway, Lake Michigan, Chicago.  And that would be about 1977.  Or no, 1972, '73 [1973].  You know there's another book.  Can I (unclear).  This is a picture that was in Ebony on (unclear).
Speaker 2: (BRIEF PAUSE)
Speaker 1: That's a picture taken in 1996 of my son Maurice on the left, me, my husband and son Christopher Rabb.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that's a picture in my old days at the Cultural [Chicago Cultural Center]--at Daley Plaza.  We used to have events at Daily Plaza and this is Savion Glover and Earl Hines--
Speaker 2: Gregory.
Speaker 1: Gregory Hines.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --back in the old days.
Speaker 1: And this was an event at the Cultural Center with Harold Washington Studs Terkel [Louis Studs Terkel] and Gwendolyn Brooks and me.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And this is one I particularly love.  This was Harold Washington and me at the Cultural Center looking at a picture by [James] Van Der Zee in 1984.
Speaker 2: As part of the five black photographers?
Speaker 1: Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: All right.  Go ahead.
Speaker 1: And this is PS40--School 49, 1958, ninth grade [Baltimore, Maryland].  And there I am in the fourth from the right.
Speaker 2: On which row?
Speaker 1: First row.
Speaker 2: First row?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In a dress that my mother made.
Speaker 1: Fourth from the right, that would make you--
Speaker 2: From the left.
Speaker 1: From the left.
Speaker 2: Right there.
Speaker 1: Right here, okay.  Oh okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, right at work.  And this is a new studio?
Speaker 1: This is in graduate school at Illinois Institute of Technology [Chicago, Illinois].  I got my degree there in printmaking.
Speaker 2: In--?
Speaker 1: In--I'm working on a print.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And this was in 1983, the first year that I was in the mayor's--in the position with the mayor [Mayor Harold Washington].  My son, Maurice the third on the left, me, Harold Washington, my mother Madeline Murphy, Maurice Rabb my husband, and Christopher Rabb.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And this is a family picture in the early '80s [1980s], my brother Houston, left to right, Houston, Billy, me, Arthur, Laura, William and Madeline Murphy.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is my mother and father.
Speaker 2: Was that a special occasion?
Speaker 1: I think my mother had received an award that day.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And this was an event that I hosted for the Humanities Council for John Hope Franklin.
Speaker 2: I remember that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh do you?  Um-hmm.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: When we had a big house at 48th and Woodlawn we used to have a lot of events and fundraisers and civic and social and cultural events.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that's at my senior prom in a dress made by my dear mother.  It was a pretty dress.  I have to give her credit.  She was a very good, she was very good.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: All righty.
Speaker 2: And that's a picture of my father and me.
Speaker 1: How old were you?
Speaker 2: I must have been about eleven.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, next.  And that's on Cherry Hill [Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: In Cherry Hill.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: And this is a picture of my mother holding Arthur, my brother and I'm on the far right.  This is in Atlantic City [New Jersey].  And that's a picture of me in Cote d'Ivoire, the Ivory Coast and I was buying art for an auction for the DuSable Museum [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Another homemade dress?
Speaker 2: I actually think my mother bought this dress.  This is a dress for my confirmation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's it.
Speaker 1: That was probably 1984.
Speaker 2: And what's the occasion? What's happening?
Speaker 1: I'm briefing the mayor [Mayor Harold Washington] on remarks that he has to make for a cultural event at the [Chicago] Cultural Center.
Speaker 2: And it was good that he was a cultural mayor (unclear)--
