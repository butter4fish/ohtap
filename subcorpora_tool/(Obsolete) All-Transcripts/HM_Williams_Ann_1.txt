Speaker 1: What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food? I guess watermelon.
Speaker 1: Your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Well, it's a tie, between Kauai, Hawaii and Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Your favorite color?

Speaker 1: Your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Summer.
Speaker 1: And your favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I don't know what my favorite saying is. I know that I often use the word "little"  you know? And so I connect that with how I'll call someone, you know? "Little law student?", my "little" law clerks, things like that, but no real favorite phrase.
Story_ID: 20303
Speaker 1: I want to start out by you telling us about your parents. You were born in Detroit [Michigan]. I'd like you to talk about, you know, I'd like you first to talk about your father. Who he was, and his name and what you know about where he was born.
Speaker 2: All right. Well my father's name is Joshua Marcus Williams. He was born October 8, 1916 in Bamberg, South Carolina.  He was the son of a minister. And he has many memories of driving his father around, because his father was a terrible driver. And so my dad began driving for him when he was nine or ten years old. Taking him all around the state, visiting various churches that were in his district.  My dad was very inspirational to me.  He had to--his mother died at an early age, when he was in high school, and he--as I said, drove his dad for quite a while. And he had to work his way through school, his father believed in education. And as a result, my dad was a great believer in education and worked his way through college. He waited tables, he was a painter. He did all kinds of things to earn money to graduate from college. That, of course, was very unusual in the 40s [1940s]. And he actually started college in the late 30s [1930s].  He ultimately graduated from Clark College and Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia].  He moved to Detroit [Michigan] after graduating and well really, after he was in the service. Because he was in the service as a Staff Sergeant.  And he could not find a job in his area. He graduated with a degree in Psychology. Of course, when he moved to Detroit, there were no positions for blacks as psychologists. And after trying a stint at selling insurance, which he was not a good salesman, he did not know how to come in--he did not have the killer instinct.  He applied for a position as a bus driver. And he drove for the Detroit DSR, Detroit Streets & Railways, for almost twenty years.  And I loved the fact that he was a bus driver, because when we would meet him at the end of the line--'cause we had one car, and my mother always worked full time outside the home. I would have an opportunity to get on the bus three or four blocks before the terminal and I could get on the bus and ride with him until the end of the line, which I loved to do. And then we would get to the terminal and at that time, the bus drivers had those change machines. And I loved going into the terminal because he would let me put the money in those little orange and blue round containers for the coins, 'cause everything wasn't automatic then, and I thought that was wonderful. And I would see the men playing dominos in the terminal. And I never thought about the fact that here was my father, psychology degree, driving a bus, until he had had his twenty years in and he had saved enough money and he decided that he wanted to go back to school, because he wanted to teach. And as fate would have it, I was getting my degree in education, so daddy and I were in classes together. Which I thought was really very cool. And I was very excited for him, and never had really thought about the fact that he had that degree and was driving a bus, until we were in school together. And one day in speech class, and you had to give various speeches, and there was one speech you had to give an impromptu speech on who you admired in your life. And I started talking about my father and what he had done. And I actually started crying in the middle of the speech, because it was then brought home to me, what his life must have been like. And I went home that day and I said, "Daddy, how could you stand it? Here you had this degree in education, how could you stand to drive a bus all these years?"  And he said, "I knew what I needed to do for my family".  And it wasn't an issue of what I could stand or not stand. It was an issue of putting bread on the table, and driving that bus was not demeaning in any way.  He said, "I used a lot of psychology with the people on the bus. And I learned a lot about the human condition, driving the bus, and I knew that no one could take my education away from me.  And I was very comfortable with who I was."  And that was a great lesson to me in my life. And my mother had a similar story.
Story_ID: 20304
Speaker 1: My mother had a similar story. My mother was born April 6, 1924. She was born in Spartanburg, South Carolina. And similar kind of background, except her mother was a nurse, so her mother had education. As I said we were very blessed and fortunate that that was on both sides of my family, so my mother also worked her way through college and she was in college during the war [World War II]. One of the places she worked was one of the service clubs. She graduated with a degree in Education from North Carolina A&T [Agrigultural and Techinical State University, Greensboro, N. Carolina.] Moved to Detroit [Michigan], wanted to get a job as a teacher. Her degree was in Home Economics, but blacks were not being given contracts to teach at that time, permanent positions. You could get hired as a substitute teacher. She didn't want to do that. We only had one car, they both had to get to work. She needed to have a place certain that she worked. And so she worked for ten years in a training school for delinquent children. And after ten years, blacks could get contracts and be in permanent positions in the Detroit School System and so she taught school.  And you know, I think about them and I really began to think about them a lot, as I was in college and in getting my Masters and going to law school and the various things I've done in my life. And whenever I felt discouraged, you know, I thought about their stories. And I thought about daddy and that bus twenty years and mom, at that training school for ten years and I figured anything that would happen to me would pale by comparison. And if they could do what they had achieved in their lifetime, then there were really no limits on what I could do. And so they have served to be a great inspiration to me.
Story_ID: 20305
Speaker 1: They were both from South Carolina?
Speaker 2: Both from South Carolina.
Speaker 1: But they met, where did they meet?
Speaker 2: They met in Detroit. Because my father is eight years older than my mother, so he actually knew her older brother in Spartanburg [South Carolina] and he liked to say, he met her when she was holding on to her mother's apron. And, so they had nothing to do with each other then. And then when he moved to Detroit [Michigan] and she moved to Detroit, the families reconnected and that's how they met again.
Story_ID: 20306
Speaker 1: Now did they ever, do you know much about your grandparents? About how far, let's see--do you know much about them at all? Or your family back history?
Speaker 2: Daddy [Joshua] doesn't know much about his history. Mainly, he just knows about his father. I know that if you go back about three generations, he comes from slaves--well we all come from slaves at some point. And similarly on my mother's side. But I don't know a lot about the background of the family.
Story_ID: 20307
Speaker 1: First of all, tell us about your other siblings, just real briefly.
Speaker 2: All right, well I have a sister, Marsha [ph.] Williams and she has a degree, she's a nurse. She has a B.S.N. [ Bachelor of Science Nursing] degree. And then my youngest sister is an actor. And graduated from Michigan State [University,East Lansing, Michigan], theater was her major. And she's in New York, a struggling actress in her first major off-Broadway production this fall. And that picture I have of her on that top shelf is when she was in 'Raisin In The Sun', starring in the role of Beneatha [Younger]. Her name was Drew, Margaret Drew Williams.
Story_ID: 20308
Speaker 1: Can you share just some memories, you know, some of your favorite memories growing up.
Speaker 2: Well, I remember my mother my mother loved to read, and loved to read to us. And I have a very clear memory of that. And I remember a blizzard in the 60s [1960s], the first major terrible snowstorm, and I want to say it was around '66 or '67 [1966-1967]. It hit Chicago too [January 1967 Blizzard]. And school cancelled for two or three days, and there were, at least, two or three feet of snow outside. And I can remember that we sat by the fire, cause we had a fireplace in the living room. And my mother read 'Old Yeller', and we all took turns reading that book by the fire, and roasting marshmallows in the fire. And I remember that as a strong memory, reading. Then my family, I would say, probably around the time I entered high school, began to go camping. My parents bought a pop-up trailer, and we had gone to the World's Fair in 1964 [New York World's Fair], which was a major vacation for us, and it was expensive. And we were with my grandmother and my uncle and we were in our station wagon and that was a wonderful trip. But I can remember my mother, wanting us to go to the World's Fair in Toronto [1967 Montreal, Canada Exposition], and she talked to a coworker, and that coworker was talking about various trips they took and it turned out they camped. And of course, it's much more economical to camp. So we bought a pop-up trailer and I have lots of great memories of trips we took in that trailer. So we did go to the World's Fair in Toronto or in Montr--no it was in Toronto. And then, or was it--
Speaker 1: It was in Montreal
Speaker 2: In Montreal. Okay. And then after we did the World's Fair, we had a campsite in Canada, just across the border about an hour from home that we went up many weekends and all through college and even law school, my parents camped. And so I have great memories of us singing around the campfire, telling stories. My father loved croquet and my mother too, and I can remember them playing croquet. The other big memory I have is, all the family holidays that the family got together. My grandmother had six children, three boys and three girls. And all but one married and had kids. And all the major holidays we were together and I remember Memorial Day, Fourth of July, and Labor Day, we would get up about 4 or 4:30 in the morning and go to one of the beautiful parks in the suburban areas. And you know it was a first come-first serve basis, so we'd get up really early and I would go with my cousin and her family that we saw on a regular--we saw them just about every weekend. And we would go save the site and we would get a big site with four or five picnic tables and have everything ready. And then the rest of the family would eventually come and everybody would get there by noon. And we did that for every holiday. And then every Christmas, we were at my grandmother's for Christmas dinner. And I have very clear memories of that. When my grandmother became ill and couldn't live alone, she moved to our house and my mother started the Christmas dinners. And she's had the Christmas dinner now for so many years, I cannot count them and I have never missed Christmas dinner at home in Detroit.
Story_ID: 20309
Speaker 1: So the Christmas dinner was so important to the family, that I've never missed Christmas dinner my entire life. So that means we have to pack up all the gifts, get everybody together and drive over to Detroit. We've gone there through all kinds of weather. Blizzards, ice storms, so that we could be with the family. And be there Christmas Eve, and be there for the Christmas dinner, because I wanted my children to have that bond with the family, and to not see the family just at funeral time. And I think that's very important. And as I have such strong memories that will remain with me forever. You asked me other memories growing up-- I mentioned my cousin Reneé and her family, because my parents always played bridge. They both learned in college and her parents played bridge. And so every weekend we were at one house or the other. And she's very close in age to me and then she has a younger brother, who is the same age or right around between the age of my two sisters. And so we were all very close. And I remember all those times. And I remember music, singing, because my father had a wonderful singing voice. And so I took piano from the age of eight and the other memory I have is all the piano recitals that my parents and relatives attended, because all the cousins who were my generation had to take piano. And singing around the piano at Christmas time and various times.
Story_ID: 20310
Speaker 1: So obviously family is important to you. What kind of family would you say? I mean, you know, characterize them. I'm sure you stayed close but what kind of family unit did you have?
Speaker 2: We had an intact family unit. Because I had, I was fortunate and blessed enough to have a father and a mother, both of whom worked outside the home, both who believed in education. Both who had a strong spiritual base, and both who were very aware of current events and current affairs and we had dinner--we sat down and had dinner together every night and we used to have great discussions. Sometimes about just what went on at school or what was going on in our lives. But often about what was going on in the world, what was going on in this country. And of course, having grown up in the '60s [1960s] , with the Civil Rights Movement, and my parents having experienced segregation and lived through segregation, having gone to segregated schools in the South. I can remember one trip we took to the South. And it was at a time when basically, you would not stop, you would drive non-stop to Florida. Visiting again, my cousin Renee's grandmother and there were no stops on the trip, because blacks couldn't go to the hotels and you were afraid to stop in the little towns. And you would basically gas up and go straight and drive all night to get to whatever your destination was. So we talked about, you know, we just talked about the whole civil rights movement a lot. You know, we saw and followed Rosa Parks and [Rev.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] and we talked about those things at the dinner table. So I found that very stimulating. And so it was a great environment, a great family environment.
Story_ID: 20311
Speaker 1: Now Detroit [Michigan], what was it like at that point? Detroit was really sort of happening there in the '60s [1960s]. You had Motown and I just want you to sort of describe, you know, the community that you sort of grew up with.
Speaker 2: Well, Motown [Record Company, Detroit, Michigan] was probably fifteen or twenty blocks from my house. And that was very exciting, because Stevie Wonder [musical artist] and Marvin Gaye  and Tammy Terrell, the Temptations and the Supremes  were very much a part of our lives. And so it was an exciting time in Detroit. And Detroit at that time was a very vibrant city and I can remember when Dr. Martin Luther King [Jr.] came to Detroit and we went to hear him. And it was, I guess, a year or two before he was shot and killed. And what an inspiration he was to us. And I was involved a lot in high school. I was involved in the Human Relations Council and traveled to various high schools to talk about issues relating to integration and the council was an integrated panel of high school students and we would talk about racial issues. I went to Wayne State University [Detroit, Michigan]. I stayed at home. Both of my sisters were in private school, Catholic school and I didn't want--I didn't think the family could afford for me to go away to school and so I decided to go to Wayne State and I basically worked my way through school as a cashier with Farmer Jacks for a couple of years and then when I had enough hours, as a substitute teacher. So I was a substitute teacher for two years in the public schools, while I was finishing up. And got my degree in education, started out really in music. That was my original major 'cause I took--I had taken piano lessons since the age of eight and started voice lessons at twelve or thirteen. I really wanted to do that. But, when I got to Wayne [State University], I was competing against a lot of kids who had gone through music programs for four years. I had gone to a Catholic school and I had been in the choir, I played for the choir, but didn't have that kind of background. And when I got to college was discouraged by that. And so switched majors to elementary education. But when I substitute taught, because I could play the piano, I always got the position as a sub [substitute] in the music room, and I really loved that more. So I didn't sign a contract when I graduated. And I would take these long-term music assignments when women would go on maternity leave. And finally the third year I was teaching, I couldn't get a music assignment. I had been evaluated, they thought I was a great music teacher, but I didn't have the certification and I didn't want to go back to school and stop working. So I got the degree in education and after the two years of teaching, realized that I didn't want to teach elementary education. I was getting my Masters degree in those two years after I graduated as well, because I got my masters from the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor. Michigan] in guidance and counseling. And I felt that I could make a difference in children's lives in a role as a counselor and so I taught at the inner city schools of Detroit when I was substitute teaching and in these permanent positions.
Story_ID: 20312
Speaker 1: And when I was getting my masters, a good friend of mine, who was getting his masters in social work, asked me what I was going to do. And we were talking, he stopped by the house one day, and he said, "You know, I'm thinking about going to law school". And it had never entered my mind, but I said, "So am I."  And he said, "You know, we need to take a test." And I said, "You're kidding!" And he said, "No, I'm not kidding."  And he said, "I'll get the forms."  So he got the forms for the LSAT [Law School Admissions Test]. I filled out the forms. We sat for the test like in April, March or April, really late. I was thinking I could get in, in September. Because I had no anxiety I think, and was very lucky I did well on the test, I applied to all these law schools for the fall class, and of course, they were filled. And they said, see us next year. I applied to places like Harvard, and Michigan and various places, Notre Dame. And got rejection letters because I was so late and then about a month before school started at Notre Dame [University, South Bend, Indiana], I got a phone call saying that someone in the class had cancelled and would I be interested in the position?  A good friend of mine who had gone to Wayne [State University, Detroit, Michigan] with me, had been admitted to Notre Dame, knew I had applied, and so, was very helpful in putting my name forward. Because he knew I had applied to school, but there were no positions and then this opening happened, and that's how I ended up going to Notre Dame. And when I got the offer, I debated whether I should go then, because at that point I was ready to go back to teach. Make more money, be in a better position to actually go to law school. And I thought about it for a few days whether to take that offer or not and ultimately decided it was a good thing and that I should go to Notre Dame when I had this opportunity. And that's how I started law school.
Story_ID: 20313
Speaker 1: Now I want to take you back a few years. And just ask, back to maybe between let's say elementary and junior high. What was the young Ann Williams like? Was she shy? Was she mischievous? Was she, you know, mannerly? What was she like?
Speaker 2: Well, she was definitely shy. More on the--what I think the kids would now say, the geek kind of side. I had always done very well in school. My mother and father have described me as sort of a very self-sufficient person, because I could sit down with a book. I love to read, I still love to read. I could sit down with a book and--or with blocks or with the piano or anything and I could just entertain myself and my parents say that I was like that from when I was born. And it wasn't that I wasn't social, it was just that I could be very entertained by myself. But I was--I was pretty shy. I was very active in different things in school, because I was in the Glee Club and I was in the All-City Choir for the schools. I was on the newspaper. I mean, I was quite involved in a lot of activities. But I was not someone who was like, say real popular or had tons of friends or anything like that. I was really on the quiet side. I know people find that hard to believe now, but I was.
Story_ID: 20314
Speaker 1: Now also, what were your sort of dreams? You know, as a child, we all had dreams or thoughts and did you ever think about what you wanted to be or did you ever sort of fantasize about anything?
Speaker 2: Well, I really wanted to be a singer. That's what I really wanted to be. And I really didn't think about law, that wasn't in the picture. It was all music--and a teacher. Now both my parents have been teachers and when I expressed an interest in being a teacher. Which was from a very young age, because even in high school, I volunteered and worked with elementary school kids after school. In high school, the jobs I had were like camp counselor to kids. I always saw myself in a career dealing with children and also dealing with music and I didn't know which way. I mean--and I think my parents, even though they thought teaching was a great profession, felt that there were more opportunities out there for me. But even at the time I graduated from undergrad [undergraduate school], most of my friends were majoring in education, social work or they went to nursing school, or maybe major in humanities or something of that kind. I did pledge a sorority, Delta Sigma Theta in my junior year of college, and that was really a good experience for me and got me to be more social. But even in the sorority setting, you know, I can remember the first woman who decided she was going to go to medical school, as part--who was in the sorority and that was very exciting for all of us. And I remember the first one who went to law school. So women were just beginning at that time to go into other--I mean there were other women that obviously had become lawyers and doctors. But I mean my peers, were just beginning to explore as I graduated from undergrad, other options beyond the teaching, social work, nursing sort of sphere.
Story_ID: 20315
Speaker 1: Now I want to go back and talk about music. What appeals to you about music? What--or about singing? What--how did it make you feel or what appealed to you?
Speaker 2: Well you just get--you get lost in the beauty of the music, and you get beyond who you are. And you get almost in a zone with music. And it's very special and it's very very personal. And there's room for so much as an individual, so that you can, you know, and I always liked all kinds of music. One of the frustrations I had in music, was I was classically trained on the piano and in voice. And I wanted to sing jazz! And I wanted to do like popular tunes. And you know at that time, when you went to parties, and things, a lot of people had pianos in their houses and you know, they knew I played and you know, wanted me to play some Motown tune or something. Well, I could read the music and play it, but I wanted to really play like that! And I couldn't get that at Wayne State [University, Detroit, Michigan] you know? And at the time when I switched majors, I was in the opera workshop. I was in the women's glee club, and you know we did spirituals and things like that. But I really wanted more jazz and that was not considered--didn't have the kind of stature that it has now. But anyway, I just loved the music. I loved being --getting lost in the music and whenever I was frustrated or angry or mad, or there was some big issue in my life, I would always play the piano. And it was a way to get that frustration out as well. And I always felt better after I played or after I was singing. So it's meant a lot to me in my life. And then, of course, once I had kids, I played for them and all the nursery songs and all the songs I had learned as a teacher. I knew all those kid songs and so I played those with my kids. And one year I sent music tapes to my dad, with all of singing Christmas carols. And so it's been a big part of my life.
Story_ID: 20316
Speaker 1: Tell me what are some of your favorite songs or what is your favorite song?
Speaker 2: Well there are a lot of songs that I really like. I don't know what I can say my favorite song is, but I love Aretha Franklin's natural woman--'You make me feel like a natural woman'. I really like that song.
Story_ID: 20317
Speaker 1: You know, you were saying that you were a substitute. Was it different? Did you, you were teaching in the inner city schools.
Speaker 2: Right. Well, I knew how we had treated substitute teachers, and I knew I was not going to be treated like that. So, I developed a whole routine and being in music was a great place to sub, because if you could play the piano and you could sing, that would really help carry the day. But I had a whole routine where I would stand in the door and I would let the kids all come in and of course, they would all be loud and raising 'h' [hell], because they knew that I was a sub. And I would wait and the bell would ring and I would just stand at the door and then turn around and look at the kids. Well eventually, the kids wondered what was going on. And they would always quiet down. And I would wait until there was total quiet and I would say, "I am Miss Williams and I will be here until the end of the day.  So if there's anyone here that would like to leave, they can do that right now. But I have certain rules in this classroom and you will listen and you will pay attention. Now is there anyone that wants to leave?"  And usually, that was enough to get them. And so they were trying to figure out what's the deal with this Miss Williams? Well, and then I would say, "Now are there any songs that you can take out your book and this is day where--are there any songs you like to sing that are in the book? You just let me know. You raise your hand and I'll write it down.  I'd write the page numbers down. Because they wondered you know, can she play it? Whatever, I knew all the songs in the book and I would sit down and once I would start playing, you could hear the kids whispering, "Oh she can play. She can play!  And then I always taught them two or three songs you know, or taught a song in the middle and then I would have to sing it and they would have to follow and then they would be so excited. "Oh she can sing. She can sing!  Then, I would watch the kids after that first class and they would race out of the classroom, talking about this Miss Williams. And then I did the same thing every period. So, you know, you had to do something to psyche the kids out when you were a sub, because everybody knew they could be on their worst behavior with a sub. So I enjoyed subbing a lot, because I enjoyed that with the kids. And it also gave me an opportunity to go to so many different schools and get a sense of what a well run school was and what was not a well run school and where I might ultimately like to end up. So that was another reason I didn't want to sign a contract. Cause I didn't want to get stuck in a school that I didn't want to be in. And ultimately when I did move to a full time assignment, out of the music room, I was invited to that school by a principal who had had me as a substitute in another school. So it was a great experience and I enjoyed working with the kids. I enjoyed seeing the light bulb go off. I enjoyed putting on programs. I was always a believer and still am, that the kids could perform at a much higher level than some had expectations of. Because I believe if you aim high, you'll get there. And so when we did programs, the kids memorized all the words, you know? I didn't take any crap off the kids, they knew that. I wanted a professional performance, they had their eyes on me. They were quiet when they were supposed to be quiet. Because I felt that our kids could perform at the highest level, and so I felt that if you had the expectation and you were willing to put the time in, then the kids could perform. I remember one recital in particular, we were celebrating [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] Day and one of the kids had memorized 'I Have A Dream' speech, and he did that whole speech by heart. And you know, we would have poetry and various things like that. And it was a wonderful experience and I still love kids today. And as a judge, bringing a lot of school children to my courtroom. When I was on district court, I had kids in all the time; giving them tours, having them play the role of witness or court bailiff or whatever. And so I really love teaching and I still teach. I teach lawyers now how to try cases. But I still teach when I bring in groups of young adults and children.
Story_ID: 20318
Speaker 1: How did you know how to do that? You sound like
Speaker 2: When I was--
Speaker 1: (inaudible?)
Speaker 2: --well, I graduated from high school at sixteen, so I was subbing [substituting] probably at nineteen. I was subbing at nineteen, but I came from a family of teachers and I had always done--I have always been in choirs and things like that, so I knew what needed to be done. And I always loved words and so, I don't know when I started changing the lyrics to words, but I think it was probably when I was substitute teaching and so I would make up songs. Songs to fit a particular occasion or take a popular song and change the words and I did that when I pledged as a sorority. So, we had all these great pledge songs that were based on popular music and Motown music that we would change the words to. So I don't know, I guess maybe just my parents and the fact that I had been involved in kids and day camp, you know, because I had been a camp counselor. And then I, I don't know, I guess I just took to it.
Story_ID: 20319
Speaker 1: What about, tell me Ann, is there something I mean you haven't really said this, but is it something about that child's mind that you like and that you find very nimble or whatever? I mean something-- remember you were saying how seeing their eyes flash--
Speaker 2: Light up yeah--seeing the light bulb go off. Seeing either the kids get it when you teach something and they really get it and they really understand, and to see the joy that they feel, because they have mastered something. I love that feeling of you know, when we had those concerts at school and the pride that the kids took, and how good they felt about themselves and knowing that they could do a first class--first rate performance. And seeing how much they enjoyed, you know, the music. And even when I taught in the homeroom, when I was teaching reading, writing and math, you know, to see a kid stand up, who had had trouble reading. You know, all year and to see them stand up and read a story straight through 'cause it finally clicked that they got the phonics, that it all made sense. You know, that makes you feel like you're making a difference in somebody's lives. And that's with the teaching, each child is an individual and you can experience, you can have that experience, day after day with different children. That's what I think you know, causes people to stay in education. And some of my friends that I started out with, that were in the sorority with me, have remained teachers, and continue to be thrilled by seeing that. And so, that's what I love seeing and feeling. The other thing is you do feel good as a teacher, cause you feel like you've made a difference in somebody's life. Like maybe you've inspired them and maybe it will make their life a little better. My parents were big believers in recognizing the blessings we have been given. Like their education and the fact that they had good jobs. And they also felt that we had a very serious obligation to give something back to the community. That we were compelled to, that we were forced to, that we were obligated to make sure that the road would be better for someone else. And so the various discussions we had, because we talked about slavery quite a bit, and the civil rights movement and all the things that had happened to blacks, since blacks came to this country. And you know, that we are here because we stand on the backs of all those who have gone before us. If Harriet Tubman [escaped slave who led other slaves along the Underground Railroad] hadn't done what she had done, if all the various slaves hadn't died in the way they did, or worked in the way they did, you know, we wouldn't be where we are today. And so, I feel that very strong sense of, I need to give something back to the community. And so as a teacher you really feel like you are passing on the lessons and making the way better for someone else.

Speaker 1: Now was there something about teaching that, I mean you say that this friend came and he was talking to you and you said sure. Do you think at that point in your life, you had not reached your full potential or there was something more--
Speaker 2: At that time, that I applied to law school, I also applied to be a counselor with the schools, because I was getting my masters in guidance and counseling. I had definitely decided that counseling was where I wanted to go. That it was very important that kids at the elementary level have counseling. At that time, it was pretty much accepted in education that you had counseling at the high school level, but based on the experience I had had in the elementary schools, I thought that counselors were very needed in the elementary schools and there was money, federal money for experimental programs for counseling at the elementary level. So I had applied for a position there. I had applied for a position at Wayne State [University, Detroit, Michigan] as a college counselor. I had applied for a position with the [Wayne] County [Michigan] as a drug counselor. And I applied for a position at Burroughs [Corporation], which was comparable to like the old IBM [International Business Machines], well now I guess IBM is the new IBM, but that was like a human resource kind of person [Burroughs Corporation became Unisys in 1986]. And then I applied to law school. But you're right, I realized that there was something more that I wanted to do. And law school actually came through first, before all these things. In fact, I got the job as a drug counselor while I was in my second month at law school. But I did apply to law school on a whim. I really did apply on a whim, almost like a dare. But as I thought about it more and more, I thought that I might really enjoy law school and that it might be a good fit because of course, lawyers teach and lawyers counsel. And that was my background. And I also felt that lawyers could make a difference--a difference in the world, and maybe have a different kind of impact on society, and on--a different kind of impact on society and could change things in a systemic way. Rather than one child at a time sort of, maybe have a broader impact. So and of course, I wanted to be a defense attorney, like Perry Mason [popular tv show of the 1950s-1960s]. There were no lawyers in my family. I really didn't know any lawyers. I had one very good girlfriend who was in law school in Texas and then one very dear friend from high school whose husband was in law school at [University of] Notre Dame [South Bend, Indiana], but I had never gone to classes with them, even though I had visited them on their campuses. But when I started thinking about law and what lawyers did, I thought that it might be a good fit and I wanted to be a trial lawyer. And of course, teachers stand up and talk. And teachers have to persuade and that's what lawyers have to do. So I, you know, after all was said and done, I felt it was the right thing to do.
Story_ID: 20321
Speaker 1: Favorite teachers? I loved my library teacher, Mrs. Bryan, and because she was such a great storyteller. And once a week, she would get in her rocker and she would read to the class and she was very dramatic. And then I remember once, I stayed after school to help her and I got a ride in her pink Thunderbird  convertible and that was the best! So I remember her very well. And I remember Dr. Cross, really my fifth and sixth grade teachers were the most influential and then my music teacher, I remember, although her name escapes me now. So I would say those and Dr. Radcliff was another teacher, because he I think I worked on the school newspaper in his room. So, I would say those four teachers really made a difference in my life.
Story_ID: 20322
Speaker 1: Okay, you've gotten accepted to the University of Notre Dame Law School [South Bend, Indiana], and really this is the first time you're away, out of Detroit [Michigan] . And it's a much different environment. And I was just wondering, law school can be really all consuming, at times, but what was that experience like?
Speaker 2: Well as you said, even for my masters I was going to Rackham Extension [School of the University of Michigan, Detroit, Michigan] which was in Detroit and all I had to do was in the summers, for two summers, I commuted to [University of Michigan] Ann Arbor to take the classes I needed. So I was still at home. But when I--I will never forget the day that--well since I got accepted late, I missed the CLEO [Council on Legal Education Opportunity] program, which was a good program that was designed for minorities to be successful in law school and I missed that program all together. So, my parents packed up--we packed up the U-Haul and drove up to Notre Dame and my sisters were there and my parents were there. I had never been away from home. And so, as they were getting ready, we were saying goodbye. I just cried like a baby, I'm a big crier. And so, it was very traumatic for me! You know, although I was very excited about being away, but I was, of course, brought right back to reality. I got into my room and I called my friend, who had been at Wayne with me, Willie [G.] Lipscomb [Jr.], he's now a judge, a very prominent judge in Detroit, and I said, "Oh, I'm here", you know and school starts tomorrow, and his question to me was, "Have you done the readings?"  "What readings?" I said, "You know, school starts tomorrow." We'll get the syllabus and we'll get, cause you know, an undergrad and graduate school you went to school the first day and you got the syllabus, that was it. He said, "Oh no. There are assignments."  And I had to get in my Volkswagen and drive over to his house and read those cases. I didn't even have the books! And that's how I started law school. So, it was very different from anything I had expected or I had anticipated. And as I said having no lawyers, you know, in the family, and no idea what it was going to be like, that was kind of a rude awakening. And so that's how I began my first day at law school.
Story_ID: 20323
Speaker 1: So how did you find that whole law school experience? I have some experience. I just sort of moseyed over to the book store thinking, "Oh I'll buy my books and everyone is rushing around and--and you have to be here and there." And oh, it was like being in a washing machine!
Speaker 2: I know. It was tough. And it was different too, because at that time, of course, there were fewer women. I think there were maybe twenty women in my class, which was really quite a few women out of 120. There was certainly more women in my class than the classes that preceded. And there were seven African Americans, and a couple people of Hispanic origin in our class of 120. And you know, even though I come from Wayne State [University,Detroit Michigan], that had an enrollment of I don't know, 35 thousand it had a pretty significant minority population. That first year I lived in graduate housing. And so I got acclimated to the campus and [University of] Notre Dame [South Bend, Indiana] and the whole mystique of Notre Dame. And the second and third year I was fortunate enough to get a position as an assistant rector, and assistant dorm director, so I really got into life at Notre Dame, because I had these young women who lived in Farley Hall and so that really gave me an eye into the campus and so ultimately, the experience I had at Notre Dame was very positive. Once I got used to it, once I got used to the environment. It was a great academic setting, and I made lifelong friends there. And I've had a lifelong connection with the university. So, at different points, I thought well what would have happened if I had gone to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], or if I had gone to University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan]? Would my life be different? And of course, you never know, but I'm a firm believer in everything happens for a reasons. And sort of God has the master plan and we don't always know what the plan is, but things happen and you know, doors close, so that other doors are going to open. And so I think it was the right thing for me to do to go to Notre Dame. I've never regretted it. It was a great experience all in all.
Story_ID: 20324
Speaker 1: The question that I have is that you had been trained in music and also as an educator and then a counselor. But how did this experience differ and what things did you learn, during those three years. You obviously had to learn how to think and talk like a lawyer?
Speaker 2: Right and that was the hardest. Thinking and talking like a lawyer. Because the whole human side of the picture, I had that down. I found it to actually be an advantage and I would say that in terms of the African Americans in my class, and really I think the two Hispanic guys, we all had other careers before. And I think that was a tremendous advantage that we had. So yes, I had to learn the legal jargon. I had to learn to think like a lawyer, and that was not easy. That was a struggle. But the plus side was having had life experience. You know, I think there was a maturity there and so, I was able to apply the law to real life experiences and understand the impact that it would have on real people.
Story_ID: 20325
Speaker 1: How do you think that Ann Williams, who entered Chicago [Illinois], is different from the Ann Williams who graduated?
Speaker 2: Well, I would say, you know, that when I went in law school, I was very naive in the sense that--not naive, but didn't really understand even though I knew lawyers could have an impact--really didn't understand all the ramifications of that. And really, how much lawyers are intertwined in society, and how many opportunities there are for lawyers in the various areas of practice. I mean I just had no idea when I entered law school and I had a much better understanding of the law and its impact and areas of practice than I had when I entered law school. And then I thought and I talked like a lawyer, at least I felt I did. And I knew that I was very interested in litigation. Because I went in interested in litigation. I loved trial advocacy. I loved moot court [law school students engage in a mock trial.] And the evidence trial-related type classes and criminal law. So, I just think I was a lot more sophisticated when I was done with the three years.
Story_ID: 20326
Speaker 1: What did you do? Where did you work after your first and second --
Speaker 2: After my first year, I worked in an Upward Bound [college prep program for low-income students] program in South Bend and we had a dorm on campus. I ran the women's side. And these were kids who, bright high school kids, who had been identified as having college potential and lived on campus. And so I loved that job. It was a great job working with the kids. And then my second year, I worked in a law firm in Savannah, Georgia, doing all kinds of work: criminal, civil, civil rights work. And I did that for a year and then when I graduated from law school, I clerked on the 7th circuit [district court, Chicago, Illinois] and that was a wonderful experience. And in terms of inspiration, you know, the judge I worked for, Bob Sprecher, had a big impact on my life as well as Judge [Luther M.] Swygert, who both served on the 7th circuit [district court.] So I really started my career right back where I am today, on the twenty-sixth floor.  How does that feel?
Speaker 1: That feels really good. I really feel blessed. I am just amazed that I would start as a law clerk on twenty-sixth [floor] and then go to the U.S. Supreme on fifteenth [floor], then move to the district court on nineteenth [floor] and then back on twenty-sixth [floor]. So I think my judges, Judge [Robert Arthur] Sprecher and Judge [Luther M.] Swygert would be very happy. But it's very humbling, but it's also very awesome that I would be here, because I never would have predicted this ever in my wildest dreams. You know, just to be on the [7th circuit] district court, cause the odds are so--the odds are so great. 'Cause it's a wonderful job, the district court judge job is a wonderful job. There are over 680 district court positions that is active positions. And you know, one out of 680, and there are probably 200-300 female judges. Now on the Court of Appeals, there are I think, about 180 positions over the whole country. There are eleven spots on this circuit, six of those spots are Illinois spots and I have one of those spots. That to me is pretty amazing. So I've been very blessed in my career, had a number of great opportunities and like to believe that I had the ability to take advantage of those opportunities, and had been preparing myself for these positions all along, but didn't know it. Because it wasn't like I started out, when I was clerking saying, "Oh, I want to be a judge. I never really thought about being a judge.
Story_ID: 20327
Speaker 1: Now, when you, when you got the clerkship, a lot of people--what attracted you to the clerkship?
Speaker 2: The fact that I could work closely with the  judge. The type of work that you do here on a circuit court, it's important work. It's work that makes a difference. The fact that you could really improve your writing skills, and also it's the kind of credential that allows you to have other doors open. And I encourage people every day to apply for federal clerkships and clerkships with state court judges, because working for a judge and a good judge in the legal system means something. And is a real benefit when you apply for a position in a law firm, or with a public agency or wherever. So it's a great position to have.  You clerked for one year?  I clerked for one year.  And then what was the decision after that? I mean you decided--were you at a crossroads at that point? Or did you have it sort of mapped out?
Speaker 1: Well I knew that I wanted to do trial work, and originally, as I mentioned, I wanted to be a defense attorney, and had applied, really applied to the Federal Defender's program here. And applied to the U.S. Attorney's office. Ended up applying at the U.S. Attorney's Office because a woman who was on the staff, sat down and talked to me about how important and significant it was to have representation of all groups in the U.S. Attorney's office, because in that position, you're actually screening cases. You're actually trying to determine if the agents have acted properly. If there's enough evidence and so it's very important to have people who want to do the right thing who are in the prosecutor's office. And after she and I had that conversation, and I thought about it, I realized that that was something that I was interested in. So I applied to the U.S. Attorney's office as well, and got a position in the U.S. Attorney's office.
Story_ID: 20328
Speaker 1: Here you are, a young woman, was it a different experience, you know, clerking and then working for the U.S. Attorney's Office? What, you know, obviously you liked your clerkship experience. You may have come out with ideas about, if you were a trial lawyer, how you would handle things. But I'm just wondering what, you know, what you learned in that experience?
Speaker 2: Well, I learned that that what I wanted to be, which was a trial lawyer, which was something I really enjoyed doing, trying cases. And I loved being in front of a jury, examining witnesses. I mean the thrill of litigation and being there in front of twelve people in the box, is a very exciting experience, if you love that. I mean there are some lawyers who, the last thing they want to do is go in court. But I think my background as a teacher, as a counselor, and the love I have for people, made the trial work something that I really thought was fun and interesting and it was also important work in the U.S. Attorney's Office. So I felt I learned a lot in that position. I learned a lot.
Story_ID: 20329
Speaker 1: And you, what, what division did you work for?
Speaker 2: I started out in the Public Protection Division dealing with consumer fraud and civil rights violations but I was in that for under a year and then I moved to the straight criminal division, Criminal Receiving & Appellate, where I handled appeals for cases that had been tried and won in the office. And then I had small trials that I handled and then you handle what's called "Duty Days", where the agents walk in and you handle whatever they bring, if it's a search warrant, if it's an arrest, and you pick up cases. I did that for a couple of years and then I moved to the Criminal Litigation Division where you try the major criminal cases. And I tried a lot of cases there. And then I was promoted to deputy chief of the Criminal Receiving and Appellate Division where I got to work with the young lawyers and the teaching instincts all came out. And I, after taking a trial advocacy course, began teaching with the National Institute for Trial Advocacy, teaching at Northwestern Trial Ad Skills and teaching at John Marshall [School of Law, Chicago, Illinois], doing trial programs, which I really enjoyed doing. I really enjoyed doing that. So, and then I was in that position for two years, and then there was a new position created across the country, twelve chiefs of the Organized Crime, Drug Enforcement Task Force and I was the chief in this North Central Region, which involved five states: Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Iowa, and but anyway, five U.S. Attorneys. And we were putting together an organizational framework, whereby, prosecutors and agents in that five state region could exchange information on large drug trafficking organizations. And extra money was put into the program to investigate from various points of view. So you would have the IRS [Internal Revenue Service]  involved. They would play the tax angle. You might have INS [Immigration and Naturalization Services] involved. You might have the DEA [Drug Enforcement Agency], the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] and the other part of it was to get the various law enforcement agencies to work together to investigate these organizations. So I did that and I also had to report to Washington, to the chief of the Criminal Division. And that was a position that initially I did not want this position in the drug task force, because I had spent some time handling drug prosecutions and felt I had done my time there. But this position came in the U.S. Attorney's Office, the U.S. Attorney asked me to consider the position and I did, I took the position and it turned out to be a great decision. Because that position, I was able to get lots of exposure in that position from Washington, from the U.S. Attorney's in the various states and did a lot of good work, I like to think, but it was that sort of national exposure that I think put me in a position where my name was mentioned for the [7th circuit] district court.
Speaker 1: Now what year are you doing that?
Speaker 2: The drug task force is '82 [1982].
Story_ID: 20330
Speaker 1: Who was your mentor at the time?  The - I had worked under three different U.S. Attorneys. I started out with [Samuel] Sam [K.] Skinner. Then I worked for [Thomas] Tom Sullivan for four years and then [Daniel] Dan Webb. So all of them  were mentors to me, and very supportive. And very supportive of me when my name was mentioned for the District Court.  And what do you think you learned from them? You know, because there's the academic side, I mean academic side of practice and then the practical side. What did you learn about what it took to be a good litigator?
Speaker 2: Well I learned from all of them. These were not new lessons, but how important it was to work hard, and to put the time in that you needed to put in. And how important it was to have good judgment and to weigh all the facts and look at the whole picture, when trying to make a decision about a prosecution and examining all the angles and making sure all the bases were covered. And then most importantly, making sure you were doing the right thing and that you were being fair. That it was not a question of just how many wins did you have; it was a question of how did you proceed in those cases? Did you play by the rules? Were you fair to the defendants? And so that was very important, an important lesson that I learned from all of them. And then just the ability to deal with the number of enemies that they had to deal with as U.S. Attorneys. All the various agencies, the different agents, all the Assistant U.S. Attorneys and so from a managerial standpoint, and learning how to work with that many diverse people, I learned a lot of lessons from them, and how to run a meeting and how to get people to do what you want them to do. I mean they were very good, all three of them in getting people to do what they wanted them to do, in terms of working and putting together a working group. So I learned that from them.
Story_ID: 20331
Speaker 1: During this time period here in Chicago [Illinois], you can't talk about any cases at that point. Can you talk about anything that, no? Okay.  No. Well I mean, you mean cases that I was on?  Or cases that maybe you learned a lesson from. Not identify exactly what the case, but maybe where you were--it was sort of a surprise to you or maybe something that--
Speaker 2: Well I had a case--I had a case--I remember this case well. I had a case that involved someone from the Philippines, a defendant and the defense attorney had asked whether--and there was a confession and the guy had confessed to the agents in the Philippines. And there was a routine motion to suppress, not a routine motion to suppress, but a routine motion asking for discovery, what were the circumstances of the arrest and that kind of thing and part of what you did was you always interviewed the agents to find out if any promises were made, if any threats were made, that kind of thing, because the defense is entitled to know what happened during the interview and what was said. And I had asked the agent about it a couple of times and there was nothing to turn over. And then the night before when I was preparing the agent to testify, he then began to tell me that when he sat down with this particular defendant, he was telling him that he was really lucky, that they had caught him, because if he had stayed in that country, that they used cattle prods and shock treatments and all these other things. And then the guy confessed. Well, when I found that out, and the agent told me everything very candidly, and I just sort of nodded and then I called my trial partner in and I started at the top of the interview and I had him relay again, what had happened and we let him go on his way. And I looked at my trial partner and I said, "Oh, we have to turn this over."  And I called up the defense attorney who was also working late, because we were getting ready for this trial and I said, "You need to come down here right now."  And I told him what the guy said and of course, no surprise. A big motion to suppress was filed the next day. The confession suppressed, and we went on. We ultimately lost that case, but it was a lesson in, you know, the fact that you don't want, you have to play by the rules and you have to do the right thing. And that judge that I was before, since commented on how much that meant to him, how significant that was, that it would be brought to his attention, and how he admired the fact that the prosecution turned that information over. So that was how I tried to proceed when I was in the U.S. Attorneys office and that was one story. Another case, this was just a fun case I had. There was a guy named Dennis Roberts, who in the Christmas issue of TV Guide, advertised for digital watches. And at that time, digital watches were a rarity and he was offering them for $19.95, cheaper than anywhere else. And some deal if you bought two, maybe it was $25.95 and if you bought two, $19.95 each of some really low price at that time. And he advertised in TV Guide, and he received almost $2 million dollars worth of orders and then like two or three days before Christmas, the phones started ringing off the hook, because the watches were not delivered and he had guaranteed delivery before Christmas. And ultimately through great investigation of the agents, he was identified, living under an assumed name, and I had an opportunity to try that case, and that was a great case to try. He was ultimately convicted but it was just a fun case. It was my first major trial that went about three weeks and that was a great experience.
Story_ID: 20332
Speaker 1: Now what do you think makes a good prosecutor?  Well, just, I think --  Perry Mason--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well he's a good defense attorney. Right but I mean I think a good trial lawyer really on both sides. I think I'd rather think more in terms of a good trial lawyer, because I think a great trial lawyer knows how to relate to people. And knows how to paint the picture or tell the story of the case in a way that is simple and clear and direct. And a really good trial lawyer has not forgotten what it's like to be a human being. And so they're not caught up in a lot of the legal jargon and long speeches and lots of gas that comes out of people who are, you know, so taken with the fact that they're lawyers. Trial lawyers are just basic, plain people that know how to sell a case. Now, that doesn't mean that you're not sophisticated and that you don't understand the legal theories, but you've looked at those things and you know how to break it down in order to sell it and make it believable. I think credibility is very important with the trial lawyers, because I think you have to have the jurors that believe you. You have to have the judges who have trust and confidence in you and it's very important that your opponents believe that you're ethical and trustworthy, and you're going to do things aboveboard. So those are things that I think are important.  So you worked, how many years at U.S. Attorney's office?  Almost ten years.
Story_ID: 20333
Speaker 1: And it was the last experience, the Washington, DC -- you know exposure. Was there anything about that experience that you considered important, I mean you enjoyed it. Was there anything --
Speaker 2: Well the fact that I got to work and interact with the main Justice [department, Department of Justice,Washington, D.C.] and all these other assistants around the country and to meet and work with the U.S. Attorney was a great experience. And I had to organize the meetings and we had regional meetings, where we educated the agents and things like that. And one of the things that was really helpful with that experience was the fact that I had to work with so many different kinds of people and with so many different agencies and so I like to think of that as a place where I had a chance to hone my settlement skills. You know, to work with all these groups, find some common theme people could rally around, and try to move forward with a goal and an agenda. And because I had to listen a lot to these various groups, I think that got my ear ready for the time when I served as a judge, because you have to listen so much. You have to try to discern as a judge, particularly when you're working on settlement conferences, what the religion is, what it is that people really want out of their litigation and try to bring both sides to the table to negotiate some kind of settlement.
Story_ID: 20334
Speaker 1: So what I asked is, were you at that point was you know, was being a judge, was that in your mind's eye?
Speaker 2: No. Really, the first--I was trying a case in 1980 before one of the senior judges. And it was a situation where the lawyers, the defense attorneys had made an objection and the judge was a senior judge and he did not want to hear the objection. And under the rules, you have a right to explain what your objection is, you know? Because if the judge doesn't know the basis for the objection, how can the judge rule? And if the judge hears the basis, you have preserved your right on appeal--and still didn't rule with you, you can go to the court of appeals and try to show there was an error in the judge's ruling. Well the judge, it was toward the end of the day, the judge didn't want to hear anymore. And the lawyers made the objection, the defense attorneys--and the judge said, I don't want to hear it. And they were like, but judge, we need to give you the basis. And he said I don't want to hear it. And he popped up off the bench, and ended it for the day. Well, I knew that could be error and I knew that they were entitled to get the reasons. So I told his reporter that I needed to see him. There was a matter that I had forgotten and so the judge came out and the defense attorneys were furiously packing their bags, ready to make a quick escape, knowing that they had some error on the record. And right as they were walking out the door, I said, "Counsel--." Oh no, the judge came back and I said, "Oh judge, there's one matter we need to take up. I believe that if counsel are not given this opportunity  to give the basis for their objection, that would be reversible error and you could be reversed."  And so the lawyers were trying to race out the courtroom and I said, "Oh counsel, counsel, if you want to give your reasons, now's the time. Can they give you the reasons, judge?"  He said, "Oh yes, Ms. Williams, they can."  And they gave the reasons. That judge wrote a letter to the U.S. Attorney, who was my U.S. Attorney at the time, Tom Sullivan. And at that time, 1980, there were no women judges in Chicago. And the judge suggested that I might be a good candidate for the district court. Well, there was no way. I was only out of law school five years, but I was very flattered, because the U.S. Attorney gave me a copy of that letter. I was very flattered by what the judge had said. But--and so I guess that was the first time it had ever crossed my radar screen, the possibility of being a judge. But even with that, I thought the odds were so slim and so remote, it was not in my game plan to look for a judgeship. The only thing on my game plan was in terms of how long I stayed with the U.S. Attorney's office, I knew that I needed to keep getting promoted. Because you know, it's a little more difficult when you go into private practice and if you've been there eight years and you have never been in any kind of supervisory position that can sometimes be a problem, depending on what the work was that you were doing in the office. But I had not thought about it.
Story_ID: 20335
Speaker 1: Now, so when you--I want you to describe the circumstances under which your appointment happened. And I'd like to know at that point, were you at the top of where you could be? Was there still movement up?
Speaker 2: Well I was chief of a major criminal division. And this was the Drug Task Force. This was a piece of the criminal division. There's obviously, well not obviously, but there is a Chief of the Criminal Division and that would have been a larger division, because there were more assistants there. And then there's a position of first assistant U.S. Attorney or even U.S. Attorney.
Speaker 1: (inaudible)  Are appointed by the President--do they usually--
Speaker 2: Come from the ranks. The last, well, [Samuel K.] Skinner was hired as a regular assistant U.S. Attorney and I think was chief of a division and first assistant when he--I think when he became U.S. Attorney. [Thomas] Sullivan came from private practice. He was a defense attorney. [Daniel] Webb had been in the U.S. Attorney's office, although he had left the U.S. Attorney's office and gone into private practice. Fred Foreman was a State's Attorney. Jim Burns was in the U.S. Attorney's office for many years, as an assistant and supervisor, went into private practice and came back. And Scott Lazar came from the U.S. Attorney's office--was ultimately a supervisor, left, went into private practice and came back. So, a number of former assistants have become U.S. Attorneys. But, my name was mentioned in 1984 as a possible candidate. Well I had been involved and worked for the federal government for the judge and in the U.S. Attorney's office my whole career, so I was a political animal. I was not involved in politics. Couldn't get involved in politics because under the Hatch Act, when you're a federal employee, you can't politick [The Hatch Act restricts the political activity of federal government and some state and local employees who work in connection with federally funded programs.]  So, when my name was mentioned, I was very flattered, but I thought the odds were not very good in my favor. And in fact, David [husband] and I had this, it wasn't a game, but it was like a hundred steps and when little things would happen, we'd--it was going down you know we were at step a hundred and then we were at ninety-nine and then we were at ninety-eight. So, every time there would be some progress made, we'd move down or if there wasn't progress, we'd move up. So, my name was mentioned, and I was asked to apply to [United States] Senator [Charles] Percy, because at that time he was the senator in Illinois. And because it's the senator who is in the office who is in the party of the President that makes the recommendation. And I filled out a lengthy, lengthy form, and in fact, the form came two or three days before my youngest child was born. And so, when we were at the hospital, the form has just arrived. I was told to turn it around as quickly as possible. So, David was in the hospital reading the questionnaire to me. You know, what year did you graduate from law school? What--so the nurse came in and this was the beginning labor, obviously. A nurse came in and said, "Oh, oh, Miss, you know you're already pre-registered! He doesn't need to fill out any paperwork."  I said, "Oh, that's all right dear, it's something else."  And it was really the paperwork for the district court. Well, there came a time when the labor pains were such that I had to give David the forms and say we'll deal with this later. So after Claire was born, two or three days after, of course, my mother was living with us and I was filling out these forms. Getting these forms in and at that time, you filled out a form for Senator Percy and then if you passed the muster, he would then send your name to various bar associations. So, my name went to six or seven bar associations. The Chicago Council, the Federal Bar Association, the Illinois State Bar Association, The Chicago Bar Association, The Cook County Bar Association. All these bar associations, and they all have forms that you fill out, that all had to do with what was your experience, why you know, all of your background. And then they all had interview committees. So you interviewed with all the different committees, and I did that. And then the interview results were sent back to the senator and then the senator would select who he would recommend to the President. So I was recommended and then I had to go through the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] check and the American Bar Association had to give you a qualified or better rating. And once that was done and I cleared that, then I got the nomination. Because the White House won't nominate you unless you've cleared. So, I was nominated in October but was not confirmed and had to wait for the election and then I was re-nominated in January or February and confirmed in April of '85 [1985].
Story_ID: 20336
Speaker 1: Now how does that, you said you and David [husband] had this poll--the hundred points.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: How does that feel as you're moving through the process? I mean there were times that you were sort of pinching yourself or was it--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah. Oh yeah as we would, you know as I would get the qualified ratings you know I don't know where that was,  you know, maybe it was step fifty. And I mean as things would fall into place, we'd move closer and closer. But we still didn't believe--it wasn't like something you took to the bank! Because on these judicial appointments, you know there is no sort of, well once you're nominated, within twenty-one days, you'll get a hearing. There are no rules like that. Or once you have a hearing, within five days, there will be a vote on the [United States] Senate floor, you are subject to what the Senate wants to do. So, they can hold the hearings whenever they want to hold the hearings and they can vote whenever they choose to vote! That's their prerogative, and so, even as we move through the process and felt that things were moving along, you just never know. And so--
Story_ID: 20337
Speaker 1: You were, why were you appealed? Do you think, you know because you were very young at that point still.
Speaker 2: Thirty-five.
Speaker 1: Yeah but was it the youngest female?
Speaker 2: I was the youngest that had ever been appointed in this [7th] circuit  [Northern District of Illinois] and one of the youngest ever appointed at thirty-five. And I was appointed at a time when there were five new positions created in Chicago on the Northern District of Illinois. So I think that was a very good thing for me. The fact that there were five positions [U. S.] Senator [Charles] Percy had to fill. So as someone who had not been involved in politics at all, more of a through the ranks kind of candidate, I had a better shot, because there were four other positions. So I think that was helpful to me. It was 1985 when I went on. We had our first woman in this District [Northern District of Illinois] in 1980, Susan Getzendanner, Illana [Diamond] Rovner went on in '84 [1984], so we were still low in terms of women. In terms of African-Americans, Jim Parsons went on in -'61 [1961] and George [N.] Leighton went on in '75 [sic. appointed by President Gerald Ford in Febuary 4, 1976.] So I had been nine years since someone of color had been appointed. And you know I had, even though I was thirty-five, I had been in the U.S. Attorneys office almost ten years, and I had tried a lot of cases. A lot more than some of the people who were on the bench. So, and it was the quality of that experience, plus I had done all this teaching with various law schools and the National Institute for Trial Advocacy, and I had been involved actively in the legal community, serving on panels and I taught at the Attorney General's Trial Advocacy School. You know, I was very involved. And so, I think that and then in these forms  that you have to fill out, you have to list all of your opponents, all the defense attorneys, all the people you tried cases against. I think they thought well of me. So I think it was a combination of all those things. You know? And also things happen for a reason and it was the right time and I was blessed.
Story_ID: 20338
Speaker 1: So I just wanted to question about it, it's just that you were appointed under President [Ronald] Reagan and all those things that you point to seem antithetical, you know the type of people that they took (inaudible) to go after. You know, you're smart, you're bright and you've got this great track record. I mean that was not always viewed as typical of African Americans.
Speaker 2: Although, there are at least two or three that went through, like Henry Wingate in Mississippi, and James Spencer in Virginia, that had similar backgrounds--who had been in the U.S. Attorney's office. And see, when you're in the U.S. Attorney's office, you appeared before a lot of judges. And of course, judges are contacted during the screening and during the evaluation. And I had spent my life in the [Dirksen] Federal Building [Chicago, Illinois]. So I had--you know that made a big difference and of course, who were the lawyers that I interacted with, all federal practitioners! Now, I think it would have been a very different story, had I been in the State's Attorney's office. But a lot of the judges were very supportive of me, and so I think that's what helped to make the difference. Being here and being in this building, I think made a big difference.
Story_ID: 20339
Speaker 1: So now you get the call. You once described this. You got the call and this is the President is on the phone?
Speaker 2: I was nursing Claire, so basically threw Claire to my mother. I raced up the stairs because I had gotten this answering machine and I wanted to record it. And so I was totally breathless when I got to the phone. And I don't think I recorded it, but I wanted to run upstairs so I could hear it, because the baby was crying. So I ran upstairs and I said, and you know, when the White House calls, it's not something like you say "Well I'm nursing the baby. Have him call back."  So, you react instantly, because the White House makes that assumption because all they say is "The White House calling. The President will be on the line."  And that's it! So you just stop whatever you're doing. So I raced upstairs. I was out of breath and he said, you know, "Miss Williams?"  And I said, "Yes, Mr. President," totally breathless. And he said, "I'm calling to see if you would serve in a position as a judge for the Northern District of Illinois." And I said, "I'd be honored Mr. President."  And he said "Your parents must be very proud." And I said, "Oh, they are! They are!"  And I thanked him for the call. And I understand that he called every judge that he nominated, which was pretty amazing.  That's amazing. As you're telling the story, I'm thinking, there's lots of other people will be calling you. That's not typical though.  No, it's not. No it's not typical. So, and so it was after that when I was nominated in now it's January or February of '85 [1985] and I was confirmed in April of '85 [1985].
Story_ID: 20340
Speaker 1: Now your confirmation process wasn't laborious.
Speaker 2: No. I had had a hearing. I had a hearing in the fall, in the fall of '84 [1984]. I had a hearing, either late September, early October. I want to say early October but didn't get confirmed before the election. A number of people got confirmed before the election. I didn't. I was confirmed the next session.  So you're back in your home. I mean this is basically starting to become your home base. The place where you clerked and you had--so did that feel? I mean there's the whole process and it's much different being a lawyer than a judge.
Speaker 1: It is. And it was an adjustment. I mean it was an adjustment. But it was great, because I knew a lot of the people who worked in the [7th circuit] district court. Hiring my mini-clerk was easy. You know, court reporters. The judges had all seen me sort of grow up before them. So when I appeared before them, one of the things that was hard to do was to learn to call them by their first names, because I was so used to calling them by their last names as judges. But they were very welcoming to me and I had a history with them, and that made a difference. So it was like I was just coming into the family and I had been here all along. So they treated me with great respect. And in many ways, like a daughter, you know? Because when I--the fact that I had been in the building that long. But it was a great experience to join the bench here.
Story_ID: 20341
Speaker 1: Did you feel it [isolated]? Because the rules have changed.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, it is. It really changes. I mean the one disadvantage of going on at a young age is, when you're thirty-five and you're in private practice, that's a time when you are really working with your colleagues and working very closely with other lawyers in the firm. And so that camaraderie of every day talking about the cases you're on and trying cases together, that doesn't happen when you're on the district court. Now, I said that all the judges were very open and happy that I was appointed, and when we got together, we had a great time. But everybody was so busy, the caseload is heavy in this district--you aren't together a lot. There's every Wednesday morning coffee around 8 [a.m.] or 8:30 [a.m.], coffee and doughnuts. And occasionally I would make that session and that was good. And then we have judges meetings once a month and we have lunch before the judge's meeting. And that was a way to socialize but just the amount of contact that you would have in private practice just doesn't exist, except for your staff. Your law clerks, your secretary, your court reporter, and your mini clerk. So that becomes your family, your court family. But it is isolating. Because you have to be concerned, you know, if you have friends that are trying cases before you, you can't go to lunch with them while that's going on. If the case is pending, depending on the circumstances, you may not want to go to lunch with them while the case is pending. I mean there are different ethical rules that we have to operate under. And so, there's a point where you know, if you have to think well do I have a case before or do I have this? Do I have that? You just sort of fall off the radar screen. I mean you have contacts and you still see some of your closest friends, but most often you're seeing lawyers at Chicago [Illinois] Bar Association meetings, luncheons, cocktail parties, at the annual dinners. And you as a judge, have to get more involved and have to do things within the legal community in order to keep that connection. Otherwise, you'd be very isolated. So the teaching of Neta was very helpful to me in just staying connected to the bar and being in an atmosphere where I could be called Ann and not 'Judge' all the time. And participating in various panel discussions in front of the bar associations and with the young lawyers division. That really helped me to stay connected, but it is very isolating and it's quite an adjustment. Especially those first couple of years, when you're used to a lot of interaction.
Story_ID: 20342
Speaker 1: You know what made you successful was your youth and your race. And I'm just wondering some people could have fallen on their face.
Speaker 2: Well you know, it's like during the interview process, someone at one of the bar associations said, "Well, now if you become a judge, and you are confirmed, I mean you'll be the first black woman and you're only thirty-five years old. How will you handle that?" and I said "Well, I've been a black woman all my life and I've learned to handle that." And I think that I've always believed that in the end, justice will prevail and so if you do a good job, that good job will be recognized. And that, I felt that I was capable of doing the work based on all the trial experience I'd had in the courts. And so it didn't really matter to me what someone else's perception was, because I knew I could do the job. And I think if you carry yourself in that way, with confidence and you put the time in, and you know what you're doing and you're willing to learn, which I was willing to learn, you can be successful. And so I never felt that that was a barrier or something that was going to hold me back. I tried to turn that into an advantage being black and being a woman. And you know I think people will underestimate you and have underestimated me at various points, and in many ways you can turn that to your advantage. Because when people think that you are not quite up to snuff or whatever, it allows you to perhaps rise to greater heights, than if they really realize what your true capabilities were. And so that's never been a problem for me. Because I just feel like any injustice will prevail and that I would earn the kind of reputation that I would be proud of in district court. And then you go about that in a very sort of methodical way, so I knew that I had had criminal experience and the only civil experience I had was in teaching and I knew that there was that question, well she's only done criminal, but I also knew that I was a trial lawyer. I knew the rules of evidence were the same. And if I put the time in, I would be able to get up to snuff on the civil side. And so I decided very consciously to try one of the oldest, most difficult antitrust cases that the [7th circuit] district [court] had ever seen, early in, my second year on the bench. Because I knew that if I did well in trying that case that would have an impact on my reputation. And I tried that case and it went very well and it did have that kind of impact. Because ultimately, I saw a letter from one of the lawyers to the senator, talking to a senator--not even [United States] Senator [Charles] Percy--to another senator, indicating how well I had handled the trial. This was way after the trial was over and how things. So you know if you know that, you can work that to your advantage. And I have never been someone who was afraid of hard work and so I just put the time in and then I tried to be courteous to the lawyers and as a trial lawyer, you know, when you've been there and you've done that, I think it makes a difference in how you approach being a judge. So I think I was firm but fair to everybody that appeared before me.
Story_ID: 20343
Speaker 1: Were you ever returned?
Speaker 2: Well, you mean reversed? Yeah, everybody is reversed. That's part of the job. Sometimes you rule and of course it's the job of the court of appeals to look at it to see if there are any errors and sometimes they reverse you. That doesn't mean the court of appeals is right. It just means you got reversed. But that's part of the job and you expect that.
Story_ID: 20344
Speaker 1: So what do you think, 1985--
Speaker 2: Almost 15 years.
Speaker 1: I mean that's most people don't get appointed that early. So were you sort of looking for the next thing at that point. Or, you know, because people retire--you know--many, many people retire from being a judge and especially a district court judge, its sort of top of the heap.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well here in the federal system, you can't really retire until you're sixty-five. And you have to have a minimum of ten years in. So judges who go in the court say at fifty-five, can go on senior status at sixty-five. So they put in--someone who goes in at fifty-five puts in ten years, and you can do the math. Me going on at thirty-five--right. So it's quite a long period of time. So, I loved my job on the district court. I loved the interaction I had with jurors. I liked being right there in the fray. People often ask me if I miss being a trial lawyer, I didn't miss being a trial lawyer because I was in the trial environment. And even though I wasn't the one down there in the well of the courtroom trying the case, I was there for the magic cross examination, the great closing arguments, the wonderful opening statements. I mean, it was a very exciting and the thing I think I love the most was the interaction with the jurors. And trying to make the trains run on time. Trying to be as fair as possible. And explaining to the jurors what was going on in the courtroom. I mean I just really liked it a lot and I have a lot of souvenirs and trinkets and letters from jurors who have written, who resisted, resisted, resisted when they were called to serve. But having had the experience, said that it was really important and significant and they understood the significance of the position and why it made such a difference and the difference it makes, the American legal system. And so, anyway I love that part of the job and but I was also and I could have stayed as a district courtjudge, but when the opportunity came for the Court of Appeals, that was something that I thought I would find interesting. It would be an opportunity for me to grow and it would be a challenge in a different way. And it would also be full-circle, having started as a clerk, and I think that it is an advantage to be on the court of appeals and to have had that time on the [7th Circuit] district court, because then you understand what it's like for a trial judge, who is basically calling the balls and strikes in a very tense, fast-moving environment. So it was a wonderful experience, but I'm happy that I was nominated and confirmed for this position on the [7th Cirsuit] Court of Appeals.
Story_ID: 20345
Speaker 1: So, how have you found--its been, you know (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Really, November, I think it was November 10th. I better get that date.  But you've been serving--Yeah, but I was informally sworn in--in--When did I get--well yeah I got confirmed, I think it was November 10, 1999. So I was informally sworn in within a few days of that date. But then my formal ceremony was in January [2000].
Story_ID: 20346
Speaker 1: How have you found, is there a difference being on the court?
Speaker 2: Big difference. Because in the district court, you're actually trying the cases, seeing the witnesses lie, hearing the lawyers make their arguments, taking the verdict from the jury, guilty or not guilty. Or you're ruling on cases without a trial, but you're making the final decision on say somebody's social security claim, or you might have a tax case, or it could be a civil rights case. But you make that initial call. In the court of appeals you are reading and reviewing the record below, so you read the opinions of the district court. You review the evidence that's been presented or the testimony that's been presented, to determine if any errors were made in the trial. And if those errors were made, were they so significant that the case has to be retried and sent back to the district court? And if there were no errors that were significant, then the next step for someone in the federal system, is to go to the United States Supreme Court. Now the Supreme Court only accepts two to three percent of what's filed before it. So for all practical purposes, most cases end in the court of appeals. The other difference is, it's a three-state region versus just this Northern District of Illinois. So cases come from Indiana and from Wisconsin. And the other big difference is, you are the judge. You call the balls and strikes in the district court. In the court of appeals, three judges sit together to hear the appeal and then two out of three have to vote either to affirm the district court, that is, what the district court did was appropriate, or to reverse what the district court did. And, say you need a new trial. So, it's more of a group effort, even though you're independent and you come to your decision on the case independently. So each judge has a vote and has to vote one way or the other. So, that's very different. So you don't see live witnesses. The interaction you have with the case is the lawyers who argue before you and most often, the oral argument might be ten minutes, fifteen minutes a side. So you might have a half hour where they actually discuss the legal issues in the case. So it's very different. And you're looking at cases in a broader sort of sense. In the district court you're just basically trying that one case, making that one decision. In the court of appeals, you are deciding that one case, but it's very important to consider the impact that that case has on all the law of the circuit. Not that you didn't consider all the law in the circuit in the district court, but you're just more focused on that in the court of appeals. And the precedent or the rulings in the court of appeals are binding on all the district court judges. So in other words, if the court of appeals has ruled one way on a particular issue and it comes up before a district judge, if there's no real way to distinguish it, you have to follow what the court of appeals says.
Story_ID: 20347
Speaker 1: Twenty years from now come back and say, you know, ask you the same questions or ask you similar questions but what do you, what would you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: First as a (unclear)
Speaker 2: Well, that I was a fair and good judge, that I called them like I saw them. That I was fair to all persons, regardless of their color, race or sex or whatever. That I worked hard and I tried to do my best to make sure that that inscription on the Supreme Court, or that really the phrase "Equal justice to all," is meaningful and is applied in our system. So, I would really want to be known as a fair and just judge that was careful, took into account what needed to be considered and was thoughtful and that never forgot that there were people behind the names in the cases.
Story_ID: 20348
Speaker 1: Can you refuse some of the cases that you've worked on, you know that were more high--you've been involved in a lot of high profile cases.
Speaker 2: You mean in the district court? Oh, and I should also say just in terms of--you just want that as the judge legacy. But I would also say as the judge legacy, someone who recognized how blessed she was and the obligation that she had to pass on that knowledge to make the path easier for those that follow. That never forgot  her humanity that tried to remain a real person that people could touch. That didn't let the role get in the way of the humanity, and try to use the position to the good. So that the various things that I've been involved in, like the Just The Beginning Foundation, where we try to educate the public to the contributions that African Americans have made in the [federal judicial] system. To create materials that can go to the schools to provide scholarships that those things were very important and you know by doing, I can demonstrate how important public service is or the Federal Judges Association, which I'm president right now. Where we're really pushing toward getting salaries that will in some way compensate judges for the big sacrifices they're making for serving in these positions. And how important the independence of the judiciary is and that you know, that I didn't just do my job as a judge, but I tried to make a difference in a much broader sense. And because I think sometimes you can get so narrowly focused, and that's not to say that I don't spend the amount of time I need to on my work. But, sometimes I think judges think you should just, you know--you just focus on your work and that's how they want to live their lives and of course, that's their choice. But I think that we need, you know, to expand and we need to play a role in the community and so I would like to have that legacy that I tried to make a difference in the legal community and in the broader community and that I didn't just talk the talk, that I actually did things and I was active in the community and tried to make a difference.
Story_ID: 20349
Speaker 1: The cases that (inaudible).
Speaker 2: Well I had the [Ernest] Rocco Infelise case, which was the big mob--which was a case--I don't want to say the mob, but was a case where a number of individuals were charged with racketeering, shaking down various establishments for street tax. This would be gambling establishments, houses of prostitution, various things. There was at least one murder involved. That was a big case, a long trial.  I think that was four or five months I had the case involving the new post office, and I can't remember the name of the company but it was a case that involved the steel beams and the bolts were not screwed tightly, as they should have been and the structure collapsed and two men died, and lost their lives and that company was indicted. And I tried it. The first criminal case in our district dealing with that kind of OSHA [Occupational Safety and Health Administration] violation, the Ohio Sealy antitrust case, which was the Sealy Mattress case, which had been around in this District for over twelve years. The case I mentioned earlier that was a significant antitrust case. The Stevens v. Tillman case which involved  a school principal who was suing the parent's association for libel and slander. She lost her position as principal of this school and that was a very high profile, highly contentious type trial. The 'Good Friday' case, where a Jewish schoolteacher sued the school system, particularly the Chicago Public Schools because the schools close down on Good Friday. And I had that case and she argued that you know, it showed a preference to the Christian religion and I was really surprised when I got the case, because I assumed there had been lots of rulings on that, just like the Christmas crèche cases. And I was really surprised, there were only two other cases that have ruled on Good Friday cases, I mean in the country. One involved Hawaii, where Good Friday has become a major shopping day there. So, it was an alternate secular purpose and it was upheld. And then another case where they had prohibited liquor being sold on Good Friday and that was reversed. And then I had my case--and I said that the only purpose I could find that Good Friday served, was you know in memory of Christ dying. It was only religious and there was no other secular purpose and then suggested in the opinion that there were other state regulations that would allow like the school system in Skokie [Illinois] where a number of people are Jewish and those schools are closed for Jewish holidays. But there's a provision in the state law that allows for school closings if you anticipate that a number of your teachers and children will not come to school. So in other words, you operate the school and very few kids would be there, so you'd have spent all this money to run the school and have no teachers or no students. So there is a regulation that allows that. But that was a case that was of pretty high profile that I had. And there's one case that is still pending, so I can't comment on that. That was pretty high, but I know I've had some others, I know I've had some corruption kind of cases, some corruption trials. And I think I had a trial involving the Mercantile Exchange [Chicago, Illinois]. I think I tried the first case that involved that.
Story_ID: 20350
Speaker 1: Well let's talk about you know, your mentors. Because a lot of them, I mean you did a great thing in even starting the Just The Beginning Foundation, which that was something that had not been done before. But who actually influenced you, because when you hear your story, it's almost--it's in many ways, a fairy tale story, or so it appears. And a story that doesn't seem to--where your race really had much impact in a negative way.
Speaker 2: Well, see I think it has. I think it's helped shape who I am, but my recognizing what the barriers are, by recognizing what's out there, by recognizing attitudes, which I said a lot comes from my parents. It did not crush me. So that when things happened, that I felt were based on the color of my skin, I did not let them destroy me or crush me. Because I knew I could overcome it. So I think that's what made the big difference for me, was attitude. It was attitude and that doesn't mean that I didn't, you know, cry or get upset or wasn't depressed when a door was closed in my face and I felt it had to do with race. But because of the sort of base that my parents have provided, and because I had faith, that I could overcome, and the Lord would help me find a way, I wouldn't let--I didn't let that block the door. And so that's what I mean when I say that I think about slavery and what those people suffered through, you know, and then I say, well anything that and see like when you use that as a comparison, you really can say I can move forward. But so my parents were very inspirational to me. And then of course, I had come from Detroit [Michigan] and that is the home of Damon Keith, and he was one of my great role models. And as I got into the--oh one of the other role models I had was a professor at Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois], Ron Kennedy, who was on the faculty at Northwestern, who started a program for Northwestern graduates to help them pass the bar. And it was the year that I took the bar. And I got to know the students who were at Northwestern, graduates, we became friends. I found out that he was, he was having the right sample bar exams and at that time, the pass rate for blacks in Illinois was about 33 percent. And I was interested in getting in the class, so I asked one of my friends to ask him and he said no, because I didn't go to Northwestern. And I had never forgot that. And when I got to the U.S. Attorneys office, a guy came in the office who was a Northwestern grad, I asked him if Kennedy still did the program, he said yes. And I said, "Well you know, I would really like to see that program expanded to non-Northwestern students. Would you be willing to introduce me to Kennedy?" And he said he would. So he set up a meeting and we went to see Kennedy. And Kennedy was a little skeptical, you know, who am I? You know, not off the street, but I mean, you know, and I said I really thought he had a great idea and a great concept. And I would be interested in expanding it and he was very concerned, because his pass rate was extremely high, like 100%. And he didn't want to tamper with that. You know?  And I understood  that and I said, "Well look, if I could get a few of my friends, would you train us and let us work with you and let us do a non-Northwestern group and a Northwestern group and if we do as well in our non-Northwestern group as your Northwestern group, then we can talk?"  And we did. And I got them. And we started the Minority Legal Education Resources Inc., which was formed in 1977 that started out as a free program, and was open to all students but focused primarily on minority students. And it's an organization that's in existence today and I continue to lecture twice a year to help people pass the bar. And so he was a role model, because of the way he started the program and he saw that was an important and it was for free and there was really no glory or credit to him. He just did it cause it was the right thing and I had been somebody who tried to find things like that that I could identify with. And try to get people to rally around the cause, because the cause is more important and therefore, you don't get involved in the politics of things. But he was an inspiration and then [U.S. Supreme Court Justice] Thurgood Marshall was an inspiration of mine, as well as Constance [Baker] Motley [first black woman federal judge, Southern District of New York, 1966], you know? And as I got to know more of the legal figures you know, they became a source of inspiration and part of the Just the Beginning Foundation, why that was so important to me was, to hear the stories of these older judges and to hear their struggles and what it was like for them. And the barriers that they were able to overcome, again, makes me say any barrier that is placed before me is a barrier that I can overcome.

Speaker 1: But he was an inspiration and then [U.S. Supreme Court Justice] Thurgood Marshall was an inspiration of mine, as well as Constance Motley [first black woman federal judge, Southern District of New York, 1966], you know? And as I got to know more of the legal figures you know, they became a source of inspiration and part of the Just the Beginning Foundation, why that was so important to me was, to hear the stories of these older judges and to hear their struggles and what it was like for them, and the barriers that they were able to overcome, again, makes me say any barrier that is placed before me is a barrier that I can overcome. So I don't want to give the impression that I was born with a gavel as my favorite toy or a silver spoon or that there weren't times that doors were not closed. Because there have been times when I have wanted--I mean when I began in the U.S. Attorney's office, it was not the division that I wanted to go in, that initial division. But I knew I had to get my foot in the door. So, when I got an offer in that division, I took that. And once I got in the office I knew that I wanted to move to this mainline criminal division and once I realized that, I then began to volunteer to do work in the mainline division. So that I could show the quality of my work and get one of the supervisors there to carry the torch, to help get me where I needed to go. There was a point in the office where in terms of sort of 'sexy high profile' cases that were being tried, a number of women and I that were of the same experience level as the men, realized that we weren't--didn't appear that we were being assigned those high profile cases. I went and had a sit down with the--before I had a sit down with the supervisor, I considered other options, like going to the State's Attorney office or doing something else. And then one of the wise judges in this building said, "Well you need to talk with your supervisor. Maybe he doesn't realize what's going on."  So I went down, talked to him and said, "Look, I don't know, this doesn't seem to add up to me."  And two weeks later he gave me a call. He put me on a really high profile case with him. And I was not asking to be on the trial with him, but I knew I wasn't going to look a gift horse in the mouth, and I said yes. And I did well in that trial and then I got great trials. And a lot of the other women got great trials. So, there have been struggles, there have been issues. But again, I think it's you know, to me, if you run into a brick wall, if you can't find a ladder to get over the wall, then you have maybe have to change directions. But until you realize that there is no ladder there, you try to develop strategies that are going to help you get over the wall. And I'm not a Pollyanna either, because I don't think that everybody can get over the wall in every circumstance. Sometimes your past has to vary and you have to go another way. But I just really do have faith that you know, in the end, justice will prevail. And that's always been my motto.

Speaker 1: What do you consider the genius of Justice [A. Leon] Higginbotham? What was his genius?
Speaker 2: His mind was brilliant and he was so articulate. And his ability to just hone in on a particular issue and explain it and his way of storytelling and the analogies that he used and his love of words. And I don't know, it's just really hard to capture him in a word. It really is.
Story_ID: 20353
Speaker 1: Okay what about [2nd Circuit Federal District Judge-Southern District, New York] Constance Baker Motley?
Speaker 2: Oh, she has such great dignity and intelligence and a sense of humor and just--great stories to tell and great struggles--but great triumphs and her days with [United States Supreme Court Justice] Thurgood Marshall were wonderful.

Speaker 1: And what about [United States 6th Circuit Appelate] Judge Damon Keith?  Just a phenomenal man who spent his whole life serving.
Speaker 2: So you were asking me about?  Judge Damon Keith?
Speaker 1: Yeah, just a phenomenal person. He has made such a contribution to the judiciary and to the greater community. He was chair of the well let me skip what he was chair of--but it was the Bicentennial Committee that celebrated the Constitution--the national chair for the country and his signature appears at the bottom of the [United States] Constitution in 300 courthouses. He was the 1998 Devitt Award winner [American Judicature Society's Edward J. Devitt Award], which is the award given to the one federal judge who has made more contributions overall. He helped to start the Damon J. Keith Legal Collection at Wayne State University [Detroit, Michigan], and the 'Marching Toward Justice Exhibit' that has traveled to at least twelve courthouses, telling the story of the Fourteenth Amendment and [United Supreme Court Justice] Thurgood Marshall. His energy is boundless, and his love for humanity is limitless. And so he's been like a, you know, a father to me, as have these other role models you mentioned, have been great inspiration to me. Nate Jones, Nathaniel Jones from the 6th Circuit [Court of Appeals], another phenomenal leader and role model and you know, as I have gotten to know them, I'm just in awe. You know that I'm blessed to share the bench with them, because of all they've done with their lives.

Speaker 1: I have one more question and that is, what is the significance  or the importance of blacks serving on the judiciary and why is it something that should be treasured?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that it's important that when people come into a courtroom, they see judges that are part of the American experience. I mean that they see judges who reflect what America is, and that helps to build confidence in the system. When we decide cases, we have to decide them based on the law, based on the precedent, based on what the Supreme Court has ruled. And you take an oath to apply the law as a judge, and you have to follow that law. But it is, it's important that judges reflect the breadth of the community, because of the perception of fairness and the people feeling that their cases are going to be heard fully and fairly and be considered properly.
Story_ID: 20356
Speaker 1: Of the black judges, why are they so important, their role so important to this American society?
Speaker 2: Well certainly judges bring their experiences with them, and they bring their exposure with them. And it's important that those kinds of experiences are reflected in the judges who sit on the bench. Just as it is important that women be part of the federal judiciary, and judges can bring, because you have different lifetime experiences, you can bring that point of view with you, and still be faithful to following the law and the precedents and that kind of thing. But I think it really does make the most difference in the people who come before you, the perception of justice. So you don't necessarily get a different ruling because it's a woman judge, or because it's a black judge. But you certainly have the hope that people will be able to understand what the cases are about and be able to relate to the experience and put that in perspective and still follow the law.
Story_ID: 20357
Speaker 1: Is there anything else you'd like to say?
Speaker 2: Just that you know, in terms of the children that are growing up and that are trying to decide what they're going to do with their lives and is it worth it and that see so many negative role models--that if they believe in themselves and that they can do it and they find people who are willing to help them. And remember that now there are more people than ever that are in a variety of professions and they shouldn't hesitate to seek out or reach out to people that they think can help them and give them advice, because it's theirs for the taking. And that so many of us now that have traveled the roads are willing to help those who come after us, if they would just ask. And so I would beg them to ask and to stay in school, to strive for excellence, to try to do their best, and to be persistent. And remember that we only stand on the shoulders of all those who've come before us.
