Speaker 1: Now we have a few, what we like to call questions that kind of give us that common touch. What's your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food is probably something very plain and simple--a bowl of chili and cornbread, homemade preferably (laughter).

Speaker 1: Your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite color is blue.
Speaker 1: Your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: The beach, I like to be near the water.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: That's a good one, I haven't thought about that. No, I really don't have one. No favorites, I'm afraid.
Story_ID: 465750
Speaker 1: Could you tell me a bit about your mother? And what was her name?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Evelyn Davis [Evelyn Davis Norman]. She's from Mississippi, as was my father [James Norman, Sr.]. My mother was very optimistic, a very strong, resilient woman who managed to accomplish a great, a great deal in her lifetime.
Speaker 1: Did she grow up in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Part of her life was--you know, she grew up in the South. But--
Speaker 1: Which city in Mississippi? Would you know?
Speaker 2: I believe Natchez [Mississippi], I believe Natchez. But she moved to California when she was around junior high school or high school age.
Speaker 1: What else would you know of her, her childhood background, of her early years growing up?
Speaker 2: Not a great deal, actually. I suppose I should have talked with, talked with her about that. I do know that her parents [Emma Davis and John Davis, Sr.] were always hard-working, my grandparents. They saw the opportunity for a better life in California, and that's why they left the South.
Speaker 1: Now, you described her as optimistic, hardworking. How else would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: How else? She was a woman who would just take charge. She was just a natural go-getter. She always wanted to do better; I think that's what really impressed me about her. She was not satisfied for just-so. She thought that she could have a better life, a better home, a better job, and a better, a better life for her children as well.
Speaker 1: Did she share any stories with you about her growing up, her childhood, or anything that stood out, that she ever imparted to you?
Speaker 2: I'm sure my mother told me many stories, but that's one of the disadvantages of growing old. (Laughter) I can't remember those stories now, but she, she did have an interesting childhood. And, and I guess her life in the South was a very simple life. It didn't seem to really, you know, heat up until she moved, moved west. And coming to California that seemed to offer more challenges. It was like coming to a new world for her.
Story_ID: 465751
Speaker 1: Now, tell us about your father. What was his name?
Speaker 2: My father's name was James Norman [James Norman, Sr.].
Speaker 1: And where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was also born in the South. Birthplace, I think Natchez, Mississippi as well.
Speaker 1: And did he grow up mostly in Mississippi, or did he also come to California?
Speaker 2: He, too, came to California around the same time as my mother [Evelyn Davis Norman]. It's interesting that around that time, I believe in the 1930s, much of my family seemed to head west. I don't know exactly what, what caused that migration, but my father, I think he had sort of a so-so job down south. And once again, moving to California gave him opportunities for a new life.
Speaker 1: Do you know a lot about his background growing up?
Speaker 2: No, not a great deal. No, not really. And my father didn't talk that much about his life either, you know. He just wasn't that talkative.
Speaker 1: How would you describe him? Outside of being not, not very loquacious, how would you describe him as a person?
Speaker 2: My father was kind of a laid-back person, not as dynamic as my mother. My father seemed to just sort of go with the flow, you know. He's, I think if I had any kind of, if he had any kind of a shortcoming, it might be that he lacked ambition. I mean he always worked, he was always diligent, but he never seemed to, you know, kind of shoot for the stars, you might say.
Speaker 1: Which was quite a jux- a juxtaposition over your mother, wasn't it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, it was, it was.
Story_ID: 465752
Speaker 1: How far back in your lineage can you go, your ancestry? Can you go back beyond your grandparents? Or how far can you go back?
Speaker 2: No, I really can't. I really can't. And I know my grandparents mainly on my mother's [Evelyn Davis Norman] side. I know very little about my dad's [James Norman, Sr.] parents.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your grandmother on your mother's side, your maternal grandmother. What was her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Emma Davis. And, a hardworking woman, also from the South. She moved west with her husband. And my grandmother was probably a major influence in my life. One of the things she did, she was an advocate of hard work (laughter), and she made us work. As a matter of fact, she didn't like to see children being inactive, laying around. And she would always find a job for us to do.
Speaker 1: Now your grandfather, what was his name?
Speaker 2: My grandfather's name was John Davis [John Davis, Sr.], and I would describe my grandfather as another very hardworking man, a man who worked hard all of his life. And actually, when he stopped working and retired, he didn't like that all; he preferred to be working.
Speaker 1: And they were from Mississippi originally also?
Speaker 2: Yes, they were.
Speaker 1: Were there any stories that they shared with you that you recall to be very important in your life, in your life lessons, stories that you gleaned from them (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Only--my grandparents always encouraged me to work hard and do better, you know, to get an education. I'm sure they told me stories when I was a kid, but a lot of those things I'm afraid have (laughter), have been lost to memory now.
Story_ID: 465753
Speaker 1: What is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory growing up would be maybe hanging out at my [maternal] grandparents' [Emma Davis and John Davis, Sr.] home in Santa Barbara [California] as a little kid, because my grandparents' home was kind of a fascinating place. I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell us about it.
Speaker 2: Well, my grandparents, in Santa Barbara back at that time, that's when people had chickens in their backyard. And I remember my grandparents had a grapevine, and they had--I mean their backyard was just an exciting place for, for a kid to play, you know. And it was just, it was exciting. And my grandmother would, would always be in the kitchen. She was a fantastic cook, you know, baking cakes and cooking all these great meals. And so going to my grandparents' home was just, you know, it was a special day, and that's the place I wanted to be. I mean, I remember having many good times there.
Speaker 1: Tell us some of those stories and memories that you have, of, in your grandparents' house. And also your own home, tell us about that time period. What was daily life like? What was your family life like for you?
Speaker 2: Well, before I started school, because my parents [Evelyn Davis Norman and James Norman, Sr.] were working, they would often leave us kids over at my grandparents' home, because you know, grandparents could look after us. It was just a good environment for a kid because I remember there was a bookshelf in the living room, and I remember going to the bookshelf and they had all kinds of books that I would look through. As a matter of fact, it was in my grandparents' home that I first saw the name, Walt Disney, and asked my grandmother--you know, because I couldn't read, you know, but I recognized that distinctive signature. And I said, you know, "This man's name is always on everything. What is that name?" And she said, "Oh, that's Walt Disney. He's a famous artist, you know, down in Hollywood [Los Angeles, California]. He makes these cartoons." So that, that's one memory that's special to me.
Story_ID: 465754
Speaker 1: Could you please give us your siblings' names in their birth order? And include yourself in the chain (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay. The birth order of my siblings would be John W. Norman [John Norman], Oliver Norman, James Norman [James Norman, Jr.], and myself, and my younger brother, Oljay Wendell Norman [Oljay Norman].
Speaker 1: So, you had five boys?
Speaker 2: Five, five boys. My mother [Evelyn Davis Norman] had five boys, because she actually told us this, she didn't want to have any girls, so she only had boys. Now, how she managed to pull that off, I don't know.
Speaker 1: So with five brothers I'm sure that was quite interesting, and you being almost the youngest, but not quite.
Speaker 2: Almost the youngest, except my two older brothers passed away of spinal meningitis before I even knew them. So, I had two brothers that I never knew. My oldest brother, James, was I believe nine years my senior. So, I really didn't know James that well until I got older, because he was such a big brother. He was--you know, and we were just little kids.
Speaker 1: And then so, so that made you really the big brother, so to speak?
Speaker 2: Only to my little brother, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Exactly.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Only to one brother.
Speaker 1: And what was the difference in years between the two of you?
Speaker 2: Only two, my, my younger brother Wendell. We call him Wendell, even though his name is Oljay. He's always gone by the name Wendell. We're only two years apart.
Story_ID: 465755
Speaker 1: So, what street did you live on in Santa Barbara [California]?
Speaker 2: In Santa Barbara, my [maternal] grandparents [Emma Davis and John Davis, Sr.] lived on a street named Quarantina [Street]. And we were, we lived on a street called Haley [Street], which was sort of a main street in Santa Barbara.
Speaker 1: Can you describe your block growing up, your block that you lived on? How was it?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was the racial makeup? What was the makeup of it?
Speaker 2: The racial makeup of, of my neighborhood was mainly African American and Latino. Very few Asians, although there were a few. There were a few, but mainly African American and Latino back in those days. And it was a typical neighborhood in Santa Barbara--a grocery store, you know, a shoe repair place, you know, little markets, but a very nice neighborhood and a safe place for kids to play, you know. I mean kids could walk the streets by themselves, I mean young kids, and feel perfectly safe. And their parents knew they were safe, because that was back in the time when the whole neighborhood looked out after everybody's kids.
Speaker 1: What was the overall makeup or racial makeup in Santa Barbara at that point? What were things like in, we'll say Greater Santa Barbara?
Speaker 2: Santa Barbara in many ways--and I didn't learn this until a lot later--it was unique, in that it was a Pacific paradise. And that is, it was just the perfect place to grow up. Now even though African Americans were a minority in those days, it wasn't an issue. And racial incidents were rare, extremely rare. It just seemed that people got along together, and maybe because it was just such a good place to live. I mean there was no tension, no strife. Everybody had sufficient--hell yeah, some people had more than others. We had our share of affluent people in Santa Barbara, but the people who had less didn't seem to be bothered by that, and everybody seemed to get along.
Story_ID: 465756
Speaker 1: Were there any particular, (cough) excuse me, any particular sights, sounds or smells that you can recall in the neighborhood [in Santa Barbara, California] at that time that really stand out in your mind?
Speaker 2: The neighborhood was full of sights and sounds of, you might say ethnic, of our ethnic diversity. Because I remember we had a lot of Mexican restaurants, and a Mexican bakery. I remember two streets up we had an Italian restaurant, and of course, the good old southern fried chicken that you would find there as well. So, we had this diverse group, and yet we never really saw ourselves as being all that different.
Story_ID: 465757
Speaker 1: Could you tell me about your first school you went to, your elementary school?
Speaker 2: My first school was Lincoln School [Santa Barbara, California], Lincoln elementary school, which was only a couple of blocks away from where I lived. So once again, in those days children walked to school. It was, I mean the idea of a school bus was so unusual back in those days, because every kid I knew simply walked to school, and some even walked home for lunch.
Speaker 1: Were there any teachers there that stood out in your mind, or that really influenced you in elementary school?
Speaker 2: I would say the teachers that probably I remember most would always be the music teachers or the art teachers, because that's where my interest was, you know.
Speaker 1: Do you recall any of their names?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no I do not; I wish I could. Not in elementary school. Junior high school [Santa Barbara Junior High School, Santa Barbara, California], that's when the memory kicks in. And I remember my music teacher in junior high school, Irving McGuire [ph.].
Speaker 1: We'll come up to that in one moment.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: What kind of student were you in elementary school?
Speaker 2: I don't think I was a very good student in elementary school. And I think that was because I was mainly distracted by my interest in art and music. It seemed, that's what I had on my mind. So I'll admit to being a rather--a student who was just not that attentive in class, because I was always drawing pictures. I got scolded about that many, many a time.
Speaker 1: So, what kind of child were you outside of your academics? Were you well-behaved? What kind of child do you think you were?
Speaker 2: I think I was a pretty mild-mannered child, you know. I was not that outgoing. My two brothers were [James Norman, Jr. and Oljay Norman] a good deal more gregarious than myself. I was more to myself. I would love to sit and read a book, or grab a sketchbook and draw. So, I would tend to keep pretty much to myself. So pretty laid back, you know, pretty calm.
Story_ID: 465758
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned your interest in music and art.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, when did these dreams and aspirations develop? What age, what's the earliest age you can recall sitting down and taking a pen to paper, or a pencil to paper, and saying, "Well, I like doing this."
Speaker 2: You know, I really can't remember when I started drawing, because it seems like I've been drawing from my earliest memory. My mother [Evelyn Davis Norman] used to joke that I used to draw on the walls when I was a kid. And because the drawings were pretty low to the floor, that meant I was (laughter) pretty young drawing on the walls. I guess I was being a tagger even back then, tagging my parents' walls in the house. And then eventually I began drawing in books, which I shouldn't have been doing, because these were (laughter) real books. And I would always have crayon marks in books, because any sheet of paper, I would grab a crayon and start to draw.
Speaker 1: So, it's kind of a real intrinsic thing for you?
Speaker 2: It was just a part of me, yeah. Drawing's always been a part of me.
Story_ID: 465759
Speaker 1: So, did your family attend church?
Speaker 2: Yes. My family attended the local church, once again, within walking distance from our home.
Speaker 1: Do you recall the name of that church?
Speaker 2: The A.M.E. Methodist Church [St. Paul A.M.E. Church], once again, on Haley [Street] and Olive Street, I believe, in Santa Barbara [California]. It's still there, the church is still there.
Speaker 1: What were your experiences there, going to church? Any special experiences there?
Speaker 2: The special experience in church has always been the music, always the music. And that's what I remember most. As a matter of fact, I began to incorporate these memories as a child into films that I made later that involved gospel singing. And I just, these images and sounds I put in films that I had made years later, where as a child I just remember the choir singing. And I remember how the people just were so into it, and had such a great time.
Story_ID: 465760
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned your artistic, your early artistic aspirations, being from a very young age?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: When did the music and what part of the music--outside of hearing it, what else did you participate in that made you enjoy music?
Speaker 2: Well, I couldn't sing, that's for sure. So I knew I didn't have that talent, but I could play music. And because my family was so involved in music--I mean my mother [Evelyn Davis Norman] played piano. My father [James Norman, Sr.] played the banjo. My [maternal] grandfather [John Davis, Sr.] played the mandolin. And of course my brothers, my older brother, Jimmie [James Norman, Jr.], was a very good pianist. And my younger brother, Wendell [Oljay Norman], was a great reed man. I mean he played everything. I mean he was very into jazz, so he played saxophone, clarinet, flute. But he also played classical. He played the bassoon, which is a fairly difficult instrument to master.
Speaker 1: A double reed instrument.
Speaker 2: Exactly, a double, double reed. Yeah, he played the bassoon. I remember he played a concert. He played a bassoon concerto, and now I've forgotten who composed that concerto. But I remember he, I remember him playing that with a full symphony orchestra. And I remember being so impressed that my younger brother could play the--maybe it was Mozart [Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart], the Mozart 'Bassoon Concerto.' But yeah, he was good, he was very good.
Story_ID: 465761
Speaker 1: So you have these two things running through your childhood--music and art at the same time?
Speaker 2: Music and art, that's correct.
Speaker 1: And then you go through elementary school [Lincoln School, Santa Barbara, California], you stayed there six years or so?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I believe we went to the sixth grade in elementary school.
Speaker 1: And then you went to junior high?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What was the name of that school?
Speaker 2: That was simply Santa Barbara Junior High School [Santa Barbara, California].
Speaker 1: And what was the divers- racial diversity of that school?
Speaker 2: Our junior high school was a pretty diverse mix. For the first time, we had a real mix of white students, Asian students, Latino, and African American. So it was a pretty, a pretty diverse mix in our junior high school. Once again, a great school, and just had a great time.
Speaker 1: Who were some of your friends there? Do you recall anybody in particular?
Speaker 2: Oh, by name? (Laughter) I had, I had many friends in junior high school. And boy, as you get older it's kind of hard to remember all the names. But I remember some of the kids that I played in the school orchestra with, Bill [William Simms] and John Simms [ph.], who still live in Santa Barbara [California] to this day by the way, Bill and John Sims. And Bennie Saunders [ph.], who was a wonderful saxophone player. But there were so many kids. Boy, you know, I'm thinking back now to junior high school, that's a long time ago. But I had a lot of friends. I had no shortage of friends, and with different interests, too. So, it was a great time.
Speaker 1: Now this is an age of influence, in the junior high school years. Who was most influencing you now at this time?
Speaker 2: I would think a primary influence in junior high school was my music teacher, Irving McGuire [ph.], who--really, when he came to Santa Barbara, and I was already in junior high school when Mr. McGuire arrived. He really wanted to transform not just the school band and orchestra, but I think he wanted to transform the school, because he even changed the school colors. Because prior to his arrival, our school colors were black and orange. (Laughter) Those are Halloween colors, and pretty ugly when you get right down to it. And McGuire said, "You know, these are ugly colors. School colors ought to be, you know, how about blue and white?" And so, he actually changed the school colors. But Irving McGuire is still alive. I went to his ninetieth birthday party this summer in Santa Barbara. And he's just as chipper as always, still playing in the orchestra, playing violin in the orchestra in Santa Barbara.
Speaker 1: Irving McGuire?
Speaker 2: Irving McGuire, yeah.
Speaker 1: Is he African American, or was he--?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, he's a white man. But he's a cool dude, you know. He's a guy--and even after I left school, I would still go back to Santa Barbara to play in orchestras with him, if he was conducting. And he would invite some of his former students to come back to Santa Barbara and play. You know, they would have these shows or plays in Santa Barbara, at the, at the County Bowl [sic. Santa Barbara Bowl, Santa Barbara, California] which is a venue for stage plays and musical events. And I was so delighted that my old music teacher would invite us back to play in the orchestra.
Speaker 1: Now what was your instrument again? You may have alluded to that earlier, but what was your--
Speaker 2: Oh, my instruments. I started out playing the violin terribly, (laughter) terribly. So I realized, well, this isn't working. So I switched to the saxophone, tenor saxophone. And then I began playing the clarinet, because I wanted to play in the dance bands, you know. In the big bands of those days, you had to play saxophone and clarinet to play in the band. And then eventually I picked up the flute, because that was a good instrument to, to know as well.
Story_ID: 465762
Speaker 1: So, during this time period you're playing in a band, which requires focus and attention?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you're sketching and drawing because it's so natural for you?
Speaker 2: I was sketching and drawing because I knew that I was going to be my career. I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, you already knew that then?
Speaker 2: I already knew that. I had, I had no doubt, even from a child, that my career would be in art, that I was going to be a professional artist. There was just no doubt about it, no, no doubt in my mind.
Speaker 1: So you--
Speaker 2: I played music because I simply enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: So in junior high school [Santa Barbara Junior High School, Santa Barbara, California], what were you doing artistically to hone your craft there, as far as art is concerned?
Speaker 2: As far as art in junior high school, probably no more than the other art--you know, the other students in the art class. I mean I was still drawing, still painting. I didn't see myself as being all that special or that much better than anybody else. I just knew that's what I wanted to do with my life.
Speaker 1: What were others saying about your art when they saw it at this time?
Speaker 2: I, I think the impression that I made with most of my fellow students was the fact that I liked to draw cartoons. For some reason I just had this natural gift for, I don't know, making fun of people, and making fun of situations.
Speaker 1: Were you an avid cartoon buff yourself at that point?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was a huge cartoon buff. I read comic books, I read comic strips. I was a fan of all of the strips of that era. Most of those are gone now, the strips like Dick Tracy, Al Capp's Li'l Abner, you know, strips that were big, big, you know, during that time, you know, in America. I mean, people used to read the comics. I mean, people would get the newspaper and turn to the comics page to see what Dick Tracy was doing, or what Li'l Abner was doing, you know, did Daisy Mae [Daisy Mae Scragg] catch him, you know, on Sadie Hawkins day? I don't think that happens anymore. I think people, (laughter) I don't think people even have any interest in comics today because of all the new media.
Speaker 1: Do you think that the comics possibly were a nice way of escaping a lot of things for people? Do you think it was a way of them--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --fantasizing a little bit at that time, without the television and--
Speaker 2: Yeah. Comics in the 1940s and '50s [1950s] that was the media of that era. I mean we didn't have--I mean television was new. People went to movies on occasion. We didn't have the Internet, just didn't have all this, all this new media. So, comics were very big.
Speaker 1: If my research serves me correctly, movies always had comics before, right? Was there (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, there would always be cartoons, right.
Speaker 1: Cartoons before--
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: --before the movie?
Speaker 2: Exactly. If you went to a movie theater, you were almost guaranteed to see a color cartoon from Disney [Walt Disney Studios, Burbank, California] or Warner Brothers [Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc.].
Story_ID: 465763
Speaker 1: So, you're going through junior high school. What age would you have been now? You're twelve or thirteen?
Speaker 2: I would be, boy, I can't remember. Probably twelve or thirteen.
Speaker 1: And you're getting ready to go to high school. What year did you enter high school?
Speaker 2: I entered high school in 1951, I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In 1951.
Speaker 1: And what high school was that?
Speaker 2: Once again, Santa Barbara High School [Santa Barbara, California] (laughter). The name's real simple, Santa Barbara High School. Santa Barbara [California] has more schools now. So now, we've got different names. But back in those days it was Santa Barbara Junior High [Santa Barbara Junior High School, Santa Barbara, California], and Santa Barbara High School. That was it.
Speaker 1: So now, you're in high school in 1951. Now what are those experiences like as you get into high school? Because now you're in the last haul of what we call our formative years of education.
Speaker 2: Right. Going to high school in 1951, once again, and I keep thinking about what an opportunity I had back in the 1950s. It really was for a lot of us like 'Happy Days,' almost like the TV series, in that there was so little turmoil, strife, pressure. I just had a great time in high school. And I talk to high school kids today, and maybe even a few years back, and they tell me what an awful time they had in high school. Or they'll talk about bad experiences. We had no, no gangs. We had no racial incidents. We didn't have fights. We didn't--everybody seemed to get along.
Speaker 1: So, your experience as a student in 1951 in Santa Barbara might be very different from that of a student in Little Rock [Arkansas], or somewhere else?
Speaker 2: Totally, yeah.
Speaker 1: During those times.
Speaker 2: Totally, yeah. My experiences in Santa Barbara, like I said, we were just an odd place, I mean a wonderful place. But Santa Barbara was unique in that we seemed to be free of the strife that the rest of the nation was suffering. I think it was because we were a small community, a small, tight-knit community with families that seemed to have no other interest than, you know, trying to live their lives as best they could, and educate their children. And everybody got along. I mean whites, Asians, Latinos, African Americans. Nobody fought anybody, you know. (Laughter) Nobody--there was no such thing as carrying guns or knives to school, it was unheard of. As a matter of fact, the worst thing that happened some student, a couple of kids got, you know would be involved in a fist fight. And that would be a scandal, you know, it would be horrific.
Story_ID: 465764
Speaker 1: So, you're now in Santa Barbara High School [Santa Barbara, California]. And you're getting older now, you're in your teens.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You said the experiences were quite, as we say, mellow during that time. Everything was really good for you there.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Who were your teachers, and who was influencing you at this point?
Speaker 2: At Santa Barbara High School?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well, let me think. Number one, we go back to art and music. My art teacher, my journalism teacher as well. What was her name? Oh, dear. Anyway, she was in charge of the school newspaper, and that's when I got involved with the school paper. It's called The Forge, as I recall now, The Forge. And then oddly enough, the journalism instructor ended up marrying my music teacher (laughter) some years later. His name was Henry Brubeck, and he was quite a character. Henry Brubeck had a brother you've probably heard of.
Speaker 1: Dave Brubeck?
Speaker 2: Dave Brubeck, right, right. And we were, of course, as kids and jazz buffs, we were huge fans of Dave Brubeck. And anytime Dave would come to town, it would be so special, you know. And the fact that his brother was our music teacher was just really cool.
Story_ID: 465765
Speaker 1: Now during the, your high school years, there's a name that comes up, Bill Woggon.
Speaker 2: Bill Woggon, right.
Speaker 1: Tell us about that experience. Now you're in--still in high school [Santa Barbara High School, Santa Barbara, California] when this association with him begins?
Speaker 2: This ties into high school very much. My biology teacher, Jacob Turner [ph.], played golf out at the Montecito Country Club [Santa Barbara, California] every Wednesday with a gentleman named Bill Woggon. And Bill Woggon, as it turns out, was a cartoonist. Lived out in Mission Canyon [California], and had a ranch that he named Woggon Wheels Ranch (laughter). That's a wacky name. And Mr. Turner said, "You know what? There's a kid in my science class who's never paying attention to his studies. He's always drawing cartoons." And Bill Woggon said, "Well, you know, you ought to send him out to see me. I can, perhaps I can use him as an assistant." So that was my introduction to Bill Woggon, it came through my, my science teacher in high school. So, one afternoon I drove out to Mission Canyon to the Woggon Wheels Ranch to meet this gentlemen, Bill Woggon. And sure enough, he gave me a job while still in high school as his assistant.
Speaker 1: What grade would you have been in at this point?
Speaker 2: Probably the eleventh grade, probably a junior in high school.
Speaker 1: Now, what is Bill Woggon known for?
Speaker 2: Bill Woggon worked for Archie Comics [Archie Comic Publications, Inc.]. Back, back in the 1950s, Archie Comics was very big. They did 'Wilbur' ['Wilbur Comics'] and as well as the 'Archie Comics,' and they had a few other titles, I just can't remember now. But one title they published was 'Katy Keene,' "Katy Keene, the fashion queen," and that was a comic book that was drawn and written by Bill Woggon. And one of the things that was unique about 'Katy Keene' was it was interactive. You know, for its day, it was an interactive comic book. That is, Bill allowed his readers to participate. He let the girls send in fashion designs for Katy's wardrobe. And then Bill and his artists would take those designs drawn by the children and incorporate those designs into the comic stories and give the kids credit. The boys were not left out. The boys could design cars, airplanes, whatever, you know. And so the boys had a chance to jump in and do their thing as well, and then they would get a credit in the comic book. Well, it just thrilled them. Because imagine as a kid designing something, and then seeing your name in print and knowing that kids all over the U.S., you know, have seen your design and your name in, in a comic book.
Speaker 1: Now, let's re-visit your science teacher. Do you think teachers had a knack back in the day of realizing, okay, maybe he won't be a chemist.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But I do see that he has--do you think that was a trend that happened during those times, where they could see--
Speaker 2: Oh, very much so. I think that the teachers when I was going to high school were much more involved in their individual students, number one, because the classes were smaller. So, each student would get more personal attention. So therefore my science teacher, Mr. Turner, certainly recognized that even though I might not be a science wiz, (laughter) I apparently had some talent in another area. And then he brought that to the attention of Bill. So, you know, that's just the way things worked in those days.

Speaker 1: So, you go out, you got out to the Woggon Wheel?
Speaker 2: Woggon Wheels Ranch [Mission Canyon, California], yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you meet this man. And what does he tell you? What does he say to you?
Speaker 2: Well, number one, he was kind of a character. He was kind of an odd looking dude. I mean he was from back east. He had always fancied himself a cowboy. And so he left the east, moved out west, you know, and bought this ranch. Now, his brother was also a cartoonist. I believe his older brother, Elmer Woggon, did a comic strip called Steve Roper and Big Chief Wahoo [sic. Chief Wahoo and Steve Roper; Steve Roper and Mike Nomad]. And it was very big in the, I think late '40s [1940s] and early '50s [1950s]. So even the Woggons, they had their place in the comics world. But Bill [Bill Woggon] fancied himself a cowboy. And so when I met him out at the ranch, here he was, you know, at the drawing table. But he was wearing cowboy boots and had the cowboy hat, and then the plaid shirt. And he had the horses down in the corral. And this was really quite interesting for a high school kid, to meet this character. But he was very engaging, he was a very enthusiastic, almost bombastic gentleman, and just really nice. And apparently he saw that I had something, and he gave me the opportunity to work for him as his assistant.
Speaker 1: Now, was this a paid internship?
Speaker 2: This was a paid job, yeah. It didn't pay a lot, but, boy, it was sure a lot better than doing a lot of other jobs around town. And besides, I was working on a real honest-to-goodness comic book. So, it was like my first professional job in comics.
Speaker 1: What was your job description as his assistant?
Speaker 2: My job description was doing all the things that nobody else wanted to do, and that is all the munda- mundane tasks of doing a comic book. You know, somebody has to do the borders, you know, that line the comic panels, you know. You've got to draw those, and incidental things like drawing the scenics, you know, the buildings in the background, the cars, you know, and then the panels--I mean the balloons that go into panels that hold the dialogue, and things like that. That was my early task as a young assistant. And as time went on then I would be given more things to do, until I finally got to the point that I was allowed to actually pencil and ink comic pages on my own.
Speaker 1: What was the mentorship like? What kind of things did he tell you about your art? And what did you learn from him?
Speaker 2: Well, number one, when you, when you start out as a kid and you're on your first professional job--Bill was a real mentor, as well as his staff, too. Because he had people who worked with him in the studio there on the ranch, and some darn good artists who were involved in the comic book as well. And they took me under their wing, and I served my apprenticeship learning from them. One of the things that the other artists made me aware of was that I needed to go to art school, and I really hadn't thought a good deal about that. And they said, "Yeah, you need to go to art school. You really need--if you're going to be a professional, you're going to have to hone your craft, and you're going to have to learn, you know, the basics, the fundamentals." And there were a number of art schools in Los Angeles [California], but they recommended the Art Center School [ArtCenter College of Design, Pasadena, California], because they said that was one of the finest schools in the country.
Speaker 1: So, what does your mom [Evelyn Davis Norman] and dad [James Norman, Sr.] say about your new job and your proposed career, them being very hard workers probably in traditional jobs?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What were they saying about this art career?
Speaker 2: My mom and dad were totally behind me, my [maternal] grandmother [Emma Davis] even more so. Once again, they wanted me to have a greater opportunity in life than they had. They knew I had this ability to draw and paint. They knew that I was just almost obsessed with it. So, no, they were very supportive, and they were very happy for me that I scored my first job with Bill Woggon and learned the comic book biz, although I knew that eventually I'd have to leave this ideal job and head off to art school.
Story_ID: 465767
Speaker 1: So now, you're, you're working for Bill Woggon. You're in high school [Santa Barbara High School, Santa Barbara, California], and you're probably still doing a little bit of music?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: How else was your time spent with other activities? What else were you doing?
Speaker 2: My time was spent almost totally with the things I loved doing, and that is working on the school newspaper [The Forge] because I loved that aspect. These were all things that were going to play a part in my life as an adult. I mean, I can see myself now in high school. The things I was involved with all connected to what I would be doing professionally.
Speaker 1: What was your function on the school newspaper?
Speaker 2: I was the cartoonist. I did, I did the comic strip in the school newspaper.
Speaker 1: Was it your own design? Was it your own input totally?
Speaker 2: It was my own, I could do whatever I wanted. It was my own characters, my own gags, my own ideas.
Speaker 1: Do you recall the name of it?
Speaker 2: No, because mainly I didn't have a character. I would just tend to pick situations around the school. Sometimes I would choose a student, like I might choose the star football player and do a comic strip about him. So I kind of made it up as I went along.
Speaker 1: Did you ever get any repercussions from people about using them as an object of the paper?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No, everybody loved it, everybody loved it. People were actually flattered that you would choose them and do a comic about them. It was a real compliment.
Story_ID: 465768
Speaker 1: So at this point you knew that you were going to be a professional artist; you knew that beyond a shadow of a doubt. You also knew that you had to go to art school.
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you'd been told that by people who you considered your mentors.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Then what happened upon graduation? You graduated in sixty- oh no, I'm sorry--
Speaker 2: Oh, in fifty- in '53 [1953].
Speaker 1: In '53 [1953], you graduated?
Speaker 2: That's correct, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. So high school [Santa Barbara High School, Santa Barbara, California] was only three years for you?
Speaker 2: High school was three years, and a very exciting three years. Because as I said before, everything I did in high school was kind of a foreshadowing of what I would do professionally. While in high school, I fell in love with theater. I was always involved in the school plays, because I was generally in the orchestra pit playing in the orchestra. Because I just loved that whole theatrical aspect of, you know, of high school, and the high school plays and the musical events. I was involved with the school newspaper because I knew I would be headed in that direction. I was involved with music, and I was involved in art. So--
Speaker 1: There was very little idle time for you?
Speaker 2: No, and I even played in a dance band. We played for dances on Friday nights. I was involved in a big band called the Music Makers [ph.], and we played for the school dances on Friday nights after the big football game. So, again, you know, my high school years were just years of just good times, and learning and growing, and again, foreshadowing what I would do in my career. So I was, I was totally into high school, I loved it. Most people tell me how much they hated high school. I loved high school.
Story_ID: 465769
Speaker 1: Now, the end is coming for high school [Santa Barbara High School, Santa Barbara, California] in 1953.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What happens to you next now?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-three [1953], I graduated from high school. And no less than about a week later I headed south for an interview at the Walt Disney Studio [Walt Disney Studios, Burbank, California], because I knew that's where I wanted to go.
Speaker 1: So you skipped--school wasn't a, you hadn't decided on what school to go to next yet? You hadn't decided what college (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's correct. I hadn't decided where life would take me after high school. And maybe I was a little over-anxious to jumpstart my career. So--
Speaker 1: So you had an interview at Walt Disney?
Speaker 2: Right. I went down to the Walt Disney Studio one Saturday morning and had a meeting with a gentleman named Ken Seeling, who was the head of the personnel department. And I took a portfolio of my sketches, my cartoon sketches. And it was a very exciting time, because I had never been inside the Disney Studio before in my life. So I felt like I had entered this wonderland, you know. I said, "Oh, I'm finally here."
Speaker 1: Being a Saturday, was it occupied, or was it pretty much you and him?
Speaker 2: No, that Saturday the studio was closed. The studio was pretty much closed on Saturday, so there was nobody around.
Speaker 1: Could you still see all the tables, the art tables, and basically things in progress?
Speaker 2: I couldn't see a great deal, because the studio was essentially closed over the weekend. But I did get a chance to wander the hallways and look at all the great art on the wall; I saw all of this. And this was the real--this was not reproductions. It was the real art. This was art that I had seen as a child in movies, you know, as a kid. I'm looking at the real thing, the real deal. And boy, was that exciting.
Speaker 1: So Mr. Seeling is there, and he sees your, sees your portfolio?
Speaker 2: Mr. Seeling looks at my portfolio, and he says, "Kid, you got talent. But what I would recommend is you go to art school and develop this talent." So, I knew deep down that he was correct.
Speaker 1: You've heard it twice by now.
Speaker 2: I've heard it twice now, yeah, yeah. So I began to make plans to go to art school. And the school chose was the Art Center School in Los Angeles [California], because it was, by all the people I talked to, you know, the finest school, you know, one of the finest in the country.
Speaker 1: So you, did you have to audition for the school? Or did you just enroll? What was the process?
Speaker 2: I believe there was somewhat of an audition process, where you would have to submit your work to see if you would be acceptable for the Art Center [ArtCenter College of Design, Pasadena, California]. Fortunately, I was accepted as a student in the fall of 1953, and I began my, what was going to be a four-year course at the Art Center School.
Story_ID: 465770
Speaker 1: So now you're in the Art Center School [ArtCenter College of Design, Pasadena, California]. And you've come a long way. You've been drawing for a long time now, all your life pretty much, as far as you know it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes. Yes, I had.
Speaker 1: Now, you're in the school. So now does music, is music starting to subside now because it's getting a little bit more serious for you?
Speaker 2: Right, I kind of left music behind. When I enrolled at Art Center, sadly, that part of my life had to be kind of like put on hold, because now the focus was on learning how to draw, how to paint. And it was an awakening for me because keep in mind that in high school [Santa Barbara High School, Santa Barbara, California], I guess I was pretty hot stuff, you know. Myself and a few others were like the top talent in the school. And so, you know, you think you're pretty good. I came to Art Center, and I realized I was nothing. (Laughter) I was a novice, I was a beginner. I couldn't even approach the level of work that I saw on the walls from the other students, not professionals, from the other students, that just blew me away. And I realized I had a lot to learn.
Speaker 1: So, were you inspired to learn more at that point?
Speaker 2: I was humbled initially (laughter); humbled and then inspired, yeah.
Speaker 1: Describe some of your interactions with those upperclassmen or people, or teachers at the school.
Speaker 2: I had a great deal of respect for my upperclassmen at Art Center, because they were darn good students, they were talented.
Speaker 1: Do you recall anybody of note that you might want to mention?
Speaker 2: Certain artists? Guy Deel was one student who was a very talented illustrator, who oddly enough, years later I worked with at Disney [Walt Disney Studios, Burbank, California]. But I remember Guy Deel, who became an accomplished illustrator. There were guys like Don, Don Putman [Donald Putman], who is another talented illustrator who went on to a fantastic career as an illustrator. The names kind of escape me now, but there were so many talented people going to Art Center at that time. And so--oh, another name, Ralph McQuarrie, another great guy, Ralph McQuarrie. I remember sitting next to him in class and being amazed at how well this guy could draw and paint, you know, a fellow student. He went on to design all of that great stuff for George Lucas for 'Star Wars.' If you think back to 1977, those early illustrations that you saw for Lucas' 'Star Wars,' that was all Ralph McQuarrie. He designed all of the spaceships and the alien landscapes, and all of that stuff. He was a classmate of mine, Ralph McQuarrie, yeah.
Speaker 1: So now you're in the school, and your skills--do you see and feel yourself developing as an artist now, because of what you're learning?
Speaker 2: Definitely, yeah, yeah. It was hard work. As a matter of fact, they warned us at the orientation at Art Center. They said, "We want all of you young students to know that Art Center's going to be hard work." And they kept their word. It was hard work, and it wasn't, it wasn't a school where you just sort of breezed your way through. They insisted that the students apply themselves and work hard. And if you didn't--oh, boy, you sure caught it if you didn't work hard.
Speaker 1: Now, how many African American students were at Art Center in 1953?
Speaker 2: I would say a total of three.
Speaker 1: Do you recall all the names of the three, including yourself? Because you were one of the three (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I was, (laughter) I was one of the three.
Speaker 1: So, there's two more.
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Floyd Norman, a talented painter named Bill Butler [ph.], and a young woman whose name I don't recall.
Story_ID: 465771
Speaker 1: Now, you're out of the safe haven of, of Santa Barbara [California]. Now you're in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] in the '50s [1950s].
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Are things a little bit different now racially? Are you starting to see some things that are a little bit different?
Speaker 2: Los Angeles in the '50s [1950s] was--when I think back to it now, compared to Santa Barbara, it was a lot bigger. Everything was just bigger, louder, you know. (Laughter) I'm now in the big city. And of course, that was quite a shock from my little world in Santa Barbara. So I had to get used to that, and it took me a while. Even going to school, I had to travel all the way across town. I took the Red Car [Pacific Electric Railway], the Red Car still ran back in those days. You know, sadly, all that was dismantled. But for a few coins, you could ride all the way across town on the Red Car. Try doing that today (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did you run into any racial problems now in the city?
Speaker 2: No, no, there were no racial problems. Once again, this was the 1950s. Things were still pretty mellow. Problems didn't start to heat up until the next decade. The '60s [1960s] would bring a good deal of turmoil, with the Watts riots.
Speaker 1: So in the school [Art Center School; ArtCenter College of Design, Pasadena, California], you had--in the school there was no, there was no, "Why are you all here?"
Speaker 2: No, no. The funny thing about art and music, it's funny. People involved in art and music are just very accepting of each other, of diversity. I mean you don't even think about the artists whose sitting next to you being Asian or Latino or Jewish, or whatever. You don't even, it doesn't come to mind. He or she is just another artist.
Story_ID: 465772
Speaker 1: So, you're at the Art Center [Art Center School; ArtCenter College of Design, Pasadena, California] for four years?
Speaker 2: No, actually only two years.
Speaker 1: Two years?
Speaker 2: Because there's an interruption.
Speaker 1: What happens?
Speaker 2: In my third year--
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty-four [1954] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Late '55 [1955], I think.
Speaker 1: Fifty-five [1955].
Speaker 2: I get a phone call from Mr. Seeling from the Walt Disney Studio [Walt Disney Studios, Burbank, California], the man that I had talked to two years earlier. And he said, "Floyd [HistoryMaker Floyd Norman], we're starting up this animation class of animation apprentices. What do you think? Do you want to be a part of that class? We've got an opening." Well, there was, I had to make a decision. Do I return to school? Or do I bail out and head out to Disney?
Speaker 1: That probably wasn't a big decision for you (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Probably not. Yeah, I bailed out. I bailed out of school. And I said, you know what? I'm just going to continue my education at Disney. It's not that I'm stopping my education, I'm just going to continue it at a different location.
Speaker 1: On the job training?
Speaker 2: On the job training, exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay, so now you tell everybody adios at the school?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you move into--so you go to Disney, which is where you wanted to be now?
Speaker 2: In the first place, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you find it surprising that Mr.--what did you say his name was? Seeling?
Speaker 2: Ken Seeling, yes.
Speaker 1: That he had jotted your name down and kept you on the file all these years? Two years is a long time in the personnel department.
Speaker 2: I know, I know. And that impressed me to no end, the fact that two years later he still remembered my name, he still hadn't forgotten me--the fact that I was still in the file, you know, and not in the circular file (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you take the job?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you're in an apprentice program?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: How many were in this program?
Speaker 2: There were about seven or eight of us. And the way things worked in those days--and the animation business, it's not like any normal business. It tends to run hot and cold, up and down. If there's, if there's a need for artists, then the call goes out, "We need more artists." If there's not a need, then the studio contracts and has layoffs and cutbacks. That's just part of the entertainment business. I guess it's always been that way. So, what happened was all of a sudden Disney had this huge influx of work, you know. All of a sudden Disney had just moved into television. They were doing feature films, and they had all of this stuff going. They were working on this theme park [Disneyland] out in Anaheim [California], so there was just a sudden demand for more artists. So, therefore they began to, "Okay, we need more talent," and they began to look through the files and start calling. "Who's available? Who's out there?" And lucky for me, I was one of the names they called.
Speaker 1: So the apprenticeship program, how long was that to run for you?
Speaker 2: The apprenticeship program, the way it worked back then, it ran for about a month. You had about thirty days to prove yourself worthy of being an employee of The Walt Disney Company [Walt Disney Productions; The Walt Disney Company, Burbank, California]. So what they did, they brought you in and they put all of us in a large room, all eight of us, and we would sit there drawing all day. And on occasion we would have lectures from the other Disney veterans. And they would show us Disney films, and they would tell us what made Disney different or unique from, you know, the other studios. And after that thirty days, if you had shown yourself worthy, if you had met their requirements, then you were actually brought on as a full-time employee. Lucky for all of us, our entire group made it.
Speaker 1: Can you give us an example, of economically, of what that meant back in the day, at Disney in those days, what that meant?
Speaker 2: Okay. When they brought us in as apprentices, we made about forty dollars a week.
Speaker 1: In 1955, that was--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that wasn't--you could get by on that, you know. It wasn't much, but you could get by on forty dollars a week. If you made the cut, then your salary jumped up to around sixty or seventy dollars a week. And then every six months or so you would be bumped higher, as you proved yourself on the job.
Story_ID: 465773
Speaker 1: So here you are, a young man now, fifty- you're about twenty-one years old, twenty, twenty-one years old now?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think I would be about twenty.
Speaker 1: You made the cut.
Speaker 2: Made the cut (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you- and you're a full time employee of Disney [Walt Disney Studios, Burbank, California]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Could you tell us the first time you actually saw Walt Disney, or had any conversation with him?
Speaker 2: Well, keep in mind, back in those days the Disney artists, and especially the Disney veterans, the top guys, you wouldn't have any dealings with them at all. You know, it's almost like--you think in terms of the [U.S.] military, and you've got this hierarchy. And you're kind of like a private, you know, with no stripes, and these guys are like officers. So, you don't even talk to them. You might see them in the hallway, but they are so far above you in so many ways. I mean, because we looked at these old guys with such admiration. I mean, they'd been making these films for the past twenty, thirty years, films that we had seen as a child.
Speaker 1: 'Steamboat Willie' and all those things.
Speaker 2: All of that. 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,' 'Pinocchio,' 'Fantasia,' all of these, you know, classic Disney films. These were the people who had made these films. I mean they were gifted, talented artists. So, we were in awe of them. So even if you saw them, you would just sort of like, you know, sort of stand back as they walk by, and say, "Wow, that's Mr. So and So." But I can tell you the first time I saw Walt Disney, because that memory is still with me.
Speaker 1: How long had you been at Disney when this occurred?
Speaker 2: We'd been at Disney probably two weeks. And as was part of our routine, we were called upstairs to attend a screening in one of the projection rooms on the second floor, the third floor in this case, the third floor of the animation building.
Speaker 1: And where was this located? Where was Disney located, the offices?
Speaker 2: The Disney Studio is located in the San Fernando Valley in Burbank; Burbank, California.
Speaker 1: So you went there, and you go to a screening?
Speaker 2: We're going to a screening because usually a couple of times a week we would go upstairs into one of the large screening rooms to watch some Disney films.
Speaker 1: Do you recall what the film was?
Speaker 2: Oh, I have no memory of what the film was. But it was a Disney, either a short cartoon or maybe a Disney feature. But they called us upstairs. And we waited in the hallway, because the room was in use and whoever it was inside hadn't finished their business yet. So they told us all, you know, you guys just wait here in the hallway. So we just stood there in the hallway, waiting outside the projection room. Well, if you look down at the far end of the hallway, we heard the doors of an elevator open. And a figure steps out into the hallway and begins walking towards us. Now keep in mind, there's a large window at this end of the building. So, the figure is in silhouette, you can't really see who it is.
Speaker 1: Sunlight blocking him--
Speaker 2: He's backlit, and you just see this figure moving towards you. And as he gets closer and closer, we realize, oh, my goodness, that's Walt Disney. That's Walt Disney coming towards us. And all of us kids just sort of backed against the wall as Walt Disney walked past. And I tell people, you know, I tell the kids today, it was like Moses descending from the mount, you know. (Laughter) Because it was, it was our first sighting of Walt Disney. And the man was already like a living legend, you know. And to see him--you know, we'd seen him on television, you know, that kind of thing, but we'd never seen the man Walt Disney in the flesh. And so when Walt walked past, we were just all kind of like (laughter), like these star-struck kids, you know, just totally amazed that we're--yeah.
Story_ID: 465774
Speaker 1: So, the icon, the name on the building.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: The name on the paychecks.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's correct.
Speaker 1: The name that you've seen as a little boy in your [maternal] grandmother's [Emma Davis] books and your mother's [Evelyn Davis Norman] books--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --is now standing or walking past you?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Does he acknowledge his group of young interns?
Speaker 2: He smiled; I think he was amused by our behavior. I think Walt Disney knew who he was, and he knew the impact that he had had on American culture. He knew that he was a name and a face that was known at that time, now throughout the world. So, he was aware of his celebrity. But Walt, being kind of like a normal kind of, just a regular kind of guy--basically a farm boy from Missouri--didn't take himself all that seriously. And I think he was often amused at how some people seemed to regard him with awe, you know.
Speaker 1: Would it be fair to say that time kind of stood still for you all for a moment when that--
Speaker 2: It did, indeed. Yeah, it did. You know, we were all young, we were all kids, and we were there at the Walt Disney Studios [Burbank, California] because we so wanted to work for Walt Disney.
Speaker 1: So, basically he just walked past and kept walking to where he was going, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, he was headed, he was headed to his office.
Speaker 1: And so what was the con- little conversation among you as he walked past? Was it a--
Speaker 2: Oh, there was silence when he walked past (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Nobody uttered a word (laughter).
Speaker 1: And then afterwards, did you all kind of chatter about it?
Speaker 2: Oh, sure, there was a buzz after that. Like, "Did you--that was Walt Disney, yeah, yeah." It was that kind of a buzz. But no one even had the nerve to say good morning. I mean because somebody could have said, you know, "Good morning, Mr. Disney," or something. But no one even had the courage to even open their mouths. So--
Speaker 1: So you're at Disney now two weeks. And you stay there and you're learning the, learning the craft from the, from the seasoned veterans around there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 1: And I'm sure a lot of it's by osmosis, are they directly teaching you things? Or are you learning by example?
Speaker 2: A bit of both. We had instructors who would actually come to our office and work with us. We had the veterans who would lecture about the, you know, the basics. And we had, we had--being in that environment where you could almost just absorb that Disney creative spirit, because it's all around you. And I recall just wandering from office to office, just looking at the drawing boards and just being amazed at the level of work that was on the drawing tables.
Story_ID: 465775
Speaker 1: So, now you're an employee for Disney [Walt Disney Studios, Burbank, California].
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you're a young man and living in Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How's your personal life? What's going on? Because now you're somebody that has a quote, unquote good job now.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: You're African American, you work for Disney, which is probably unheard of.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you're the only one.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And this is the '50s [1950s]. And what's going on with you now socially and personally?
Speaker 2: I think the sad thing about a lot of artists, and maybe it happens to musicians as well, is that we sometimes don't have much of a personal life. I think the art tends to consume us, and it's our focus. And so I really didn't think much about life, you know, when I left the studio, except just to get back to work the next day. You know, our work kind of consumes us. And in a way that's bad, because you really need to have a balanced life. Eventually when I did marry, I think I became a much more balanced person. Because that's why we tend to get that title geek, you know, because they refer to us as animation geeks; that is, fan boys who have no life.
Speaker 1: Well, we'll go into you meeting your wife [Bell Mann (ph.)] and that the art stuff later on (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure, sure.
Speaker 1: Later on we'll get into that.
Story_ID: 465776
Speaker 1: But, so now you're at Disney [Walt Disney Studios, Burbank, California]. How long were you there before your first, we'll say, major assignment comes up?
Speaker 2: Major assignments? Well, you sort of move through this process of learning and growing through different projects, different films. I would say my major assignment didn't come until the 1960s when I got tagged to go into Disney's story department. Now, keep in mind that story at Disney was the place everybody wanted to be, almost everybody. There were guys continually submitting ideas, scripts, storyboards, just ideas for stories, because everybody wanted to work in story. And Walt Disney himself, this was the main area that Disney focused on, was storytelling. Well, I didn't have any interest in that, really. Oddly enough, I didn't have any interest in story. I wanted to be just the animator; that was my goal. And everything I did was to try to grow and learn to be an accomplished animator. However, sometimes your life takes unexpected turns. And one day my boss calls me in the office and he says, "You're gonna go upstairs to story." And I had no idea why, no idea. I didn't want the job, I didn't ask for the job. I was literally sent to Disney's story department. Well, that really did change my life and changed my career, because it sent me off in a whole new direction.
Speaker 1: Was it a lateral move, or was it a pay raise to go to story?
Speaker 2: It was a pay raise, but mainly it was a move up through the hierarchy, because story at Disney was considered one of the top jobs.
Speaker 1: What did the other seven say when they heard that you were going to story--in your class?
Speaker 2: Oh, the other seven, my other colleagues, they had all found their place. Some had moved on, and some had even left the studio by that time. Keep in mind, this was the 1960s when I finally made the move to story.
Speaker 1: So, you had been there maybe about ten years or so (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I had been there nearly ten years, yeah, working in animation.
Story_ID: 465777
Speaker 1: So, we're at, we're at about 1965 now?
Speaker 2: Sixty-five [1965], yeah.
Speaker 1: Somewhere thereabouts?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, the heat has been on racially.
Speaker 2: Ah, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In '65 [1965] things are going on. We've had assassin- a couple of assassinations with Dr.--
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: We've had John Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy], we've had Malcolm X.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you're, you're in a pred- you're the, you're, you're an African American, the one there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Was there any nicknames or anything that you received for being there? I read somewhere that they called you the Lone Negro.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's Charlie Shows [Charles Shows], who's a writer at Disney [Walt Disney Studios, Burbank, California]. As a matter of fact I have his book upstairs, which is entitled 'Walt' ['Walt: Backstage Adventures with Walt Disney,' Charles Shows], where he writes about his experiences at the Disney Studio. And in one chapter of his book, he remarks that there were very few minorities at the Disney Studio. And he refers to me as the lone Negro not because that was a title, but because I was the only African American he'd ever seen in the art department. And so, my friends kind of gave me that tag after a while. They began calling me the Lone Negro, (laughter) like it was some kind of a western.
Story_ID: 465778
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Now, let's take a--talk about this story assignment as you move through the story assignment (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now let's also give your take--because people have said in later years--they talked about the racial, the racial divide at Disney [Walt Disney Studios, Burbank, California], and things of this nature. A lot of times 'Song of the South' is used--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --as a reason to cast a negative light on Disney.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: They said that Walt Disney was a racist, and things of this nature.
Speaker 1: Yeah, anti-Semitic, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And we just, and you know, and we really--in the research we found out that unless you had priviness to--you had been privy to see the film--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --no one's ever really seen the film--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in its entirety--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in this country.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: So, let's talk about your experience right there with management. Because you're there in story, now I think your first assignment was one I remember as a kid seeing, was 'The Jungle Book.'
Speaker 1: 'The Jungle Book,' yeah, that was the film that I was sent to, yeah.
Speaker 2: And I, if I'm correct, this was the last movie that Walt Disney personally was the supervisor of?
Speaker 1: His last film, that's correct.
Speaker 2: Now, your interaction now in story is much different. You have a lot more weight assigned to you now, as far as your career is concerned, right?
Speaker 1: (Nods head).
Speaker 2: And are you working with him more now?
Speaker 1: It just--working in the Disney story department means that for the first time you get to be in meetings with Walt Disney. Keep in mind that Disney rarely interacted with his other departments, and that was mainly because he didn't have to. I mean, these guys were at the top of their game. His animation department, his background department, his layout guys, they were all top-notch, and Walt knew that. He didn't have to worry about them doing their work properly.
Speaker 2: So, he didn't micro-manage that?
Speaker 1: He didn't have to micro-manage. However, story was a different, was a different thing altogether. Story, for Walt, was everything. And so that's, that's where he focused his attention. So if you were in the story department that meant you were going to be there with the old man himself.
Speaker 2: Let's talk about your first meeting. You're here, and they tell you that you're in story now?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: You're kind of ambivalent, because you really, you know, you're an animator, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And now here you are in story.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Did you think you could do the job, or were you somewhat apprehensive about your own abilities?
Speaker 1: That's very funny. As I look back on that now, I'm almost amazed at the fact that I felt no pressure at all. Now, I'm thinking I should have been under a lot of pressure, because now I'm in the story department; I'm in this coveted position that a lot of guys have tried to get this job and were turned away. And a job I didn't even ask for, here I am a story artist, you know.
Speaker 2: And not necessarily trained in that direction, either, right?
Speaker 1: Well, all that stuff, I absorbed. Because I knew animation, and I knew every phase of animation. I knew every job. I knew what that job entailed. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean I could do that job, but I certainly understood it. So, it wasn't anything that was beyond my understanding. So when I was sent to story, I knew exactly what the job was. I didn't particularly want to do it, but I didn't have any--you know, I didn't not want to do it. So, when I went to story and I was given that assignment, I knew what to do pretty much.
Speaker 2: Who was your direct supervisor? Do you recall their name?
Speaker 1: My direct supervisor was a guy that, who I would call my mentor. And he was a guy a few years older than myself, a talented story man named Vance Gerry. And he and I worked in the same office, in the sense--the way story guys worked in those days, you would have two desks kind of like shoved together. I'd be on one side and Vance would be on the other. Now, the reason the story guys worked this way was because they could bounce ideas off of each other. Now, because Vance had been around a while, he knew the ropes, he knew what to do. So if I had any questions, Vance would be there to answer my questions.
Speaker 2: So the office was kind of feng shui back then, so you could get the right vibe going?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. And plus I had just the perfect mentor, because I often called Vance the mellowest man in the universe. This was a guy that nothing seemed to faze him. He just sort of just, he was just cool and mellow and laid-back. And when I would say, "Well, Vance, how do I do this particular thing?" He'd say, he would just say, "Oh, don't worry about it. Just do it and make it funny," you know. But you know, no pressure, no heat. Now keep in mind, we were going to have to pitch this stuff to the boss himself, to Walt Disney. And yet, we never really felt the heat, at least I sure didn't. Now maybe I was too dumb to feel the heat, but I just went about my job and just sort of did what I had to do, and enjoyed doing it. Probably I did a better job because I wasn't worried about it.
Story_ID: 465779
Speaker 1: Well, let's run a side bar for a moment also as we're doing this (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: And let's step outside of Disney [Walt Disney Studios, Burbank, California].
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: There's all sorts of things going on racially now, across the country.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you're doing, basically you're living in a fantasy world, so to speak.
Speaker 2: Oh, you bet, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: A fantasy world. Are you being chided by those who are like calling you--are you being called anything yourself? Are they saying, "Brother, we got a problem out here in the streets, and you're writing," you know. Was there any of that kind of stuff in your life? Because, of course you said you didn't interact a lot.
Speaker 2: Well, that's, that's true. Well, probably very few African Americans even knew that I worked for Disney. You know, people knew that I went to work every day. I think a lot of people had no idea what I did. They probably didn't even know that I worked for the Disney Studio. Sure, there was turmoil, you know, there was stuff going on in the streets. But most of the questions came from inside Disney, where other Disney artists would say, "You know, what's going on out there?" Or, "Why are these people rioting?" And, "What do they want?" And I always had an easy answer for them. I would say, "You know what they want? Exactly what you want, as simple as that. That's what they want." Because they couldn't figure out--you know, during the Watts riots that was a constant question that people would come to me in Disney and say, "Why are these people rioting? What do they want?" And--
Speaker 1: It's interesting, because now you're the, you're the creator of fantasy--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --for the world.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But also the purveyor of information for the reality--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that was going on, for the inside, for the people in Disney?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. And I didn't stay in fantasyland, because my partner, Leo Sullivan, and Dick Allen, who was a former L.A. [Los Angeles, California] policeman who attended the USC film school [University of Southern California School of Cinema-Television; University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts, Los Angeles, California] because he wanted to get into motion pictures, we took our cameras and we hit the streets.
Speaker 1: During your time at Disney?
Speaker 2: During my time, I was still employed by Disney. And we hit the streets with two Bolex 16mm cameras and photographed the Watts riots.
Speaker 1: The Watts riots occurred in '65 [1965]?
Speaker 2: Sixty-five [1965]. Yeah, '65 [1965], I was still working at Disney. And the reason we did this was because that riot was unique. It wasn't like the Rodney King riots some years later, where the media was all over the place. Keep in mind, in 1965, the media was afraid to go into Watts [Los Angeles, California], they were afraid. As a matter of fact, one news crew went into Watts and got pinned down. And I remember I heard the report that these guys were under their news van calling for help. (Laughter) You know, it was like being in a war zone. They were afraid. Well, we knew, Leo, Dick, and myself, that we could go into Watts. We could go into the streets of South Central, Los Angeles [California], because you know, we're African Americans, no one's going to hurt us.
Speaker 1: So, [HistoryMaker] Floyd Norman is in no ivory tower. He's at--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: He's out in the streets?
Speaker 2: Out in the streets, yeah. Here I am, a Disney employee working out there in fantasyland, but now here I am on the streets of Los Angeles, where L.A. is on fire.
Speaker 1: What was your mission for taking the cameras out? Did you want to maybe give this to someone so they could see from another perspective what's really going on?
Speaker 2: I think it was triggered by Leo, who said, "You know, we got these movie cameras. We got stuff going on in the streets. History is being made. Somebody ought to record it."
Speaker 1: Whatever happened to that footage?
Speaker 2: Believe it or not, we took that footage to NBC that same weekend. And if you saw footage of the Watts riot on NBC and the--what would you call them--the guy who handles the--the reporter on the spot. Tom Pettit was his name, who I believe may still be with NBC. Tom Pettit was the newscaster who handled that segment. If you saw footage of the Watts riot in 1965, it was probably our footage you saw.
Speaker 1: So, these Disney animators and these Disney people were actually--because now, these--
Speaker 2: Well, I was the only Disney employee.
Speaker 1: Right, you were the only Disney employee.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And they had other, there were other positions?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my associates, Leo Sullivan and Dick Allen were, were--
Speaker 1: At other companies?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at other companies, not employed by Disney.
Story_ID: 465780
Speaker 1: Are you starting to feel or see anything different at Disney [Walt Disney Studios, Burbank, California] when you're going there? Or are you seeing that they're out of touch? What are you seeing now? Because they're asking you what's going on (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, well--
Speaker 1: Are they starting to see things a little bit different now?
Speaker 2: Well, Disney, because they did exist in their own little world--and they were not all that different from the rest of the Hollywood studios. Keep in mind, this is Hollywood in the 1960s. The way things were at Disney was pretty much the way things were at Warner Brothers [Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc.], or 20th Century Fox [Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation], or at MGM [Metro Goldwyn Mayer Inc.; Metro Goldwyn Mayer Studios Inc.]. They were simply--you didn't have that diversity in the media. I mean, how many African Americans did you see on television in the 1960s? Or Latinos? Or Asians? You just didn't see them. For some reason, diversity was not a priority in America in the 1960s, until they were kind of like hit in the face with it when the cities began to catch fire. And people began to look up and say, "What's happening? And why is this happening?" They didn't have a clue; they didn't have a clue. And I said, "Well, there're certain people, certain segments of your society who feels like they're cut out. Feels like they're not getting their piece of the pie, and they're getting upset about it." They're getting so upset, I watched them light a Molotov cocktail and throw it through a shop window. Now that rage, you can't justify it, because I don't justify anybody burning down somebody's property, but that rage came from someplace. It came from a lot of angry people, a lot of people who felt they were shut out of the American dream. Now, I was lucky. I was kind of like living the American dream out there at the Walt Disney Studio. But a lot of people wasn't, you know, they weren't as fortunate as I was.
Speaker 1: Now, where were you living in Los Angeles [California] at that point?
Speaker 2: I was living in Los Angeles. I was living on 28th Street in the Adams district [West Adams] of Los Angeles. And we were largely untouched by the riots, although they were only blocks away, you know, they weren't that far away. I mean if you wanted to, you could probably walk down the street to Western Avenue a few blocks south and you might be in the thick of it. So, they weren't that far away. They were getting close, and the people in L.A. were getting nervous. They were getting nervous; they didn't know where this thing was going to end.
Story_ID: 465781
Speaker 1: So, now let's move back into the, to the story room--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in the story department [at Walt Disney Studios, Burbank, California].
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Now, you're working--because this is Walt Disney's pet, is the story department.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, now tell me about your interaction with him when he sees you there, the first time he saw you there.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: What did he say?
Speaker 2: To tell you the truth, I don't even think Walt noticed I was there, you know. I mean Walt was so focused on what he had to do, and that job that he-- because he had a big job. I mean he was the guy who ran this company, and I mean every aspect of it. Nothing got past Disney. He approved everything, and I do mean everything. So, yeah, I might have been in the room, but I seriously doubt if Walt noticed me. Now he may have, you know, and maybe he just didn't give it any attention. But no, I never got any special feeling that I was any different or any more unique than anybody else.
Speaker 1: Who was Walt Disney, the man, at this time, in the room? I mean he's talking and saying things to the department, and you're having these meetings.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What are you gleaning from him, personality-wise, dream-wise, or anything? What are you getting at this point?
Speaker 2: What I got from Walt Disney was a man who knew exactly what he wanted. He knew exactly what he wanted, and that's in everything he did, from his movies to his books and theme parks. And so, when you worked on a Disney film and you were showing the film to Walt Disney, you had to satisfy him. Because Walt knew that if the story satisfied him, chances are it's going to satisfy the rest of America and maybe even the rest of the world. He knew his product, and he knew it well. And one of the things that would serve you well if you were a Disney employee was to know what that Disney thing was--that Disney storytelling. And I do a lot of that even today when I teach the kids, the young kids coming up, what Disney storytelling is. Because it is unique, it is different.
Speaker 1: Do you see yourself as a--do you think that it was just bigger than a business for him, that he had some vision with these stories for America and the world?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Walt Disney was truly a visionary. I think that's why he was such an influential part of the 20th century. He really had something that he set out to do. I mean, even when he arrived in California with a cardboard suitcase and about eight bucks [dollars] in his pocket--or maybe it was forty dollars in his pocket--who knows, it wasn't much. But he came out to California to do his thing, and he was going to have an impact not only on entertainment, but on culture, on American culture as well.
Story_ID: 465782
Speaker 1: Now, had Disneyland [Anaheim, California] been built at this time yet?
Speaker 2: Disneyland had opened in 1955, I believe, yeah, a year before I started at Disney [Walt Disney Studios, Burbank, California]. The park opened in 1955, because I was there that first week.
Speaker 1: Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Oh, Disneyland, the first to trip to Disneyland. Well, I knew number one that the park was under construction. And of course most of America knew, because Walt Disney gave America the heads-up on his ABC television program. He told America, "I'm building this theme park, and boy, it's going to be like nothing you've ever seen before." So, he basically invited America to come to his theme park, and gave them the heads-up early on what it was going to be like. And Walt used the medium of television to essentially sell his park before it was ever constructed.
Speaker 1: Now, there had been parks before, like Coney Island [New York, New York] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --Coney Island and places.
Speaker 2: You bet, yeah.
Speaker 1: But now, Disneyland was going to have a different allure to it?
Speaker 2: It was going to be different. I mean when it's called Disneyland, it's called Disneyland for a reason. It's like no other theme park, like no other. And there had never been a theme park like this before. As a matter of fact, the name theme park I think comes from Disneyland. Because before, you had carnivals, you had parks, you had amusement parks, Coney Island, and that kind of thing, but never a theme park that was themed in the way Disney designed and put this park together.
Speaker 1: So, what was the buzz around the company at that time about this place?
Speaker 2: The buzz around the company was very positive. The buzz in the media in general was this was Walt Disney's folly. They thought this was just madness, nonsense, a waste of money. Who's going to come to an amusement park? Who's going to spend their money at a carnival, you know? Is the man, is he crazy? You know, but those of us who knew what Disney was, we knew that this was going to be a hit.
Speaker 1: So it opens up, and you're there on day one?
Speaker 2: Not on day one. Day one was the big media event where everything went wrong. (Laughter) Even though everything went wrong, it was still a successful opening, and it was televised across, you know, across the country.
Speaker 1: What were some of those faux pas that occurred?
Speaker 2: Oh, just a lot, a lot of the rides didn't work. The water fountains didn't work. Imagine a hot summer day in Southern California and the water fountains don't work. The asphalt was so fresh and new that the women in high heels would sink into the asphalt. Glitch after glitch, things going wrong.
Speaker 1: And what did he do? He just kept a straight face?
Speaker 2: Walt just kept a straight face, and just plowed through. He put a smile on his face and gave his introduction, and just welcomed America to Disneyland. And he was backed up by his co-hosts; Robert Cummings, Art Linkletter, and (laughter) Ronald Reagan [Ronald Wilson Reagan] were his co-hosts. And boy, that day was something special for those of us, you know, those who saw it on television.
Speaker 1: So, now when did you finally arrive to see it?
Speaker 2: A few days later, a few days later. And if you can imagine going to Disneyland when it's just days old. I mean the park, the paint is fresh, everything is new. The plants are new, all new construction. The cement, the concrete has just been poured. I mean this is a new park, and there was nothing like it in the world. And I'll tell you, it was just an experience. To be there that first week, you know, it would just blow your mind.
Speaker 1: Were employees encouraged to bring their families and come hang out? And were they given incentives, to go free? Could you go free in those days?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I'm trying to think back to that time. I'm sure employees got a special break on the price. But keep in mind, the price was like, it was under five dollars to get in. So, you know, even if you were kind of, you know, didn't have a whole lot of money, you could still take your family to the park. As a matter of fact, Walt Disney wanted the park to be priced in such a way that the average family would not have a hardship coming to the park.
Speaker 1: Do you recall many African Americans trying to get out to Disneyland?
Speaker 2: Oh, I recall everybody wanted to go to Disneyland, everybody wanted to go; it wasn't restricted. And nobody thought, gee, I can't go because I'm not part of this or that group. Everybody wanted to come to Disneyland, and everybody did go; everybody did go. I mean, that's what Walt Disney--he was able to capture the imagination of America, and that's what makes Disney so unique. Everybody resonates to what Disney puts out there. They get it, they feel it, you know. So yeah, the park was a huge hit, and it didn't surprise me.
Story_ID: 465783
Speaker 1: So, let's come back forward a little bit. Now, you've done 'Jungle Book' ['The Jungle Book'].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You worked on this scene called the waltz, the waltz scene, is that correct?
Speaker 2: Oh, I worked on the--one sequence I did was the song sequence where the snake, Kaa, hypnotizes Mowgli, the jungle boy.
Speaker 1: A very familiar scene (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And they do this little half-asleep--you know, Mowgli is sort of toyed with by Kaa, the snake, as he sings to him.
Speaker 1: So now, your music interests come back in. Because you're able to almost animate and do stories again with something else that you love, music.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah. And the way, the way that came about was we had storyboarded, Vance Gerry and myself, we had storyboarded this little sequence with Kaa and Mowgli up in the tree. And Walt [Walt Disney] saw it, and said, "You know what? We need a song here." So he had our in-house composers, the Sherman Brothers, Richard [Richard Sherman] and Robert Sherman, write a song for that particular sequence.
Speaker 1: An in-house composer must have been a really good gig?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: To be the in-house composer.
Speaker 2: You bet, yeah. And that's what made Disney [Walt Disney Studios, Burbank, California] unique, because it had in-house composers. It had guys who had been there for decades.
Speaker 1: So these guys would be in rooms on the piano, on the Disney thing, and writing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. And in those days, you were able to go to the recording sessions. I went, I went across the street to Stage A where Sterling Holloway who was the voice of Kaa, the snake, recorded the song. So I was able to watch Sterling record the song, and then get that song and take it back in to story, and then totally re-storyboard that song sequence to the music.
Story_ID: 465784
Speaker 1: Now before we move forward, we don't want to leave out the fact that there was a short [U.S.] military stint also.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What year would that have occurred?
Speaker 2: I got drafted in 1958.
Speaker 1: So, this is during the Korean--
Speaker 2: The Korean conflict [Korean War] had, the hot war had ended. And they had signed a truce--not a peace and not a hot war, but there was a truce in place in Korea. I got drafted as I was coming off of, I believe I was working on '101 Dalmatians' at Disney [Walt Disney Studios, Burbank, California]. Did my basic training at Fort Ord, California and then was shipped off to Korea.
Speaker 1: Now, what was that like? Now all of a sudden you're in the middle of this great job at Disney, and you get your papers.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, like most, you know, you do your part, you know. If you get the greetings from the government that you've got a new government job, you know, you have to do your thing. And so, I got drafted and I went into the military.
Speaker 1: Would your job in there have anything to do with your art whatsoever, art or journalism or anything? Were you given--because they knew your skill set, were you able--were things applied that way?
Speaker 2: One would have hoped so. And I hoped that would have happened, but no, not really. I mean I thought, well gosh, I've got these credentials as a Disney artist, so maybe I'm in line for some cushy job, you know. (Laughter) But--
Speaker 1: It didn't happen that way (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Boy, that didn't happen. I ended up on the frontlines up near Panmunjom in Korea, so close to the Chinese army I could see them (laughter).
Speaker 1: But fortunately--
Speaker 2: Too close for me (laughter).
Speaker 1: But fortunately there was no conflict, right?
Speaker 2: There was no conflict, but we didn't know that. Because there were always these skirmishes back and forth, where the North Koreans and the Red Chinese would every now and then, to let us know they were still there, you know, a wakeup call. They would lob shells at us on occasion. And more than one morning I would wake up to mortar fire when the North Koreans decided to shell us, in violation of the truce, by the way. They weren't supposed to do that, but they didn't play fair. So, there you go (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, now the quiet Santa Barbara [California] existence and the Walt Disney cushy job has changed.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, you're making sure that you don't get hit by mortar fire?
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly, yeah. Talk about a life-changing experience, here I am wearing the uniform of the U.S. military and carrying a rifle and finding myself trudging up and down the rice paddies of Korea.
Speaker 1: Now, were things different in the [U.S.] Army, as far as racial tension was concerned?
Speaker 2: Once again, maybe I was just blessed to not have any racial tension. Our unit was pretty much a mixture of everybody. It was kind of like one of those World War II [WWII] movies where everybody seems to be from all over America.
Speaker 1: From somewhere else?
Speaker 2: There's a guy from Brooklyn [New York], and a guy, a kid from Texas, and a guy from the Midwest, and a guy from the South. That was pretty much our unit. It sounded like the World War II movie where you had, you know, Private Gonzalez [ph.] and Private Lezinski [ph.], you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you were there from fifty--
Speaker 2: I was in Korea for fourteen months.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I got back to the states, I guess in 1959, I think.
Speaker 1: Close to '60 [1960]. And then you returned to Disney?
Speaker 2: Yeah. I had four more months to serve in the military. I was at Fort Jackson, South Carolina [Fort Jackson, Columbia, South Carolina] before being shipped back to my regular job at The Walt Disney Company [Walt Disney Productions; The Walt Disney Company, Burbank, California].
Speaker 1: Okay. And just to make sure we stay on track here, when did you get married?
Speaker 2: Didn't get married until 1967.
Story_ID: 465785
Speaker 1: We want to talk about before that, 1966.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now, you're, you've done this movie?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You're still working on 'Jungle Book' ['The Jungle Book']. Is it released yet in '66 [1966]?
Speaker 2: 'Jungle Book' had yet to be released. It wasn't released until 1967 I believe, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, but it was in production?
Speaker 2: It was in production, wrapping up, moving into post-production.
Speaker 1: And at that point you're about thirty years old, and something tragic at the company [Walt Disney Studios, Burbank, California] happens. Walt Disney passes away in '66 [1966].
Speaker 2: In '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: Had he been sick?
Speaker 2: Walt had been ill, and particularly the year 1966, his last year, working on 'The Jungle Book.' Now, keep in mind, we were all aware of Walt Disney's health problems. He was a heavy smoker, which didn't help any. And so, he had this smoker's cough. But that had gotten to be such a normal part of Walt Disney. I mean, anytime you would hear Walt coming down the hallway, you would always hear this cough. He almost announced himself by coughing, as he came down the hallway to a meeting. You would always hear this raspy cough. So, we were all kind of used to. And even though you think, well, the guy must be in poor health, no one ever gave it much thought. Because it was almost as though we were, you know, not connected with reality. It was almost as though we thought Walt Disney couldn't die. So when his death, when the news of his death came, even though we should have known better, it came as a total shock.
Speaker 1: Now the fantasy has become a reality.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: The immortality portrayed in many movies (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and many fantasy things--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --has hit home, as a finite person.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, exactly. And even though, logically, you know better, when the news of his death came it was almost like, "That can't be. Like Walt Disney can't die."
Speaker 1: And there was no way to write it out this time.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: No way to change the storybook.
Speaker 2: Yeah, no way to change the story, yeah. We got slapped in the face by reality.
Speaker 1: So, what happened at the company then? How was it after the funeral, and who stepped forward at that point?
Speaker 2: The company was somewhat in turmoil after Walt's death, because there was no real succession plan. In a sense, Walt's brother, his older brother, Roy Disney [Roy O. Disney], kind of like took up the reins and did his best to keep the studio going and keep it on an even footing, and finished Walt's project down in Orlando [Florida], Walt Disney World [Walt Disney World Resort]. As a matter of fact, Roy Disney promised his younger brother that he would complete the Orlando project.
Speaker 1: So this was ten years after Walt Disney--that Disneyland [Anaheim, California] opened up (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: And then they started the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the bigger project in Orlando.
Speaker 1: In Florida.
Speaker 2: In Florida. Right.
Story_ID: 465786
Speaker 1: So now at this point in history you, you're there at the company [Walt Disney Studios, Burbank, California] and you're seeing this turmoil. What does [HistoryMaker] Floyd Norman decide to do at this point?
Speaker 2: Floyd Norman decides to make a major change in his life. And along with my partner, Leo Sullivan--
Speaker 1: The one that you hit the Watts [Los Angeles, California] streets with?
Speaker 2: The one that we did the Watts streets--the riot, you know, filming. Leo Sullivan, a talented artist himself, and filmmaker; Dick Allen who was the police officer who went to the USC film school [University of Southern California School of Cinema-Television; University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts, Los Angeles, California]; and Norman Edelen, another ex-police officer, who wanted to be a screenwriter, we decided to form a company.
Speaker 1: You all started an African American film company.
Speaker 2: We started an African American film Company. Even though we didn't want to be called that, we kind of hated that tag of being an African American film company, because we always thought that, gee, our guys out at Filmation [Filmation Associates] are not known as the Jewish, you know cartoon company. And Bill Melendez [Bill Melendez Productions] is not the Latino animation company. So, therefore, why should we be the African American animation company? We just wanted to be an animation company.
Speaker 1: And a good one.
Speaker 2: And a good one, exactly.
Speaker 1: So, this is 1966?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, let's put it in context. It was an African American film company at that point (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, it was, yeah, no doubt about that.
Speaker 1: Which was--was that a bit unheard of at that point? Or was it starting to open up in that direction?
Speaker 2: It was unheard of for its time. Now, we certainly weren't the first, because anybody who knows their African American history would know that there were African American filmmakers as far back as the 1930s.
Speaker 1: Give us some names, for those who--
Speaker 2: Oscar Micheaux was an entrepreneur who was actually making and marketing African American films in the 1930s. He had his own production company [Micheaux Book and Film Company], and probably handled his own distribution throughout the country, because his films were only shown at African American theaters in certain cities across the country. So, we were by no means the first to embark, you know, on an African American enterprise like this.
Speaker 1: What was the mission, or the direction of your company? What was the company called?
Speaker 2: The company's name was Vignette Films, Vignette Films, Inc. And--
Speaker 1: What was your mission, your purpose? What kind of films did you all plan on making?
Speaker 2: Our mission was, believe it or not, just to be a film company. We didn't start out with some lofty ambition to change the world. We just wanted to do what we did, you know, and that was to make films, to write and direct and produce our own films. We weren't trying to be, you know, messengers of (laughter)--you know, to carry any certain kind of message. We just wanted to do our thing, much in the way we saw our white colleagues start their companies and do their thing. They weren't known as white companies; they were just film companies. We wanted to be a film company, just like them.
Speaker 1: And in doing that, though, however, didn't you do a few short films on black history?
Speaker 2: Yes, we did. And that, out of necessity, because when you're trying to get in the door, you've got to have something that nobody else has, something that makes you unique. And because we knew there was a need for films on African American history that became our way in.
Speaker 1: So this is '66 [1966]?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-six [1966], right.
Speaker 1: And because you have been working--I guess there was a little budget that you had to kind of work with?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Your own budget, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah, our own budget. Well, we actually had an investor who was able to fund us.
Speaker 1: Are you able to say his name or?
Speaker 2: Oh, I sure can, because we owe this man a great deal. His name was Douglas Russell [ph.].
Speaker 1: And was he a--
Speaker 2: Doug Russell. I believe his line of work was, he was in investment banking. Now, keep in mind how Doug came to our rescue. We had a proposal to start this company, Vignette Films, a company that was run mainly by African Americans. We took our business proposals to banks throughout Los Angeles [California]. And no joke, we were pretty much laughed out of every bank in L.A., because the idea of African Americans starting a movie company at that time was ludicrous.
Speaker 1: So now, Floyd Norman now starting to sense something, a big difference than he's experienced in all these years.
Speaker 2: Well, we always knew it was there. I mean, we were not naive.
Speaker 1: But you're personally getting it now.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Just because we worked in fantasyland--just because Leo and I had worked for the cartoon studios--we were still very much aware of what the real world was like. And we knew it would be no easy go for African Americans to try to make it in the business world, especially in a world that Hollywood had so locked down.
Speaker 1: So, basically you were told--you were denied at all the banks, the major banks?
Speaker 2: Pretty much, pretty much.
Speaker 1: So Mr. Russell comes into play.
Speaker 2: Mr. Russell who had, a man who had been quite successful in life, who had some money in the bank, a guy who could easily sit down and pull out a check and write a check for several thousand dollars.
Speaker 1: Now, what nationality was this person?
Speaker 2: Mr. Russell was, he was a white man.
Speaker 1: And how did he hear about Vignette?
Speaker 2: You know, I really don't know. All I know is my partners, who kind of like ran the business side of things, they were the ones who were hitting the streets going from bank to bank. Somewhere along the way they must have made contact with Mr. Russell, or he heard our name, or he heard of our plight. And so he came to our rescue as our primary investor.
Speaker 1: As an investor?
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure did. And believe it or not, he got his money back. We paid him back. We paid back the loan in full, with interest (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, how long did the film company last?
Speaker 2: I would say about seven years or so, about seven years.
Story_ID: 465787
Speaker 1: And in the midst of this time in '66 [1966], you, this film company [Vignette Films, Inc.], [HistoryMaker] Floyd Norman's life is changing. You have a film company now. You're an entrepreneur, you're your own boss now--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) with about a good, we'll say, ten, fifteen years' experience of working under Disney [Walt Disney], or somewhere thereabouts, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you've been to the [U.S.] Army?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, '67 [1967] comes up and you decide that you will add to your personal life?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, how did that occur?
Speaker 2: Well, I met a young woman from, she was out here visiting from, oddly enough from down south, you know. And once again, that connection to the South again--my parents [Evelyn Davis Norman and James Norman, Sr.] and grandparents are all from the South. I meet this young woman, and we kind of hit it off.
Speaker 1: Her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Bell, Bell Mann [ph.]. And we seemed to get along together, and actually things moved rather fast. (Laughter) Because when I look back on it now, it was. Because I met her I think in the spring. And wow, that was fast, yeah. And by the fall, by November, we were married.
Speaker 1: So, what was Bell Mann's profession or?
Speaker 2: She had no profession at the time. I mean, she was just out of high school and was working on a clerical job at a local college. I'm not sure what she was doing there, but it had to do with computers at that time, which was kind of like a punch-card kind of thing, you know.
Speaker 1: And what did she think about your profession as this--basically you're a filmmaker, and--
Speaker 2: A filmmaker.
Speaker 1: And you drew pictures.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah. I think she probably thought I was kind of odd, you know. It was probably not something she was used to, but I think she took it in stride. I took her to a few Hollywood events to try to, you know, try to impress her, you know, to try to, you know, show her the Hollywood night life and meet some big shots. But--
Speaker 1: So she was visiting, and she decided that she'd stay, huh?
Speaker 2: She hadn't planned to stay. But once she, once we decided to get married, she decided to stay.
Speaker 1: Well, you had a knack of telling stories now, though (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yeah. (Laughter) Yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 465788
Speaker 1: So, the company goes on for about seven years, you say (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Seven more years.
Speaker 1: So, we've moved into the '70s [1970s] now.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And what happens to cause the company to disband?
Speaker 2: Well, a good portion of our income for Vignette Films [Vignette Films, Inc.] was the educational market. We could not break into mainstream media to save our lives. And we were aware that that was not going to be easy. Trying to break into television, motion pictures, and the mainstream was not easy, not easy for anybody. But we were still trying. But our bread and butter was the educational film market. But by the 1970s, the educational market began to dry up, so that was going to just leave Vignette Films out to dry.
Speaker 1: So from you all's experience of many years, you knew that now might be the time to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: "It's time to do something else, guys."
Speaker 2: Yeah. And the one advantage we had, because of our years of experience in the media, we knew that we could always go back--
Speaker 1: Individually and find jobs (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and to, and find jobs in the studios, in the Hollywood studios.
Story_ID: 465789
Speaker 1: So after the company [Vignette Films, Inc.] disbanded, or you know dissolved, what did you do?
Speaker 2: I, let me think now, if I went to--I think I went to Hanna-Barbera [Hanna-Barbera Productions, Inc.] for a while. I worked at Hanna-Barbera, and we were doing Saturday morning television and, you know, all of that. So many shows, 'The Flintstones,' you know, 'Jonny Quest,' 'The Smurfs,' 'Scooby-Doo' (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, you say you worked on all of those?
Speaker 2: I worked on all of those, yeah.
Speaker 1: And now you're (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I worked on so many shows that I can't even remember; there were so many of them. 'Richie Rich' was another one.
Speaker 1: There was a thing that occurred, and now that you're a part of it--every fall there would be a new crop of cartoons.
Speaker 2: Right, right, the new season of cartoons.
Speaker 1: And there was a Friday night before--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --on television where they would show clips.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember that now.
Speaker 1: And I can remember as a kid that if you missed--you had to see the preview of what was coming on Saturday morning--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: --for the new series. And you'd sit there and you'd lay on the floor and you'd watch on Friday night. And you'd get up early as I don't know what on Saturday morning--
Speaker 2: Yeah, early Saturday morning.
Speaker 1: --to see the new cartoons.
Speaker 2: You bet.
Speaker 1: And you were responsible for the--did you supervise for 'Scooby' and all those things? 'Scooby-Doo,' 'Jonny Quest'?
Speaker 2: I worked on them. I didn't become a supervisor until sometime later.
Speaker 1: 'The Smurfs,' all of that?
Speaker 2: But I worked on those shows in several categories. I started out as an animator. I animated on some of the shows, and then I moved into the layout department and I was a layout artist for a time. I kept moving, it seems. And then I worked as a storyboard artist on Saturday morning television, and then eventually as a writer.
Speaker 1: So, now--
Speaker 2: So, I did every job almost.
Speaker 1: That was a very, a very interesting period for cartoons, and I think just people. Because if I recall, Saturday morning cartoons started to change in the next ten years or so.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But that was a very, there was a lot of great cartoon television.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: I believe that was also during the time when you had your 'Schoolhouse Rock!'.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: They were doing different things.
Speaker 2: Right, right. And don't forget 'Sesame Street,' I worked on that as well. That was a breakthrough show in the 1960s.
Speaker 1: You also worked on that?
Speaker 2: Worked on 'Sesame Street,' yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was, at the time I was on the show, I didn't even know exactly what it was going to be. All I knew was I was working for an organization known as the Children's Television Workshop [Sesame Workshop]. And I was given this job to do these little animated segments, and I did a bunch of these things. And then later I finally heard what the name of the show was going to be, and it was called 'Sesame Street.' And I thought, oh, that's a great name. It's kind of like the old, you know, "Open sesame," you know. And it was in that way opening up education to children, you know. And it was a breakthrough show. I mean, it changed the way kids were educated on television. So, I was very proud to be a part of 'Sesame Street.' And then a few years later, I was part of a bilingual show called 'Villa Alegre' which we did in English and Spanish. So I would animate my animated segments in two languages, English and Spanish.
Story_ID: 465790
Speaker 1: In your opinion, did you notice that there was an attentiveness--or the attention spans--or what had to happen was quite different than it is today for children? Because I can recall watching those shows--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and we won't say the animation was basic, because of course, you all were very well ahead of your time on a lot of things. But when you look at television nowadays and things, the attention span--and what has to occur is different (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: I can recall watching 'The Flintstones'--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --and seeing the same people in a line going back and forth, but I didn't care, because the story was so good.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: You see the same little--the head, you know, going back and forth in a line.
Speaker 2: That was for economic reasons, of course.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah. Or I can also recall watching shows like 'Charlie Brown,' that had very little of what we would call animation. There was a lot going on, but the story had you compelled to where you were absolutely silent. Kids would just lay on the floor, you wouldn't say a word.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, do you think it's different nowadays? And what has precipitated--what has facilitated this big difference? Do you think our technology has made us less attentive?
Speaker 2: Well, media is always changing. And people often say we're part, the kids are part of the MTV [Music Television; MTV] generation where everything just moves faster, you know. And films are cut faster today. If you go to watch a film from the 1940s, and you watch a current day film, you'll find that the films are edited faster, the cutting is just more rapid. And I think it's because people are just, either they're more media savvy and they just absorb stuff; you know, they absorb information faster. And also, because we're just used to this, you know, just this media explosion. If you look at some of the TV screens, some of the screens are just filled with all kinds of stuff. At the bottom, you've got a crawler going along at the bottom of the screen. You've got stuff on the side. I think we've just become so used to computers and information being thrown at us so rapidly. That affects everything. It certainly affects the way films are made today, that's for sure.
Speaker 1: So you think when things are slowed down, that people have a tendency to not be able to process the slower stuff as well as they can the faster--?
Speaker 2: I think people are just used to processing information faster. It's because kids today have just grown up with media, and they're just more media savvy. I know that my grandchildren can absorb information, you know, very fast. And so that's just, that's kind of to be expected I guess.
Story_ID: 465791
Speaker 1: So you come through the '70s [1970s], and you're back in, back working on animation again?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: In '79 [1979], you and Leo [Leo Sullivan] were honored in the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame [Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame, Inc.] up in Oakland [California], correct (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: And that was for your work that you had done previously?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was a real nice gesture by the Black Filmmakers to honor us for what we considered--we were just doing our job (laughter).
Speaker 1: You've been honored twice, actually, by them?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes. They gave us another award, you know, because of the films we had produced on African American history, and I guess because--for our time, I guess what we had done was considered somewhat extraordinary, you know.
Speaker 1: Are those films still available for viewing?
Speaker 2: Yes, they are. They are, I've been told that they're still in the school system.
Speaker 1: Okay. So, we'll probably have to just look up--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and do some searching on the net--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to find out what--?
Speaker 2: The media has changed. It's kind of funny how we watch the way media is distributed. Initially, back when we were doing the films it was on 16mm film, then it went to videotape. I'm sure now it's on DVD, you know. But the content is still there. The medium changes, but the content's there.
Story_ID: 465792
Speaker 1: So in the mid-'80s [1980s], after doing, after working for Hanna-Barbera [Hanna-Barbera Productions, Inc.] and places like that and doing all the cartoons, you return to Disney [Walt Disney Studios, Burbank, California]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Tell me about that.
Speaker 2: I returned to Disney because I recognized that Disney was still the A-list studio, you know. I mean if you wanted to do top-flight work, top-quality work, Disney was the place to be. And even though I had received job offers for more money at other studios, I told my wife [Norman's second wife, Adrienne Brown-Norman], I said, "I'm going back to Disney, because I think there's going to be more opportunity to do something good there."
Speaker 1: Now in the course of--of course you have children by now?
Speaker 2: Right, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How many children do you have at this point?
Speaker 2: I have five children.
Speaker 1: What do they think about their dad? Their dad, once they realized and got old enough to know that their dad was the person behind a lot of these things, how did the children respond? What did they think? How did they feel about this?
Speaker 2: Oh, they might feel--
Speaker 1: Did they tell kids, "My daddy is Mickey Mouse?"
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What did they tell the kids?
Speaker 2: They might feel different now. But I'll tell you, and I've heard this from other friends and colleagues who are in the business. The children are not all that impressed by what their parents do for a living, you know. I know this one producer and director that I consider quite successful. His teenage son is not all that impressed with his dad, you know. (Laughter) For him, "This is what my dad does for a living, it's no big deal." Now maybe when he grows older he'll look back and say, "Wow, my father really accomplished a great deal."
Speaker 1: He'll say it then.
Speaker 2: But, but, for now he said his teenage son just couldn't care less.
Speaker 1: So, you went back into the development publishing division, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Creative development and publishing?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now what was that actually? What division--what did they do?
Speaker 2: Well, I had wanted, I had been working in film most of my career. And there's still this thing in the back of my mind from my high school newspaper [The Forge] where I was still intrigued by print media. There's still something special about picking up a book and holding it. Yeah, it's cool to go to a movie theater and you'll see a movie you worked on, and you say, "That's a really creative, you know, movie." If you watch a movie, in a couple of hours it's over, it's gone, forgotten. When people walk out of a movie theater, we usually say, "What's the first thing they say?" They say, "What do you want to have for dinner?" (Laughter) They've totally forgot the movie that they just, that they've just seen. But a book--I remember when I wrote I think one of my first books for Disney. I'd written this book and kind of forgot about it. And I was in a bookstore, and I looked on the shelf and I see a book that I had written. And I picked it up and I opened it, and saw my name inside. And I said, "Wow, I've got a book in a bookstore. That's really cool, you know." (Laughter) There's something special about a book. And so, yeah, I've not lost that love for publishing and for that part of the media that's print, you know, and that thing that's tangible that you can hold in your hand.
Speaker 1: So you're in your forties at this point?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. Well maybe, I think in my fifties I think.
Speaker 1: So you go back to--how long do you work in that department?
Speaker 2: I wanted to try this publishing thing for a couple of years. I had turned my boss down. He had offered me a job at Disney Publishing [The Disney Publishing Group; Disney Publishing Worldwide]. He offered me the job three times, and I turned him down twice. The third time I finally said, "Okay, I'll try this for a couple of years." I thought it would be cool to learn about how books are made. I ended up staying ten years.
Speaker 1: You stayed ten years there?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And quite a few titles I'm sure came under your direction?
Speaker 2: I had a chance to write a lot of stuff, everything from children's books, comic books, and even the Mickey Mouse comic strip, which was another job I didn't want, (laughter) but got handed to me because the writer of the Mickey Mouse comic strip had retired. And so, I had been filling in on occasion for various strips, you know, Donald Duck and Scamp and Mickey Mouse.
Speaker 1: So, where were these? These were still in, like, papers across the country (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They were in newspapers, yeah.
Speaker 1: Syndicated across the country?
Speaker 2: Yeah. We were syndicated by King Features Syndicate [King Features Syndicate, Inc.], and they were in newspapers across the, across the country.
Speaker 1: Who do you think the viewing audience was for Mickey Mouse at that point? Do you think kids were--?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Much smaller.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Much smaller, yeah, very small. You see, because once again, media had changed, and kids were no longer reading comics in the newspapers. Adults were hardly reading comics in the newspapers at that time.
Speaker 1: But do you think there were a few die-hard Mickey Mouse strip fans?
Speaker 2: Well, probably a few fans.
Speaker 1: My dad being one.
Speaker 2: Yeah, probably a few fans, not that many unfortunately. Because eventually, in the early '90s [1990s], the strip was finally cancelled by King Features because the readership was so low.
Story_ID: 465793
Speaker 1: So, as we were saying, you stayed in the division of creative development and publishing for about ten years.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And in 1990 or so, you get back into the actual movie-making business with Disney [Walt Disney Studios, Burbank, California] again. Tell us about that please?
Speaker 2: Right. I had been away from animation for, wow, ten years. And all of a sudden, animation began to just develop in a whole new way. The studio had new management that came in in 1984, Michael Eisner and Frank Wells now ran The Walt Disney Company [Walt Disney Productions; The Walt Disney Company, Burbank, California]. Jeffrey Katzenberg came in as the chairman of the film division, and I thought that Jeffrey was going to be a disaster for animation. It turns out that animation began to thrive under Jeffrey.
Speaker 1: Why? Did you think he was unskilled in the area? What did you think? He was more business (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not because Katzenberg was a bad guy, but because Jeffrey was from Paramount [Paramount Pictures Corporation], as was Michael Eisner. And I thought, well, these are live action movie guys, you know, they're big Hollywood guys, and they don't get what we do. They don't know the Disney thing. They don't know how cartoons are made. They have no idea how this business works. So, they're just going to come in and just bring all of their hot-shot Hollywood ideas and just mess things up. And I thought animation was just going to be the first casualty, I thought it would be a disaster. And it turns out that as the films began to roll out of Disney Feature Animation [Walt Disney Animation Studios], as it was called back then, I remember the first film that really took me by surprise was 'Beauty and the Beast.' No, no, no, it was--
Speaker 1: 'The Hunchback'?
Speaker 2: Let's jump back, jump back. It was 'The Little Mermaid.' 'The Little Mermaid,' a big hit, a big hit, under Jeffrey Katzenberg's leadership. Then 'Beauty and the Beast,' 'Aladdin,' 'The Lion King.' We were making hit after hit at Disney.
Speaker 1: 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame'?
Speaker 2: 'Hunchback,' that was the film that brought me back to Feature Animation.
Speaker 1: 'Mulan'? 'Mulan.'
Speaker 2: 'Mulan,' yes.
Speaker 1: 'The Tigger Movie'?
Speaker 2: 'The Tigger Movie.'
Speaker 1: And so you were there in the midst of all of those?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what was your role there, exactly?
Speaker 2: I was a story artist, back to my old role as a storyteller. And I had come back to animation as a story artist.
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk about that. Because now, years later, we'll say almost forty years later or more (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now you're one of the guys, the big guys, and everybody else is realizing who you are now. You're now in the role of the guys walking down the hall.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, I never, I never considered myself one of the big guys.
Speaker 1: I'm sure that most of the story room--
Speaker 2: One of the old guys, maybe. But--
Speaker 1: There were a lot of younger guys there too now, right?
Speaker 2: A lot younger, yeah. The crews, the crews were a lot younger. And a lot of us old Disney guys had either retired or moved on. And as a matter of fact, I don't think that--it wasn't exactly the way you might picture it. Because things had changed in the years I'd been away from animation. There was a whole new way of telling stories for the screen. People had really bought into the screenwriting ideas that were being taught by guys like Bob McKee [Robert McKee] and Truby [John Truby], and the storytelling had evolved into this new way of putting movies on the screen. Now it wasn't particularly my way of telling stories, and it wasn't the way I learned under Walt Disney. So, in a sense, even though I went back to Disney as an old-timer, as a veteran, I found myself almost like a fish out of water. Because I felt like, gee, maybe I don't fit with these new ideas, you know. Because the way the kids were working wasn't necessarily the way I saw story, because I had learned storytelling under Walt Disney. And it wasn't the fault of the kids, because they simply hadn't, you know, they hadn't learned this stuff; they hadn't been there in the 1960s or the 1950s. So, in a way I felt that maybe I had come back to the wrong job; maybe I was not in the right place. And what changed my mind on that was after working on a few Disney films, I suddenly got the opportunity to go up to Pixar Animation Studios [Emeryville, California].
Story_ID: 465794
Speaker 1: Now you're in this environment, are those--we'll call them kids, for lack of a better term (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, kids.
Speaker 1: Just to show the example.
Speaker 2: Talented kids.
Speaker 1: They were kids, talented kids.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did, were they enamored by you having been there and actually being in the midst of Walt Disney, and being there in the early days? What was, what was your role? Were you more of a mentor to them? And even though you were a mentor, you already explained quite well that you were a student at the same time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: You were learning these new ways.
Speaker 2: I think I was respected. I don't think they were particularly enamored of me. I think I was respected because I'd been around a while. And some of the kids, you know, were great to work with, and work for. So, I had no problem there.
Speaker 1: Now at this point, were there more African Americans in the company [Walt Disney Studios, Burbank, California], in that department, in storytelling at that point?
Speaker 2: A few, still not that many. A handful.
Speaker 1: And do you think that might have been just because of the interest of certain things? Do you think sometimes that we construe- misconstrue the lack of--with the discrimination thing versus maybe the interest and the development?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's the interest. Keep in mind that animation, it's such an odd, unique little business. It doesn't attract, you know, everybody. And the people who go into it tend to be rather different, you know, rather--might have rather quirky sensibilities. This is mainstream. Now, think of that in terms of a minority group. Well, there're going to be fewer and fewer people who are going to be drawn to this odd little business. So I think that's why there were so few, you know, African Americans, Latinos, and others who maybe just didn't see this business as the business for them, not because minorities were kept out of the business. It's just that, it just didn't appeal, it had no appeal for them.
Story_ID: 465795
Speaker 1: So you, you're there now, you're working, you're learning new things?
Speaker 2: Um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And then around '97 [1997], we'll say you're probably in your fifties good then?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Or maybe older, I don't know.
Speaker 1: So 'Toy Story,' and Pixar [Pixar Animation Studios, Emeryville, California] comes into your life.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: How did this occur? And Pixar, as we all know, is a major player now in the animated movies.
Speaker 2: A young kid, a young talented kid named Joe Ranft stopped me on the street of Pasadena [California] one evening. I just happened to run into him on Green Street. And he said, "Floyd [HistoryMaker Floyd Norman], you've got to come up north. We got a new studio going, we're doing great things. It's going to be fantastic." And I said, "Joe, gosh, I just bought a house here in Pasadena. I can't--and I'm working at Disney [Walt Disney Studios, Burbank, California]. I can't pull up stakes and move up north, move up to the Bay Area [San Francisco Bay Area, California]. I got too much going on down here, you know." And later, I regretted that decision. Because that film that Joe was working on was called 'Toy Story,' which turned out to be a darn good little film, you know, directed by John Lasseter. Some years later when Disney and Pixar decided to do a sequel to 'Toy Story,' once again I was asked, "Do you want to work on this?" This time I said, "Yeah," I said, "yes." And I'm glad I did, because it was a darn good film, you know.
Speaker 1: So you worked on 'Toy Story 2'?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I didn't work on the first one. I kind of like passed on that one when Joe told me about it. But certainly worked on the second one.
Speaker 1: So this time, you're still working with Disney also?
Speaker 2: I was still employed by Disney, but Disney loaned me to Pixar. Disney and Pixar were partners. Disney hadn't yet, you know, purchased the company, but they had this partnership agreement to co-produce and market and distribute Pixar's films.
Speaker 1: So, were you able to work--kind of telework, or did you actually go up north?
Speaker 2: I did that for a while. I worked at the Disney Studio for the first few months on 'Toy Story 2,' but then it became necessary to move up north to Pixar. At that time they were located in Point Richmond [Richmond, California], just above Berkeley [California] up in the Bay Area. So, I had to move up there. If you're working on a film, you need to be there with the other artists, you know. It's kind of hard to work from any distance and work effectively. And so I knew that I needed to move north, and I did. I moved up to San Rafael [California].
Speaker 1: So you told your wife [Adrienne Brown-Norman], "I'll be gone for a little while."
Speaker 2: Yeah, "I'll be gone," exactly, "I'll be gone for a little while," so she had to deal with that. Pixar was very generous, they allowed me to fly home on weekends. So I call what I was doing, I was doing the Pixar shuttle. I would fly back to Burbank [California] on Friday evenings and fly back up on Monday mornings.
Speaker 1: So you had 'Toy Story'--and when you were there, you did 'Toy Story 2' and also 'Monsters, Inc.' (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Monsters, Inc.,' yeah.
Speaker 1: Another huge hit.
Speaker 2: Yeah, another huge hit, yeah.
Speaker 1: And then I guess after a while, after working at Pixar you decided that it was time to take a break from all of it?
Speaker 2: Well, it was time to come home. It was time--I came back to Disney in the year 2000. January of 2000 when I went back to Disney to work on a project, at the end of development. And I stayed on that for almost a year before I actually retired from the company around the fall of 2000.
Story_ID: 465796
Speaker 1: Now, what is Afrokids?
Speaker 2: Afrokids is a website, once again, the brainchild of my partner and colleague, Leo Sullivan. Leo Sullivan saw the potential of the Internet and said, "You know, we should be part of that." And--
Speaker 1: So, you're kind of in semi-retirement now (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: You're winding down now?
Speaker 2: I'm winding down.
Speaker 1: And here comes Leo with another project.
Speaker 2: With another project, yeah, yeah, with another project. And Leo said, "I see the Internet as an opportunity to do more stuff. It's just a whole new venue for us to jump into. I mean we've done television, we've done feature films, you know, books. Now, here's the Internet, here's a new opportunity to do what maybe hasn't been done before." So--
Speaker 1: And what does Afrokids really do? What is it about?
Speaker 2: Well, basically it's, it's a site for kids. But it's a site for the whole family, and we'd like to make it as interactive as possible, a place where--a safe place, where children [sic.] can have their kids log on the Internet, read stories, participate in games. Who knows where we might take this thing? I mean, right now--
Speaker 1: Is there history there, all kinds of--
Speaker 2: There's African American history as well, because that was also part of what we did back in the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s]; we did African American history. So we can bring all these things to this new media, this new thing called the Internet. All of those things we've learned and worked with in the past, we can now bring to Afrokids. And so, that's what, that's what Afrokids does for us. And I'm working on scripts for it now.
Story_ID: 465797
Speaker 1: So now you worked on an unnamed film that turned out to be 'Wild Life.'
Speaker 2: 'Wild Life,' yes, the unnamed project (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right. And was it unnamed because there just was no name for it?
Speaker 2: No, no, that's not--no, it had a name, it very definitely had a name. It's just that the film was never made.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was one of those projects that just did not fit Disney's [Walt Disney Studios, Burbank, California] family entertainment. And the film was shown to Roy Disney [Roy E. Disney], Walt Disney's nephew, and he felt the film was inappropriate for the Disney market and shut the film down.
Speaker 1: So, that was about 2000?
Speaker 2: That was 2000, yeah.
Speaker 1: You also at some point, I don't know if it was before or after, you worked on 'Curious George'?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--
Speaker 1: That was after because that movie was much--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was sometime later. I spent a few months on the feature film, 'Curious George,' because I'd worked with the film's director [Matthew O'Callaghan] a couple of years before on 'The Tigger Movie,' which was a very, you know, cute little film. And I'm very good at doing cute by the way (laughter). So, I tell people that. So 'Curious George' was, once again, a very young project. It's meant for younger children, very innocent, very cute, which kind of fits my sensibility. So I worked on 'Curious George' for a bit.
Story_ID: 465798
Speaker 1: And in 2003 you received an award, the, the, I think it's the Winsor McCay lifetime achievement award [Winsor McCay Award].
Speaker 2: Oh, that's right. Yeah the--an animation organization called ASIFA [ASIFA-Hollywood]--and don't ask me what that means, (laughter) because I don't remember what ASIFA means. But they have this event every year called the Annie Awards, and they honor people in this industry who they feel have contributed or achieved, you know, a certain level of excellence. And they hand out awards, much like, you know an Oscars [Academy Awards], for the animation industry. And so they were nice enough to give me this award for my contributions over the years.
Speaker 1: And also, we see that you've also received an award from Disney [The Walt Disney Company, Burbank, California] itself. Tell us about that award.
Speaker 2: The Walt Disney Legends award was established about ten years ago, to honor the people who have--the artists, writers, directors, actors, who have contributed to, you know, the world of Walt Disney, you know, that world of media, that world of movies, television, theme parks. And it includes everybody from, you know, all the crafts, all the creative aspects of the company. And we've got some great names. I mean, the people whose work I've admired since I was a kid have been made Disney Legends. Honestly, I never saw myself in that illustrious group. But for some reason (laughter) they decided to give me the Disney Legends award, which I am extremely grateful and honored, but still somewhat overwhelmed by.
Speaker 1: Was this done at a ceremony?
Speaker 2: Yes. The Disney Legends award are always, it's a rather private ceremony. There're only about a hundred people who attend. It's held on the Disney lot [Walt Disney Studios, Burbank, California], just the members, just the people who are being inducted into the Disney Legends and their families. Maybe some media is there, but it's a very low-key event. It's not a big, lavish--it's not like an Oscar or Golden Globes [Golden Globe Awards] ceremony. It's pretty much low-key.
Story_ID: 465799
Speaker 1: So what are you doing today? What is, what are--it's hard to believe that you're retired from anything. So what's going on today for you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I retired, but it seems I can't stay retired. And besides, I find retirement boring anyway.
Speaker 1: So are you still writing for anything? Are you still animating anything? Are you still drawing?
Speaker 2: I stay busy. And I take this lesson from one of my mentors, an old guy who worked at Disney [Walt Disney Studios, Burbank, California] for many years, who was a legend himself. And that's the great artist and animator, Ward Kimball. When I saw Ward Kimball on the Disney lot [Walt Disney Studios, Burbank, California] some years ago, and Ward had been retired for some years, I asked him what he was doing. And he told me, "Well, you know, I'm retired, but every now and then I'll work. But I only take the jobs that are fun." So I thought, "Well, that's a great way to look at life." So--
Speaker 1: Now, the term that we use very cavalierly now is the consultant.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, you can be a consultant now.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, exactly, I can be a consultant. And again, like Ward, I can take the jobs that are fun.
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this. Do you think that having the mi- that having your experience and tenure--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --mixed with the technology and youthfulness of those who are thirty years or forty years your junior--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Do you think that's a recipe for success that many companies might want to look at to have the success that Disney has had over the years, to not just kick out the tenured, and not just accept everything also that's youthful as being the hippest and correct thing?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Do you think that mixture, that blend, is a successful recipe?
Speaker 2: I would agree with that very much. I bring back the man I was just talking about, Ward Kimball. When I used to visit Ward Kimball's unit at Disney in the 1950s when he was doing those amazing space films--they were breakthrough films, they were quite something. But the one thing I noticed about Kimball's crew that I think is a very important lesson to remember, his crew consisted of old-timers, veterans, who had been through the wars, who knew their stuff, and talented young people just getting started in the business. That combination of, of the wisdom and the experience of the veterans along with the vitality and the freshness of the young kids, that's a winning combination.
Speaker 1: It's been seen in all kinds of areas (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in your particular case.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: Also, if you look at people like Art Blakey and The Jazz Messengers--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --where he kept new groups.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: And even Miles Davis' bands--
Speaker 2: You bet.
Speaker 1: --he would always keep some young people behind him, and he would be the leader--
Speaker 2: Very true.
Speaker 1: --and he would lead.
Speaker 2: True, very true.
Speaker 1: And Art Blakey would change those bands. So, I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And Wynton [Wynton Marsalis] was one of the people that came out of his group.
Speaker 2: That's right. And as a fan of the big bands, I used to go out and see the big bands play. And I would always be kind of--you know, it was fun to see the old-timers sitting there on the bandstand.
Speaker 1: Johnny Hodges, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the veterans along with the kids who were new, who had just joined the band. So, there was this mixture of the old-timers and the kids all playing together, all making music, you know.
Speaker 1: There's something to that, huh.
Speaker 2: There's something to it, that's a winning combination. And I worked on many, many projects where I've had what I call the kids and codgers--kids and codgers--old-timers and young kids--each bringing what they had to bring to the table. And you can't do any better than that.
Story_ID: 465800
Speaker 1: How do you feel about the way that you've lived your life? And what's really important to you now?
Speaker 2: People often think I'm going to say what's the most important thing in my life would be my career. And my answer for that would be no. My most important thing would be family. I think the most important job I've done is to be a good father, a good husband, and to guide my family. Second, I would put my career. And I've had a great career, I've enjoyed it. It's been, it's been a real privilege to work in this business and to work with so many good people. I mean, I think that's what I can take with me, is that I've had a chance to share my life and to work with some incredibly talented and wonderful people. And that's enriched my life. These old guys, guys and gals, have enriched my life so much. And that's why I try to give back to the kids who come to me and ask me questions or want me to look at their work or review their films. Because the old guys gave me their time and the benefit of their knowledge and experience, I want to do the same.
Story_ID: 465801
Speaker 1: For those that are going into the film or the animation business or any of those businesses in that particular art form, what suggestions do you have for them?
Speaker 2: If you love what you do, then there's nothing that's going to stop you from doing it. People have often asked me, you know, "How do I get into the business?" And I say, "Well, if you want in, you'll get in. You'll find a way in." I've seen guys who were working out in the parking lot who wanted to be movie directors. They were in the parking lot, working in the parking lot, parking cars. And one day they became directors, because they wanted it. If you want it badly enough, you know, you'll get there. The second thing is learn everything you can, not just about what you're going to do, but learn as much as you can, because everything you learn is going to inform what you do; it's going to make you that much better.
Story_ID: 465802
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you've done already that you would have liked to have done differently? Or any regrets besides 'Toy Story'?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Oh, yeah. You know, as a creative person, there's always things left undone. And again, the most important projects for me are probably those I haven't done yet, you know. I can look back on a career of a lot of cool things, a lot of great movies, a lot of great books. But to me, the future is what's always exciting, what you haven't done. And I think Walt Disney felt the same way. Walt, Walt died a man not wanting to go, because this guy still had a lot left to do. He didn't want to go. His work wasn't finished. Unfortunately, his health shortened that career. So, I feel that moving forward--yeah, you can look back and say, "Yeah, I've done some great things, I've done some fun things." But it's what's ahead of you, that's what keeps me going.
Speaker 1: Now, when you, when you talk about values, you mention your family as being important.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And that pre-empts career.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But what other values do you consider important, and why would you consider those values important?
Speaker 2: Just being a decent person, treating people fairly, you know. I mean you can belong to any religion, and I've attended a number of religious services, you know, because it all, it all comes together. I mean it all comes back to one thing, you know, people treating other people decently. And that's what, that's what's really important. And if you do that, you're not going to have strife. If people would just treat each other, you know, decently, the world would be a better place.
Story_ID: 465803
Speaker 1: How do you want to be, to be remembered, and what do you want people most to say about you?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I would (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Or your legacy--
Speaker 2: My legacy--
Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't have any profound legacy to leave behind. I want people to say that I gave them a good time, you know, that, "I saw this movie that Floyd [HistoryMaker Floyd Norman] worked on, and boy, I sure had a laugh." Or, "I read this book that Floyd had written, and I just laughed my head off." Maybe basically I'm an entertainer, you know, I want to entertain people.
Story_ID: 465804
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: I would hope that we pull together as a people, because pulling together, that's what's going to give us strength. I saw what happened in the '60s [1960s]. I saw what happens when there's, you know, divisiveness and just a lack of coming together. Because I think we have so much to offer as a people, and we should be doing better than we are right now, we should be doing much better. I mean Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]--a film that I had an opportunity to work on when I did the story of his life, among others--I think he would want us to do better, and I think he might be somewhat disappointed the way things are today. Even though we've made progress, and to be sure, we've made progress, but not nearly enough.
Story_ID: 465805
Speaker 1: What is the importance of history, and knowledge of it?
Speaker 2: Ah, knowing history, knowing history. If you don't know it, you're going to be in trouble. And that's something I always try to emphasize, that, boy, if you don't know your history, you know, you're going to make the same mistakes (laughter) that were made in the past. You know, all you got to do is look back a few years, you know. And that's really the problem with so many things, I mean even about this country. If we knew more about our history, maybe we wouldn't do some of the dumb things we've done. So that applies to a person, to a nation, you know. Man, you got to know history. That's critical, that's so important. I can't emphasize that enough, knowing history. Boy, you better know it, or otherwise you're in big, big trouble.
Speaker 1: On that note, I want to thank you for this interview. Thank you for the life and the beauty that you've supplied over the years to us and myself, without me even knowing it. But now I know, and I want to thank you for that. Thank you for this interview, and we look forward to more from you in the future.
Speaker 2: It's been my pleasure.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Story_ID: 465806
Speaker 1: I said, "Wow, that this thing [Disney Legends award] is heavy."
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I'll help you (unclear) so we can see the magic castle.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): All right. Thank you.
