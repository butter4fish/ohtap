Speaker 1: Okay, before we get into depth, there are five 'People' magazine-ish type questions that I am compelled to ask you.  The first one is--and they just require a short answer--the first one is what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Oh, my favorite food.  That's hard, man, there's a lot of them. I like the New Orleans [Louisiana]-style food.  You know, Cajun food and well--I like that.  I like Asian food a lot.  My favorite, I don't know.  I'm crazy about soul food.  I like it all really.  I'm a--I'm a food lover.  Well, you can see I--I can afford to miss a few meals, but I like it all.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Fall.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Favorite vacation destination.  Oh boy, somewhere where the sun is shining, I guess. Hilton Head Island is very nice, South Carolina in the United States.  Out of the country, I guess, the Caribbean is very nice.  I don't know too much about way South America, but there's a few places in Mexico that I've been and were good.  But the favorite, I think, in the States would be Hilton Head Island, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Favorite phrase?  I used to say, "Can you dig it?" (laughs), you know, but now they say, "You understand, you understand?" (laughs).  It's changed.  I used to say "Can you dig it?" a lot, and--but, I've kind of gotten away from that too.  But that's a favorite phrase.  Favorite saying: "Always remember who you are and where you are in life."

Speaker 1: Let's talk about your early years, the beginnings of Eldee Young and your family.  Can you give us the names of your parents and spell those names for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Beatrice Clayton and the spelling of her name is Beatrice, B-E-A-T-R-I-C-E, Beatrice Clayton, C-L-A-Y-T-O-N.  That's her maiden name.  And my father's name is Walter E. Young.  You know, Walter, W-A-L-T-E-R, Young, Y-O-U-N-G.
Speaker 1: Okay, and when was your mother born and when was your father born?
Speaker 2: Well--.
Speaker 1: And where?
Speaker 2: Well, they were both born in--in Tennessee in an area called--in a small area right outside of Nashville, called Mount Pleasant, a little town called Mount Pleasant.  They were both born in like 1888 and somewhere around that time, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, now do they have a--do either--did either one of them, or do either one of them have stories about their ancestors--stories that go back to slavery or Reconstruction.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, well, I got--actually, I got more information from--from one of my aunts who's still living, my--one of my father's sisters, who's still living.  And she's--she's right now, Aunt Ethel is about--she's a little over a hundred right now.  And we used to--my sister and I used to go and visit her.  And one of my brothers used to interview her with a tape, which is somewhere in my house, I've got to find it.  But I sat and I spoke to her about our grandparents.  And--and my--my grandparents' parents and which go-- which back into slavery, you know.  And my mother on my--my grandmother on my father's side was a--she was just--she was born coming out of slavery, you know.  And my great-grandfather was killed trying to escape from the, you know, from the slave owners.  And I know about him, but I didn't know too much about my great-grandmother.  She spoke of her, but she didn't have much to say, you know.  She didn't remember too much about--she remembered the great-grandfather.
Speaker 1: Do you have any of their names?
Speaker 2: Oh, my great-grandfather's name.  He had a slave name that I don't even know.  I don't remember.  My great-grandfather, they used to call him Toby--Toby was his--the name they called him, Toby.
Speaker 1: Might be related to Alex Haley [writer/author of 'Roots']?
Speaker 2: (Laughs) I don't know.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Okay.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I don't know. It's got kind of close back in those days--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously, unclear).
Story_ID: 16108
Speaker 1: Great-grandfather on your father's [Walter Young's] side (unclear)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well, on my father's side, my grandfather [W. Goodrum] was white.  And I don't know too much about that family 'cause the name was Goodrum.  And we really carried my [sic, grand]mother's name, which is [Mary] Young.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) How do you spell--?
Speaker 2: Just like the drum, G-O-O-D-R-U-M, Goodrum.  And they--they were together during a time when it was illegal to marry--black and whites to marry in certain states in the United States.  It was still illegal, but they had a big family and a lot of--I had a lot of aunts and uncles from on my father's side, and on my mother's side too.  That was that long story I told you about the name.
Speaker 1: It's okay to tell the details.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: Did they have any real stories about the--.
Speaker 2: Well--well, they had stories about the farm.  We--there was a farm.  My grandfather had a farm set up for the family and everything there.  And this--in Tennessee.  They--and they worked that farm, my brothers and sister--my aunts and uncles, rather, worked that farm. They sent--well, my grandmother, rather, she sent two of her sons to school, to eventually come back.  One of them started the study of horticultural to help the--in raising crops and what not.  And my father studied to be a machinist to run machines and what not, you know.
Speaker 1: Where did they go to school?
Speaker 2: Somewhere there in the South.  I--it's like--it's like a finishing school, like going to college to--after high school and all of that.  It was somewhere down there in Tennessee, but I--they had to go away to school.  Of course, my father, he told me stories about--about the boarding, where they had to, you know, to live together--dorm that they lived in at that time.  But he used to tell me stories about that.
Speaker 1: What kind of--can you remember any of the stories?
Speaker 2: Well--well, you know, in those days, people used to carry pistols, you know.  And my father had a pistol. And some kind of way they--they were trying to get these--these guys, the soul brothers, not to carry no pistols in the school, you know, and what not--own any.  And he had to hide it in his shoe all the time, you know.  And he'd try to put his shoe on and forget his pistol was down in his shoe.  And he couldn't get his shoe on, you know, if somebody was watching.  'Cause he had to hide it, you know.  But in those days, it was--it was some difficult times for black men, you know, especially a young man like my father at that time, you know, who, you know, was--was mixed, you know.  So--.
Speaker 1: Yeah, did he really experience a lot of tough times?
Speaker 2: Not really because--in a way not really because my grandfather was very protective of the family in that area in the South.  They--his family was well-known there and they--they were a very well-known, well-to-do family, so to speak, in the area.  And so they didn't bother my--my brothers and--my aunts and uncles.  But they were--they worked like, you know, like, really like dogs on that farm from what I understand because that was the support.  After my grandfather passed, the farm went to my grandmother, but she had to--because of some legal matters, she had to pay for the farm again, you know.  So they all had to work very hard, you know, to pay for--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) This is the one whose husband was white?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And when he dies, then she has to pay for it again.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, because of the--the system at that time, you know, just was very rough.  You know, 'cause to get a lawyer to go in and go fight that--that thing, it was impossible at the time. So that she wound up paying for the property again.
Story_ID: 16109
Speaker 1: But in the meantime my father [Walter Young] was playing a little mandolin and guitar, when he could between--between working in that field, you know.
Speaker 2: So what kind of music did he play?
Speaker 1: The blues, you know, you had to play the blues in those days. They had--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I've got to ask.
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughs). Well, my father told me about some stories.  One of them is that they used to have like a little pool hall, juke joint, kind of a place that they used to go to.  And every once in a while there would be a traveling musician that would come through that little town in Mount Pleasant [Tennessee], you know.  And he'd go and--to wherever there was a joint and sit up and start playing guitar and what not.  And so the local musicians, some of them, when they were qualified, would sit in and they would play together, play music together.  And it was, you know, it was really based on all the blues, twelve-bar blues, eight-bar blues.  My father used to try show me how to tune a guitar different and everything.  Yeah, so--. That was a long time ago.
Speaker 2: So music runs in the family.
Speaker 1: Well, more or less.  I was the only that really--out of my brothers and sisters [Carl Young; Wilbert Young; Walter Young; Harold Young; Vermel Young, Aubrey Young; Donald Young], everybody studied a little bit of music.  But I was the only one that became a professional, out of--out of my group.  And then I--the only one.
Speaker 2: Did your mother [Beatrice Clayton Young] ever--and father ever tell you how they met?
Speaker 1: Well, only--only that he used to come by and always would be riding a big ol' mule or something.  And he'd come by where she lived and flirt all the time, you know.  But, you know, in those times, everybody's house was way over there or way over there, you know.  So when he would come by on this mule or horse, would come by there and--and flirt with her.  But they would--they would probably meet at church sometimes, you know.  But--but other than that, that was basically what they would tell me about him coming by to flirt.
Speaker 2: When did they come to Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Well--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) And why?
Speaker 1: Well, my father--well, he left--they left Mount Pleasant and moved I think to Indianapolis [Indiana].  And they stayed there for a while.  But he wasn't able to get that much work in his profession as a machinist.  And so he wanted to go some place where he could get into that, you know, more--there wasn't that much available there.  So he came to Chicago and before he could get a job, he opened up a pool hall.  And then he closed that down.  And he finally got a job doing--following his profession as a machinist.  So that's why--why they moved to Chicago.  And the majority of my brothers and sisters later were born in Chicago.  The early ones were--were born in Indianapolis and the South, in Tennessee.
Speaker 2: Well what did your mother do for a living?
Speaker 1: She was a housewife, a professional housewife.  She raised--well, there was really nine, but the first child died which was a--the first was a little baby girl.  She died when she was very young.  But following that was eight more kids.  I'm the seventh son, and I have one sister.  So you couldn't have a mother working that would have that many children.  And my father, he always brought that paycheck home.  So everybody had shoes and clothes and plenty to eat, you know.
Speaker 2: How many of you were there all together?  Now, you were the seventh son.
Speaker 1: There were eight, eight--.
Speaker 2: Eight (unclear).
Speaker 1: That we were raised together and one--one girl.  Seven boys and one girl.
Speaker 2: Okay and was the girl born after you?
Speaker 1: She's older--a little older than I--older than I.  I'm the last. I'm the last one.  And--the seventh son. That's supposed to mean something in the South.  He's supposed to look up in the sky and tell when it's gonna rain and all kind--there's a song about that, looking into a woman's eyes and tell when she has another man ['The Seventh Son,' Johnny Rivers].  I can't do that (laughs).  I think it's the seventh son of a seventh son.  But, whatever.
Speaker 2: That's pretty good.  I'm sure that people--.
Speaker 1: I should sing that blues though (laughs).
Speaker 2: "One, I'm the one."
Speaker 1: Yeah, "I'm the one, the one they call the seventh son."
Speaker 2: Did your elders make--make a big deal out of that, you being the seventh son?
Speaker 1: No, not really.  By the time I showed on the scene, that was--there was nothing new about having children around the house and raising them, except that my mother tried to keep me close, you know, and--and watch me.  She'd leave town to go visit her sisters or something, she'd always take me out of school for that and what not.  But there was nothing--nothing different in that sense, you know.  It's just, put the food on the table and come and get it, you know.  And she'd take care of you.  She was concerned about making sure that everybody went to school and my father was concerned about that, you know, an education and what not. And concerned about what--real endeavors.  'Cause it was a big deal for them to buy me a guitar.  The first instrument I--was a guitar. And an even bigger deal when I changed over to bass and they had to buy me a bass fiddle.  So in a family like that, that's a--that was a lot of--that was a big expenditure, you know.  But I don't know,  maybe they figured something out and knew that I was gonna make a living out of that stuff.
Story_ID: 16110
Speaker 1: Can you go back to your early childhood and--and tell me about some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up on the West Side [of Chicago, Illinois] in your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Oh, wow.  Wow, well, one--and when you're speaking of smells, the stockyard was still going.  And some days, when the wind would get just right, that stockyard wind would come through there and smell up the neighborhood.  It was really, really funky.  But luckily that didn't happen too often.  It would happen some, you know, like it'd be a summer day that would--that would happen.  But most of the times, it wasn't like that.  You know, it was--it was a--I don't know.  And those days, there was a sweetness in the air, you know, about the people in my neighborhood.  There was a real neighborhood in those days.  You know, all the neighbors knew you had kids in the neighborhood.  If--if you did something wrong and one of the other parents saw you, you were in trouble.  Sometimes the other parents would whup you, and then you'd get home and get another whupping, you know.  But it was a close--closer relationship in--in that sense.  And where I lived--I was brought up on--in the 2500 block on Washington [Avenue, Chicago, Illinois].  A few blocks over was Lake Street.  Now, Lake Street had--that's where they had the--the lounges and the clubs and what not.  And when I was very young, I used to--used to go down to an area called--on Lake Street--like Lake and Oakley [Street].  And there was a blues joint there.  And I can't think of the name of it right now.  It'll come to me later on: Silvio's, Silvio's--something like Silvio's.  This is where they'd have blues performance.  And I could stand outside the door, and I could see--peep in the door and maybe see Muddy Waters [blues musician] or some of the other guys in there playing, you know, and hear the--hear the music, live music.  Other than that, there were dance halls, you know, and what not.  And when I was just a, you know, like a child, that's where I used to go and hear stuff like that, some live music.  That was--that was great for me.  And when I got a little older, my brother was giving me guitar lessons.  So he used to take me to places to hear music, live music, when I got to be about ten years old. The first time I saw Duke Ellington [composer/musician], he took me downtown to the Chicago Theatre [Chicago, Illinois].  It was a big show, Duke Ellington and Josephine Baker [singer/dancer].  And it was a--it was really amazing, you know.
Speaker 1: That is amazing to (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was real fortunate to see that show 'cause that was her return to the United States at the time, after--after the war [World War II] and all of that.  She came back in the United States.  And--and that was like for--for me at ten years old, it was like eye candy to look up and hear that music from Duke Ellington, the shiny horns and the lights and everything, beautiful.  Then this beautiful, gorgeous woman came out on stage, and I told my brother [Carl Young], I said, "That's where I want to be, right on the bandstand with those guys."  But he used to take me, not only to that, but to hear local musicians, local bands and what not when there would be a big dance or something.  He'd drag me out and say, "Come on."  Sometimes he'd take me to a club where there was music, and I could stand--I couldn't go in there, the taverns, you know, but he'd take me outside, and we'd listen to some stuff together.  That's my oldest brother, Carl.
Speaker 1: Yeah, how old was he and how old were you?
Speaker 2: Well, at that time, he was, oh boy, I was about--when we started hanging out together and the guitar thing, I was about nine, ten years old.  And he was taking guitar lessons downtown, and he'd come home.  And he'd show me what he learned on the guitar at his lesson.  And I had my guitar and we would practice and sing together, about ten years old.  I guess my brother was in--in his twenties. He must have been--Carl was in his twenties 'cause he had children then.  I had little nieces that I used to keep for him every once in a while, but he had a family and what not at that time.  He was well into his twenties.
Speaker 1: Okay, tell me about some of the other activities that you engaged in?  What kind of things did you do when you were a kid?
Speaker 2: Oh, as a kid I--well, you know, I was just a--it was a regular kid's life until I really got into the music when I got into high school.  Before that it was just, you know, run and play and baseball and all of that stuff that kids would do in the neighborhood.  But by the time I got to high school, that's when I--I got involved in, really--into performing music because I took up the bass in order to get into the orchestra.  That's when my mother [Beatrice Clayton Young] passed, and bought me a bass--a bass fiddle.  They didn't have guitar in the orchestra so I took up bass.
Story_ID: 16111
Speaker 1: Where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: Over on the West Side [of Chicago, Illinois].  I went to Marshall [John Marshall Metropolitan High School] for one semester.  Then I went through the rest of the time--the rest of the time at McKinley High School [Chicago, Illinois], which had an orchestra and a band. I joined both of them.  I joined the orchestra, wound up playing bass, bass violin, with them.  And I taught myself how to play tuba so I could get into the band, the marching--the--the school band.  And I played tuba with them.  But--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Is that like playing the bass?
Speaker 2: It's similar, but it's--it's a lot rougher when you've got to huff and puff those notes out, you know.  And I couldn't play the--the sousaphone is the big one that wraps around your shoulder.  That was too big.  They had another tuba with a double B-flat which you'd sit in a chair and balance it, you know.  Now that one was the one I could play.  And the other one, I was too small.  I weighed 115 pounds in a wet overcoat at that time, you know.  So a sousaphone wrapped around that shoulder was a little bit too much for me. But--and that's another thing kept me from being a football hero.  I didn't weigh enough.  You had to weigh a 120 pounds to play football.
Speaker 1: You liked football?
Speaker 2: I--as a kid, yeah, I wanted to be a football hero, you know, and--but I was just too small and light. But I just--I just detoured and got into the music.  And we used to play for the--for the little affairs, like the home economics class. There was a piano player in the school.  We used to go and sing and play for the home economic class. And when they'd have a dance, sometimes we'd play for that.  And I had vocal group in high school, that didn't last, but I thought we were pretty good.  I thought we were pretty good. We used to sing and I'd play guitar.  And that was it.  I didn't have any other musicians with me.  And--but we sang a lot, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay, now just to back track a little bit, how did you like school?  Were you--.
Speaker 2: Oh, school was fun.  I loved it.  McKinley High School was great, and I loved school.  When I was a small kid, I was a very, very good student in--you know, I'd had very, very high marks when I was in grammar school up until high school.  And my--my marks started to drop when I was in high school 'cause I was having too much of a good time, and I was too busy.  I--I started playing professionally when I got into high school and started with that bass.  I got a job at a tavern when I was thirteen years old.  And that's when I started to--I started to smoke, you know, 'cause I wanted to look older, look like I belong in that tavern.  Everybody knew I was too young to be there. But they let me play there on weekends.  And then I used to take the bass, and I'd borrow the bass from school and--and go sit in with a friend of mine, King Kolax [William Little, jazz trumpeter/bandleader] had a band.  He'd let me sit in.  I don't know why he--he took mercy on a kid, and I learned a lot from him though 'cause I didn't know what--what the heck I was doing, you know. And--but he let me set in on weekends, Fridays and Saturdays.  They didn't have a bass with his group.  It was like drums, saxophone, trumpet and piano.  So he needed a bass player, but--and he got me for free.  So he--he let me play, and I--I learned a lot from that man.
Speaker 1: Okay, how do you spell his name?
Speaker 2: King--like king, K-I-N-G, Kolax, with a K, K-O-L-A-X.  Actually, King Kolax was--he was with a--I don't know--you may not be able to remember this, but Billy Eckstine [jazz singer/bandleader] had a big--big band at one time.  And King Kolax helped him form that big band and played trumpet in that band.  That was the band that had Charlie Parker [jazz saxophonist] and Dizzy Gillespie [jazz trumpeter], King Kolax was in the band and a lot of big name jazz players--bebop players was in that band with the Billy Eckstine band and Kolax was--was very influential in that band.  And he was a big influence on me.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: Okay, we're ready to continue. Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 1: During that time in high school, I also--I joined another band.  A guy named Tommy Mason, we used to play taverns up and down Madison Street [Chicago].  And we used to play for--for what they used to call shake dancers.  It was a club that had shake dancers (laughs). Well, they kept something on. There wasn't--you know, and I used to play for them and that was the way I saved up enough money to buy an old jalopy when I was in high school.  But--but Tommy Mason's band was a--a way I made money.  During the whole summer, I worked playing for shake dancers and what not.  Then finally I joined a band called the Cleffs, which was--which had a job every Friday night.  I used to go and sit in with them on guitar and play with this band every Friday.  Finally, the bass player had to go to the navy so I had--they needed a bass player, and so I joined as a bass player.  And this band was--was led more or less by a guy named Wallace Burton [jazz bandleader], who plays locally in Chicago now still, who became a mentor for me and also a teacher, you know, 'cause I learned a lot from Wallace Burton.  He was a very efficient musician.  He played horns, saxophone at the time.  And in that band was also the piano player, they called him Kirk Stuart [jazz pianist].  He wound up being the accompanist for people like Sarah Vaughan [jazz/popular music singer] and--what's the lady, she does the angels ['Touched by an Angel,' television drama series] now, the show--.
Speaker 2: Della Reese [singer/actress].
Speaker 1: Della Reese.  He was Della Reese's accompanist. Sarah Vaughan, and a lot of people.  His name was--it was Kirk Stuart.  And he was with that band.  When he left that band, then Ramsey Lewis [jazz composer/pianist] joined the band.  And [Isaac] 'Redd' Holt [jazz percussionist] was in the band.  So we worked together and, and played high school dances.  And we played this weekend thing every Friday at--at the Union Park on the West Side [Chicago].  And we--we really worked at the music with that band, and I learned a lot--I learned a lot from Wallace and from--and from that guy, Kirk Stuart before he left the band, you know.  It was a--it was a lot of fun.  It was a seven-piece band.  We had three saxophones--three saxophones, bass, drums, piano and guitar.  And I wound up being the bass player in the band though, you know. A bunch of great guys though.
Speaker 2: How did Burt spell his name?
Speaker 1: Burton, Wallace Burton, W-A-L-L-A-C-E, Burton, B-U-R-T-O-N.
Story_ID: 16112
Speaker 1: What did you see as the--the most challenging kinds of experiences in your early years as a musician--as a professional musician?
Speaker 2: As a professional musician, well, the variety of the music was the--a big challenge 'cause to play music in Chicago [Illinois], you had to be able to play everything from polkas to Latin music and all of that.  That was a challenge--a big challenge.  I think--when I--when I left Chicago--well, during that time, it was all working and studying music.  But I--I finally--when I--as soon as I got out of high school [McKinley High School, Chicago, Illinois], I left--left town playing with a blues band.  Now, that was a big challenge for me 'cause, for number one, I wanted to travel and play music.  So that was the one gig that I got on the road.  I didn't want to play the blues all the time.  I wanted to play bebop.  So I didn't realize it, but it was a really good learning period for me, and it was a challenge because that band worked hard.  And we used to work jobs where--where it was so hot and no air conditioning and all--we toured all in the South and what not.  And we had a wool suit with a nylon shirt was the uniform (whistles).  Boy, it was hot. I--and, but we would work.  The first set was two and one half hours long.  We played--and I wasn't used to that.  That was--to play the--play for two and one half hours straight.
Speaker 1: How old were you then?
Speaker 2: I was seventeen when I left with the band, but I made my eighteenth birthday--eighteen really.  And--well, I traveled with that band for over a year.  And finally, I--I couldn't take it anymore.  I had to learn something about bebop.  I had to get into jazz.  So I--I finally just thanked them very much and I went back home to study--came back to Chicago.  And that's when I went back to school to American Conservatory [of Music, Chicago, Illinois] and [Crane] Junior College [Chicago, Illinois] and studied.  And also Ramsey Lewis [jazz composer/pianist] was still around.  He hadn't gone into the service yet.  And so Ramsey Lewis and I formed a--a little group trio [The Ramsey Lewis Trio] and we were working different places.  And finally [Isaac] 'Redd' Holt [jazz percussionist] got out of the army and joined us.
Speaker 1: So your--most of your mentors and your learning experience in music took place outside of school?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes.
Speaker 1: Did you have any mentors at school at all--any teachers that stood out?
Speaker 2: Well, yes.  My--my teacher at--at the conservatory was very good.  He--not only did he--he'd teach me how to really control the bass, and he taught me theory.  (Unclear) studied two courses from him.  But also he used to want me to show him how to play my pizzicato technique, you know.  Well, he was a great teacher.  I'm trying to remember the gentleman's name.  Leonard.  I think his name was Dr.--Mr. Leonard.  And this was at the American Conservatory.
Speaker 1: Here in Chicago?
Speaker 2: Yes, here in Chicago.  And he was really--he--he turned out to be a very good--good friend in the music 'cause he was very patient with me, 'cause a lot of the homework, I didn't--I wouldn't bring it back.  And he'd studied--we'd study together, you know, and he--he'd show me all these things on the piano and what not, you know, and on the bass--how to control it.
Speaker 1: What is the pizzicato technique?  Am I pronouncing that correctly?
Speaker 2: Yes, pizzicato.  That's when you pick the bass.  And when you bow it, that's called arco--arco.  The technical term is arco, but picking is pizzicato.
Speaker 1: And normally in classical music, you bow the bass?
Speaker 2: Well, you bow--they have a pizzicato--they play pizzicato too, but--but it's a--it's a different style of playing from the jazz musicians that play.  When they play the pizzicato with--in the classical music, it's like--like this kind of an effect (demonstrates technique) you know, of enunciating each note with the bass fiddle.  But when playing jazz, it's a walking bass and it's a long lines, and a lot of times, it's faster.  So you've got to develop a technique to control that string, and--and yet and still get the volume, but yet and still get the--get the speed that was necessary.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you showed that technique to him?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: 'Cause he was a--more of a classical guy?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Story_ID: 16113
Speaker 1: There's a lot of curiousity--what it was like playing in the cabaret where the shake dancers--what was it like to be in that atmosphere?  What did it look like?  And what--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh, it was exciting.  Those days--it was like a playoff of a club they had here called the Club DeLisa [Chicago, Illinois]  which at that--during my time, they had a big band.  They had a complete show, you know, which consisted of a chorus line of dancers and what not and shake dancers among them.  And then they had comedians and then they'd have big-time singers and tap dancers, you know, that would put on shows.  There were a couple of guys called Dot and Dash that were really great tap dancers.  But these interpretive dancers, they would--was--interpretive dancing is--was a more classy way of saying it.  They were basically shake dancers.  So the smaller clubs where I was working would have like a show similar to that.  And the crowds would come in like on the weekends and what not.  And the place would be loaded and jumping with people that were just milling and laughing and having a good time because they always had a good comedian on.  The emcee was usually the comedian.  And he'd warm 'em up, and they'd bring out the different guys that performed.  And then they'd bring out the shake dancers, and we'd play for them.  And they usually had these real skimpy costumes on--not as skimpy as what they wear now, but they'd wear these costumes. They always wore something--something exotic, something flashy, you know.  And they were really great, you know, really great dancers.
Speaker 1: Can you remember the names of any of them--performers?
Speaker 2: I remember one named Tequila.
Speaker 1: Tequila--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Tequila.  She was a--well Tequila, now, she was like more like an interpretive dancer.  But she could also contort, you know.  That's, you know, make your leg go over this way and all of that, but she had a beautiful figure.  And I'm trying to think.  There was one that was back in those days and she's still around here in Chicago [Illinois].  She had a real small waist.  I'm trying to think of this girl's name.  It eludes me.  But Tequila was a--she was a fantastic dancer.  In fact, I did a tour through Ohio and she was on the show--wound up on the show with Della Reese [singer/actress] and Tequila and we had a band.  And there was a vocal group.  I can't remember, I think it was the Midnighters or one of those groups that was singing on the show.
Speaker 1: Hank Ballard [and the Midnighters]--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think they were--I think the Midnighters was on that show.  And they had a--a comedian emcee named Flash.  I remember that.  But we used to tour, but those--those clubs in Chicago were--were something else.  This--there was a place up on Madison Street.  The club was called Yammies--Yammies, and--and--.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: Man, I don't remember. Y-A-M-M-I-E-S, I guess, something like that.  But it was very popular on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois], you know.  And we used to do--had a lot of people who used to come to that club.  But it was amazing though, you know.  The--the clubs in those days, they were different, you know.  If you had a solid jazz club, they were quieter than they are now, you know, in the--in the real jazz clubs.  But on the West Side, we didn't--we had a few clubs and what not.  I used to play in an after-hours place at a hotel called the Sir--the Saint Charles Hotel [Chicago, Illinois], I believe it was.  And this was really funny though 'cause the job would start at 3 o'clock in the morning.  And I'd play from like 2:30, 3 o'clock in the morning till about 7 o'clock, 7:30 a.m.  This was--the after-hour joint was two guitars and a bass fiddle and we used to sing, you know.  I was still in high school at that time.
Speaker 1: And people were around to hear you (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh yes, we had people--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) At five, six o'clock in the morning?
Speaker 2: They were there and they were drinking and partying at that hour.  Monday, Blue Monday was a big day for--for partying, you know, Monday morning, early Monday morning.  You still had people out at those hours.  And the after-hours place, all kinds of things went on, of course, but it was basically the music that I was into.  And I'd go home and my mother [Beatrice Clayton Young] would fix me breakfast and I had to go to school.
Speaker 1: By all kinds of things going on, what do you mean?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, there were professional ladies in there--of the evening.  And they had another room somewhere in--in the hotel where there was some gambling going on, you know.  And they were shooting dice and what not.  And--and they also served some food.  There was fried chicken.  You could smell the chicken frying.  That was part of the atmosphere, you know.
Speaker 1: So you would go home from there to--to, you know,  family (unclear) (simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: Yes, and--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) And then go to school?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes.  Oh yes, I'd go to school.  I had to go to school.  My mother would fix me something--some breakfast, and--and I'd--I'd go to school, yes.  Had to.  That was a good period though, a lot of music.  I was learning a lot from those jobs and places, and from my brother [Carl Young] too.  My brother was still around, and he used to--he was still my main mentor, you know.  And he talked to me about a lot of things about--he used to--he took me to see one guy that was a bandleader named King Fleming [pianist/bandleader].  And he said, "Now, you've got to watch this guy."  I said, "Why?"  He says, "All he does--he doesn't drink.  He doesn't--do anything.  He just smokes a pipe.  He doesn't fool around with drugs or alcohol and he's a great musician.  And you got to watch--look out for this guy."  I still know this man.  He's still a friend of mine.  He's still around.  But my brother used to talk about that, you know, about not letting things control you, you know.  And to stay away from the drugs.
Speaker 1: He tried to give you a good example of (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh yes, this is--this was in--we were talking about in the early forties--late forties rather--late forties, when I was coming out of grammar school, you know.  And he talked about that because we had a lot of problems with drugs then.  They were focused on musicians, but a lot of people were using drugs during that time. But the--the focal point was--was, "Oh, if you're a musician, you're on drugs," you know.  And you were doing this.  Musicians had a bad rep, and playing jazz had a bad rep to it too at that time, you know.  But it was something that--my brother, you know, he--he just explained to me, you know, how stupid it was and how to stay away from it.  And if I wanted to really play any music, I had to stay away from that.
Story_ID: 16114
Speaker 1: That leads me to another question: how was life on the road like for you as a--as a seventeen year old?
Speaker 2: Oh, wow.  First of all, it was exciting to be traveling to all these different cities, you know, and what not--with this band of musicians, you know, and--and meeting people and playing all these--in these dances and halls--'cause we played mostly dances all along the way.  But we used to run into a lot of prejudice and problems, like where to stay.  We wound up usually staying in boarding houses and what not.  One big deal that used to really make me mad is we'd pull into a gas station, and we had a--at that time, we had like three cars.  The band was like a seven piece band with this blues group.  The guy's name--gentleman's name was Chuck Willis [R & B writer/performer].  He had a lot of hit records, blues records and a very good blues singer and great--.  And--but we--we'd stop in a gas station with three cars, and they would--he was very smart.  He'd tell the guy, "Fill 'em up," you know.  And--and he'd say, "Where are the restrooms?"  And the guy would say, "Well, we don't have a restroom for blacks," you know, "For negroes," we were negroes at that time and coloreds.  "We don't have a bathroom for coloreds."  So he'd say, "Well, forget about filling it up," you know.  And then he would explain, "Well, it's not my fault, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."  And then we'd go to another gas station.  But we had trouble with that--restaurants.  We'd want to stop and buy some food, you know, just some sandwiches or something--some food.  And you couldn't go and sit in certain restaurants.  You couldn't go in there.  You--some of them they'd let you go in and order food to go or they'd tell you to go around to the side, and you can order the food to go and what not,  but we couldn't sit in certain restaurants.  We couldn't check into certain hotels.  And we'd--although we--I wasn't making enough money to stay in anything fancy--but it was rough at that time.  But this guy, Chuck Willis, was very smart.  He was very clever--he and his brother.  They used to pull a bit--his brother played drums with the band--where he'd get to a town.  And he'd wear a turban, he and his brother.  And he was very dark skinned, you know.  And they'd get to one--and we'd be in one of these major cities.  And they'd go to a hotel to check in and the guy would say something to them.  And they'd start talking babbling (imitating an African language)  like they were talking African, speaking Swahili or something.  Neither one of them knew how to speak Swahili, but they would bamboozle these guys and get a room.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Would they get a room?
Speaker 2: They thought they were from Africa, you know.  And they were, you know, some sort of emissaries from Africa, they were well dressed, you know.  And they had the money, you know, and--for the rooms and what not.
Speaker 1: And these are the southern (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, they would--they could work this.  At certain hotels they got away with it, you know.
Speaker 1: What do you suppose the logic of that might be that they (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well, you know, just to--just to fool the Man.  Everything was like set, you know--it was a lot of prejudice, you know.  And--and it was just to have a big laugh on the Man, you know.
Speaker 1: Sure, I get that, but I mean what do you think the other side was thinking when they--why wouldn't--what difference would it make?  A turban or no turban?
Speaker 2: Well--well, the Africans were Africans, you know, and they didn't see too many Africans in the South or anywhere, you know, in the United States for that matter.  They didn't see too many Africans in those days.  And if they did come over, they thought they were like dignitaries or something, you know, that would be coming over.  And they couldn't insult them, you know, if they thought they were dignitaries and what not. That was the logic.  They were--but--see when you were colored or a negro, it's a different thing.  You couldn't get a room.  You couldn't even, you know, you go in the lobby and talk to them and before you could get--get it out, they were talking about "Get out of here," you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's really interesting thinking, how that--how people, you know, approach that race (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: It just--the logic was--was stupid, but the whole thing panned out eventually, you know. Martin Luther King [Jr.] and--and all of our Freedom Riders [civil rights activists integrating buses] and what not, you know, we straightened all of that jive out.  But at that time--like different drinking fountains, you know, you know, different areas to sit.  I remember when I was real small, my mother [Beatrice Clayton Young] had us visit her sisters in Nashville [Tennessee].  And my little cousin, she took me to a movie.  And we had to go around to the side of the building  and they had a stairwell where you could go up to the balcony.  But I--and I wasn't used to that from living in Chicago [Illinois], you know.  But that was my first exposure to that kind of stuff when I was just a small kid.  And I kept telling her, "Why can't we go to the front, why?"  And she's telling me, "Shut up (laughs).  We want to go see this movie."  If you wanted to see the movie, around the side.
Story_ID: 16115
Speaker 1: Now, when you were traveling when you were seventeen, that was about 1954, I guess?
Speaker 2: The exact year was 19--well, I started in '53 [1953], at the end of '53.  And I joined Chuck Willlis [R&B writer/performer] in '54.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--but when--you said when you came back and you went to the American Conservatory of Music [Chicago, Illinois] and studied--. What were your activities after that?  What were you doing?  You're continuing to play, right? In different groups and--.
Speaker 2: Well--well at that time, I came back and I had--I started a family.  I had a son [Eldevon Young] and wife [Barbara Young] and what not.  So I had to get a job, a day job.  And I went back to work.  I got a job working for the Social Security Administration.  And I was going to school at night to classes--taking classes at--at the conservatory on the weekends and [Crane] Junior College [Chicago, Illinois] at night.  And on the weekends is when I would play.  And Ramsey Lewis [jazz composer/pianist] and I would find gigs all over different places and--and play.  And we had a different drummer then, but as soon as [Isaac] 'Redd' Holt [jazz percussionist] left the army, he joined us.  But during that time we were marching around to different places, different clubs and what not.
Speaker 1: How did you meet Ramsey Lewis?
Speaker 2: Wallace Burton [jazz bandleader] introduced me to Ramsey Lewis 'cause when the piano player left the band, he replaced him with Ramsey Lewis, and--'cause Ramsey was at that time had been--they had been playing music in some church, and he was the piano player in the church.  And Wallace was the choir director.  So he brought him into the band and started playing with us.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he started off playing gospel music in some choir?
Speaker 2: Well--well, I think he really--he was studying classical music for a long time when he was very young.  And he was playing at his father's church, you know, playing the piano there.  So that's really how he started out.  And then he got introduced to jazz through Wallace Burton and this band called the Cleffs.
Speaker 1: Now, what about Redd Holt, did you know him before?
Speaker 2: No, I met him with that--well, I met him when I used to come to the jam sessions and sit in with that band when I was playing guitar.  That's when I met Redd Holt.  And he was a drummer with the Cleffs.  And he and--he and Wallace Burton now were the ones that formed that band called the Cleffs.  And that's how I met him, yes.
Speaker 1: Were you all about the same age or--?
Speaker 2: No, Redd--Redd has got me by about, I think three or four years difference--three or four years difference.  And--but we all, we--he was just, he was coming--when I met him, I was really into the middle of high school [McKinley High School, Chicago, Illinois] and--and getting involved in it.  And he had--he was getting ready to graduate.  So--but we were in that same band together with Wallace and the guys.  Most of the guys, in fact, are--were older than me except Ramsey.  Ramsey was--when he joined the band, he was the closest one to my age.  Everybody else was, you know, just a few years older than me, all young guys.
Speaker 1: So you all formed a trio [The Ramsey Lewis Trio], the three of you?
Speaker 2: Yes, actually when we formed the trio--and when Redd--that was when Redd Holt came out of the service--he joined us.  And that's when we really got to work on tightening the music up really tight.  And we really worked on the instrumental stuff all the time.  I used to sing a little bit with the group, but then when we worked on the music, it was just straight music.  And we worked very hard on it.  We finally got a job at some nice clubs and what not, and we met [Holmes] 'Daddy-O' Daylie [radio personality/entrepreneur] who became our manager.  And we got into a real nice club on the North Side [Chicago] called the SRO and we played there.  And Daddy-O used to bring different people over to meet us, you know, and to hear us. But--the first time I ever met Ray Brown, the great jazz bass player, Ray Brown.  I met Dizzy Gillespie [jazz trumpeter] and different people.  But they were--they would come by, and some of them would give us some help.  You know, and others would just come and listen, you know.  I met Stan Getz [jazz saxophonist] there and different guys like that, you know.
Speaker 1: Just for the record, can you explain, I guess, more about who Daddy-O Daylie is in Chicago?
Speaker 2: Okay, Daddy-O Daylie was the--was really the top jazz disc jockey in the Chicago--at that time.  This was like in the--in the mid fifties, and he had been one of the top disc jockeys for many years.  He was on WMAQ [-AM, 670, Chicago, Illinois], at the time.  And he was a--he was a great influence for jazz in Chicago.  And he knew all--where all the bodies were buried with the jazz that ensued--in association with jazz.  He's the one that had that phrase, "I--I want to play the music for those that live--live it, love it and make a living of it". That was his--his phrase.  He used to rhyme.  Daddy-O used to rhyme a lot of things when he would speak on his program.  He was very--very good disc jockey.  In fact, a couple of guys had--had written songs for him.  I think--I think [Julian] 'Cannonball' [Adderley] wrote one called well here's 'One for Daddy-O.'  And a couple of guys--different groups wrote music for Daddy--had songs for him, Daddy-O Daylie.  He was a great guy, really, and a very interesting character.  I--I think he's still living, but he's--he moved over in Michigan somewhere.  That reminds me.  I'm gonna try and see if I can find Daddy-O. He was a great man, really, great influence for us.  He got us our--got us--we had a recording that was done at Chess Records.  But he got them to release the record, and he started playing it on his program.  And he used to interview us.  He taught us how to--to do an interview when we were doing the interviews on radio and what not.  And he exposed us to people like--he took us to--he was really great.  He--Nat King Cole [jazz singer/pianist] came to town [Chicago] one time.  And this is a short story.  And he had a press interview, press conference, and what not going on.  And Daddy-O, got us in on it.  So we got a chance to meet Nat King Cole and to talk with him.  And--and at the time, Daddy-O explained to him--told him that we were a young group getting--just getting--getting our stuff started and what not.  And Nat King Cole gave us some advice about the business, you know, how to control the crowds, you know, and not to worry about the volume, how to control the sound in the room, you know, and different things--how to control your audiences.
Speaker 1: What did he say about the volume?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, he--he had a phrase that--when the crowd gets a little noisy, he said, "You don't--" he said, "You don't whip your audience by being vulgar or--or saying bad things to your audience."  He said, "You can say--make a phrase like: 'Ladies and gentlemen, you can give me a break.  Even a train stops--give me a little break, and I'm gonna try and sing some nice songs for you.'"  He was a very pleasant man, a very beautiful man, the way he'd phrase things, you know.  But if I was in the audience and he was talking to me like that, I'd have to sit down and say, "Wait a minute, maybe this guy's got something to say," and listen to him.  He's--he was very great in handling his audiences in night clubs and what not. A very great man.
Story_ID: 16116
Speaker 1: What other tips did Nat King Cole [jazz singer/pianist] give you?  You said there were about three different tips he--.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah--he also--well, he talked about the audience--controlling the audience and the sound, and the, you know--. And also he talked about controlling your affairs, keeping everything--keep your business together, keep everything clean, you know.  Just like when Nat King Cole--there was never any scandals or anything involving Nat King Cole and--and never anything subversive about him--in any way, you know.  But he was--he was an influential man anyway, very influential in the--in the music--not--not just the music, but also, you know, so many people followed him, you know, his--his career, you know, and the way he handled things, you know.  He was a very great man.
Speaker 1: Everybody--I mean, people considered him as cool and gracious gentleman--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes, yes, yes.  His singing was--was extremely palatable.  Now, I knew singers like--at the time, that had a--well, a better voice, a stronger--the phrase we use in the business is "better pipes."  Now, [Billy] Eckstine [jazz singer/bandleader] had great pipes--great pipes, you know, his sound, you know, the resonance, and how he could hit those notes and everything and his range was great, you know.  But Nat King Cole had that palatable sound, you know, that you could listen to all day long, you know.  You know, he--he'd sing 'Unforgettable,' and you're just--have you swaying along with him, you know.  Everything he did was good.  And when I was a kid, you know, they used to try to get people to--they'd try to get 'em to play the record before you'd buy it.  And they used to have these 78s [rpm] and what not.  And then they went to 45s [rpm]. But when Nat King Cole's records come out, you didn't ask to play it: "Is a new Nat King Cole record out?  Give it to me," 'cause you knew it was gonna be done well.  You didn't have to listen to it.  You know--or hear it.  You know, you just buy it automatically.  His music was that great.
Story_ID: 16117
Speaker 1: [Holmes] 'Daddy-O' Daylie is helping you all [with Ramsey Lewis, jazz composer/pianist and Isaac 'Redd' Holt, jazz percussionist] get together.  Had you named your trio yet?
Speaker 2: No. Well, at that time, when we got with Daddy-O, we hadn't named the group and what not.  We didn't have a name.  It was just "the trio" and, you know, "those guys," you know, or something.  But--'cause we worked even--Ramsey and I worked one job and they put on the billboard, "Straight from Trinidad," so we were playing calypso music all night long.  It's this--we wore these crazy shirts--oh, that was--we wore crazy shirts.  But when we got with Daddy-O and they released the first record, he said, "Well, you ought to have a classy name.  And you don't want to use certain phrases," you know.  And we said, "Okay, we'll call it the--we'll call you the Gentlemen of Jazz."  And the first album we put out--and that was the title of it, 'The Gentlemen of Jazz.'  That was the trio's name.  And he said, "Well--." And there was a little connotation about jazz--a little stigmatation [sic, stigmatization] to the word, 'jazz.'  So the next album that came out, we were called 'The Gentlemen of Swing,' you know.  Okay, all right.  Well, we were giving it a shot.  So finally, we were talking to Daddy-O, and said, "Well listen, you don't want them to expect to, you know--to anticipate you so much.  We want--you want people to come out and just to listen to you, you know.  Now, if you have certain names, they would expect you to play rock 'n roll.  If you call yourselves the--The Watermelons or The Crazy People, then that's got to be rock 'n roll or something or--or use one of those phrases, The Blues Boys or, you know, whatever, that had--you know, you knew what it is.  But if you use a person's name, then they have to say, 'Well, who is this?  Okay, let's see what they're doing,'" you know.  And he--and Daddy-O said, "Well, everybody thinks the piano player is the leader of the band anyway so we'll--and Ramsey's name sounds good.  So we'll call it 'The Ramsey Lewis Trio.'"  And at that time, we did--I didn't, you know--I said, "Well it doesn't make any difference to me," you know, 'cause at that time we were all like brothers.  We would eat off the same plate and everything, so--. So to name the group Ramsey Lewis didn't mean any difference.  We were still partners, you know.  The money was still split up and the workload was all still split up.  You know, we were all working on the music and everything.  So then--that's why we called it The Ramsey Lewis Trio.  And that continued until we broke up.
Story_ID: 16118
Speaker 1: When I first heard of The Ramsey Lewis Trio in Dayton, Ohio on WING [1410 AM], a song called 'The In Crowd' [1965].
Speaker 2: Oh, yes--that's a good story on that too.
Speaker 1: You want to talk about that or am I going too fast?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  With The Ramsey Lewis Trio [Eldee Young, jazz bassist; Ramsey Lewis, jazz composer/pianist; Isaac 'Redd' Holt, jazz percussionist], we--we--as I said, we worked hard on the music and everything.  And we were trying a lot of different stuff, experimenting with stuff on records and what not.  We did an album with folk music.  We did an album with--called 'Country Meets the Blues.'  You know, we did some country songs and got--and blues, cowboys songs, and then 'My Bucket's Got a Hole in it.'  And 'High Noon.'  We did 'High Noon' on that (singing musical imitation), a jazz version of that.  We were trying a lot of stuff.  So we said, "Well, we're gonna do something--." [Holmes] 'Daddy-O' [Daylie] was talking about: "Do something live," you know.  We said, "Well, okay, we'll get something live."  We recorded in a club in Washington, D.C. live.  We did one album, and it--it was fairly successful, but it didn't really make it.  So we were gonna try it again.  And we were getting ready to do the session the next day or something and we were in a bar hanging out.  And this bar--there's a barmaid in there.  I'll never forget,  her name was Nettie Gray.  And she--we were talking about--"Well, we're getting ready to do this recording session," and what not.  And she said, "Well there's this new song.  You ought to record this.  You ought to record this song."  We said, "Aw, well, you know?"  She said, "Wait a minute.  I'll play it for you."  She put a quarter in the box or whatever and played this record, 'The In Crowd' for us, by Dobie Gray [singer/songwriter].  And she said, "Now, da doo dodo (musical imitation)." (Unclear) We said, "Well, maybe we ought to try that anyway, so what the heck?" So the next day, we put together a quick arrangement on it.  And--and we recorded it at the session.  And that was the--the hit record.  But she was the one who came up with idea.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Was it a live recording?
Speaker 2: Yeah, live.  It was done live at this club in Washington, D.C. called the Caves, down on U Street.  And we had--well, at that time, we were drawing pretty good crowds.  And the room was crowded and everybody was with us.  And it was like a--it was--they used to use this phrase: "It was a happening".  If you wanted to be anywhere, you wanted to be at the recording session.  You couldn't get into the club it was just so many people that were in there, you know, that weekend.
Speaker 1: Now that I recall there was a clinking of glasses--.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: And people clapping in the background.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And noises and--.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah. It was a lot of--a lot of different sounds and things.  And--and when I play the cello, they would do--make noises and what not, you know, and say, "Yeah, I know what he meant by that," you know.
Speaker 1: Right, people were talking.  And this may be--was this the first cut to be played on--'cause you all were on Top 40 [list of hit records] stations.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Cut made the Top 40.  And--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It was the first cut that I remember--I don't know if this was the first one--with a live audience.  You could hear the ambiance of the--of the jazz set.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  Well, we--we weren't the first at doing that, but we were--we were early at what--at doing this type of thing because we were a jazz, basically, a jazz group.  And here we were doing--performing an R & B, Top 40 tune, which--which became what they call a crossover, you know.  It was played on all kinds of stations, some of the jazz stations still played it, but also the R & B [rhythm and blues] Top 40 stations played it too.  So that's how it became a hit.  And Dizzy Gillespie [jazz trumpeter] years later, he said, "You guys are the ones that started fusion (laughs)," you know, which is like the fusing--fusing of jazz and R & B or, you know, rock 'n roll together.  That's fusion music, you know.  But I don't think we were--were the very first ones to do it.  I don't remember anybody that was doing that stuff, but we got into it and we--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) I think it was the first time that something like that was on the Top 40.
Speaker 2: I think so.  That was it.
Speaker 1: There were other live jazz albums, I know, but the first time a cut made the Top 40--.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: And I was in a small midwestern city in Dayton and it was on the Top 40 in Dayton, Ohio.

Speaker 1: The guy that preceded us [The Ramsey Lewis Trio: Eldee Young, jazz bassist; Ramsey Lewis, jazz composer/pianist; Isaac 'Redd' Holt, jazz percussionist] with the record company  [Argo/Cadet label] was Ahmad Jamal [jazz pianist].  And he had a very successful record just before us which was the--the 'But Not for Me' album, which was a live album recorded over on the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] at the Pershing Lounge.  But, it--it was a jazz album as such and it didn't get as much crossover as we got.  But it was--it--it sold great.  His album sold for years and years, you know, a great album.  He's a great musician, Ahmad Jamal, 'cause I remember him years ago.  He had a little playing locally in Chicago.  But that's--that's another thing,  it was--and I didn't get into that so much because--but during the fifties, there were a lot of great stars that--that I didn't realize they were gonna become as great--as well-known--that were just floating around and working and, you know--getting their skills together and what not.  [Big] Joe Williams [blues guitarist/songwriter], I used to play for Joe Williams in blues clubs years ago.  And this is way before he got with Count Basie [jazz pianist].  He was singing locally here in Chicago.  And he became a big star.  Ahmad Jamal, a big star, you know, different guys like that, you know. And it was--it was a--well, Chicago, really--we were talking about the atmosphere in Chicago.  The atmosphere for music in Chicago was the best.  I think the best in the world because a lot of musicians came to Chicago from other parts of the country to get their skills together and to get a chance to tighten their game up.  And then maybe later on they wound up in New York or something like that--New York.  But Chicago had a lot of live music going on--different clubs, after-hours clubs and--and there were places to play.  You know, 63rd Street [Chicago] used to be called the 'Street of Dreams.'  They had clubs all up and down 63rd Street--blues clubs, jazz clubs, everything. Sixty-third [Street] and Cottage Grove [Avenue], I was--I was hanging out with a drummer, a professional drummer, a guy I knew named Hobbs at the time.  And he said, "Come on and go with me.  I'm going to sit in with these different clubs, and you'll get a chance to meet these guys.  Maybe they won't let you sit in, but at least you'll get a chance to see 'em."  So I hung out with him one night over there.  And we went from club to club, right in that area.  And he sat in about--at about three different clubs, sat in on the drums 'cause they knew Hobbs. He was a great drummer.  And I got a chance to see all these people that were performing all around in this area.  And they were great.  Gene Ammons [jazz saxophonist] was over there--well, so many guys.  Sonny Stitt [jazz saxophonist] was playing some place and every--it was a lot of--just a lot of really great clubs--a lot of little clubs where you could get your skills together.  They weren't paying a whole lot of money, but they were--they were clubs where you--you had a chance to play the music, you know.  And if you really played it, then you could get the people's ear and attention, you know.  So you had to learn how to do that, you know, to play for people--very important.  So Chicago was really like a--even--well, go back even further--Louis Armstrong [jazz trumpeter] came to Chicago and this is where he became really famous.  He really became famous--he really skyrocketed after he came to Chicago from New Orleans [Louisiana], you know.  And so many--so many musicians passed through here on their way up (points upward).
Story_ID: 16120
Speaker 1: You're saying then that live performance, I mean, getting that feedback from people and being able to play to people--.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Is extremely important in developing your talent.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  It's--it's--it's--music--it's--there's a lot of pleasure and--for being able to play the instrument, you know, 'cause I can get pleasure from playing it for myself and what not.  But the big shot is when you--when you play your music and you reach out and you touch somebody with your music, really, you know, make them stop and start patting their foot, you know, or make them smile or make them laugh about something cute that you played or slick that you play or something emotional that you play.  I've only had that experience once when I played--was playing cello one time in Detroit [Michigan] and I was--was playing a spiritual.  And there was a--a little older lady that was in the audience.  And she started to cry because that tune touched her, you know.  And I--I can't blame it all on my skills, but it was the fact that I knew the tune, and played it at that time, you know.  So I felt good about it, to be able to touch her like that, you know, with just a song.  And music is like that.  It--it touches everybody's lives.  It's--when we have movies, you gotta have background music.  When you go and you're driving in your car, you put music on to kill the boredom of just driving along long highways.  When you get at home, when you want to change your mood, you--you got the blues, you--you want to play something to pick you up.  You play a certain kind of jazz, you know, or this kind of music or this kind of music.  You're romantic--when you're romantic, you play some music, you know.  They used to call Johnny Mathis [pop singer] and Frank Sinatra [singer] the romantic stuff, you know, the make-out music.  You know, they call it make-out music.  Romantic stuff, you listen to Nat King Cole [jazz singer/pianist] sing one of those pretty love songs, and you feel romantic, you know.  It's the feeling, the passion, and--and it's the way you play it.  Live, I've--I--I really--I'm not so much excited about recording as I am performing for people, where I can look out and see them and--and mentally touch them with the music.  Oh, I can get something going.  And it doesn't have to be the whole audience at one time, just maybe a few people or one person.  All of a sudden, they--they feel like the music is doing something.  They've got to pat their foot or rock in their chair while I'm playing, you know. Or they'll--I'll play something and they'll smile, you know. After you get through, sometimes you get the applause, sometimes they--they don't.  But they--they feel--you got 'em, you know, 'cause they're looking up at you smiling.  But sometimes, you know, when the--when the wind is right, you can get a whole audience.  And that's--that is a phenomenal feeling, that they're with what you're doing, you know, and they appreciate it to the point where they give you the applause, and--and you walk off the stage and you have to come back and do some more.  And you walk off and you have to come back and do some more.  They really love your music, you know.  At--at one time with--[Isaac] 'Redd' Holt [jazz percussionist] and I had a group called--you know, the Young-Holt Unlimited thing.  We had a trio, three musicians [Eldee Young, jazz bassist; Redd Holt; and Hysear Don Walker, jazz pianist] and Ken Chaney from Chicago [Illinois] was playing with us.
Speaker 1: Piano player.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and we went to--we went to Montreux Jazz Festival with the trio with Ken Chaney on piano.  And we did a concert--outdoor concert after the festival was over in Geneva--in Geneva, Switzerland.  And we had something like three encores, you know.  And they were still wanting us to come back, you know.  And we'd come back and play another song.  They loved that and they go (growl sound), "Come back and play some more," you know, 'cause the audience, they were really into what we were doing.  That's 'cause the gods were right--the music gods were: "Oh, you got 'em," you know.  That's what to do, you know, you gave them the right thing.  You know, it--it happens, you know, and sometimes you--you'll play something and people start to stand up, you know, and applaud for you.  It's a good feeling.  It's a good feeling.  It's a good one--like I said, from somebody just sit there quietly and smile and give you that nod, like "Yeah, I know what you're doing, and I appreciate it, you know, got an idea of what's happening with that," because--'cause music, a lot of times, you don't have to understand it, you just got to feel it, you know, you got to feel it--that--the passion.  You know, when people listen to Billie Holiday [jazz singer], you know, it's just that you can--you can hear it in her voice, and you feel that, you know, inside, you know, when she's singing one of them songs, you know.  It's--it's important.  It's important to the musicians or the--the entertainer that's doing it, you know, the singer. Music, it's--it's everywhere.  You know, it's--it's part of our lives now, of everybody in the world.  It's not necessarily jazz.  It's not necessarily pop music.  It could be classical music or cowboy music that turns them on, you know, that--that does for them.  It's the music, music, music.  And I love all music, you know, all kinds.  If I had my druthers, I'd rather play bebop (laughs) and sing real romantic songs--and which I do most of the times.  But I'm kind of like Count Basie [jazz pianist],  I'll--I'll do three for you, and then I'll do one for me.  But it's--it's the music.
Story_ID: 16121
Speaker 1: Let's pick up the story of the trio [The Ramsey Lewis Trio: Eldee Young, jazz bassist; Ramsey Lewis, jazz composer/pianist; Isaac 'Redd' Holt, jazz percussionist], you know.  I guess, you know, after 'The In Crowd' was released, that was a big--first big hit, right?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, first big hit.
Speaker 1: So--what happened? You all became--.
Speaker 2: Well, things happen.  We recorded another--one more album together after that in Los Angeles [California].  Oh yeah, we recorded another album in--'The In Crowd' was around 1955 [sic, 1965], '54 [1954, sic 1964], '55 .  And we recorded another album live in a club out in California called The Lighthouse.  It was called 'Hang on Ramsey.'  And we recorded 'Hang on Sloopy,' which was successful for us also.  And after that we were--we were having difficulties.  I don't know.  They always say that brothers, sometimes you can--you can suffer very well together, but success--we can't stand success very well together.  And there was a lot of outside influences and what not.  Anyway, but when the deal went down, we separated and Ramsey went his way.  And Redd and I went another way.  And Redd and I formed a group called Young-Holt Unlimited, and--which we had a couple of hit records with that one.  And we did a lot of television with that group.  With Young-Holt, we did even more television than we did with Ramsey.  We did some popular shows with Ramsey, like the Johnny Carsons [comedian/late night talk show host] and what not, but with Young-Holt Unlimited, we--we had our hit record called 'The Soulful Strut' and a thing called the 'Wack Wack'--'Wack-Wack.'  It was very successful for us.  And we wound up--we wound up playing with the last Fred Astaire Special.  And we played for Fred Astaire [actor/dancer], you know.  And we gave an interpretation of a tune called 'Mellow Yellow,' and he danced to it on television.  I don't have a copy of the tape.  I was--I was supposed to find out if I can get a copy of that 'cause it's--it was a big deal to me to meet the man, meet Fred Astaire, who was a gentleman and a great listener too.  But, he was a nice man and that was big deal.  But we did that.  We did 'The Steve Allen Show,' 'The Mike Douglas Show.'  We did a lot of local television in different places, stations.  And we did a movie, we were in a movie for television.  And we were doing quite a--quite a--we stayed quite busy.  But then we started going around and around in circles and playing the same clubs and things.  And I got uptight.  I wanted to come home and quit.  And so I finally quit the Young-Holt Unlimited and came home to Chicago [Illinois] to--to study some more and get myself together, clean myself up again, you know, and get a fresh start on it, which I did.
Story_ID: 16122
Speaker 1: How did you--your family fare with all the traveling--.
Speaker 2: Well, my kids [Eldevon Young, Tyree Young, Marcus Young]--that's the--that's all they knew was music around the house. Me practicing the bass in the house and entertainers, different--different musicians coming to the house. Ray Brown [jazz bassist] and Ed Thigpen [jazz drummer] and different stars.  Nancy Wilson [jazz, popular music singer/actress] used to come to the house for parties.  I used to throw parties and the kids came up with all of this.  And they knew where I was going, you know.  Then I'd be gone for short periods of time and--on three weeks, four weeks, maybe a month. And go and come back--go and come back.  They were used to that.  And--and that was the environment they were in, but I was--you know, when I was home, I was daddy.  And they used to follow me all the time when they were little. Everywhere I'd go, when I'd come home, they'd follow me, and wait outside the bathroom door until I came out (laughs).  They thought I was gonna try to escape or something without taking them for a ride in the car, you know.  They used to follow me a lot when they were young.
Speaker 1: How many kids?
Speaker 2: Oh, I have three sons--three sons.  And--and I have one daughter, outside of--with another lady.  I have a daughter.  But I raised--raised the sons.  I never raised the daughter.  We're close though, but I raised the sons, the three guys.  And they're--they're up there.  They're older than me I think sometimes (laughs).
Story_ID: 16123
Speaker 1: It seems unusual (unclear)--it's not all the time that a group splits up and everybody remains successful [in reference to the break-up of The Ramsey Lewis Trio: Ramsey Lewis, jazz composer/pianist; Eldee Young, jazz bassist; Isaac 'Redd' Holt, jazz percussionist].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, that's true.
Speaker 1: And, I mean, I took note of that back in those days, watching you all 'cause Young-Holt Unlimited was very successful.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, we did a--we played a lot of shows. We traveled quite a bit.  We did a lot of colleges too with that group.  And we had some great combinations too, that we changed--we changed musicians.  We had a guy with us one time named Bobby Lyle [jazz pianist] playing piano and a--and a singer named William [Billy] Valentine [rhythm and blues singer].  And that was a combination that I thought if we had developed--enlarged and developed it and started writing some original music, we could have done a lot with.  Bobby Lyle, right now he's a--he was the accompanist for--oh, what's her name?  Bette Midler [singer/actress].  He accompanied Bette Midler.  He also played for the--that other jazz singer.  Oh boy, I always have trouble calling his name, not Bobby McFerrin [jazz vocalist/a cappella singer], oh boy, I can't think of his name.
Speaker 1: Al Jarreau [jazz vocalist]?
Speaker 2: Al Jarreau.  He was the musical director for Al Jarreau, doing television, videos and all of that.  Great piano player--great.  And now he's got his own recordings out where he's playing and singing.  But there's a lot of--of things that could have been done with that combination.  This fellow William Valentine was a very passionate--passionate singer.  And he could reach out and touch the girls--the ladies liked him.  And he used to wear what I call his ice cream suit, which was a white suit.  He looked great in it, you know.  And he would sing.  Sometimes we'd do R & B tunes with him, you know, and he would interpret them.  And he'd sing things like, (singing) "I'll go down on my knees for you".  And me and Bobby and William Valentine would drop to our knees that time.  The girls would scream 'cause we would do--we were doing like an R & B thing, you know.  But that wasn't really what I wanted to be into--I wanted to go jazz, but it was a successful thing for us at the time.  We mixed everything up.  And I think that was one of the problems that our managers and agents had with us.  Because we were playing--we were jazz musicians, and we could play R & B. We wound up being the opening act for Aretha Franklin [soul singer], traveling with her as an opening act.  We opened a few shows for--a show for James Brown [soul singer], for Charles--and Charles Brown, you know--Ray Charles [R & B, blues singer/pianist], I'm sorry.  Ray Charles--we were opening act for him.  Also, we were the opening act at the Apollo Theater for R & B programs.  They put us right smack dab in the middle of an R & B show as the opening act.  And we were instrumentalists.  We'd come out and play at the Apollo Theater, Howard at--Apollo in [Harlem] New York, Howard [University] in Washington, D.C., and the Regal Theater here in Chicago.  We were the opening act for all of these R & B performers, you know.  And it was a lot of fun, but--but they didn't know what to do with us, you know.  They'd say, "Oh, these guys are jazz." "Well, no--no, they're--they're R & B--" they didn't know which way to go with us, with the music.  So it was a little confusing.  But the thing about it--the point that we made and I--I wanted to make and which we did make, is that in performing, we play for everybody, you know.  We'd play jazz tunes.  We would play an R--interpret an R & B song, you know.  And we sang.  We--we entertained.  We tried to reach out and touch people.  And it was successful in that sense, but the agents and managers didn't know what really to do with us.
Speaker 1: Well, it seemed like you were always working, you know (unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, we worked.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)  I mean, people couldn't pigeon-hole you.
Speaker 2: No, it--that was the hard part.  I think if we had revamped and did another group configuration with the music and--and enhanced that group that we had with Bobby Lyle and William Valentine, it could have been very successful because William was a very--was a very good singer.  And Bobby and myself and Redd, we used to background sing for him, all in a group, you know.  And it was--it was good, you know, it was good.  It could have been much more successful, but things happen, you know.
Speaker 1: You think it should have been--you think that you all should have--would have been more successful if defined as R & B?
Speaker 2: Well, now they call it fusion.  If we were interpreted as a fusion group or--or a crossover band or something.  I don't know how to--how it should have really worked, but I know that we would have had music for everybody--people to dance to and for people to just sit and listen to, and also for the instrumental enthusiasts who want to hear musicians that can get over the instrument, 'cause Bobby could--he could play the piano--play the hell out of the piano.  He's a great piano player.  And Redd was--is great on his drums, you know, and everything.  So we--we were able to interpret--jazz interpretations as well as these  R & B things, you know.  And--but it was a bit confusing for people.
Story_ID: 16124
Speaker 1: What are your favorite, I guess--what are your favorite moments from your years as a performer?
Speaker 2: Oh, favorite moments.  I don't know.  It had to be at--well, my favorite moments were, basically--that happened often--was meeting and playing music with my--my heroes.  You got to understand, when I was young, I used to go to the jazz at the Phil [Philharmonic, sic, Civic Opera House, Chicago, Illinois] and watch them guys at--at the [Civic] Opera House here--at the jazz at the Philharmonic perform.  And these guys were my heroes.  And Duke Ellington's [composer/musician] a hero and Nat King Cole [jazz singer/pianist].  I got a chance to meet these guys and some of them to play music with them.  One defining moment: there's a great bass player, he--he passed away not too long ago [2000], named Milt Hinton--very successful, very great bass player.  He used to invite guys over to his house.  One day we had--we were invited over his house--one night, you know, to have a little something to eat and then have a little booze.  So he got behind the bar and he gave me one of his bass fiddles. And we were there together, and we had started a jam session.  We had Ben Webster [jazz tenor] on saxophone, [Julian] 'Cannonball' Adderley's [jazz saxophonist] whole group was there and Ramsey [Lewis, composer/jazz pianist] and--and Joe Zawinul [jazz fusion musician] on piano.  And we played music.  And I tried to get Milt to play the bass, and he said, "I'm pouring the whiskey, you guys--you play the--the bass," you know.  We played 'Come Sunday,' a Duke Ellington tune.  The first time I ever played that, you know, was with Ben Webster, and he was--it was just a--a good feeling.  We just played some bebop and some good music, played the blues and some things.  And it was a great moment for me, you know, to be able to play some music with my heroes.  Cannonball Adderley, great, and Ben Webster--at the same time, in the same room--oh, it was phenomenal.  I also got a chance to play duets, jam sessions with Ray Brown [jazz bassist].  There's another--he just passed away incidentally [2002], and he was like a--a great friend.  And I never told him he was one of my heroes.  We used to joke and kid and play golf together all the time, you know, when we got a chance rather.  But we used to play duets together and stuff, you know.  And it was meeting people like that--to shake Duke Ellington's hand and--and, you know, and pass a few words with him, you know, it's--it's something, you know.
Speaker 1: What was Duke Ellington like?
Speaker 2: He's a gentleman, you know.  He was so smooth--all the time smooth, you know, and always had that--that look about him, you know, like he's happy.  You know, he's doing something--he--he looked like, when he'd just walk around, he looked like music.  You know, he looked like he was flowing, you know, like the music, you know.  And you meet him, and he'd say--he was so gracious, you know.  "Hey, glad to meet you."  "My pleasure. It'd be my pleasure to meet you", you know, or something like that.  He's--he was, I don't know.  His character would never come back again like that, you know.  You know, and he'd phrase it like, you know, "I love you madly" (laughs).  He was great, he was great.
Speaker 1: What about Cannonball Adderley?
Speaker 2: Cannonball is--he's a great guy.  Cannonball was a school teacher that--he cancelled out teaching and became such a great performer.  But you could sit and talk to him, and it was almost like sitting in the class some time.  And we used to do--we were doing a show together.  And we used to go across from the theater to a place, a lady's house that used to cook food, family-style, and we'd sit there and eat.  One day we sat there, and I didn't leave the table--all--everybody in the show had finally left, but Cannonball and I were sitting there talking, you know, and still eating. I got back to the place, I was so full, I fell out because I sat there, and I just wanted to sit and listen to Cannonball, you know--you know, espousing about music and about life, maybe politics or whatever, you know. It was funny, we used to do that sometimes in the dressing rooms, you know, just have discussions with people.  Apollo Theater [New York]--we used to--a lot of different people used to come to the Apollo Theater--come backstage. Sidney Poitier [actor/ambassador] came back-- he used to come around the theater.
Story_ID: 16125
Speaker 1: As I was saying, Sidney Poitier [actor/ambassador] and other people used to stop by.  One time a friend of mine named Bill Henderson--he's a jazz singer and movie actor now--he brought a guy by named--by the name of Bill also--Bill Cosby. Who nobody had ever heard of before, and brought him up to the dressing room and say, "Hey, this is--" introducing, "Hey, this is Bill Cosby, man, he's--he's a real great comedian, blah, blah, blah, blah," you know and everything.  "He's gonna be a great big success."  So we went in the room and we're talking and chatting and blah, blah, blah, blah.  Finally, I pulled Bill Henderson over to the side, and I said, "Hey, man, come here.  I've got to tell you something."  He said, "What?"  I said, "Man, this cat, Bill Cosby," I said, "He ain't gone make it, man.  He's not gonna make it."  Bill Henderson said, "What do you mean he's not gonna make it?"  I said, "Man, he's been here a half an hour, and he ain't said nothing funny yet.  He ain't said a funny thing yet."  'Cause I was used to Redd Foxx [comedian] on the shows that would do it.  And Redd Foxx was funny all the time, on stage, off stage, sitting in a restaurant, on an airplane.  He was funny all the time.  So when I met Bill Cosby, I thought he was supposed to be like, you know, like Redd Foxx, funny all the time.  And I'm talking about, "He's not gonna make it."  I think I--I had a--that was bad judgment on my part (laughs).  It was terrible, but I'm--I haven't told Bill Cosby about that yet.  He's still a friend though. He's still a friend.
Story_ID: 16126
Speaker 1: Tell us about the time when you first came off the road and came home [Chicago, Illinois] and what you were feeling?
Speaker 2: First, I want to straighten out that--that '[The] In Crowd' hit was in 1965, not 1955.  Well, when I--I came off the road with the--with the, I think it was the first time with--from the blues--with the blues, I went back to school.  I explained that.  But when I left the road coming off of--with Young-Holt Unlimited, it was--it was a transitional stage for me in many ways.  For one, I--I didn't want to lead a band or even co-lead a band.  I wanted to work locally and with different guys here in Chicago.  And it didn't work out so well for me for a while because most of the guys had been used to me always having a group.  And they'd ask me, "Oh, you got a job for me."  And I'm talking about, "You got a job for me?"  So finally, it sank in, and I started working with different local musicians and what not and started interpreting music and what not.  And I found that I wound up having to get my own group again, you know.  And that's when I started putting together trios for engagements and quartets and what not.  And I wound up on Rush Street [Chicago] at a place called the Back Room.  And I was playing there and--with different musicians that would join me and what not.  And we were--I found out that I had to go back to something that I had started out with as a kid.  I had to start singing more.  So I started singing more and entertaining more at that time.  But at the same time, I found that--I grew into a thing that I--showed up that I didn't want to happen.  I--I became an alcoholic.  And I realized it at that time and finally I said, "Something's got to be done."  My wife [Barbara Young]  tried to get me to stop,  everybody--. Finally, the Creator, God just took his hand out and said, "Hey, man, you've got to stop doing this."  So I put myself into a hospital for three weeks and after that I came out and--under a little therapy for a while. I used to go to AA [Alcoholics Anonymous, alcoholism program] meetings and what not.  And then I--I finally got it to--got control of that, and I haven't had a drink in about twenty--make a short--long story short, I haven't had a drink for about twenty-five years, maybe over that--over twenty-five years.
Speaker 1: What made you stop, you know?
Speaker 2: Stop drinking?
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: I--the only thing I can think is the Creator.
Speaker 1: Was there an incident or something that happened that (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: No, not--not at--well, just one day I was out with a friend of mine in the car, and he said, "You know, this is--is a--they have a clinic in here for alcoholics.  You ought to go in there and talk to them," you know.  And I said, "Ah man--" he said, "You ought go in."  I said, "Okay, just for a lark."  So I went in and I talked to the guy.  And he said, "Well, you can commit yourself and blah, blah, blah.  You have insurance. You can come in here and do this and--" you know.  And I said, "Well, I'll be right back."  He said, "Why do you have to leave?"  You know.  And I said, "Well, I've got to go home and get some pajamas, don't I?" Yeah, some BS that I came up with, and he said, "No, you're just shucking and jiving."  He said, "If you go out the door, you're not gonna come back."  And that was it.  I said, "Ah, okay, you may be right."  So I stayed.  And the only thing I can think is that--that God just touched me and said, "Hey, man, it's time for you to get your act completely cleaned up."  So it was very good for me at that time because I--I finally got a chance to go back to really playing the music and singing.  And after that, things started getting better and better for me.  There were things that happened while I was there at the hospital that I started to try and get myself let out of the hospital because they were doing--filming a thing on bass players, and they wanted me to be in on it.  And then I said, "Which is important, cleaning up your act or doing a--."  And I decided to stay.  But it was--it was good for me to do that.  I needed to do that in order to continue.  You know, if I'm gonna be a hundred and--well, I guess I'll go to 125 years old, I've got to--I can't do it drinking.
Speaker 1: And did you reach a stage where you realized that you were an alcoholic or something?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Because I've heard that, and I was just--you know, you hear that people drink and they don't really realize that they're drinking too much until something happens and they figure it out.
Speaker 2: Well, you find yourself losing control, you know.  That's when you know you've--it's got you.  You know, you wind up drinking in the morning. One thing that really made me--let me know that I lost it, I had a black out.  I--I used to leave this job on Western [Avenue, Chicago] and I'd get my car and drive home.  Well, I got home and I was sitting in the kitchen and I was thinking, I said, "Which way did I drive home, which street?"  I--just trying to remember which street did I drive down.  I couldn't remember what street I had driven down coming home.  I'd just come home. Couldn't remember how I got home, you know.  Now, that's--that's got to be deep. And there was one defining moment when I got the shakes one morning, one--early afternoon.  And I got the shakes.  And that let me know.  Oh, I was going on Rush Street to collect some money and I had to wait.  So I walked into this bar.  And there was nobody in the bar except the bartender, myself and there was another guy across the bar from me.  You know, it was like a round bar where they--and he said, "Hey Eldee--how you doing?"  He said, "Get Eldee a drink on me."  So the bartender poured me a drink and what not.  And I went to pick it up and my hand was like that (demonstrates shaking hands).  It was shaking, shaking.  And I said, "Wait a minute now.  This--this is too much."  I said, "Let me get myself straightened out here."  And the only way that I'd calm my jangled nerves down is that I had to drink the drink with a straw at the bar.  And then finally after that first drink, I calmed down.  But I--I knew that, this is out of control.  This is just--this is just stupid.  It's the wrong thing.  I know this is something my brother never thought I'd be involved in.  It's something that I felt--it snuck up on me, you know.  But it was happening.  When it was happening, I--I didn't realize, and I always denied it.  You go through a denial thing.  But then sometimes, you--you, if you get to yourself and you start talking to yourself:  "Hey, wait a minute, you know, what's happening with this?"  You know, and then the Creator say, "Hey, fool (laughs), you're doing something real wrong here.  Straighten up."  You know, and so I had to do something about it.  I wanted to play some more music. And I thought I was gonna--I would--if I had followed that road, I was gonna kill myself early, you know.  I had--I had avoided drugs like the plague, but I didn't realize I wasn't avoiding alcohol like the plague or handling it, controlling it, you know.  See now I've got control over that.  That makes a difference, you know.  I'm still crazy about food though.
Speaker 1: So how--you say you're gonna live to 125?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's good enough--that's good enough.  Then I think I might retire and get a ukulele, you know, and go to some beach somewhere with a straw hat.  And I won't play requests--better not ask me about a request (laughs).  It'll work.

Speaker 1: Did your parents get a chance to see you become successful?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother [Beatrice Clayton Young] didn't 'cause she passed away after I had graduated from high school [McKinley High School, Chicago, Illinois].  She was--she had passed away before I went on the road.  But my father [Walter Young]--my father did.  My father got a chance to come to a club where I was playing and hear me and--and what not.  And finally, I was able to buy a house.  And he came by the house and helped me work on the yard and all that kind of stuff, you know.  That was a big deal for me to own a home, you know, 'cause--and so he got a chance to see what was happening before he passed away, you know.
Speaker 1: What about your brother?
Speaker 2: Carl passed away--many years ago.  He was the one that I--I miss a lot.  I think about him a lot, you know.  But my other brothers that were around, they knew about me and used to--well, I used to give them some CDs [compact discs] and stuff.  And we'd talk about things around the house and we'd have family get-togethers every once in a while, you know, before all of them passed away.  They--I got a chance--they got a chance to hear me on different occasions, on TV shows and--and they'd come out to the clubs sometimes where I'm playing, you know, to let me perform for them, to find out if I played as good as Carl (laughs).  So they knew.
Story_ID: 16128
Speaker 1: What do you see as your legacy?
Speaker 2: As--as a legacy, I--I think just making the music happy, you know.  I think everybody that--that's known me over the years know that I've always been happy about the--when I'm playing music.  And I've tried to project that in the music and--and having fun with the music.  You got to enjoy what you're doing.  You've got to enjoy the music.  You've got to enjoy playing for people.  And I think that's really about it.  A legacy is just enjoying life and the music, you know, enjoying performing for people.  I like playing different instruments.  I like the cello.  I really enjoy playing the cello--performing too, and the bass, but these were things that--that maybe helped me reach out and touch people, the different instruments, you know, and the happiness, the being able to play it and play it a little different from somebody else, you know; just to play it the way I want to play it, which is--is with some humor and a little--you had to have dexterity on the instruments to play them anyway, but a certain amount of dexterity, but a certain amount of--a lot of passion and a big, big chunk of humor in what you're doing, you know, 'cause you got to be able to smile about that stuff, you know, at times--when you're playing the bebop and the things. And--and the passion in singing a real nice love song or a song that's got some words that mean something to it.  There's one on that CD [compact disc] there that's called, 'This is All I Ask.'  And it's got that--that passionate thing about what happens, you know, in life, you know, growing older.  And the lyrics are very nice on it, you know.  And--and the opening line--"As I--as I approach the prime of my life, I find I have the time of my life learning to enjoy at my leisure, all of the simple pleasures."  And then it says--then the "Happily every [sic, "so I happily concede"], this is all I ask, this is all I need."  And the lines in that--you can put a little passion behind that.  That's the thing--that's the story, you know, that's the only legacy, I mean, just touching people with music, you know.  So many other musicians have come before me that did it so well, you know, so well.  And they're heroes of mine and probably a lot of other people too, you know.  But that's--that's the only legacy that I have is that, you know, the--the thought of the music, you know.  No matter what happens, if you--you know, I used to come to work sometime with a headache and it would go away after I played the first song, you know.  And I think that's one of the blessings that comes with being able to perform music, you know, is that you can--you can go into the music and leave everything else.
Story_ID: 16129
Speaker 1: Most of your success occurred during a time period where black people were really engaged in the civil rights struggle--.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: And how did that affect your music, and--or do you think--or how did the music affect that?
Speaker 2: Well--well, for one thing, whenever we got a chance to do a benefit show that involved the [Civil Rights] Movement, we were involved in it.  And we used our music as best we could in these--in these instances, 'cause that's all we had to offer, you know, really, because I'm--we weren't political leaders.  We didn't have the--the ability to get up on the stage like a [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr., reverend/civil rights leader] or--or Medgar Evers [civil rights activist] and talk to these people, you know.  But other people could, so we'd like to help them.  We tried to avail ourselves of these people, different politicians. Medgar Evers' brother, Charles Evers [mayor, Fayette, Mississippi/civil rights activist], was running for--for governor of Mississippi.  But we let him know that if he needed us for anything, we were there to play for him--play the music for him.  And after he lost the election, he had a party, you know, and we played for it, you know.  We wished it would have been a success party, but it wasn't.  But--but he still kept his spirits up and what not.  But other politicians, we've done things like that.  I played at the [the Congressional] Black Caucus in Washington, D.C.  And these things that--only things that I could use is my music involving in these things in the movement, to change things in the United States politically, you know, to make things happen.  It's not just for--for black people, for everybody, you know.  I really believe that Charles Evers could have been a great governor for Mississippi 'cause he would have done something for that--that state, brought businesses and--and efforts and things to that state that never came, you know.  Maybe they're doing it now, but I don't know.  I don't think so.  At that time, they needed a Medgar Evers in Mississippi.  But it's so many things that would happen. I used to run into Bill Cosby doing benefit shows.  He used to do a lot of them.  We'd be on the same shows together.  We used to play places like Detroit [Michigan], at Cobo Hall or what not.  But other entertainers were like that--to use their abilities in any way they could--well, the only way is in performing--to draw crowds and attention to the--to the Movement or to help a cause, you know.  And also we did it for medical purposes too--when there was something going on, we would do that too--do benefits for those.
Story_ID: 16130
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and aspirations for the black community?
Speaker 2: To become a real community. To get more unity and--and be--be more defining politically.  Better--get better activities in the politics, you know. Better unity in controlling their neighborhoods from gangs and problems.  We have a problem right now in Chicago [Illinois], a thing that kicked off that should never have happened, this thing on the South Side [Chicago], where these two guys got killed, you know, by a mob [in reference to: beating to death of two men who jumped a curb and injured pedestrians, Oakland community, Chicago, August 2, 2002]. That's--I don't know, that's bad--that's bad. That we should have people that--that feel that--so strongly that they--and have--don't have the ability to really interpret what they're doing, you know, to think, "Well, the best way that I--only way that I can react to this guy is to--to beat him to death," you know. When actually, all they could have done was just to make sure they stayed there to be arrested by the law, you know, and be a witness to his, mis--his wrongdoing as far as his driving.  The community needs to come together more.  They need to be more defining in the businesses.  They need to be--we need to be harder on ourselves again.  You know, this thing about, you know, how people used to say, "Well, we always have to do it better, we always have to be stronger.  We have to do faster, better, stronger," you know.  Well, now is the time to do that.  We have to be better now.  We have to--we have to judge ourselves harder, you know.  And instead of--laying back, "Well, we shouldn't have to do that.  We should--you know, we shouldn't have to do it. We'll slog along like everybody else."  No, you can't do that now.  Black people can't do that--cannot--need not do that.  We need a--we need a little renaissance on education.  At one time I remember there was a thing going in like Atlanta, Georgia.  When we were playing in Atlanta, Georgia, where all the kids I talked to, their aspiration was to go to college.  We were in a college atmosphere.  There were so many colleges down there, Brown [Morris Brown College, Atlanta] and Spelman [College, Atlanta] and what not.  And this was an atmosphere of education, which is where we should be--still be, you know; to avail ourselves of anything that's available education-wise.  I remember something I read a long time ago about the Jews in the United States.  This is in their early times.  When they couldn't get into the universities, the free universities and what not, they would go and sit at the campus and study with the kids that were in school, you know, study--prepare themselves, you know.  This is that--that drive, that aspiration, wanting, you know, to get the--get it together.  And the only--well, not the only thing, but one of the most important things is education, you know, and--and unity as far as being able to have a force together.  I--I was--the big excitement was Harold Washington [mayor, Chicago,1983-1987].  I--I thought he was the greatest thing since popcorn, you know.  And the legacy that he left behind has kind of fell apart and it shouldn't have, because we didn't have the cohesiveness within the--the group that he left behind, you know.  And this is what we've got to get again, that cohesiveness.  Maybe we--maybe it can be found through different leaders, new leaders that have a real sense of what's happening now.  2002 is different.  It's a new ball game going on now.  It's not the same as it was in 19--1950 and 1954 when I was running up and down that highway, not able to go to a bathroom or go into a restaurant.  It's a different thing.  I couldn't check in the hotels--a different game now.  It's a different thing.  It's a different type of consistency we need about what we're doing as a people.  And--and it's not just for the black people.  It's--when--when things are right for the black people, it's right for everybody.  Everybody has a shot, you know.  It'll wake up the whole United States.  I think it's--it's--'cause we have to think in terms of everybody.  Now, Harold Washington did.  He thought in terms of everybody, you know.  He wasn't just the mayor of--black people's mayor.  He was the mayor of Chicago. I liked that. I liked that. He spread it around like you do music, you know.  You throw it out there and play it for them, and you don't care, you just want some ears, you know, to hear and enjoy it.  And he was doing something political, he was spreading it around.  He was just putting it out there.  This is the way we should--maybe straighten the city out and get some things done, you know.  And he was getting it done--very proud of that man.

Speaker 1: What's it like traveling in the far East?  You perform a lot in Singapore--.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And other places in the far East.  How's that been for you?
Speaker 2: It's great really.  For the last fifteen years or so, I've been going back and forth to southeast Asia, in particular Singapore.  Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia--.
Speaker 1: Australia too, right?
Speaker 2: Australia, Hong Kong.  I've been to--I've been to Beijing [China]--so many places in--in Asia that I--now, I'm playing in Thailand a lot where the king--actually, the king of Thailand [Bhumibol Adulyadej] is a jazz musician.  He played alto.  He likes to write songs too.  But Asia is a--it's a whole new world for me jazz-wise because parts of Asia haven't been brought along--like Japan is very, very much up to date on jazz.  They're real jazz enthusiasts, and they're up to date on the music and whatever happening with the  R & B [rhythm and blues music], the pop field, rap music, all that.  Japan is on it.  Singapore is next.  It's coming in.  It's got good jazz clubs and a lot of people are involved with it in the music end of it.  So I get very good reception in these places, but I've found places--when I got a chance to play Indonesia, the people just loved music, you know.  And they just--they used to go away and they'd come back, and they'd bring their families with them and sit in the club.  And if I was playing in a hotel, they'd bring their kids and what not, you know, to listen to the music and what not.  This is Indonesia.  And some areas where I'd play in Asia and they look at me: "What the hell did he mean by that?"  And they give me that kind of look, but I found out that if I can just keep them there sitting in that seat long enough, I'll find something that they're gonna like, you know.  I'll reach out and touch them with something, you know.  And you can, you just keep feeling around with the music.  You're gonna touch something, you know, and play a variety of tunes, you know.  You play some bebop. You play some blues.  You take a pop tune and re-interpret it in your way--own way.  Or you make a joke out of something, and you get the attention to--of the people, you know, 'cause I found out that--that you can be an entertainer and musician too, you know, cause they go hand-in-hand.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I found it out by using that--I kind of peaked my popularity in certain areas over in Asia.  In Singapore, they know me for doing commercials and singing commercials and--and different stuff.
Speaker 1: What kind of commercials do you do?
Speaker 2: I did a McDonald's [fast food corporation] commercial over there, with a West Indian accent (laughs).  That was--that was funny.  And then I did a commercial for an ice cream company and a bank.  And I did one where a video thing for--for the hotel and all the--all the restaurants in there where I sang to the--the--they gave me the script for it and I did to 'Food, Glorious Food,' you know, introducing all these restaurant facilities in the hotel area.  And I opened up with bassing--playing some scatting music, and then I sang about these different things in the place, and they showed the clubs--the restaurants.  And at the end, I just stopped and spun the bass around, you know, and started laughing.  And after that when I go into a store in a town--in Singapore they say, "I know you from somewhere. You the guy, do the bass like that," (imitates Asian accent, imitates spinning the bass), you know.  But popularity in that area came--in Singapore came pretty easy for me in that sense.  But it's--like in Bangkok [Thailand] now, it's coming.  It's doing very well.  It's piecing together because, like I said--the king over there was--is a jazz musician, so the music is already planted there basically.  So you just got--I just have to keep reaching out and touching them with songs and what not.  And just keep the music happy, you know, 'cause you get too serious and what not, they'll think, "Oh oh, something's gonna happen," you know.  And maybe we're playing spooky music.  Well, I don't want to play spooky music.  I want--I'd rather play something happy, you know.  You know, and it gets to people. But Asia, it's like a new area.  It's wonderful really.  Wonderful.
Story_ID: 16132
Speaker 1: This is slightly different from the legacy question, but I know you've got sixty-five more years to go or so, but how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As a good, happy musician--entertainer.  That's it, you know.  If they can remember that I'm happy and kept the music happy, you know, that's--that's good enough. That's good enough. They don't have to remember me as a technician or anything like that or as a recording artist.  If they can remember--they caught Eldee Young at some place, you know, playing music or they saw me somewhere, you know, 'cause that's--that's what I like more than recording or anything.  I like to play for people direct, where they're there, and I get a chance to see them and walk off the stage and shake a hand or two, and--you know, sing 'Happy Birthday' to somebody, you know. Or play an anniversary song and I get a couple up to dance to, you know.  I'd just like them to remember me as a--as a happy-going musician, that made them have a good time.

Speaker 1: I've got four big basses like this.  One I leave over in Asia, in Singapore--in--in Bangkok.  I leave that there--over there, and three of them I have at the house.  This one I don't take out as much as I used to because it's--it's a little delicate.  And it's a very expensive instrument now.  The price on these daggon things have gone through the ceiling, but I've got a smaller bass that I--a little bit more portable, but it's a regular bass fiddle. This is in the ice cream suit with--again with Fat Girl--my girlfriend, bass.

This is a different shot, positions of me, with--playing pizzicato and up in the right side, bowing.  And he put that--put the little collage together like this.  At the bottom, it says something about "Back at the Apollo [Theater, Harlem, New York] by popular demand."  Yeah.  Doc Anderson wrote some nice things on the bottom there.

And it shows more--that's the way I used to set up with my cello, where I could lay my bass down and grab-- pick up the cello, and then play that for a while and then put it back on that chair, 'cause I used to have to sit down to play that cello.  But this shows--it's another Apollo, but this time it's with Young-Holt Unlimited again.

And I used to play all four of those at different, for different songs, you know.  I was confused a lot 'cause I'd have to--after I finished one song, I'd say "What, what do I grab next?"
