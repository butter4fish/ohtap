Story_ID: 663430
Speaker 1: All right.  So, I'm gonna start with your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side, but we'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Gussie, G-U-S-S-I-E, Ree, R-E-E, Palmer, P-A-L-M-E-R [Gussie Palmer].
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Oh, July 28th--oh, shoot.  My mother is eighty-five.  Her place of birth is Fisher, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay.  F-I-S--
Speaker 2: H-E-R.
Speaker 1: H-E-R?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace the ancestors on that side?  Are there stories?
Speaker 2: I think the interesting thing is that my mother was an only child.  She grew up in a small town of Louisiana.  After being born in Fisher, she moved--they moved to Many, Louisiana, M-A-N-Y, and that's--you know, she loved sports.  She played in--basketball in high school.  My mom--she didn't go to college.  She ended up marrying my dad [James Palmer, Jr.] when she was eighteen years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In, in Louisiana?
Speaker 2: In Louisiana, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, what were your mother's aspirations I guess when she was younger?  Did she--
Speaker 2: Well, I--of course, the, the one thing that I know, she loved sports.  She loved her family.  And, of course, when she met my father, her family was--became her first and one and only priority.
Story_ID: 663431
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: James, J-A-M-E-S, Leroy, L-E-R-O-Y, Palmer, P-A-L-M-E-R [James Palmer, Jr.].
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My dad passed away two years ago.  He was eighty-eight.  He had a, he had a long time battle with Parkinson's disease.  And his birthday is October 8th.  And he, again--he also was born in Fisher, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so, what can you tell us about your father's side of the family?  What are the stories from that side?
Speaker 2: My father was the third child of nine.  And what's interesting about him, he was actually named after my grandfather [James Palmer, Sr.].  So, my father was a junior.  Kind of like the head of his family.  You know, he was pretty much one of the leaders.  If anything was going on in his family, they pretty much looked at, looked at--to my father to either solve the problem or take care of something.  I think the most interesting thing for him was he was a, a huge sport fan.  He ended up going to Grambling University [Grambling College; Grambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana], played baseball and, of course, loved basketball.  Again, being raised in Louisiana, he also moved to Many, Louisiana.  My mother [Gussie Palmer] and father met each other.  Of course, they were childhood friends and they ended up marrying each other.  What was interesting was, out of all my dad's siblings, he was the only one to pack up his family and move to California.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: To Los Angeles, California.
Speaker 1: Is there--is there a story about why he decided to move to Los Angeles?
Speaker 2: Well, it really came from my mother.  I think my mother just felt like the country was not where she wanted to raise her children.  She wanted just for them to be able to experience a lot more things than probably than what she had to experience.  I think one main reason was with my mother being an only child, her mother and father had actually moved to California as well and that was another strong reason why she wanted to move to California.  And sure enough, my dad didn't disagree, so he, of course, came to California, found a job.  And at that time, I, I wasn't born; it's just my older sister was born at that point in time.  I think she was three or maybe five.  Went back to Louisiana, packed up his family, and moved to California.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, they had an anchor here with your grandparents being here already, right?
Speaker 2: A small anchor just pretty much because on my mother's side, she had two aunts that were living in Northern California in the Berkeley [California]--in the Berkeley area so, of course, that was kind of a, a little root area where they started.  But once my dad actually came down here, he ended up finding work in Los Angeles.  And Los Angeles was where we all ended up being raised and have lived here for the rest--for, of course, my entire life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, did you live in Los Angeles when you grew up or Compton (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, it was really--well, we--I would--of course, the, the place where we grew up in, where my mother and father still have the same home is in Compton, California.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Story_ID: 663432
Speaker 1: Now, when you think about--well, I just want to go back and just ask you this.  So, there are no stories about Louisiana that are in your family about where--how your parents [Gussie Palmer and James Palmer, Jr.] grew up or whether they were on a farm or what kind of occupations they had or, or I mean, their, their parents or their ancestors or (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I think for my--on my dad's side, they did have a small farm [in Fisher, Louisiana], not really anything really big.  I mean, of course, as a kid growing up, we would actually go back and visit, you know, my grandparents, my aunts and uncles.  I think what's the most interesting thing about--especially on my father's side is that all except for one were all teachers.  Yes, my--
Speaker 1: That is significant.
Speaker 2: Yeah, very, very significant.  They were all school teachers.  One--I have one uncle who was in the [U.S.] Army and made that--he was a lifer.  And--but everyone else except for my father were all school teachers.  So, I find that totally interesting, just that my father, you know, he out of the--out of all his siblings, him and his, his younger brother, they were the only two that were not in education.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did he finish Grambling [Grambling College; Grambling State University, Grambling, Louisiana] when he was there?
Speaker 2: No, he actually--I think he went two years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's significant, though, that you even--that you go to college, you know, and finish two years.  What did he--what did he want to do?  Did he--well, was he going to school to be a teacher, too, or--
Speaker 2: No.  He wasn't.  He wasn't.  It was--he ended up being a furnace operator for Lattice Pacific division [ph.].  And, of course, he worked for Lattice for I want to say thirty-six years before he retired, which I think was probably a phenomenal feat.  But I think the most interesting thing with my mother and father, of course, growing up together.  It's interesting because my mother used to always tell the stories that how she was--my dad's two sisters or three sisters, that they were very, very close friends.  So, you know, it was almost like a, a, a close knit--my mother was very, very close to my father's family and just end, end up--so happens end up marrying, marrying him.  But, they definitely grew up together during childhood.  On my mother's side of the family, did a little bit of farming as well but, of course, once my grandparents--you know, with me being as young as we were, didn't visit my grandparents in Louisiana because they end up moving here to Los Angeles [California], so not--don't have a lot of information as far as what they did in Louisiana, but having a little more information what my father--what my father's side of the family did because we would always pack the car up and every summer or Christmas, drive to the country and spend two or three weeks, you know, and which was probably a treat for us being born here in Los Ang- being in California.  We just loved it.  We thought it was one of the best things in the world to do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Well, you know, that, that--the era that your parents moved out of Louisiana, a lot of black folks were moving out of the South, you know, because of racial tension, lack of opportunities or, you know, a lot of people have like deep roots there, you know, like your family would go--you know, would go back.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But--so, they never talked about--
Speaker 2: Well, no, they--definitely having the deep roots there, but I think looking at--looking back on it, they definitely wanted more for my--myself, my brother [Rod Palmer], and my two sisters.  That was probably one of the most important reasons why they decided to now move from the country to the city, just giving us a little more opportunities, not that--you know, I can honestly say, looking at my nieces and nephews, they were extremely successful.  But, looking at my career and looking at my brother, my nephew, my sister, how well we've done here in California.  I can honestly say that I know that that was definitely one of the reasons to get us out of the country just because they just thought that we would have a lot more opportunities.
Story_ID: 663433
Speaker 1: Now, now, when you think about your parents' personalities, their dispositions, what they look like, their opinions, their sense of humor, how they walk, how they talk, who do you think that you take after the most?
Speaker 2: You know, I have a little bit of both.  I have a little bit of both parents.  My father [James Palmer, Jr.] was a disciplinarian, very stern, very strict, and he was about order.  So, as a--you know, as a child, we knew exactly what was expected of us, you know.  My dad was a workaholic.  He worked six days a week and I even have a funny story about that.  I literally, as a child growing up and then once I went to school and, and graduated and started working myself, I thought that a six day work week was what everybody did.  I never even knew that you could work just Monday through Friday because my father worked six days a week the entire time until he retired and never called in sick.  And he literally--you know, if--it didn't matter.  And I think for me personally, that's something that I took from him.  You know, I'm a true workaholic; I love what I do.  But, just having that strong sense of, of work ethic.  I can honestly say that I've gotten that from, from my dad.  I can look at my profession and kind of--can go back to being raised by a disciplinarian and someone who was pretty much always in control of his environment.  I know that I've got that from my father.  Now, my mother [Gussie Palmer] was totally one of the most strongest ladies to this day that I know, you know.  She is just--she had that strong personality that once she put her mind to anything, she was gonna get it done.  And it was one of those where she didn't have to do a lot of talking, but when she spoke, my father just totally listened.  And even I can tell stor- I can think back to when, you know, my dad was a little strict and he would get on us and, you know, we didn't do this, we didn't do that, and my mother would pretty much just stay quiet until she felt like it was too much and it--I mean, literally, I can hear her in the back of my head because she called my father Junior because he was a junior.  And she would say, "Junior, that's enough," and my father would just stop, you know.  And looking back on it, it really showed how powerful she was and that it, it was such a mutual respect.  You know, and my mother was a housewife until probably I was in eleventh grade [at Compton High School, Compton, California], tenth grade, eleventh grade if I can remember back, you know.  So, she was a stay at home mom, which I thought was incredible.  You know, I was--I had the mother who would wake up, comb your hair, make you breakfast, take you to school, you come home, mom would have, you know, a little snack for us before we started our homework.  So, you know, I was raised with that--nowadays, kids would call that, I guess, traditional, very, very traditional family, you know.  So, I think looking back, those are the, the, the things from both my parents that looking at my own personality that I can take from.  I know that--you know, thinking even more about my mother, she was--she had such a strong sense of her family and making sure that we had everything we needed, you know.  And I just--now, thinking back to that, I can look at myself in my own life and with my own family and I have so many of those characteristics to this day.  So, those are things that I really can see that from my upbringing, there's no question I, I got a lot from both sides.
Story_ID: 663434
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, tell us about your siblings.  Now, now you do have an older sister, right, you mentioned who is like three years older than you?
Speaker 2: No--well, no.  I actually have--my older sister, she's fifteen years older than me.  She is a retired nurse.  She worked at Martin Luther King Hospital [Southeast General Hospital; Martin Luther King, Jr. Community Hospital, Willowbrook, California] for thirty-two years, and which see, again, going back to how we were raised, you know, my sister was probably almost ex- close to what my father [James Palmer, Jr.] when she end up retiring as a nurse.  And I have a younger brother [Rod Palmer].  He is a college basketball coach at Cal State, Long Beach university [California State University, Long Beach] right here in Los- Long Beach, California.  And my younger sister, she is a retail manager and she works at Walmart [Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.].  So, those are the--my siblings.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So--now, who all lived in your house when you were growing up besides you and your siblings and your mother [Gussie Palmer] and father?  Any--anybody else live there?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it's funny.  My sister--I was five when my sister got married with--and end up leaving the house.  So, of course, it was really my brother, my younger sister, and then my older sister end up having a son, which is my nephew [Wun Versher] and he pretty much--'cause my sister and her hus- they were working, so my nephew tend--he stayed at our house quite a bit.  So, it was pretty much the, the--I guess I would say the four of us on a consistent basis because my nephew was there so--
Speaker 1: He was about the same age as you and your--
Speaker 2: My nephew is four years--let's see, my brother is three years younger than myself, my sister is three years younger than my brother, and my nephew is two years younger than, than him as well. So--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --we were all pretty close in age (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  Okay.  All right (background noise).
Story_ID: 663435
Speaker 1: Now, do you have an, an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Wow.  My early childhood memories--wow.  You know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) An earliest.
Speaker 2: Earliest.  What I can remember as a child, we--it was so funny and I can think back now.  As a kid, I pretty much thought I had everything in the world, you know.  We didn't want for anything.  We did any and everything we wanted to do as kids, very active in sports, grew up as a neighborhood kid, playing outside with, with our friends and my brother [Rod Palmer] because my brother and I were so, so close.  I probably was considered a tomboy, which my mother [Gussie Palmer] tried her best to, to change that, I guess eventually--of course, eventually she found out that it just didn't work and she just decided to let me--let me go.  But, I grew up as a neighborhood kid, hanging out, you know, with the neighborhood and outside and just pretty much doing all act- because, you know, at that--at--during the time where I grew up, we did all our activities outside.  We didn't stay in the house [in Compton, California].  There was no computers and Internet and all that, but pretty much a neighborhood kid.
Story_ID: 663436
Speaker 1: Now, now you lived in--you were born in Los Angeles [California], but you, you, you were raised in Compton [California], right?  And--
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: What was the neighborhood like when you, you came along?
Speaker 2: You know, from what I can remember, as--I didn't even know--I just go back and listen to stories about my neighborhood that, you know, it was a little rough.  But, it's interesting because of the way that I was raised, I, I pretty much--we--all my friends used to say that we had the white house with the white picket fence around it because I literally did not even know that, that my neighborhood was tough because we just--I just never experienced those things.  But, you know, growing up in Compton, you know, you used to hear the stories and maybe now--I mean, I guess once I grew up, I realized that it was a little tough but I can honestly say my block, I never ever felt that it was by any means, you know, and that's why we were kids who were able to play in the street and not have any problems, any issues.  It was kind of interesting because once I grew up a little bit and maybe got in high--started getting in middle school [Benjamin O. Davis Junior High School; Benjamin O. Davis Middle School, Compton, California] and high school [Compton High School, Compton, California], you start to notice the drugs coming into the--to the neighborhood and notice how there were several of the, the older kids, how you can tell that the drugs were affecting them.  And we still kind of knew it, but it still never affected my, my surroundings at all.  I think the only thing that we--I experienced as a kid where I knew that we--that maybe there was a little danger, we had--our house got broken into twice and I think that was kind of an eye opener to let us know that, you know, wow, we are living kind of in a--in a neighborhood where things like that could possibly happen.  But, of course, my dad [James Palmer, Jr.], you know, we end up putting an alarm in our house and, you know, not even having any problems after that, but still experiencing someone coming in and violating your home, you know, as a child was a little devastating, you know.  So--and I had two--I have actually two really good stories about my parents when our house got broken into, which I think is incredible.
Speaker 1: Oh, tell it.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I have one--I remember my--we were a church going family, you know, as a child.  I grew up in a--in a Baptist church, in a Baptist home--
Speaker 1: What was the name of your church?
Speaker 2: Well, we had two.  One--the first one was Ajalon Temple of Truth Baptist Church [Los Angeles, California] and the second church we became members were Second Mount Carmel Missionary Baptist Church [Los Angeles, California].  My brother [Rod Palmer] and I, we were about--I think I was probably fifteen and my brother at the time was twelve or thirteen, one of the two, and we had went to church, had dinner 'cause we would always have Sunday dinner and it was time to go back to church, and my brother and I didn't want to go.  We wanted to stay home because, again, you know, the neighborhood kids, we wanted to play and we just didn't feel like going back to evening service that, that Sunday.  And my mom [Gussie Palmer] and dad said fine.  So, my brother and I get a chance to stay home.
Story_ID: 663437
Speaker 1: Well, my brother [Rod Palmer] and I are at home, I'm in the house, my brother is outside, and there was a--two kids who were actually--two of our friends actually got into a, a scuffle.  And so my brother is yelling, "Violet [HistoryMaker Violet Palmer], Violet, you gotta get out here, you gotta get out here.  They're fighting.  They're fighting."  So, of course, for me, I just run out the side door to go, you know, see who's fighting, two of our--you know, two, two neighborhood friends are fighting.  That's like the big thing to go watch.  Needless to say, I was probably outside maybe fifteen, twenty minutes, maybe.  It was--it--and it could've been longer than that, but that's what it felt like.  When I got back into the house, we always had a television in our kitchen, always.  It was just what we were--you know, it's funny, black family always have a, a television in the kitchen.  When I got back into the house, the television was gone.  I called my brother and I said, "Oh, my god.  We are in trouble," because I knew that someone had came into the house and stole the television.  So, of course, my brother and I, we're panicking, we're, we're crying, "Oh, my god, mom [Gussie Palmer], dad's gonna kill us, mom's gonna kill us, we're in trouble," you know.  Sure enough, parents come home, told my dad exactly what happened and which is the craziest thing because he, he didn't yell 'cause, you know, we were just expecting to, to get yelled at and get a whooping or we thought we were gonna be on punishment.  We knew that something was gonna happen.  My dad just literally, he goes to the back of the house, didn't even know it, went to the back of the house, had his suit on, had his--got his little pistol, put it in his pocket, went through the back door, out our gate, and went down the street.  And at this point in time, my--we were sitting in the--in the kitchen getting chastised by my mom, like, "You guys know--," you know, the whole, "you know better, you know you have to lock the door when you leave," da, da, da.  Literally about five minutes later, my father went--walked down the street, walked into--this is--he tells us later what he did and he said, "Don't ever, ever do this, ever because this was probably one of the worst things that I've could've--that I could've done because someone really could've got hurt or I could've--or, or I could've got hurt."  Went down, pretty much knew who had taken the television.  Because, you know, in a--on a neighborhood or on a street where you kind of know everybody--so my, my dad and his gut instincts had a good feeling who had came into his home.  So, sure enough, my dad walks back in about five minutes later, he has the TV in his hand and sets it on the--on the kitchen table.  And we said, "Dad, what, what are you--where did you get the TV from?"  He said, "Down there at Smurf [ph.] house."  So, literally, my dad walked down the street, knocked on the door, they said come in 'cause they all knew who--knew him.  He went in the door--he said he walked into the--to the house, his TV was sitting on the table.  He--he's in the--he said, well--he said, "Mr. Palmer [James Palmer, Jr.], what can we do for you?"  He said, "I just came for my television."  They--every--he says everybody just stopped, he picked up his television, he walked out and walked back home.  And literally, no one ever, ever, ever came back in our house again.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I've heard similar stories in Chicago [Illinois] in neighborhood where people know each other.  It's--yeah.
Speaker 1: And he--it--you know, I think the, the amazing thing was, when he came back in, my brother and I, our eyes were just this big 'cause we were like--you know, I knew my dad was Superman.  You know how you feel like your, your parents could just--they, they--nothing can hurt them, and I went, my father is definitely Superman.  He--
Speaker 2: Was your father a large man?
Speaker 1: He was 6', 6'3", 6'3" and a half, you know, about 200 pounds, one--195, 200.  So, just tall, but not--I mean, I, I guess he considered--I guess that, that still would be--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --considered a, a, a big, tall man.  But, I just thought it was incredible, I mean, probably one of the most incredible things I had ever seen my father do, which, of course, he always would--he, he, he would--he could do everything, but as a child, I just thought, this, this man will protect us from anything.
Story_ID: 663438
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, the story--actually, and I have one before that.  This was about my mom [Gussie Palmer], which is kind of nice.  I have one about my dad [James Palmer, Jr.] and one about my mom.  My mom had woke up, got us all ready for school, dropped us off, came back home, and normally she says she was at home doing her normal things.  She says she was in the--in the kitchen doing dishes, you know, doing her, her normal dut- cleaning up the kitchen 'cause she had just dropped us off at school she said, and she heard the glass break in our--in the--in the back bedroom.  So, she kind of tiptoed and she could hear some, some guys talking.  Of course, she goes back to the front of the house and she turns the alarm on.  So, of course--and we had the alarm--the old school alarms where they would put the pads underneath the carpet so as soon as they broke the glass and they stepped down on the floor, the alarm would go off.  So, my mother literally let them come in.  She said the alarm--once they--after breaking the glass--the sliding glass door and they stepped on the--on the carpet, the alarm went off.  She runs to the closet, gets my dad's gun again and chased them through the back--they, they ran--they just--both of them--she said they took off running.  She said literally, she could have shot both those kids in the back.  They were trying to jump over the back fence 'cause for our back fence, we had an alley that separated the, the homes on the back side.  So, my mother said, literally, she told them to freeze.  I said, mom--we, we, we--it was like a big joke to us.  We go, "Mom, really?  You said freeze?"  She says, "I just wanted them to stop, but they wouldn't."  She said and something told her not to shoot and so she didn't.  She says--but she--and when--it's so funny, when, when we got home from school and she told the story, we were--we (laughter) we thought--we called her policewoman for months after that.  But, she says something in her heart just told her--she says and they were pretty young--you know, she said probably sixteen, eighteen, you know, just young--two young men, and that--something just told her not to shoot them.
Speaker 2: It's interesting, but both stories speak to the civility of a black community, really.
Story_ID: 663439
Speaker 1: All right.  Yeah, we were just talking about relationships in the neighborhood and what that--what those relationships mean, you know.  Now, Compton [California], today as we sit here in 2016, I think it was maybe the, the advent of the rap era that made Compton like a, a prototypical, you know, ghetto type--you know, I mean, when you--people hear the name--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --I mean, there's the movie, 'Straight Outta Compton'--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you know, that talks about these guys kind of straight out of the hood and become successful, you know, as rappers and that sort of thing and where--and a lot of the, the rap culture in those days, you know, glorified street violence and crime and stuff like that all in the--I mean, not, not all of it did by, you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --there's, there's that, that, that element to it, the gangster life and all that.  Even a song, in the City of Compton ['California Love'] you know is a--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --is a--has a--was actually written by a guy from Dayton [Ohio] (laughter), Roger [Roger Troutman], you know.  But, it's--you know, so anyway.  So, Compton was not--did not have a huge drug problem, when you were growing up anyway.
Speaker 2: No, we did not.  You know, it was--I started to experience just a--just a small bit probably I would say when I was in high school [Compton High School, Compton, California].  You know, you would have a couple of, of the, the neighborhood kids that had older siblings and at that point, we would call it--I guess it was sherm that was probably the popular drug, which, for me didn't--still didn't even know what it was.
Speaker 1: Sherm, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was sherm.
Speaker 1: I've never heard of that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that, that was like the big drug.  And I--and, and, again, that's what you would hear--kids would talk about.
Speaker 1: So this, this would've been in the late '70s [1970s], early '80s [1980s]?
Speaker 2: Early '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And just experienced it where, you know--and for some reason, apparently this drug made you hot.  So, we had a couple of instances where, you know, the, the neighbor that lived two doors down came out of the house and was--kept walking up and down the street, taking off her clothes, you know, and I could hear my mother [Gussie Palmer] say, "That, that girl is--you know, she just on that stuff."  'Cause that's what my, my, my mom would always say.  So we--you know, again, seeing it, but it was one of those where it, it only happened a couple of times for me, you know.  And I was--I was very, very fortunate because living on a--on a close knit street where everyone knew, knew everyone.  Everyone, you know, you knew all the parents.  So, for me, it was just a typical black neighborhood.  So, you, you, you experienced just a couple of things.  I think if we would hear gunshots, they were a couple of blocks over.  You know, we didn't--there was nothing directly on my street that I had to deal with.  You know, you would always hear, oh, you know--you know, a couple of blocks away, somebody got shot or something like that.  But, nothing never actually happened on my block and I think that was--you know, I don't know if it was just--I was fortunate.  I probably--and looking back on it, I'm pretty sure it was.  But, I think it had a lot to do with--you know, there were a lot of families.  We all--you know, and, and it was--all of us were kind of the same age.  We grew up together.  We played our sports together.  We--you know, we were all neighborhood kids.  We were able to walk to our neighborhood pool, go swimming, you know, all summer.  So, we were able to play baseball in the street.  You know, we made--you know, we were the--we were the neighborhood that you would make anything--we would use anything.  You know, the light pole was first base, the--you know, in the street, the, the sewer--
Speaker 1: Yeah, the sewer lid.
Speaker 2: --frame, that would be second base, you know, and then third base would be the curb.  You know, it--so, we used just the street, you know.  And the--I, I think probably the only thing we experienced where we had a couple of older neighbors that we would hit our ball in the--in the yard and they would get--they would want to yell at us because we--they would lock their gate and we would jump the fence to get our ball back and try to jump back over the fence before they even knew, you know.  And so I think that was probably the, the only thing that we would deal with, with our, with our--a couple of our old neighbors.  So, just living in, in a community where, you know, knowing that there were things going on down the street, down--around the corner on the other block or something like that, we just--I never really had to experience it on my block, which I think was a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --which, which was a very, very fortunate thing.
Story_ID: 663440
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell me about school.  Now, what grade school did you start at?  Did, did you go to the same grade school the whole--
Speaker 2: I went to Dickison Elementary School [Clarence A. Dickison Elementary School, Compton, California] for elementary school, I went to Davis Junior High School [Benjamin O. Davis Junior High School; Benjamin O. Davis Middle School, Compton, California], and I went to Compton High School [Compton, California].  It was funny.  In, in elementary school, I was--probably tried to play any and every sport that we could and that, of course, for me transitioned into middle school, you know.  I was the, the, the young girl at--even, you know, playing Little League with the boys because, of course, in elementary, there was--the, the sports (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Girls didn't have teams.
Speaker 2: --yeah.  It--there was no separation because there--you know, you, you either had to play with the boys or you couldn't play.  So, you know, for me--
Speaker 1: This is all before the--was it Title IX?
Speaker 2: Title IX.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: All before Title IX.  So, I played Little League baseball, you know.  And my mother [Gussie Palmer]--you know, it's interesting because my mother really wasn't--had first told me no, she didn't want me to play.  And, you know, I just went to my dad [James Palmer, Jr.] and I said, "Dad, would you please talk to her?  You know, it's gonna be fine, I really wanna play," my brother [Rod Palmer] was playing and, you know, my mom and dad had a talk--had a conversation about it and eventually, my mom broke down and said, "Sure, you know, go play."  So, I'd been the only girl on the Little League team.  It was the Indians; I'll never forget.  So, I was able to do that.  And then once I got to middle school, is when, of course, you had the separation in the sports.  They were separate.  You know, girls played their--on their sport teams and the boys played on their sport teams.  So, of course, then, I was able to play basketball, tried a little bit of volleyball, ran a little track.
Speaker 1: Now, now--in terms of basketball, now, now I--and you would--you would really make a mark as a basketball player in college [California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, Pomona, California].  The--and in high school, too, I guess.  But, in those days, were they playing--were girls allowed to play regular basketball because I know when (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --I came out of high school a million years ago in 1967, and my sister played high school basketball, but she--they had to play something called captain basketball where you--
Speaker 2: Right, where they could only play on the half court.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, on the half court and--
Speaker 2: Right.  No, my mother actually experienced that when she played--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --as--you know, growing up.  I never had to experience that.  We played full court just like the boys.  So, from the--from the time I started, that was how I played.
Story_ID: 663441
Speaker 1: What's interesting is that played basketball, played softball as well, and I really believe that I was a better softball player--I played short stop--than I was basketball, but I had the love of basketball.  It was just my favorite sport, so that was the sport that I just kind of gravitated to and stuck with.  Became very, very good in high school, ended up being an All-American, captain, cap- captain of my team, MVP of the league, you know, so I was very, very successful with basketball.
Speaker 2: Now, what did that mean around here?  I mean, in, in Compton [California]?  I mean--'cause we know--I mean, I know when I was growing up, I would check the newspaper, you know, to see--'cause we had a pretty strong high school league to see who, who was the high point person in basketball, who was going to be all-state and all that.  It was a big deal, you know, and the track meets would come, we'd check all, all the brothers.  But, the women's sports weren't covered hardly, so even if--they, they weren't playing, you know, team basketball when I was coming along, but, but when you were coming along, did, did the women's sports or the girls sports get very much attention?  I mean, what did it mean to be the MVP?  I mean, did it really mean anything to anybody?  Did the people really pay attention to it?
Speaker 1: Well, you know what?  It's funny.  You--it--we were--we were still not getting the recognition like, like girls get today because, you know, Title IX had just started, so you, you were pretty much getting recognition and I can honestly say, my, my, my high school coach, Caroline Montgomery [ph.], she was very instrumental in really putting things out there, like calling schools or, or calling coaches to come look because you, you were not getting--I mean, which you--of course, yes, I had a--you know, maybe a couple of, of newspaper clippings or things that, that, of course, took notice of those accomplishments, but it was more so you still had to have a coach that was pushing for you to get those acknowledgements.  And, you know, one thing I can say is my high school coach, she did a really, really good job of that.  And I think that was probably the most instru- instrumental thing in helping me get a basketball scholarship because at that point in time at--you know, women just didn't--there was not like a lot of scholarships available.  It had just kind of started when, when, when I graduated from, from high school.  And being as talented as I was, allowing coaches to come watch and her putting--you know, making those phone calls and writing letters to different colleges, having those college coaches come watch really helped me get that recognition and--
Speaker 2: 'Cause, 'cause I'm thinking it might be like--even like analogous to somebody with a National Merit Scholarship [National Merit Scholarship Program] at Compton High School [Compton, California].  I mean, it's something that's big but most people don't (laughter) think about it.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: You know, it's--
Speaker 1: They don't.
Speaker 2: It's--yeah.
Speaker 1: It's--I mean, but of course during that time, that was huge because I even think back--I think back now and my dad [James Palmer, Jr.]--you know, we talked about it years later after I end up going to school [California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, Pomona, California] and graduating and, and everything, you know, my dad said, "Wow, I'm so happy," 'cause, 'cause I end up getting a scholarship to college and my brother [Rod Palmer] end up getting a scholarship to college.  And, you know, my dad said, "I really had no idea how I was gonna pay for my kids to go to school.  You know, I would've maybe had to take--," you know, knock on wood, my dad never had to take a loan out on his house, you know.  So, at that point in time, he said, "I possibly would have had to take a loan out on my house and maybe send my, my kids to school," you know, not--of course, not knowing how much it would cost but I think the, the, the positive to it was that he didn't because we actually got basketball scholarships.  He was able to help my brother and I--we both ended up getting some car--getting cars to be able to get back and forth to school--I mean, you know back and forth.  We both lived at school, but being able to drive back home, you know, to come see my parents, and I think that was probably one of the most fortunate things that we were able to do to help our parents--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --because not knowing if they would be able to pay for school.
Story_ID: 663442
Speaker 1: Now I want to go back a little bit to as you were growing up.  Did you have any sports idols?  Who were your idols growing up in terms of sports?
Speaker 2: You know, I--looking back, I can honestly say that one--in women's basketball, for me, I would honestly say it had to be my mother [Gussie Palmer] because there was not a woman other than her that I really kind of looked up to during--when I was young growing up.  You know, and I used to listen to, you know, my mother and father [James Palmer, Jr.] talk about when they--their childhood and, and playing, and my mother talked about, you know, how they could only play with the half court and, you know.  So, so, for me personally, I can honestly say that it was my mother that I would--that I looked up to at that point in time.  Now, once I got in high school [Compton High School, Compton, California], is then I, I started kind of hearing about, you know, like Ann Meyers, which, of course, she went to UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], Anita Ortega, which is another good friend of mine, went to UCLA.  So, those were, for me, women after I got into high school where I thought, wow, you know, I, I definitely would love to be like them because I just admired them as, as women's basketball players.  So, I can honestly say that it was my mom to start and then the other--the--and Ann Meyers and Anita Ortega later, growing up.
Story_ID: 663443
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, in terms of basketball, you played point guard, right, on the, on the team?
Speaker 2: I was a point guard at Cal Poly--Cal Poly Pomona [California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, Pomona, California] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And you're playing regular--in, in women's basketball, they played with a slightly smaller ball, right?  Or, or did you?
Speaker 2: At the time when I--with, with me, no.  We played with the regular size.  The smaller ball didn't come until later and I want to say, oh, I don't even remember when--I wanna say maybe junior or senior year or--I, I can't--I'm--and maybe, maybe it was my freshman year in college when the ball--when they brought in that--the smaller ball.  But, for all my years growing up, we played with the regular size ball, you know.
Speaker 1: How did you feel about having a smaller ball?
Speaker 2: It really didn't make a difference.  You, you know--not that it gave me any more an advantage because, again, if--you know, for us, we played with whatever was given to us, so it really wasn't a big deal at all to be honest, so never really played a big factor.  I think, for me, just learning--once--to me, playing with the big ball really kind of made it easier because the--once they made the ball a little smaller, it was a little lighter which, of course, for being a point guard, I had a little better handles, you know, with dribbling, you know, that type of thing or shooting it.  So, it didn't really play a big factor for me personally.
Speaker 1: So, how did you learn to play your position and, and did you model it after any players that were ahead of you?
Speaker 2: You know, it's--I--pretty much, it was--I really learned--you know, my dad [James Palmer, Jr.] was one where, again, going back to saying that we were fortunate.  We had a--my dad put the basketball court in the backyard and we had it sitting on top of the garage and we, we grew up--in our backyard, we had a, a lot of concrete.  My dad, you know--pretty much, we had like a make believe court in the backyard.  So--
Speaker 1: This was a paved or black- blacktop (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Pave--it was--it was just paved concrete, you know--you know, how--and so, had that--it was--it was that neighborhood house that all the kids could come play.  So, pretty much our whole neighborhood hung out in our backyard once my brother [Rod Palmer] and I start playing, you know, playing basketball, got to that age where we would play.  So, for me, I was in the backyard with my brother even before high school [Compton High School, Compton, California] playing.  My dad would, you know, on the weekends come play, you know.  So, I can honestly say, my skills came from the two of them until I got into high school.  And then once I got into high school, I was fortunate enough because my high school coach [Caroline Montgomery (ph.)] would literally come to my house Saturday--every Saturday morning.  We would do a workout, you know.  So, I, I think I, I just got a lot of my extra practice time with my high school coach during those high school years.  She just took the time and I think she knew that I had, you know, a special talent and she took that special time with me to work on my game and, and, of course, with her doing that, it really helped me I think--I can honestly say that I know it helped me achieving my goals and being able to get a basketball scholarship.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, the point guard on the basketball team, some people watching this won't know this, that's why I'm--I have to say it (laughter).  The point guard on the basketball team is the brains of the team, right?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: That--it's been--you know, that's the person that brings the ball up, you know, starts the plays if they have plays, you know, is--probably passes the ball to those who make the--make most of the shots, you know.  Ideally, the point guard is doing that.  Sometimes, it's somebody else, but it's usually the point, point guard that starts it up.  So, in--it--the point guard is probably the most skilled player on the team.  So, so, this is what your coach saw in you, I guess.
Speaker 2: I would definitely agree.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know, there's no doubt about it.  Point guards are leaders, they have to control--you know, they're, they're actually the coach on the floor.  And if--and, and which you can--we already know in looking back in--on history or looking--going forward that most successful teams have that point guard because you're actually that leader and you control that team on the floor.  And looking back, as you said, that I can really--I can honestly say that I think my coach really did see those skills in me, being a leader and, and being able to be that coach on the floor and having, having, having the ability to make my team better because I think also, that's what a point guard does as well.
Story_ID: 663444
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell us a little about your team, your Compton High School [Compton, California] team.  Did, did you have a good team?
Speaker 2: We were very successful, we were.  We actually end up three out of my--no, two out of my three--no, I take that back.  All three years, we actually won Moore League championship.  We--actually I think two years in a row, we lost semifinals before we actually made it--we, we could've made it to the CIF [California Interscholastic Federation] finals and I think that was probably one of our--two of our biggest disappointments.
Speaker 1: So this is the California--
Speaker 2: This is the California (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) state tournament?
Speaker 2: --state tournament, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was funny, what--my junior year was the year we played against Riverside Poly [Riverside Polytechnic High School, Riverside, California], which was Cheryl Miller's team, and Cheryl Miller, of course, is another big time USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California] graduate, you know, hall of famer.
Speaker 1: The, the sister of Reggie Miller.
Speaker 2: The sister of Reggie Miller.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Correct.  And they beat us in the semifinals, which was probably one of the most disappointing games in my, of course, high school career because we were really--we were a better team; we just got outplayed, you know.
Speaker 1: I, I should correct myself.  Reggie Miller was Cheryl Miller's brother.
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: As great as he was, Cheryl Miller was a revolutionary basketball player in--
Speaker 2: Icon (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) women's basketball.
Speaker 2: Especially in women's basketball.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, 100 percent correct.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And Reggie Miller is no slouch, but she was--he says that she used to beat him all the time (laughter)--
Speaker 2: She--exactly.
Speaker 1: --when they were growing up.
Speaker 2: Without a doubt.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, at any rate--well, that's--okay.  So, if you're gonna have to lose to somebody (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well--yeah, we would always say, well, if I--I can actually tell the story.  If I'm gonna lose to anybody, I lost to one of the best in the game today, you know, in high school.  So--but, again, we were Moore League champs all three years and I was even fortunate enough myself to be Moore League MVP my senior year, which was a great accomplishment.  I was an All-American my senior year.  So, you know, personally, I had a very, very successful career as a basketball player in high school, which I think that's what really helped me attain my college scholarship to Cal Poly Pomona [California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, Pomona, California].
Speaker 1: All right.  How many points did you average?  I mean, what, what were your stats in high school?
Speaker 2: My stats in high school?  I was pretty good.  I pretty much averaged probably about eighteen points a game, five rebounds.  I think the--one of my biggest assets was I would--I--at that time, I was averaging like five assists a game.  So, I was a pretty all around good basketball player during high school.
Story_ID: 663445
Speaker 1: Now, what else were you interested in in high school [Compton High School, Compton, California]?
Speaker 2: It's funny.  In high school, I--of course, being raised in a church going family, you know, I played the piano.  So, of course, during elementary [Clarence A. Dickison Elementary School, Compton, California], middle school [Benjamin O. Davis Junior High School; Benjamin O. Davis Middle School, Compton, California], I took piano lessons, so I, I was--I was an avid--I loved it, played for our Sunday school at church.  And it's funny, I, I actually played for the Sunday school until my junior year because I was so--I just--after my junior year, I got so heavily involved in basketball that I told my mom and dad [Gussie Palmer and James Palmer, Jr.] I just really didn't have the time to, you know, practice anymore for, for Sunday school, and, you know, my dad was a little disappointed to start, but he understood, and, and, you know, said, okay, you know.  'Cause I just really felt like I knew that I, I, I wanted to get a scholarship.  I think at that point in time in, in the back of my own head, I just knew that I had a chance and that was--you know, I just--basketball kind of became everything.  So, of course, for me, I stopped--I didn't necessarily stop playing the piano, I just, you know, wasn't able to fulfill my obligations as the way that I felt like I should and my parents actually gave me that support and, and allowed me to do it.  But, even to this day, I, I say, you know, to myself that I'm gonna go back and take piano lessons, but, of course, my life stays so busy that I still haven't had time to do it.  But, again, I think soon enough, I think I am gonna do it, go back to playing the piano.
Story_ID: 663446
Speaker 1: Did you have favorite teachers in--
Speaker 2: I did.  Ms. Brown [ph.] was one of my favorite teachers.  It's funny, I had two Browns.  Ms. Brown and Mr. Brown, were two of my favorite teachers.  My third favorite teacher was Ms. Foster [ph.].  And, and they were--it's funny.  They were all in middle school [Benjamin O. Davis Junior High School; Benjamin O. Davis Middle School, Compton, California].  And it's interesting.  Even today, I think middle school is probably that, that era for young kids where you either know you're gonna make it or, or you just have those teachers in your lives that become that role model, that, that can--that can help you get to where you want to go.  And can I honestly say, Mr. Brown was my counselor and he reminded me of my father [James Palmer, Jr.] for some reason.  You know, I just--he was very--just, just, just a, a big, tall man, stern, strict, but was always understanding, you know.  And Ms. Foster, it's so funny.  She was my science teacher.  And for some reason, I just really loved her personality.  She was always so easy to talk to.  She, again, was a big sports fan, so would always--you know, she was always attending our basketball games in which, of course, in school, you have a lot of teachers that, you know, would always attend all the sporting events.  But, I think for me, that just really--I looked at that and, and it just--it was like a positive for me.  So--and then Ms. Brown was my assistant principal.  And I don't know--for some reason, I just really took to her.  And I think every year, we would have--you know how you, you have that time of the year where you can choose who you would--who you would like to be where a student could now be who, who--you know, during school year, you could flip flop, and I always wanted to be the assistant principal.  And I--and, again, looking back on it, I always wanted to lead or, or be in that important position.  And looking at my life now, well, hasn't really changed much, not knowing that as a child.  So, those were the three that I can honestly say that during school just really I looked up to.
Speaker 1: Now, were you involved in any clubs or anything in school?
Speaker 2: I was ASB [associated student body].  I was always on the ASB council, vice president.  That was probably--other than sports, that, for me, was probably something that I really, really loved, being involved in school activities.  Did a little bit of--I sung in a choir a little bit, not a--not a whole lot, just a little bit 'cause, again, I think that's where the piano, the music background came in.  But, so heavily in- involved in all the sports, which took up most of my time during school.  So, that was--that pretty much was what--where my focus was.
Story_ID: 663447
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, back to sports on a level.  Now, I'm gonna ask you a question that is based on just casual observation but not a study or anything.  But, a lot of males that watch women play basketball notice that when girls or women play basketball, they--it--they play at, at a, a higher team oriented level (laughter).  They know the rules better.
Speaker 2: True.
Speaker 1: They seem to pass the ball more.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: And it's--it looks like a precision game, you know.  When you see males play, especially very talented males, the rules go out the window (laughter).
Speaker 2: They do.
Speaker 1: And they just do stuff, you know.
Speaker 2: That is very true.
Speaker 1: I mean, is that--is that something that you would say is--
Speaker 2: I would definitely agree.  I think--the--women--in the women's game, because we are not as, as athletic and as big, that we tend to--we're just more fundamentally sound, play more as a team versus men, because they're so athletic and strong, that they tend to just focus on their individual ability.  And, and I think that's the biggest difference between the two games, is that if you watch a women's game, they pass the ball, they run their plays, they're very fundamentally sound.  I think overall, women tend to sometimes just, just even shoot a little better versus men, because they're able to dunk, tend to just want to, just want to showboat and do those type of things versus on the women's game, we're just a little more fundamental.  We, we have to focus on fundamentals because we just--you know, there, there--the, the bask- we just don't have those abilities to jump up and dunk the ball like they can.  So, for us, it's more about team basketball.  It's more about the fundamentals.  It's more about running your plays.  It's more about their precision of getting--of, of being in the right place, running the plays to score baskets versus men, they just really kind of dominate it with their athletic ability.
Speaker 1: You know, I hear what you're saying, but I wonder if it's not even more than that because women are playing each other who have comparable athletic, you know, skills, and, you know, I mean, at least within that context, speed and explosiveness about the same, you know--I mean, it balances out on the team.  But, it seems like women are just more fundamental (laughter).
Speaker 2: I would agree.  We're, we're--women are a lot more fundamentally sound--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --in the way that we just play the game.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: I would agree with you.
Speaker 1: --it may have to do with mentality more and I can't--you know, it's--testosterone makes a difference I think in all this, you know, the way men think about it--about it.
Speaker 2: Well, I think it--
Speaker 1: They, they just don't have the same fundamentals.  They don't (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They just don't.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I would agree.
Story_ID: 663448
Speaker 1: Okay, so how did you choose a college?
Speaker 2: I chose college--it's an interesting story.  I, I had this one coach, the late Darlene May, and when I was a sophomore, she literally walked into the gym and she was looking at two of my older teammates.  They were juniors at the time.  She wasn't even coming to look, look at me because I--of course, at that time, I was too young, and the way she came into the gym, something about this lady, I just really admired, you know.  It was just her presence and it was so funny 'cause she came over and spoke, you know, and introduced herself and for years, I just--as a--as a freshman and a sophomore, I just kind of watched her and she wasn't even recruiting me.  But, I remember her coming up to me and saying, she says, "You know what, [HistoryMaker] Violet Palmer?"  She said, "You keep doing what you're doing, then one day, I think I'm gonna come and I'll be--I'll be coming back to see you."  And for some reason, I don't--I have no idea why, it just stuck with me, you know.  And then, of course, you know, going through my sophomore year, my junior year, and now my senior year, I, I was now, you know, trying to figure out where I wanted to go and as soon as Darlene May came into the gym and I knew that she wanted me to play for her, there was no question about it.  And I can--and, and I can take it back to that sophomore year when I first met her.  I just felt like she was honest.  I felt like I would just be treated fairly.  I think the other thing for me was that--'cause Cal Poly [California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, Pomona, California] was a Division II school and--
Speaker 1: Now, that means--
Speaker 2: Well, the only--it just means that it wasn't a big time Division I school.  It's just a, a--
Speaker 1: Based--do a population of the school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, do a population of the school, correct.  But, were still giving scholarships.  So, for me, it really didn't matter about the population of school and, you know, I, I think the also thing that really was a--was a big push for me was that it was still close, but far enough away from home that my parents [Gussie Palmer and James Palmer, Jr.] could still--you know, because of course I grew--growing up, that my parents didn't miss a game and it didn't matter what sport it was, for myself or my brother [Rod Palmer].  They--
Speaker 1: So, where is Cal Poly in relationship to Compton [California]?
Speaker 2: It's like--it's actually inland, about forty-five minutes from Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, it's very, very--I mean, really extremely close.
Speaker 1: So, east of Los Angeles (unclear).
Speaker 2: East of Los Angeles, yes.  So, I think that was another push from me, that I was able to--I didn't want to go out of state real far.  I didn't want to go to the East Coast, never really wanted to deal with cold weather.  But, I really for some reason took to this coach.  I just loved her demeanor.  I loved just the way that she came across.  Just--she just seemed extremely honest and I felt like from watching her team that I would really fit her program.  I felt like, you know, that the, the players that she recruited, I could--I would do well on, on her--on her team.  So, I, I think it was just more so just--she made me feel very, very comfortable and I, I just--from just watching her through my high school years, she just seemed extremely fair, you know, and I didn't think--I thought that I would just get a fair shake.  And I think for any kid planning or trying at that point making a decision to go to a school to play, that's really all you want.  You just wanna know that you just get a fair--a fair shot with your talent and see where it takes you.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now did Cal Poly play a similar style of basketball as Compton High School [Compton, California]?
Speaker 2: A little bit.  You know, I didn't--I can honestly tell you that I--that really didn't play a huge part.  It was really more so being so comfortable with her and I'll never forget when she--when she literally came into my home and sat there with my mom and dad, I just had a sense of ease, a sense of, of--that I knew that what she was saying, I felt like it was the truth, like she wasn't kind of giving me B.S. just to get me to come to her school.  And that was really honestly--I just took to her personality and, and the way that she carried herself--
Speaker 1: This is--
Speaker 2: --to be honest with you.
Speaker 1: This is 19--
Speaker 2: Eighty-two [1982].
Speaker 1: --eighty-two [1982], okay, 1982.  This is before there's a WNBA [Women's National Basketball Association], I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was before WNBA.
Speaker 1: And--all right.  And so, this is--okay.
Story_ID: 663449
Speaker 1: So--and, and your major is going to be--
Speaker 2: I graduated with recreation--a B--I have a B.S. in recreation administration.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Okay.  So, did you--was that your major from the start?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, initially, it was gonna be physical education.  I was thinking, of course, I was gonna try to do like my--all my aunts and uncles and be a school teacher and for some reason, I just didn't think I wanted to be confined to a classroom.  And I think the--and--but I still wanted to have something to do with sports and the outdoors and recreation was that way of, of me being able to, to be outdoors.  I think being a--growing up as a park kid myself, you know.  I was a neighborhood kid who, who was always going to the parks, to the--to swimming and playing Little League, that I thought that was just something that I gravitated to.  And it was interesting.  I, I--'cause initially I just thought that I would have to be a teacher to kind of stay close to the sports and activities with children.  And then once I figured out--or once I got to college and knew that I could become a recreation major, I went, wow, this is it.  So, that was really how I gravi- gravitated to being--to going into getting into recreation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now, now, the basketball team, you know, won a--she [Palmer's college coach, Darlene May], she had a--really a high percentage of winning--I mean, you know, she won way more than she--five to one, I guess, you know.  You know, she was--I mean, the team, Cal Poly [California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, Pomona, California], won a lot of games when you were--
Speaker 2: We were extremely good.  I can honestly say I went to the Final Four--I was at Cal Poly four years, we were at the Final Four three out of my four years.  We were back to back national champions.  We were CCAA [California Collegiate Athletic Association] champs all four seasons.  I played on a very talented Division II basketball team, one of the best in the country my, my entire four years.  So, again, I was very, very fortunate to be a part of those teams, extremely successful, hardworking.  Probably I could--I--you know, looking back on it, probably one of the best decisions I made as far as making a decision to, to go to school, not only making a decision or being grateful to receive the scholarship, but being on a--being a part of a team that was just extremely good.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the other members of the team?
Speaker 2: I played with Vickie Davis [Vickie Mitchell], oh, Kelly Graves [ph.], Jeannette Tjaarda, I played--Michelle McCoy, Debbie Larsen [Debra Larsen], and literally, all of those players were Division II All-Americans.  They were outstanding basketball players and just great people, though.  I think more so, for me, that was something that, that I looked at.  They were just--I mean, even to this day, just great people.
Story_ID: 663450
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, your, your coach, Coach May [Darlene May], was also the first woman to referee for the Olympics, right?  For the--
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: So, she refereed basketball in the 1984 Women's Olympics [1984 Summer Olympics, Los Angeles, California], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I mean, in the Olympic Games in women's basketball.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I can honestly say Coach had a lot to do with me becoming a, a basketball referee.  You know, I--playing for her, we all knew that she was a coach, but, you know, while--during my playing days, she was still refereeing and that was something that we talked about, you know, during my years.  And, and for me being a recreation major [at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, Pomona, California], I actually took officiating as a course for, for--during school and then I was a part of intramurals, you know.  I refereed intramurals as a part-time job during school.  I actually--I was--I took a part-time job and I was a recreation assistant for the City of Placentia [California] and would referee kid, youth league basketball games.  And I think--it's funny.  I think everybody kind of starts off refereeing kids when you kind of get into officiating.  But, I can honestly say, I started because of what she had done and watching her do it.  And, sure enough, once I graduated and made the decision that I really wanted to get involved in officiating, I, I called her and went up and, and had a visit with her and sat in the office and told her that, you know, "I--coach, I'm really thinking about, you know--I joined my like--my local high school association [California Basketball Officials Association, Los Angeles Unit] and I really like it."  And what was so crazy was, she had already knew.  And I don't know how she knew, but she knew that I had already really kind of gotten involved in officiating and told me that, you know, "It's funny.  A little tweety bird had already told me that you pretty much are doing it.  You, you look like me."  So--and I took that as it was a compliment because she was a very strong referee.  She had great court presence.  And once she said that, I mean, it was almost like I just lit up like a Christmas tree and I'm going, oh, wow.  Because, of course, with her, you know, being one of my biggest mentors in officiating, for her to give me that stamp of approval meant the world to me.  So, first starting out, I knew that I was on the right track--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --once I got into officiating.
Story_ID: 663451
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, I'm gonna take you back to--I, I should ask you something about your playing days in college and, and I'm gonna ask you like just a couple questions here that's--probably anybody would think of.  But, what was your--what was your strength as a player?  Did you--I mean, I know--I know you were a point guard, but did you have a--you know, some kind of a shot that was special or a move that you used to--
Speaker 2: You know, for me, I was such an un- I was a really unselfish point guard.  For me, I was a defensive specialist.  It, it didn't matter if on the other team, whoever their best point--whoever their best guard was, Coach May [Darlene May] would have me guard their, their best guard because I was gonna shut them down.  That was--that was my big thing in my years of, of playing at Cal Poly [California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, Pomona, California].  Averaged like five or six assists a game, so I was a good passer, just making everybody better.  I think--sometimes, she used, used to even tell me that I was a little too unselfish because--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I was just--I was--'cause I, I would pretty much pass when she wanted me to shoot, but that just kind of became my style.  It was just the, the type of point guard that I was.  I was more concerned with making my team better versus being un- being selfish to make myself--you know, to score myself.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did you score less than you did in high school [Compton High School, Compton, California]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, during college, I probably averaged about six or seven points a game but still averaged about five or six assists a game and, of course, took, took more pride in being a defensive stopper than anything else.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's--there's something about playing defense that you add by subtracting (laughter).
Speaker 2: This is true.
Speaker 1: You know, the best player on the team can be shut down, you know--
Speaker 2: You've done your job.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So--and are there any game dramas that you can tell us about that, you know, from, from that era?  'Cause you, you all won three championships, right?
Speaker 2: I think--
Speaker 1: Three NCAA II [NCAA Division II] championships in a--not in a row but, you know, three or four years (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think my biggest--the, the biggest thing that I remember was we were playing Delta State [Delta State University, Cleveland, Mississippi], Springfield, Massachusetts, and into the game, I stole the ball.  We were actually--we were up one and playing defense or going back to being the defensive stopper, and I stole the ball, caught it, passed it to my teammate, she scored, and we end up winning the game by three.  And I think for me and my career for college, that was probably one of the biggest moments because literally I felt like--you know, you have that moment in your life where you feel like you won the game for your team, and I think that particular game, I'll never ever forget how I felt stealing--you know, just tap- you know, just trusting my instincts and, and stealing the ball was probably one of the biggest things I think I ever done in my college career--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --as a basketball player.
Speaker 1: All right.  All right.  I would've loved to have been there.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: But, that's a good--that's a good--that's good.  That's what I was trying to get.
Story_ID: 663452
Speaker 1: When your career was--when your college days--now, you, you graduated in '87 [1987], right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Correct.
Speaker 1: And you started working for the City of Los Angeles [California], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay and as a recreation director.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, this is--this typically was like a park with a field house and a--or what?
Speaker 2: Yes.  For the City of Los Angeles, you actually--what they did was, they pretty much gave you a park and I was at Rancho Cienega [Rancho Cienega Sports Complex, Los Angeles, California], my first park.  I actually ended up being at two parks, but my first park was Rancho Cienega and it was one of--it was a large park, which was fortunate for me.  I didn't even know it at the time, but once I kind of learned how the city was structured, that I had--it was a nice gymnasium, I had tennis courts, four baseball diamonds, softball diamonds.  I had the Jackie Robinson track [Jackie Robinson Stadium, Los Angeles, California], which we, we had a, a really, really nice track that a lot of different big track teams would, would use for their training.  So, I was--oh, we had a swimming pool.  So, it was a large park that I was responsible for.  And at that time, not even knowing that I was fortunate to have that opportunity to, to be at a large park, you know, being my first job coming out of, of college [California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, Pomona, California], but that--I was very, very fortunate to have that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So--and you do some officiating there, right?  As, as, as the director?  Did you--
Speaker 2: You know, not really.  I didn't--pretty much as a director, I pretty much just ran all the programs.  I did--I was fortunate enough to have one of--have two of the top basketball leagues for men that I ran.  I actually started a women's flag football league.  So, for me, it was more about programming, programming, Little League, Pop Warner [Pop Warner Little Scholars, Inc.] football, basketball.  And it was--we didn't--it was--we tried to start a women's--a, a youth league for women, but I would actually still have to have my girls actually end up having to play on, on the team with the boys because we could never get enough young ladies to, to actually play, to have a league within their self, but had a, a lot of youth basketball leagues.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, parks are really, you know, are--parks can really be important in neighborhoods, and part of the thing that happens in a lot of urban neighborhoods where there's a lot of violence is that parks are unused or people are afraid to go to a park.  Did you ever encounter that kind of thing when you were in the parks in L.A.?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I can honestly say, I was fortunate because my park unlike several directors being more so in the inner city, my park was on the Westside.  So, I didn't really have to deal with gangs or shootings or anything like that.  It was more so I was in an area where there was just a lot of families that lived there.  So, we had a lot of kid participation, a lot of parent participation because, of course, you know, when you're running youth leagues, Pop Warner football, Little League baseball, and your youth basketball leagues, your parents are your coaches, so I had a really large association with my parents to coach all my teams.  So, for me, I really didn't have to deal with those type of issues because of where my park--where my park was located.
Speaker 1: Now, also, I know people have said the advocates of community policing and other strategies say that if there are activities at a park--I mean, the, the best way to keep crime down is to have a lot of activities.
Speaker 2: No, no doubt about it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Again, if you're--because, again, I think the, the, the negative people, they--if no one is participating in their activity, they don't have any place to go.  So, if, if, if you're in a--in an environment where kids and, and adults are doing things productively and, and having those sporting events and activities, then I don't think the gangs--they don't--they--you know, they're kind of on the--on the--an outcast.  But, I think a lot of it has to do with the area as well because, again, for me, being fortunate to being in an area where there were still a lot of families in those--in, in the areas and still to this day.  You know, when I go back and, and visit my parks, it's the same way.  The parks really haven't changed at all.  They're, they're pretty much the same because, you know, being in an area where you have the, the working class people, you know, raising their families and putting their kids into those programs, we really didn't have to deal with that type of violence.
Story_ID: 663453
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now, tell me--now, now, you started in '87 [1987] and I have a note here about you attending the All-American basketball camp in Santa Clara, California.  Now, now, what is--what, what, what happened there?  Was that for--what was--
Speaker 2: Well, that pretty much started--I joined my local high school association and started doing--and the association was the Los Angeles officiating unit [California Basketball Officials Association, Los Angeles Unit], and once I got into that, did very well.  And what happens is, as a referee, once you start doing high school, you at that point in time, I was, was able--I--that--my first and second year, I made it to the city finals, CIF [California Interscholastic Federation] and state finals.  You then--in the summertime, you would go to a camp to better your skills because you--then, you would have--having that opportunity to maybe advance yourself into college officiating.  So, for me, I went to that All-American officials camp, again, to get seen by college coordinators to see if I can possibly have that opportunity to advance from high school into the college level, and that's where I attended that camp, did very, very well.  And my first--you know, for me, that was my first opportunity.  I was chosen--I got hired by three Division I conferences, which at the time, I didn't even know how well I had done until later, but looking back on it now, that was everything because that can determine how well or how far you can advance in your college career because that's, that's the ultimate goal with every college referee is to get into a college conference, and those college conferences were for Division I, which you normally have to work your way up.  You start at high school, junior college, Division III, Division II, but Division I is your ultimate goal.  For me, I jumped into Division I extremely fast coming out of high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, the conferences we're talking about, the three, were the Big West [Big West Conference], the West Coast [West Coast Conference], and the Pac 10 [Pacific 10 Conference; Pacific 12 Conference].
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: This is big--yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, I was big--that was big time.  You know, and I didn't even realize for myself how big it was.
Speaker 1: And you were still in your twenties.
Speaker 2: I was--(laughter) I was a young--I was very young when I started, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--and when you say they hired you, what, what does that mean?  'Cause most of us have--haven't been referees; we don't know that that means.  What, what does it mean that they hired you?
Speaker 2: Well, what that means, for, for any college referee or any--I would say any--yeah, any college referee--I was gonna say Division I, but it's really college period, what you are, you're an independent contractor, and so every year, those college conferences actually give you a contract for the year.  And what's--what most people don't realize is that at the end of the basketball season, that contract expires and then for the start of the next season, you end up signing another contract and what that means is, is that you will work games for those particular conferences, and that's pretty much how it works for any official working college basketball even in today's college basketball.
Speaker 1: So, at the beginning of or before the season, I guess, starts, they send out a schedule?  Do, do they ask when you're available or, or do they just give you a set of dates you have to plug into or how, how does it work?
Speaker 2: They actually just send you out a schedule.  Now, if you have--for, for me, because I was still--I still had my full-time job [at the Rancho Cienega Sports Complex, Los Angeles, California].  If I had some conflicts with the schedule, I would, you know, call the coordinator of officials and say, you know what?  I can't work this date, this date, this date, but for me, I was so fortunate, being a recreation director and I had such a great staff and my administrator was extremely supportive, that I was able to work my schedule where I could take off.  So, for me, I never really had to give any games back.  I mean, any game any coordinator gave me, I was--I was ready to work.
Speaker 1: So, so, how much can you make doing this, say per game?
Speaker 2: I can--you know, that--now, that's a great question.  When I--my first Division I game, I made two hundred fifty dollars a game.  When I left college basketball to go into the NBA [National Basketball Association], I was making three hundred dollars a game as a Division I referee.
Story_ID: 663454
Speaker 1: And what's interesting because now, I've, I've kind of went full circle, which we'll probably talk about that as well; I'm a coordinator of officials for those conferences today, my top tier referee makes twenty-eight fifty [$2850] a game and it goes to show you how time has changed, how the sport of officiating has grown.
Speaker 2: This is Division I college basketball?
Speaker 1: This is Division I.
Speaker 2: Twenty-eight hundred dollars and fifty cents a game?
Speaker 1: Twenty-eight fifty.  That--for--that's for a tier one and, and now, it's actually--and that's a flat fee.  Most--for most colleges now, you have a tier one, tier two, tier three, and some conferences have tier four.  For me, I just have three tiers.  But, the top tier, Pac 12 [Pacific 12 Conference], twenty-eight fifty a game.  It's incredible.  I think it's, it's--for a college referee, that's a lot of money for two hours.
Speaker 2: So, is there--is there increased competition for these positions then today?
Speaker 1: Absolutely, extremely competitive.  I mean, 'cause again, you know, for a college referee today, a lot of them, they can do this for a living.  A lot of them still have full-time jobs.  But, you know, versus when I started, no one had a full-time job because, again, you, you wasn't making enough money per game, you know, with me making two hundred and fifty, three hundred dollars, and we didn't have the whole flat fee thing when I was--when I started.  So, of course, when I started, you would--you would--that was just the game fee, but you still got a little travel, they gave you a per diem every day.  So, by the time you received your check, it was probably anywhere from eight hundred to twelve hundred dollars versus today, going to the flat fee, you know, you just think, if you have--if you're working fifty or sixty games at that amount of money, that's a nice little salary that you could make either whether it's part-time or full-time, doesn't really matter.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's a nice--that's a nice living.
Speaker 1: That's a nice living (laughter).
Speaker 2: It is.  It is a nice living.  Now, so, are the--are the rules radically different from high school to college level?
Speaker 1: Not really, no.  The rules--versus just--normally, there's just a couple of things that are different.  The difference is between college and, and NBA [National Basketball Association]--and professional is where you get the, the biggest difference.  But, from high school to col- you know, we--there's, there's not that many differences.  And I think the one thing in both levels that they've tried to do is, they try to make the leagues a little more consistent from high school to college, so there's not that, that many differences.  Now, there are a little differences between men and women, but they're very, very small because they're really trying to, to those--break those gaps, too, because they kind of want the game to be the same through--for--between men and women, high school and college.
Story_ID: 663455
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so, you officiated your first NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association]--well, no.  When was your first NCAA game?  When did you officiate that?  Was that '88 [1988], '89 [1989]?
Speaker 2: Eighty--my first NCAA--oh, I got--now you're getting me years.  Wow.  I started in '89 [1989], '90 [1990]--let's see, I got in the--I, I, I tend to do better going backwards.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: Ninety-seven [1997], I end up leaving NCAA to go to the NBA [National Basketball Association].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I worked four Final Fours [NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament], so I end up, '93 [1993].
Speaker 1: Okay.  'Cause your first NCAA Final Four, it says here it was '94 [1994].  So--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and your first game was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I was fortunate.  My first game, I--this was what's--something that a lot of people don't know about me.  I--that was literally my first year getting into the NCAA.  My first year getting into the NCAA, I worked so well that I went all the way to the Final Four.  It was the most craziest year.  I literally got a phone call for the first round, went and worked my game, came home thinking, okay, I'm done, did real well, was, was so happy about my season, got another phone call, second round.  I went, okay.  Didn't--and I--and which I knew that I had done well, but not knowing that I had done that well, end up getting another phone call for the semifinals--no, I'm sorry, for the quarterfinals, and when Marcy Weston called me and told me that I was going to the Final Four, I was stunned.  So, I literally--which has probably never been heard of that my first year in the NCAA Division I tournament as an official, I went all the way through to the--and, and worked my first Final Four and stayed, continued to work Final Fours until I left in 1997--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and to get hired in the NBA.
Story_ID: 663456
Speaker 1: All right.  So, there was a consensus that you knew what you were doing on a level.
Speaker 2: There were several people that told me that they saw that I had--I had it, you know.  And, and I can honestly say, not only did they say it, I think--my, my mother [Gussie Palmer] told the best story.  I took my mother--this was when I was a college referee, and my mother loved going to Las Vegas [Nevada].  That was probably one of her fav- and still is one of her favorite places to go.  She loved pulling one arm bandits, so--the slot machines.  I take my mother with me, I was working UNLV [University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada], she, she comes, she comes to the game.  After the game, her and I, we--you know, we get on the plane, we're sitting there, we're just chatting and, and so I said, "Ma, what do you think?"  She said, "You know what, Vi [HistoryMaker Violet Palmer]?"  She said, "Not everyone in this world can find their God given talent."  She said, "I just watched my daughter--you have found your God given talent."  She said, "You referee with ease."  She said, "You don't have to think about it, you just--you just--you just do it."  She says, "And I could really tell, this is something.  You found your talent."  And she says, "I don't know what you're gonna do in it.  I don't know--you--I'm--I know--," she said, "you're always successful in everything that you try," but she knew that I would be successful, never knowing that, of course, having that opportunity to jump from being a col- a women's college referee into getting into the NBA, but she knew something, you know.  She just--she saw it right off the bat, which I think is probably one--gave me that, that, that validation that I found it, you know, and, and I wasn't even trying to find it, I just really enjoyed it and advanced extremely well, you know.  But, when my mother told me that, that, that just--the, the, the light bulb, light bulb just went off and I knew that I was gonna be extremely successful.
Speaker 1: Now, that had to be really important coming from someone--you--your mother, you said she tried to discourage you from being such, such a tomboy at a early age and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but she got over that real fast, no.  Literally, after she realized how important sports were and how, how much I enjoyed it and--she really just--after the whole Little League thing, you know--and, again, she, she still tried a little bit, you know, to bring me in the house and say, "Oh, come on, let's cook."  And I--and I--to this day, I tell her it's her fault that I'm really not a good cook because she allowed me to play all my sports and stay outside and, and do all my activities.  But, I think in the end, she knew.  Sports was where my love was.  And then once she watched me as a--as a referee, she just--she pretty much just solidified it and told, told the story and said it to me, I mean just--I mean, right off the bat, she, she knew it.  And then even going forward when I told her, I said, "Mom, you know, I'm, I'm gonna get some training for the NBA."  She says, "Well, I don't know--I don't know what you--I don't know what they're doing, but I guarantee you," she said, "if you wanna get a job in the National Basketball Association," she said, "you're gonna get a job."  She said, "There's no doubt about it; I already know."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She had stamped it before any--before I--you know, I got--I really got into the program, before I got my feet wet, before I, I understood anything about it, my mother told me that I was gonna do it.
Speaker 1: That was a possibility for you.  That's something that you can see down the line.
Speaker 2: Oh, no question.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No question.
Story_ID: 663457
Speaker 1: Now tell us something about what it takes to become--I mean, not, not to become a referee, but to actually be a referee.  I mean, we, we, we alluded to the fact that you have to be in some kind of shape to run up and down the court and stay out of the way and still make the right call, right?
Speaker 2: Without a doubt.  You have to be extremely--you know, you gotta have really tough skin to be a referee.  You gotta know how to take scrutiny.  You gotta know how to not take things personal.  You have to understand that you have to stand by your decisions.  You--it's--you know, being an, an official, you have to make split second decisions.  You have to trust your instincts.  You have to have the confidence to go out and to understand that you're gonna be--you can be 50 percent wrong and 50 percent right every time going out and it doesn't matter, you know because that's just somebody has to lose and somebody has to win or one side is gonna like your call and the other side is not.  Whether--you, you could--they can not like it and you're still right.  And I think understanding those things, once you get that understanding, it doesn't matter.  You just trust yourself and you know that every night, you're gonna have to deal with the scrutiny of being scrutinized on every single call that you make.  You know that people are not really yelling at you personally.  You can't take things--take things personal.  You have to know, understand that it's all about once you put the shirt on that they're really just yelling at that person--you know, it's that, that--almost, you can take the darts and you got a (unclear) at those darts and they can just throw them at your chest and they can just--feel like they can say whatever they want to say.  So, most referees have to understand that nothing is personal because I would always say to myself, they don't even know me, first of all, so I can't take things personal.  But, those are just a, a few of the things that you have to have once you decide to become a referee, you know, and they just kind of go with the territory.
Story_ID: 663458
Speaker 1: Now, did you initially start--you, you were doing women's games, right, in the beginning (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was doing all women's games in--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --from--doing high school and college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I only worked women's games.  And was fortunate enough, like I said earlier, to be--become very successful, end up working, you know, the Final Fours [NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament] and, and the championship games, and through that is where literally I received a phone call from Dr. Aaron Wade [Aaron C. Wade]--he's the late Dr. Aaron Wade.  He was an assistant to Darell Garretson, which was the director of officiating for the National Basketball Association.  And what was so funny is that how you go back to Dr. Aaron Wade was good friends with Mr. Booker Turner, and Booker Turner was an icon in my high school--the L.A. Unit in my high school association [California Basketball Officials Association, Los Angeles Unit], and he knew me very, very well.  He was a men's referee himself.  Dr. Aaron Wade called Booker on the phone and said, "Hey, you know what?  I have seen this young lady and I know she lives in Los Angeles [California], do you know of her?"  And Booker Turner said, "Of course, you know, I--of course I know her.  Here's her--," he gave him--gave him my phone number.  So, Dr. Aaron Wade, long story short, calls me on the phone, tells me who he is and that he had seen me work an NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] playoff game and that--asked me if I would be interested in some NBA training.  He kind of gave me a little background.  He said the NBA was gonna be looking to train women in their program, and he said, "You know, from watching you, I just--I think that you're very talented, would you be interested?"  I literally thought the phone call was a joke when he called me because, of course, I never had any aspirations to officiate in the NBA, let alone didn't even think the NBA was even looking to hire women.  It had never been done.
Speaker 1: At the time, were, were there any women officiating the NCAA men's games?
Speaker 2: No, not at all.  At--you know and, again, I've, I've gone through that adversity where was--at one point, John Dangleis for the--he was the Big West [Big West Conference] coordinator of officials, he was thinking about--he actually brought me to a training to see if I could work on the men's side and the men--all hell broke loose.  They were--they literally were like, what are you doing here?  Why are you here?  You don't--you have--you know, you, you have too many games on the women's side.  They were so intimated that I really think that for what he was trying to do, that's why they didn't--they actually didn't follow through.  So, of course, once getting the phone call from the NBA, you know, to, to get into the NBA program, I didn't think that that was serious.
Speaker 1: Now, now, now, let me add this to this mix here.  In those days and even now, men can coach women's teams, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And nobody seems to think anything is wrong.
Speaker 2: It's not a--no, it's--there's not a problem.  And men--here's, here's--men could officiate on the women's side, but women, there's no women on the men's side, you know, and that's--to, to this day.  Right now, it's like that.  So for me, receiving this phone call as far as the NBA, I really didn't think that was serious.  But, after talking to Dr. Wade--and he just--used to tell the story, you know, all the time how, you know, he would call certain people or call different men's officials and they would go, oh my god, it's the Dr. Aar- Dr. Aaron Wade calling me from the National Basketball Association, he says, and he used to tell the story.  He said, "Oh, I called Ms. Palmer [HistoryMaker Violet Palmer], she didn't even know who I was," because I really didn't, you know.  But, of course, after having this conversation with him, I thought, you know what?  Yeah, he asked me would I be interested in some training.  I was thinking to myself, why not?  What's the worse could happen?  It's--it was free.  He told me it didn't cost me anything.  There would--for me, I thought it was training so I could become a better referee, so why not try to do it on the men's side?  So, I didn't think nothing of it.  He asked me to send him some, some of my college video tapes.  He told me that he would be sending me the NBA rule books and mechanics manual.  I took those, glanced over them a--you know, a little bit, that summer, invited me to an NBA training.
Story_ID: 663459
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this.  I, I mentioned movement and being in shape to be able to move.  Is there a choreography that a referee performs, and I don't know if that's the right word, but is there a set of movements that you perform on a court when the ball is coming up the court and how you--do, do you--do you station yourself in certain--do you run to a certain spot?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, and, and, you know--
Speaker 2: Well, it's really--it's based on where the ball is, but we do--we referee via a, a manual, an officiating manual, and that manual, of course, tells you when you're in the lead position--the court is kind of divided in between a third, a third, and a third, and it's divided between a lead position, a trail position, and a slot position.  So, it's divided between those three (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So it's three refs.
Speaker 2: --people.  But depending upon where the ball goes and who has the foul, you actually end up switching every time someone has a foul or a violation.  So, you end up being in all those different positions at any point in time during the game based on the way, the, the way the manual is written.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  And they have a manual--I mean, the rest of it is what, what are the rules and what constitutes a foul and--
Speaker 2: Correct.  Yeah, those are the guidelines, the, the rules that you have to abide by--abide by and then you have the guidelines that--which tells you what--you could do as far as the guard play on the perimeter and then you have rules that take care of the post play.  You have--you know, so you have those things that you--not only just the rules of the game, but then you have those guidelines that you have--that in every game, you have to--an official has to make sure that that game is ran according to those guidelines.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Now, just--now, this, this is science again, but it seems to me that the NBA has more rules than the NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association], is that, that true?
Speaker 2: I would think that they do.  But, you know, in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It's getting close now--
Speaker 2: They're--
Speaker 1: --'cause I know they have the shot clock when nobody else had that.
Speaker 2: Well, no, there's a shot clock for college.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at one time there wasn't.  They had--you know, they, they had a piece on this morning about Dean Smith running the four corners at North Carolina [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --where you could just stand out there and pass that thing until the other team got so upset that they would try to get the ball and he would like drive in and probably score, you know, a layup or something.
Speaker 2: Well, very true.  But, I think--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --the biggest difference is, is that the shot clock in the National Basketball Association is twenty-four seconds versus the shot clock in men's basketball is thirty-five seconds.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they have a little bit longer (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And for women, it's thirty seconds.  So, there's the difference in time between all three.  So, of course, in an NBA game, the game is just a lot quicker because, you know, you only have twenty-four seconds to shoot.
Speaker 1: And if you don't shoot the ball, it goes to the other team.
Speaker 2: It goes to the other team.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: All right.  And there are rules about being in the paint, in the--there's a--there's a--
Speaker 2: Yes.  In the NBA, you not only have--you have an offensive three seconds, but you have a defensive three seconds as well, meaning that a defender can't just sit in the lane--
Speaker 1: And camp out there.
Speaker 2: --and camp out there versus in college, you don't--you don't have that.  So, I think those are the big differences between the two versus--between the NBA game and the collegiate game.
Speaker 1: I think since I've been watching basketball, they came up with this restricted zone thing, too, which is a, a place where you--if you're standing there still--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and you get--somebody runs into you, you're--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --it's a foul on them if you're outside the zone.  If you're in the zone, it's a foul on you.
Speaker 2: Well, it's--to, to make it kind of basic so that I think in layman's terms, the, the restricted arc was put in place to keep the lane open because, of course--and the NBA was the first to bring this restricted arc, put it into fruition.  So, what it does is, is that it doesn't allow for any secondary defender to just camp out and sit there to block shots or to take charges underneath the basket.  That's pretty much why that arc was put in place.  So, what it does is, is that if I--if I'm--if a--if a primary defender is refereeing me and I now beat my primary defender and that secondary defender, if that secondary defender is within the arc, it's automatically a blocking foul.  So, for that defensive secondary defender, that defender would have to be in front of the arc to now receive a charge.  So, it pretty much trying to prev- prevent secondary defenders from just sitting in the lane, clogging it up because in the NBA game, they want a free flowing game because people like to watch the dunks and, and like to watch the athletic moves and you can't have all that if the lane is clogged up.  So, they put the arc in there to keep the lane open, and that's really what it was put in--put in existence for.  And college basketball actually just--I think it was three years ago, they actually put the arc in their game, which they took from the professional game because they felt like it was a way--again, 'cause they needed to, to, to keep their lane open, too, because, of course, it, it takes scoring up.  It's about scoring.  People--you know, that's, that's what's exciting.  People want to see the athletic moves.  They want to see the dunks.  They want to see, you know, players able to shoot, you know, go into the lane.  And, again, if you're--if you're allowed to just camp in that lane, no one wants to watch--you know, that--that's not exciting.
Story_ID: 663460
Speaker 1: So, are you--are you old enough to remember when dunking was outlawed?  No, you were born in '64 [1964].
Speaker 2: No, I was there, yes.  I--
Speaker 1: But, you were a--you were a toddler, I guess--
Speaker 2: I was very--yes.
Speaker 1: --when Lew Alcindor [Kareem Abdul-Jabbar] then, you know, played college ball at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California]--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --and they outlawed the dunk, specifically to stop him from dunking.
Speaker 2: From dunking the ball.  Well, see, that was--to me, that's put in place to actually stop someone who was tall, athletic, and just was better than everybody.
Speaker 1: Just completely dominant.
Speaker 2: Just completely dom- they, they, they were trying to figure out a way, which that didn't work either because they eventually had to put it back.  But, here again, that's how talented players are.  There's no way--I mean, there's no way--I, I, I--I mean, mind you, that's comical to me that they actually wanted to take that out because someone is so talented to prevent them from being able to do something that other players are not able to do.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah, it, it happened, and I remember that and, and as I said, Dean Smith's North Carolina [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina] spread, you know, four corners where they would--he would just--
Speaker 2: They--passing to--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --to passing to just keep it on the perimeter.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Which, can you imagine?  Look how boring that is.
Speaker 1: It was boring and people booed, but within the rules, now--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --it was successful.  It was--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --within those rules.
Speaker 2: You're right.  You're right.
Speaker 1: You know, you couldn't--you couldn't doubt his success.  I mean, it's something he used to his advantage.  There's a book, I don't know if you ever seen it called 'Elevating the Game' ['Elevating the Game: Black Men and Basketball'] by Nelson George, a young writer, probably about your age, and he's--writes for the hip hop generation and that sort of thing.  But, he--in 'Elevating the Game,' he talks about how black people have changed basketball from its early days when they had peach baskets up and all that and how they were shooting with two hands and, you know, coming up with things like jump shots and dunks and all kind--you know, things that did not exist at one time.  He--I think there's a story in there he has about Sweetwater Clifton [Nathaniel "Sweetwater" Clifton] making a behind the back pass in the Knicks [New York Knicks] training camp and creating a--a, a guy wanted to fight him for--
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: --passing the ball behind his back.  You know, you're not--you're not supposed to do that, you know, in basketball.  And that's--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: For me, that was the--but, of course, other people--I mean, even Europeans have learned to do a lot of things that black basketball players created.  Do you have any thoughts about that?
Speaker 2: I just think, you know what?  They, they can try to create rules or change things in the game to stop good players from doing certain things and it just doesn't work because, you know, we are so athletic and so strong and so quick that--I've seen some of the most incredible things done on a basketball court.  So--and, and, and, you know, been around long enough in, in just--in, in basketball and officiating that they try and try and try again to change rules and do things to, to stop it, but it's impossible.  Because any time or whatever rule they--that they try to put in, players are so talented that they're gonna find a way around it.  And it--it's just--you know, it's almost like they just keep butting their heads up against a wall because it's not gonna work.  They try, but our players are just athletic, they're just quick, they're just talented, and they can just do things, you know.  When you--and I've seen the best of the best.  I've seen, you know, Michael Jordan.  I've seen Charles Barkley.  I've seen--
Speaker 1: And you've seen them up close.
Speaker 2: I've seen them--I've been (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You've been on the floor--
Speaker 2: --on the floor with them.
Speaker 1: --with them.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: On the court with them, you know.  You know, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James.  I, I go, these men are incredible and extremely talented.  So, again, doesn't really matter what rule we put in.
Story_ID: 663461
Speaker 1: Now, I think--I think, though, that today, to--in, in fairness, the NBA has really tried to make the game more exciting with the rules--
Speaker 2: Without a doubt.
Speaker 1: --like you were just suggesting with the restricted zone and other things.  But--and snapback rims so if you dunk, the rim--you don't break the whole structure down.  I mean, they, they want you to dunk now.
Speaker 2: They do.  But, they still have rules in place where, you know, it--it's still not gonna take away from the game because even with a player being able to dunk and with the--with the snapback of the rim, again, if he dunks it and he stays on the rim and if the ball is in the cylinder or the ball is still on the rim, that's offensive basket interference.  So, what the NBA has done is they do--they have done a really, really good job with their rules to keep the game exciting because that's really what's, what's the difference between a collegiate game and a professional game, is that the professional game is about entertainment.  It's a game where fans want to see the best players in the world show their athletic ability and talent.  So, within those guidelines with the NBA, and I think that's probably one of the most difficult things for an--for an NBA referee to learn how to do coming from the college side to the NBA side, is that within those guidelines, but you still have to run the game.  You still have to--those players have to abide by those guidelines, but understanding that we're still dealing with entertainment, which I think what makes the sixty NBA referees the best in the world.  Because to be able to do that, you're--you have to be extremely talented.  You have to be a student of the craft of officiating, to study, to, to learn, to, to understand the guidelines that the NBA has given us to, to control the game because through all of that, you still gotta--you gotta be that guardian of the game, but in a sense--and, and understand that it's still entertainment.  And I think for the sixty and, and being fortunate to be one of those sixty, it's, it's incredible how talented our officials are and how talented our players are in the National Basketball Association.
Story_ID: 663462
Speaker 1: You refereed your first NBA [National Basketball Association] game--now, well you started with the WNBA [Women's National Basketball Association], right?  Or did-okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  I worked the, the inaugural season for the WNBA, '97 [1997], and I was fortunate.  You know, again, I was fortunate.  I worked the first game for the WNBA in '97 [1997] and went--worked through the season and end up working the championship game, the last game of the season for the WNBA.  And after that summer, I got hired the following October and became an NBA referee.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now the WNBA championship was the first one--I just want to mention that Cynthia Cooper [Cynthia Cooper-Dyke] on the Houston Comets--
Speaker 2: Oh my god, incredible--Sheryl Swoopes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And those are legends to this day.  Again, I was fortunate enough--I was at, at the hall of fame [Women's Basketball Hall of Fame, Knoxville, Tennessee] this past--when did I--it was October and--where Sheryl Swoopes received--she was inducted into the hall of fame and it was so wonderful to hug her and, and just congratulate her, you know, just--'cause, of course, I, I officiated her during my--when she was at Texas Tech [Texas Tech University, Lubbock, Texas].  You know, for me, it comes full circle, being a college referee and then getting into the WNBA and now getting into NB- and then officiating in the NBA.  So, for some--for me personally, it really touched my heart because I've known her since she was a college basketball player and, and had a chance to, you know--fortunate enough to referee her in the WNBA and be in the--in the audience when she received her award.  I was extremely happy for her.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, one of the first games of the '97 [1997] NBA season, you officiated.  This is your first game in the--in the NBA.  It was Grizzlies [Vancouver Grizzlies; Memphis Grizzlies] versus Magic [Orlando Magic] in Vancouver, Canada (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, it was actually Grizzlies versus Dallas--
Speaker 1: Dallas?
Speaker 2: --Dallas Mavericks.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, Dallas.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, again, that was--oh my god.  That was a whirlwind.  That was--that whole--that was probably one of the most stressful times of my life.  I was petrified, scared out of my wits.  There was so much build up once I received the phone call from Rod Thorn that I had gotten hired to, to be in the--in the NBA and I can honestly say, that first game, I was scared.  But, I knew that I was prepared and I had prepared myself and that I was ready and up for the challenge and was extremely excited to go out and work.  But, all I wanted, you know--all I can remember is, I'll never forget.  We got out of the car, we pull up at the en- you know, at the arena, we walk into the tunnel and all I heard was, you know, camera people and light--and, and lights were flashing, they were taking pictures, and, and I just heard all these whispers.  "Okay, the, the lady is here.  The woman is here.  She--she's here," you know.  And, and, and I'm, I'm hearing all this background noise and I'm going, oh my god, can we just get this game started?  You know, because, of course, Dee and I, we had had all these interviews once they announced that they were going to hire us.  We had had all these--we--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now, Dee is Dee Kantner.
Speaker 2: Dee Kantner, yes.
Speaker 1: Kantner, okay.  And, and she, she was--
Speaker 2: She was hired with me.
Speaker 1: --with of you.
Speaker 2: Yes.  We were both hired.  We, we were the first two--we got hired together but I--being fortunate, I was--I worked the first NBA game.  I actually worked my first two games before she actually worked her first game.  So, that's how I officially got the, the title of being the first and only at that time female to referee a, a professional sport.
Story_ID: 663463
Speaker 1: All right.  So, but the reception, I mean, Charles Barkley announced that the NBA [National Basketball Association] is a man's game in--
Speaker 2: True statement.
Speaker 1: --in criticism of you.
Speaker 2: True statement.  I think I pretty much got criticized by some of everybody, you know.  And I can honestly say that not only did the players and the coaches bark about it, I think even initially starting out, my own colleagues, they wasn't too happy about it either because, again, it was--you know, the NBA was a good ol' boys system.  It was a man's world, and now bringing a woman in--into it, they, they wasn't sure.  They didn't--you know, and I think it was just the, the unknown.  People tend to not like change, you know, and, and I think, for me, they wasn't sure.  They said can we touch her?  Can we yell at her?  Can we still curse?  You know, how is she gonna react?  Is she physically fit to, to be able to go out and, and do the job?  So, there was just all these unknown things and I think that was really--nothing personal against me.  I think it was more so just un- that un- unforbidden territory that a woman had never--had never done, so that was all the negative things.  And, and I can honestly say that, you know, after getting in it and, and earning my keep and earning my respect even for someone like Charles Barkley--I'll never forget.  It was probably my third or fourth year, I was in Houston [Texas] and I had just finished working a game with Charles Barkley and I'm coming out with my, my partners and Charles came up to me and he said, "You know what?  I was wrong.  I stand corrected."  He said, "For me to say what I've--what I said about you," he said, "I was totally wrong," and he pointed and he pointed at my partners he said, "because you're better than him and him."  And we just kind of all chuckled and laughed and, you know--you know--you know, we just laughed and, and walked away.  But, I said to myself, you know what?  What, what great respect I had--for him to, to--'cause he didn't have to say that.  He could've just, you know, thought it.  But for him to literally say it to me after a game, I think that just really, you know, just meant, meant a lot and it kind of solidified that, you know what?  A woman can do this, and not that I was really purposely going out to change people's perceptions or minds.  I just felt like, you know what?  I had prepared myself, I had worked hard, and I knew that I could do the job, and it was about doing the job for me.  That was what's--what was most important.
Speaker 1: Now, did, did you consider or do you have any thoughts on why the NBA decided to, to hire women referees in the first place?
Speaker 2: You know, and I'm not sure.  I, I, I think, you know, it, it could've been--you know, they had--at one point, they had another female, Sandy Ortiz [Sandra Ortiz-Del Valle].  I think she initially had started and was trying to work her way in the program and for some reason, she didn't make it, and I think she actually at one point tried to sue them.  So, I don't know if that was the reasoning behind bringing us into the program; I have no idea.  But, I can honestly say that for whatever reason they had, you know, and, and just knowing how the commissioner, David Stern, was.  He was always extremely innovative in what he's done, you know, even bringing international players and how he's--how he would do contracts and, and bring in--how he brought in, you know, all the television and, and, and taking, taking in European players.  So, for him to now open up that door to allow women into the NBA program, does it really surprise me?  No, you know--
Speaker 1: The reason why I ask is because it's such a proactive move to do something that's diverse rather than (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  Well, and I truly believe that the NBA is, is just a, a, a cor- company that that's just the way they are.  They're very innovative and have always been.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what was the, the, the toughest part of that first year?
Speaker 2: Toughest part of my first year in the NBA [National Basketball Association] was just all the scrutiny, just being in a fish bowl.  And, for me, just like that first game in Vancouver [Canada], just--I really personally felt like people were expecting me to fail.  They just knew it was gonna happen.  They just knew that I wouldn't make it, that I, I didn't have the intestinal fortitude, I was a woman, I was too soft, I, I wasn't quick enough, I couldn't keep up.  You know, there was just so many different things that were com- that--and I--at a point, I just got to a point where I didn't--I didn't want to read about it, I didn't want to hear what the commentators were saying or hear what the newspaper were writing because it really didn't matter to me because I knew.  I knew that I had trained, I had worked, I had the work ethic, I had the intestinal fortitude, I had the attitude that I could do the job and I just wanted my work to speak for me.  I--that was where in my--in my mind that I was just concerned with the work and I said, I--all the naysayers, I will silence you with my ability to just do my job.  And I think that was just the--what I took going forward and never looked back.
Speaker 1: And a lot of the players, to be fair though, were in favor of it and thought you deserved a chance, Dennis Rodman, Michael Jordan, others.  But, but you come in under the--you know, the additional scrutiny of--you're, you're famous before you even do anything (laughter).
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: You know, for not--just being there.
Speaker 2: For just being there.
Speaker 1: For--
Speaker 2: Just being a woman and, and, again, it was just that unforbidden territory.  I think it was not--people just not understanding or players and, and coaches and even, you know, fans, just because it was something had--that had never been done and, and, and going back, I think people have problems with change.  Any time you bring change into--to the effect, you know, into the equation, you just get all the--you get backlash.
Speaker 1: Yeah, most of the time after the game is over, people forget who the referees were.  I mean, really--I mean, there's certain names in the NBA, ref- I, I can't think of a college referee, but Darell Garretson's name who was broadcast so much on television, everybody kind of knew who Darell was (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, icon.
Speaker 1: So, he's an iconic--
Speaker 2: Icon.  I mean, we have several.  We have, you know, Joey Crawford, you have Danny Crawford (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Joey Crawford, right.
Speaker 2: --I mean, you just have--you have--you have referees in the NBA--I mean, even in college now as well, but in the NBA that people just know them across the world.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right.
Speaker 2: And it's interesting because even looking at myself and I've never even thought of myself like this and, and even now, for myself, to put myself in that category and--but I think the one positive thing is that I'm in that category as a respected, good referee and it--and, and for that, it has--it had nothing to do with me being a woman because, because of the work and because of how well I've done and, and my--the years that I was able to, to stay into the league, it just got to a point where people just said, you know what?  Male or female, it doesn't matter.  You're just a good referee.  And I think that solidified me in my career, you know, as well as there's a lot of other things that, that did it.  But, for me personally, that's all I was looking for.
Story_ID: 663465
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It's u- there's no guarantees that you're going to be known for being good unless you actually are 'cause I know in Chicago [Illinois], the most famous referee for the Bulls [Chicago Bulls] has always been Hue Hollins because he--the foul he called against Scottie Pippen in, in the ninety--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --ninety-four [1994] playoffs.  Everybody thought it was a, a, a bogus foul and, you know, he--that's what--when you say Hue Hollins of Chicago, people think, ah, that ref--that guy that--
Speaker 2: Right.  They--I mean, they just automatically don't like him.
Speaker 1: Hey and the other woman that came into the league with you as a referee, Dee Kantner, she actually was dismissed by the NBA [National Basketball Association], right?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: For, for, we suppose, substandard performance.
Speaker 2: That's pretty much what we were told.  You know, again, you don't--you don't know.  But, that was pretty much the way it went down, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, there's still no guarantee you're gonna--I mean, it's not once you're in, you're in 'cause you're, you're--
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  You, you, you have to understand.  I mean, I think the, the biggest difference between once you--getting hired into the NBA and, and college is that you have to understand that now, you know, you're not doing this for fun.  This, this--once, once--when I got hired in the NBA, I had to quit my job as a recreation director and this is now my livelihood.  This is how I now--it's gonna take care of myself and my family.  So, for me, you know, the, the, the scrutiny and the--you have the stress and, and there's anything else you can think of because now, you know that you have to--every year, you're graded, you're, you're scrutinized, you, you, you--they chart every call.  Everything we do is on a--is, is on a higher level because now you're doing it for your livelihood, which makes all the difference in the world.
Story_ID: 663466
Speaker 1: Now, had they--well, let me--okay.  Let me just say this, now, you did your first NBA [National Basketball Association] playoff game in 2006, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You're forty-two years old at this point and it's the Pacers [Indiana Pacers] and the New Jersey Nets [Brooklyn Nets], right?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: Huge accomplishment, just--you know, I can't even tell you how excited, how--not only getting hired--you know, when, when I got hired, I thought I had really did it, to be honest with you.  I thought, I'm like, wow, this is--this, this, this is something that I just never imagined.  But, having--once I was chosen to be in the playoffs solidified my career as an NBA referee because that right there puts you--you're now--not only are you the best--you're on a--you're on a staff of sixty people, the best in the world, but you're the best amongst those sixty people.  And that just says something because now you're at the top of your craft.  And for--with all the scrutiny that I had went through going forward, I just never thought that I would have that opportunity.  So, my hard work, my perseverance, my struggles had really paid off because, again, went back to my work ethic because you're not gonna get chosen for the playoffs unless you're one of the best on the staff.
Story_ID: 663467
Speaker 1: Now, you handled a--kind of a crisis earlier that year when the Denver Nuggets and the New York Knicks, I think, had a brawl on the court (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, my god, one of the worst games of my whole entire career.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Literally, I had--the whole bench cleared off of a--
Speaker 1: What happened?  I, I think J.R. Smith was fouled hard by somebody, right?
Speaker 2: He was fouled hard and the game was a blowout, and the Knicks--I'm sorry, and Denver thought that the Knicks were really just trying to show them--show them up, you know.  Because, again, once the score gets so, so--you know, the, the, the, the score--the, the, the discrepancy was so large that they feel like, okay, let's just play this out and we're done.  And, of course, the Knicks go in, try to make this, you know, fancy dunk, didn't go over well with Denver, hard foul, all hell breaks loose.  I'm standing there and thank god that the play I was in, I was down the court coming up and me standing there looking at all those players leave that bench.  I don't think I've ever been scared before.  I honestly stood at midcourt and said to myself, oh my god, and literally had a--you know, I think--it kind of flashed before my eyes, felt like possibly my career may be over.  Because, you know, this, this--it had never happened.  And I can honestly say, I was with the legendary Dick Bavetta, and this man was incredible.  He cleared the--got the benches cleared, got us together, we gathered all this information.  And I was with one of--I was with Robbie Robinson.  And I want to say this was Robbie Robinson's--it was like his second year in the league, you know.  So, he was a deer with the headlights, had no clue as to what was going on.  So, Dick asked me a couple of questions.  He's--you know, and we just went through it.  He cleared the benches, gave all these technical fouls, we started the game, played--and it--mind you, and this happened with like a minute and a half to go in the game.  We thought the game was over.  And afterwards, just sitting in that locker room, I could--I, I really had a flash and felt like I wasn't gonna make it, that, you know, at the end of that season, the league was gonna say, you know what?  You just--you--we, we are no longer gonna hire--we're no longer gonna keep you on staff.  And for me, getting through that and still getting chosen to work the playoffs was a--was a--was a--more than a relief.
Speaker 1: Did you think that you made some kind of mistake or did you--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --think that they thought you made a mistake?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, you just really never know.  Once--how you feel when it first happened and being on the--on the--on, on the court at the time and then after because we had to write reports and we had to do film sessions and--or, or we had to sit with our boss and we had to tell--you had to talk to security to tell them what happened.  Now, when you're going through all these different things, you're thinking to yourself, oh my god, you know.  And I don't think at any point in time my job was ever in jeopardy, but I'm just being honest to say that how I felt--you know, you have those flashes of, you know, your career to not know whether or not you're gonna be able to recover.  So, for me, I was so worried about losing my job that I never even thought I would--let alone can work through it and now get to the playoffs.  But, once I made it to the playoffs, I knew that that solidified me in my NBA [National Basketball Association] career because there is officials that have been in our league that has never had an opportunity to work the playoffs.  So, for me, not only going through all the scrutiny, not only being a woman, I now was chosen to be one of the best of sixty people, but one of the best to ever--in, in those sixty people to work the playoffs.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you remember who won the playoffs that year?  'Cause I'm, I'm trying to even think of who did it, you know.
Speaker 2: Wow.
Speaker 1: Was it the Lakers [Los Angeles Lakers] or?  It may have been the Lakers.
Speaker 2: You know what?  I think it was the Lakers that won [sic. San Antonio Spurs].
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I think so.  I think so.
Story_ID: 663468
Speaker 1: Two thousand seven [2007], the next year, is when you have these kind of silly remarks from Cedric "Cornbread" Maxwell [Cedric Maxwell] about you going back to the kitchen?  You, you think he was trying to be funny, but it backfired on him.
Speaker 2: I think so.  I think--I, I, I--personally, again, 'cause I--you know, I, I, I know--I know Cedric very well and I--you know, I, I was a little--it was a little more irritated because I just didn't think, you know, that was funny, you know, and, and--but I can honestly say that he, he recanted really, really quick and, and I--and, and even tried to get in contact with me to apologize.  But, I was so angry and, and just disgusted because I had really--I, I had worked so hard to get to where I was, I wasn't even--I--at that point, I really didn't even want his apology because I'm--I just thought to myself, I said, you know what?  You--that was just--it's just totally uncalled for and totally inappropriate, in my opinion.  So--but, I--you know, of course, hearing from other people and knowing that he actually tried to get in contact with me, you know, to apologize.  So, you know, it, it changed over, over time and, you know--but, those were, again, things that I knew that I would have to deal with and in his--in his defense, I really just thought he was being funny.  He just--it wasn't a funny joke.
Speaker 1: Now, you know, people that sit and watch games on television often say things like, oh, that referee doesn't like that particular player or they--the game is fixed.  Everybody knows it's fixed anyway, if their team loses, you know.  That's--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, what--talk about--you have anything to say about that kind of--
Speaker 2: You know, and it--I think that just goes with the tory of being--goes into the territory of being a referee (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Are, are--
Speaker 2: --and--
Speaker 1: --there animosities with players that you--
Speaker 2: Absolutely not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: To be--I mean, and I tell--I say this to people.  I said, first of all, we're not that good.  I have too many other things--too many other things to think about that's going on for me now to try to fix anything.  For me to now dislike any player, no.  Because, again, you understand that once you put the shirt on, nothing is personal.  So, any--anything that happens in the heat of the moment of the game or they say something to me that's inappropriate, you know, I--we use the tool of just giving a technical foul and it's over.  And, again, once you've given a technical foul and once you walked off that court, when the game is over, it's over.  So, it wouldn't even matter what a player had to say about me or if they didn't like something, you know, wrong or right, it really doesn't matter because that's just not the makeup that referees have, you know.  We--we're--our integrity and, and how we, we work so hard to be right and we're so critical of ourselves that those type of things never even come into my mind.
Story_ID: 663469
Speaker 1: And certain--I know certain players seem to get in more trouble than others.  I, I remember Rasheed Wallace seemed to collect more technical fouls than anybody else.  And everybody would agree he's probably one of the most skilled players to ever play.  I mean, he's big, he's tall, but he's--he could do everything.  He could dribble, pass, shoot, defend, you know.  But he would always get himself ejected (laughter) at critical times.  And do you--is there--I mean, Dennis Rodman had a tendency to go off--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --or, or Metta World Peace [Ron Artest; Metta World Peace], you know--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --had--who had a reputation--I, I only saw him that one time, I don't think he was even necessarily at--that much at fault when the guy poured the drink on him and he was laying on the table and he--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --went after the fan.  I, I kind of understood that on some level, but he seemed like he was vilified beyond what he actually did.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: 'Cause he walked away from Ben Wallace.
Speaker 2: Well, and I--and I truly believe that, that some players, they, they have that reputation and, and what's interesting about all this is that for me personally as a referee, I never had any issues with any of those players.  But, I can honestly say that, you know--and through my twenty years being in the league, that for some reason, which--and it could--I think, being a strong woman was always kind of a positive for me because what I found later is that a lot of our players in the--in the NBA [National Basketball Association] were raised by strong, single mothers, grandmothers.  So, they looked at me--and, and, and this--these are things that, that has been said to me throughout, you know, my later years in my career that they looked at me as, as that strong mother, so, never, never ever came at me in a disrespectful manner, in a sexist manner.  Players during a game, never.  I've never been called out of my name.  I've even had players--you know, they--of course, I've given tons of technical fouls, but players, after a technical foul, they come over and say, "Hey, V [HistoryMaker Violet Palmer], you know what?  I apologize, my bad," you know, or something like that.  And, and I've even had my partners go, "Hell, he ain't never apologized to me after a technical foul," you know.  But, they would actually catch themselves.  And, and so my ongoing joke was, that I would say to people, I go, let's be frank.  How difficult does, does any of you think for a woman to actually diffuse anything with a man?  It's very easy.  It's just automatic.  My presence within itself would diffuse situations, you know, because of just those, those little things that, that I just mentioned.  So, for me, I found those to be positive in, in my career to help me to diffuse, to, to establish those working relationships that would get me through tough situations during games.
Speaker 1: You know, I never thought about the players, so many of them being raised by single women, and that--it's true, I think particularly true for African American women--I mean, players, you know, LeBron James, his mother [Gloria James] was a--I mean--Dwyane Wade.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: You can go on and on.
Story_ID: 663470
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No.  And I've even--it--I mean, to even take it a step further, I've had several coaches say to me--Isiah Thomas, to be exa- I was--he was--he was the coach of the Knicks [New York Knicks] and I was standing there before the game and he told me, he says, "Violet [HistoryMaker Violet Palmer]," he said, "you know what?"  He said, "I have to tell you," he said, "my daughter [Lauren Thomas] thinks the world of you and I have to applaud you for what you have done."  He said, "Keep being the role model that you are for our young girls growing up because you have given all of them a--an opportunity and a chance to do something that has never been done."  And I, I--that--you know, it's funny, certain things I, I haven't really paid much attention to when I--that players or coaches have said to me, but to hear those type of comments is just tremendous because I never even thought that they would even feel that way.  I've had players come up to me, you know, at center court and say to me, "You know, my son or my daughter, you know, they're doing their, their, their history report on you for Black History Month that--you know what?  And, and we applaud you for, for who you have become and what you--you know, what, what you say to young, young girls and young boys, but more so," it's always young girls, "that you have given young girls an opportunity to do this non-traditional sport and to be involved in it and that you're successful.  You have no idea."  And I have to sit back some time, you know, and just marvel over, wow.  I never even--'cause that was never my intention, never even thought about it, but what a really positive thing for someone to say about you in your profession.
Speaker 2: Did, did you receive many letters when you were refereeing--
Speaker 1: All the time (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) from, from youth?
Speaker 1: No.  I mean, literally, I would--and it's funny.  The league did really well because they pretty much kept our addresses, you know, private.  But, any letter that would--that's--that a kid would mail, I mean out of the country.  It was--it--I, I used to get them from all over the place.  The, the NBA [National Basketball Association] would actually send them to me and I would be able to read them.  I've had several of our--my colleagues.  I just had one, Bill Spooner, his daughter just did her report on me and, and, and she's in high school.  And he sent it to me and let me read it and I--and I was like, wow, this is incredible.  So, you know, to have those type of things or have those--have a young girl write something and feel like that I'm a role model for her and, and just what I've done, it's just incredible.
Story_ID: 663471
Speaker 1: Now, when you look at the situation now, I think there's one--there's a--another African American woman who came in in 2015 as a referee in the NBA [National Basketball Association]?
Speaker 2: Well, no, she's not African American.
Speaker 1: She's not (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She's actually Caucasian.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Lauren Holtkamp.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay all right.
Speaker 2: And, you know, I, I--I'm so proud of that because for a lot of years, I thought that I would be the only one left and, you know, just never thought the NBA would pull the trigger on another woman, and I was so proud.  This is--she's, she's starting her second year, this year, and last year when they hired her, I think that solid- that really solidified my career in the NBA because not only that I had been successful for myself to have the years of service, my nineteen years as a--as a referee, making it to the playoffs, working an All-Star Game [NBA All-Star Game], had, had never been done.  So, I had done a lot of things for myself personally.  But, for the, the game and for the world, when the NBA hired another woman, I think that just solidified my legacy, that I've made it so comfortable and that have done such a good job that the NBA now whether you're male or female, just look at someone's talent.  And what was even nicer was they hired Lauren and it was no big deal.  You know, it was one of those where with myself and now her--them bringing her in is that they just look at who's a talented referee or not and that gender doesn't play a part in it anymore.  So, having--you know, being a part of that legacy for me personally solidified--for me personally just solidified my career.
Speaker 1: But, it's still disturbing, even since I've talked to you here, that you don't see women referees in--on the high school level hardly.  I don't--I don't know if there are any.
Speaker 2: No, not (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) College level?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: You never see--
Speaker 2: It's, it's slowly but surely changing, though, so you're slowly but surely now having women work--like, in high school, they--they're working men's basketball.  Now, in some states, it, it--they've been working it for, for a while because there's only a, a small number of referee depending upon the state and they don't really have a choice.  But, what's crazy is, on the college level, it's still totally separated.  There's no--right now, there's not any women that are working on the men's side of the NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] on any level.  So, for me to not only break that barrier in the NBA, not only breaking it to say that, hey, I was a one and done where I was able to sustain and have a successful career, now for them opening a door for my- myself now opening the door to allow another woman to get hired is phenomenal.  And even to take it a step further, football [National Football League] last year just hired their first also female umpire [Sarah Thomas].  So, again, looking, looking at my career, I can honestly say that, you know, I've had people--you know, tons of people call me and say, you know, "She's hired because of you, because you, again, worked hard, was able to do your job, that you, you, you made it just a norm and it had nothing to do with being a woman.  You just said, 'You know what?  How about just, just accept us on our ability and that our talent and that we're, we're just good referees.'"  And for me personally, that solidifies my career.
Story_ID: 663472
Speaker 1: I'd be remiss if I didn't ask you about this other thing.  This is in 2007, the same year that Cornbread [Cedric Maxwell] made his little joke, there was a NBA [National Basketball Association] sca- there was a scandal in the NBA where the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] investigated a, a referee, Tom--
Speaker 2: Tim Donaghy.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, god.  That's probably one of the--as a referee, one of the worst times of our lives because this one person literally destroyed the world of officiating by himself.  And, and I say by himself because you have to--we, we all took a hit by this one man and his decisions to do something that is the ultimate no-no or taboo.  Because if nothing else, we cannot change or take money, bribes, gamble.  All those things are taboo when, when you're talking about a referee because we are the guardians of the game.  We, we, we, we--we're, we're the integrity of the game and this one man tried to destroy that.  And the scrutiny that we had to go through and, and still today.  You know, it comes up like--of course, we--it just--it's coming up now.  But, the one, one thing that I can honestly say, being a part of those sixty individuals, that this was just one man and his own selfish greed and his own demise, and we have--we have had some struggles to, to, to get back and to--you know, we had to work to just keep people's confidence and understand that he was alone.  It had nothing to do with, with the rest of us on the staff and, you know, we went through interviews and scrutiny and, you know, they--it changed the way we could travel.  It changed that--you know, we had to stay in the same hotel.  So many things changed from him going--you know, having, having those things happen to him and it really makes me sick to my stomach even now talking about him because that's just the ultimate no-no in the career of a referee.  You know, you, you don't cheat, you don't take money, you don't--you just don't do that to the game.
Speaker 1: How do you feel about the increased scrutiny I guess with video now?  I mean, there's, there's, there's a instant replays on almost everything now.  So, if you--if you make a, a call and it's wrong or you, you know--
Speaker 2: Well--how I really feel about it, it really doesn't matter because in the NBA, we have always been under scrutiny because of just--it's the highest level of basketball.  So, personally, could really care less.  You know, we're used to every year, rules change.  Whatever the rules are, however they, they want us to officiate the game, you do what you're told by your employer.  So, now looking at--you know, now, of course, with television and, and, and instant replay and all those things, has it changed the game a little bit?  Yes, but--
Speaker 1: There's a crew in New York [New York] I think that, that reviews fouls called in the last--
Speaker 2: The last two minutes.
Speaker 1: --two minutes of the quarter.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Fourth quarter, right.
Speaker 2: As a referee, you really--you know, you know all those things exist, but you really in the back of your mind, you don't pay it much attention because it really--it--someone else is doing that.  So, you--you know, you--we have too many things to focus on in games.  Our players are so talented.  We have to now, you know, make split to second--split second decisions and our objective is to just get as many plays right as we possibly--as, as we possibly can.  Now, do we have human error?  Absolutely.  You know, and we've even found that you can go over that replay and not be able to see what we can see in a split second, you know.  At the blink of an eye, we have to make decisions.  So, understanding all those things, you just know that replay is just a--is another tool that they brought into our game that we now have to deal with and, you know, that's okay.  Does--are, are we that--are--you know, does it make a big difference to us?  Not really.  Does it take--make for good conversation?  Probably it does, you know.
Story_ID: 663473
Speaker 1: Now you've--you started a, a basketball--a, a camp for referees, right?  In (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I have, yes.
Speaker 1: --in 2001 first, right, I guess?
Speaker 2: I did.  Two thousand one [2001], I started a referee school and I pretty much started it because I just thought it was my way to give back and to, to teach.  And it was--it's for men and women--it's not just for women, and to give them--you know, I thought to myself, having the training and--that I've received from the NBA [National Basketball Association] and the success that I have and, what good is it to have all this success and all this training and keep it all to yourself?  It--there--it was almost kind of a giveback for me, a pay it forward in a sense, and that was really my initial reason for starting my, my referee school.  Has been extremely successful.  And, again, even with the whole referee school, I've not only now become an NBA referee, it's taken on probably another I guess--I can say job, another position 'cause I'm actually a coordinator of officials for the Pac 12 [Pacific 12 Conference], the West Coast Conference, and the Western Athletic Conference, and in those, I'm still training, teaching, developing, assigning games, you know, on a supervisorial level, which, again, being able now to teach referees and judge and, and help them better their careers on, on the--on the college side.  So, for me, I think my career has gone full circle.  And even taking on this new position in the NBA as a referee of--of a manager of development and performance, I now am doing the same thing.  I think the, the one tough thing for me, you know, even deciding whether or not I wanted to do it--first, I have to say that, you know, I, I, I wanted to thank the NBA because obviously the success that I have and the type of person that I had become, that I am and that--the work ethic that I have, for them to now want to bring me on, on the management side to now train and develop my NBA colleagues, that says a lot from my employer.  So, for me, having that--you know, I think I've just had a full transition from being a, a referee now to being a mentor and now to being a manager, and--you know, 'cause not everyone--you know, they always say, just because you actually are a good--that you were a good basketball player doesn't necessarily mean that you can teach, you know, or that you can coach.  So, for me, I think I'm--I was--I'm being--I'm pretty blessed and I'm probably being a little modest because if someone else was sitting here, they would say that, you know what?  You're, you're an excellent teacher of officiating.  But, I really, really enjoy it.  I really, really love watching the success of my staff.  I'm really looking forward to helping to, to develop my NBA colleagues as far as getting better in their careers.  You know, and that was a tough decision for me because coming off the floor--you know, I'm, I'm a true referee and now being put in a management position, now you're, you're in a management position where you could possibly, you know, have something to do with whether or not someone is successful or not in their career.  So, you know, understanding all of those things, but really being up for the challenge and, and knowing that I could help and develop is something that now I'm--I'm really looking forward to.

Speaker 1: In 2014, you became the first woman to officiate an NBA All-Star Game, right?  Or, or a--an All-Star game in any sport, actually.
Speaker 2: Right.  I, I think I've had a first in all--in--kind of in officiating (laughter) in, in probably every aspect.  First, to get hired to work in the NBA [National Basketball Association], first to work a--an NBA game, first to ever work the playoffs, and now first to ever work a All-Star Game.  So, you know, that was an incredible experience because, again, you're, you're on the court with the best of the best and just to have that opportunity, it was an extremely fun game to, to referee.  I was exhausted because they just get up and down.  Oh my god.  It's, it's almost like a glorified pickup game because they're just--they're having fun and they're just running up and down and I'm like, whoa, but, had such a wonderful time.  I was able to bring my family and, and they did the autographs and brought my family down on the court to--you know, to, to, to, to be there to see all the, the introductions because you're--you know, that's a time where you're actually able to kind of enjoy the game and, and enjoy all the, the, the stuff around it, and to be a part of that was, you know, I can honestly say incredible.  So, probably one of--I can say that that was probably one of the funnest games that I've ever had to work in the NBA.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 663475
Speaker 1: Now, now, you retired in 2015?  Was it 20- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I--literally--
Speaker 1: Just retired--
Speaker 2: --I just retired.  It's been a month and--10/10 was literally when I took--I just retired this last month and 10/10 was--October 10th, 2016, is--was my official date as a manager for performance and, and development for the NBA [National Basketball Association].  So, I, I am really getting my feet wet with my new position 'cause what's today?  November 17th?  So, literally a month and several days, I've been now a referee manager.
Speaker 1: So, it kind of corresponded with the beginning of the new season, NBA season.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's exactly what it did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, do you have a, a favorite player?
Speaker 2: I do not, no.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: I have--I don't think any--
Speaker 1: Or a favorite team or?
Speaker 2: I don't think any referee has favorite players.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have favorite cities.  And, again, being raised in Los Angeles [California], for me, my favorite city is New York [New York], the mecca of basketball, of course, Chicago [Illinois].  I love Los Angeles, obviously.  I love Los Angeles because, of course, it being my home--my home city and I was able to always be at home when you're refereeing, you know in Los Angeles.  And Chicago, you know.  I love the big cities.  I'm not a, a huge fan of when it's real cold in the windy city of Chicago, but I love being in the big cities.  So, for me, those would be my favorite places that I really enjoy working just because, you know, they, they remind me of home, not with the weather, I should say, but just being in the big cities because I was raised in big cities.
Speaker 1: And you actually get recognized, too, and--where a lot of--
Speaker 2: You know, I've--
Speaker 1: --refs don't.  You, you get recognized in, in airports and--
Speaker 2: I do.  I do.  I--and I didn't really realize until, you know, it's--it was--it caught me by surprise a lot of times 'cause I would be walking through airports or I could be sitting at restaurants or, you know, walking through the mall or--you know, and, and, and people would come up and go, "You're that lady."  And it was funny 'cause they--maybe if they couldn't remember my name, they--I, I was known as that lady.  "You're that lady in the NBA."  And I go, "Yeah, I'm the referee in the N- that's--," you know, and they would go, "That's the--and I knew that was you."  So, again, you know, not trying to, but I think being a woman in, in a sport that is known throughout the world, one of the favorite sports throughout the world, I'm pretty known, yes, in the--in the--and especially in the officiating world.  In the officiating world, I'm really known, yes.

Speaker 1: Now, in 2014, you were married and you became the first openly gay referee in NBA [National Basketball Association] history, right?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) And here's another first (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And another first--
Speaker 2: I know.
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: Yes.  I--
Speaker 1: Be- being a referee that every--that, that people knew and, and--did that make this easier?  And if it had--or, or, or harder?
Speaker 2: You know, I'm not sure.  I don't--to be honest with you, I don't know if it made it harder or easier.  I think for me personally, I really didn't care I think because I had solidified my career and I, I had--I knew that I had done my job and that I was good at what I was doing.  I just felt like, you know what?  There's no more secrets.  There's no--you know, I--it just kind of happened that way.  You know, I had been--Tanya [Tanya Stine] and I had been together for twenty years at the time and decided to get married once it had passed through, you know, the federal government.  So, I just felt like, you know what?  Why not do it on--it was--it's--we had been together twenty years, so, so why not get married?  So for me personally, I didn't see any, any--it wasn't for anything other than I found someone that, you know, I had been with and that I love dearly and just thought, you know what?  It's time.
Story_ID: 663477
Speaker 1: In 2015, ESPN aired a documentary called 'Queen Vee.'  Now, I haven't seen it yet, but--
Speaker 2: You must (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) I know about it now, so I need to see it.
Speaker 2: You do.  You have to see it.  It was incredible.  A great story and it kind of--you know, in a--in a--in a--in a quick ver- no, no, I wouldn't even say quick version because it, it started from, you know, the day in life as a referee and kind of went through my travels, kind of--they met my family, went, went--we did some shooting at my mom's [Gussie Palmer] house, we did some shooting here, did some shooting with my trainer and showed the adversity of, of what my body has kind of gone through over the years and showed a little day in life with--I love my--I have my two dogs, show the day in life with my wife [Tanya Stine].  So, it kind of told a story of everything.  And to be honest, again, there has never been a '30 for 30' done on a referee, so I have another first.  You know, it just seems like I, I, I tend to have a lot of those in my career.  But, I have to honestly say that Melissa Johnson was my producer and was--we have a great story and I'll say it real quick.  Her and I--I had, had a torn rotator cuff and I was literally going to physical therapy every day and for literally about six months, her and I laid on the table across from each other with the same PT [physical therapist], Chris Gerona [Christopher Gerona], and we would say hello, chit chat for a minute until finally one day, I, I come in and she said--she said to me, she said, "I cannot believe that I have been laying next to, for the last five or six months, [HistoryMaker] Violet Palmer, the NBA [National Basketball Association] referee."  And so, of course, her and I get--we start talking and she ends up telling me she was a producer and that she produced Steve Nash's '30 for 30' [sic.] and that, you know what?  There has to be--there needs to be a story on me, would I be interested?  And for some reason, I just felt really comfortable with her.  'Cause I've had other people approach me about doing something as far as television, but they never really--I never was really comfortable, of course.  But, meeting her, I was just from our--probably our general conversation sitting there where she was getting some work done on her knees and me having work done on my shoulder.  Wet met at Starbucks literally right around the corner from my house and we came up with a treatment, she pitched it to ESPN, they grabbed it.  And I can honestly say we--she just was--they were--she was phenomenal and, and it was a, a great story, told very well, and something I'm extremely proud of.
Speaker 1: Yeah, '30 for 30,' I have a lot of respect for that series and--yeah, it seems to me, these days there are a lot of really thoughtful things done with sports that show--I mean, sports are just sports on a level, but they're not.  They're more than that.
Speaker 2: They, they are.  And I think the one--the one good thing about the '30 for 30' is because they talk about your, your life at home, they talk about the adversity, they talk about the things, the struggles you had making it to wherever--whatever, whatever it might be because I think for, for people on the outside, they just see the glory of it, but they don't understand that there is so much work in--and adversity and struggles and, and things that you have to go through to get you to, you know, those points in your life where you are.  And I mean even for me, you know, I never even--I had someone talk to me a month or two ago and, and he said, "You know, that you--did you have these aspirations to be this, this, you know, barrier breaker and to be the first?"  And, and I said, no, because that was never one of my reasons for doing it.  I was doing it because I thought I was good enough, I was given an opportunity, and I had worked hard.  So, for me, it was about the work.  It had nothing to do with any of those firsts 'cause we just kind of went through a lot of firsts, you know, and I--I'm very proud of them.  I'm, I'm, I'm happy to talk about them, but that had nothing to do with why I got into or why I have been successful in, in my career as an official.  So, it's just--I think those were just the fortunate things that have happened for me, but they really have nothing to do with why I started.
Story_ID: 663478
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there anything major that you would do differently if you could do it over again?
Speaker 2: Absolutely not.  I have done--you know, I'm--I've been really extremely blessed in my career and probably--there's probably only one that I could say that I would do maybe if I--if hindsight I could go back.  And, and I've only learned this because when you're in the NBA [National Basketball Association], your, your, your body is really beat up, and I think when you're young and you start out, you just think or you just know that your body is gonna last forever, and, and it's not.  And especially for me being a woman, and even now, I tell women in officiating that you have to--when you're young and, and starting out and you become extremely successful, you have to take care of your body.  And I think for me personally, you know--and not saying that, that I didn't take care of it, but I--but I think I could've did some things better, like I could've stretched more, I could've iced more.  But when you're young, you think that you can--you know, you--you're superwoman.  You, you can do this forever.  So, for me personally, I probably would have, you know, taken care of my knees probably a little different in which I, I think I've done a lot of things right in it, but just hindsight, probably would've did, did some things differently.  Because, you know, I was--I was such a referee, I would referee every summer, in the summer--in the summer, you know, the Drew League or the Summer Pro League here in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and probably looking back on it, probably should've took a couple of those summers off because that wear and tear--
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause that could be--I mean, a referee could end up refereeing--did you ever have days where you refereed more than one game?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Absolutely not.  One--that's one thing that I didn't do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, I think I could've given my body just a little more rest in the summertime.
Speaker 1: So, how many would you typically, you know, be able to do in a, a week?
Speaker 2: What?  For NBA or, or in the summertime?
Speaker 1: Well, no, let's go back to when you were--yeah, doing college games.  How, how--
Speaker 2: Oh, doing college games, you could work every day.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  See, that's--there, there--see, that's the difference between--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --college games and NBA.  When you're a college referee, you could work, you know, five--six days a week if you wanted to during the basketball season.
Speaker 1: But the toll of that, though.
Speaker 2: The toll of that--
Speaker 1: 'Cause you're running forty minutes.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) game, you're running down.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  And then, of course--now, once you get in the NBA, the games are longer, players are more talented.  You--your, your body--and, and then you have to now deal with all the travel, the carrying the bag, the, the airplanes, the sitting in airports, the weather issues, the, the, the hotels.  I mean, so you--so, there's so many more variables that you now have to realize that you have to do more things to take care of your body because that's your livelihood.  So, not--and, again, I could've did all those things right and still only had a twenty year career.  Who knows?  Hindsight.  But, I'm just sitting here--when you asking me the question, I would--that's the only thing that I can honestly say that in my younger days when, you know, I felt like I was Superwoman, I probably would've taken a little more time off to just do those maintenance things to let my body recover.  Because, again, when you're young, you just--you think that you're invincible.
Speaker 1: And I think you told me off camera that you injured--actually injured your knee playing softball.
Speaker 2: That was one of my injuries.  I've, I've, I've had several, but that was one.  And that was--again, that was before my career actually kicked off, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Thinking again about everything you've done to this point in life, what today would you consider to be your major accomplishment?
Speaker 2: Wow.  What today would be my major accomplishment?  I think my major accomplishment is that I've done so well in the man's world that any woman now can have an opportunity and just be judged on her work and not her gender.
Story_ID: 663479
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Wow.  This, this generation we have right now, it's a little different from when I was raised.  I think the Afro American community has to understand our--even our, our kids, they have to understand that they have to get as much education as they possibly can and that they have to know that getting out, working in, in Corporate America, that you really have to just work hard.  I think they--there--our generation now has been given so, so many things and it's--things just become real easy for them versus when I was growing up, it was about work, you know, survival.  And I think our, our kids now have to understand that you have to work to be successful and to educate yourself, to get as much education as you possibly can to be successful because nothing is just gonna be given to you.  And I think because they've had it a little easier, that they sometimes think that.  They think that, you know what?  I don't--I don't have to be as good.  But, for being an Afro American, you have to be better and you have to understand that you have to be better.  You can't--you know, you, you can't look at it like, oh, woe is me and why, why me and not--you know, not them?  For me personally, I always knew that I had to be two times better.  I had to be two times better because I was a woman, because I was an Afro American, and that didn't matter to me.  It never discouraged me.  It just really made me work harder.  So, I would say for our kids today, that's something that they just have to know that that's something that they're just gonna have to deal with to be successful.
Story_ID: 663480
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, now, you're still fairly young.  You're not (laughter)--you're not decrepit or anything, so--
Speaker 2: Not yet anyway (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, so, what do you plan to do next?
Speaker 2: I plan to--wow.  As soon as I'm--I'm extremely busy now.  I plan to keep doing what I'm doing.  And what's great is that because this doesn't--this is--what I'm doing now doesn't take any physical pressure for my knees as far as I don't have to run to do what I'm doing.  I just have to, of course, be good at my computer and, and go, you know, observe a lot of basketball games, that I can do this until I feel like it.  So, as long as I enjoy it, I feel like that I'm helping, you know, referees get better, I'll keep doing it.  When I think I get to a point where they're not listening to me anymore or I'm not--I don't feel like I'm, I'm making, you know, my staff better, then I may look at it and, and decide to do something different.  But, I can honestly say, I'll probably do this for a while.  Because, again, I'm, I'm someone who--I'm able--the job that I have, I love doing it, so it's really not work for me.  So, I can say that I'll probably do it for as long as I want.
Story_ID: 663481
Speaker 1: Is there any--I should've asked this earlier, but is there any innovation or any rule change that you would recommend after being a referee for so long in the NBA [National Basketball Association]?
Speaker 2: Right now, no.  I think our game in the NBA is at its best.  You know, I think they've, they've done a really good job to open up the game to showcase how talented our NBA players are.  They've done it even in college the same--that's why the college have taken on some of the NBA rules because, you know, the game is so free flowing and it's fun to watch, and it allows for those best players in the world to do what they do.  So, looking at our game right now, you know, and as, as players are getting better, I, I really don't see there--that there's anything that needs to change.  It is really at a level at, at its best where people really enjoy watching it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there anything I haven't asked you about?
Speaker 2: God, no.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: You have ask- Tanya [Palmer's wife, Tanya Stine]--I told--I said, this is the longest interview.  No, this is incredible.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry for I'm laughing.
Speaker 2: No.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  You, you have--you have hit--you've hit some things that I don't think I've ever even thought about before, which is--well, I mean, which is--I think is a great thing.  So, for me personally, this is--it's been--you've taken me kind of through a journey of my life, not only my career as officiating, but just my life itself, which is kind of nice.  So--
Story_ID: 663482
Speaker 1: Okay.  So yeah--and you talked about how your mother [Gussie Palmer] felt about what you were doing, that you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --actually found, found your--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --place.  Last two questions we ask are similar but a little bit different from each other, so I'm gonna ask them together.  What today would you consider to be your legacy and how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Wow.  My legacy is that I have created, in officiating--or I have allowed in officiating for--I have broken that barrier that a woman is not judged on her gender, she's judged on her work ethic and can do anything a--and has shown that she can do anything a man can do if given the opportunity.  And I don't know if I can--those are kind of--they--the legacy 'cause what--you said legacy and--
Speaker 1: How you'd like to be remembered.
Speaker 2: How I would like to be remembered.  I think it goes without saying.  I will be remembered in history as a barrier breaker.  I have so many--I have quite a few firsts that we've discussed throughout this interview, but I think just--wow.  I want to be remembered as someone who was given an opportunity and just kicked the door down and never looked back, and has been very grateful for that opportunity.
