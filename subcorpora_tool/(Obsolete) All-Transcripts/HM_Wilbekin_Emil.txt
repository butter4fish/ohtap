Story_ID: 156470
Speaker 1: What is your favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I have many favorite sayings and phrases, you know.  One of them is stay in your lane, which means that you concentrate on what you do well, and let people do what they do really well; you know, I thought about this so much--what would be my favorite phrase.  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Sorry.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think it's really, you know, be--be the best that you can be; be your best self, be present and always do your best.
Story_ID: 156471
Speaker 1: I wanna talk about your early years and--starting with your family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: What's your father's name?
Speaker 2: Harvey.
Speaker 1: Harvey Wilbekin?
Speaker 2: Harvey Earl Wilbekin.
Speaker 1: And tell me about your dad.
Speaker 2: So my dad was a very incredible man, and I would say was very influential in shaping the man that I've become.  My father was the youngest of thirteen from St. Croix and the [U.S.] Virgin Islands.  He studied at Hampton University [formerly Hampton Institute, Hampton, Virginia]; he studied architecture and then moved to New York [New York].  His--several of his brothers and sisters didn't go to college so that he could go, so for my family, work ethic was always very, very important.  Integrity was so important for my father.  He later became a lawyer, and in fact I have a photo of his law school graduation when he's holding me where I'm age five.  And my father always worked really hard, took care of his family, but he always made sure that he spent time with his family and so, you know, I worked at my father's law office when I was age twelve, and it was a great way for me to spend time with my father but also to see a black man at work.  And so he had a very profound effect on me professionally and really encouraged me to do my best, work really hard, but also to follow my heart and do what I love.
Speaker 1: And what was his birth order of thirteen?
Speaker 2: He was the youngest.
Speaker 1: The youngest.  And did he go to school in St. Croix?
Speaker 2: He went to--yes, he went to elementary school in St. Croix, and then went to Hampton, then Institute, in Virginia for undergrad, then he came to New York and went to Brooklyn Polytechnic [Institute of New York University, New York, New York] for engineering, and then went to law school in Cincinnati [Ohio].
Speaker 1: And you said a number of his siblings did not go to school so that he could; did they stay in St. Croix?
Speaker 2: They did; they stayed in St. Croix.  The sister right above him, her name was Beryl [ph.] Wilbekin; she stayed and ended up taking care of my grandmother until her death at about age one hundred.  But they all had agreed that it was more important for my father to go to college at that time, and so that was the decision that was made, and he went to Hampton, and it's become a family tradition; so my brother went to Hampton, I went to Hampton, and then ironically, my mother's [Cleota Proctor Wilbekin] sister went to Hampton as well as her husband, and then my father's uncle was in the ROTC [Reserve Officer Training Corps] at Hampton.
Story_ID: 156472
Speaker 1: Where does the name Wilbekin come from?
Speaker 2: So Wilbekin is Danish West Indian and, you know, it's Wilbekin in Denmark, but it's what it says, it's Wil-be-kin, it's phonetic, so we will be relations, we will be family.  And so that's the history of the name.
Speaker 1: So is your father's--can you trace your father's family back to the Dane?
Speaker 2: Yes, we can--yes.
Speaker 1: Do you know that family history?  How far back can you go with your father's family?
Speaker 2: You know, I know mostly what my parents [Harvey Wilbekin and Cleota Proctor Wilbekin] kind of taught me growing up.  It's all, you know, I don't know it as well as I should but, you know, the Danish settled in St. Croix and it was part of the Danish Empire, and then later the English Empire, and then it became part of America.  So we were raised with a lot of Danish influence, a lot of European influence mixed with West Indian influence.
Speaker 1: What part of St. Croix [U.S. Virgin Islands] did they live in, Christiansted [St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands] or Frederiksted [St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands]?
Speaker 2: My family is from Christiansted, St. Croix.
Speaker 1: And do you--have you visited?  When you were a child, did you go to visit there?
Speaker 2: Yes, we used to go to St. Croix every Christmas, and it was so interesting growing up in Cincinnati, Ohio because we would actually go, you know, right at Christmas or Christmas Eve and then we would stay through Three Kings.  And, you know, growing up in Cincinnati, people were like, "Well, why is he away for so long?"  But it was very important as part of our West Indian tradition; it was Carnival at that time in St. Croix.  We spent a lotta time with our family; we have a family house in Christiansted, and it was the one time of the year that that was what we did; we were part of our West Indian culture, we spent our time there with our family, and it's one of the most wonderful parts of my childhood because I left very kind of conservative Cincinnati in the Midwest to then go to, you know, this tropical island where everyone knew me, I had family, the family name there is very, you know, well-known, and I could have fun and swim in the ocean and be on the beach and hear steel drums and see Carnival and eat all these amazing foods.  So it was a very, very important part of my upbringing.
Speaker 1: You mentioned Three Kings days; what is your family religion?
Speaker 2: My family from St. Croix is Lutheran.
Speaker 1: And what did your father's family do?  What was their work in St. Croix?
Speaker 2: My grandfather Jeremiah [Wilbekin] worked for the telephone company, and so my father used to always tell me these stories how they had telephones on the island before everyone else because my grandfather worked for the telephone company.
Speaker 1: And did your grandmother [Elizabeth Wilbekin] work?
Speaker 2: No, my grandmother was a homemaker with--you know, being the mom of thirteen children, she's a little busy (laughter).
Story_ID: 156473
Speaker 1: And what about your mom; what's your mom's name?
Speaker 2: So my mom is Dr. Cleota Proctor Wilbekin.  She is from Des Moines, Iowa and she now lives in Cincinnati [Ohio] and is retired.
Speaker 1: And tell me about her growing up.
Speaker 2: So my mother's family--you know, they migrated from the South to the Midwest, so a lot of our family is from--or lives in Kewanee, Illinois; and then my grandparents [Julia and Stanley Proctor]--my grandmother was born in Alabama, and then my grandfather was born in Des Moines, and so they settled in Des Moines, Iowa, raised a family--my mother had a sister Imagene [ph.], and they were very kind of middle-class at a time where there wasn't a large black middle-class in this country; so very, very great values, family values, very--a part of the community.  My mother's family is A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal], and so my grandmother was a homemaker but she taught Sunday school, she was very involved in the church, you know; she worked with the Girl Scouts and many, many civic organizations; it was very important for her to give back to the community.
Speaker 1: What was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: My grandmother's name was Julia Proctor.
Speaker 1: And they moved from--her family or your grandmother's family moved from Alabama?
Speaker 2: To Kewanee, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Was that during the Great Migration?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you know what prompted them to move?
Speaker 2: I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know what her parents did for a living?
Speaker 2: I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your mom is a doctor; doctor of--
Speaker 2: My mother is a doctorate of sociology; she also has her J.D. [degree].
Speaker 1: When you were growing up, was your mother in school or she was already finished?
Speaker 2: Growing up, my mother was--she did her Ph.D. when I was growing up; she was pregnant with my brother when she was in law school.  I have a brother, Erik John Wilbekin, who is six years older than me.  So she--yes, so she was working on her Ph.D. while I was growing up, and then she worked as an administrative law judge for the State of Ohio.
Speaker 1: And this was in what time period that she was an administrative law judge?
Speaker 2: In the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: So was she a first?
Speaker 2: Yes, she--and I--we have to check this but she, I believe, is one of the first African American women to pass the bar in the State of Ohio.
Story_ID: 156474
Speaker 1: You're from Cleveland [Ohio]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you were born in Cleveland, but you grew up in Cincinnati [Ohio].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How did that move happen from Cleveland to Cincinnati?
Speaker 2: So I was born in Cleveland, and then my parents [Harvey Wilbekin and Cleota Proctor Wilbekin] adopted me when I was six months old.  My parents had twins--my brother was a twin; the other twin died at birth, and when they knew they were gonna have twins, they chose family names, so it was Erik and Emil.
Speaker 1: Wow.  Do you know anything about your birth family?
Speaker 2: I know bits and pieces about my birth family.  My mother was sixteen years old when she was pregnant with me and had me; she was a twin, she was Hungarian.  My father was African American, worked in a factory and was older than my mother, so as you can imagine in 1967, a lotta challenges around having a, you know, black baby to a mixed race couple where the man is older, and so my mother, birth mother, decided you know, to give me up for adoption because she wanted me to have a better life than she could provide for me.  So for that, I've always been grateful because I have this extraordinary life that I may not have had.
Speaker 1: When did you--when were you told that you were adopted?
Speaker 2: My parents told me that I was adopted when I was six years old.  They were very transparent about everything and explained it to me, and of course being the inquisitive mind that I have, I ask a lot of questions.  "So does that mean our blood's not the same?  Does that--you know, we've been eating the same foods, aren't we now the same?"  And they explained to me that we were not the same in the that way, but they explained to me that I was very special and, you know, as the story goes, I went to school the next day and was on the playground and announcing to everybody that I was special and that I was adopted and that I was different, and I really appreciated that and thrived on that.
Speaker 1: Did you ever have the desire to find your birth family?
Speaker 2: I've reached out to the adoption agency.  The files are locked, which was very common at that--in the late '60s [1960s].  One day I'm gonna do the search to find my birth parents because I think it's important just to know exactly where I came from, but I have a lot of trepidation with that because my mother and I are very, very close and I just don't wanna be disrespectful to her and what she's given to me, but we talk about it constantly.
Speaker 1: Is your--your mother--so your mother's still living; is your father still living?
Speaker 2: I believe they're still living; I'm not sure--
Speaker 1: --No, sorry--
Speaker 2: --Oh, sorry, my adoptive--
Speaker 1: --The Wilbekins--
Speaker 2: --Yes, my mother's still living, my father passed away in 1997.
Story_ID: 156475
Speaker 1: What would you say is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: I think my earliest memory of growing up is being, you know, with my family; we--you know, we travel.  So every Christmas, we go to St. Croix [U.S. Virgin Islands] together as a family, and then every Thanksgiving, we would drive from Cincinnati [Ohio] to Des Moines, Iowa.  So my memories are always kind of with my family--being together.  There was always a lot of creativity in our household, a lot of music.  My mother [Cleota Proctor Wilbekin] is a, is a pianist and so she plays the piano, she played the organ at church.
Story_ID: 156476
Speaker 1: She [Wilbekin's mother, Cleota Proctor Wilbekin] was kind of a child prodigy at a very young age.  She graduated from high school at age sixteen.  She studied music at Drake University in Des Moines [Iowa].  She was on a tennis team at a time where most of the tennis team was all white.  She told me this very funny story about how she was sick with the flu and so I guess at that time they had to call all the other families to tell them that she was gonna be out for a period of time, and it shocked most of the people because no one knew that she was black; they just knew that there was this woman at--you know, this young girl at school named Cleota and she was very popular with all the students.  The parents had no idea that Cleota was black.
Speaker 2: How did they find out?
Speaker 1: I guess when they called, they kind of said, "Oh, it's Julia and Stanley Proctor's daughter," and that's when it kind of made this connection.
Speaker 2: And what happened as a result of that?  Did the relationship shift at all?
Speaker 1: No, everything was still the same; everybody--you know, I think it was just kind of a shock like, "Oh, Cleota's black."  But she sent me this really great photo where she's on a tennis team and it's just very striking because it's this black and white photo and she is in her tennis whites with these other white young teenage girls and, you know, it's something that we would take for granted today, but back then I'm sure was, was a big deal.
Story_ID: 156477
Speaker 1: You mention that she [Wilbekin's mother, Cleota Proctor Wilbekin] and her family were middle class at a time when there weren't many African American families that were middle class.  What did her parents do?  What, what allowed them to be in that place?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother's family was also--had a very good work ethic; I think family and being, you know very steeped in the church and the community, and kind of being very upright.  Anyone that knew my grandmother [Julia Proctor] from Des Moines [Iowa] will always say that she was always about your manners and your P's and Q's and being a gentleman or being a lady.  She's very quick to correct people from their English to the way they behaved and so I think that there was just something in them that they didn't wanna be like everyone else; they strove to be, you know, successful and to be kind of pillars of the community.
Story_ID: 156478
Speaker 1: I want you to go back to where you grew up in Cincinnati [Ohio]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and what street did you live on?
Speaker 2: I grew up at 6142 Hedge Avenue, which is in Kennedy Heights in Cincinnati, which is a black kind of suburb of the City of Cincinnati.
Speaker 1: And can you describe the block?  What did it look like?
Speaker 2: So it's very interesting.  We grew up in a very traditional kind of middle class kind of suburban neighborhood, except my father [Harvey Wilbekin] was an architectural engineer, so he designed and he and my mother [Cleota Proctor Wilbekin] built our house.  So in the middle of this very kind of normal suburban neighborhood was this very super-modern redwood angular house with an indoor swimming pool.  And that was kind of a big deal because my father worked for the city so we had to live in the city limits, and so a lotta tension was always, you know, given to us in our home because it really was something that was quite extraordinary in the late '70s [1970s], I mean late '60s [1960s] and early '70s [1970s] to have a very, very modern designed home with like big glass plate windows in the front; everyone knew we had this swimming pool, and then my father being from St. Croix [U.S. Virgin Islands] and then my mother being from Des Moines [Iowa] and us not being natives of Cincinnati, we were always kind of considered different.  But in that, our house was very popular; my parents always had pool parties for kids in the neighborhood.  My mother entertained all the time so we always had open houses and people over, so it was really, really fun.  I mean it was kind of like your storybook childhood growing up in Middle America.
Story_ID: 156479
Speaker 1: Your parents [Harvey Wilbekin and Cleota Proctor Wilbekin] were from two different places.  What made them settle in Cincinnati [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: So my parents met and married in New York City [New York].  My mother was at Barnard Teachers College [later, Barnard College of Columbia University, New York, New York] and my father was at Brooklyn Polytechnic [Institute of New York University, New York, New York] getting his engineering degree and a--mutual friends, a couple, introduced them to go on a blind date.  And I guess my mother was having problems kind of meeting a guy in New York City (laughter), which I guess still persists, and they went on this date and my mother liked my father immediately but she was unsure that my father liked her, and then she didn't hear from him so she told her friends, she said, "Oh, I don't think he likes me," and they were like, "No, he actually likes you, he's just shy."  And they went out and I believe shortly thereafter, he asked my mother to marry him.  And so it was very funny as my mother retells the story because my mother's side of the family, being from Des Moines [Iowa], was like, "Oh, she's gonna marry this foreigner."  But St. Croix [U.S. Virgin Islands] is part of the U.S. [United States] territory.  So they met--I mean they married in Des Moines, and then they lived in Bed-Stuy [Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, New York, New York] when they lived here in New York.  And then as they thought about what their lives would be and how they would raise a family, they decided to move out of New York because it's just so expensive to live in New York and raise kids, so my father did a job search; he considered a job in Denver [Colorado] and a job in Cincinnati with the city, and took the job in Cincinnati, and they moved and they tell the story that--you know, my brother [Erik Wilbekin] was born the first year they moved to Cincinnati, they built a house, and they took a trip to Europe, and they would not have been able to--and they bought a car, and that is something that they would not have been able to do living in New York.  So my parents miss New York and love New York very much, but we were always raised with a very New York sensibility in Cincinnati, which was yet another thing that made us kind of stand out in the community because my mother is super glamorous and--you know, she wears big glasses and she has, you know, she's very, very glamorous and, and fashionable.  And then my father being from St. Croix was, you know, black, but there was a certain swag and, and difference that he had being from the [U.S.] Virgin Islands, so all of these things together we were always kind of considered different.  And in fact, in high school, everyone called us the Huxtables--of course.
Story_ID: 156480
Speaker 1: When you were growing up--I want you to remember what sights, sounds, and smells remind you of your, your early years.
Speaker 2: Hmm.  That's a great question.  I would say, you know, green grass and, you know, fresh air and kind of the sound of wind in the trees reminds me of Cincinnati [Ohio].  Cincinnati has its own kind of legacy of, of certain types of foods so Coney Islands, which are hot dogs with onions and chili and cheese, but it's--the chili has cinnamon in it so it tastes very different.  There's great--Graeter's Ice Cream in Cincinnati.  I really--when I think of my childhood, I think--it's very kind of Norman Rockwell, like it's very--I just remember playing in the streets with my friends, playing baseball, riding our bikes around neighborhoods.  Everyone in our neighborhood was very close so neighbors were always watching you; someone was always watching you, so it felt very safe.  But for the most part, you know, I went to an integrated elementary school but my neighborhood was black, our church was black, a lot of my parents' [Harvey Wilbekin and Cleota Proctor Wilbekin] friends and their professional and social groups were black, so it was a very kind of happy black childhood sprinkled in with this West Indian culture, so my parents were very, very involved in the Caribe West Indies Organization in Cincinnati, so we would often go to these folk festivals that they had at the Cincinnati Convention Center where they'd have cultures from all over the world.  So I always kind of grew up around more than what was in front of me.
Story_ID: 156481
Speaker 1: What kind of music did you listen to as a child?
Speaker 2: So music in our house was very interesting because my mother [Cleota Proctor Wilbekin] really likes calypso music so she played calypso music a lot, but when she was cleaning the house on the weekends, she would play a lot of gospel music, so James Cleveland, specifically, was played a lot.  My brother [Erik Wilbekin] was very into music so the Jackson Five--hugely popular; he also liked rock and roll, so--I mean even pre-rock and roll--the Osmonds--I mean there was just always constantly music in our house.  And because my mother played--was the organist for our church, my brother and I were in the choir--and my father [Harvey Wilbekin]; there was always music, and lots of different types of music.  My mother also likes classical music so--oh, and she also likes country-western so there's also memories of, you know, going from James Cleveland to going to like Johnny Cash because she loved the show 'Hee Haw,' and--but music was constantly playing.  And there was--my mother would have to practice for church so she would be practicing piano and singing, and so the kids in the neighborhood would tease me 'cause they could hear my mother practicing and singing.  And then my brother and I took music lessons; my brother took piano and flute and guitar, and I took piano.  And I really wanted to play well, but I just wasn't any good at it and my brother actually was really talented and wouldn't play, so--
Speaker 1: Were you a good singer?
Speaker 2: Singing, I was good, and as I got older, the base in my voice was great for the choir so I was in the choir in grammar school, and in the choir at church.
Story_ID: 156482
Speaker 1: Going back to your neighborhood where you grew up,
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: You described your home--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Please describe what the rest of the neighborhood looked like.
Speaker 2: So the rest of the neighborhood that I grew up in was very kind of ranch-style homes; everyone had a front yard and a backyard, it was very immaculately groomed.  You know, most people had dogs and it was just--it was like a really beautiful, happy place.  Cincinnati [Ohio] is a very, very conservative city and typically, African Americans live in kind of enclaves, so this neighborhood, Kennedy Heights [Cincinnati, Ohio]--you know, it, it was fine for me to go off with my friends when I was old enough and go to playgrounds and walk through the neighborhood, and I remember being so happy that when I finally got to go to Mister Foster's, which was basically the local delicatessen in our neighborhood and be able to go and use my allowance to go buy barbeque potato chips and, you know, Barq's Root Beer.  But it was always safe--like it felt very, very safe as I was growing up.  I went to elementary school; I walked back and forth to school.
Speaker 1: How far away was the school?
Speaker 2: It was about a mile--and other kids that went to my school like--you know, you'd walk and then they'd leave, and then you'd keep walking and then I was kind of at the end.  But it was really, really great.  I had a paper route when I was nine years old because I wanted to make money (laughter), and my parents [Harvey Wilbekin and Cleota Proctor Wilbekin] were like, "then you have to work," and so that was another way.  Like people--everyone kind of knew me in the neighborhood and I knew everyone, and it was just this really lovely picture book, story book kind of existence.
Speaker 1: Was your neighborhood one that was developed at the point of desegregation when people were able to move into so-called nicer neighborhood, or was it always, for a long time, a black neighborhood?
Speaker 2: My neighborhood was, I believe, part of desegregation where people were moving, you know, out from the center and moving, you know, further into the suburbs.  There were some professionals in our neighborhood, but I would say that most of the people in our neighborhood were working class or middle class, so--I remember the woman, Mrs. Roper [ph.], who babysat us; like her husband worked at a factory and she had foster kids and she babysat all the kids in the neighborhood, so we all kind of congregated around Mrs. Roper's house.  So the one thing that I always appreciate about my parents was that there was never anything about class; it was always about people, and so you--no matter if your best friend didn't have as much as you had, you treated him the same way; you never--it was never about I'm special, or my parents are professionals.  It was, that's fine.  And the way that my mother really instilled that with us is that as a social worker, she would have to go into projects and low-income housing to meet with families, and she would often take my brother [Erik Wilbekin] and I with her and we would play with the kids, and we didn't think anything about it; it was like, "Oh, okay, we have to go to work with mom.  This is great; we get to spend time with our mother."  And we played with the kids while she was doing case studies with the clients, so I'm grateful for that.
Story_ID: 156483
Speaker 1: Beyond your family, was there ever any conflict that you experienced between the conservative nature of Cincinnati [Ohio] and homogenous black people and then the West Indian element?
Speaker 2: There wasn't any real conflict between kind of the African American culture and the Caribbean culture.  Because my parents [Harvey Wilbekin and Cleota Proctor Wilbekin] were part of this Caribe West Indian society, it just seemed kind of this cool extension of my existence.  You know, people made fun of me at school if I wore a dashiki or, you know, it was like, "Oh, I--you know, went to St. Croix [U.S. Virgin Islands]," and they were like, "Really?  What's St. Croix?"  And then I'm explaining it.  But there was never really any culture clash.  Like it just--for me, it was--it almost was like being Afrocentric, like the West Indian part and the Caribbean part was like the Afrocentric part; like that was our real African roots.  And also, I think, you know, with St. Croix and the [U.S.] Virgin Islands, what I found is that the cultures and the values that both sides of my family had were very similar, so they were both very much about family, they were both very much about going to church, they were both about kind of not--no drinking, no smoking, and being part of the community and working really, really hard and becoming successful. So everything just kind of made sense to me, even though I got that it was different, and I got that it was, you know, wild outfits and--and great music with steel pans [drums] and things like that; it just kind of made sense to me.
Speaker 1: Did your father have a West Indian accent?
Speaker 2: My father, at this time, did not have a West Indian accent.  In fact, my mother would probably speak with accent more than my father but that's my mother's personality; she's very kind of dramatic and over the top.
Story_ID: 156484
Speaker 1: Your brother's [Erik Wilbekin] six years older than you.  Were you all ever in school together?
Speaker 2: My brother and I were not in school together.  I went to the same elementary school that he went to so I kind of had the lay of the land.  We shared a room together when I was a baby because he wanted me to share the room with him, and I remember being so happy when I got my own room just because I would have my own things.  But then it was most interesting when--I think I was twelve and he went to college, because then suddenly I was an only child.  And so that's when things--I think we became closer during that time because that's when he really stepped into the role, to me, of being a big brother because he would go away and as he came back and I'm going through puberty and, my teenage years, was very, very helpful in helping me navigate my self-identity through that time and, and has had that role in my life since that time.

Speaker 1: Where did you go to junior high school?
Speaker 2: So I went to Our Redeemer Lutheran School [Cincinnati, Ohio] which is a private Lutheran school; so I went there from kindergarten to sixth grade, and then grad-- kind of, I guess, graduated, and then went to Walnut Hills High School [Cincinnati, Ohio] which is a public college-prep school, so you have to take a test to get in.  And this was interesting for me because we kind of figured out later that I had a learning disability with some problem with reading and problems with spelling, and then some challenges with math but, you know, my parents [Harvey Wilbekin and Cleota Proctor Wilbekin] just thought I was being kind of targeted when I was in elementary school.  And then I remember taking the test to go to Walnut Hills and I didn't pass the first time and so I had to take it again.  And I remember, growing up, that my parents would--when we were riding in a car, I would have to read out loud because they were like, "We want to get you up to speed."  And then they were really amazing because they got a math tutor and a English tutor for me who were both women, who taught in the public schools, who lived in our neighborhood so I could walk to their houses and, and I would go see them once a week and do different exercises and things like that.
Story_ID: 156486
Speaker 1: Socially, as you were growing up--and you mentioned that your brother [Erik Wilbekin] kinda helped you with your identity.  Describe your social life and, and what you mean by that.
Speaker 2: Well, I was always very kind of popular in school; there people liked me a lot.  You know, I have a very affable personality and I like being around people so--I liked people, but I did always feel this sense of being different; you know, being in elementary school [Our Redeemer Lutheran School, Cincinnati, Ohio] and public school [Walnut Hills High School, Cincinnati, Ohio] where I was in the minority; being adopted, being mulatto, being in the black community, having parents [Harvey Wilbekin and Cleota Proctor Wilbekin], you know--father from St. Croix [U.S. Virgin Islands] and mother from Des Moines [Iowa].  As I was younger, those--those were the things that stood out as different; as I would get older, I would later realize, Oh, I'm also gay, so then that was another layer of being different.
Speaker 1: When did you realize that you were gay?
Speaker 2: I think growing up, I knew I was different, but I didn't know what it was.  I remember that my godmother gave me this book about becoming a man, and it talked about puberty and all these different things--how your body changes, how, you know, certain scents change in a man's body, how your genitalia changes, and all these different things; and then there was this section that I fixated on that said, "It's not uncommon for teenage boys to feel attracted to other men, but usually it'll pass."  So in my mind, this was just part of puberty and I figured it would pass, but it never really passed.  So I didn't really--I think in college is when I realized, Okay, I'm different and I don't know what this means, and it's kind of terrifying to me.  And then--I remember having a lot of internal dialogue of how I was gonna negotiate this growing up, and so it was very, very terrifying; and then when I went--after college graduation from Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia], I went to study at Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts].  I studied British media and advertising in London [England], and I remember taking Ralph Ellison's 'Invisible Man;' and so I'm reading it and I have--so I'm just graduated from this all-black college and I have two Jewish roommates and two Asian roommates and I'm just like--and I'm in London and I'm like, "Okay, what is going on right now?"  And one day I was reading an issue of Time Out London, and there was a photo of two black men that was very kind of seductive, and it was a teaser for a film called 'Looking For Langston,' by the director Isaac Julien.  And I went to go see the movie by myself; I snuck away from my school group and went to go see this movie and it was like, "Eureka!  I'm gay!"  And then suddenly I started to see more men holding hands walking down the streets of London or in South Kensington Park, and I kinda knew that that was my truth and I had to own my truth, which was kind of a very scary proposition for someone who's, you know, middle-class from Cincinnati, Ohio with very, you know--families with very strict val-- family values, religious values who were professionals and very in the community and in society, and so it's something that I kinda had to work through and luckily, when I came to New York [New York] to go to Columbia [University] Graduate School of Journalism [New York, New York], that is when I kinda found myself and found my way and kinda came to terms with, "Yes, I'm a gay man and I have to own that."
Story_ID: 156487
Speaker 1: I wanna talk about that, but I wanna go back for a minute--
Speaker 2: --Okay. Okay.
Speaker 1: When you were at--when you went to Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia]--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --can you describe what it was like to be at Hampton--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --and what the social life was like there?
Speaker 2: So I loved growing up in Cincinnati [Ohio], but Cincinnati felt small to me; it was very conservative.  I didn't, I didn't think my life was in Cincinnati so I was so thrilled to graduate from college--I mean from high school [Walnut Hills High School, Cincinnati, Ohio]; I was thrilled to graduate from high school and then be able to go away to college, so I didn't have a choice of where I was gonna go.  My parents [Harvey Wilbekin and Cleota Proctor Wilbekin] said, "You can go wherever you want; your tuition will be paid at Hampton."  So I remember my parents--now, I had visited Hampton before because my brother [Erik Wilbekin] went there, my father went there, my aunts and uncles had gone there; so when I got there, I was like, "Okay, this place is beautiful."  It shocked me, being in the South, that everyone would greet me and say "Hello," and I remember saying to my parents when they took me to school, I said, "Why is everyone saying hello?"  And they were like, "Well, this is what you do, and this is a black college and this is a community and people are from the south and from all over, and so this is what you're gonna learn while you're here."  So it was fantastic; I loved it, I met all new friends.  My roommate my freshman year was Skip Dillard who is the head of programming at WBLS [WBLS/WILB New York] now, and he, I remember, had turntables in our room.  It was just awesome because I finally felt like, okay, I'm away, and I can really become who I really am and who I really wanna be.  So I have great, great memories of Hampton and being on the Chesapeake Bay and clam bakes and going to step shows and being surrounded by beautiful black people who all had dreams and aspirations to change the world; it was amazing.
Speaker 1: What were your dreams and aspirations?
Speaker 2: So my dreams and aspirations when I went to Hampton--I'll take you back to Cincinnati first.  In my bedroom, there was a mural on my wall that I created that basically I would take--my parents were ferocious readers so they had subscriptions to Ebony, to Jet, Time, People, they got the local newspapers.  I had been reading GQ Magazine since I was twelve years old and Vogue probably since around the same time, and then Interview magazine and Paper magazine, and what I would do--Details, not Paper--I would tear out images of black people that were glamorous, that were photojournalistic, and I made this huge mural on my whole bedroom wall because I knew that I wanted to create something; something different, something new, something exciting.  I wanted to see myself and black people in a different way, and so I knew I wanted to do that.  My big kinda challenge with myself and with my parents was that--my parents were both lawyers, my brother was gonna go to law school; I did not wanna be a lawyer, I wanted to be an artist or be a fashion designer, and my parents were like, supportive of that, but they also wanted me to do something that was more practical and so they encouraged me to try to figure out a way to marry my love for art and photography and fashion with something else more practical.  So senior year in high school--I was very, very good at--in my speech class, and my teacher suggested mass media arts.  And so then there was this idea of like, oh, I could do media and then combine fashion, photography, graphic design, art--all these things into that field.  So that's why I studied mass media arts at Hampton, and my dream at the time was that by the time I was thirty, I wanted to be a millionaire, I wanted to have my own magazine, and at that time, I wanted to live in Paris [France] for at least three years.
Story_ID: 156488
Speaker 1: What di-- what did you participate in while you were at Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia]?  Were there any fraternities?  Any other organizations?
Speaker 2: I--when I was at Hampton, I was--I did not pledge, which was a bit of a controversy because my father [Harvey Wilbekin] was a Kappa [Alpha Psi Fraternity] and he was--so I was legacy; he was, I believe, on the second Kappa line at Hampton, but I just refused to do it.  I went to an interest meeting, I didn't like it, I didn't have a lotta respect for the Kappas who were in that chapter at that time because, from my perspective, I'm on the Dean's list, you guys are kind of C-students, and it just--it didn't feel right so I didn't do it.  I was a student leader on campus, I was also the editor of the Hampton Script, newspaper, and so those were my real big interests and so that's what I did.  I was in the choir for, I think, one year.
Speaker 1: Something that I forgot to ask you from a little bit earlier.  As a child--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --I read that you were in Jack and Jill [of America, Inc.].
Speaker 2: Ahh, yes.
Speaker 1: Would you describe that?
Speaker 2: Yes.  So my mother [Cleota Proctor Wilbekin] is super-duper social and was--and probably still is, and about thirty civic and social organizations--so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Such as?
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: Such as?
Speaker 2: Oh, so she is--you know, she's an AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority], she's a Link [The Links, Inc.], she works at a soup kitchen, she's part of the Women's Quilters of Colors Network [sic, Women of Color Quilters Network], the--she is a historian for the National Bar Association; I could go on and on and on.  So as a child, we were always encouraged to do kind of social things so I was a Cub Scout growing up, I was in Little League, then I was in Jack and Jill and became president of my chapter, I was also in Top Teens which was part of Top Ladies of Distinction, and I kind of loved Jack and Jill because--I didn't love--I don't know, something felt separatist about Jack and Jill, but my best friend Holly Poole [ph.] was--who went to high school [Walnut Hills High School, Cincinnati, Ohio] with me and our parents were friends, we were kind of the anti-Jack and Jill, Jack and Jill kids, so we took over the organization; I became the president and she was like the treasurer, so that we would make it more cool and more fun.  But what I really loved about Jack and Jill was that I got to go to the regional conferences, and when I would go to the regional conferences, I met all these people from St. Louis [Missouri], from Detroit [Michigan], from Chicago [Illinois]; and so that was really, really cool 'cause I was meeting all these people from other places.  The other thing that was great was that every summer we went to the Black Lawyers' Convention, so a lot of my friends from the Black Lawyers' Convention were in Jack and Jill so I would get to see them twice in one summer, which was really, really fun.
Speaker 1: Did you see any of those people at Hampton when you--any people in Jack and Jill?
Speaker 2: There were several people from Jack and Jill from the regional chapter that I--at Hampton who I met, and then there's friends that I'm still friends with like Dennis Archer, Jr., and his father [Dennis Archer] was the mayor of Detroit.  There's people that I've worked with that I see all the time who are still part of that network Gabi--Gabrielle Glore.  There's so many people that I still see to this day that I know from Jack and Jill.
Story_ID: 156489
Speaker 1: So we're at Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] now--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and in addition to your studies--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --I'm curious if--were you in relationships at all when you were at Hampton?  Did you begin to have experiences that showed you that you were a gay man?
Speaker 2: At Hampton?  You know, I, I was like, oh, I have to date because that's part of the social scene, so I did date.  And then I started to have--I had one relationship really in, in college, and it was kind of off and on and very, you know, scary.  Ironically, the person lives in New York [New York] and is in a relationship, and we know each other really well now.  But yeah, it was--it was just kinda scary to me to be even exploring that at the time.  Now, being, you know--studying to be a journalist and, you know, I knew how to do research, so I knew, you know, about James Baldwin and I read his work and I read, you know, other people's work or--and researched things, but it was just scary--and not that we would be out--and I saw other people that I knew were gay but like we didn't acknowledge it; it wasn't--we weren't--or it wasn't open then, and I felt that I couldn't be at that point.  I think going to London [England] and then moving to New York [New York], there was almost this freedom where I could be like, okay, I can be who I really am now.  And probably at a time where it was appropriate for me to be that.
Speaker 1: Still at Hampton, was there an underground gay community there?
Speaker 2: Not--I wasn't connected to an underground community; I will say my big challenge with the Kappas [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity] was that they wanted me to prove that I was not gay, and so it was beyond terrifying to me that they would even see that and they would be actually calling me out on that; freaked me out because it was like they knew my dirty little secret, and then I just didn't even know how to negotiate that at all.
Story_ID: 156490
Speaker 1: What were your years at Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: I was there--I was at Hampton from 1985 'til 1989.
Speaker 1: [HM] E. Lynn Harris was writing at that time, wasn't he?
Speaker 2: I don't know; I wasn't--
Speaker 1: --You weren't aware of him then?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So you left Hampton and then you went to Boston [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: I went to London [England] through Boston--
Speaker 1: --Through Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts].  And you describe--you were beginning to describe this as where you came to terms with yourself.  What did you share with your parents [Harvey Wilbekin and Cleota Proctor Wilbekin]?
Speaker 2: So you know, with my parents, I did not come out to them until several years after college, so probably the early '90s [1990s].  And basically, it was--you know, integrity was such a big value that I grew up with.  I had challenges lying to my parents, basically.  So "Who are you dating?"  Like "Who's your girlfriend?"  And it just became this barrage of questions that were just very unsettling to me because I knew that I was something else, and so I also knew that it would be hard to have that conversation with them.  And I just remember--I think the straw that broke the camel's back, and this is gonna sound so funny, was that I was on the--I would call my parents every Sunday from wherever I was in the world, and I was having conversation with my mother and she said, "You know, that model Tyra Banks, she's single; why don't you try to date her?"  And I literally was like, "I can't do this anymore.  Like if you're gonna start matchmaking for me, like I can't do this."  And so I had a very, very challenging--and I had to pray really hard and I talked to a lot of people 'cause at that time I'm an assistant at Metropolitan Home magazine where there were several gay editors who kind of coached me through coming out, basically; and I can remember it like it was yesterday and, you know, I probably didn't do it the best because of my maturity level at the time, but I did it over the phone.  It didn't go over well, and I just remember my mother quoting Bible verses and screaming and crying.  But it was interesting because my father said, "I had a feeling."  And that was kind of interesting to me, so that--I mean it helped, but it was a very, very rough time, and what really got me through it was that my brother [Erik Wilbekin] said--and I told him before I told my parents, and he said, "Whatever you do, you have to make me the promise that you will educate mom and dad about what it's like to be a gay man, and what the culture is like, and that you will not forsake them."  And so I've done that; and it has not been easy, but I've done that.
Speaker 1: How old were you?
Speaker 2: I came out to my parents--I was probably like twenty-two, twenty-one, twenty-two.  Yeah, and it's, it's an ongoing journey, a conversation, but it is one that is easier now and is--you know, my mother comes to New York [New York] about twice a year for a month at a time since she's very clear that I'm an out gay man; she doesn't always wanna talk about it.  But I remember I was on--New York magazine did a power outage list; it was like the most powerful out, you know, people in New York, and I'm on the list.  And I was getting some award [Creative Spirit Award], I think, from Pratt [Institute, New York, New York] or something, and so I met her for breakfast the next morning and I took the magazine with me and I was like, "Okay, I have to show you this because it's in a magazine."  And I pulled it out and I showed her this, this list and she said, "I've already seen it."  I was like, "Okay."  So we move on and we keep goin'.
Story_ID: 156491
Speaker 1: At Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia]--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --when you were studying mass media arts--is that what it's called?  Who, who were your teachers?  Who were your great influences?
Speaker 2: My really great influence at Hampton was a professor; her name is Lottie Knight, and Lottie Knight was the hardest professor I had had to date in my career--she was not the last.  And Lottie Knight was--I mean you had to turn in something that was spectacular; like if you did not do your best in your work, you were gonna re-do it until you got it right.  She would call you out in class, she would read your stuff in front of people in class, and she was just tough; like she didn't--she didn't care, and she was a really, really, I think, powerful influence on me because I would have to say that a part of my editing and management style would come from her, which is the--the motto at Hampton is the standard of excellence.  And so that is something that I carry with me, that is something that I reference a lot because I have had the privilege to work with a lot of other Hamptonians, and so Lottie represented--Mrs. Knight represented the standard of excellence, and she was phenomenal; she was a big influence.  The other things that I remember about Hampton was studying French, and what was unique about studying French at Hampton was that we learned French by learning about the French-speaking parts of Africa and so that was really brilliant.  The other part which is important to mention is as the editor of the school newspaper; I was very controversial because I would actually take the administration to task about student rights and things that were going on, and in fact, several times, funding for the school paper would miraculously be pulled, and I can remember having to drive to Williamsburg [Virginia], which is about forty-five minutes north of Hampton, to pick up the papers from the printer because there was no way to get them back and forth and going, and they were like, "Oh, the paper is not ready because the school didn't pay," and I was just, you know, just--and so that riled me up even more.
Story_ID: 156492
Speaker 1: What years were you editor?
Speaker 2: I was editor of the Hampton Script in 1988 and '89 [1989].  There was another professor there named, I believe, is Felicia Lee [ph.], and I'm not sure; and I remember for this--it was a magazine class, and I fell in love with this class because you had to create your own concept for a magazine, and I was like, Bingo!  And I remember creating a magazine--'cause I told you I had this fascination with Paris [France] called Noir, and it was all about black culture, black style, black fashion, black politics, and it was just like life being breathed into me, creating this prototype for this magazine.  The other thing that is so important to mention is that every summer I had an internship when I was at Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] and, you know, I was like, I don't really wanna go back to Cincinnati [Ohio] but if I had to go back to Cincinnati to have a base, like a place to live, that would be great 'cause then I could save more money.  And so the first summer, I got a newspaper internship at the Cincinnati Inquirer as basically like a gofer in the newsroom, and that was through the American Society of Newspaper Editors, and it was really wonderful because all the black reporters and editors--anybody black in photo, and the messengers--anyone that worked there who was black took an interest in me 'cause they were like, "Who's this guy?"  And several of the reporters really pushed me to look at becoming a newspaper reporter, and so subsequently, every summer, I would intern at the Cincinnati Inquirer through some organization or another through National Association of Black Journalists [NABJ], and so then I would become a reporter.  And then I remember a woman on the copy desk said--I was like, I don't like these deadlines, like going to cover a fire or a city hall meeting, and then you have to write it so fast, and it would kind of almost like throw me; like it was too much of a frenzy.  And she said, "Have you ever thought about magazines?"  And I just was like, "Whoa!  Like I could work at a magazine?"  And she's like, "Yeah, you could work at a magazine."  So all of these things kind of came together, and so I thought, magazines.
Story_ID: 156493
Speaker 1: And then when I was about to graduate [from Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia], I was thinking, I have to get to New York [New York] by hook or by crook like that, and that had been my dream, and something I was very vocal about since I was a teenager, that I wanted to live in New York.  I would say to my parents [Harvey Wilbekin and Cleota Proctor Wilbekin], "I don't know why you moved to Cincinnati [Ohio]; like New York is where it's at."  So in preparing to graduate from college, I applied to magazines and I applied to graduate schools, so I applied to NYU [New York University, New York, New York] for American studies, I applied to Columbia [University Graduate School of] Journalism School [New York, New York], I think I also applied to Northwestern [University, Medill School of Journalism, Evanston, Illinois] just as a backup, even though it wasn't New York; and then I applied to magazines.  I applied at Rolling Stone, Conde Nast--I met this guy named Nollie Moses [ph.] who worked at Newsweek so I applied at Newsweek, and then I met this woman at a Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] Communications fair named [HM] Monique Greenwood who worked at Fairchild [Publications], and so I applied at Fairchild, and I remember writing a letter to Alexander Liberman at Conde Nast saying how the Kerner Commission Report, it was like some seminal anniversary, and how there was still not parity in the newsrooms or magazine offices for African American people, and I was his answer.  And he wrote back and said, "I'm gonna introduce you to the HR [human resources] Department and you will come in and interview."  And I interviewed at Newsweek and I interviewed at Fairchild with Ed Nardoza, and I interviewed at Rolling Stone and Fairchild was about to hire me, Newsweek was about to make an offer, and I got a letter of being accepted to Columbia Journalism School.  And that--my mother was like, "You're going to Columbia.  Like I don't care about the other stuff, you're gonna go to Columbia."  So that was how I ended up at Columbia J [Journalism] School.
Story_ID: 156494
Speaker 1: What did you say to those job offers when they came?
Speaker 2: Well, I told everyone that I was considering other things, and then once I said I got into Columbia [University Graduate School of Journalism New York, New York], everyone was like, "You have to go to Columbia"--like everybody--my professors, the potential job people, the HR [human resources] people; everyone said, "You have to go to Columbia."
Speaker 1: When was this?
Speaker 2: This was my senior year, so 1989.
Speaker 1: How does Boston College [sic, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts] figure into this?
Speaker 2: So I didn't have anything to do for the summer and I was like, I can't go to Cincinnati [Ohio] for the summer, like I'm about to graduate, I'm coming into my own, I've been there for the last four summers, and I saw this ad on the wall in a Mass Media Arts Building that was this program that Boston University did; you could study British advertising and media, so I'm like, oh, great, I'm gonna go work at like British Vogue or the Face, or ID, and you get to live in London [England].  And so my parents [Harvey Wilbekin and Cleota Proctor Wilbekin] said, "Yes," 'cause they were like, "This is good, you've never been abroad."  And so they sent me off to London and I had no idea what to expect, and I learned all these things about British media and advertising, which is--that's one of the places where it is--I mean they do kind of cutting-edge innovative advertising and media.  I did not get an internship at Vogue, ID or the Face; I was at a magazine called Company, which is a women's service book, and I was an intern in the beauty department, and that is where I learned how to produce photo shoots because, little did I know as an intern, I had to do everything; I had to book the studios, book the models, book the stylists, pick the hair and makeup, book the food--everything; and then I wasn't allowed to go to the photo shoot because someone had to answer the phones.  And I just remember being devastated the first time I was told that, and I never got to go on a photo shoot, but I learned all--everything you needed to know about putting a photo shoot together.
Speaker 1: This was an internship?  Is that--
Speaker 2: --Yes.
Speaker 1: And how was the internship structured?  Was it paid, unpaid?  I mean how were you--what got you--
Speaker 2: So you--basically, you know, it was--you applied, you got in, there was some fee attached; they would place you at a magazine; so you studied British media and advertising for the first half of the summer, and then the second half you would go intern.  And that was also great because then I was in Europe so I got to travel all around England, I got to go to Paris [France], I got to go to Ireland, and so it was kind of like I was becoming who I always wanted to be, which was this kind of, you know, James Baldwin-esque (laughter) person who would travel the world and influence media and culture.
Speaker 1: And what year was this?
Speaker 2: That was 1989; that was the summer.
Speaker 1: And where were you living?  Can you describe your environment?
Speaker 2: So London--I mean, so we lived in South Kensington, which is very posh; there was a building that they had, so they had different flats and everyone had, you know, up to five roommates.  But I met other people from Boston University, from George Washington [University, Washington, D.C], from the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], from all these different schools, and--yeah, we would go to Kensington Park, I'd go to High Street Kensington, Piccadilly Circus; I worked in Piccadilly Circus, so it was this really kind of wonderful entree to prepare me for moving to New York City [New York] because at this point, I had lived in Cincinnati, I had gone to Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia], spent a lotta time in [Washington] D.C. because that was like, you know, the closest fun place to go to from Hampton.  And then I lived in London for the summer, and then I came home for about a week, and then came to New York to go to Columbia.
Speaker 1: Now you say that in London [England] was where you really came into yourself in a particular--discovering your sexuality.
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Describe that scene.
Speaker 2: Well, at this--at this point in my life, I was a little bit more edgy, you know, I'm very young, I just graduated from college, I used to have hair down to my shoulders that I wore in a ponytail, and this was like the Batman rave summer, so there was, you know--Soul II Soul was really big so it was kind of this Afrocentric Euro movement, George Michael was really big; there was just all this stuff going on, and everything, you know, as a eighteen year-old, everything seemed amazing to me.  So I think it was coming into my own, growing up, maturing, becoming, in my mind, more worldly, but also kind of being a little bit away from my parents and their conservative ideals, glamorous as they were, and really kind of finding myself.  And so when I moved to New York, I mean it was my dream come true, so it was, it was a time in London, I think, to prepare for that.
Story_ID: 156495
Speaker 1: Then you come to Columbia [University Graduate School of Journalism, New York, New York] in what year?
Speaker 2: So, in 1989, and I graduated in '90 [1990]; it's a one-year, nine-month, very, very, very intense program.
Speaker 1: And you're in New York City [New York] on the Upper West Side.
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: This is now a new location for you.  What was New York City like?
Speaker 2: New York City for me, when I moved here, was great.  And then this is when I pull from my Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] network so I had all these friends who were from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut that lived in New York or nearby, so they kind of showed me the ropes.  You know, my big reveal was that I had been in London for the summer and I was gay, and they were like, "Finally, you know that you're gay 'cause you've been gay."  And I was like, "Oh, okay."  But it was exciting; and the great thing about the Columbia program is that they send you to every single part of the city.  You have to learn the history of New York.  You learn every neighborhood, every borough, you know the history of it, where it was settled from the Dutch to where Spanish immigrants went, where black people lived, where--you learn all of this and--so it was a really great kind of immersion into New York City.  It was also really, really intense and I think for me, the best part of it was--I was scared, I was like--I'm coming from Hampton, how am I gonna be at this big Ivy League school; it's the best journalism school in the country, and I did fine.  And I was prepared and I thank Lottie Knight for being so hard on me.  And I was the only person in my class of about three hundred that was interested in magazines; everybody else was interested in newspapers or they were interested in being on television.  So my professors took a very keen interest in me--two professors in particular; one was Samuel G. Freedman who was a culture and arts reporter for the New York Times, who decided that I should start writing about hip-hop because there was this emerging kind of underground music scene and, and happening, and he said, "I think you should write about that."  Also because he knew I had friends in New York who would take me to these parties; so we'd go to [Kool DJ] Red Alert's birthday party at the Red Parrot, and I would go to a Heavy D party and--so he's like, "You're doing all these things, why don't you think about writing about hip-hop?"  So he was extremely influential and actually helped me--connected me to people to actually write for the [New York] Times right when I graduated from Columbia, which was amazing.  The other person was my magazine writing professor whose name is Martha Nelson; and Martha, at the time, was the editor of Savvy Woman magazine and would eventually become the first woman who's the editor-in-chief of Time Inc. and the founder of InStyle magazine.  But Martha was really great because she would give me books to read about fashion and fashion reporting, she would take me to meet with her at Society Woman so I could see what it was like, and she really, really helped me develop my ideals of--that I could be a magazine editor someday.
Speaker 1: Did you have a sense of who these people were, these instructors, in the context of publishing?
Speaker 2: I didn't really--I mean I knew this woman is, you know, Martha Nelson is the editor of Savvy Woman, so obviously she's important.  Samuel G. Freedman, I was like, oh, I know he wrote a book about a black church in Brooklyn [New York, New York], I've seen his byline in the New York Times.  I don't know; it just--it was like this is my episode (laughter) and this is what's happening; I didn't--I don't know, it was interesting.  There was another professor, and I wasn't in her class but I would always make sure that I talked to her, and her name was [HM] Audrey Edwards.  So I really--my mother [Cleota Proctor Wilbekin] has this thing about me; she's like, "You always end up in the right place at the right time," and that is--I think it kinda holds to be true, like my life kind of unfolds in this way where, you know, I think of the Oprah [Winfrey] quote that she borrowed from someone about, you know, being prepared and opportunity meeting, and that's, you know, the moment of success; and for some reason, I've been very fortunate in that way.

Speaker 1: When you graduated from Columbia [University Graduate School of Journalism, New York, New York], what happened next?
Speaker 2: So, graduate from Columbia, I wanna work at a magazine, I'm like, I'm ready, I've done my year at Columbia, I've studied in London [England], let's go.  And I applied to all these different magazines and I got a call from Metropolitan Home magazine which was then owned by Meredith [Corporation], and it was really exciting to me because they had this really dynamic editor named Dorothy Kalins, and they had just won a National Magazine Award, and I thought, I wanna work there.  It's also interesting because my father [Harvey Wilbekin] was an architectural engineer, my mother's [Cleota Proctor Wilbekin] from Des Moines [Iowa]; Meredith was based out of Des Moines.  So Dorothy was traveling and couldn't meet me and she made it a point to interview everybody, no matter what level you worked at the magazine.  But everyone said, "You have to hire this guy," and so they did.  And the managing editor was Charla Lawhon, who would later become the editor of InStyle magazine, and I remember--like I'm working at my desk, I'm assisting--so I'm the editorial assistant for the articles department.  So I'm assisting Barbara Groustark who, I believe, is an editor now at the [New York] Times, and then I had to support four other editors.  So I'm answering phones, I'm doing contracts, I'm faxing, I'm running errands, research--you name it; and I'm loving it; I'm, I'm doing it, like I'm living my dream.  And I remember one day I'm at the desk, on the computer, answering phones, and this woman walks by and it's Dorothy.  And so she stops and she goes, "So you're the great Emil Wilbekin that everyone said I had to hire without meeting."  And I was like, "Here I am."  And it was awesome and it was, you know, interesting to me because it was my first real job out of college in New York [New York], and it was where I kind of learned that you have these family-like experiences in your work space and, again, it was also the place that I kind of came out because we were on a sales trip--like the whole staff; this is when magazines had tons of money, and we were all going to Acapulco [Mexico] for a sales conference, and several gay editors from staff came over to me and they said, "Are you gay?  Like what's the deal?"  And I was horrified, and I was like, "Well, yeah."  And they were like, "Well, how come you're not out?"  And I was like, "Well, I am; I feel like I'm out.  I didn't know I was allowed to be out at work."  And they were like, "Well, you're a whole person, you're not kind of this, you know, categorized person; you're a whole person and yes, you're allowed to be out."  And those guys kind of helped guide me.  Neal Turner--Newell Turner was the fashion editor there, and I remember he took me to my first fashion show, and it was this Ron--Ronaldus Shamask show where Linda Evangelista had dyed her hair bleach blond for the first time, and it was like standing ovation; I didn't understand what was going on.  But Newell was very, very helpful in coaching me to come out in my life, to myself, and then to the world at large.
Story_ID: 156497
Speaker 1: Where were you living?  What was your home environment like at this time?
Speaker 2: So when I was at Columbia [University Graduate School of Journalism, New York, New York], I lived at 113th [Street] and Broadway, like in a--just like a big tenement building.  My first apartment after Columbia when I was working at Metropolitan Home was on 34th [Street] and 9th [Avenue].  It was a one-bedroom; I was sharing it with a friend that went to Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] that was from Hempstead, Long Island [New York].  I lived in the living room, he lived in the bedroom, I had some, you know, petite curtain blocking off the living room, so we had like a little dining area that was the living room, and it was awesome, like I met friends.  I met a young black editor who worked at Vanity Fair named Ricky Lee, and so Ricky kind of introduced me to the publishing world.  And so then I became friends with Jonathan Van Meter and a lot of other editors, and we all hung out together.
Speaker 1: Where was Jonathan Van Meter--can you paint the picture of who these people are--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and where they were?
Speaker 2: So Ricky Lee was an assistant at Vanity Fair Magazine, and then Jonathan Van Meter was at 7 Days; he was kinda this hot up-and-coming editor and writer, and there was just a whole group of us that they--we used to have this thing that was like--I think first Thursday of the month or last Thursday of the month where we would meet at a bar and we would all come together, and it was great 'cause it was, you know, Alan Light--all these young journalists who had the same dreams that I had; they wanted to come to New York and take over.  And they became my circle of friends, and we'd go to parties and we'd hang out.  Now this is in New York's, you know--at the end of the era of very downtown--you know, there was so much energy and art and fashion and culture, and everybody could go, so it was just a very, very fun, exciting time, and being this assistant at Metropolitan Home bought me a certain amount of cache, and then, you know, I just--I was like, this is where I'm supposed to be--
Story_ID: 156498
Speaker 1: So while I was at Metropolitan Home, my--well, both parents' [Harvey Wilbekin and Cleota Proctor Wilbekin] work ethic would then kick in because as I'm assisting the articles director and four other editors, I was also freelance writing, so I was freelance writing for the Associated Press, I was the men's fashion reporter, and then someone connected me with the Chicago Tribune to be their style reporter, so I would--all of these were freelance.  I would contribute on the side, and then I would also free-lance for Essence at that time.  So I was in seventh heaven because I was living my dream.  I was writing, I was supporting myself, I was making extra money so I could have money to go out and to buy new clothes, and I was coming out and, you know, everything seemed great to me.
Speaker 2: And the magazine at the time was fine with your freelancing with all of those different publications?
Speaker 1: The magazine loved me freelancing because it also put me out there more, so I would have to go to men's fashion shows, I would have to go to art openings and, and other things, and they loved it; they nurtured me, everyone supported me.  They were like, "Please--do this."  And they got the importance of me being this young black guy who was hungry for journalism and hungry for media and culture, and they supported that.
Story_ID: 156499
Speaker 1: Where was Metropolitan Home contextually in this space of magazines?  Was this when they were on the ascent?  Were they already big?  Where were they at that time?
Speaker 2: This was when Metropolitan Home was really on the ascent; they were--this was almost like near the top, so this is National Magazine Award, super flush, competing against the other shelter magazines like Elle Decor.  H.G. [Home & Garden] had just started, House Beautiful--so we were doing really well, and it was--again, the edgier of the home magazines.  They did a big partnership with DIFFA, the Design Industry Fights AIDS [sic, Design Industries Foundation Fighting AIDS], and so they would do the Love Ball, so I would get to, you know, volunteer to work at this event and meet Kenny Scharf and Sandra Bernhard and all these people--Calvin Klein would be there, so I was in those rooms.  And Dorothy Kalins' big thing, which really I carry with me to this day, is how do you bring social consciousness to your journalistic work?  How do you make a difference in the community, or in the world, so be it gay issues, environmental issues--what are you doing to kind of really push yourself?  So it's not just glamorous photos and pictures, but how are you really making a difference in the community?  And so they did a show house that would benefit DIFFA, and that was really, really important to me, as my career would go on, about how to give back and how to make a difference in the world, not just to create beautiful pictures and, and compelling stories.
Story_ID: 156500
Speaker 1: You were talking about DIFFA [Design Industries Foundations Fighting AIDS].  See your first exposure to DIFFA was through Metropolitan Home [magazine].  When and how did you become involved with DIFFA?
Speaker 2: So Dorothy Kalins' mantra was not only do we cover stories about social issues, but you get involved with the social issues.  So I would volunteer at the DIFFA Show House, I would volunteer to work at the Love Ball, and it was just something that was very, very important.  What I hadn't anticipated was, several years into the future, being the editor-in-chief of Vibe [magazine] and being asked to join the DIFFA board, and I believe how it happened was that I went to a Dining by Design event, and someone from DIFFA asked me, they said, "Oh, wow, would you consider joining the board?"  Because they didn't have anyone of color at all, and I told them my history of DIFFA and that I had done work with them before; and I said, "Yes," and David Rockwell was the president of the board at that time, and it was, you know, a really great experience.  I think it was, in many ways, for everyone involved in this opportunity because I was so young, I was so immersed in being the editor-in-chief of Vibe at that time that I don't think that I was ready to give the way that I could give now that I'm older.
Story_ID: 156501
Speaker 1: Now, you were at Metropolitan Home [magazine] for how long?
Speaker 2: I was at Metropolitan Home for two years.
Speaker 1: And then what happened?
Speaker 2: So at that time, the Roxy, which is this big night club, it's really big, and this is where Naomi Campbell and Christy Turlington show up in Afro wigs; I mean there were just all these--and they were swinging on a swing that was in the club and--club life was really big in New York [New York] at that time, and it's where fashion, art, culture--everything came together.  So hanging out with Jonathan Van Meter and all our other friends who worked at magazines, we would joke around about if we had our own magazine what it would be like.  And one day, Jonathan calls me at work to say that because of the Time Warner merger, the Warner Brothers side was looking at ways that they could partner with Time Inc. to develop an editorial property that could promote music and entertainment, basically, so they partnered with [HM] Quincy Jones, and Quincy wanted to do this magazine that would take R&B music mostly, because this is the very, very beginning of hip-hop, and show the artists as rock stars the way Rolling Stone did; so that was kind of the general direction.  So then we would meet at Jonathan's loft apartment downtown--
Speaker 1: --Excuse me; how did Jonathan get involved in this Quincy--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Time Warner--
Speaker 2: So Jonathan had been identified by Time Warner and someone that they kind of went after, like he should be the editor of this magazine because he knows pop culture because he knows music, he knows fashion, he knows all these things.  And Jonathan proposed to the people at Time Warner and Time Inc. that he had a circle of friends who all worked in different facets of publishing who he could bring together to staff the magazine, and they said, "Well, as long as they're all qualified, absolutely."  So I call my parents [Harvey Wilbekin and Cleota Proctor Wilbekin] and I'm like, "I'm quitting my job at Metropolitan Home," and my mother was like, "What are you doing?"  And they were like, "Well, what are you doing?"  I was like, "Well, there's this new magazine that's gonna be started by Time Inc., Time Publishing Ventures with Warner Brothers," and she's like, "I don't think this is a good idea."  And I was like, "No, this is my dream; like, this is what I've always wanted to do."  And then when I said, "Quincy Jones is gonna be the founder," then she's like, "Oh, okay."  So at that point, I quit my job to go work on a test issue, which was all that was guaranteed, of this magazine that at the time didn't have a name.  We were assigned an editor from Time Inc., named Gil Rogan, to work with us, and so then added new to the mix were--we had this circle of friends and then Scott Poulson-Bryant was brought on as, I think, senior writer or senior editor; Joan Morgan was brought on as an editor, and Kevin Powell.  And so--
Speaker 1: And the other people?
Speaker 2: So the other people were--it was--what is Diane's last name?  Oh, Diane Cardwell, Jonathan Van Meter, Ricky Lee--oh, and another new character, [HM] Michaela Angela Davis.  So, it was kinda this like new, exciting, Bohemian arts radical moment in publishing where all these really young talented people from different backgrounds were coming together to pool their resources and their creativity to create this brand new magazine.
Story_ID: 156502
Speaker 1: And it [creating the test issue of Vibe] was super exciting because the music was changing; you know, Whitney Houston was becoming popular, hip-hop was really bubbling under; there was just all-- so much excitement going on, and we would meet and we created this test issue of this magazine that was initially called Volume, until one day I was reading Billboard and I was like, "Oh, there's a British Volume, you guys, and it's a magazine that comes with a CD and then Time Inc. Legal researched, and they're very kind of risk adverse," so they said, "You have to change the name."  And literally, while we were going to press, we changed the name to a name that Scott Poulson-Bryant came up with which was called Vibe.  [HM] Quincy [Jones] loved the name; Treach was--Treach from Naughty By Nature was on the cover, and we had created this incredible like cultural shifting piece of journalism.  I mean Naomi Campbell was in the fashion story, LL Cool J was featured, and it was big and bold and in your face, and I mean it was incredible; it was an incredible time.
Speaker 2: What year was Vibe founded?
Speaker 1: So this is 1992 when we did the test issue, and then what Time Inc. does and did at the time is that they would test it, so they launched this issue; they wanted to see how it would perform on the newsstand.  They did market research with consumers, there seemed to be an appetite for it so then, almost a year later, it was launched.  And in between that time, Gil Rogan from Time Inc. was particularly taken with me, and he said, "Would you wanna work at People magazine as a reporter researcher?"  And I said, "Sure, it's People magazine."  So I went and I worked at People magazine and I kind of was their influence to, you know, urban culture--some hip-hop, R&B, black celebrities.  I remember one big story that I worked on was Eddie Murphy's wedding, and I had to call a numerologist about the numbers, and do all this reporting, and it was very, very fun but, you know, they didn't know who TLC was at that time; they didn't know who any of these charac--who's Queen Latifah?  They didn't know who any of these people were who would later become household names, but this was very early on.  And I remember that we finally got the green light to start the magazine, and I went to tell my boss that I was gonna leave, and she said, "You know, you don't have to leave; you could have a very, very bright career here at People."  And I said, "I'm so grateful and I appreciate it, but I have to go back to, to finish my work at Vibe."
Story_ID: 156503
Speaker 1: So at Vibe I was an associate editor and I basically was the editor initially of the front of the book section, and then I did back of the book columns, and then as we moved on, I became the new talent editor for a section that was called Next, and that was a very pivotal time for me; I didn't know it, but I was basically writing about and, and editing stories about artists who would later become cover-worthy artists.  And I was also working with publicists who were just out of school and starting out just like I was just starting out, so this would really become the foundation for my career in terms--as it relates to celebrities.  And for the test issue, Joan Morgan was supposed to interview this young woman that I brought to the table.  I was delivered a cassette tape and I fell in love with this woman's voice immediately, and it was Mary J. Blige.  And Joan, for some reason, couldn't do the story and so it was assigned to me, and then that would start my long-standing relationship and love affair with Mary J. Blige.
Speaker 2: Who were some of the other people that you wrote about in Next?
Speaker 1: So in the Next section, some of the artists that we've covered were Maxwell before he had a record deal, Aaliyah, Brandy, Missy Elliott, OutKast; I mean it was pretty much a who's who of what would become hip-hop and urban music--Usher.  I remember meeting Usher when he was sixteen years old.  So it was, it was, it was a really, really exciting time and exciting to grow with these artists.
Speaker 2: What was Usher like as a sixteen year-old?
Speaker 1: Usher at sixteen was pretty much like Usher is now, like he was very kind of precocious.  I mean he was very well-behaved, but he always carried himself like he was a star and a superstar and--yeah he's--and I, I appreciate Usher because I've been on flights with Usher and he will tell the stewardess, "Tell that man over there to shut his window 'cause the light is bothering me," and then I'll look over and it's him, and he's laughing.  You know, he's, he's a very, very cool guy.
Speaker 2: Mary--did you meet Mary at the beginning of her career?
Speaker 1: So I met Mary at a lunch with Andre Harrell and Scott Poulson-Bryant, and Mary was there, and she was just raw--that's the only way I could even describe her; like beautiful, introverted, quiet, barely spoke; she had this fiery red hair.  And I kept talking to her 'cause I was like, it's weird, 'cause she's not talking.  So I kept talking to her, talking to her.  And she would finally open up and then when I got the chance to do the interview with her, we did it in my office at Volume-slash-Vibe, and I asked her about her grandmother, and her grandmother had just passed away.  And Mary burst out into tears and I was like, I don't know what to do right now; I have no idea how to console her.  Because at that point, I was like, so, like I'm a journalist, there's this wall and I remember digging in my drawer and pulling out these like napkins from a deli and giving them to her, and that's how we really connected, and she always remembers that.  And so when Vibe launched and her 'My Life' album was coming out, I campaigned to write that cover.  I had never written a cover story, but I just knew that my relationship with her and how much I loved her music, that I could get something that no one else would get, and so that was my first cover story.  I got to fly to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] with her and spend like several days in L.A., and then at the photoshoot, it was really cool because there was this makeup artist there, named Sam Fine, who was doing her makeup, and it was just this incredible moment of people coming together.
Story_ID: 156504
Speaker 1: [HM] Quincy Jones was the founder of Vibe.  How much interaction did you have with him?  What was your relationship like with him?
Speaker 2: Well, in the beginning of my time at Vibe, I didn't interact that much with Quincy; like I remember meeting him for the first time at our launch party.  He would come in, but I was--you know, I was an associate editor; I wasn't senior enough to kind of be in closed door meetings with him.  My relationship with Quincy really developed when I became fashion director.
Speaker 1: When was that?
Speaker 2: So that was 1997.  And what was interesting about me really meeting Quincy--this is gonna be hard.  So, I was the associate editor at Vibe and then I became the style editor.  My parents [Harvey Wilbekin and Cleota Proctor Wilbekin] were in St. Croix [U.S. Virgin Islands] for an extended time, and they were coming home the next day, and I decided to call and tell them this good news that I was about to become the fashion director at Vibe.  I had a long conversation with my dad and I was telling him all about it.  So the next morning, the phone rings very early, and it's my mother hysterical on the phone.  My father had dropped dead in the customs in St. Croix coming back home, of a massive heart attack.  So within a month's period of time, I had to help my mother and my brother [Erik Wilbekin], we had to bury my father, I had to shoot twenty pages of fashion, and then I had to leave for Milan [Italy] to go to the men's fashion shows.  And my father was dead.  And my whole world was like upside down.  So we get to Milan--I make it through the shoots, I make it through the funeral, I became a man through this process, and the first night we have dinner with Quincy.  And I said, "Mr. Jones, I just wanna tell you something.  My father just passed away, so if I burst out into tears in the middle of a fashion show or at any time, please forgive me."  He said, "Don't worry, son, I'll be your father on this trip."  That's Quincy Jones.
Story_ID: 156505
Speaker 1: So you, you were describing this time in Milan [Italy] when you'd just become fashion director [of Vibe]--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --you met with [HM] Quincy [Jones].  How long were you there?  What was that experience like?
Speaker 2: So this is--I had been to fashion shows in New York [New York], so I kinda knew the basic ins and out; I knew the protocol and things like that.  What I didn't, you know, take into consideration is, as fashion director, you then sit on the front row.  So suddenly I'm sitting on the front row of all the fashion shows, I'm with Quincy Jones; I'm also with Kidada [Jones] and Rashida [Jones], his daughters.  And because Quincy Jones is with us with Vibe, I'm meeting Giorgio Armani, Dolce and Gabbana, Tom Borden.  And when I say meeting, I mean we're having lunches, dinners, we're in their homes, we're in their offices, we're in their ateliers.  So suddenly, I'm like, what is going on right now?  And it almost felt like--okay, I had a big dream; this is eclipsing anything that I imagined, and I'm there for probably seven to ten days, and then everyone else leaves and then I go to Paris [France] by myself for men's shows.  and I remember being like--okay, I've been to Paris before, but then like there's a car and a driver and I'm again on the front row, and I'm kind of like this darling because I'm the newest fashion director, you know, on the block, and I'm from Vibe which is very kind of, you know, getting a lot of critical acclaim; people are talking about it a lot, there was a lot of buzz coming out of Milan because Quincy was with us, we had big party, so it was just a really crazy time.  But then for me, I'm like--and my father [Harvey Wilbekin] just died; so it was, it was a lot going on, but a very, very exciting time.
Speaker 1: How old was Vibe at this time?
Speaker 2: Vibe, at that time, was probably like six years old?
Story_ID: 156506
Speaker 1: What was its [Vibe's] circulation at this point?
Speaker 2: At that time, it was--the circulation of Vibe was probably 500,000, so it was doing well.  So then I had this--I mean I loved fashion, so fashion meets journalism, and I did kind of create these amazing narratives through pictures and worked with all these amazing photographers and models and their makeup people and stylists.  And it was, it was incredible; like I honestly was like, if this is it, I'm good.  Like I could just do this for the rest of my life; I'm fine, I'm traveling, I'm shooting all over the world.  And so I did it--and the fashion pages are growing.  I did it, and then suddenly I'm in Paris [France] shooting Puffy [Sean "Diddy" Combs] for his first day or some party he's doing in Paris.  I'm in my hotel room, gonna go out one last night before I go back to New York [New York], and the phone rings and it's Danyel Smith who was, at that time, the editor-in-chief; she's a wonderful woman.  She had been the music editor; she really groomed me as an editor and had really given me free reign as a fashion director to really tell these beautiful stories, and she [Danyel Smith] said, "I just resigned."  And I'm like, "Hggh."  And she had been the third editor-in-chief of Vibe; it was Alan Light before her, and then Jonathan [Van Meter], and I was like, I just can't take--I don't think I could take another editor-in-chief.  Like everything's changed so many times, and I've been here for so long; maybe it's time for me to think about moving on, if she leaves.  And she said, "Well, I recommended that you become editor-in-chief."  I'm like, "Me?  You gotta be kidding me."  She's like, "But you can't tell anybody."  So, of course, I call my mother [Cleota Proctor Wilbekin] and I'm like, "Oh, my God, guess what?"  So that night, go out in Paris with Puffy, Lenny Kravitz, Benny Medina, Stella McCartney, and Kate Moss.  And I'm just like, are you kidding me God, like this is my life right now?  And it was so funny because Puffy was on one side saying, "You need to tell your girl Danyel that she needs to put me on the cover for my next album."  And Lenny's in the other ear like, "You need to tell your girl Danyel to put me on the cover for my next album."  And I'm in my mind like, I'm actually gonna be your girl, and I'm the one that's gonna decide who gets to go on the cover and--but I can't tell you.  And it was the most spectacular night, and I remember flying back the next day and just--I literally was pinching myself in the airplane seat because I couldn't believe that this was happening in Paris, of all places, and my dream was really, really coming true.  I came back, I met with Gil Rogan, I met with the people from Time Inc., and then it was announced that I would become editor-in-chief.
Story_ID: 156507
Speaker 1: Before we go into your editor-in-chief [of Vibe] space--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --let's go back to fashion for a moment.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the people who you were working with, like the photographers, hair and makeup, the talent--who were some of the--can you show what some of those stories were?  And you said you were traveling around the world--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --can you show us some of those shoots?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  So--I mean there was a really--I mean phenomenal photo-editor at Vibe named George Pitts and George Pitts--I went to him and I was like, "I love magazines, I love photography, I love this and that."  And he said, "Okay, I'm gonna teach you how to train your eye."  I said, "Okay, I think I'm pretty good."  So he's like, "Okay, show me; here's two pictures, what do you like about this picture?"  And I tell him.  And then he's like, "Okay, well what do you like about this picture?"  And I tell him.  He's like, "Okay, none of that makes any sense, so this is what you need to look for.  This is what you--you need to look at composition, you need to look at lighting, you need to look at"--he basically trained my eye, and focused my eye.  So the one thing--I had learned how to produce my own fashion stories, so that was kind of taken off of his plate, and I worked with Marc Baptiste, I worked with Guy Aroch, I worked with Christian Witkin, I worked with Albert Watson, and I also worked with a lot of up-and-coming photographers, so Arnaldo Anaya-Lucca, and we would develop these stories.  And everyone was always so impressed because I would come with like not only a full-on storyboard, but I would usually have sketched out what I wanted the shoots to look like in my journals, and it was great.  We were working with incredible hair and makeup artists, working a lot with like Chuck Amos, with Same Fine, with Oscar James--just really amazing, talented people who would always help push the vision even further.  And that was one thing that I learned as fashion director was I know what I know, and I don't know what I don't know.  And I learned very quickly that specifically with hair and makeup, get out of the way because it's a process, and it looks completely different through the lens than it actually looks in person.  I was really fortunate with the photographers that they liked this whole that I was directing, that I had a vision, and I, I observed a lot; I watched what they did with lighting, I watched what they did with effects, and it was really collaborative and it was amazing, and we would--I worked with this guy David Trentenusci [ph.], who was this up-and-coming Italian photographer, and we would go to Brazil and Rio [de Janeiro, Brazil], and we spent like ten days in Rio and we just shot life in Rio, and there's images of a guy diving into the water off the cliffs.  We went to a samba school and dressed the kids up in beablose [ph.], and had them playing instruments in the middle of a samba school; I mean it was incredible.  And it was incredible to show brown people in a liberated, empowered, and creative and beautiful way, and that was really important to me.  The magazine, prior to me becoming fashion director, had gotten a lotta criticism for the way that they depicted women, and that they didn't look beautiful and they didn't look glamorous.  And so that was something that was very in my mind and something that I had to really make sure it didn't happen.  We worked with--there was a model that--my best friend Calvin Wilson was then at Next Model Management, and he sent this woman, this Jamaican woman, to meet with me named Nicola Vassell, and Nicola was this beautiful dark-skin Jamaican girl, and I took her under my wing and I was like, "I'm gonna shoot you and use you in a lotta shoots."  And so I also developed a cast of characters that people--Will Lemay and Nicola Vassell, Crystal--they were these models that you kind of knew would be in the stories, but they would be shot totally different every time and re-imagined.  So it was really, really fun, really exciting, and I think the people in fashion were just kinda blown away because I remember going to a dinner with the people from Prada, and they were like, "We'll never advertise in Vibe, ever."  A lot of people said that, and then this woman who I had met at a fashion party who said she was in love with my work--they were looking for a fashion ad sales director, and they said, "Who do you wanna recommend?"  I said, "This woman is named Bevy Smith, and she's from Harlem [New York, New York] and she's fabulous and she's glamorous, and she'll get it, and she'll be able to sell it."  And they brought her in, and she said it's the easiest sales job she ever had to do because the work spoke for itself.  And we got Gucci and we got Prada and we had Versace and we had everybody in that magazine, and no one could figure it out because they weren't advertising in a lot of the mainstream magazines but they would then advertise in Vibe.
Story_ID: 156508
Speaker 1: How did you come to know Bevy [Smith]?
Speaker 2: So Bevy and I were introduced by a man named Stan Williams, used to be a reporter at DNR [Daily News Record], the men's news journal--fashion journal, and he said, "You have to meet this woman; she's a huge fan of your work, she loves the story.  And so I was--we were at a Wallpaper party--magazine party at Club Monaco, and I fell in love with her instantly, and she was so effusive, and so we developed a rapport and my colleague Mimi Valdes was also friendly with her, and so when the opportunity came up for this fashion advertising position, we were like, "Let's put her name in the ring and"--
Speaker 1: Was she already doing sales?
Speaker 2: She came from the agency side, so she had definitely experience and knowledge, but she brought her own Harlem [New York, New York] swagger to it, and I remember she was doing like street-style photos in Harlem to show advertisers how designers' goods were being worn in the 'hood, and it was very, very powerful and it, it helped move the needle.
Story_ID: 156509
Speaker 1: Behind the scenes are [HM] Keith Clinkscales and [HM Leonard] Len Burnett [Jr.]; when did they become a part of Vibe?
Speaker 2: So Keith Clinkscales and Len Burnett, you know, these--these bright young men from FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Florida A&M University, Tallahassee, Florida], they came in after the launch of Vibe and, you know, were needed.  We needed a business perspective, we needed someone that understood ad sales and that could, from a business side, really sell the magazine and grow the brand.  They had all these great ideas; they had done their own magazine at FAMU, so they were like ready to rock and roll, and then you marry that with this very kind of eclectic, thirsty, creative, editorial side, and it--it was, it was a lot (laughter).  It was good, it was fun, there was a lotta drama, but there was a lot of passion, and I think that that passion and that energy together really helped create the foundation for the growth of Vibe.  But it was interesting because you had a lot of young people working at Vibe who had either never had real jobs before; they may have interned somewhere but suddenly they're in the auspices of Time Inc. and, even though we're not in the office--and there was a lotta drama, a lot--and then there was a lotta drama because Jonathan Van Meter was the white editor of this magazine and he was really taken to task for that, I think sometimes fairly, I think sometimes unfairly.  And there was just--there was just a lotta creativity, and in the spirit of hip-hop, everyone had ego, and so everybody had great ideas, everybody knew what Vibe should be, and that was kind of the blessing and the curse of Vibe was that it was all things to all people.  But then it also wasn't all things to all people, so everyone wanted it to be what they in their hearts wanted it to be, but that ownership was good for building the audience and the following, but then not always good when what you saw in the magazine maybe didn't fit that.  So it was, it was challenging, and I would have to say that probably Jonathan, super talented, I think ahead of his time for what--where the community was, where the culture was--I think he was ahead of his time.  And I think that there were just a lot of changes and a lot of things that were just not right for the times.
Story_ID: 156510
Speaker 1: How would you describe the voice of Vibe magazine, especially in the context of other--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --black publications.
Speaker 2: What was interesting about Vibe was that it was very, very journalistic; it was long-form journalism, you know.  Jonathan [Van Meter] and Diane [Cardwell] had worked at 7 Days, Alan Light had worked at Rolling Stone, Scott [Poulson-Bryant] and Joan [Morgan] and Kevin [Powell] had written a lot for the Village Voice, so it was that--like you didn't read long-form journalism about African Americans at that time.  Now, it's very commonplace to see, you know, Kerry Washington or Beyonce or Jay Z or Rihanna on the cover of mainstream magazines.  At that time, people like that were not given covers; so not only were you seeing them photographed in this very incredible way, but you were reading this--really well-reported, well-written, powerful journalistic stories that really made it the cannon of kind of R&B and hip-hop music of that time.  And then also, this is the era of the development of hip-hop where hip-hop was, as they said, in its golden era.  So this is when you have Biggie Smalls [Notorious B.I.G.] from the East Coast and Tupac [Shakur] from the West Coast and, you know, pockets of the South developing.  And there was a lotta controversy in that because this is--these were kids from the street who had nothing but their voice, and there were turf wars and, you know, who--is Puffy [Sean "Diddy" Combs] behind this or is [Marion Hugh] "Suge" Knight [Jr.]?  And there was a lotta drama so, in all this glamour, it was also a little scary because people were getting killed and shot.
Story_ID: 156511
Speaker 1: Vibe, Vibe had awards--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and parties after the big award ceremonies.
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Did--set us up for the Biggie [Smalls, also known as Notorious B.I.G.].
Speaker 2: So I was--so the Soul Train Awards, really big award show, and Vibe was having an after party at the Car Museum on Wilshire [Boulevard, Los Angeles, California].  I was out there; I had friends out there because I was shooting, and I remember going to the party and being--you know, my father [Harvey Wilbekin] being an architectural engineer, was always super concerned about exits and safety, and things like that.  So we walk in, and I see interns from the magazine are there, I see people that have no business being at this party there, and I'm like--all these glass staircases and balconies, and I'm like, "Something doesn't feel right."  And I remember telling my friends, I'm like, "I'm leaving."  And they're like, "You can't leave, it's your party; you work here."  I was like, "I have to go; like my gut and my spirit tells me that I need to leave."  So they're like, "Okay."  So we leave, and I remember seeing Heavy D in the parking lot when I was leaving.  He's like, "Man, where are you going?  It's your party, you can't leave," and I was like, "No, I have to go."  I remember we went to Santa Monica [California], we had drinks, I was dropping friends off, I passed back by the Museum, and I see flares everywhere--not uncommon in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], so I'm like, 'Okay, weird but okay.'  I went back to my hotel, I go to sleep.  My phone is ringing in the morning the next morning, and my friends are calling from New York [New York] like, "Are you okay?"  And I'm like, "Yeah, I'm fine; was there an earthquake?  Like what happened?"  And they're like, "Biggie was shot outside of your party last night."  And I, I didn't even know what to think, and I was just freaked out and I remember calling people from work and making sure everybody was okay, and then trying to get outta L.A. as fast as I could 'cause we--it just felt like--what is about to happen?  Like Biggie is, you know, arguably, one of the best rappers in history is dead.  So--and outside of a Vibe party.  So it just--there was a moment with Vibe where it almost felt like, you know, because we were covering this very, very, very important music scene and what was happening, you know, we were criticized for fanning the flames of this, and also were we responsible in some way for Biggie's death?  So it was, it was very dark; it was like a dark period.  It was scary, it was weird--
Speaker 1: When was this?
Speaker 2: This was around 1996.  So it was--it was really kinda scary.
Story_ID: 156512
Speaker 1: Was this around the same time that the magazine [Vibe] was sold?--
Speaker 2: --Yes--
Speaker 1: --Miller Publishing?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you know anything about the behind-the-scenes of the sale?
Speaker 2: You know, I--I don't know specifics about the details of the sale, but I believe that as the East Coast/West Coast drama heated up, there was this need to distance the big corporation from the independent magazine that is covering all this stuff in a very progressive and in-your-face way.
Speaker 1: When the magazine was purchased, some shifts began.  Danyel [Smith], I believe, took the reigns.
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Can you describe what the editorial environment was like as the magazine is leaving Time [Warner]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --to become part of a smaller company?
Speaker 2: I think--when the magazine was sold, I believe that there was this kind of exhale moment in many ways because we wanted to kind of keep the spirit and energy of the magazine alive, and felt that we were maybe being curtailed a bit.  I would have to say what's great about Danyel is that she had been there as a music editor, she was from the West Coast.  Danyel, if nothing, is unapologetic in her stance as an editor, and so we felt like we had a fearless leader.  And it was also nice to have a black woman as the editor of this magazine, so there was also kind of this nurturing kind of sensibility and kind of like, okay, we're gonna come together, we're gonna make this happen, we're gonna do the best, we're gonna keep our heads straightforward and focused, and we're gonna work hard and keep doing amazing work.  So from that perspective, it, it didn't feel scary; our benefits didn't change that much, our pay didn't change that much.  Our budgets probably changed slightly, but it felt like business as usual.
Story_ID: 156513
Speaker 1: So talking about budgets.  You produced some very extravagant shoots all over the world with top people.
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: How were you able to execute those?  What were your budgets [at Vibe magazine] like during that time?
Speaker 2: Our budgets at that time, when I was fashion director, were--I wouldn't say they were generous but I would say they were solid.  And I basically, I think, you know, really knew how to work a budget, so how could I do--if I wanna shoot in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], I'm gonna shoot--how many shoots am I gonna do in L.A. at one time?  If I wanna shoot in Rio [de Janeiro, Brazil], then I'm gonna have to shoot x-amount of shoots in New York, and have like seamless backgrounds, so it was kind of that, you know, I worked the budgets.  And the one thing that I was really proud of was I was like, we're gonna have catering, we're going to have everything that you need to have a successful shoot.  And people loved it, and we made it happen.  I think Danyel [Smith] probably gave us a little more grace with the budgets because she knew that the visuals and the fashion were a big advertising selling point and was a point of difference from the other urban books in our space, so I definitely think that.  And in fact, like I used to style covers; like wherever we could make things work, we did.
Story_ID: 156514
Speaker 1: Who, who were your [Vibe magazine] competitors at that time?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, our competitors would have been the Source and kind of XXL but, you know, we were like if it's Rolling Stone, it's been--you know, we looked at who were the bigger players.  I mean--yes, the Source and XXL, like yeah, they're competitors, but like who--you know, Rolling Stone and Spinner are competitors.
Speaker 1: Can you describe when Danyel [Smith] said that she had put your name in the ring to be editor?  When did you find out that was indeed going to be true?  What, what happened?
Speaker 2: So I came back from Paris [France] and it was then menswear week in New York [New York], and it was about a week later, and I'm antsy 'cause I'm like, I need to know, like come on, I wanna start.  And so Gil Rogan took me to--was still consulting from Time Inc., and we went to Empire Diner and it was like right after this Nautica fashion show, and he's like, "So what do you wanna do?"  And I pulled out a notebook.  I was like, "Here it is."  And he's like, "You have this already laid out."  I was like, "Yeah."  And so my emphasis was music is the base, but we need to focus on what the culture is because the music at that time was still very popular, but it was starting to wane, and what was happening was that as hip-hop went more mass, then fashion was taking its inspiration from hip-hop.  You were seeing more influence in film and Hollywood and Will Smith and Queen Latifah, like they were going and doing big budget films and becoming producers.  So you saw, to me, where TV, film, fashion, everything was following the music, and now it's becoming a lifestyle.  People are getting older, people are having kids, people are getting married.  So how do you still tell that story where it's relevant, you still keep the very powerful voice, the writing?  You think differently, but how do you make it broader?  And so that was kind of my vision for what Vibe would become.
Story_ID: 156515
Speaker 1: You were ed-- editor-in-chief [of Vibe] for what period of time, and what did you accomplish during that time?
Speaker 2: So I was editor-in-chief from 1998 'til about-plus five year-- 2001 [sic, 1999-2002].  And what was really great about it was that I was able to kind of make it really, really in your face because I did come from fashion and I did have that background, but I also had the journalistic background, and so we dove in and we did really, really amazing reporting and writing and beautiful visuals, and so the big, big pinnacle was for the 1992 [sic, 2002] issue calendar year.  We won the National Magazine Award from the American Society of Magazine Editors and we beat out the New Yorker, Wire, Jane, and Gourmet.  And that was game-changing because, aside from Essence, no other magazine that dealt with people of color had won an ASME [American Society of Magazine Editors].
Speaker 1: This was 2002--
Speaker 2: Two thousand, I'm sorry; thank you.
Speaker 1: --right.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So describe, it was-- describe the title of the award that you received.
Speaker 2: So we won the National Magazine Award for General Excellence, and so the ASMEs are like the Oscars of the magazine industry and, for me, it was just this really incredible moment of, wow, like we did this; and it was great.  My mom [Cleota Proctor Wilbekin] and my grandmother [Julia Proctor] were there with me.  My mother was like, "I thought you knew you won already."  I was like, "No, it's like they announce who wins."  So she was like, "Really," I'm like, "Yeah."  And as I went to the stage to accept the award, I remember David Remnick from New York--New Yorker getting up and shaking my hand, and right when I turned the corner to go up the steps, Dorothy Kalins was sitting there, so that was like this whole full circle moment.  My mother had me practice my speech before so I wouldn't break down and cry during the, the--in case I won.  I remember being in hives the whole week before; I've never had hives before.  And the big part of my speech was that we were giving people who didn't have a voice a voice.  And so afterwards, Gayle King came over, [HM] Susan Taylor and Ed Lewis [HM Edward Lewis]--like all these people were coming over to congratulate me, and I was--I was really stunned and floored because I couldn't believe we actually won.
Story_ID: 156516
Speaker 1: Speaking about giving people a voice, during this time, you--what was your involvement in the gay community ov-- over your time at Vibe?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the things that was very, very important to me was again, what are our social causes that we believe in?  So, you know, are we--is it literacy?  So we helped with literacy projects.  But the thing is that HIV and AIDS was devastating the black community at this time, and especially--at that time, I think men were more at risk than--now, women are more at risk.  And I thought, I gotta do something.  I have this platform.  So I remember Lifebeat had done numerous events with urban artists called Urban Aid, and so I was on a host community; like I was helping.  I was like, "You guys can meet at Vibe in a board room."  And so Kevin Liles and all these people were coming to the meetings, and they were like, "This guy is really passionate about this."
Speaker 1: Will you explain what Lifebeat is?
Speaker 2: So Lifebeat is the Music Industry Fights AIDS, and basically, they do a lot of education, outreach, and support in the community, so educating young people, passing out condoms at concerts and getting artists to do PSAs [public service announcements] and really speak out about HIV and AIDS and how to stop the pandemic.  So it was great; it worked really well with the platform of the magazine, and it was something that I believe we were giving back to the community and, and kind of trying to make a difference.
Speaker 1: Out Magazine--what was your relationship with Out Magazine, including them honoring you?
Speaker 2: Well, it was interesting with gay media and myself at the time because here I am thinking, you know, we're doing a story about homo-thugs and we're doing--we're, you know, and trying to bring this to light to help people understand who they are and not--I don't mean people outside the community--the community to understand who they are and be okay with who they are, and then also to take artists to task for using homophobia and misogyny in their lyrics, and GLAAD Out people just didn't see me; they were like, "You're putting Eminem on the cover, you're doing all these things."  And I'm like, "I'm doing all this hard work, like why won't you recognize me?"  And then finally--I think Out was more supportive in terms of putting me on power lists and things like that, and I will never forget, right after winning the National Magazine Award, the New York Times sent a reporter to interview me about, you know, who I was and things like that, and she said, "Are you gay?"  And I paused and I said--and I started laughing, and she's like, "Well, what's funny?" And I said, "Well, I am, but I guess I'm officially gay now that I'll be in the New York Times saying that I'm gay."  But that was the thing; it was very important for me to be an out gay man editing this hip-hop culture magazine because I had to be true to myself, I had to honor my truth, and I also wanted to inspire other people who were gay, or knew people who were gay, to know that it's okay to be who you are and to stand up for yourself.
Speaker 1: Did you ever get any pushback from the hip-hop community?
Speaker 2: You know what?  Not really; it was really--it was such a life lesson for me about authenticity and living your truth because everyone already knew.  When I was a fas-- like everyone knew I was gay, so for me to have gone into the closet would have been horrible.  And people respected that I was so clear; there were a couple of instances where I would go to listening sessions with artists and I would hear the lyrics, and I wouldn't do it in front of other journalists or the record label people, but I'd reach out to them and say, "I don't think that you should do that; that's really not good."  And sometimes they would listen and sometimes not, but I would say for the most part, people were super supportive and cool.
Story_ID: 156517
Speaker 1: How you, how long were you in your role as editor-in-chief at Vibe, and when did you--and what did you transition into after--
Speaker 2: --So I was editor-in-chief for about four years; we won the National Magazine Award.  I also--you know, one of the big things about the National Magazine Award was one of the issues that was included--you submit, I think, three issues, and one was our December [2001] issue which was a tribute--it happened right basically during 9/11 [September 11, 2001 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in New York, New York], and it was this--it just--everything changed at that point, and I remember in the logo, Lenny Kravitz was on the cover with this afro and his sun glasses, and then we put stars and stripes in the logo, and did a whole package around, you know, how 9/11 was affecting the black community and how urban artists were reacting and things like that.  The crazy thing was we did the shoot with Lenny on September 10th [2001], and I remember being on top of the roof of the studio where we shot and seeing the twin towers [World Trade Center], so it was--I mean it was really close to home.  So then I was editor-in-chief for four years; there was pressure for me from management to kind of make the magazine younger and more hip-hop and more gritty, and be more competitive with the Source.  I was getting older, I was, you know, like early thirties, and I just was like, "I don't think that that's right."  And so one day I got a call that was like, "Okay, you're being transitioned into a new role; you can decide what it's called.  It'll kind of be like a big picture brand development role, you can or cannot work with editorial; it's up to you.  We really wanna develop television film."  Digital at that time was very new--products--all these different things.  And my friend and protege, Mimi Valdes, took on the reigns of editor-in-chief, and I became vice president of brand development for the brand, and I did that for about a year.  And it was kind of exciting 'cause it was like very new working with Rob [Robert] Kenner on books and like, you know, developing like what's digital?  And what would our digital offering be, and going to Hollywood to meet about film and television.  A lot of people don't know that the 'Fast and Furious' was actually based on an article from Vibe about street drag car racing.  So we knew that there was opportunity there to take some of our really great journalistic pieces and develop them into film and television projects.  So it was really, really great, but I just kind of felt lost and I felt like I kind of like maybe my time had run out there, and that the end of that era was there for me, and I left and I went to go work with Marc Ecko.  And that was very, very cool because, you know, Marc was like, "You're such a great businessman," and I was like, "No, I'm such a great editorial person."  And as I worked with him and worked on his men's collection and consulted on Complex and worked with him on developing his video game, I was like, oh, I am a good businessperson.  But I didn't realize that it's the same acumen, just how you work it and how you present it.  And so I did that; I worked with him for a year, which was an amazing opportunity 'cause I really think that he opened my mind up on how to see things differently.
Speaker 1: What year was this?
Speaker 2: That was 2003 or '04 [2004].  I was there four years--'99 [1999] so I think I left in 2004.
Story_ID: 156518
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: It's on my resume I'll send it to you--
Speaker 1: -- Was Marc Ecko--can you describe who Marc Ecko was during this time period?  Also Complex--was it unusual for a designer to have a magazine?
Speaker 2: So Marc Ecko had really made a name for himself.  He was a graffiti artist that started doing tee shirts; he used the symbol of the rhinoceros because it's an endangered species and it's also one of the few mammals that does not move backwards, it only moves forward.  And so he and I had been friendly, and his company was becoming really popular.  He was developing all these accessory lines, he had partnered collections with 50 Cent, and with Eve, and this new skate line called Zoo York, and he was building this kind of urban empire.  He also started this magazine 'cause he liked magazines, and that was really focused on sneaker culture, but it was taken from the model of Japanese shopping magazines but developed for young men who lived in urban centers.  And so, you know, he's like, "What do you want your title to be?"  And I was like--"for Complex?"  And I was like, "I wanna be the style guru 'cause it's like different and fun and young."  And then, as vice president of brand development for Marc Ecko Collection, he had developed a men's tailored collection that would basically be for men who are my age, like early thirties, who were professionals but still grew up on hip-hop and wanted to have fun with their wardrobe but still needed to dress up a little bit more, and it was great, it was really fun.  I brought other people from other industries; everyone on staff was super-young, and it was great.  It was a little hard for me because suddenly I was on the other side where I'm pitching my friends and editors stories about Marc when I'm used to being the one being pitched.  But it was, it was good--and also to help him kind of step up his presence in media and things like that, and we had a good time.
Story_ID: 156519
Speaker 1: You decided it was time to leave Vibe.
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: What did you do next?
Speaker 2: So I went to go work with Marc Ecko; I was vice president of brand development, worked on his men's tailor collection; worked with him on developing kind of the ancillary parts of his video game that he was developing, as well as consulting on Complex as the style guru.
Speaker 1: And after that year, what were your next choices?
Speaker 2: So then I took some time off where I basically was doing freelance writing, traveling, and then had the fortune to start contributing to BlackVoices at AOL, and did some red carpet work for them, did some writing for them.
Speaker 1: The big opportunity that came, though, was--Microsoft was developing a website dedicated to LeBron James, and so for a year I blogged about LeBron James' life off the court, and I went to Akron [Ohio] and Cleveland [Ohio], which was so interesting 'cause I was born in Cleveland, and I would go every other week and I would write about his philanthropic work.  It started then edging into the basketball because they were--the Cavaliers were in the playoffs.  I got to go to China with them for exhibition basketball games, to the All-Star game in New Orleans [Louisiana], and it was just a fascinating new world of blogging and doing that type of work for someone who was like a huge sports athlete star in the world.
Speaker 2: What was the experience like being with LeBron?  What was he like?
Speaker 1: LeBron is great; LeBron is very, very human, very, very--he's like a gentle giant.  He grew up--single mom in Akron, so he's very about his community, giving back, and very about inspiring young people to do well in school, to be--do well in their community, so I loved it; it was, it was an incredible experience.
Speaker 2: Did you spend a lot of time with him?
Speaker 1: Not as much time as I thought; like it was--he's very kind of hold back, so it's--his team of young people--but, yeah, it was very observing, which was interesting 'cause I'm used to having more kind of very, very close contact, but he was super respectful and, you know, would just come over and put his hand on my shoulder or like--you know, he'd let you know he's there and he sees you, but he was managed very carefully.
Speaker 2: And was this your entry into blogging?  And what was blogging like for you, coming from a traditional journalism background?
Speaker 1: Well, for me, blogging was really fun because I got short 'cause I knew how to do short if I needed to.  The frequency was kind of--I had to post twice a week, but then I had to work with the community group that was around it online; but it was great to have to go to Microsoft and like work with them developing what the site would look like, how it would operate, and again, right place at the right time.  I learned a ton.
Story_ID: 156520
Speaker 1: From there--did you work with Sean John from there?
Speaker 2: Well, Sean John--I just--I consulted on projects.  I did a lotta consulting, so I worked with Sean John, I worked with Team Epiphany, with Bombay Sapphire and some other projects that they had.  I really just did things that I--projects I loved doing and I got paid to do them, so it was just kinda fun.
Speaker 1: How did they come to be, though?  Was it relationships?  Like Tweety [ph.]--was he part of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, most of my consulting was based on relationships and people knowing that I have a certain pace level expertise that I could curate in a certain way, and so they would ask me to help out on projects.
Speaker 1: And Smokey Fontaine--how long have you known him at this point?
Speaker 2: I knew Smokey--Smokey used to intern at Vibe with Scott Poulson-Bryant, so I knew him for a really long time; I'd been watching what he was doing with America which--and then it became GIANT.  So it was funny--he asked me to come to the office; I thought he was gonna ask me to freelance 'cause I had been doing some writing for them (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--And this is when it was GIANT.
Speaker 2: This is when it was GIANT.  And so he asked me to come in to meet him in the office and was very formal, and I thought, oh, he's gonna' you know, ask me to do some more freelance projects or something, and he said that they wanted me to become editor-in-chief of GIANT.  So at the time I thought, ugggh, do I wanna go back to magazines and--but I love magazines, but this also had a huge digital offering because it was owned by Radio One under the division of Interactive One, and he was actually gonna go take on building out all these verticals, and so I would run GIANT and re-design giantmag.com [later, giantlife.com].
Speaker 1: And can you describe--what is GIANT magazine and who's its audience?
Speaker 2: So GIANT I really liked because for me, it was multi-cultural, it was young, it was edgy; but they would do like twenty-page photo-shoots in like these incredibly written long-form journalism, and it was--part of the idea, though was that I would make it more African American-focused 'cause it was a little bit too multi-cultural for Radio One's taste level and [HM] Cathy Hughes' perspective.  So I thought, great, wonderful.  So we did--the first cover was with Kimora Lee Simmons, we did covers with Don Cheadle, did covers with Naomi Campbell, with Nick Cannon; so it was a very kind of cool, fun, exciting time, and I got to work with a bunch of talent that I loved working with--photographers, stylists, hair and makeup people, writers; and got more immersed in digital.
Speaker 1: What kind of circulation does GIANT have at this point?
Speaker 2: GIANT's circulation was--I mean max 200,000 maybe; it was niche, they weren't really trying to grow it that much, and it was fine.  There were people from Vibe that worked there like Jeff Mazzacano, so it was, it was like working on a cool art project and getting paid to do it and learning digital on the side.
Story_ID: 156521
Speaker 1: So when did Essence come into the picture?
Speaker 2: So in 2009, Angela Burt-Murray starts calling me because she and I would be judging at different ASME [American Society of Magazine Editors] projects together and would just be talking, and I think she noticed that I had a lotta digital acumen and knowledge, and Time Warner started to recruit me to come run essence.com to help develop the website, give it a younger perspective, and grow the audience.
Speaker 1: And leaving GIANT to go to Essence meant what to you?
Speaker 2: Well, here's the thing--GIANT--the money was running out for GIANT, they weren't gonna be able to support it as a print vehicle; it was gonna be strictly digital, and I thought, if I'm going to stay in magazines and publishing, I think that I should go to Time Inc. and Time Warner versus staying at Radio One, and my mother [Cleota Proctor Wilbekin] said, "You are gonna take the job at Essence."  And I also had never been on staff at Essence and I think that--you know, I grew up on Essence, I had written for Essence.  Essence is this iconic publication in our community, and I thought, well, if I'm gonna do it, let's do it.  Also, I liked that the website was a joint venture with Time Warner and Telepictures, so that was interesting; and then also, you know, being able to work at this, this im--iconic magazine.
Speaker 1: What was it like to be a male going to run a website targeted to females?
Speaker 2: There was definitely a learning curve of what it is like to work at a woman's service book 'cause I had never done that; I had never worked at a women's focused publication or site.  It was cool though; everyone was so lovely and really, really supportive of what I was doing, and I think they understood that I was bringing a different perspective, that I was trying to go younger and a little more edgy, and it was hard, but it was also--we saw results.  So it was interesting; it was kind of interesting given this charge; like how do we make this off-shoot of Essence this younger and cooler and different?  And so that part, I really, really enjoyed.
Speaker 1: How did the demographics [of essence.com] change under your watch?
Speaker 2: Well, the website traffic was good but it wasn't great.  I think people started coming to the site because it was updated regularly, we re-designed it into a blog role format, I brought a lot of kind of tastemaker influencer people to the site, we started doing street style celebrity photos--all the things that are very digestible for people online, and things that they waned.  I mean the issue with digital traffic is that people really go for trashy, you know, news, and as part of Time Inc., and particularly part of Essence, it was challenging for us to do that because it hurts relationships, it's not part of like Time Inc.'s journalistic standards, and so we could grow it only so much and--but we did a good job, and we did two re-designs when I was there.
Story_ID: 156522
Speaker 1: An-- when did you join the [Essence] magazine staff?
Speaker 2: So I joined the magazine staff--2009--2012 is when I started.  And basically, everyone saw that I had this great relationship with celebrities, so there was a need at the magazine and the brand to have someone who was really an ambassador for the brand, who was connected to celebrities, who understood how to create covers, and who could not only leverage those relationships for the magazine, but across the brand.  So for the [Essence Music] festival, for the (unclear) events like Black Women in Hollywood, Black Women in Music, and any other events that we did--and also like leverage it for digital.  Like how could you really bring young, cool women and celebrities to Essence?  And so that was kind of the goal, and it was--I mean it was fun, and to create Essence covers was like a dream come true.
Speaker 1: Now, was Mikki Taylor still there during the time that you were creating covers?
Speaker 2: Mikki was there, but Mikki was consulting more on marketing events and things like that.  I was a bit terrified to follow Mikki Taylor, but I remember like the first cover that I did, she came and found me and was like, "Good job."  And so then I was like, okay, I can do this--
Speaker 1: --She was not at the shoot--it was--
Speaker 2: --No, no; I don't know--I think Mikki may have been at one shoot that I was--had ever worked on while I was there, and even that, she was like in and out.  Mikki actually really encouraged me to bring my arsenal of experience and knowledge and talent with me on that journey of creating those covers and was very, very supportive of my work.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the cover subjects who you would consider, you know, your highlights during that period?
Speaker 2: I mean I think of--I mean shooting [HM] President [Barack] Obama, incredible.  The Gabrielle Union-Dwayne Wade cover was a real coup because they had never been photographed together, and that was really great.  Nia Long with her children--you know, Essence always kind of gets criticized for having the same people over and over again; there's reasons magazines have the same people over and over again (laughter), so I thought, how can we re-imagine them?  How can we get them more depth and more--how do you give more of a story?  So those were some of my favorite.  And then the Hollywood cover with, you know, Queen Latif--I mean--sorry.  The Hollywood cover with Oprah Winfrey, Forest Whitaker, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Michael B. Jordan was a coup.  The cover with Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry was a coup because Oprah typically doesn't do magazine covers outside of O, and so to be able to do these types of covers which, again, how do you elevate the brand?  How do you elevate the images?
Story_ID: 156523
Speaker 1: You were at Essence when there was a lotta controversy.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you describe what it was like being part of Essence when there was a national outcry regarding the white fashion director?
Speaker 2: There was--you know, the thing is Essence comes under fire quite often.  When the--Ellianna Placas was hired to be the fashion director, there was just a lot of controversy.  Now, at that time, I sat on the digital side, so in a way I was a bit removed from it, but you're still part of the family, you're still part of the brand.  And I think that that was a hard time for the magazine and the brand, and for the audience--to really understand why this was happening.
Speaker 1: And then the editor-in-chief--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --left in less than a ceremonious way.  What was that experience like for you there?
Speaker 2: I guess for me having worked in publishing as long as I have, I have seen editor-in-chiefs come and go, so seeing Angela [Burt-Murray] leave the way that she did, you know, I had seen it before.  But like for people who hadn't experienced that, it was very shocking.  I follow publishing a lot, so I know that these things happen, and it's the kinda thing--the mantra there was always the brand is bigger than one individual, and so that was the case and we would just move on.  So we moved on and we moved on and we moved on.
Speaker 1: In the industry, there was talk about who was going to fill those shoes--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --and--including you.
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And what was your experience when that opening was available and many, many, many people were coming to be considered for the role?
Speaker 2: It was a very interesting time, and again, I had given up aspirations of magazines quite a while ago, like Vibe was my like big love affair with magazines.  But I thought, why couldn't I be the editor-in-chief of Essence?  And it was interesting because it was--you know, I talked to people about it, I threw my name in the ring, and I will say that I've never been--I will say let down--in such a very lovely and gracious way that I got it, and it made complete sense to me in terms of the audience needing to see someone that looked like them heading that magazine.  There's no other magazine for black women, so I got it, and I was treated with such dignity and respect in the conversation, and, and I appreciated it; so it was, it was good.
Story_ID: 156524
Speaker 1: And when did you leave Essence, and what did you--what was next from there?
Speaker 2: So I left Essence at the beginning of March 2014, and I then went to India for six weeks to have my 'Eat, Pray, Love'-moment, and now I am embarking on what is my brand?  What are projects that I will work on that will make a difference?  I'm still gonna be consulting with Essence, which is great.  I'm working on a book project with Kwaku Alston, and this is now the my-moment to develop.  What are Emil Wilbekin projects?  What do I take from all of these incredible learning experiences, and how do I develop the things that I remembered when I looked at that wall in my room in Cincinnati [Ohio] when I was growing up?  And so how do I continue to move culture and give back to the community?
Story_ID: 156525
Speaker 1: What would you like your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: I think my legacy--I would like it to be about a standard of excellence, I would like it to be about moving culture, and I would like to be known for inspiring people--gay people, straight people, men, women--to be their authentic selves in their lives, and to not be afraid to dream, and not then be afraid to achieve those dreams and live those dreams.  And I think that--you know, my life could have been completely different in so many different ways.  You have to have a sense of self in order to live this life, and you have to believe in who you are and it's hard, and I'm just fortunate that my friends, my family believe in me.  And sometimes I think people believe in me more than I believe in myself.  I was in the West Village [New York, New York] this weekend shopping with my best friend, and I went into this boutique, and this young man was a salesperson and he said, "I'm a big fan of your work.  Thank you; please continue to do your work."
Story_ID: 156526
Speaker 1: When you think of your dad [Harvey Wilbekin]--
Speaker 2: Emm.
Speaker 1: --what do you think he would say about you and your life and your work right now?
Speaker 2: I would like to think that my father is very, very proud of me, and that I continue to inspire and do good work, and that everything that he taught me and gave to me I've been able to use, and continue to use.  You know, my mother says that I have surpassed anybody's dreams or expectations of my success, and that's incredible to me.
Speaker 1: And can you tell what your mother [Cleota Proctor Wilbekin] does every day?
Speaker 2: Every morning at seven AM, my mother calls me and she says, "Okay, what are you doing today?  What meetings do you have?  What--" you know, she wants to know everything.  And it's, it's wonderful to have someone that cares and that is there for me--at eighty-three.  Like yesterday, she's like, "This is what you need to read in the [New York] Times today."  I mean it's, it's quite amazing.  And that's the thing; as I look at my mother, who's eighty-three, who has two quilts in the Smithsonian Institute [sic, Smithsonian Institution], who continues to go work at soup kitchens and do her social work and do all these amazing things--at eighty-three.  So I got big shoes to fill; I've got really big shoes to fill.
Story_ID: 156527
Speaker 1: Emil, we talked a bit about your family before but I'd love to talk more about your family--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --starting with your mom [Cleota Proctor Wilbekin].  You--I'd, I'd like you to re-introduce us to your mother.
Speaker 2: My mother has a very, very larger-than-life personality; when you meet her, you realize that this is a woman of great substance, of great style, and a woman of purpose, and she has done everything--you name it.  She graduated from high school when she was fifteen because she was a child prodigy, she played the piano, she excelled in her academics, she was on the tennis team, and this is, you know, this is in the '40s [1940s], and so this was really, really who she was.  She always excelled at every single thing that she did.  And what's wonderful about her is that she shares that brilliance with everybody and everything that she touches, so at age eighty-three, she is in numerous civic and social organizations, she works at a soup kitchen once a week, she makes quilts for prenatal care in Cincinnati [Ohio], and she's constantly, constantly traveling and making these beautiful quilts which is kind of her, I guess, third act where she has become an artist, and so she's made these beautiful quilts where she takes found objects from our family, so it could be a piece of her wedding dress, a piece of a shirt, you know, from high school that I used to love, one of my father's [Harvey Wilbekin] ties, and she takes all these fabrics and creates these beautiful quilts that are not what you would think of if you think of Gee's Bend [Quilts of Gee's Bend] or other types of quilts; hers is much more seen through the lens of fashion, and is, is much more kind of in your face.  So, she uses a lot of tropical print fabrics to reference St. Croix [U.S. Virgin Islands] where my father's from, and then she has pieces of fabric that are from Missouri and Kewanee, Illinois where our family is from--the other side of the family is from.  But what's brilliant about my mother is that, you know, she grew up in Des Moines, Iowa, she moved to New York [New York], she went to, she went to Drake University in Des Moines [Iowa], she moved to New York and went to Teachers College [later, Barnard College of Columbia University, New York, New York], and met my father here in New York, and through all of this, became a doctorate in sociology, received her J.D. [degree], was an administrative law judge for the State of Ohio, and is, I believe, the first black woman to pass the bar in the State of Ohio.  So, she has a very, very rich and illustrious, and kind of--almost powerful history and background, and then she's this beautiful, fashionable, over-the-top, brilliant woman who still plays the organ at church, goes to the soup kitchen, and is always trying to help people in the community.  So, my mother has been very, very instrumental in who I am as a person of, you know, faith, of being someone who's full of grace, and someone who lives in gratitude because that's the way that I was raised, and that's how my mother is, so I don't really know any other way to be, but it's something that I strive to continue 'cause I think it's a great legacy.
Speaker 1: What is your mother's name?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Dr. Cleota P. Wilbekin.
Speaker 1: And do you know where the name Cleota came from?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't; we--she thinks it's the worst name ever.  She just thinks it's like this old timey name; I believe that it is derived from a family name, but it's kind of a hybrid.  But yeah, she's like, "Who would come up with that name?"  But that's, that's her name.
Story_ID: 156528
Speaker 1: And the, the quilts--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Where did the inspiration come for her [Wilbekin's mother, Cleota Proctor Wilbekin] to start making quilts?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: Well, she, she learned--growing up, my mother learned needle point and crocheting and quilting; it was just part of Girl Scouts, part of what, you know, you learned at Sunday school and things like that.  My grandmother [Julia Proctor] did it, my aunts did it, and so it was passed on generation-to-generation, so she always did needle point or some type of hand crafts.  The quilting started after she retired, and I think it was a way for her to express herself.  She, she called me one day, after my father [Harvey Wilbekin] passed away, and said, "I wanna become an artist; what should I do?"  And I'm like, "Okay."  I was like, "Well, in my eyes, you're already an artist."  But I sent her this book called 'The Artist's Way' [Julia Cameron]; she said she kind of read it, she got it, she did some of the workshop--worksheets and, and some of it, but she said she got it.  And the next thing I know, she made a vestment robe for our minister at church, and then she joined the Women's--Women of Color Quilters Network, and that quilt is now in the Smithsonian Institute [sic, Smithsonian Institution].  And she now has these--has all these different quilts that go all over the world, traveling in different exhibitions.  And I think for her, she, she takes pieces of fabric and tells the story through, through, through fashion and through color, and through kind of a--an unique juxtaposition of traditional fabrics--very fashionable fabrics, and then very tropical and African print fabrics.  So she has a quilt that's hanging in the Red Rooster that she made for [HM] Marcus Samuelsson; he has two of her quilts--actually he has three of her quilts.  So she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Wait, what do they look like?
Speaker 2: The one quilt that my mother made--she wanted to tell Marcus' story from Africa to Sweden to America, and so she basically, in her own creative way, built this quilt that is--it's rectangular and long and has, you know, African fabrics that represent the African part, and then I had to remind her to put a red rooster on there at some point, and she did that.  But she just--she created it for a space in Red Rooster without Marcus' permission, and just made it for him, and I was like, "Mom, he may not like it, he may not hang it."  He opened it up, fell in love with it, hung it the next day, and he just recently switched it out because she made an apron for him, and so it is patchwork and piecework of different fabrics and things like that, and Marcus got it framed and it's hanging in Red Rooster now.
Speaker 1: Wow.  Did, did any of that rub off on you--the handwork?
Speaker 2: You know, handwork is not really my thing; I'm more of--into visual art and painting.  When I was in kindergarten, I actually won third place in an art fair at school, and it was really funny because my--I gave the painting to my best friends--I still have it.  It's a black oil painting with different color hibiscus flowers painted over the black and, you know, for someone in kindergarten, that's pretty advanced.  So, you know, my father was an architectural engineer, so line drawing and things like that were part of his craft and trade.  And then with my mom, she just always had this very fashionable, creative personality, so I think that rubbed off on me as well, so they were very, very supportive of me in the arts and drawing and painting, and I wanted to do fashion design at one point, so I did illustration, but they've always encouraged me to keep art and culture alive in whatever I did.
Story_ID: 156529
Speaker 1: You mentioned that your mother [Cleota Proctor Wilbekin] currently belongs to a number of social and civic organizations, and I wanna go back for--when you were a child--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --what was she involved in and what were you involved in?  Like were you in Jack and Jill [of America, Inc.]?  Was she in the Links [The Links, Inc.]--any sororities?  You know, what, what was that social scene like for your family?
Speaker 2: So, my mother has always been very social, so she's a life member of--she's a Golden AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority], she's a life member of the Links, she is the historian for the National Bar Association, she was in Top Ladies of Distinction; you name it, she was, she was in the organization.  And then she was very active at church as well, and on different committees and things like that.  So life growing up was very interesting because my mother was very, very busy so, you know, I didn't have the type of mother that, you know, every night when you came home from school dinner was on the table and cooked; it was very much--you know, there were nights where it was like plea--she'd call me like, "Put the TV dinners in, I'm on the way home."  My father [Harvey Wilbekin] worked two jobs because he had his job with the City of Cincinnati and then he also had his law practice, so my brother [Erik Wilbekin] and I learned to be very self-sufficient, but then we also had the neighbors who would look in on us.  It wasn't like we were at home, you know, alone not, you know, not being overseen or anything, but we, we learned to become very independent at a very early age.  The other thing is that we would always spend Saturday with my father all day, and then Sunday night was family worship, and then we would have--like we'd order pizza and watch, you know, 'The Jeffersons' and things like that.  So, we had a lot of family time built into what my parents did, and my mother would often take my brother and I to her club meetings or to work with her so that she could have time with us.  But she was very, very, I think, ahead of the curve; she was a very modern working woman, you know, at a time where a lotta women weren't in the workforce in that way, and they weren't professionals necessarily.
Speaker 1: what did you do with your father on Saturdays?
Speaker 2: So, on Saturday--Saturdays were really great.  So in the mornings, I would have either baseball or Cub Scouts, depending on which day it was--which weekend it was, and then typically we--my father and I would go have lunch afterwards, and then we would go to his law office and I would help in his law office, and we made a deal that I would go to work but I also would get an allowance for being at work 'cause I was doing real work; I was filing, I was answering phones, I was--I re-did his whole filing system for him, and this was like, you know, starting at age like nine; so my father's West Indian so everyone works.  But it was really, really wonderful, those times, because I cherished the fact that I could spend the whole Saturday, my brother [Erik Wilbekin] and I, with my dad, and then that was just our time, and was very rare that we didn't have that time, so that was, that was a real blessing for me growing up because, you know, not only could I spend time with my father and do things that were social and community-based, but then I could actually see him working, and I think that that was very, very impactful on me in terms of my work ethic and, and being professional.
Story_ID: 156530
Speaker 1: You mentioned that you were in the Cub Scouts.
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Were there any other social groups that you were apart of as a child?
Speaker 2: So, growing up, I was, I was in the Cub Scouts, I taught Sunday school for a while.  I grew up Lutheran, so we had confirmation class, which is--was every Saturday morning, I think, for like three months.  I was active in the youth group at church, I was in choir.  In school, I was on the basketball team, Boy--Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts, and then we would go to the Y[MCA, Young Men's Christian Association] in the summer because it was a great way for us to be part of the community without, you know, necessarily--you know, we could have fun, be part of the community, and then my parents [Harvey Wilbekin and Cleota Proctor Wilbekin] would pick us up on their way home from work, so it was great, so I did that.  Then, in high school I was in Jack and Jill, Top Teens, and then a photography club at school, and the modeling club.
Speaker 1: But you didn't join Jack and Jill [of America, Inc.] until high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it--my mother wasn't really into Jack and Jill until--I think she joined for me like it wasn't, you know, her thing necessarily, but she realized that it was a good thing for me, and I became president of our chapter, I would go to the regional chapters, so it was, it was really great for me 'cause it was very social, and I think it was a way for--you know, I went to a mixed high school so I think it was a really good way for me to be around other successful black people and kids, and kind of have friends that, you know--our parents were friends, and a lot of those people I still see to this day and I--we all went to the same colleges, we see--we run in the same social circles now in New York [New York], so--as if--it was good.
Speaker 1: Did you join a fraternity?
Speaker 2: I did not join a fraternity.
Speaker 1: And--an--any reason why?  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: So my father's a Kappa [Alpha Psi Fraternity] and my mother's an AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority].  I didn't like what was going on with fraternities during the time that I was in college.  A lotta people were getting hurt, there was a lotta hazing; it just didn't feel right, and I--it was hard for me, too, because my father was on the second Kappa line at Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia], so there was a lotta pressure for me to pledge, but I've never--you know, I'm not really a group person in that way; I'm much more of an individualist and it--I understand all the brilliance of being in a fraternity sorority and the camaraderie and the support and the lessons that you learn; it just wasn't the right path for me.
Story_ID: 156531
Speaker 1: You have some interesting family members who you've mentioned, and I'd love for you to talk about them; like Dave Winfield for example?
Speaker 2: Yes.  So, Dave Winfield who used to play with the New York Yankees and is a--is, you know, just an all-time, all-star great baseball player, is my mother's [Cleota Proctor Wilbekin] first cousin.  And it was really funny because my mother has been very instrumental in my career in terms of pitching ideas, so when I was interning at the Cincinnati Enquirer one summer, she said, "Oh, your cousin's gonna be in town because the Yankees are playing the Cincinnati Reds; you should call and try to interview him and see if you can get an interview for the Cincinnati Enquirer."  And I'm like, "Mom."  It's like so embarrassing because I'm like, "I can come up with ideas."  But she's like, "No, this is a really good idea."  So I call, he says, "Yes," the paper is, you know, like--can't believe I got Dave Winfield.  But he's a--he's such a really, really wonderful man, and we exchange Christmas cards, and I see him at different social events and we follow each other on Twitter, and he's just a really, really great guy so--yes, we have some pretty famous family members.
Speaker 1: And how did your boss react to--how old were you at this point?
Speaker 2: I mean I was in college so, you know, I was in, you know, late teens.  I think people--people caught on pretty quickly that I was connected into Cincinnati [Ohio] society, but also kind of society-at-large because I would come up with all these really great story ideas that basically I would hear my parents [Harvey Wilbekin and Cleota Proctor Wilbekin] talking about different things at dinner or when we were out with friends, and I was like, this is a great story, we should do this.  And the newspaper liked it because it was actually getting them deeper into the community in a way that they didn't have--they didn't have any other African American reporters who were from Cincinnati who actually knew what was going on in the city.
Speaker 1: Tell me about Scottie Wilbekin.
Speaker 2: So, Scottie Wilbekin, who was just a huge star of the NCAA [National Collegiate Athletic Association] this past year, University of Florida [Gainesville, Florida], is my third cousin, and so his father Swen [ph.] is my father's second cousin.  And it's just a funny thing; my mother called me one night and was like, "Turn the TV on," and I'm like, "Okay."  And she's like, "Do you see this guy, Scottie Wilbekin?  He's playing"--you know, Wilbekin, there's not that many Wilbekins; so she tells me the whole family story and how he's my father's cousin Swen's grandson.  And then it just--he--you know, he took off and he became this superstar, and so suddenly people are like, "Is Scottie Wilbekin related to you?"  And I was like, "If he's a Wilbekin, he's probably related to me."
Speaker 1: And do you know him?
Speaker 2: You know, we've never met, which is the funny thing.  You know, my family, we--we kinda lost our family reunions and things like that over the years; my father's--one of his sisters, Beryl [ph.], actually went and lived with Scottie and his family in Florida after my grandmother [Elizabeth Wilbekin] passed away, so we're--like my mother knows them and my father knew them, but my brother [Erik Wilbekin] and I don't know the children.
Speaker 1: So that's your next story (laughter).
Speaker 2: I know, I know; I have to get that exclusive.
Story_ID: 156532
Speaker 1: So, when you were growing up, you did have family reunions?
Speaker 2: Yeah, growing up we had family reunions on my mother's [Cleota  Proctor Wilbekin] side; we had family reunions every summer, and then my father's [Harvey Wilbekin] side was interesting because being in St. Croix [U.S. Virgin Islands], we would kinda make it family reunion when we would go for Christmas, but then there would be other family reunions 'cause a lot of my relatives live in New York [New York] so--but they were more sporadic, like they weren't kind of regular.  Because the family was so big, I think it was hard to bring everybody together, but then they just--unfortunately, kind of faded and stopped, and it's, it's something I think about like, should I take that on and bring the families back together, because I think it's important.
Story_ID: 156533
Speaker 1: How far back can you trace your mother's [Cleota Proctor Wilbekin] family and your father's [Harvey Wilbekin] family?  Can you go all the way back to slavery?
Speaker 2: My mother's family we can trace back to my mother's grandfather, and she actually has his papers where he was released from the [U.S] Army during the Civil War, and so we, we do have those papers.  Most of my mother's family were former freed slaves that came north and kind of migrated to the West, so a lot in Kewanee, Illinois, Missouri, and then Des Moines, Iowa.  My father's family not so much tied to slavery, but very interesting because St. Croix [U.S. Virgin Islands] was, you know, Danish, so we can trace back probably to my great-grandfather.
Speaker 1: And was he Danish?
Speaker 2: He--well--this is when it gets tricky.  So, my great-grandfather was Danish and my mother was Caribbean--my great-grandmother was Caribbean.  But then they had thirteen kids, so it's, you know this, this very big family.  But my--then my grandfather worked for the telephone company in St. Croix and so everyone on the island knew them because--knew him because to work for the telephone company you're kind of on an island--that's someone you'd wanna know.  So that family lineage is a little harder to kinda trace.
Speaker 1: Well, in, in--as I recall, St. Croix changed a lot of hands; I mean it went through many European countries--
Speaker 2: --Yes, absolutely; so, British, Danish, and then U.S. [United States]--yeah.  So it's, you know, it's, it's a hard--you would think it would be easier because of the history and the records, but it's actually not.
Speaker 1: Is it--do you know any of the Danish people in your family at all?
Speaker 2: You know what?  I, I don't.  I'm--I was on a flight one time and I met this man whose last name was Vivekin [ph.] and--which is basically the Danish pronunciation of Wilbekin, and so my family knew his family and we are like distant cousins, but that was kinda strange.  But I don't know--and he was black, so it was really weird.  So I don't--but I don't know that much of the Danish history; I've never been to Denmark--no.
Story_ID: 156534
Speaker 1: Your growing up--you had a babysitter of, of, of note (laughter).
Speaker 2: Ahh, yes.
Speaker 1: Can you tell--how, how did you come to meet [HM] Nikki Giovanni?
Speaker 2: So, Nikki Giovanni is a family friend, and basically, my mother [Cleota Proctor Wilbekin] and Nikki's mother [Yolanda Cornelia, Sr.] used to work for the State of Ohio together, and so that's how they became friends.  And then I just recently heard the story that my mother's sister was Nikki's sister's [Gary Ann Giovanni] secretary, so there's this kind of interesting circle with Nikki Giovanni.  But I remember growing up and like on a Saturday afternoon my mother was like, "Oh, I'm gonna take you to a book signing," and we went to this bookstore in Cincinnati [Ohio] where Nikki's from, and she was there signing her books and, you know, I just always remember her coming to our house; we always had her books in our house.  You know, I was very young, so my mother's like, "Yeah, she used to babysit you."  Nikki tells the story, when she does public speaking, that she used to babysit me, and she often will send my mother notes and say, "tell your boys I said hello, and that I'm watching them and I'm very, very proud of them."  So, she's a, a really great lady; and we'll write letters back and forth sometimes to each other.  But she's amazing--
Story_ID: 156535
Speaker 1: Growing up in such a--because your, your mom [Cleota Proctor Wilbekin] in particular was such a social person.
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: How did that affect your entry into society say, there, in Cincinnati [Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Well, it was funny because my mother was so entrenched in kind of the social scene in Cincinnati; I didn't really wanna be a part of it.  I mean I did things--you know, I, I was in, you know, cotillions and things like that, but it wasn't kind of a priority for me; like I was very much like I wanna be the artistic person and I wanna be the cool person, and so my friends that I grew up with, all of our parents were in the same social circle but we all kind of felt like we were too cool for school and that we didn't wanna be, you know, in Jack and Jill [of America] or all these other organizations.  Our parents were like, "You're gonna go to Jack and Jill."  So we went, and then we decided, "Well, we'll make Jack and Jill cool."  So we kind of took over and, you know, became the officers and just made sure that all the parties were really fun, and it was really cool.  I really, in high school, hung out with older people, so I hung out with, you know, I--it was--I was senior in high school, I was hanging out with college students, and they were friends from Jack and Jill and stuff like that, but they were just older.  So the society thing, it was kind of what it was; it wasn't--it was just my life, like I didn't think, "Oh, I wanna be in the social scene," it's just kind of you, you were a part of it.
Story_ID: 156536
Speaker 1: When, when were you in Jack and Jill [of America]?
Speaker 2: So, I was in Jack and Jill, I think, freshman year in high school [Walnut Hills High School, Cincinnati, Ohio] until I graduated, so that would be like the early '80s [1980s] to the mid-'80s [1980s].  And I think what was really great--the fondest memory I have of Jack and Jill was celebrating Kwanza because every (laughter) year, we would celebrate Kwanzaa and you had to learn about Kwanzaa and then recite a certain aspect of Kwanzaa, and it was just really, really fascinating to me because I thought, well, this is really cool and artistic, and this is also during the time of 'The Cosby Show' and so there was a resurgence in, in the '80s [1980s] of black history and being proud and being political.  So, for me, there was a part of being in Jack and Jill, growing up in Cincinnati [Ohio], which is a majority white city, that it felt powerful and political almost, even though it was very society-based.  I think the thing about Cincinnati that I appreciate, and I should say this, is that the black community there is very, very tight, and they are--a lot of people who have broken through and, and made a big difference in the black community--in the white community, and also made a difference in Cincinnati, and I think that being in Jack and Jill or going to the National Bar [Association] events or Links [The Links, Inc.], or different events with my family, I got to see these black people who were confident, who were successful, who were professionals, and who lived really, really great lives and I think that that is something that, for me, is--kind of helped shape the life that I now have--
Story_ID: 156537
Speaker 1: So, back to Jack and Jill [of America].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You mentioned that--well, the, the fact that you joined so late--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --is unusual; normally, people join at a young age if they can.  And why was it that you joined late?
Speaker 2: My mother [Cleota Proctor Wilbekin]--I think she was just so busy with everything else in her life that that wasn't a real priority.  I think she saw, you know, an opportunity that I was social, like this would be good for me to kind of be in this, this organization that was a social and civic organization, and we would do all these great things and I would travel and be around other African American children who, you know, were of well-to-do families, so I think for her it was, you know--I went to this high school [Walnut Hills High School, Cincinnati, Ohio], this public college prep high school that, you know, was probably maybe thirty percent black, so I think it was a way for me to be entrenched in the community.
Speaker 1: That's interesting because at the point of high school, that's when people say that's the pay-off--
Speaker 2: Emm.
Speaker 1: --if you can get your kids to stay in--
Speaker 2: Emm, emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --then, as you described, participating in the regionals and etcetera, is very helpful to build your self-confidence and--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --for you, because you were very active and, and you said that you and your friends decided to make it hip.
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: What did you do to change Jack and Jill so it fit what you wanted it to be?
Speaker 2: Well, basically, my best friend Holly Poole [ph.], from high school--you know, we were like, we're gonna go to the meetings, we are going to--we weren't disruptive but we were like, let's do cool things; like if we're gonna do a community project, let's do a cool community project.  If we're going to have a dance, let's make sure we have the right DJ [deejay, disk jockey], that there's a theme, so we kinda brought flavor, I guess, to our Jack and Jill chapter, and it was great because then when I went to regionals, a lot of my friends from the National Bar Association were also in my Jack and Jill regional chapter, so I would get to see them, you know, in Detroit [Michigan] or St. Louis [Missouri], or wherever the conventions were.  So we just wanted to be cool; like I mean if you think about 'The Cosby Show,' we wanted to be, you know, Theo [Huxtable played by HM Malcolm-Jamal Warner] and Lisa [Bonet who played Denise Huxtable] and, you know, everybody.  We wanted to be cool and relevant and fashionable within that context.  So, we kind of elevated (laughter) our Jack and Jill chapter.
Story_ID: 156538
Speaker 1: When you, when you move to New York [New York]--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --what, what I'm interested in is how your social circle kind of--the way you had your social construct at home--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --how, how did you form your social construct in New York?
Speaker 2: When I moved to New York, I think a lot of my social construct was taken from Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] because there's so many New Yorkers who are Hamptonians, so I had this built-in kind of entree into New York because I had all these friends from Hampton that lived in New York and were gonna return home in New Jersey and worked in the city, so that was really great.  I also had--I made really good friends at Columbia [University Graduate School of] Journalism [New York, New York] school with the other black students in my journalism classes, but then I also ended up meeting some students from the other international schools who kind of then took me out to nightclubs and parties and things that, you know, I had no idea, you know, were happening or going on.  But a lotta my friends from Hampton, you know, would take me to music industry events and, and parties that, you know, as a college student, you would never kind of get to go to, and especially someone from Cincinnati [Ohio] who just came from Hampton; like my mind was blown, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Like what?  Can you tell me some (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Oh, my gosh!  I mean the big party was [Kool DJ] Red Alert's birthday party at the Red Parrot which, you know, everyone in the music industry was there.  My big sister at Hampton is Jocelyn Cooper, so--you know, her father runs the--ran the black paper in Brooklyn [New York, New York], the City Sun, and so she was very connected, and so she would invite me out to different things, and then I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--She was a major player in the music industry at that time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--She was a huge player; she found D'Angelo.  So--so I--you know, my mother [Cleota Proctor Wilbekin] says that I'm always at the right place at the right time, but I'd have to say I was really, really blessed to come to New York and kind of already know people that were here, and then the rest was kind of built around work; I think built around the magazines that I worked at, and then at Vibe I had the great fortune of being the new talent editor when I--when the magazine first started.  So, I ran the Next section, and everyone that was in the Next section at the beginning of Vibe, by the time I became editor-in-chief, were then cover-worthy, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Like who?
Speaker 2: So--Maxwell.  A friend of mine worked in the music industry, was like, "I want you to hear this music;" he brought me this cassette tape.  I loved the music.  It was this young guy that worked at Coffee Shop and it was Maxwell, and so we did a story about him in the magazine before he even signed a record deal.
Story_ID: 156539
Speaker 1: I didn't realize he [Maxwell] worked at Coffee Shop.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he used to work at Coffee Shop.
Speaker 1: Can you, can you describe what Coffee Shop has meant?--
Speaker 2: --Coffee Shop has been really great for models and for, for a lot of entertainment people.  Basically, people went there and waited tables and bused tables and things like that, but it was a place where people kind of went to find beautiful people and talent, so a lotta models came from there, a lot of actors and actresses came from there, and Maxwell used to wait tables there.
Speaker 1: And Coffee Shop is in Union Square (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yes.
Speaker 1: --in Manhattan [New York].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And who were some of the other people who became famous who worked there?
Speaker 2: Oh, my gosh!  We're gonna have to google that.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Like Feena [ph.], model (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: --she was there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I know--there's a, there's a lotta people, yeah.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--There are quite a few, yes, yes.
Speaker 2: There's a lot; I just would have to--yeah.
Speaker 1: That's okay.  And so anyhow, Maxwell was one of those people, and you did--you said you did the story before his album came out?
Speaker 2: Yes; so Maxwell was one of those people.  Mary J. Blige was one of those people.  OutKast, we featured.  I mean you name it--Aaliyah, Brandy; like all these artists were covered in the New Talent section of Vibe, so I met Usher; like I met Usher when he was sixteen years old, and luckily (laughter), I made a great impression and people remembered me, and then, because I rose to the ranks at Vibe, I stayed friendly with a lot of these people.
Speaker 1: Now, how did you meet them?  Because as the new talent editor, your job was to spot talent.
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: So what were you doing?  Where were you going?  Who were you talking to, to even identify the new talent?
Speaker 2: I would say a lot of my career success has been built on relationships, so the one thing that I was clear about when I became the new talent editor was to make sure that I was friendly with all the young publicists who were also just out of school, so Chris Chambers, Jana Fleishman, Wendy Washington--all of these people I was friendly with--I still am friendly with.  And so people would send me talent, and then when people knew that I had that job, they would bring me cassette tapes or send their cousin to see me.  And then I was just always out looking for new talent.  If I was at a club and I saw someone perform, if I read about someone in the Village Voice, I would want to really make a connection with those people on a human level.  But I've just--I loved when I could find artists that had really great differentiating work and, you know, I was lucky to do that.
Speaker 1: So, what time period are we looking at now, when you were doing the new talent, having that as your role, and where were you going?  What clubs were you going to?
Speaker 2: Oh, my gosh.  So, this was in 1992 in New York City [New York].  What clubs was I going to?  I mean I was going everywhere; I would go to the Tunnel, I was going to Limelight; you kinda name it and I was there.  I mean I, I ran the streets when I was young, and wherever things were happening, I wanted to go, but I was also very lucky that I would do the music scene, I would go to Fashion Week, and then I would go to cultural events because that's kind of, you know, my history and my life.  So I kinda was everywhere, and then being everywhere you just kind of meet new people along the way.
Story_ID: 156540
Speaker 1: Sometimes people deliver people to my doorstep and were like, "Can you look out for my daughter?  She's moving here from Jamaica; look out for her."  And that was Nicola Vassell.  So--and then I just was just lucky (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--So who is Nicola Vassell?
Speaker 1: So, Nicola Vassell was a young model who now is this amazing curator; she just had a huge show called Black Eye that featured some of the most prominent African American artists of our time, Kehinde Wiley, Wangechi Mutu, Mickalene Thomas; you name it, they were featured in the show.  What's brilliant about Nicola is she knew that she's--she was a successful model, but she knew that there's a shelf life for that, so she was interested in art, she went back to school, she started studying art, and then she got a job with Jeffrey Deitch, who is one of the preeminent modern art curators and gallery owners of our time.  And so, while she was there, Kehinde Wiley was with Jeffrey Deitch.  Jeffrey Deitch did shows for like Jeff Koons, Terry Richardson--like very formidable modern artists.  And so Nicky [ph.] was right there in the mix and, and then she went to work for the Pace Gallery for a couple of years, and it was a little bit more corporate than Jeffrey Deitch, and so then she wanted to start her own business and make her own way, and so now she's doing Black Eye and curating shows that will travel around the country and hopefully around the world.
Story_ID: 156541
Speaker 1: So you're at Vibe--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --out and about (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --spotting talent.  How--when did your--when did you change roles?  You went from new talent editor to what?
Speaker 2: So, I--so I was--when I was associate editor, I was the new--on the test issue, I edited the front of the book and the back of the book section, so very short section news focused.  When we launched the test issue--after the test issue, they said, "Oh, you, you really have a good eye and ear for new talent."  I always wanna cover what's new; I think it's very, very interesting.  I mean I think yes, you wanna cover legends and icons, but it's always interesting about what's next and who's gonna change culture.  So they said, "We have this new job for you," and I'm like, "Okay."  It's less real estate (laughter), you know, than I was editing before, but I didn't realize it was such important real estate to really pick those four or five people who would really help define the magazine in many ways because, you know, we would have the icons on the cover and features on other people, but that new talent section was really important because as hip hop was changing and developing and, and birthing at this point, music and what was next was really, really important because the sound and the music like jazz, like blues before it, was the voice of African American culture, and so who are these new people that are shaping that voice and, and, and then in turn the culture?  So, you know, things just happen to me in my life that are, are very cool like--so I went from associate editor doing new talent, and then I decided I wanted to move into fashion, and so I became style editor, and the first cover that I was ever assigned was the Biggie [Smalls also known as Notorious B.I.G.] and Faith [Evans] cover where they're sitting in the blue Cadillac on the Brooklyn [New York, New York] waterfront, and that is an iconic picture, and so that was the first cover that I ever styled.  The first fashion shoot that I ever styled was Tyson Beckford, which you can't go wrong, and, and that--those photos are in a Coffee Table book that Christian Witkin took those photos, and those photos are in a Coffee Table book now.
Speaker 1: So, doing Biggie and Faith Evans--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --and even just in general, the people who were cover subjects were not model-size people.
Speaker 2: Emm-emm.
Speaker 1: So, doing fashion for Biggie (laughter), where did you go?
Speaker 2: Doing fashion for Biggie before we were in an era of big and tall men's shops.  So, part of it--there was Rochester Big and Tall in the Rockefeller Center, so that was my first stop; but then it's like going and pitching to them 'cause they're like, who is this guy?  Then, Karl Kani had a big and tall line.  And then I just did styling tricks like--I had been to the Comme des Garcons show in Paris [France] and I was like, "They have these gigantic oversize coats, and they happened to work thrown on Biggy's shoulders because the whole theme was kind of a Pulp Fiction theme, so--but it wasn't, it wasn't an easy shoot, like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--And Comme de Garcons said, "Yes."
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: So, that's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --wouldn't always be true either.
Speaker 2: No.  But it was hard; I mean it was hard.  And then Puffy [Sean "Diddy" Combs] was involved, so that was hard because he's very, very decisive and clear about what he wants, and he showed up on the set and we we're shooting in Dumbo [Brooklyn, New York, New York], and he didn't like a lotta the clothes, and I had to run out with Groovey Lew in the car and try to find other clothes.
Story_ID: 156542
Speaker 1: So, what was Groovey Lew's role at that point?  Was he working with Puffy [Sean "Diddy" Combs], or was he--
Speaker 2: He was working with Puffy and he was, you know, part artist development and part styling.
Speaker 1: Right.  So, I'd like you to talk about that a little bit, but just the role of a fashion editor working with a celebrity stylist--
Speaker 2: Emm.
Speaker 1: --can be challenging, to say the least.
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: So--now he, he--Groovey Lew is a nice guy, but what was that--what was your relationship like and what is that relationship like for a fashion editor working with a celebrity stylist?
Speaker 2: I think celebrity stylists now are much more powerful than I think they were in the beginning of my career.  So, for me, it was odd that there was a celebrity stylist; like I'm like, okay.  Fortunately, Groovey [Lew] liked the shoots that I had done, thought it was so cool that I worked at Vibe, so it was easy; like we were more like we wanna make this work, and this is like--I mean Biggie [Smalls, also known as Notorious B.I.G.] was like--I mean he was more than a 4XL; like he was a massive man.  So, it was like, okay, we have to get this done.  And we jumped in a car and we rode all over the city, and then we came back and, you know, he's wearing all black, of course, and we did it, and we finished the shoot at night and I was exhausted and I was like, why did you choose this career path?  'Cause I literally thought I was gonna lose my mind.  But, you know, I think--the thing about styling is you're always problem-solving.  I think now, celebrity stylists have so much more power and cache over the artist; it's really, really tricky, from a magazine point of view, to have a point of view because the celebrity stylist comes in and they're like, you wear this, you wear this, you wear that; a lot of the celebrities listen to that and unless you're, you know, Vogue or Vanity Fair, you don't really have much of a say.
Story_ID: 156543
Speaker 1: As, as a new magazine--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --that, that you were--that Vibe was able to borrow from a Comme des Garcons and therefore, I'm sure, many other of the top designers, would not be a given, especially a new magazine that is urban which, to them, would mean black; I mean--I, I remember at Essence--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --which had a huge following, it was often difficult to even get a market appointment.  How did you negotiate building those relationships?
Speaker 2: I think what was very brilliant about the way that Vibe was launched is that fashion was always a big component of its DNA so yes, it was music, but it was also fashion and lifestyle that went with the music.  And I think, you know, having Giorgio Armani who loaned us clothes for the first issue, having a fashion shoot in the first issue with Naomi Campbell wearing Versace, it kinda set the bar that this is a magazine that covers fashion, but is about fashion and is about style, and I think that that made a big difference.  Also, we had proper fashion departments, we went to the shows in Europe, we had really strong fashion salespeople, and it was not always easy by any means, but I mean I remember as editor-in-chief going to shows in Milan [Italy] and fighting about a front-row seat because it's--the protocol is that editor-in-chiefs sit on the front row.  And so if I wasn't sitting on the front row, then I wanted to know why I wasn't sitting on the front row.  And, and sometimes I told them, I can't come to the show because--then, and we won't cover you.  But it was, it was a battle and it was strategic, and I think though because then hip hop became so integral to fashion.  If you think about the golden era of hip hop, so '96 [1996], and you think of what Puffy [Sean "Diddy" Combs] was doing about bling and, you know, Dolce and Gabbana, and Tom Ford for Gucci, were showing clothing that literally was based off of hip hop looks.  And then you in turn--
Speaker 1: --Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Karl Lagerfeld for Chanel, Versace; everybody was doing these clothes that were--you know, it was a give and take; it was inspired by hip hop but hip hop was inspired by the original looks, and you think about Louis Vuitton and Chanel and all these brands, so we made it our business to be there, so we went to Europe to the shows, we went to all the events, we photographed the clothes in the magazine, but it wasn't easy.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Who's we?  Who's we?
Speaker 2: Oh, we--the we of eth--of--the we of Vibe; there's so many people, so many amazing, talented people.  [HM] Michaela Angela Davis, Stephon Campbell--geez--(unclear); oh, my God--Kevin Stewart.  I mean there were so many amazing, talented people that, that worked at Vibe in fashion who are still amazing, reputable people.  So, I think that was it, too; it was like breaking down, you know, a lotta barriers and demanding respect.  But that was also part of hip hop.  But then, you know, what we also realize is a lot of the publicists, the fashion publicists, were hip hop fans, so we'd take them to parties with us, and we took celebrities to Milan [Italy] to the fashion shows with us, so one year we took Tupac [Shakur], one year we took--[HM] Quincy Jones came with us, Usher went one year; I mean--so we literally brought the culture to Milan.
Speaker 1: And that guaranteed many front row seats (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, sometimes you got less 'cause they're like, ahh, well Quincy's on the front row, so--then you--you're like, okay, it's Quincy, I'll sit on the second row.
Story_ID: 156544
Speaker 1: One of the things that happened in fashion during that time is there was also a backlash--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --you know.  I remember Timberland.
Speaker 2: Emm.
Speaker 1: You know, every hip hop artist pretty much was wearing Timbs [Timberland boots], and then they decided that they were gonna take the stores out of the black neighborhoods--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm, emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --and Tommy Hilfiger--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --at first was giving tons of fashion to people in hip hop--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm, emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --and then there was a reversal--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --at least for a minute.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did, did Vibe cover those stories?
Speaker 2: We covered the, the different stories that were going on around fashion.  The thing about Vibe and, and definitely under my tenure, but it was part of--always part of its DNA, was to cover the culture of the music and the lifestyle of the music, so fashion fit into that, so as news stories--it's a delicate dance when people are advertisers, but a lotta times as news, we would cover things, you know, and that's, that's always interesting with your editorial teams and your business side teams when they're like, what are you guys doing?  But you still had to have journalistic integrity at the end of the day, so we did cover those types of things.  In fact, I wrote a story that talked about kind of the marriage of hip hop and fashion, and it talks about a lotta those things, like that it hasn't been like this beautiful dance all the time either.  So we did cover those things from a feature perspective in the magazine.
Story_ID: 156545
Speaker 1: From--just the, the, the tremendous ascent of hip hop, and you mentioned Puffy [Sean "Diddy" Combs] and he's certainly integral--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --to that.  During that time--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --I think very strategically, he put himself in every music video--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and there were people who complained that he was being narcissistic but in the end it made him an international celebrity.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How did Vibe cover his ascent?
Speaker 2: Well, Puffy has always been Puffy, so he is gonna get what he wants, and he is also going to give you his story in a very interesting way.  So, when the first issue of Vibe came out, he's like, "I need to be in the magazine."  And he gave Scott Poulson-Bryant access and, again, covering what--what and who was next was very important to us, so we kind of called that, and were correct in him becoming this, this hot-shot; like he's the guy that was going to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] and taking the train to go intern at Uptown [Records], he's the one that found the Mary J. Blige tape in the bin that was thrown out.  I mean he really had a vision, and so we covered him a lot obviously; he was very integral to the early stages of hip hop, especially as it ascended into the golden era.  It was also then very challenging when there was drama with East Coast/West Coast and things like that because, you know, explaining to a businessman journalistic integrity didn't really--you know, he didn't like that very much.  But I would have to say that when I have worked with Puffy on shoots and stories for Vibe, I've never worked with anybody more dedicated, who pushed the levels of creativity and wanting to create something that was iconic, wanting to really push everybody; and it's definitely not an easy shoot or an easy task, but then you come out with these images and you're like, okay, now I get it.
Speaker 1: I remember at a Vibe event--because what--one thing that Vibe did was not just have the magazine, but there were many events--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --that were part of it.  And then in the early days, I went to a Vibe event where he spoke--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and talked about sitting at the feet of [HM] Russell [Simmons] and Andre [Harrell]--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --Russell Simmons and Andre Harrell to learn.
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Did you talk to him at all about those--about, about how he grew his career?
Speaker 2: You know, it's funny; I think with Puffy that our, our paths are very parallel, so I kind of saw everything happening.  It wasn't about--I mean he and I have been friendly over the years and, and vacation and things like that, but again, I've always just seen him push the boundaries, like I always feel kind of inadequate (laughter) when I think of the things that he's done and that he continues to do.  He definitely talks about that, and talks about Andre and Russell really guide-- guiding him, but I think he's really smart; like he really studied music, he really studied industry executives and, and created who he is by taking the best of everything, and I think that that's pretty phenomenal.
Story_ID: 156546
Speaker 1: So, in looking at hip hop culture--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --as it was growing very quickly--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --so there's music, there's fashion, you know, you--like sex, drugs, rock and roll.
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm, emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And fashion was a big part of that, but also on the fringes and not--and sometimes right in the middle, there was a lot of violence; I mean many of the people, especially rappers--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --many of them were criminals--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --I mean--convicted criminals.
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: What--did you work with any of those people?  And did you, did you--were you ever afraid?  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  Yes.  You know, working at Vibe during that period which, you know, would span from the early '90s [1990s] into early 2000, was very, very tumultuous.  There was a lotta crime, there was the whole East Coast/West Coast battle where, you know, we lost Tupac [Shakur] and we lost Biggie [Smalls, also known as Notorious B.I.G.].  So, yeah; I mean I'm the bougie [bourgeoisie] kid from Cincinnati [Ohio] who was in Jack and Jill [of America] so suddenly, you know, I'm at the Bronx [New York, New York] at this party, and I'm like, okay.  Now, thankfully, I never was beaten up, I never witnessed anyone getting beaten up, I've never, thank God, been where there was gunfire, which was a real blessing, but there were definitely moments, like at photo-shoots, where you're like, this could go really wrong.  And I think that's when you have to be a human and you have to say, okay, I need to negotiate this situation, because, you know, at that point, too, as an editor, this is my staff and people that I've hired to come here, and I have to manage and protect this situation.  Also, it's my job.  Like I cannot have--you know, someone shooting a gun at a photoshoot is not a good idea.  I will say that a lotta people, when they came to work for--with Vibe, like at a photoshoot and things like that, I do think that a lotta people brought a certain level of respect, that they wouldn't show out there.  Now, yes, Biggie was killed outside of a Vibe event which, to me, was completely shocking and scary.
Speaker 1: When was that?
Speaker 2: That was--and I should know the exact date [March 9, 1997].  I'd have to check the exact (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Do you remember what year?
Speaker 2: It's--Biggie would be--I think it's--I wanna say '96 [1996, sic, 1997]; I'd have to check.  I wanna say '96 [1996].
Speaker 1: It's around that time.
Speaker 2: It's around that time.  And--but, you know, people would try to show off in the office or do--we just never tolerated that type of behavior, so I think people kind of knew not to kinda show out, but if you're at an industry event that you don't have control over, things can happen.
Speaker 1: Did, did Vibe have security guards in the office?  And what was the security situation there?
Speaker 2: You know, at Vibe, I think--there were times where we had security (laughter) 'cause we, we felt like we needed it, but for the most part, no.  We always had a very savvy receptionist, we had key cards that let people in and out.  We didn't have a lotta drama.  Like once in a while, someone would show up and you're like, why are they walking the floor right now?  Like, how did they get in here?  But nothing was ever not managed.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Like who?
Speaker 2: Like Puffy [Sean "Diddy" Combs] (laughter) would show up, you know, and--I think when I became editor-in-chief, what I can speak to is that I dealt with a lot of the artists' managers and publicists directly, and I think that makes a huge difference; I think when you--you have to have integrity, you have to tell people what's going on, and once you manage situations in that way, then it's much easier.
Story_ID: 156547
Speaker 1: When were you editor-in-chief [of Vibe]?
Speaker 2: I was editor-in-chief from 1999 until 2002.
Speaker 1: And who owned the magazine when you were editor-in-chief?
Speaker 2: When I was editor-in-chief, Bob Miller, who used to high-up at Time Inc. and helped launch Vibe with Time Inc. Ventures, and Warner Brothers had bought the magazine from Time Inc., so he was the owner at that time.
Speaker 1: So, [HM] Keith [Clinkscales] and Len [HM Leonard Burnett, Jr.] never owned Vibe.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: They, they just--they had--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --their, their (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Publisher and CEO [chief executive officer].
Speaker 1: So, as a business--now, obviously you're on the editorial side but you see the, the business--how the business is working.  What--because Vibe told stories differently than other so-called black magazines, I mean they, they told it all in a way that was completely atypical of traditional black magazines.
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Did--was there ever conflict between the business side and the editorial side based upon the kinds of stories that you were telling and cover subjects that you selected?
Speaker 2: We always had conflict with editorial versus publishing and business.  I mean I think that that is the very nature of magazines, and especially a magazine that was born out of Time Inc., which is so about church and state, and at a time where that ethos was really, really upheld.  I think the lines are very blurred now because we live in a very different world and people need money.  So--but there was a lotta challenges about, you know, business decisions versus editorial decisions.  We did a story about MTV and literally were black-balled from anything MTV for years because we basically said that they were kind of racist and not necessarily uplifting people in their programming, and no VMAs [MTV Video Music Awards] for us.  So these types of things happen, and it happened across the board; and you also have to realize that when you have high-profile people who are on the publishing side and the editorial side, the lines were often blurred to the outside world about who was in charge of what.  It was like, "Oh, you're all Vibe."  But outside people don't know that--well, in our construct, business doesn't dictate editorial, and editorial should do what it wants to do but does have to sway in certain times.  So it was--there was a lotta that, and I think the other thing to keep in mind about Vibe was it was a very young staff.  Most people that worked at Vibe, that was their first job outta school.  So, you have a whole--like a majority of a staff that's never worked anywhere and suddenly they're working in this corporate structure that--and you want the kids that were into music and knew hip hop and knew the difference between the different genres of rap music and stuff like that.  They're not gonna be great with doing their T&E [travel and expenses], they're not gonna be great in protocol and meetings.  So a lotta the work that I would say the editors did at Vibe was mentorship because there was a lotta teaching and grooming.  Of course, Keith and Len had gone to business school, of course I went to Columbia J. School [Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, New York, New York].  I mean we had people there that had higher education obviously, but most people hadn't worked anywhere else; a lotta people had worked at the Village Voice and other places, but many of the young staff never worked anywhere else before, so that also made it challenging.
Story_ID: 156548
Speaker 1: Now I sometimes think about Vibe in a way that Interview [magazine]--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --was created because there was Andy Warhol's pack--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --of friends who then helped him to make the magazine, and they became friends; they were enmeshed in the culture.
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Vibe--I mean I remember seeing all of the editors at, you know, Puffy's [Sean "Diddy" Combs] house, at [HM] Russell's [Simmons] house, at--friends, or appearing to be friends, and so when you--when your lives become enmeshed, I'm curious to know how did that affect the storytelling?
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Because, you know, these are powerful people who probably only wanted certain kinds of stories to be told, but that's not the kinda story--Vibe didn't put those boundaries on.
Speaker 2: I think that the lines between kind of journalism and celebrity became more blurred later on into the growth of Vibe.  I think in the very beginning--here's the thing that was really challenging in the beginning.  In the beginning, the whole fundamental premise of Vibe was that it would be what Rolling Stone was to rock 'n' roll, it would be to hip hop and R&B.  So in that, you think amazing journalism and story-telling, really striking and memorable images, and things like that.  The biggest thing in the beginning that was so hard for us to negotiate was everyone would call [HM] Quincy [Jones].  If people had a problem with anything, they would call Quincy Jones.  So then Quincy's calling us, so it turned into this real like dance of like, okay, and--you know, we, we finally, over years, figured out how to kind of manage that because people were always gonna call Quincy; you can't do anything about it.
Speaker 1: What would he do after he received these calls?
Speaker 2: He would then call us.  So it was just like your dad's calling, or your grandfather, or your uncle's calling.  And, you know--and we were always respectful; it's Quincy Jones.  But there was always--that was, I think, a very hard thing to negotiate in the very beginning because everybody would just run to Quincy.  So it was a bit of a education for Mr. Jones, too, of--this is a magazine, this is kind of journalistic integrity, and things like that.  So back to your question.  I think as we grew up with the culture, it got more challenging later in our career than in the beginning.  In the beginning, it was kind of Wild Wild West and we were creating something very different.  Like any business, the more money, the more advertising, the bigger prestige, the bigger the celebrities, then it became a real nuance of having to explain to people like we have to tell both sides of the story.
Story_ID: 156549
Speaker 1: I wanna go back to that first issue again.  You mentioned that Naomi Campbell was in the issue wearing Versace, right?
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Now, at this point--what, what year is this?
Speaker 2: Ninety-two [1992].
Speaker 1: So, '92 [1992]--Naomi Campbell was the biggest model in the world.
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: How did you all get her to be in the magazine?
Speaker 2: Call [HM] Quincy [Jones] (laugher).
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: And, as a result of having her--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --what, what then happened in terms of getting other people like her?
Speaker 2: Well, I think having Naomi Campbell in the first issue, along with LL Cool J and other, you know, Puffy [Sean "Diddy" Combs], like all these big people, I think what it did was it, it made people take us very seriously and it made other people want to be in the magazine.  Models was always challenging because, you know, a lot of the black models, the agents don't want them necessarily to be in black magazines.  I think for me it was a great fortune, and most of us, we either were friends with them, so we could get them, or we were friends with their agents and things like that, and just kinda worked it out.  But it was--you know, having Naomi was--it was good to have that big marquee presence, obviously, in the test issue.  And you needed that sexy factor; you needed that glam factor, and she really brought that.
Speaker 1: And at that point, she was even more than a model; she had become a celebrity.
Speaker 2: Absolutely--yeah.  So it was, it was a coup to get her.
Speaker 1: Was there anybody that you attempted to get for a cover who wouldn't do it?
Speaker 2: Hmm.  I mean honestly, I can't think of anybody that, that wouldn't do it.  I wouldn't--it wasn't always easy (laughter) getting people as, as, you know.  Yeah, I don't think that there was anyone that we--that said no.
Speaker 1: Who would you say was the biggest get that you got?
Speaker 2: I mean, for me, Michael Jackson.  I think anytime you got Michael Jackson, that was huge.
Speaker 1: At what point in his career did you--
Speaker 2: I mean this was like maybe--tryin' to think of what year this was.  There was early 2000, 2002.  So still, you know, shot him at Neverland [Ranch].
Speaker 1: Who shot him?
Speaker 2: Someone he approved (laughter).  That was a big coup, and it was also--you know, we did interesting things, too.  There were surprise people, as I've been going through archives recently, like Justin Timberlake was on the cover, Jennifer Lopez was on the cover, you know.  And you go back and--Hollywood didn't work so well for us, so we did have, in the beginning, a lot of actors and stuff, but people wanted music from Vibe.  So there were, you know, occasional people that could work, but music just worked every time.
Story_ID: 156550
Speaker 1: So, the great thing about being editor-in-chief of a magazine is that you also get to do whatever you wanna do.  So, the one thing--I had become so associated with the fashion in Vibe, with the advertisers, with the community. It was hard to let that piece go because--keeping the standard up, but also people wanted what I did, so it was tricky.  Obviously, I couldn't do style shoots every issue, and then also I wanted to groom other people to, to take over, but it was great; like at least twice a year I could do a fashion shoot.  And then, covers being so challenging with sales and what you need, and newsstand and that.  I was like, I have to be at the shoot anyway?  I'm just gonna style them.  So I didn't, I didn't do all of them, but I did a lot of them as editor-in-chief, which was a lot; but again, if I have to be at the shoot anyway, I had a whole fashion department that would pull everything.
Speaker 2: I was gonna ask, you shopped the market, too?
Speaker 1: Well, there were things that I definitely would want for a specific look, because I was at, I was at the shows so it's like, oh, I love this, I love that.  It also gave a certain level of respect and--to the magazine because people couldn't show out 'cause it's like, well, the editor-in-chief's here and he's styling; I can't really--like I kinda--we kinda have to do what he wants to do.  And it was hard because some celebrities didn't, you know, want me to style, or they wanted their celebrity stylists, they didn't like the concept that we were doing; but it was interesting.  I mean fashion was amazing; I loved it, I got to travel all the time, I was shooting in exotic locations.  I really love the presentation of fashion, but when the opportunity came to be editor-in-chief, it's such a bigger role and platform, and kinda bigger, I think, than I, I really realized.  And then you're managing people, you're dealing with budgets, you were--you know, if something happens wrong with the printer, everything's on you.  So that was like--like I had to grow up really quickly, and I had to become a businessperson really quickly, and had a lotta responsibility, but it was--I still wanted to have fun and I still enjoyed waking up, going to the office, working really hard, and training and growing all these amazing editors.
Story_ID: 156551
Speaker 1: Is there anything that you wanted to do at Vibe that you didn't get to do?
Speaker 2: I don't--I think I had a very good run at Vibe; like I feel like any touch points that I wanted to cover in the magazine, I believe I did.  You know, the one thing that kinda became prickly with management was that I believed at that time that where Vibe was going was more of a culture lifestyle play than a straight music play, which I still believe was correct.  But it's not my magazine (laughter), so--they wanted pure music and a younger audience.  I think what I was creating was something that was growing with the audience and growing with the culture, but at the end of the day, you need young numbers and whichever audience you need to say that you attract, so--but I, I always describe Vibe as being the greatest love of my life; like it's one-a those things where no job is gonna stand up against that.  It was an incredible time in my life.
Speaker 1: When you describe growing with the readers with the--with, with the community--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --I'm reminded once again of Puffy [Sean "Diddy" Combs] because he started Sean John and then, after a while, he made suits.
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm, emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: How did you cover that evolution?  Because he wasn't the only one (unclear), but he was the big one--
Speaker 2: --Well, the, the thing that was most interesting about working at Vibe was--is seeing the maturing of the audience; and not just the audience but the, the celebrities that we were covering.  Like everyone was really young when we started so everyone's wearing cross-colors and, you know, all these baggy things, and then watching the different evolutions happen.  So watching when Arrested Development came out and the impact that had; watching TLC come out and empowering young women and girls; watching Mary [J. Blige] become this diva glam woman, and then seeing Puffy and Will Smith turn into businessmen.  So it was, it was interesting to kind of watch that, and then to see when suddenly like, oh, people are getting married.  Oh, people are having kids.  Oh, they're buying houses, they're going on vacations.  And so--but that was influencing the culture because then you saw the record executives doing similar things, and you see, you know, businesspeople or politicians kind of embracing these same things.  So, it didn't happened in my tenure but I was so happy when I saw [HM President] Senator [Barack] Obama on the cover of Vibe because to me, that was excellent; like that was a Vibe cover.
Story_ID: 156552
Speaker 1: You became editor-in-chief after [HM] Keith [Clinkscales] left--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --right?  So,--
Speaker 2: But many years after Keith left.
Speaker 1: Many years after Keith, yeah.  What was the difference--Vibe under Keith and Len's [HM Leonard Burnett, Jr.] leadership--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --or Vibe under Miller's [Miller Publishing Group] leadership?  When--well, you had a lotta different roles, but at the point when you were editor-in-chief.
Speaker 2: I mean I think the difference in business leadership at Vibe from when Keith and Len were there to when they weren't, I think Keith and Len were very brilliant about--they had their fingers on the pulse of the community from a business perspective that was very aspirational and, you know, they started this magazine in college that was career-focused, they--you know, they were buppies [young urban black professional] and, you know, you think of the movie 'Boomerang,' it's like I think of Keith and Len.  And so I think, you know, they were doing the Vibe Music Seminar, they were doing all these ancillary events that really supported the brand as a 360 brand which was, again, ahead of its time.  A lot of those events, on a different scale, continued, but I don't think that there was that same kind of zeitgeist passion moment that Keith and Len had; I think it became--some things felt a little bit more businesslike versus community passion shot-calling.
Story_ID: 156553
Speaker 1: I wanna ask you--I wanna transition now into WOW [World of Wilbekin]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --the--what, what you're doing now, the World of Wilbekin.
Speaker 2: Yes.  So--very interesting.  Since I've left Essence--
Speaker 1: --Which was--
Speaker 2: In March of 2014.  You know, tryin' to figure out what would I do, what's my next chapter?  And, you know, I could go work somewhere else, but I had all these people come up to me at events and on the street, and they're like, "I'm glad that you're not at Essence anymore.  I love what you did at Essence and it was great, but we need you to do what you did at Vibe, what you did at GIANT, now."  And it happened time and time again to the point where I'm like, okay, God and the universe were trying to tell me something.  So, the initial idea for this was a blog site that would be my musing on things that happen, and then a place where you can find my archives, my work, things like that.  So, I'm at the Essence Music Festival and it is Fourth of July weekend, and the creative team that I work with put together a landing for World of Wilbekin--WOW, so that I--if I needed to show people or anything, and it was just my photo, it said my name, and it had all my social buttons; it didn't even say World of Wilbekin.  And it was Fourth of July, like early in the morning, and I thought, I'm gonna just throw the dice and do a business play, and I posted and I was like, "In celebration of Independence Day, I'm pleased to share with you a preview of World of Wilbekin--WOW."  The likes kept going, the comments kept going, and people wanted this.  So now, what was just gonna be a blog site is now morphing into a platform where I can have my perspective on the world, and art, and culture, and things like that, but also that people that don't have a platform to show their work, which is really good work, will have a platform to show their work.
Story_ID: 156554
Speaker 1: Talking about hip hop generation and the evolutions that there, there were, like you and [HM] Keith Clinkscales--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --and some others--traditional, I guess, upper middle-class, well-educated black people--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --and then there were people who were more a part of thug life, let's say--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --from Snoop [Dogg] to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--[Dr.] Dre.
Speaker 1: (Laughter)--Dre.
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: How did these singly, very different kinds of people from different socio-economic backgrounds get along?
Speaker 2: Well, I think what's interesting about hip hop music, and then the culture, is that it brought everyone together.  So--for instance, when I was at Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia], we would listen to Public Enemy because at that time, it's like--apartheid's going on, we're protesting, and hip hop really gave this voice of social protest in many ways.  I think there's parts of the kind of ghetto life that hip hop embodies that is very attractive to people because it's almost like, ooh, I'm, you know, goin' to the dark side, or something.  But, in all actuality, a lotta those hip hop artists have--end up becoming millionaires and billionaires based off of creating this art and this music, so it's kind of a weird thing.  I also think that people forget that most hip hop music that was purchased during those years was purchased in the '90s [1990s], and 2000, by young white kids.  Black people were not buying that music; we could hear it on the radio, we could hear at the club, so I think that is something else.  And I also think a lotta the lyrics that are in hip hop are, are very empowering in many ways against racial strife, against anything--you think about it; it's very counter-culture, and I think that in that, people embrace that because this was a way to be empowered without commodifying who you are.  You could still be black, you could still be cool, you could still be affluent, and you could still be successful, and you didn't necessarily have to wear a suit and tie to do that.  So, I think that a lotta the lessons--if you think about a Jay-Z, who used to sell drugs and has clearly turned his life around into a businessman, and you look at who he surrounds himself with--a dream hampton who, you know, is a brilliant writer, is in Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts] right now, you know, that he would be with Beyonce.  Like he surrounds himself with people who are smart, people who are cultured, and people that have great ideas.  So I think there's definitely been this kind of mixing; that's the beauty of, of hip hop, you know?  That's the beauty of what it represented, and the fact that it's broken down regionally, that you would have Cash Money, from New Orleans [Louisiana], that you would have Master P, that you would have Dre, Snoop, and these guys from the West Coast, that you have Missy Elliott and Timbaland from Maryland [sic,Virginia], and Pharrell [Williams] from Virginia.  This is the voice of our country, like this is from all walks of life coming together and forming something that's, that's new and exciting, and really the voice of that generation.
Story_ID: 156555
Speaker 1: Now, to play devil's advocate--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --there's also a tremendous amount of backlash with misogyny, with, you know, every other word being the N-word--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm, emm-hmm--still.
Speaker 1: --with the video ho's, I mean (laughter) that's--
Speaker 2: Yes.  So there are also a lot of negative (laughter) moments associated with hip hop, so misogyny, homophobia, you know, using the N-word, references to gun play; I mean those things are, you know, not great, but that's the rock and roll part, too, you know?  And I'm, and I'm not saying it's okay because it's not, but it is something that--it's interesting how it has evolved and changed somewhat.  But it's also scary 'cause that's influencing not just African American community, but then it's global.
Speaker 1: Well--because you said there was primarily young white kids who were buying the music--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but also, Asians are huge consumers--
Speaker 2: Yeah--international, yeah.
Speaker 1: --of hip hop culture.  And, going back to the whole--the--that--the misogyny part with the women being paid nothing, or fifty dollars for a fourteen-hour day to be nearly naked in a music video--
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: --for the chance, and then up comes Karrine Steffans with Video Vixen--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --and Kim Kardashian (laughter).
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: So, where, where is the responsibility in that?
Speaker 2: Hmm.  Very good question, [HM] Harriette [Cole] (laughter).  Yeah, I mean--listen, hip hop is, I think, about--it's confronting, it's challenging, it is conflicting, and I think that it, it has had such a strong influence on a--generations and, and will continue to.  And I think that--when I think of the work that I did at Vibe, we tried to find those moments to address those things--not always doing the best job but, you know, how do you make a difference and uplift, and show people something that's different?  But it's tricky; it's definitely tricky.

Speaker 1: Then there's the--when you, you mentioned Jay-Z and Beyonce; it's interesting listening to--you know now--because they're in everybody's eye, public eye--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --there are lots of questions about whether their relationship is going to last--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --and there was the public elevator experience of Solange [Knowles] bein' up in Jay[-Z]'s face.  But Beyonce's music--this, this most recent music, is quite telling.  Like, over-sexualized, yes, but the messaging--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --seems to say, trouble at home.
Speaker 2: Emm.
Speaker 1: And I'm curious about the, the--as a journalist--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm, emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --how, how did you--when you were at Vibe and, and, and on-going, but Vibe in particular, look at that kind of content and, and interpret it for your readers?
Speaker 2: I think that we tried to do very interesting journalistic pieces, so having Zadie Smith interview Eminem, you know; having bell hooks write for the magazine.  Like, we tried to infuse--you know, having Joan Morgan write, and to do thoughtful things, and also to take people to task because, you know, it, it wasn't just like, oh, everything's okay, everyone's wearing thong bikinis and naked, and that's not it; like that's a fraction of it.  And I--you know--and I'm not gonna say that my slate is clean; like there were definitely some stories that I wish, you know, I could make go away, or the visuals maybe weren't the best, but I think it was all like learning; like we were kind of building and growing as we went along and, you know, as I'm older, I mean I think my biggest challenge with, with being there at that--at the end of my tenure was, I don't wanna be in the club at forty-something.  And my perspective, like I don't know if young people wanna hear me preaching to them in that way.  Now, with that said, I think [HM] Russell Simmons, I think Reverend Run [Joseph Simmons]--I think there's people, [HM] Reverend [Al] Sharpton, who know how to speak to different generations, but I do think that their kind of social responsibility is a big--is a challenge; but I think it's a challenge in our community, I would say, in general.  Like I don't wanna just put that on hip hop either, but hip hop has not done the best in being responsible.
Story_ID: 156557
Speaker 1: I think of two trends that I think affect how people live, not--you can tell me how you might think they do, but tats [tattoos], you know, the, the a l--many of the artists are now completely tattooed--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm, emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --and therefore, many young people are doing it also.  I'm just curious about tattoos in hip hop culture--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --and what affect you believe that has had on society.
Speaker 2: Hmm.  I've not thought of that.  I'm of two minds about tattoos.  I think it depends on what--where the tattoos are, and what the messages are.  When I see young women that are like tattooed all over their chest and their back and their arms and then they're wearing like a spaghetti-strap dress, that's challenging to me.  But then I see the other side of--someone has their child's name or their mother's name, and it's in a cool place like--that you don't necessarily see in a business situation; I'm not mad at that.
Speaker 1: Is that your parents talking?
Speaker 2: No, my--no.  I mean I have tattoos, and you don't see them, and whenever my mother [Cleota Proctor Wilbekin] sees them, she's like, "When did you do that?"  And it's, it's kinda funny.  You know, but I, I think it goes back to what we talked about before, it's that embracing prison culture; it's embracing these kind of, you know, negative elements that is, is challenging.  But I mean I could go on and on about so many things like that that I see.
Speaker 1: Well--and so the one other that I wanted to mention is this unbelievable trend; it's, it's spread so vastly, of not wearing a belt, and your pants literally falling off.  And it's a pervasive trend.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I mean, that is disturbing to me on a lotta levels, especially in this day and age; like it's been so long, and when the president [HM Barack Obama] said, "Guys, pick your pants up."  I mean, that part--yeah, I don't know what that is because it's also almost like a lack of self-confidence and a lack of--almost like self-love, like why are walking where you can't really walk?  And then why--no one needs to see your underwear or your behind sticking out of your pants like--and then based on where it comes from, which is prison, so that people don't kill themselves or hurt people with the belts, to keep that going is, is not great.

Speaker 1: What do you think the legacy of hip hop culture will be, you know, if we look at it twenty years from now?
Speaker 2: I mean I'd like to romanticize it twenty years from now and say that hip hop music gave people that didn't have a voice a voice; it became a business that positively changed a lotta people's lives, and that it is something that brought different cultures together in a celebratory and powerful and positive way.  But then there's all this other stuff that we will--you know, we have to see.  But again, I don't wanna put everything on hip hop because there's the court system, the justice system; there's so many problems with our community that I don't wanna put the onus on hip hop.  I think it's kind of part and parcel of a bigger issue that we have in this country with racism, civil rights, and self-confidence and self-love, and knowledge of, of history.  And I think that all of those things together--and poverty and education.  And I think once you put all of that together, yeah, that's not the good side of hip hop.
Speaker 1: But as their--we, we break groups down like in-Millennials, the Gen X [Generation X], hip hop is its own kind of--takes--occupies a particular space.
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Do, do you feel like it has an end point?
Speaker 2: I mean--many people would argue that hip hop doesn't exist anymore so, you know, if you listen to urban radio, a lot of it is very euro-techno--Australian women rapping; I mean it's, it's, it's changed.  So, yeah, I, I think it has had (laughter) an end point; like I, I wouldn't say that hip hop exists the way hip hop existed in the late '70s [1970s] through mid-2000.
Story_ID: 156559
Speaker 1: Is there anything I haven't asked you that you'd like to share?
Speaker 2: No, that last part was so good (laughter).  Like, those were really good.
Speaker 1: Well, I have one other question regarding the World of Wilbekin [WOW].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, as you are creating this, you see--you, you, you talked about art and, and what, what you're seeing and that we'll look through your eyes and others.
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Knowing where there are gaps editorially, now--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --I'm curious as to what your intentions are for filling some of those gaps.
Speaker 2: I mean, the thing is, I'm building it as I go because it is basically gonna be a digital platform which will change constantly.  There will be live component events--live event components; there will be hopefully film and television.  I just think there's an opportunity to tell stories that haven't been told, and tell them in a way that they're not told.  And it was interesting--someone said, "Just build the platform."  And I think that in building the platform, obviously, the intention is--again, my thing is to move culture.  So, how can I give something that's different and present a platform that's different, that gives people the opportunity to have a different perspective that we don't see anywhere else.
Speaker 1: And what business model are you using so that it can be monetized?
Speaker 2: Digital--digital, digital, digital.
Speaker 1: Just creating just the standard--creating space for ads?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there'll be spaces for ads and, and all that; I may do a kick-starter campaign.  Live events will be helpful in, in building revenue, but it's--you know, this brave new world of--I just feel like if I don't dive in, then where does my legacy go?  And so I actually have worked on digital platforms and social media platforms on live events, and actually know how to do this; I just think we're missing some soulfulness and we're missing some real spirit in what we see out there, and so I wanna be able to, to show that type of work.
Speaker 1: When are you launching?
Speaker 2: The goal (laughter) is to launch on New Year's Day [January 1], 2015.
Speaker 1: And the legacy that you are looking to create through this is what?
Speaker 2: I think it's a good--the legacy that I wanna create through World of Wilbekin is simply an extension of everything that I've done up into this point, so it is--I want it to be excellent, I want it to be beautiful, I want it to be thought-provoking, provocative, thoughtful; it will definitely be the older version of myself, so--but I'm just excited that people are so excited, and that's the thing I think that was really humbling was people reaching out to me like, "What can I do?  What do you need?  I have this idea; can--I wanna give this to you."  So I think it is really creating something like that; I mean you mention Interview, but I think of when Essence was started, how it was started.  I think of when Vibe was started; it's like you have this kind of basic premise and then you grow it.  So, I'm excited.

Speaker 1: This is my mother and father's wedding picture.  Dr. Cleota P. [Proctor] Wilbekin and Harvey Wilbekin in Des Moines, Iowa; very glamorous, very over-the-top.  They had about three hundred guests at their wedding, and it was definitely a society wedding.

Speaker 1: So, this is in Cincinnati [Ohio]; well, it's actually in the town of Silverton [Ohio] at the municipal building.

Speaker 2: This photo--I'm sorry, this other one is (simultaneous)--

Speaker 2: This is a portrait of my grandmother Julia Procter, and my grandfather Stanley Procter in Des Moines, Iowa with my mother's parents, and this is a picture of my mother and father out on a night (laughter) on the town, Dr. Cleota P. Wilbekin and Harvey Wilbekin, in Cincinnati.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a good one.  So, this is a photo of my mother and I on the steps of my father's church in St. Croix and--Oh--Lord God of Sabaoth Lutheran Church in Christiansted, St. Croix.  That's probably like mid-'70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: The next photo is family portrait at home in our house in Cincinnati; it's my father, attorney Harvey Wilbekin, myself, my brother Erik Wil--Erik J. Wilbekin, and my mother Dr. Cleota P. Wilbekin, in our living room at 6142 Hedge Avenue.
Speaker 1: This picture, I am five years old, and went on my mother's--I--my mother took me to work that day, and one of her co-workers took this photo, and it's like her favorite photo of me, so--with my wild hair, she calls it.
Speaker 2: So this is one of our family photos.  I am five years old and dressed myself, but it is my mother, Dr. Cleota P. Wilbekin, my father Harvey Wilbekin, and my brother Erik John Wilbekin and, yeah, it's like a Sears Portrait Studio moment.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of me at the foster home, before I was adopted, when I was ten months old.
Speaker 2: How old were you when you were adopted?
Speaker 1: Oh, you know what?  That's not right.  This is--I was adopted at six months, so this is not--'cause it says, "Peter at ten months," which is not me.  But this is the--the adoption agency sent me this photo, so this was before I was adopted, so I was less than six months.  And that's in Cleveland, Ohio.
Speaker 2: This is a--this is a photo of me and my grandmother, Julia Proctor, showing how fashionable I was even at age like four, and my mother and brother are putting a table together in the back.
Speaker 1: This is a photo of my mother and my grandmother in our house in Cincinnati, and that is probably like 1992.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my mother, Dr. Cleota P. Wilbekin, with a quilt skirt that she made, at one of her exhibitions, and she's wearing her signature necklace.  And I believe that's like the early '90s [1990s], too--also.
Speaker 1: This is a photo of me at my graduation from Columbia Journalism School [Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, New York, New York] in 1990, and then this is a photo of the Little League team I played on, the Cubs, and I am the one in the middle with the glove, and then my father is right there, 'cause he was one of the coaches.
Speaker 2: Do you know what year this was?
Speaker 1: That is--let's see, I was probably like five; like '72 [1972].
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know if you need both; I just grab.  But that's--this is the house that I grew up in in Cincinnati that my mother and father built; my father designed it, and it is a red--it's made all out of Redwood.  It's home.
