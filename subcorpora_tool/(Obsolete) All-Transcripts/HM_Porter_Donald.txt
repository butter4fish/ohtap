Speaker 1: How did she spell it?

Speaker 1: What's your favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color when dressing is brown.
Speaker 1: Any other favorite--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I like brown and tan and blue, but brown like brown suits, brown shoes.  That's my favorite color for dressing.
Speaker 1: Any favorite colors for anything else?
Speaker 2: I guess blue would be next in line.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And tan, because they all blend in together.
Speaker 1: And where is your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I haven't had many vacations like overseas or anywhere. But I have places that I would like to go, if you wanna hear that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I can't say I have a favorite place from having been there. But I would like to go--and I have heard a lot about Bermuda from a lot of friends enough and all who have gone. And I've read up on it. And that's some place that I look forward to going, sometime in the near future.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you have a favorite verse or saying that you live by?
Speaker 2: Oh I have several of those.  One saying comes to mind that I've liked over the years.  "The difficult we do right away.  The impossible takes a little longer."  That's one I like. And others would be different scriptures because I been a student of the Bible for quite some time. So most of the things that I predicate my life on are from the scriptures.
Story_ID: 11861
Speaker 1: Let's start with your earliest memory. You say your maternal grandmother [Lela Laura Reed] stayed with you for a while. So you remember her.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes. I remember her well.
Speaker 1: What do you remember most about her?
Speaker 2: Well she was so--she was very kind. She was very kind and she was very giving. And she was always buying us presents and things. You know, as a child you would very definitely remember that. And I remember I learned a statement from her when I was real little. She used to use it quite a bit. And I never knew what the word meant until I was grown. But she used to say, "God is omnipotent." And that word always stayed in my thought. And I never knew what it meant, and I never really inquired at that time. But as I got older and began to study the scriptures, that word came into focus. God is omnipotent. You know, unlimited in power, etc. So that was something I learned from my grandmother inadvertently. She didn't necessarily--it was a saying of hers. It was just a saying of hers.
Speaker 1: What is your favorite--what story do you have to illustrate what kind of relationship you had with your maternal grandmother?
Speaker 2: I don't--I can't recall any particular incidents. Because I can't recall any outstanding incidents, because we just did regular every day things. We interacted every day, because she worked incidentally. She worked most of the time. So she--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) What did she do?
Speaker 2: I don't remember what she did (laughs). But I know she worked. And so she would come home in the evenings, and we would just have interaction at dinner and discussion and things like that. And then, you know, she would go to bed. I don't remember her actually ever taking us anywhere. I just can't recall whether she did.
Speaker 1: And--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) But I do know that when she passed in 1954, I stayed in the bed for a week (laughs). I just--I was devastated. I just could not understand that.
Speaker 1: How old were you when she died?
Speaker 2: I had to be about seventeen, sixteen, sixteen or seventeen or maybe fifteen or sixteen. yeah.
Speaker 1: So--and you were the oldest child. So she spoiled you.
Speaker 2: Well she was kind of evenhanded though. I would have to say she was very evenhanded (laughs). I don't remember being spoiled by her (laughs).
Story_ID: 11862
Speaker 1: Give me the names of your brother and sister?
Speaker 2: My sister's name is Grace Porter. It's not Porter now, but then. My brother's name--he was named after my dad, Peter Porter, Jr. And Grace's birthday is July the 30th and she was born in, let's see, '39, 1939 I believe. And my brother Peter was born in July 9th, '41, 1941.
Speaker 1: And your sister's married name?
Speaker 2: Gibson.
Story_ID: 11863
Speaker 1: Now you say your paternal grandmother [Athelia Porter] had a church. Did you ever go to her church?
Speaker 2: Well she didn't have her own church that I recall. But she was like a traveling evangelist. She was always in different cities and towns. 'Cause I--she used to send cards all the time. And I will always remember this. She would always put Master Donald Porter. She always spelled that all--all out. So I always understood that "MR" was an abbreviation for Master, because she always wrote that out on the cards that she would send for the holidays.
Speaker 1: You never traveled with her?
Speaker 2: No. No.
Story_ID: 11864
Speaker 1: What was it like growing up in the Porter household?
Speaker 2: It was--it was good, basically. I mean it was very good. I mean I'm not gonna say my mom [Edna Mae Porter] and dad [Peter Porter] were the best of--had the best of congeniality all the time, because they did not. But basically I mean, I don't remember any severely difficult times. We always had enough to eat. Because my dad was--always worked. I remember even during the [Great] Depression time he worked this--with this work program called WPA [Works Progress Administration]. I forget what those initials mean now. But it was a government-sponsored work program. And pretty soon after that, he got a job in the steel mill, at which time; we had to move out of the projects. Because he began to make too much money for us to live in the projects. And consequently, this is how I moved to Gary, Indiana because we brought a new home in Gary, Indiana in about 1951.
Speaker 1: What project were you in?
Speaker 2: Ida B. Wells [Homes, Chicago, Illinois], right on 39th Street. First we lived on 39th Street and then we moved--got a bigger place on 38th Street, 639 East 38th Street. We were there the longest. That's why I can remember the address even. I went through my whole--most of my grammar school years at that address. At the previous address, I went to Doolittle Grammar School [Chicago, Illinois] for a while. And then at the latter address, I went to Oakland Grammar School [Chicago, Illinois], where I graduated in 1951.
Speaker 1: So you started high school in the Gary area?
Speaker 2: I started high school in Chicago. I graduated from grammar school in January of that year. And I enrolled in [Edward] Tilden Tech[nical High School, Chicago, Illinois]. And the reason I went to Tilden Tech is--it was an all boys' school. And--but it was a technical school. But they had a course in aeronautics. And I thought I wanted to be a pilot, at that time. So anyway, I went to Tilden Tech for a semester. And I got on the swimming team, etc. And then all of a sudden, you know, my dad got this job in the mill. And then about six months later or a little less, we had to move. And so the September of that year, I started school in Gary, Indiana. Gary Roosevelt [High School, Gary, Indiana] to be exact. Which is--that's the most beautiful high school in Gary, Indiana. It looks like a college, the campus and all. It's so well-manicured and etc.
Speaker 1: And you stayed there through high school?
Speaker 2: I stayed there through high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 11865
Speaker 1: What kind of relationship did you have with your mom [Edna Mae Porter]?
Speaker 2: Oh my mom and I we got along fine. My mom is a very gentle person. She was a very gentle woman. She was always congenial, never really getting upset. She was--you could always count on her for, you know--if there was anything that she could do and you asked her to do it, she would do it at all times. And I had a very good relationship with my mom.
Speaker 1: Did your mother spoil you?
Speaker 2: I can't say she spoiled me. What--maybe you need to give me a definition of what you would be considered spoiled? Because--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) My definition of spoil is (laughs) where they give you--kind of let you have free reign.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Let's do what you want and--.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) you know, always--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Okay.
Speaker 1: Looking out for you, giving you goodies, taking you places.
Speaker 2: Okay. Well yeah, my mom took us places, and she pretty much let me do what I wanted to do. I didn't--of course, I didn't have everything I wanted to have. That's what I always think of when you say spoiled. A spoiled brat or something. He's got everything he wants (Laughs). I didn't have everything I wanted. But I had--I did have a nice childhood, very nice childhood.
Speaker 1: And I asked you that question, 'cause usually the first and the boy, they--families usually make over (laughs) the first child, 'cause it's, you know, all new to them.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay. Give me a story that illustrates the kind of relationship you had with your mother?
Speaker 2: Well my mom, she liked music. And she played the piano, you know. Because of this incidentally, this is way back when my grandmother [Lela Laura Reed] bought us a piano. It was a brand new Kimball. I'll never forget--upright. And I am saying a lot of my musical background comes from my mother's influence with music. The influence she had on me. Some of the albums and music that she played during the day, you know, I am absorbing this as a little boy. You know. She had all the Ink Spots' records. She had Nat King Cole. She had Dinah Washington. And--her and my dad [Peter Porter], 'cause that was a mixed bag there. They had that. And like I said, she played the piano. One thing she instilled in me also is she always wanted to have her own business. So she was always in the process of trying to start her own business. For example, she would go out--she went out--I remember once she went out and bought a little pan printing press, you know, with all of what it took, and she started printing up business cards to sell. And then another time, she went out, she got involved in a project of making lamps. You know, meaning--out of plaster of paris. Where you'd have to get the mold and mix up the plaster of Paris and put it in the lamp--put the stem down in the lamp, run the wire through, paint it and etc., etc. So she kind of--she did instill a sense of business in me at an early age too. You know, not consciously doing it, like, "Here's what you do." But just by her example, you know.
Speaker 1: And so did you play the piano? Did you learn to play?
Speaker 2: I--they started me off taking lessons and I did not follow through on it. But what I could do, as well as, my brother [Peter Porter, Jr.], I could sit down at the piano--needless we had it there. I could sit down and pick out anything I wanted to play and play it by ear. Meaning, you know, I could sit there and I learned how to play by ear. You know. But I never learned the technicalities. I did learn some of the basics about how to move your fingers, the two--the few lessons I did take. But I didn't follow through enough to really master being a piano player. Even though that is my favorite instrument. I love piano music, okay.
Speaker 1: Did your brother take the lessons formerly?
Speaker 2: No. He didn't either. But he also played well. He also sat and could play just about anything he wanted to play. You know. Like--like an Erroll Garner. You know, Erroll Garner had no piano lessons. But you would (laughs) never know that by listening to him (laughs).
Story_ID: 11866
Speaker 1: Tell me about your relationship with your dad?
Speaker 2: My dad [Peter Porter]--my dad was--when I was a little boy, my dad was my idol. I mean, if my dad told me something, nobody else could tell me something different. His word was absolute law to me. If he said it, that was it period. I mean, I looked up--I was not a mama's boy incidentally. I was a dad's boy. I mean, that's just the way that was. My dad, he bought me just about every toy--at Christmas time, he bought just about every toy for all of us, but that you could think of. And I remember he started buying me these train sets. And each Christmas, we would add a--add to the train set until after a few years, I had enough--I had several trains and tracks and all of the paraphernalia that goes with it that would take up the whole apartment almost. You know, the whole kitchen and living room, you know. Switches, you know, all of that. And I remember when he bought me my first bike, which was a Sears-J. C. Higgins. And he rode me home on it. We went down the--he rode me home on the bike, you know. And also when I was a little older, I would sneak in and get his car keys. I learned how to drive by sneaking his car out at night. This was in Gary, Indiana. The train set business was while we were still in Chicago [Illinois]. That's where that started. You know. And--But I had a good relationship with my dad. I eventually, you know, after a break in the singing career, he got me a job in the steel mill, where he worked. So I worked in the steel mill with my dad for a brief period of time, you know, for a couple of years, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you ever go to the steel mill with him when you were younger some days?
Speaker 2: No. No. Nope.
Speaker 1: And tell me, do you have one story for me you can share with us that is a fond memory of your--you and your dad together?
Speaker 2: Well I have several, but one that just came to thought when you mention that is, my dad was a swimmer. He had medals from when he was in school that he had won. And over the course of years, we never were able to go swimming together. I don't know. It just never happened. I mean we never went swimming together. But the way he taught me how to swim is, he just put a couple of chairs together in the living room. Told me to--how to stiffen up and put me across the chairs and showed me how to stroke, you know, show me how to stroke. And so I went up to Madden Park [Chicago, Illinois]. Madden Park is there on 38th Street, down in the Ida B. Wells [Homes, Chicago, Illinois] projects. When I went to Madden Park and jumped in the water, I had a hard time. Because he didn't--he hadn't showed me how to--how to dogpaddle. But I did get--managed to get to the top and I could swim on just what he showed me from that.
Story_ID: 11867
Speaker 1: From your good relationship with your dad [Peter Porter], you enjoyed being a father?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: And--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I mean I--that was a complete reversal from the way I thought about it at first. I--I had no intentions--I had no aspirations to get married when I was young. I mean very honestly, most people I saw didn't get along that well. And I was thinking to myself, "Why would I wanna get into something like this, you know. You know? And at the time, I mean, "Why would I just want to be with one person (laughs) you know, forever and ever?" You know? But, you know, as a result of--like I said, as a result of becoming a student of the scriptures, the influence of reading the scriptures transforms that attitude into, "This is the way you do this." Like there is the scripture that says, "It is better to be married than to burn." 'Cause it doesn't mean burn in hell. It means being--burning with passions. It's better to be married than to, you know, be in that situation. And there're several other scriptures that support and encourage the fact that you should be married. So after my attitude was changed about that, I enjoyed it. I mean it was--it was great.
Story_ID: 11868
Speaker 1: Let's trace your school life from elementary school [Oakland Grammar School, Chicago, Illinois]. What do you remember most about elementary school? Who was your favorite teacher?
Speaker 2: My very favorite teacher was a teacher named Mrs. Jackson. And she was a--she was very short, and she was very strict. But one thing she instilled in me that I just never forgot was, she emphasized phonetics. For example, she would say, "telephone." She said, "this is the actual way that should be pronounced, telephone or tomato, potato." She overemphasized these things. But it always stuck with me, how important it was to really enunciate and pronunciate. And this was about--I was--I guess I was in about fourth or fifth grade when this was impressed on me by her. And it's just something I carried through the years.
Speaker 1: What school were you at?
Speaker 2: This was Oakland Grammar School on 39th [Street], right off of Cottage Grove--41st--39th, 41st [Street] and Cottage Grove [Avenue], off of Cottage Grove so--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Do you remember the day you entered elementary school?
Speaker 2: No, I do not. But it wasn't at Oakland. I do remember that. Because I went to some--it wasn't a preschool, 'cause we didn't have preschools at that time. But I entered school before we lived at 639 East 38th Street. So I don't remember where that school was, kindergarten and first grade. I don't--oh Doolittle. It was Doolittle. Doolittle Grammar School [Chicago, Illinois]. That's right, Doolittle. That was where I first entered school, which was somewhere around the 35th [Street] and Giles [Avenue], up in that vicinity. I don't even know if Doolittle is still there today or Oakland (laughs).
Speaker 1: Do you--do you have other special memory of your grammar school years? What kind of student were you at that time?
Speaker 2: I was a good student. I mean I made good grades in grammar school. I mean I was kind of surprised, although, I went through a little--when I say surprised when I look back--I looked back at some of my cards that I had. But anyway, I made good grades in grammar school. And I learned--you know, I had good teachers. I have to say that. I had good teachers. It just baffles me how anybody could come through a school system today and not be able to read in high school. I can't fathom that. Because I knew how to read in the first grade, up and down Pleasant Street, Dick and Jane. See Spot Run. You know. How do you not--how do you come through high school and you can't read? That--I can't fathom that. I mean the teachers that I had just were excellent teachers, you know, throughout grammar school. I mean they--I had a very good elementary education.
Speaker 1: Where did you go to middle school?
Speaker 2: Now this reminds me too. There was a poem that I had to learn in grammar school. I'm trying to think of the teacher that--oh, Mrs. McKnight. Anyway I had to learn a poem called 'My Duty To Myself'. "I have to live with myself and so I wanna be fit for myself to know. I want to be able, as the days go by, always to look myself squarely in the eye. I don't wanna set with the setting sun and hate myself for the things I've done. I wanna go out with my head erect, always to deserve all man's respect. Here in the struggle for fame and wealth, I wanna be able to like myself. I don't wanna look at myself and know that I'm blustered and blunt and empty show. I see what others may never see. I know what others may never know. I can never fool myself and so I can never hide myself from me. Whatever happens, I want to be self-respecting and conscious-free." And would you believe when I became a senior, a graduating senior in Gary, Indiana, the high school teacher--The teacher required that we know that poem. Well needless to say, I already knew it (laughs). You know what I mean. I had a leg up on that. Because I'd been knowing that poem since I was in grammar school.
Speaker 1: Now who was that by?
Speaker 2: Oh that's by Wadsworth. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.
Speaker 1: That's a nice delivery you gave us too.
Speaker 2: Oh that's something that's been in my heart a long time.
Speaker 1: And how were the middle school years? Any favorites--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) You mean high school?
Speaker 1: You know, like seventh, eighth grade--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh. School of itself--I was in school, of course. There was no--I wasn't involved in any special activities in school. So in that sense, I don't--there's nothing I can recall outstanding about those years at all, as far as being, you know. Nothing occurs to me at this point.
Speaker 1: Did you have any favorite classes?
Speaker 2: My favorite class--I liked English, you know. I did not like math (laughs). It took me a long time to realize why I didn't like math.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: I didn't like math, because you--you didn't have any options. You were either right or wrong period. You had no options (laughs). So that's what I didn't like about math. It was like, you know, there was no latitude or longitude. You either get this--this is either right or wrong period. You know. I came to appreciate that fact later on, you know. But at the--when I was very young, I did not like math. But I did like English and try to think of any other subjects in particular. I liked--when I got to high school, excuse me, I liked languages. I had the opportunity to take Spanish in high school. And at that time, you know, there was French, Spanish and German offered. And I chose Spanish.
Story_ID: 11869
Speaker 1: You were about to tell us where you got your poetry from.
Speaker 2: My dad [Peter Porter]--my dad liked poetry. And he would quote different--There were certain poems that he knew and he would--He would quote 'em to us. One was 'Lias'. Have you ever heard 'Lias' by Paul Laurence Dunbar?  "'Lias, 'Lias, bless the Lord. Don't you know the day is broad. If you don't get up, you scamp, there're be trouble in this camp. Think I'ze gonna let you sleep, while I make your board and keep." Hmm. "That's a pretty how to do. Don't you hear me 'Lias, you? 'Lias, 'Lias, no use turning toward the wall. Don't you hear me when I call? I can hear that mattress squeak. Don't you hear me when I speak? That there clock done struck off six. Caroline bring me them there sticks. Oh you down son, you down. Look here, don't you dare to frown. March in there and wash that face and don't you splatter up all this place. Get that comb and comb that head. Look just like a feather bed. Every morning round this place, seems as I must lose my grace. Sit down at that table there and just you whimper if you dare. Fold yo' hands and bow yo' head and wait until the blessings said. Lord have mercy on our soul. Don't you dare to touch them rolls. Bless this food we's gwine eat. You keep still boy, I see them feet. Just you try that trick again. Gin' us peace and joy Amen." My dad used to quote that to us all the time. He'd put a bandana on his head and just come in and quote it to us, you know. Since I can--you know, I can't even remember. That one I learned by heart. Another one I don't know by heart. But he used to--he loved it also. It was called 'The Children's Hour' [by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]. I just remember a couple of phrases of that. "Between the dark and the daylight, when the night is beginning to lower, comes a pause in the day's occupation that is known as the children's hour." You know. And then it goes on. And--I never learned that one. But I've gotten it. I went and looked it up and gotten it. And he [sic, James Leigh Hunt] had another one called 'Abou Ben Adhem'. "May his tribe increase." And it goes on--it ends up with him--a angel appears to him. And he says, "he's not written in the book." And he says, "Well add my name to this book as one that loves the Lord." You know, that's how it ends up. So he had several poems that, you know, that just put my focus on poetry.  And certain poems I liked a lot.
Speaker 1: Have you written any poetry yourself?
Speaker 2: I never tried to write any. But over the years, there have been a few poems like that one that I had to learn in school. And then one I learned called 'The Bridge Builder'. Have you ever heard that one? 'The Bridge Builder' is by Wadsworth Longfellow [sic, by Will Allen Dromgoole] also. "An old man going a lone highway, came at the evening cold and gray. To a chasm, vast deep and wide, through which was flowing a sullen tide. The old man crossed in the twilight dim. That sullen stream had no fear for him. But he turned when he reached the other side and built a bridge to span the tide. 'Old man,' said a pilgrim standing near. You're wasting strength in building here. Your journey will end with the ending day. You never again shall pass this way. You have crossed the chasm deep, vast and wide. Why build you a bridge at the even tide? The builder lifted his old gray head. "Good friend, in the path I have cometh," he said.  There followeth after me today, a youth whose feet must past this way. He too, must cross in the twilight dim. Good friend, I'm building this bridge for him."

Speaker 1: Who was your favorite teacher during the high school period [Roosevelt High School, Gary Indiana]?
Speaker 2: My favorite teachers were my English teachers. I liked English literature in high school. In my sophomore year, her name was Mrs. Lovell. In my junior year, her name was Mrs.--oh it'll occur to me. And in my senior year was Mrs. Duncan. I don't know why I can't think of the one in junior year. Anyway they were my favorite teachers (laughs).  They  were my absolute favorite teachers.
Speaker 1: Can you graduate--What high school did you attend?
Speaker 2: Gary Roosevelt [High School].
Speaker 1: And you graduated from Gary?
Speaker 2: In 1956.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did you meet your sweetheart before or after that?
Speaker 2: After that.
Speaker 1: Okay. The prom. Did you go to the prom?
Speaker 2: Yes, I went to the prom.
Speaker 1: Tell me your memories of your high school prom?
Speaker 2: It was--the theme song was 'Stairway to the Stars'. Of course, this was the first time I had been in a tuxedo (laughs) . And the first time I'd bought a girl a corsage. And I rode with a friend of mine who had a--a convertible. Of course, we graduated in June. We came over to Chicago [Illinois]. I remember after the part of the prom, and we went to a club called Robert's. You know, Robert's Show Lounge [Chicago, Illinois]. The prom itself was just a lot of fun. I don't know what to say. It was a lot of fun. It was--the dancing and the socializing. It was just a lot of fun.
Speaker 1: They let you in at Robert's Show Lounge (laughs)?
Speaker 2: No, I was gonna say, oh we did not get in (laughs).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) (Laughs).
Speaker 2: No, we tried to get in. They did not let us in. So we drove all the way over there for nothing. 'Cause they wouldn't--"You can't get in. You're too young." "Oh we're coming from the prom." "Well sorry (laughs)."
Story_ID: 11871
Speaker 1: Tell me what sights, sounds and smells remind you most of growing up? What comes to mind when you think of those senses--in your growing up years?
Speaker 2: Well sights--We used to live, like I say, at 639 [East 38th Street], we lived a block away from the streetcar barn. And this is when they had the red trolleys with the overhead connection to the electrical line. But we used to sneak in the barns, you know. 'Cause the barns would be all open. You know, where they park the trolleys at night. And they had some kind of powder. I don't know what it was. But you could--you could get it and it was white. But you could--you could spit on it and it would foam. And if you had it in a can and lit it, it would explode, (laughs). It would throw up the--I don't know. I don't know to this day what that was. But we'd sneak in there and get this stuff sometime. And sometimes, we'd have fun, you know, when the trolleys were coming off the main line, and they were coming around to go into the barn, you know, we'd run up and pull the (laughs)--pull the, you know, the connection to the electric wire off. And--every--the whole car would stop (laughs)--everything would go black. The conductor would be so angry (laughs). He wouldn't know what to do. But we're gone by this time, you know. That was still when I was, you know, twelve or so (laughs).
Speaker 1: (Laughs) So the sight of those trolleys.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well yeah. And then we went into the green trolleys. That's just a kind of sight. Another thing I used to like to do all the time, as far as sights when we were little, I used to love to go to the museums. I used--we used to just--we used to get on the rocks over there on the lake [Lake Michigan] and walk all the way down--a friend of mine, walk all the way down to the museum on twelfth Street. And we'd go to the museum. 'Cause they were free then. You could go in there free. The [Field] Museum of Natural History [Chicago, Illinois], the [Shedd] Aquarium [Chicago, Illinois] and the [Adler] Planetarium [and Astronomy Museum, Chicago, Illinois]. You know. And we--needless to say, that would be all day. And then the Museum of Science and Industry [Chicago, Illinois] well, you know, that was an adventure in itself. You know. So I used to love to go to those places, you know. And I went a lot, I mean with my friends, you know. And--yep.
Speaker 1: What do you--what did it sound like in the Porter household? An average day, a holiday?
Speaker 2: Holiday?
Speaker 1: Anytime?
Speaker 2: Okay. Holidays were festive, all the time. I mean Christmas and Easter were big--well, you know, they were observed in our house, I mean traditionally. You know. Easter we had the ham and the colored eggs and the rabbits and all of that. At all times we dressed up and went to church. And Christmas was--you couldn't get--you couldn't walk through the house  for the toys and stuff (laughs) that were on the floor when we were small and stuff like that. So--and my dad [Peter Porter] was a cook also. I mean my mom cooked good, but my dad was a cook. I mean he had been a chef some time in his life. And he--he always did a lot of the main cooking. Because he liked to cook. So we always had good meals. You know, very good meals.
Speaker 1: Can you cook?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I can cook. Yes, I can cook (laughs). Yep, I been--as a matter of fact, through a lot of our marriage, I did a lot of the cooking for the same reason, that I like to do it. I would come in from work with the food and prepare the dinner and everything. Because I liked to do it. It wasn't a chore to me. It was something I enjoyed doing.
Story_ID: 11872
Speaker 1: So when you graduated from high school [Roosevelt High School, Gary, Indiana], you--you were able to get a job at the mill for two years. Was that right after high school or later?
Speaker 2: No. When I graduated from high school, I was faced with this--these options. I could go to the steel mill. I could go to Morehouse College [Atlanta, Georgia], which is where my dad wanted me to go, or I could go into this professional singing group. So I chose the singing group.
Speaker 1: Okay. You started with the group while you were in high school.
Speaker 2: No. When I was in high school--okay. When I first moved to Gary, Indiana and enrolled in high school, an individual who became my best friend [James 'Dimples' Cochran], he moved in a few months later. He moved across the street. And we met each other and found out--I found--we found out we both were from Chicago [Illinois]. So we became good friends. Now he was a singer. He used to sing--he wa--he sang gospel music and he had performed in Gary, Indiana, prior to moving there. Consequently, the resident gospel group recruited him, as soon as he got there. I being--having become his best friend got to travel around with them and everything. I went to the rehearsals and everything. So this was my first introduction to singing first hand. And he and I, just for fun--we were fifteen. He and I--he had all the records. He had all the Sam Cookes and the Soul Stirrers. He had the Swan Silvertones. He had the Dixie Hummingbirds. He had the Pilgrim Travelers. He had the [Five] Blind Boys [of Mississippi]. He had all of the gospels--all of the prominent groups, he had the records. So we would sit up in his house all day and you know, whenever, listening to these songs. And he would point out each voice to me. Sing along with that voice. Show me--this is the first tenor. This is the second tenor--what the second tenor is doing. This is what the bass tenor is doing. Because, you know, normally when you're sitting, listening to music, if you're not that particularly conscious, you're not aware of all of that. You know. But when you--your attention is focused on it, then you begin--you're able to distinguish. You know. And that was my introduction to learning how to sing. And he and I also, we both after being there for a little while after we became fast friends, we kind of didn't like the fact that we were cut off from Chicago and Gary--it was like moving to the country from the inner city Chicago. And so we started skipping school. We started--we skipped school--we skipped school for a whole semester. And--but at this time, I was learning how to sing. I mean this is what we did while we were off. You know, 'cause we didn't have anything else to do. You know. So we would listen--we would listen to the records, and we would go over to the houses of some of the other singers and listen to the records and so forth. So anyway, we blew a whole year. But I remember--I remember we came to home class one day and the teacher made us get up. She said--she made us stand up. She said, "Oh this is James Cochran and Donald Porter. These are the two names you been hearing me call all semester (laughs) and I never seen." And needless to say, we went through a scenario. You say, well what happened. Of course, they put the truant officer on us. Okay. The truant officer, we just ignored him. So then they put the probation officer on us. Now the probation officer--we were--we were up at school one day, my friend and I and lunch hour. But we had not been attending school. We were there at lunch hour, you know, across the street, dancing and you know, jukebox. So the probation officer came in and (laughs) he saw my friend in the floor. 'Cause he was dancing and I was standing over by the wall. And I saw my friend turn around and point to me (laughs). So the probation officer came and took us both to Crown Point Indiana Detention Home. And we stayed there for a week. Now my--Our parents knew this. So they said, "Well just let 'em stay there for a week and, you know, kind of see if they like this." Needless to say, when I got out of there, I didn't have any trouble (laughs)--I didn't have any trouble going to school after that. You know what I mean. I didn't have any more trouble skipping school. Because we were too young to quit school. We were underage. So we couldn't quit. So we had to be--it was mandatory that you be in school. You know. So I went on and finished school in spite of that episode. But that year was well-spent irrespective of the fact that I--I graduated a year behind my whole class. That was--And plus my sister [Grace Porter] caught up with me. And that was another prompt. You know what I mean. I said, "Oh, no. My sister is not gonna go past me. It's bad enough that she caught up with me."
Story_ID: 11873
Speaker 1: At what point did your best friend discover the Spaniels? Tell me how that happened?
Speaker 2: Okay. The Spaniels--First of all, here we are freshman. And like for example, we'd have a program at school. You know, a talent show. The groups--The Spaniels were we--were performing, but they weren't the Spaniels yet. Can you understand? The Spaniels had not even--didn't exist at this time. There were no Spaniels. Of course, there were the individuals who became the Spaniels. But at this time, there were no Spaniels. They had different--they were going through different phases of personnel, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. So anyway, they finally ended up with the group that became the original Spaniels. And that was with James Hudson, Gerald Gregory--James Hudson, first lead, Gerald Gregory, bass, Ernest Warren, tenor, Opal Courtney, tenor and Willie C. Jackson. Opal Courtney, baritone and Willie C. Jackson, tenor. These were the original Spaniels. So in 1953, they made--they launched the Vee-Jay [Records] label with 'Baby It's You'. That is what established the Vee-Jay label, 'Baby It's You'. That also went to the charts. And then they made several records after that. And then in '54 [1954], they made 'Goodnight Sweetheart, Goodnight'. Okay. Now at this time, two of the main members of the group dropped out. They just, you know, they quit.
Speaker 1: After 'Goodnight'?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they quit. One--one got drafted. Another one quit--two others quit. They just quit the group. So in the meantime, they knew my friend James ['Dimples'] Cochran and we called him 'Dimp'. They knew him. So Gerald, the bass singer, wanting to keep some semblance of a group together, went and got Dimp. 'Cause he knew he was a singer. In turn, they needed another man. So Dimp said, "I got somebody I been working with all the time already." So he, in turn, came and got me. You know. And like I say, this was in '56 [1956]. You know. And the first thing we did is we went into the studio and we made--well not the first thing. I say--that's another story. But at any rate, the first thing we did is, we went out on the road. Even the lead singer, [James] 'Pookie' [Hudson] had quit. So we had--and Gerald went and got Carl Rainge. I brought pictures of him. Carl, Dimp and me and Gerald, we went out as the Spaniels. So everywhere we went, the people were saying, "Where are the Spaniels?" You know. 'Cause they could look at the picture that was up and say, "They're not the Spaniels." So anyway, after that first little outing, we came home and said, "We need to get Pookie back." Who was the lead singer. So he was working night shift or even--yeah, 4:00 to 12:00 at one of those plants in Gary [Indiana]. So we went and picked him up, after work. He jumped in the car. We told him, "Man you gotta come on back to the group." That was the first time I had even met Pookie personally. I had never even met him.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Why did he quit?
Speaker 2: He just--things weren't going well. They weren't making any money. And they had to, you know, go to get--you know, they had to go work for the most part.
Story_ID: 11874
Speaker 1: First of all, in the '50s [1950s], all of the prominent black music was covered by white artist. All of 'em. I mean you take Elvis Presley. Elvis Presley's 'Hound Dog', that's [Willie Mae] 'Big Mama' Thornton, for example. You know. The McGuire Sisters covered 'Goodnight, Sweetheart, Goodnight'. And at that time, they did not play and would not play black music on white stations. So consequently when the black music came out with the white artists doing it, they had the whole country thinking this is--these are their songs. And so the black artists weren't getting the royalties. Even the recognition or anything else. And a lot of people--a lot of--there're several groups that didn't even survive that. Meaning that somebody else--If you look at the history of it, you would say--I mean it goes on and on. Pat Boone--Pat Boone put out so many of Little Richard's songs (laughs) until it was ridiculous. You understand what I'm saying? And, of course, Little Richard has let everybody know that since this time (laughs). Any time you see him, he lets you know this. "We didn't get our money, etcetera, etcetera." So the individuals, you know, they were married. Some of 'em were early married and you know, they had wives to take care of. And they couldn't do it. And then some, like--were not--just not that interested in it. They didn't realize what it could be. So they just walked away from it.
Speaker 2: But 'Goodnight Sweetheart,' that was really the Spaniels version, really overwhelmed the McGuire Sisters.
Speaker 1: But not then.
Speaker 2: It didn't then?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Not at that particular time. The McGuire Sisters's version is the one that got the national attention. You see what I'm saying? I mean at the time they were first released--okay. On the black stations where we played it, because that's what they would do. They would listen to what was going on, on the black stations and take the top records and then give them to their artist on their labels and put it out on their stations.
Speaker 2: Getting in on 'Your Hit Parade' [television program]?
Speaker 1: Yeah. You know, that's the way--that's what--that's what it was done. It was called covering the music.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) So.
Speaker 1: Cover versions of the music. Meaning that it wasn't real. I--you know what I like to call it? We were the butter, that was the margarine. And I always think of that in this context. I remember when I was very small, the first time we ever had any margarine. And at that time, margarine came--it looked like lard. I--this is--I detested margarine. Because it was my job--we didn't do this too much. But it was my job to have--my dad and mom would say, "Make up the butter." And, you know, you get this little packet of coloring and you had to let this stuff sit up at room temperature. And then after it melted down to room temperature, you put this little packet of coloring there and mixed it up until it looked like butter. Then you sit it in the refrigerator and say, I got butter (laughs)." I--to this day, I can't stand margarine. I never eat margarine and I Can't Believe It's Butter and all that imitation stuff. But that's this musical thing. That's this musical thing. Because all of the current music--all of the current popular music, the roots of it, the foundation of it, the trunk of the tree is our music period. Take all of that away and you got nothing going today. Because they wouldn't have no foundation. There's no foundation.
Speaker 2: So 'Goodnight Sweetheart' never gave any financial--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) remunerations?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. The majority if not all of the artists in the early '50's [1950s] and all, none of the black artists got their royalties. We didn't know what a royalty check was. Now I remember when I was first even introduced to what royalties were. We were on tour. We were on one of the biggest shows in 1956 with the Drifters. And I mean the original Drifters. I don't mean Ben E. King's Drifters. I mean before Ben E. King. The Drifters, the 'White Christmas', those Drifters. The Cleftones, 'Little Girl of Mine', LaVern Baker, The Everly Brothers. That's another story about, you know, what was going on with the white act--the few white acts on the shows. It'd be fifteen black acts and two white acts. So we would go down South somewhere, they couldn't get on the same stage with us. So they'd have to lay off the show. Because segregation was in full force and black and white couldn't get on the same stage together. You know. But anyway, I was talking with one of the Drifters, and he just mention about, they had gotten a little royalty check. And I said, "What is that?" And then he explained to me what royalties were. Then I'm asking [James] 'Pookie' [Hudson] and Gerald [Gregory], you know, they--I just come in the group. They--I'm saying, "y'all, (laughs) why come we not getting no royalties for these things?" They didn't know what I was talking about either. Anyway we never got any royalties in those days. Now we would--we could go to the record companies and get what they called loans anytime. But they were really giving us our royalties, but we didn't know that. You see what I mean? We could call up somewhere and say, "Hey, we need $1,000." Well, they would send it. Plus they paid for the car that we had. But in actuality we were paying for it our self. We just didn't know it. You know. And this was throughout the industry, as far as black. This was not that exclusive to us. And 'Goodnight Sweetheart' was prominent. For example, that's just like our shows. I mean, we were confined to our own neighborhood. So we had the Regal Theatre [Chicago, Illinois]. We had the Uptown Theatre in Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]. We had the Apollo Theater [Harlem, New York]. We had the Royal [Theatre] in Baltimore [Maryland]. We had the Howard [Theatre] in Washington, D.C. You know? And I mean this was a circuit that we always traveled. These--these theaters were packed. These theaters were packed. I mean all of--Everywhere we went among our own people, it was packed. We had no problems with that at all. And then you had Alan Freed came on the scene. And what he did is, he began to take acts and put 'em downtown in different places. The New York Paramount [Theatre] was a case in point and--because white people didn't come into our--our theaters to see nothing. They didn't--they didn't come into the--they didn't go to the Apollo and the Howard and the Regal. They didn't come to those theaters, period. But they wanted to see these acts. 'Cause, finally this music is breaking through this anyway. Because see what they called it was race music. Which meant, you don't play this on these stations. Which they did not do. You know. But there was a station that played our music anyway. And it--I'll never forget it, WLAC Nashville, Tennessee. And you could hear that station all over the country, just about. You know, because it was a--one of the large stations. It was like, I think a 50,000 watt stations was a big station, at that time. And white kids were listening to our music anyway on the Q.T.--on the quiet tip. You know. They were listening to it anyway. So it was infiltrating, you know, anyway. And when we were on these tours, the audiences on these tours were predominantly white. These were predominantly white audiences in the '50's [1950s]. I mean we go play a coliseum in--Birmingham, Alabama, the audience was predominantly white. You know. Even though they still weren't playing our records on the main stations. You know. So it was beginning to break through anyway. That's what I'm saying.  And the cover versions got the most recognition. Because at others--can you imagine? Here we'd go and sing 'Goodnight, Sweetheart, Goodnight' and have a bunch of people coming up to us, talking about, "Oh that's--you doing the McGuire Sisters's song," (laughs). Can you imagine that? Yeah so.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Who wrote 'Goodnight Sweetheart'?
Speaker 1: 'Goodnight, Sweetheart, Goodnight' was written by James 'Pookie' Hudson who is the lead singer of the Spaniels. Now on the right--on the copyrights, there're other names. But they didn't write--They didn't--that was just something--a practice that the recording companies would do. They would attach themselves to it. Because see, we didn't understand the value of the publishing rights. We didn't even know about that. We had no--our folks didn't know about it. We didn't have anybody to ask about that. You know, but that--they did that. And you'll look on a lot of the songs and see names on there that were not responsible for it. They didn't write it. They didn't even contribute to it. But, you know, while we're out running around singing and everything, this is what they were doing behind the scenes.
Speaker 2: They say [Jerry] Leiber and [Michael] Stoller took a lot of credit for black music. Do--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Who?
Speaker 2: Leiber and Stoller, the write--the music writers.
Speaker 1: I don't know them two.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) They owned a lot of the hits from the '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: Well yeah. See let's put it like this. Any of them that owned hits from the '50s [1950s] stole them. They didn't write that music. They didn't originate that music. They took advantage of the ignorance of the artist, and then they put the music in their names. I went down to the archives--I went to the Million Man March. And while I was at the Million Man March, I went into the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.] and went into look--to the archives to look up 'Goodnight Sweetheart Goodnight' and so forth. I can't explain this to this day. But CBS [Columbia Broadcasting System] and Citibank's names are on there. Now tell me how--how did a little--a group of guys from Gary, Indiana who originated a song, come out started a label, never had no affiliations with these people. How did they names get on the song? How did these institutions get on--how did their names end up on 'Goodnight, Sweetheart, Goodnight' in the Library of Congress? How'd that happen? What is that about? And trying to get lawyers and things, you know, you--you know what it's like? It's like you standing on a playground or something and you've got a bunch of big guys that are bigger than you. And they got your ball and they're passing it over your head. And you're jumping up, trying to get it and you can't get it. Because they're bigger than you. That's what--that's what they have done with our music.
Story_ID: 11875
Speaker 1: In 1973 or 4 [1974], I was--we had--I had not singing with the group--You know, the group originally, you know, the group I'm telling you about, we stopped singing in 1960. Okay. So I hadn't been singing from 1960 til up to this time. I'm walking past a record shop, and I look in the window and see a Spaniels album, a double album. So I go in and I say, "How much is this album"?  And he said, "This album is $14.95". I say, "You been selling many of these"? He say, "I been selling about 200 of these a month for the last year or so." And I just figured that up real quick. Now this is one record shop. And I say--and I looked at the label. Lost Night label out of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] (laughs). My voice is on here. My picture is on here with--along with all the rest of the guys. I say, "What is this?" And here I'm coming--I'm coming in from a job, struggling, trying to take care of my kids and somebody is making money off of my song. I called out here. You know, they had a name on the--an address on the label. I called there and introduced myself and said who I was. And said, "Whose responsible for putting this out?" I heard a lot of hem-hawing and a lot of blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Next time I called there, that number wasn't--didn't exist. So now I'm about the business of trying to find a lawyer. Soon as come--soon as I go downtown Chicago [Illinois]--I mean certain ones were recommended by different individuals in the business that I know. Soon as I walk in the office with the albums, they knew who I was. I mean they knew what it was about, blah, blah, blah. They wanted upfront money. They wanted a lot of up front money, you know, to even pursue this thing, which we didn't have. Finally, through Dee Clark, Delecta Clark. Do you remember--you know who he is?
Speaker 2: I know the name.
Speaker 1: Dee Clark, (singing) "Hey little girl with the high school sweater." Okay. Through Dee Clark, he let me know that Jerry Butler--I know you know who he is. Jerry Butler had a case going in court already about this. And so I got the name of the lawyer that he already had. And when I went down there, he put us on as a rider. Because it was all part of his case. It was just making the case better for them. Because this was all Vee-Jay [Records] stuff. He was trying to get his masters from out of the control of these people. So they put us on there.
Speaker 2: Who was the lawyer?
Speaker 1: His name was [W.] Yale Matheson.
Speaker 2: Did he take on a lot of other artists?
Speaker 1: I don't know. I don't know. I don't know if he took on a lot of other artists. But he was an enter--supposedly an entertainment lawyer.  So I'm assuming that he did. But I got all my group together. It took this thing five years to come up on the court docket. This is like '73 [1973]. And about '78 [1978], it came up on the docket. We had to go down to 219 South Dearborn Street [Chicago, Illinois], the Federal Court building down there. And supposedly, it was supposed to be a trial that was--would be settled right on the spot, without any continuations and all that. Kind of open and shut case. The first thing the judge had to do was send out a command that the individual who had the tapes who was in California, that she been in court the next day. And so she was there. The next day. The one who had purchased the master tapes. Now what happened at this time, Vee-Jay had gone bankrupt and the tapes were auctioned off in court. And this particular woman that bought these tapes, she used to be an employee of Vee-Jay. So that's no problem there. But the point is she's leasing out the tapes all over the place, but we're not getting the royalties. We're supposed to get the royalties. Ain't no problem leasing the tapes out. But we're not getting the royalties that we're supposed to get.
Speaker 2: Did they make her pay?
Speaker 1: That's what this trial was about. Now the opening evidence and everything just made it obvious and evident that she owed money. Her records were supposedly burned up. But the lawyer had determined already through facts and figures that she owed at least twelve million dollars. Now that was to us---back royalties to us, Dee Clark, Jimmy Reed, who died while this was going on. Jimmy Reed, 'Ain't That Lovin' You Baby'. Who else? There was--these are all Vee-Jay artists, incidentally. And let's see. Were the Dells in there? The Dells were in there, the El Dorados, the Spaniels, Jerry Butler, Jimmy Reed. Now there're more Vee-Jay's artists than that. But these are the ones that were on this particular suit. So first day of the trial, it was established that well your music is being pirated. And then this is when the judge commanded that this woman be there for the next day's sessions. Now I took off from work. This--this--this was three days in court. I took off from work to sit up here. 'Cause I'm--The rest of the guys had--weren't pursuing this. I was the only one pursuing it. But anyway, I had them all in court. I had all the Spaniels there. I had, you know, everybody--I had all my crew there. I had to bring some of them in from out of town to be in on this set. Now image--imagine this, if you will. I'm sitting up in the chair being questioned. And this lawyer comes over here with an album like you see out there with my picture on it, with my voice on it and my name on it and says I allegedly made this. I got so--I was so furious. I say, "What are you talking about allegedly." In other words, I was fuming and I--and the judge said, "Calm down." He calmed me down. I say, "Fool that's my name. That's my picture. That's my--if you could play this, you could hear my voice on here. What are you talking about allegedly made this--these songs?" Anyway how this thing--now it was supposed to be open and shut. It was obvious, yeah. I got everybody here. Hey, I say, "Hey, this is him. This is him (laughs). This is him. This is him. This is him. Here's who wrote these songs. Here's whose singing this, and here's whose singing that. I could point it out A-B-C, just like that. So then it--the trial took some--oh, it was not supposed to be a thing settled by--it was supposed to be settled with open arguments and then that was suppose to be it. So this thing took a turn some kind of way where it was not settled with open arguments. It was settled with written arguments. Meaning that the days of court and all this hearing stuff is over and we don't--what's going on now? Then we get a deposition like that. I can't explain to you what this is at all.
Story_ID: 11876
Speaker 1: We get a deposition-like things, trying to--supposedly explaining why we didn't get our royalties. You understand. But we didn't get the royalties and the individuals went on with the--with doing what they were doing. Now you couldn't've told me that we'd have got in Federal court and presented the case and walk out of there with no satisfaction. You couldn't've told me that in a million years. But that happened. That happened.
Speaker 2: So no royalties were ordered paid or--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Not to us. Not to us. Now I don't know what--not to us. No royalties were paid to us at all, period. And none of the other artist like the Dells and Jimmy Reed's wife [Mary "Mama" Reed] and Dee [Delecta] Clark.
Speaker 2: So what was the judicial conclusion?
Speaker 1: I don't know what the judicial conclusion was. 'Cause I never saw the--what it was. And when I went down there--I went down there to see that judge. And he had retired. He retired. And so did the lawyer. And the lawyer--the lawyer left town after that. I couldn't--I went down to his office. He wasn't even here no more.
Speaker 2: Do you remember their names?
Speaker 1: I told you, the judge--the lawyer was [W.] Yale Matheson. The judge was Thomas McMillan. I'll never forget it--who it was. Federal Judge, Thomas McMillan.
Speaker 2: And this was 1970?
Speaker 1: Eight [1978].
Speaker 2: So--I mean, this is gonna seem redundant. But I think you know what I mean. What was all that feeling like when you went through all that and then to know that--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) I--.
Speaker 2: Used and--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Well, (laughs) you want a honest reaction? If I'd a been a gangster, I'd a killed a whole lot of people. I'd a just killed a whole lot of people. You don't talk about it no more. That's how that works. That's how I felt, frankly. That's exactly how I felt. 'Cause I done went through the whole legal procedure. I done followed this whole procedures, A-B-C, like you're supposed to do. I dotted all my I's and crossed all my T's. So what's up with this? I can't even get no explanation what--how--ain't nothing you can say. How you gonna explain that? How do you explain that? The opening day it was stated that you're owed these royalties automatically by what we already proved you sold. We got albums coming all out of Germany, out of Spain, out of England. You get what I'm saying? Wasn't no royalties for us. In the meantime, the group is running around here halfway living in poverty, being buried by--in pauper's graves and stuff. And music is selling all overseas. You see what I mean? So the billions of dollars--yeah it's billions of dollars. Now after all these years, it's been all incorporated into Wall Street and all these big institutions, where you probably couldn't even follow the paper trail now. But if you could take them bricks out of that Wall Street wall, it would collapse. Based on just the strength of that. 'Cause they're not bricks, they're stones. And I--I'm sorry. I felt--that's something that is--I got a rage about that. I got a rage about that. And it hasn't--it's not corrected now. And then you--oh, how I hooked up with the Teenagers [of Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers]. They came to Beverly--I hadn't seen them since the day. But they came to--they were--They did a performance in Beverly, Massachusetts. It was one of those oldie shows. I go into the show thinking, you know, I'm gonna see everybody I know. All the names are there. So I'm going to check out some people I haven't seen in a long time. I get there, the whole show is phony. It's fake. In other words, you got a white promoter. That he's went out and got all of these black people singing in the name of various artists. You understand? I would go to this dressing room and say, "Where are the Flamingos?  Y'all ain't the Flamingos. Where--where are The Drifters man? Y'all ain't no Drifters. Where are the so-and so's?" When I got to the Teenagers--well I knew this before, 'cause I knew 'em when I saw 'em on stage. There were two original Teenagers.  They had their own group there. They were legit. But they had a court trial going on at that time. Where Jimmy Merchant, the ones--whose pictures I showed you. Jimmy Merchant and Herman Santiago were suing to get their rights, writer's rights, especially Jimmy to co-writing with Frankie Lymon, 'Why Do Fools Fall In Love'. So I went down to federal court. I went down from Boston [Massachusetts] to New York to sit in on they trial. I wanted to see how this was going. This corporate lawyer--when Jimmy was sitting in the witness stand, this corporate lawyer, one of the first questions he asked him was, "Why are you still pursuing this?" That was his arrogant audacity. "Why are you still pursing this?" That was the question he asked him. Now, of course, the connotation behind that question is, don't you realize that this is Wall Street. You can't beat this. You ain't gon' get this. Why are you still even trying? They won the case. Now at the time, they were in the making of the picture, 'Why Do Fools Fall In Love', with Lorenzo [sic, Larenz] Tate, I think yeah, playing Frankie. They collaborated on that with them to a degree. And then something went wrong where the people took off and took that thing another way. But they won the case in this court. Started collecting a little money. And guess what? A upper court reversed the decision. Check that out. Yep. So--oh the one thing the judge did leave us, getting back to our trial. The one thing the Judge told us--said this at this last day that we were there. "Well you have the right to reissue and put out any of your material that you want." (Laughs) Thank--thanks a lot (laughs). We had the right to do that.
Story_ID: 11877
Speaker 1: So in these intervening years, what have you been doing?
Speaker 2: I work in Boston [Massachusetts]--well, intervening you meant--well first of all--.
Speaker 1: Between your case--between--.
Speaker 2: '70s [1970s] and now?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Leaving the group and then--and--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Okay.
Speaker 1: You know--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) When I first got--when I first left the group, which was in 1959, that's when I went to work in the steel mill with my dad. I told you he got me a job in the steel mill. And incidentally, my wife-to-be [Juanita Gibson] was from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and I brought her home with me. But we're not married yet.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you--'56 [1956] to '59 [1959] was your first Spaniels group?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Then from--.
Speaker 2: '73 [1973], I got the whole group back together. And the reason I reorganize the group, because first--when I first started calling around, checking out who was putting the music out, I was getting the response, "Oh, the Spaniels are dead," (laughs). I said, "What!" So I told--I said, "Look guys, they're trying to say that we're dead. So that's why we're not getting no royalties." Now [James] 'Pookie' [Hudson], in the meantime, he was singing. He had a group of guys that he was singing with in [Washington] D.C. and going places. But obviously they didn't establish the thing that we had. So-.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Did they call 'em the Spaniels?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: His groups?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So when I had 'em all come up to court I--that's the reason I had 'em all in court to say, "Here, here, here. Who's dead? He not dead. He's not dead. He's not dead. Nobody is dead. What are you talking about The Spaniels are dead? Nobody's dead. They all right here? This is him. This is him. This is him. This is him. This is him. This is me. We look dead to y'all?"
Speaker 1: So when you started--What year was you started back, '70 [1970]?
Speaker 2: I got the group back in '73 [1973].
Speaker 1: Seventy-three, okay--
Speaker 2: See this is when I--.
Speaker 1: (unclear).
Speaker 2: Remember--this is when I went and saw that album?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I started this process and so that--when I regot the group back together--I got a picture in there, that first show we did--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 2: At the High Chaparral [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Were you able to make any money then?
Speaker 2: We made money--now we--the money that we made, we made performing. But that wasn't that great. But we did make money performing. But we never saw a royalty check. You know, somebody messed around and sent me a royalty check about--IB--BMI [Broadcast Music Incorporated] sent me a royalty check about--'Cause I was in contact with BMI guys, talking all of this. You know, I was in contact with everybody that was involved in this thing. And it was just a little Mickey Mouse check. It's for a song that I wrote. It's a little song that I wrote that's been on all these albums, you know. I didn't cash the check. I got the check now (laughs). 'Cause I got--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) How much was it?
Speaker 2: Oh about fifty or sixty dollars or something. Some little Mickey Mouse--Mickey Mouse nothing. But I, you know--I ain't--I didn't cash it. I just put that up. Here this is what a royalty check is (laughs)? Suppose to have--that thing should have had a whole lot more zeros on it (laughs), you know. And this is for a little insignificant song on the--on the albums. This was not a single that was out. I mean most of the songs we had were big by they self. I mean, you know, we had songs--you couldn't go anywhere back there when we were doing--you couldn't go to any place that didn't have our songs all over the juke box.
Speaker 1: How many hits--?
Speaker 2: For example.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Did you have?
Speaker 2: We had several hits. But we didn't have the big smashing hits. Because what happen is, Vee-Jay [Records] came to the point where they got a whole lot of other artists. And so they began to kind of put us to the side. But they wouldn't let us go and record with somebody else. 'Cause I tried to get off of Vee-Jay, when that started happening. But we had 'Baby It's You'. That was big. That was on the charts. 'Goodnight, Sweetheart, Goodnight' was on the charts. We had 'Everyone's Laughs'. In '57 [1957], we had 'Stormy Weather'. All of these were on the charts. They weren't like number ones or nothing. But they charted as we say. You know. And all the other songs or a lot of the other songs were number one on different radio stations in different cities, if you know what I mean. They were number one in certain cities. Like a Philadelphia, Washington [D.C.] and Baltimore [Maryland] and New York. 'Cause we had a circuit that was--anywhere we went, we had a huge following in these places. You know.
Speaker 1: The various incarnations of the Spaniels, were they ever running concurrently? Like was Pookie's group going while your group was going?
Speaker 2: Nah. I didn't have no group apart from Pookie. At--I'm saying that everything that I'm telling you, Pookie was there. You see what I'm saying. Everything that I'm telling you, Pookie and the guys that made the records was there. I didn't have no--I didn't have no fakes. I had the (laughs)--what you see is what you get. What I had was the guys that sang these songs and whose pictures are on these albums.  That's who I had.
Speaker 1: And when you stop performing, what year did you stop performing?
Speaker 2: You mean the first time?
Speaker 1: No, the last time?
Speaker 2: In the early '90s [1990s].
Story_ID: 11878
Speaker 1: And what did you start doing?
Speaker 2: Well I was already doing it. But I was doing it--the singing was kind of part-time. You know. I was still doing that like part-time. But I--I'm--I'm a security supervisor in Boston [Massachusetts]. That's what I do. I been doing that every since I been there, since '88 [1988]. You know. But all through the--All through the '80s [1980s] and '90s [1990s], we were performing. I'm talking about the groups that made the songs. We've--we've done Radio City Music Hall [New York City] in the '80s [1980s]. You know. We done--you know, all kind of places like this, we've been doing over all--over all these years. You know. Up until the '90s [1990s], when I, you know. It kind of tapered off.
Story_ID: 11879
Speaker 1: So your wife [Juanita Gibson], you met her in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 1: And the two of you came back here and you got married--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 1: And you had how many kids?
Speaker 2: I got seven.
Speaker 1: You got seven?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell me something about family life?
Speaker 2: My family life? With her? Oh it's great (Laughs). I mean it was great. I have four sons and three daughters. Now needless to say, having that many kids, we were struggling. But we managed to get a home. And the kids were always healthy and rambunctious and energetic and--and this type of thing. And it was just great. I mean I'd go to work every day. I'd come in. Like I say, I would cook. You know. I--when they got up enough, I started teaching 'em how to sing. But we were doing it just for fun. I never was thinking--I didn't have in mind them becoming professionals. It was an inner--it was just an enjoyment. Just a--you know, like some people would do something else, I like to sing.  So I just showed them. "You take this part. You take this part." And then we'd sing dif--all the songs. The--'Why Do Fools Fall In Love' is one of the first songs I taught them how to sing. You know. And then the El Dorados's songs and, you know, different group songs. And we just did this for fun over the years. And--.
Speaker 1: So any of your kids married? Are you a granddad yet?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Oh yeah, I'm a granddad. My oldest daughter--those are my two grandsons. I showed you that picture with my oldest daughter. She's divorced, but she was married. And my son Daniel whose one of--he's on one of these albums. And he's got a group that performs. I've got two grandsons with him and his wife. And my daughter, Delora married and I got three grandchildren with her. And David doesn't have any and my oldest sons doesn't have any yet. Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you and your wife are divorced?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But you still have a good relationship?
Speaker 2: Yeah. It's friendly.
Speaker 1: Have you married again?
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 11880
Speaker 1: If you had it all to do over again, what would you change?
Speaker 2: What would I change? Well if I had it to do over again, the one thing I would come up--right out of the box learning about is the technicalities of it. The business part of it. You know, like that royalty business. Because, you know, that would've made all the difference in the world of us being able to really stay together. You realize the cushion that kind of money is coming in when you say not performing regularly. And all of a sudden you got these semi-annual lump sums of money coming in. Which is the way royalties are paid. So I would make sure I was up on something like that. I would not be blindsided like that again. You know, for one thing. Well that's all that comes to mind in this context right now (laughs).
Speaker 1: How has your faith helped you in all this?
Speaker 2: It has helped me a lot. Because, you know, the faith has kept me from really hating people. I know--you see that's not--the two are not compatible. You can't have real faith and hate somebody. Because one negates the other one. You know. And plus, hate can't produce anything. But I tell you I got that--I've had to exercise faith. I've had to--I've had to understand the fact that I don't care how long it takes there is a system of justice that's above what human beings do. And sooner or later you cannot suppress that sense--that justice that's due. It's impossible. 'Cause when you--the whole system--you get what I'm saying? It's a crack in the whole system. And it's a crack in the foundation of the system. So I have the faith and confidence that how, I don't know. I can't see the one, two, three steps. That's why it's still faith. 'Cause if I could see it, it wouldn't be faith anymore. It would be understanding. You know. But I have the faith that it will unfold however long it takes. I saw something come up here recently that I never knew. Just talking about our history. This is another reason I wanted to do this. I saw something. It--I don't think it was--It wasn't in conjun--connection--It wasn't connected to this organization. But an excerpt came up about this place out in [Tulsa] Oklahoma. This--It was like blacks had a community out there that was a--They called it Black Wall Street [race riot occurred in 1921]. And you know, this black got accused of raping this white woman. And then the whites came in there and killed all the blacks. Burned up their homes and everything. I mean this was something--this is a history I had never heard. And these people are going for remunerations. Now the arguments against remunerations is that nobody's living that--to get 'em. But they are living people who lived through that, that kills that argument. You know. They verify the argument for remunerations. Because just about everybody else has gotten them. The Japanese got remunerations. Jews got remunerations from these Swiss banks and everything. And you better believe that blacks in this country deserve remunerations for slavery. You don't pass over that like, "Oh that was yesterday. That was nothing." Yeah that was something.
Story_ID: 11881
Speaker 1: What did you think the legacy was of the doo-wop artist and other artist in the period from the '50s [1950s] to '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) That was--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously)--actually in the '40 [1940s], '50s [1950s], '60 [1960s]s--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) The legacy?
Speaker 1: History (laughs).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What do you think the legacy of all that missing out? What is that going to come to? Or what has it come to?
Speaker 2: Well think about this.  Any knowledgeable person about this music knows it's not missing. Even though they don't wanna acknowledge it the way it should be acknowledged. Because to acknowledge it as the foundation is to acknowledge all the rest of what I'm telling you about. So therefore, they don't even wanna acknowledge the reality of the fact that this is the original music. From the '40s [1940s]--I grew up on the '40s music.  I grew up on--my folks had those [Thomas] 'Fats' Waller and all of those and Louie Jordan and all these black artists. I know they never saw a royalty check. That word wasn't even introduced into nothing. You know. You know what? They used to call Atlantic Records "the house that Ruth Brown built." The house that Ruth built. 'Cause all those hits she had. You remember Ruth? You know who I'm talking about? 'Mama, Treat Your Daughter Mean' (laughs). So--but I don't know how the legacy is gonna come out. But I do know that--for example, I'll give you a case in point. All those--all of those artists out of England--all those artists out of England, the Beatles, the Roll--all of them, they whole foundation is black music. Take all of what they know--learned from black music away from them, they got nothing. They got nothing to do what they doing today on. None of 'em, period. They don't. The Beatles, when they first came to this country, no white label would pick 'em up. They came to Vee-Jay [Records]. Nobody knows that. The Beatles were on Vee-Jay Records before they were anywhere else in this country. That's not a widely known fact. But it is a his--an historical fact. Then they got here and learned the white/black thing and that was that. You see what I mean? But they came here with the at--you see what they made a beeline for, because this is what they had been listening to.
Story_ID: 11882
Speaker 1: Rap music found a way around distribution--and it ended up that the corporate community came to the rap--.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --creators.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So give me your comment and take on distribution which we're just starting?
Speaker 2: The rap--here's what the rap artists did. First of all, they were cut off from our music. They weren't exposed to--for example, I grew up listening to Louis Jordan, [Louis] Armstrong, the Ink Spots and all that. They didn't grow up listening to us. They didn't grow up hearing no Spaniels and Dells and El Dorados and--they didn't grow up hearing that music, because they had put this music in a category and on a shelf and excluded it from the mainstream of everything. So they didn't have this. So this creativity that they came up with, you know, taking samples of this and that and the other, I thought that was ingenious.  You know what it reminded me of, them being able to do something like that? Have you ever walked down a street and seen where grass is growing up through a sidewalk? I mean the sidewalk could not stop this natural process. That's the point of that. That's the point of that. In other words, they had the natural talent and ability to do this. And it came through, even though it didn't have the foundation it should have had by them being exposed to everything we did. 'Cause if they'd've came up with this having been exposed to everything we did over all these years, everything they had would have had a different flavor. Because irrespective of the fact--have you ever thought about this? We came through the '60s [1960s]--I mean the '50s [1950s]. You know. We talking about the '50s [1950s]. When they were still hanging black people in the South. When Emmett Till was found like he was found. And yet our songs don't have no hatred in them. Think about it. The theme of our songs does not have hatred. Why do people still like to come to these oldies shows? Because they walk out of there feeling uplifted. Because the songs are about love. The song are about good relationships. Because we had those kind--we were singing about what we--what we were experiencing in spite of that. In spite of that, this is what we were experiencing. You know. The rappers weren't. I mean this is after the time that, you know, the drugs and guns are dumped into our communities. You know. Ain't no black gun manufacturers. So they're singing about what they experience and without the benefit of even having the influence of their own heritage, like we had. I don't know what we would've come up with if I hadn't've had the Ink Spots and all them in my ear. Sonny Till and the Orioles. You know, I had all of them in my ear.
Speaker 1: So distribution would help? What other kind of things do you think would help--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I--.
Speaker 1: Artist get over--get around?
Speaker 2: Primarily distribution. Because it means that, okay. They're buying the music. They're buying all of our music everywhere. They're buying the oldies but goodies. They're buying the rap. They're buying the music. But it's got to go through these people, these middle people that are, you know, determining and taking half of it or whatever off the top.  So if we had our own distribution where we could get the music--the demand--we could meet the demands where it is without the intermediaries, then we'd be getting the money that's our money anyway.
Story_ID: 11883
Speaker 1: What do you see as your personal legacy for your family, for future creative artist in the music industry?
Speaker 2: Well they have this story. They have what happened firsthand and they have the talents and the skills and they have the music and they have more education than I have. Therefore, I think they are equipped to take this up and whatever it takes to meet it and--if it don't happen when I'm still here. And to master it.
Story_ID: 11884
Speaker 1: Now is there anything I didn't ask you that I should have?
Speaker 2: No. You asked--I already told you about the evolution of the singing. Except I don't think I went into the gospel part. Did I?
Speaker 1: No. No, you didn't.
Speaker 2: Okay. We sang gospel before we sang with the Spaniels. That's James ['Dimples'] Cochran, 'Dimp' and myself. See he was the lead singer. He became the lead singer for the resident Gary, Indiana gospel group who were called Joiner's Five Trumpets.  They were renowned in Gary. You know. And so--and I got to sing with them too. Because they had quite a few members, because most of the members worked in the steel mills. So at any given time, there would be somebody who couldn't perform on a Sunday, because it was his work schedule. So there was somebody else to take his place. So that they could go ahead and perform. But this is back before we were in the Spaniels now.  We also formed our own little popular group called the Medallions. And I think a group came out with that on the record before we could do anything. So we changed our name to the Montereys.  But we performed around Gary, you know, as teenagers. As teenagers at the little high school things and the skating rink and stuff like that. And we did shows. When different groups would come in town like The Flamingos or somebody. We were the opening act for them. And getting back to the spiritual thing, the Five Trumpets sponsored all of the spiritual groups. We'd bring Sam Cooke and the Soul Stirrers to Gary and the Swan Silvertones and the Pilgrim Travelers. We'd bring all of these groups to Gary, the Nightingales, you know. We'd bring all--all these groups to Gary. So I got to watch all of these--people perform live. I got to watch all of these great groups in person, you know, at their peaks when they were, you know, really in their prime and everything. And the flavor that we got--in other words, we learned all the gospel cords and everything. And I'm saying, that flavor we brought to rhythm and blues. That's the flavor of rhythm and blues. That's the foundation of rhythm and blues really. See. And the foundation of that is actually, you know, Negro spirituals. Which Negro spirituals is one of the--if not the only authentic American music. All the rest of the music was brought in from Europe somewhere. This music originated here. And out of it came the rhythm and blues, the gospel and all and then the rock and roll. Even the terminology, that's our terminology. You know. Shirley [Goodman] and [Leonard] Lee, (singing) "Come on baby let the good times roll. Come on baby let me rock your soul." They even got the terminology from us. See--you see what I mean? So the music is ours--and it's like when you listen to Little Richard, what would you call what he was doing back then before they called it rock and roll? What was he doing? Tell me what--What was he doing?
Speaker 1: Gospel?
Speaker 2: No, I mean his--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) (unclear).
Speaker 2: I mean his--his--his contemporary songs.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: It wasn't labeled rock and roll yet. But Little Richard was already doing this. This is what I'm saying. It wasn't labeled rock & roll. You know.
Speaker 1: And heavily influenced--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) 'Tutti Frutti,' you know, 'Tutti, Frutti'.
Speaker 1: The piano thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That was gospel.
Speaker 2: Oh you absolutely right (laughs).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously laughs).
Speaker 2: Absolutely right.
Speaker 1: (Laughs).
Speaker 2: Absolutely right. So that's one of the reason that the music is so lasting. 'Cause it has a genuine foundation. It has a genuine musical foundation. And any real music--I mean just because somebody can sit up and play something out of they head, that don't necessarily mean it's real music. You know. Because frankly, if you sit up and listen today, the majority of what you listen to is simulated some kind of way. Meaning it's not either--either it's not real instruments or they got so much mechanical stuff to make sound this way that the person that's there, they can't--they can't do that. When you came to see anybody in the '50s [1950s], they were doing exactly what you hear. When you listen to those '50s [1950s] records, that's exactly what it is. It's not enhanced. It's not duplicated. It's none of that. Because that engineering didn't exist. It didn't exist at that time. It was pure, real music. And it was untutored. Meaning didn't nobody go to school to learn that. No. We taught each other. I don't mean nobody learned it. But it was untutored. Nobody sat up in a classroom and, "Well now you learn--You went--." no.
Story_ID: 11885
Speaker 1: Okay. So is there anything else--any comment you wanna make other than what we discussed?
Speaker 2: Just that we're gonna continue to pursue what is rightfully ours and even through the next generation. I mean it's just not gonna be that we all pass away and then the music is all in their hands. You see, you know what I'm saying? That ain't gonna happen. That's not gonna happen. That's not gonna happen. Now how exactly it's gonna unfold, it will unfold. Just like I--I watched a lot of different things unfold over the years that you never knew and never expected how that would happen like that. You know. And prayer is answered. You have to learn--you know, I've learned one thing. You have to learn how to pray. It takes a long time to really learn how to pray. 'Cause a big segment of praying is not just asking God something. It's understanding how His system works where when you are set and you know you're right, you expect it. And He fulfills righteous expectations. Otherwise there would be no system of nothing in the universe, if that wasn't the case. And the highest level of man's application of it is--is--is--it's like striking a match and holding it up to the sun. It's nothing. You know.
Story_ID: 11886
Speaker 1: So this is a contemporary shot. Well why did you have this photo made?
Speaker 2: Well just for that reason to just have a contemporary shot. 'Cause everything else is several years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And this is a digital shot he was playing with.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I and I want, yep--.
