Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had some media training about fifteen years ago, and they taped us and we saw what those things were and so we actually worked to condition ourselves to not do those things.
Story_ID: 260678
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Andre J.] Hornsby let's begin talking about your mother, would you please tell us your mother's name, where she was born and where she spent her childhood and where she grew up as a girl?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Leatrice Theresa Delpit [Hornsby].
Speaker 1: Could you please spell that for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) L-E-A-T-R-I-C-E, T-H-E-R-E-S-A, D-E-L-P-I-T.  She was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, and that's where she spent I would say the first; I don't, twenty-eight years of her life.
Speaker 1: And did she ever share any stories with you about what life was like for her growing up as a girl?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had a, I lived in an extended family household.  As a young child in the household was my great-grandmother, my grandmother [Vinita Delpit (ph.)], my mother, my father [Rogers Hornsby], my brother [Rogers Hornsby, Jr.], my mother's youngest sister, and my mother's sister above her youngest sister. We were a very close-knit family; we had dinner together every Sunday at somebody's house in the family.  It was five brothers; it was one brother and four sisters, which is my mother's immediate family.  My father had two brothers, and a grandmother.  And Louisiana people back then under separate but equal in the '50s [1950s].  We were very close-knit families; we did picnics, church all those kinds of activities early on in life.  So I have a lot of historical references because I mean I, my great-grandmother I would read to her when I was a little boy.  I started reading very early in life, and I would go sit in the room with her and, 'cause she was a diabetic and she had broken her hip and she could not get around.  So she was not mobile without help or in a wheelchair, so I would stay in the room with her and keep her company after I would go to school during the day.  I'd come home, my grandmother would have cooked and cleaned and getting ready to go to work herself.  She cleaned a, a bank building at night, and my parents were both working and so that's kind of the early.
Speaker 1: And what kind of work did your mother do?
Speaker 2: Seamstress, she was a seamstress all of her life.
Speaker 1: And would she go out of the home to sew?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah my mother and her oldest sister and her second sister were all seamstress, my mother and her oldest sister ended their careers as seamstress.
Speaker 1: And how would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: A small lady, very powerful voice a very independent thinking person one who believes what she believes and one who's willing to accept life's consequences based on what she believes.  She doesn't allow others to shake her confidence, she, she's an interesting lady, very interesting.
Speaker 1: And does your great-grandmother ever talk to you and tell, not talk to you but tell you stories about her childhood and what life was like for her?
Speaker 2: I learned probably more about my, my great-grandmother through my aunts and uncles.  My great-grandmother spoke broken French Creole, so she could speak English, but she also spoke a lot as she got older in French Creole.  I think it was sort of regressing back to what she was very comfortable with.  No she would just enjoy me reading to her and she would reward me like she'd give me a nickel where I could go to the store and get something.  You know we had neighborhood little stores where in the house where somebody was selling stuff.  And I would walk up the block and go buy something at the store, and probably bring her something back.  They always gave me little responsibilities when I was a very young child, and gave me parameters under which to do those things so.  She was, she was a very special woman, I had a lot of women in my life to influence me and to shape me in my development as I was growing up.  And my great-grandmother and grandmother were very influential in the early years.
Speaker 1: What was your great-grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: My great-grandmother's name is oh, god this is bad, let me think about this one for a minute.
Speaker 1: Okay and if it comes to you just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It, it will.
Speaker 1: So we'll have it as a matter of record.
Speaker 2: It's Grandmother Taylor [ph.].
Story_ID: 260679
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit now [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Andre J.] Hornsby about your father, starting with your father's name, where he was born and where he spent his childhood growing up.
Speaker 2: My father's name is Rogers L. Hornsby, R-O-G-E-R-S it was L for Leo, and Hornsby, H-O-R-N-S-B-Y.  He was born in Plaquemine, Louisiana; Plaquemine is right outside of Baton Rouge [Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Could you spell Plaquemine?
Speaker 2: It's P-L-A-Q-U-E-M-I-N-E.  He was born on the land that their father had purchased early on that-- we come from a family of builders and a family of wheelers and dealers in land.  Ever I, I've looked actually back in the land transfer documents in Louisiana, and when they were slaves.  And they were still in the real estate business of helping slaves sell land or acquiring land from slaves and selling the land, they were also slaves.  But slaves were allowed to transact this type of business back then and it actually shows up in the, the rolls.  The tax transfer documents back in the 1800s.
Speaker 1: And how did they come about the land, was it something that like the plantation owners or their owners had given them?
Speaker 2: No, I think, I think some of the land was land that other slaves were given by their plantation owners when, when you had it was 1864 when slaves were freed.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They just booked; they left Louisiana and went north.  It's like they didn't trust the fact they were given this land under the land grants that were given back then.  So they would sign this land over to people like my grandfather's father, not my grandfather.  And they were involved in the transfer business; it's interesting, my grandfather signed with an X.  And he had to have a brother, had to have a sister and an uncle to witness any land transaction.  Because back then, you know what did they have to really know who was whom, so those documents required at least two witnesses to verify that the person who was signing to transfer the land as it was being sold was actually the person that was supposed to be.   And so my, my father grew up between the City of Plaquemine and then back in the bayous which is where they spent a lot of their life.
Speaker 1: What kinds of things did he share with you about his life growing up?
Speaker 2: I never met my grandfather, my grandfather died when my father was four and a half.  My father had four brothers, one brother Darius [ph.] died when, he died six months before my grandfather.  My grandfather died six months after that, so my grandmother [Arabella Lyons (ph.)] raised three boys in the town of Plaquemine, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: And how was it that your father ended up in New Orleans [Orleans]?
Speaker 2: Well they all learned to be carpenters and bricklayers; part of the other business that the family was in was logging and lumber.  And so as a part of being in the logging and lumber business, the family was also in all the trades, brick masons, carpenters, electricians, plumbers.  That was all a part of their training as children, and so they learned those trades from uncles, my grandmother's brothers who lived in Plaquemine also were builders.  And they built homes; they actually were one of the oldest families that moved homes.  We actually have archival pictures on my grandmother's side of the family where they used to move homes with trees.  You actually see horse drawn houses that are being pulled along the roadway and they moved the logs to the front of the homes.  And the logs wouldn't allow the house to roll, back then in order to move a building from one location to another.  So it was all part of--we've always been in the building trades one way or another on my father's side of the family.  And interesting enough that also existed on my, my grandmother's husband's side of the family.  They were also in the lumber business. It's weird, how--
Story_ID: 260680
Speaker 1: That happens (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) How did your parents [Leatrice Delpit Hornsby and Rogers Hornsby] meet?
Speaker 1: My parents met when, god I guess my mother was not too long out of high school.  They met at a social club dance back in Louisiana, the, the black social clubs which still exists today.  And as a part of the Louisiana culture, separate but equal had their own social clubs and they gave these big events on an annual basis.  And a portion of those events was dedicated to people getting to know each other, and that's how they, they first met at one of the social club dances.  My mother was a dancer, she loved to dance.
Speaker 2: And how would you describe your father?
Speaker 1: One of the hardest working people that I know in America, I understand why I have this, this drive to work.  He had it all of his life until he was injured at a, fairly young age for a man.  He was living in California when he actually got injured but he was a carpenter, he learned the brick masonry.  What he didn't learn from his immediate family when he moved to New Orleans [Louisiana] at a young age in his twenties, he begin to work with one of his uncles.  One of my grandmother's brothers who owned a construction company in Louisiana back in the '40s [1940s], '50s [1950s], and so that's where he learned the trade in working directly with one of my unc- one of his uncles, my great uncle.
Story_ID: 260681
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit now about your grandparents, I know that you didn't know your maternal grandfather--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but what about your maternal grand- I'm sorry your paternal grandmother.  Did you ever spend time with her?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: My grandmother, she was a very petite woman, she was 4'11".
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: She--very dynamic personality, pretty woman, she owned her own business.  I knew her early on, we called her Mamaw [ph.], Mamaw had her own restaurant, barbeque business right on Elysian Fields Street [sic. Elysian Fields Avenue] in New Orleans [Louisiana].  That she sold in the early '60s [1960s] because they were putting I-10 Interstate 10 through New Orleans going you know from east to west.  From Florida to California and they actually acquired her property. When they acquired her property in the '60s [1960s] she moved to Los Angeles [California].  She was up in age at that time, so she was retired, she never worked anymore after she sold her business.  But she made some barbeque sauce that was, I think it's, it's some sauce that is shown up over the years with other companies.  They actually tried to buy her recipes, and she refused to sell them, mistake on her part you know.  Sometimes you don't know the benefit in the wealth of what you have when you have it, and we believed that it still showed up in another name later on.  You know people do chemical analysis, they know how to make stuff the way it was.  But it was very famous barbeque sauce and people would come from all over to buy her barbeque.
Speaker 1: And when we talked a little bit about your maternal great-grandmother, but what about your maternal grandmother, oh, I'm sorry, your paternal grandmother, what was her name?
Speaker 2: Vinita [ph.].
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Delpit.
Speaker 1: Okay, now your maternal grandmother what was her name?
Speaker 2: Let's see if I got this right, my maternal grandmother's--my mother's [Leatrice Delpit Hornsby] grandmother.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Who is Vinita Delpit, my paternal grandmother is Arabella [ph.], would've been Arabella Hornsby.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it was Arabella Lyons [ph.] as I knew her, because she remarried, I would say in the '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So now your grand, now was your grandmother the one who owned, your maternal grandmother did she own the barbeque?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, so let's talk about your maternal grandmother.
Speaker 2: A very influential woman in my life, I saw her everyday of my life for the first five and a half year of my life.  Every morning I would wake up with her and she would do the normal duty, we lived in a house all of us together.  And I would, she would drink her coffee and I would eat breakfast with her, and my grandfather's brother, his name was Uncle Hervie [ph.].  He would always come by every morning and he'd either bring fresh doughnuts or he'd bring French bread.  And then one of my uncles, my mother's oldest sister's husband, Uncle Larry [ph.], who was in the antique business, he would come by about nine o'clock every morning.  And he would have a cup of coffee with my grandmother; it was kind of like a central point.  And at some point in time another one of my aunts would come through or another one of my uncles during the course of the day before, before I started going to school.
Story_ID: 260682
Speaker 1: I started going to school actually at two and a half.  It was a interesting opportunity for me to start school at two and a half.
Speaker 2: I'll say, how did that come about?
Speaker 1: It was a neighborhood school; it was, I would say very similar to Montessori, it was called Martinez [Kindergarten School, New Orleans, Louisiana].  Martinez is a very recognized school in New Orleans [Louisiana], a lot of very influential people went to Martinez in some point in time during their careers; it was private.  Because my grandmother [Arabella Lyons (ph.)] was working because they felt I needed to be in school, I was in the probably in advance.  I would say a very advance child so they decided that it would be best for me to go to school.  So I went to school, it was at least six hours a day that we would go to school, they would drop me off to school every morning, and we were in a one room school house.  It's a big room where you had children anywhere from my age upwards to the age of five or six in the same room.  And we were all allowed to learn based on our own pace, so I begin to learn, I, I was reading at a very young age.  And I learned that just because I was in the room with the older children, so as they were learning how to read, I sat there and learned how to read right with them.  As they learned to do mathematics, I sat there and learned how to do mathematics right with them.  I don't know if the people who ran the school understood the impact they were having on the children that were a part of the program.  But it was the type of program that everyone sought to put their children in, and it was in the 7th Ward of [New Orleans] Louisiana.  And for people who know something about New Orleans, the 7th Ward was a, a neighborhood where Creole blacks tended to live.  And it was a mixed community back then, you had whites who lived in the community along with Creoles and, even though it was separate but equal.  When you left the neighborhood, when you were in the neighborhood there was, there was no difference.  I went to kids of all races homes early on and I didn't know the difference and nobody tried to make me know the difference except when I left the neighborhood.  Then they taught me the differences, so that I could understand what those things were.
Story_ID: 260683
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Andre J.] Hornsby tell me what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh I, I can go back quite a ways; I can remember a number of events that was occurring in my life early on.  I can, like I said I can remember sitting in reading to my, my great-grandmother in the backroom of the house.  She died when I was four and half, but I can remember, I sat in the bedroom with her and I read.  I had all kind of books that you know the little storybooks, the little nursery rhymes, all those you know Jack and Jill ran up the hill, all those books from back in the '50s [1950s].  I could read those books to her, and I had a whole shelf full of books and like I said I remember her giving me money, rewarding me for reading to her.  And she'd ask me to go to the store and I was real young, they would give me a note and the money.  And I would go to the store with the note and the money, I'd give them the note, I'd give me them the money, they give me the goods, they'd give me the change back.  And I could always buy myself something, and then I would go back to the house and this within the same block, so I wasn't really leaving the community.  Everybody knew each other, everybody knew each other's children, everybody protected each other's children.  People sat on the porch, it was not uncommon for you to pass people along the way, you spoke to everybody, everybody spoke to you.  It was part of the culture of the community that existed back then, I remember those things very well.  I remember my great-grandmother's funeral; I was away at school the day she passed.  When I came home that day, I was told that she had passed, and that she would not be back. And I accepted that, and I understood that, and I was told we were gonna go to her funeral.  I remember going to her funeral, I remember kneeling down by her casket with one of my little cousins.  He was eight months younger that me but we were there together, we ate doughnuts, it was a celebration of her life.  Those are, I, there's so much I can tell you about.  Riding the streetcars, I can remember riding streetcars.  I can remember riding the back of the streetcar, the back of the bus.  I was an anemic child early on in life, so I had to get shots twice a week; they gave me booster shots twice a week, because I was not a meat eater.  But I became anemic to chocolate milk, I loved chocolate milk, wouldn't drink white milk only chocolate milk.  I wouldn't eat meat, I ate a lot of different vegetables and stuff like that, I was almost like a vegetarian for the first three and half years of my life and when they found out I was so anemic, that it had significantly lowered my RBC's, my red blood cells, that they put me on Ovaltine.  This is how much I remember about this, they put me on Ovaltine to kind of wean me off of chocolate milk.  Because back then we were getting the, my grandmother would get me a you know a quart of chocolate milk everyday, fresh 'cause the milk man came by, leave it on the porch every morning.  I mean I can remember all these things.  These are very vivid memories, and I'm talking about between the ages of three to five and a half.  These are very routine, very strong memories.
Story_ID: 260684
Speaker 1: What was the name of the street that you grew up on?
Speaker 2: [A P] Tureaud [Avenue, New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: And you described it a little bit for us but can you kind of you know delve a little further into that and really describe it for us and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure.
Speaker 1: Was there like a corner store, you talked a little bit about going to the store and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was, it back, back, the homes in Louisiana were built side by side; there was no such thing as a front yard.  You had a sidewalk in front of the house and then you had the street.  If you had a yard, it would be in the back behind the house, most of the homes had a little alleyway on the side of the house that you would get back to.  They had a gate on the side of them, these homes were built quite high, but they were, there was only one, two-story home in the neighborhood that I grew up in on both sides of the street.  It was owned by a white family, as I look back on the neighborhood, I can, I can remember where we had a black family versus a white family.  And look at it as the neighborhood began to change when I was a young child, I, I left New Orleans [Louisiana] actually when I was very young, five and a half.  But I can remember the fruit salesman coming down the street, he'd be on a, a wagon with a horse, horse drawn wagon and they'd sell fresh fruit right off the wagon. And they'd sing you know watermelon you know, and they'd talk the other fruit and two for a dime and you know I got fresh peaches and I got fresh apples and you know get your oranges.  I mean they would sing this song you know as they came through the neighborhood and you'd see all of the, the ladies, the grandparents or mothers come out of their home and go to the fruit guy and, and you know bargain for fresh fruit right there in front of the houses in the neighborhood.  The streets were not, were not paved then, they were shell; they were actually made out of shells fresh out of the ocean.  That was what over the streets themselves, later on they eventually blacktopped.  But we had like a, a little sewer drain outside, it was open, it was not buried, it rained quite a bit, Louisiana was underwater.  So when it would rain, the water would fill up in the streets and then it would go out the drainage systems that existed at that time.  Very old neighborhoods, these were not new homes the homes the home that my, my father [Rogers Hornsby] and them purchased, it was in the '50s [1950s] that's the only house I ever knew in Louisiana.  So they owned that home when I was born, and that's the house I grew up in, it was a one-story house, it only had two formal bedrooms.  It had a living room; it had a little den in between the back bedroom and the kitchen that my father and his brothers built onto the house.  'Cause it do not have that when they first bought it, so they added a bedroom and a kitchen on the back of the house, which almost doubled the size of the house (laughter) you can imagine.  But all those family members now lived in the same house.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: I slept with my grandmother [Vinita Delpit (ph.)] most of the time, as I was growing--actually when I was a little baby, I slept between my two aunts in the front bedrooms, my mother's [Leatrice Delpit Hornsby] youngest sister and the sister above her.  I think one of the pictures has one of those sisters in there, I was her baby, she took me everywhere, she said I was her little boy.  And she, she carted me all around; she was a college student at Xavier University [of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana] at that time.  Very interesting, very close-knit, very secure nurturing environment.
Story_ID: 260685
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Andre J.] Hornsby tell me what sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up.
Speaker 2: I can remember gumbo being cooked. I can remember shrimp creole. I can remember my red beans every Friday with my pork chops.  Well sometimes I had to have fish for you know religions reasons.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know we weren't supposed to eat meat on Friday.  The sounds I can recall of the music in the '50s [1950s] all of the rock and roll music, Chubby Checker, I mean I was in New Orleans [Louisiana], the jazz all of those sounds.  My grandmother [Vinita Delpit (ph.)] would take me to the French Quarter when I was a little boy, so I had all the experiences of Mardi Gras.  I was definitely raised in that culture, that Louisiana culture of what Madi Gras was.  I remember vividly separate but equal, I remember signs, I remember sitting up in the balcony of a movie theater with chicken wire in the front of it.  Because blacks went upstairs, whites went downstairs, very vivid.  When we got on the bus, I know it was the back, when we got on the streetcar, I knew it was the back.  As a young child, what was interesting, I told you about mixed neighborhoods, it was like before I got a suntan; the, the white families could take me places.  And they would just kind of look at me and they wouldn't say anything, but as I would go out in the sun and get tanned, then my grandmother would explain to me why they stopped taking me places.  Because they could no longer slide me in with their children and get, so I got a mixed kind of exposure, not really knowing what I was getting.  Not really knowing some of those other things. But I understood we had two amusement parks, we had Pontchartrain Beach [New Orleans, Louisiana] and we had Lincoln Beach [New Orleans, Louisiana].  And you can imagine which beach was the black beach, it wasn't Pontchartrain, it was Lincoln.  But we did have an Olympic size pool at Lincoln Beach it was a wonderful amusement park, swimming facility right there on the beach, doesn't exist anymore, and all of those things you, you remember in life.  I mean, you know I remember my brother [Rogers Hornsby, Jr.], he's five years older than me, he was very jealous of me.  We were very competitive of, with each other, probably why we're so close today.
Story_ID: 260686
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Andre J.] Hornsby if you would please give us your siblings' names and their birth order, including yourself.
Speaker 2: My brother's name is Rogers L. Hornsby [Jr.]; he's five years older than me.  He's my only birth sibling.  I have stepbrothers and sisters, my parents [Leatrice Delpit Hornsby and Rogers Hornsby] separated when I was very young, five and a half.  My father moved to California with, when his mother [Arabella Lyons (ph.)] moved. In the early '60s [1960s], we moved to Gary, Indiana, so that's my only birth sibling.
Story_ID: 260687
Speaker 1: How was it that you all moved to Gary [Indiana] from Louisiana?  Did your mother [Leatrice Delpit Hornsby] have family there?
Speaker 2: No, no I told you my mother was an independent person, independent thinking, she had a friend, girlfriend that she had worked with in the, in the clothing industry as seamstress.  And her girlfriend had moved to Gary and they had a seamstress, seamstress industry that time, you know in Chicago [Illinois] and Gary that was real big.  So it was easy for her to relocate with us and continue her career.
Speaker 1: And what happened with, the extended family did your grandmother [Vinita Delpit (ph.)] and your aunts move to Gary, as well?
Speaker 2: Oh no, no they all stayed in Louisiana, and for me it was a, it was a triangle in life I call it.  During holidays and summers, I would ride the train either to New Orleans [Louisiana] or to Los Angeles [California].  Sometimes I went from Gary to New Orleans and then to Los Angeles, so I always had interaction with my family, siblings, cousins, throughout my entire life, through that load of relationships.
Speaker 1: And so you moved to Gary when you were about five and a half, six years old?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: And what was it like for you in Gary, do you remember like your first impressions of Gary?
Speaker 2: Oh of course.  It was a black community, it was not a mixed community. We lived with some friends actually in the beginning.  We shared a house with another family for the first eight months that we were in Gary.  Then we acquired a, a home and we lived about two and half blocks from the elementary school [Holy Rosary School, Gary, Indiana] I was attending, a public school.  And like any child you know, you adjust, I had to make all new friends, all new challenges in life, it was very different than the very nurturing environment I grew up in my first five and a half, six years of my life.  And you just adjust accordingly, and you keep moving forward.
Story_ID: 260688
Speaker 1: And what was the name of the elementary school that you attended?
Speaker 2: La- no that was not it, you know, I should've looked some of this stuff up, and I didn't.
Speaker 1: No, that's okay, if it comes to you during the course of our conversation.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But let's talk a little bit now about elementary school, so we talked a little bit about pre-elementary school [Martinez Kindergarten School, New Orleans, Louisiana] when you went to school in Louisiana.  What (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was in first grade at five years old.
Speaker 1: Okay so--
Speaker 2: In Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so what was happening for you academically, here you were excelling in Louisiana when you moved to Gary [Indiana] did you continue to excel academically?
Speaker 2: No, there were some bumps in the road; actually I can remember the elementary school I went to in Louisiana before we left.  I was a very advanced student, we had actually through the school I went to, I begin at two and a half, I had actually read all the basal and done all the math books before I ever that elementary school through the second grade.  When we were, I was in a parochial school, when I was placed in that school, they would not advance me, because they said they would not do that.  That was not their practices nor their beliefs; I was already young at five in first grade.  They recommended to my mother [Leatrice Delpit Hornsby] that she put me in public school, because she said they told her the public schools would advance me based on my ability.  So what I did was I almost played for two years, I hate to say that, I was actually the kind of student, I'd sit in the back of the room and do all my friends' notebooks, because I knew all the answers.  Because I wanted somebody to play with, I was still a young child.  They would place me in the hallway in the desk and they would come outside and I would be gone.  I would go sit in another classroom where the work was more to what I thought it should be, and I would sit in those classrooms and do the work.  And they would come out and find I was gone and probably get all hysterical and then they would find out that I was sitting in the second or a third grade classroom.  Because I could read the books, and I could do the work, and I could participate in the conversations and I was not a probably a discipline challenge versus when I was in the first grade class I was.  I could remember the nun calling on me you know in like in a very angry tone, give me the answer, and I could answer the questions that were on the board.  But yet I wasn't paying attention, because I had done the work.  I mean I could add, multiply, subtract and divide when I started elementary school.  I was reading, I had no challenges with any of that, and that was, I think part of the influence of the program that I was involved in as a young child.  It allowed me to move at my own pace and there was no winners and losers in that environment, it was just if you can excel, you can excel.  If you don't excel that's fine too.
Story_ID: 260689
Speaker 1: Do you ever think back and do you ever think that that like stifled your academic growth or do you feel like you eventually you know caught up to where you--not caught up, but do you ever feel like it stifled your academic growth?
Speaker 2: Yeah, let me give you an interesting slippage and flip you to Gary, Indiana.  And I can remember my teacher her name is Miss Taylor [ph.], because my grandmother's [sic. great-grandmother's] name you remember the name by association.  They thought I was special ed [special education] child because of regional dialect; I'll give you a key word, it's called earl.  In Louisiana, when you put oil in your car, O-I-L, they pronounced it as earl.  And so when I moved to Indiana, they thought I was special ed because I would pronounce certain words a certain way.  Because of the regional dialect and learning how to read, and they figured because I was not phonetically pronouncing the words, I was pronouncing the words as I learned them to mean certain things.  In a different region, it was something wrong with that and for that reason; my mother [Leatrice Delpit Hornsby] took me out of public schools, after that year.  Because they were gonna retain me, and they said well I was young, it wouldn't hurt me and my mother said no way.  You're not retaining him, he's been reading since he was three years old.
Speaker 1: And she knew your ability.
Speaker 2: And she said there's nothing wrong with my child, it's something wrong with this (laughter) system.  And that was the independence in her, and you know she was only a high school graduate, but she knew how to advocate for her children when she needed to.
Speaker 1: And so you went to Catholic school in Gary?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the name of that school?
Speaker 2: Holy Rosary [School, Gary, Indiana].
Speaker 1: Holy Rosary.  And do you remember some of your teachers at Holy Rosary, where they all nuns?
Speaker 2: A mixture.
Speaker 1: There were some lay teachers that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, there were some lay teachers, there were some male.
Speaker 1: Un-huh.
Speaker 2: Teachers.
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of their names in elementary school?
Speaker 2: Not, I did, I prob- I know I have them written down.  Just not off the top of my head.  Probably what I remember most significantly was when [President John Fitzgerald] Kennedy was killed.  Because it was a Catholic school, you can imagine, I remember the nuns crying, I remember the priests coming over the loudspeaker system.  And making announcements about the president had been killed and you know we all had to pray for the president.  And at first you know we didn't know he was dead, he was shot, so we started praying for the president.  Those are things you remember, you know that's like one's of the very significant event, of course I was a young child.  But who, today I know how significant that day was much more so than what I knew at that time.  You know because there was not that bound and connection but I could remember Kennedy's funeral was on television.  We had this little black and white TV, we were out of school, of course nobody was in school on the day of Kennedy's funeral you know so.  You remember those symbolic things that were happening in your life and it just a snapshot but it's something that from the media's portrayal of the event that I can recall, it was a significant world event.  And where people from all over the world were mourning the loss of you know what we knew to be a, the president of the United States at that time.  You know he was how can I say it, he was held in high esteem in the world, naturally life we learned that he was a person like everybody else (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.
Speaker 2: When you grow up, so you remember those things.  And then I was a, I've always been one to challenge, always been one to challenge and I could remember challenging teachers throughout my career.  And I think some of that was some of that was based on where I started, but it eventually began to catch up with me.  And I begin to fall behind, I was not necessarily afforded the, the challenging courses and nurturing teachers who could handle someone like me. I had to be handled there was no doubt about that.  And so what they would do was just pass over me and I could make passing grades without even trying, and so I sort of lingered for a number of years and probably throughout even in going into high school [Bishop Noll Institute, Hammond, Indiana].
Story_ID: 260690
Speaker 1: Let's back up a little bit.  Let's stay on elementary school [Holy Rosary School, Gary, Indiana] for just a few minutes (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was a K8 [kindergarten - eighth grade] elementary school.
Speaker 1: Okay, right.
Speaker 2: It was K8.
Speaker 1: Catholic school.  During the elementary school years, did you have dreams and aspirations like, did you think about what you wanted to be when you grew up, or did that come later?
Speaker 2: No my grandmother [Vinita Delpit (ph.)] always told me that I can be whoever I wanted to be in life, and she said there will be people along the way in life that will discourage me.  There will be people in life who tell me I could not be who I thought I should be, and that I should always remember that I was a, a child of God.  And that my destiny was in front of me, it was not behind me.  And regardless of what happened in life that I should always pick myself back up and get myself back on track.  And continue to have dreams and aspirations of who I wanted to be.  And she always instilled in--and this was at a very young age, I'm talking about--in me that I could be the best at anything I wanted to be.  And that I should never let anyone discourage me and it didn't matter what they said to me, still continue to be true to myself.
Speaker 1: What did you want to be when you grew up?
Speaker 2: Probably I could say that I wanted to be in the building trades as my family it's something I learned at a very, very young age.  I would play in the backyard with my cousins and we would have a saw and hammer and little tool kits.  And naturally my father [Rogers Hornsby] would give me wood and a nail and a hammer and I would be back there cutting on wood and building things.  And I like to take things apart and put them back together, every toy that I would receive, I would take it apart to its smallest pieces, and assemble it back together.  It was just sort of a challenge I liked, and I would do that every year.
Speaker 1: So you thought when you grew up, you'd be a, a carpenter or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Very mechanically inclined, sure very mechanically inclined.
Story_ID: 260691
Speaker 1: Did you grow up Catholic?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was your family Catholic?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What were your experiences like in church, did you like attend Mass, I mean you know every week or every day (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In Catholic school you go every day.
Speaker 1: Right, so when you went to Catholic school [Holy Rosary School, Gary, Indiana], you went to Mass every day.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was the way you started the morning off. And then you would go to school, you start it off at church and then you go to school.  And then--I was an altar boy, I, I got all those experiences.  You, I, I guess because I was a child of the South and because I traveled between Los Angeles [California], New Orleans [Louisiana] and Indiana, I, I begin to understand the difference, the different behaviors associated with racism.  I understood in the South it was in your face, I could remember riding on the train.  When the train got to, got out of Mississippi, they would take the sign off that said for whites only in certain club cars on the train.  And the conductors naturally would ta--I was traveling on the trains by myself as a young child.  And the conductors would watch me, they would make sure I ate; they would make sure I got water and used the bathroom.  And they would tell me okay you can go back to the club car now, we got a seat for you, and I would play cards by myself.  And just entertain myself as a young child, meeting people that, it was just part of the travels but those are things you don't forget.  I began to see where there was favoritism based on color, where teachers would praise one and not another.  Where there was more recognition given to some versus others, I saw it even within the parochial school system.  I became an athlete.
Speaker 1: What sport?
Speaker 2: Football and track, began playing football in the seventh grade, I was very good.  Very athletic, very fast, a lot of speed, I was just an all-around good physical specimen at that time. It actually helped me get into the high school [Bishop Noll Institute, Hammond, Indiana] that I attended.
Story_ID: 260692
Speaker 1: Let's back up one quick second, so during the elementary and middle school years since you went through a school K [kindergarten] through 8 [at Holy Rosary School, Gary, Indiana].  Who was influencing you at this particular time in your life?  Who were you being most influenced by?
Speaker 2: I would say it was a mixture, it was a mixture, my mother [Leatrice Delpit Hornsby] was working, stepfather was working, everybody was working (laughter) probably had a lot of internal drive.  Based on, based on my wanting to be a part of--we played sports in the neighborhood, we would play blacktop football.  Blacktop football is on the streets, we played tackle football on the street and it was concrete, until eventually we started slipping up to the school.  When we could on weekends and use the lawn the only one place we had a lawn was in front of the school.  So naturally you know that's a no-no.  And the principals would drive by and watch you and tell to you to get off the grass and they'd leave, we'd come back.  And so it was my first exposure to what I would consider to be competition, we always raced up and down the streets, and I would always win the races.  I would always outrun everybody, the boys and the girls, very competitive, we played a little basketball, I wasn't that much into basketball.  Not knowing that Indiana was a basketball state, as I grew up I understood that better.  And some of the unbelievable athletes that I you know played sports with during my early years, I later understood probably clearly why I would, I did not chose basketball as a sport in Indiana.
Speaker 1: Now what was your brother [Rogers Hornsby, Jr.] doing this time, he was a little bit older, how was his transition to Gary [Indiana]?
Speaker 2: It was a lot rougher.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Than mine.  He didn't like the stepfather relationship and my mother actually let him go back to Louisiana and live with my grandmother [Vinita Delpit (ph.)].  And that's where he finished high school.  He actually moved back to New Orleans [Louisiana] when he was a sophomore in high school, he was having a difficult time with the transition.  And so we were separated at that point and the only times we really saw each other was when I would go to New Orleans for summers or Christmas holiday and those kinds of things.  'Cause he was five years older than me--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --he was into a lot more than what I was.
Speaker 1: And during the elementary school years, what was some of the things that you enjoyed doing in your spare time.  How did you like to spend your spare time?
Speaker 2: The neighborhood that we grew up in had a lot of wooded areas, we would go ride our bikes, like the trail bikes they have today.  We would take our bikes and do the trails through the woods, dodging trees, in the wintertime because Gary got a lot of snow, very cold winters.  We would you know sleigh ride, we would, we would do tobogganing, we actually slide on cardboard (laughter) or on garbage can tops before we got a, a nice sled, ice skating, always athletic.  Any kind of sport, we would play hockey, I learned how to play hockey, never knew what it was, but some of the kids I went to school with they had hockey.  And they played competitive hockey, and I would just play, because it was another sport for me.  I would do probably any kind of sport, baseball, softball, anything, I was athletic, I was good at.  I always sought out some type of athletic competition, I think, it probably gave me my place in the world, it gave me my niche, it allowed me to make that a focal point in my life.  Because I was rewarded for that, I was celebrated for that, even though my mother and husband didn't really celebrate it as much.  I don't think my mother saw my first competitive football game until I was a junior in high school [Bishop Noll Institute, Hammond, Indiana].  And I had been like; I was on the All-City football team coming out of elementary school.  In the eighth grade, I was a starting running back on the All-City Team.  And you know all those kinds of things, track we won everything, all kinds of awards, but you know my, my mother and you know her husband didn't value those things.  So I got that recognition from other places, either from peers or from teachers or from others who were a part of those leagues and events that sponsored those activities.
Story_ID: 260693
Speaker 1: And what was the name of the high school that you attended?
Speaker 2: Bishop Noll Institute [Hammond, Indiana].
Speaker 1: Could you spell that?
Speaker 2: B-I-S-H-O-P, N-O-L-L Institute.
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I-N-S-T-I-T-U-T-E.
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm sorry.  And you had mentioned earlier that it, your activities in the elementary school [Holy Rosary School, Gary, Indiana] helped you get into high school.  So was this a, a Catholic school as well?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Un-huh.  And can you tell me a little bit about do you remember some of your teachers from high school; were you influenced by any particular teacher in high school?
Speaker 2: I would say that I probably was influenced more by the coaches I was always an athlete, once this got started, it never stopped.  I would say the coaches were very instrumental, I remember my freshman year I actually tried out for three sports.  I played football, I wrestled and I ran indoor and outdoor track, didn't try out for basketball because I was wrestling.  I felt I was better equipped to wrestle than play basketball, but actually I wasn't bad basketball player either.  But I mean my friends were you know 6'10", 6'11".  The starting guards on our basketball team were either 6'1" or 6'3".
Speaker 1: In high school?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Outstanding athletes, high school basketball team was twenty-two and oh [22 - 0] in Indiana my freshman year.  Starting guard averaged twenty-eight points a game, the center was 6'11", the swing forwards were 6'10" each, swing guard was 6'3". That was the starting five.  Very good athletes, very good, very good basketball, very good basketball, most of those guys went to college on scholarships when they finished their careers.
Speaker 1: What was some of your favorite subjects in high school?
Speaker 2: I enjoyed mathematics. I did well in math.  Math was an easy subject for me. I like biology, was good, I liked doing experiments, cutting the frog open, and all those kinds of things.
Story_ID: 260694
Speaker 1: I like black history; we had a black history course we took as a part of our curriculum at the high school [Bishop Noll Institute, Hammond, Indiana].  That was a good course because I learned a lot that I never knew.  Would not have known had it not been for that particular course.
Speaker 2: Do you remember some of things that you learned during that course that were that you didn't already know?  I mean so it wasn't just Harriet Tubman, George Washington Carver.
Speaker 1: That's exactly what it was.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: It was things I didn't know.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I mean you gotta understand now that was not a part of, of our history going from the South to the North.  The North was very institutionalized in how it taught history, it taught U.S. history, and the only pictures you saw in the history books were that of slaves.  On the ship landing on whatever rock they landed at whatever point in time in history.  There was nothing depicting anything positive about African Americans in history books, so it was not until and this was a parochial school, that the books came out I guess this was like '68 [1968] '69 [1969] and naturally I was very in touch now with the, the other side of the history.  The militant side of that which was happening in America, I was very aware when [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] was killed.  I was actually in Los Angeles [California] when the Watts riots broke out, visiting my father [Rogers Hornsby] that summer when they broke out.  I remember the, the National Guard jeeps with the big machine guns sitting at the intersections of the neighborhoods that they kind of were like you know I don't know what they were doing.  But they were there.
Speaker 2: Were you just kind of in awe that all the, or was it frightening?
Speaker 1: Na, for a child none of its frightening.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: You know for, you know when you're a child nothing, none of that stuff frightens you; it's like an event (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: That something happening.  You know we saw the city burn you know they burned the city, I was, I was there you know.  Those are experiences I left there and came back to Indiana, then you had Martin Luther King who was killed, you had riots in Chicago [Illinois].  I was in Gary [Indiana], you had riots in Gary, things burned in both cities, Gary was a predominately African American city.  At that time, it was shifting, they just elected a black mayor, [HistoryMaker] Mayor [Richard] Hatcher, I worked on his campaign as a child.
Speaker 2: What kind of work did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Posting flyers, and walking through the neighborhoods and encouraging people to vote.  I actually ran track on Mayor Hatcher's Youth Foundation [Hatcher Youth Foundation].  I ran track for his track team, he had a city-wide track team.  Very significant events that stick with you throughout your life, I remember the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party].  I can remember a colleague of mine in high school Rap Brown, that's what we called him.  His name was I won't say his full name last name was Brown, he was very militant and he would bring the Black Panther's newspaper [The Black Panther] to school.  Naturally you just had the [1968 Summer] Olympics in [Mexico City] Mexico with Tommie Smith and Carlos, [HistoryMaker] John Carlos and there's one more, Jim Hines.  They won these Olympic gold medals and you know the medals weren't awarded and they put their gloves on and held their fists up.  Those were very vivid live memories for me, 'cause I was an athlete, I ran track so all of those things meant something to me as a young person.
Speaker 2: What did you think about the Black Panther paper like when you would read that, what would you, what was some of your thoughts be?
Speaker 1: It was very right on to me.  I was very much in tuned to what was going on, probably was out there a little bit on the edge, as a young child.  I don't think my parents actually had any idea that I was that actively involved in being somewhat of a militant, even in high school.  I always found a way to get around the rules; I always knew how to beat the rules.  And it probably drove the people crazy who were in the school that were, were trying to decide whether I would be in or out.  And actually if it was not for athletics, I would not have completed that high school.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I was gonna ask you which way did you usually land, so yeah.
Speaker 1: Usually landed on my feet (unclear) and the athletics did that.  If I were not a good athlete I would've been put out of that school, I already know that, because a colleague of mine who was Hispanic, he was not an athlete and they threw him out of the school.  They did put him out, and so I can tell you I understood, I even had to sign a contract, saying that if I violated these rules that they would put me out.  So it was kind of like I learned are--early on that I had to be responsible for my own behavior.  And I turned over a leaf, you know I said you know this makes no sense.  What am I doing?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And I grew within the school and began to take care of the business that I should've been taking care of all along.
Story_ID: 260695
Speaker 1: I started to excel again, and I think the athletics did that you know because they were opportunities for me.  [University of] Notre Dame [South Bend, Indiana] was a college that our high school [Bishop Noll Institute, Hammond, Indiana] was patterned after; one of our coaches was an ex-Notre Dame football player.  And they actually recruited athletes out of our high school.  I can remember Terry Hanratty would come to our athletic banquet for the, the football season.  At the end of the season we actually have Notre Dame active football players who would come and be speakers at the banquet.  And help to recruit kids from our high school to go play at Notre Dame, which was a--
Speaker 2: What were your thoughts about college when you were in high school?  Did you think you were going to college?
Speaker 1: Didn't really have a, a connection, I guess because I didn't have enough of a, a role model to say this is something I should do.  It was like you know you, you can be a contractor, you could be a carpenter.  I had been doing the building trades during the summers; I learned all this carpentry stuff as I was growing up.  I could build a house with no problem, I knew how to read a blueprint I can do that today.  I have done that in my lifetime, but it was a mixed bag, I really you know I had a lot of offers my senior year.  But I got injured, I got hurt, actually I had a severe, a very serious injury, I tore my hamstring when I was running indoor track during my senior year.  And because I was a small athlete, I was only like 158, 160 pounds, but remember I said I ran track.  I was very fast, very quick I could do Palmer Turns [ph.]; I could do anything on the football field.
Story_ID: 260696
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Andre J.] Hornsby, you had an injury your senior year of high school [Bishop Noll Institute, Hammond, Indiana] you were talking about you tore your hamstring (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Tore my hamstring up.  Yeah, and after I tore my hamstring, the big universities pulled back I was--
Speaker 1: What were some of the universities that were interested in you, do you remember?
Speaker 2: Tulane [University, New Orleans, Louisiana], Purdue [University, West Lafayette, Indiana], Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana], [University of] Notre Dame [South Bend, Indiana] in the beginning, but I was a little too st--they felt I was a little too small for them.
Speaker 1: And they were looking at you for football or track?
Speaker 2: Both.
Speaker 1: Both?
Speaker 2: Both, I wanna say Northern, what's it called in Michigan, Northern, Northern Michigan [University, Marquette, Michigan], that was the name of the university.  Montana State [University, Bozeman, Montana], there are quite few schools that was interested because of the speed.  I was you know, I could, I could pick em up and put em down.
Speaker 1: What did that injury do to you mentally?
Speaker 2: Took a long time to recover from that injury.  It actually deflated me as an individual, but it also probably help me to understand that while athletics was good, I needed the academic side.  And I really focused in on making sure I would graduate from high school.  And that was more important to me at that point in time, I continued to compete, but I reinjured myself.  I mean I went through all the therapy, I did everything. Naturally, I was captain of the track team, we felt we had a good chance of winning state, but I was a big piece of that puzzle.  You pull me out of it and then all of a sudden we became mediocre, you put me back in it, we had a good shot at winning a couple of relays individual events.  We really had, and I run track with these guys since we were freshmen, plus the other athletes we picked up along the way underclassmen.  We were really poised to go and win state and it just you know it was, it was tough, it was real tough.  And I understood that there were things I did that contributed to that, it also help me to shift and focus my life a lot better.  On things that I should do that while the environment had certain kind of things going on, I needed to be above that stuff.  And it actually the day I graduated from high school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What year did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-one [1971]. That same day, after all the parties that night, we got in the car and went to Tulsa, Oklahoma.  My mother [Leatrice Delpit Hornsby] had moved to Tulsa my senior year, she was not even in Gary [Indiana] during my senior year, because of they had found another home, a better deal.  Construction business was good, so they relocated through my senior year, and I stayed with friends of the family during my senior year of high school.
Speaker 1: So you guys drive to Tulsa, and what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I worked--
Speaker 1: What happened next?
Speaker 2: In construction, that summer. University of Tulsa [Tulsa, Oklahoma] was also interested in me.  But they didn't offer me a scholarship, they said I could tryout, and it was because of the injury.  I was considering doing that, I actually applied to go, to go to school and then my stepfather and I had a little skirmish and I decided to accept a scholarship in Arizona.  So I went to a community college [Arizona Western College, Yuma, Arizona] for two years in Arizona--
Story_ID: 260697
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Andre J.] Hornsby, I'm sorry I wanna back up just a second and I wanted to ask you as a young man growing up in Gary [Indiana], were you influenced at all by a lot of the musical talent and the music industry in Gary?  Did that influence you at all or?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was, I was all around me but I never pursued music as a talent for myself.  Gangs were real big.
Speaker 1: In Gary?
Speaker 2: Very big, every neighborhood had its own gang.
Speaker 1: Were you a member of a gang?
Speaker 2: If you lived the community you were a member of a gang, you had no option, naturally your parents didn't know this stuff.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.
Speaker 2: But yeah, I knew every gang member, I knew who and what they were and I knew what they did, I knew everything that was going on.
Speaker 1: And so even if you were like an athlete and that you were immune from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well yes are immune in a sense that I could go into any community as star athlete and I was accepted.  I could go into their dances and back then it was a lot of house parties, sure we didn't have a lot of formalize school dances.  They had some but not a lot, but there house parties that I could go in the neighborhoods where I had run over their football team.  And you know it was like it was respect though you know, it's like oh no, not, you know that's Hornsby man, he's all right you know.  Even though they knew I lived in the neighborhood that was where there was a rival gang, it was like they give you a pass.  It's like I could go into East Chicago [Indiana] and its great athletes in East Chicago also back then.  And because it was a private school [Bishop Noll Institute, Hammond, Indiana], we played public schools; it wasn't a private school league.  There were only two big private schools in that part of the country at the time.  And so most of our games were with public schools in Gary, East Chicago or Hammond [Indiana].  That was where the greater part of the northeastern part, northwestern part of Indiana where we competed.  So we knew everybody, we knew each other, we you know had respect and, and so I could go in any community and I always got a pass.  Nobody cared I could talk to their girls, which they just didn't let you do.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.
Speaker 2: Very territorial (laughter) I hate to say that but that was kind of the way (laughter) it was, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: Because of the athletics, there was no problem, none whatsoever.
Speaker 1: And so what, what was the gang culture so to speak like I'm, back you know late '60s [1960s] early '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: Very violent, very violent, you had black on black crime.
Speaker 1: Un-huh.
Speaker 2: You had drugs were becoming prevalent in the communities.
Speaker 1: What drugs?
Speaker 2: Pills.
Speaker 1: Un-huh,
Speaker 2: Marijuana was just coming in, there was some cocaine.
Speaker 1: In the late '60s [1960s] early '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Un-huh.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, and actually the summer I left Gary, there was a huge gang war, you had the Blackstone Rangers [Black P. Stone Nation] in Chicago [Illinois].  We sort of had a relationship with them, and I lived in a neighborhood called Tarrytown in Gary.  We had a relationship where we had an understanding with each other, so we could kind of support each other.  I can remember some of those meetings that were held by the gang leaders of the various gangs.
Speaker 1: So there were actual meetings?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Per?
Speaker 2: Sure, very organized.
Speaker 1: Very organized.
Speaker 2: Very sophisticated.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Very, very influential in neighborhoods.  Did drive-by shootings, all the stuff you hear about today, I remember we were playing on the basketball court, somebody pulls up in a car and they just start shooting.  And well naturally we're splitting, jumping fences and running and (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Wow, so the more things change the more they stay the same, huh (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 260698
Speaker 1: Let's fast forward a bit, so you decide to go to community college in Arizona?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And I'm sorry, what was the name of the school again?
Speaker 2: Arizona Western [College, Yuma, Arizona].
Speaker 1: Arizona Western.
Speaker 2: Western College.
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was in the middle of the desert in Yuma, Arizona (laughter).  The foot, the college was twelve miles out of town; we were I think six miles away from the largest Marine [U.S. Marine Corps] base that exist in the, in the U.S. for training of U.S. Marines.  We, we were located in the middle of a desert; we were surrounded by cactus, sand and wa- and snakes and tarantulas and all those things that people talk about.  Temperatures at night would be a 105 at midnight, in the daytime the heat of the day would be in the 120s.
Speaker 1: So were you ever thinking, okay, I, I signed, and, and this is not what I signed up for?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: You were determined.
Speaker 2: It was my option in life.  I, I understand I had to do this, I had to recover from this injury I had, and I did.  I had to re-pull the [hamstring] muscle, I had to play through with pain and eventually it allowed muscle to heal itself and grow itself back, in order to gain my speed back.  Because one, I mean when you severely pull a muscle, you hear and it pops, pow, you can hear it's like a gunshot going off almost.  And I never had any surgery to reattach anything or anything like that.  Probably should've had some of that kind of treatment but I don't know maybe we couldn't afford it, who knows?  But as we continue to compete, you know it got better and I got better and I started being me again.  I started to compete and I did a good job you know, I went from being a offensive and defensive player in high school [Bishop Noll Institute, Hammond, Indiana] to primarily concentrating on defense when I got into the junior college.  I primarily played a quarterback.
Speaker 1: And were you also 'cause you said in high school when you had this injury that you, it was kind of a revelation for you.  Okay, need to focus a little bit more on the academics, so when you went to college were you also thinking this is not only my opportunity to regain my status as an athlete, but to also (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Get a degree.
Speaker 1: Get an education?
Speaker 2: No doubt about it.  Clearly I can, I can say for the, for the individuals who are part of that institution clearly they would talk to us and tell us how important it was to get the A.A. degree, the Associates in Arts degree.  Because upon completing that degree--this was a hotbed for athletes, when I say a hotbed the best athletes in America were dumped into this conference.  The schools out of California, USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California], UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], [University of California] Berkeley [Berkeley, California], they would dump their athletes that they couldn't get into the school and through regular high school graduation into as a freshman.  So they would put them in this conference.
Speaker 1: The junior college?
Speaker 2: Junior college could go conference back then.  The conference we had the number, out of the top five teams in the country, the top three teams came out of that conference.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: That's how competitive it was, great athletes, I mean great athletes.
Speaker 1: So like a training ground for athletes?
Speaker 2: That's exactly what it was, day I, the day I showed up to go to that institution, I thought I had a scholarship.  When I got there I didn't have a scholarship, there were fifty-eight scholarships available, twenty-eight of them had already been given to sophomores who were returning from their freshmen year.  There were 125 athletes that showed up for the twenty some scholarships that were left.  And at the end of the day, at the end of first two weeks of training camp, I mean every four days there was a notice that would go up on the wall that said whether you made it to the next cut or whether you were being released.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So out of the 125 there were only thirty spaces?
Speaker 2: That's it.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: That's it.  And for the guys who didn't make it at this particular junior college, what they did was refer them to other junior colleges in the conference.  The athletes were just that good; and I'm you know people might remember Chuck Muncie that played for Cal Berkley, the New Orleans Saints.  Chuck and I were suitemates; we actually played in the offensive backfield for a little while when one of the starting running backs got hurt.  They took me off of defense and put me, 'cause they knew I could play offense too.  Leonard Thompson, Leonard played with Detroit [Lions] for a number of years, he was also, I mean, I mean I could you know I can go down the list of guys who--just about everybody went to a division one school when they left.  There was no need for us to be recruited; people were watching us the whole time.  We lost one game in two years, very, very great athletes.  Very great athletes.
Speaker 1: But before the cut, were you thinking, I got this, I'm gonna make the cut or were you not sure?
Speaker 2: I was on my top game; I understood I had to be on top of my game--
Speaker 1: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) to survive.
Story_ID: 260699
Speaker 1: What was the social climate like?  Did you have much of a social life at all (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Well it was just us; I mean we were in the middle of the desert.  What's interesting about that particular university, a large of part of the population was Native Americans.  Because Arizona has reservations and the Native Americans got a monthly stipend, they went to school for free.  So they would get a check every month for them to stay in school, so it was like, I don't want to say social security but I guess it's the way that the government structured its programs for Native Americans who went to college.  So a large part of the student population was Native American and it was also U.S. Marines.  The Marines would take advantage of the college when they were in camp and go to school and take classes and stuff.  To get their degrees and advance themselves, and then you had the community people who lived in the community that participated in the community college.   So it's very diverse, very diverse, not much social though, I mean we're in the middle of the desert and I really mean that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And if you didn't have a car, you didn't go to town.  Every, some of our colleagues from Los Angeles [California] came in with cars you know they were from Compton [California] and you know and Watts [Los Angeles, California] and some of the interesting neighborhoods in L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  And they had nice cars and so we'd ride in town at night to go get something eat.  There weren't any really clubs you had a few social you know one door in and one door out kind of nightclubs.  Remember we were young.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: We could go to Mexico, we could go across the border and we did to socialize sometimes because we were like ten miles from the border, so we could easily get in the car and go to Mexico.  And very diversified athletes, Hispanics [Latinos], blacks, whites, we had a very mix of every, I would say ethnic group that you could imagine.  Had a guy that from was from Canada that was our tight end, very, very diversified, but we were really gelled.
Speaker 1: And so while you were at Arizona Western [College, Yuma, Arizona] what were you thinking you wanted to do with your life?  Were you thinking that you know perhaps football would be a career for you or, or were you thinking of something else in terms of career choices?
Speaker 2: Well I was, I was doing both. I was doing both, I started out as a business major in junior college; I was definitely into computers and technology.  In accounting and probably I had a professor then that described the role of a systems analyst and he aid I would be a programmer.  'Cause back then we were running batch programs, punch cards, these huge mainframe computers we were running.  And he said the life of a programmer was you'd be sitting in this little four by eight office with a three by five desk, no windows.  And you'd be looking at these programs all day trying to debug them and get the bugs out, so the programs will run.  And I begin to think about me as a person, and I said you know what, that's not me; I don't want to do that.  So I shifted my major into education, probably because of the people who had influenced me in the health and physical education, and it was pre-med.  Because this college also trained a lot of nurses, they had a nursing program, so it was a pre-med, education type major that you can get right out of a community college.  So I took anatomy and physiology and you know the normal courses that nurses take (laughter) and I, I was very much focused on my academics.  My freshman semester I took eighteen hours my first semester when I was playing football, I took twenty-one hours my second semester in the spring semester, 'cause we don't have spring football.  So I had nothing to do but go to school, so I went to school, and because I was changing majors, I needed more classes to catch up.  And so I continued to do that eighteen hours, eighteen hours and you know when I finished with my Associate in Arts degree, I had above a three-point grade point average.
Speaker 1: So did you earn your Associates in Arts degree in 1973?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 260700
Speaker 1: Nineteen seventy-three [1973] and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Went to the University of Tulsa in [Tulsa] Oklahoma.  My mother [Leatrice Delpit Hornsby] lived in Tulsa.
Speaker 1: Did you get a scholarship there?
Speaker 2: Not initially.  I had to walk on again, they were still interested in me and I actually walked on and got a walk on scholarship.
Speaker 1: And what was your experiences like in Tulsa?
Speaker 2: Tulsa was very different, and I remembered Tulsa from when I graduated from high school [Bishop Noll Institute, Hammond, Indiana], because that summer that was my first experience in Tulsa, a couple of months.  It was very, very conservative; all the blacks lived in north Tulsa, seemed like it was a dividing line in Tulsa where the blacks lived.  It was very hickey, what they called Friday night or Saturday night activity, everybody would bring their cars to a parking lot and they would sit on their cars and drink and socialize in the parking lot.  There weren't any clubs as such, and then they would race their cars and that is what they considered to be a social activity for the weekend.  And naturally I had come from Gary, Indiana, I was accustomed to going to clubs and dances and jazz bars.  And you know real social (laughter), going to visit in Chicago [Illinois] going to concerts, you know real social.  You know [HistoryMaker Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson had [Operation] PUSH [Rainbow PUSH Coalition] back then, we'd go to Operation PUSH back then so we go to his concerts every year.  So I was accustomed to much more from a social perspective being in and out of New Orleans [Louisiana], I had the same kind of experience.  Being in and out of Los Angeles [California], I had all these other metropolitan type experiences, very urban.  And going to Tulsa was like god, it was a different world, everything ended.
Story_ID: 260701
Speaker 1: The incident with Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] did that happen at (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) [University of] Tulsa [Tulsa, Oklahoma].
Speaker 1: Arizona Western [College, Yuma, Arizona] or Tulsa, okay.
Speaker 2: University of Tulsa.
Speaker 1: So tell us a little bit about that particular incident at the University of Tulsa.
Speaker 2: I, I guess some of my experiences in life, you know I talked about the other influences along the way, the, they, we didn't have a Black Student Union, we wanted one.  It was only one black assistant professor, black female who was on the faculty at Tulsa at that time.  And we were part of wanting the black expedience on our campus, and we wanted things for us, we were paying our fees like anybody else.  We were a part of the program (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you remember what the black student population was at the University of Tulsa at that time?
Speaker 2: Maybe less than three hundred, maybe less than three hundred.
Speaker 1: Un-huh.
Speaker 2: Mostly athletes, most of us were athletes, very few student students on the campus but a few.  Some of my colleagues that we started the ABC [Association of Black Collegians] and I can't tell you today African Black, I don't know, I don't even remember what the acronym stands for today but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But it was a organization for African Americans students.
Speaker 2: That is correct.  And we wanted to bring in Stokely Carmichael as a speaker at the student union; we felt we had just as much right as anybody else.  And that the university had a responsibility in making that happen, we wanted our student fees to go to bring Stokely to University of Tulsa.  And naturally we were told that there weren't any monies available for that, the monies had already been committed to other speakers.  We needed to follow the procedures, we should've done that a year in advance, you know the systematic way of saying no, but yet not saying no but yet saying no.  So what we did was we found a way to raise our own money to and try to negotiate with Stokely to come and said you know, we can't pay an honorarium that kind of stuff, but we'll buy you a plane ticket.  And you know we just want to hear you, and so we had our event with Stokely Carmichael, and since the university wasn't paying for it, they couldn't deny us the use of the space on the campus.  So we had our first speaker, and that was him.
Speaker 1: And, and after that did you continue to have other speakers come in and then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The next year we brought in [HistoryMaker] Nikki Giovanni. Black poet. And we used our student activity money to pay for that, we followed their procedures we got it all in, we requested who we wanted to be the speaker and that was my second year.  And that was my--I was there only there two years, that was also my junior and senior year.
Speaker 1: And do you think that was the beginning of like the activist coming out in you?
Speaker 2: I think I was always an activist. I think I was always one that would challenge a status quo; I was always one that was willing to ask the questions nobody else would ask.  I was one who would stand up for what I believed in, I think my experiences in traveling as I did as a young child, I was exposed to so much.  And it helped to make me, give me a stronger resolve as to who I was.  I knew what it was to be a black in America, you know James Brown, 'Say it Loud, I'm Black and I'm Proud.'  I was part of that whole movement that was the evolution, I was part of the Motown experience, Gary [Indiana] was heavy in Motown back then.  And you know Detroit [Michigan] was where it was, you can't take a black community like Gary and it not be a major focus.  I remember the Jacksons and I remember the first time I ever saw Michael [Jackson] perform.  I think he was five and a half or six years old in the citywide talent show in Gary.  Gary had a citywide talent show, that's where Diana Ross was introduced to the Jackson 5, and she learned the Jackson family, the lived on Jackson Street.  One of classmates in high school [Bishop Noll Institute, Hammond, Indiana] lived on Jackson Street with the Jackson family, so I'd go over and visit him.  They lived right there in the white house on the corner, right by Gary [Theodore] Roosevelt High School [Gary, Indiana], I mean so that was all a part of the social environment, you know what was happening.  Naturally Michael was too young to be socially involved but his brothers were.  You had Jermaine [Jackson] and Tito [Jackson] you know they were more my age group, so that was just part of the social experience.
Story_ID: 260702
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate from the University of Tulsa [Tulsa, Oklahoma]?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-five [1975].
Speaker 1: So in 1975, and did you get your degree in education?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Bachelors of Science in education.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: A B.S.
Speaker 1: B.S.?
Speaker 2: In education.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And so what were you thinking you were going to do with your life at this point?  Had you kind of come to the realization that you were not gonna have an athletic career or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was already into teaching. I already had my teaching experience, I had also volunteered the year before to work with one of the high schools in Tulsa [Oklahoma].  That high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Tulsa, Oklahoma], because I was athletic, I met the coaches, they allowed me to be a, a volunteer coach with the high school. As a part of that experience, they realized that I was a talented athlete and so they really let me train their defensive backs, work with the wide receivers.  Ed Lacy was the head coach, Coach Brown [ph.] was the, was like the number two coach, they allowed me to work up in the booth.  To call plays, to recognize defenses, to let the quarterback know what was the plays in our offense that would work.
Speaker 1: What was that like for you, like kind of going from player to teacher/coach, what was that like?
Speaker 2: It was kind of like I played, then I was a coach, then I played again.
Speaker 1: Un-huh, did you enjoy the coaching aspect?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I really you know and it's, it's so ironic how things happen in life and changes take place.  I actually had and well, let me, let me just say that team was state champs that year, then I went back into my Tulsa experience and became a member of the Golden Hurricane, University of Tulsa.  Very successful football team my senior year, I could've stayed another year, but I didn't.  One of my professors, Mike Davis [Michael W. Davis], he was a professor in health physical education department.  He was instrumental in encouraging me to go to graduate school, of which I did; I went to the University of Houston [Houston, Texas].   And that sort of took me from Tulsa to Houston [Texas], I went down and I interviewed in July after my senior year graduation.  And they gave me a graduate fellowship to teach at the University of Houston and to work on my master's degree.
Speaker 1: And what year did you earn your master's degree?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy--had to be December of '76 [1976], graduation May of '77 [1977].  I was like twenty-three years old.
Story_ID: 260703
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) From there you went on to earn your doctorate degree?
Speaker 1: From there I went--started teaching (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: I actually wanted to continue in school and get my doctorate degree and they told me no.  They said you're too young; you need to go out and teach first, kind of made me a little angry.  And so I did, I went out and I taught in the Houston Independent School District.  And after three, three, four years of teaching experience, I decided to enroll in Texas Southern University [Houston, Texas] for my doctorate degree.  Texas Southern had just begun a doctoral program, probably a year or a year and a half before I enrolled in the program.  I would not go back to the University of Houston [Houston, Texas] because I felt they had rejected me and I felt that it was because I was black. That was just my perception, I, I won't say that was a reality.  I think they were probably very correct in encouraging me to go out and teach and not stay in the university as graduate assistant and work on a doctorate.  I, I think you know as I look back it was important that I do that, and I think (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Why, like what did you learn from--
Speaker 1: Just to develop, I mean I needed the teaching experience; I think they were very correct.  I needed to go out and see if this was a profession I wanted to be a part of, if this is something I wanted to do in life, and I did.  I went out and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What did you teach, what grade did you teach?
Speaker 1: Health and physical education. So I taught kindergarten through sixth grade.  I was part of a fine arts magnet program which we offered strings to our children in kindergarten, first grade we had the Suzuki strings program [Suzuki Program] and I taught the gymnastics part of it.
Speaker 2: What are strings, what do you mean by that?
Speaker 1: Violin.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Suzuki violin program that was the famous program back then that young children started in five and six years old and had these little bitty violins and they learned how to play them.  But I taught the physical education classes at the school in addition to gymnastics.  I had my own gymnastics program; this was in the middle of Fifth Ward in [Houston] Texas, highest poverty, hundred percent poverty in the community.  I don't want to describe the parents other than say that there was a tremendous amount of no parent involvement.  The neighborhood was very laden with drugs and crime, and prostitution, and that's where my children came from.  I loved the children, they loved me we bonded. I developed some outstanding gymnasts, in a very short window of time, very talented group of children, both boys and girls.  I only stayed there a couple of years and then I moved to, they were starting up a new physical development program, it's a magnet school in Houston [Texas] at that time.  And I saw the opportunity for me to expand what I was able to offer children and I left that particular school, Crawford Elementary [School, Houston, Texas] and went on to [Oran M.] Roberts Elementary [School, Houston, Texas].  Which we probably had a second to none physical development program in the country at that time.  We taught any sport you can name.
Story_ID: 260704
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Andre J.] Hornsby one of the things we were talking about off camera was while you were pursuing your doctoral degree [at Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas], you opened a gymnastics school.  Can you tell us a little bit about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I moved from one elementary school to the other from Crawford [Elementary School, Houston, Texas] to [Oran M.] Roberts Elementary [School, Houston, Texas], it was a very affluent community.  I went to highest poverty to one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in Houston [Texas]; it's actually right by the [Texas] Medical Center [Houston, Texas] in Houston which people know.  Those homes were very, very affluent at that time, this is a public school and it was a physical development academy.  And we had a huge gymnastics component as a part of the program, and this was back in the '70s [1970s].  My partner and I, the guy who I eventually opened the business with decided that we were doing so well that we should start up a business.  Why not start up a business, so we, we developed a business plan, got an SBA [U.S. Small Business Administration] loan, small business loan and opened up one of the largest gymnasiums, private gyms in Houston at that time.  We rented an old Oldsmobile dealership and it's a about ten thousand square foot gymnasium that we developed.  We took up a big huge, which was once a garage and converted it to a state of the art gym with all U.S. competitive Olympic equipment and trampolines, and we had the whole nine yards.
Speaker 1: And would you say it was a pretty successful program?
Speaker 2: Very successful, very successful.  We developed; I think one of the first dominant African American female gymnasts at that time, she won state in her age group.
Speaker 1: Which was a little unheard of in terms of African, for African Americans.
Speaker 2: Well this is the early '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: But she, she was doing aerial cartwheels on the balance beam, she could do twisting back flips, one and a half back flips in the layout position.  Her elevation she could, and we didn't have spring assisted floors back then, these were just an inch and a half foam floors.  There was no, what, which a lot of the athletes have today, spring assisted things, very, very outstanding young lady, very outstanding, Venita Green [ph.] was her name.
Story_ID: 260705
Speaker 1: In what year did you earn your doctorate degree from Texas Southern University [Houston, Texas]?
Speaker 2: I think it was 1982 or '83 [1983], it's one of those two.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And what did you do after that?
Speaker 2: I sold my interest in the gymnastics because I didn't see it as something I wanted to do the rest of my life.  Which I can kick myself today, my partner became a millionaire off of that school so I could kick myself.  But I wanted to be what I am today; I decided at that time in my life, my commitment was to become a head of a large urban school district.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Why, why did you, why is that what you wanted to do?
Speaker 2: Because I knew I could influence the future, I knew that I could take children like myself and given the drive and the willingness to compete to transfer that to you know small groups of children as a principal.  And then from a principal in working to restructure the Houston Independent School District and working directly for superintendents.  And then becoming like a regional superintendent of one of the south central districts in Houston [Texas].  Which is what the District Barbara Jordan, Mickey Leland, now Shelia Jackson Lee represents very influential people.  Back then as a graduate of Texas Southern, I, I found my niche I always loved children, I always believed in children.  I, I believed that I wanted to be a part of developing the future; I wanted to touch the future early.  And I knew the way to do that was being able to demonstrate that our children could be as successful as any other group of children in America.  And I believe I was willing to do whatever it took to make that happen, I was willing to push the envelope and people beyond what they believed they could be pushed.  Because I believed that if our children are given the right experiences that they can be as successful as anyone in the world.  And in most instances, more successful, because they tend to, we tend to overcome obstacles that others have not overcome.  And it's just a matter of getting the right recipe in place, and holding people accountable for our children being successful as a part of helping them to believe that our children could be successful.  Part of that is changing the belief system of people who work with our children, so I mean it was very clear about what I wanted to do.  I was in my twenties when I made that decision, so I knew exactly where I was going.
Story_ID: 260706
Speaker 1: And what kind of challenges did you face going from the classroom, still in education but into administration?  I'm sure that had to be a little bit of a transition.
Speaker 2: Definitely a transition, there were some people who were very instrumental in helping to develop me professionally.  And they were very honest with me and they told me what I needed to do in order to get to the next level.  And while I had all these assets, if I didn't develop these certain areas that I would never get to that next level.  So I listened, paid attention, did what I needed to do to get those other experiences behind me.  Made sure that I got the type of support I needed to learn instruction the way I needed to know instruction, I knew that was the core business teaching and learning.  I went out and learned from the best people that you could learn from, I learned from the best teachers who were teaching in our schools [Houston Independent School District] what it took to be.  I learned what it was to be a great teacher, I thought that was, it wasn't innate, I think for some people it is, for a lot of people you can develop those skills.
Speaker 1: What does it take to be a great teacher?
Speaker 2: I think it takes having what I'll call a variety of tools in a toolkit that you just don't come with; I think it takes someone who cares.  If you do not care for children, they'll know you're not real and they will not deliver for you.  If you care for them, they will do what you don't expect them to do.
Speaker 1: In order to be a good administrator in education, do you think that you; you have to be or have to have been a teacher?
Speaker 2: I don't think you can be successful leader of an urban district in America if you have not had those experiences along the way.  There are many things that I understand about this business that I understand because I, I experienced them first-hand.  But I also experienced taking systems that were not working very well and transitioning those systems to very effective and very functional systems for children.  If you haven't done that, you're always playing a guessing game; I don't guess about what I do, my decisions are very, very direct based on what I know that works for our children.  I understand how to take a school that's now functioning very well and go in and determine to why it's not functioning very well, and do what's necessary to turn that school around.  You can't just do that if you don't know what to look for when you get there.  It's, it's not always about changing the leadership, but it is about changing the chemistry of what people do when they walk in the schools.  'Cause schools are social institutions, and to change a social institution, you have to change human behavior.  Whether it's the adults or the children or the leadership, you have to be committed to influencing behavior.  And you cannot negotiate the fact that all of our children must be successful or given an opportunity to be successful.
Speaker 1: And do you ever tire, though, of having to you know turn things around of, do you think sometimes it would be nice to work in a school district where you didn't have to focus so much energy and time on turning things around?  Do you think that often times too much time is spent on turning things around and making things effective?
Speaker 2: I, I think that's a part of, a part of me, I like challenges.  I see challenges as opportunities.  I believe if I had a position where I did not have those opportunities, I probably would get bored very easily.  I, I love the challenge, it's the only jobs I'm gonna get anyway; I understand that as long as I stay in this business.  I think it's something that you accept in the beginning when you make the decision to take on these jobs.  You realize that I'm not gonna get the suburban district where you know the SAT scores are average of twelve hundred (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Lots of money (laughter).
Speaker 2: Lots of money.  Those are jobs that people of color don't get opportunities to take on from the beginning.  I think this job [CEO of Prince George's County Public Schools] was a good one, I think it's the right job for me.  All of the chemistry was right when I decided to accept this job.

Speaker 1: Let's back up just a little bit.  Let's talk about 1998, the Yonkers Public School[s] district.  What were your experiences in New York like?
Speaker 2: First headline, "First African American Superintendent to, first African American to take on the job of Superintendent of Schools for the Yonkers Public Schools."  Well you you're first in anything, and you're African American, you better understand there are some forces there that are not necessarily going to be receptive of who you are.  This board actually came and found me in Houston [Texas] at the time, I had been very successful in working in one of the sub-districts of Houston, was actually the lowest performing district, south central district.  And we were able to demonstrate that we could eliminate the achievement gap for minority children.  It was a 98 percent minority district, 93 percent free and reduced lunch, and we blew the top off of the state test.   And we basically wiped out the achievement gap, three years prior to my going down to that district; it was the lowest performing district in Houston.  And clearly this is something that I knew I could replicate in other places, so naturally Yonkers was involved in phase two of their deseg [desegregation] case; EIP II is what was called, Educational Improvement Plan II.  It's a court ordered plan that basically forced the State of New York, City of Yonkers [New York] to contribute millions of dollars in new money to this school system to basically turn around its student achievement with the primary goal in the court ordered plan to eliminate the achievement gap that was the number one goal of the plan.  When the board hired me, I had already reviewed the educational improvement plan, and I told them well the plan had good research base components.  It had a tremendous amount of flaws in it, the implementation was wrong.  And I told them if they would, if the courts would allow me to change the plan, I would take the job, if they would not allow me to change the plan, I would not take the job.  And the reason why is because I didn't believe you should waste some good money and not do what was necessary to improve achievement for minority children.
Speaker 1: Un-huh, so and obviously the courts allowed you to change the implementation.
Speaker 2: Through (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Component.
Speaker 2: A fight with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] sounds ironic doesn't it?  They were totally against what I was attempting to do.
Speaker 1: What were you attempting to do?
Speaker 2: I was attempting to restructure the implementation plan.  I, I'll make it simplistic. I, I'll call it the stair step approach to improving public schools.  You'd fix eight schools this year, eight schools the next year, eight schools the next year, eight schools the next year.  They truly believed they were gonna get a billion dollars in funding from the State of New York and the City of Yonkers to improve the school system.  I, I take the different approach, my approach was let's level the playing field, let's get everybody, give everyone what they need upfront and then we'll begin to manage the improvement as it occurs overtime.  And then we'll at least know, we'll have a solid basis of determining what we need to do to fix schools that are not moving in the right direction.  'Cause everyone will have the same materials and resources from year one to make those improvements.  We closed the school system for a week for professional development for our teachers, because of all the new programs we were putting in.  Because of all the new money that was going in, that was showing up in classrooms.  We wanted teachers to know how to use this stuff, so we provided forty hours of training, concentrated training during my first year.  This was only seven months on the job.
Story_ID: 260708
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Andre J.] Hornsby why was this plan, why was the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] at odds with your implementation approach?
Speaker 2: Because they had collaboratively developed this plan [Education Improvement Plan II (EIP II)] with the teachers union, with parents in the community and they felt that the plan that they had put together was the right plan.  Based on the money that was available for the window of time that they knew this plan would exist.  On the other hand, I, I believe something very different.  I believe that knowing that the City of Yonkers [New York] was against the school system in the lawsuit, we were in opposite ends.  I was in a dependent system, I depended on the city to give me revenue to run the school system; I was not independent.  I felt because the city was against that, and they were actually co-plaintiff with the state, against the school system.  That in fact that if for some reason they were able to stay the order that we would not get all that money.  And I was correct, the $35 million we received that first year, I put that money in the new reading, math technology programs, throughout all the schools in the system.  Trained our teachers up and implemented those programs with that new money.  At the end of that first year, we already begin to see the backsliding occur.  That summer the appeal, appellate court basically agreed with the state and the city and stayed the funding order, which meant we were not going to get all of that money that we were promised, that we would receive.  Because of the investments we had made in the first year, I was able to convince the mayor [John Spencer] to give us some additional funding out of the city's budget, city's coffers.  And we did a lot of, a lot of restructuring of our existing expenditures and our existing debt.  Which allowed us to continue to implement those programs beginning year to lowered class size, all day four year old programs.  All day five year old program, technology infused throughout the curriculum, pre-K [kindergarten] to twelve, new reading, new math programs, similar to what I'm doing now.  And I began to replicate the same experiences I had had in the prior school system.  Because I knew, I knew those methods work, it was no doubt in my mind that minority children could achieve beyond what anybody expect if I basically pushed the workforce to the wall.  If I pushed them to their, their highest limit or beyond what they felt they could believe.  My workforce was 88 percent white, my school district was 75 percent minority.  Fifty some percent Hispanic [Latino], twenty some percent African American.  High poverty, large free and reduced lunch population, very similar to what I left in Houston [Texas].  So the, the dy- dynamics, the basic make-up of the environment was very parallel to that which I had experienced before.
Story_ID: 260709
Speaker 1: From Yonkers [Public Schools] you went to the National Alliance of Black School Educators [NABSE].  How did that opportunity come about (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Actually, actually I've been in NABSE for nineteen years.  At that time I'd only been in the NABSE around fifteen years.  I'd always been an integral part of the organization.  I joined in the '80s [1980s], I became a life member right away, paid life membership, because I felt it was an organization I wanted to be a part of for the rest of my career.  When I left, when I left Yonkers [New York], and what I, and what I didn't say is we had the largest student achievement gain to New York State in less than a year and half of my tenure of being in Yonkers.  But because there was a, a falling out of the ways between the mayor [John Spencer] and myself, the racist behavior in Yonkers showed up, big time.  The mayor refused to give any money to the school district; he didn't care if we laid off the entire workforce.  And I just told him, I didn't come here to destroy what we had put in place.  I came here to build upon and our children had demonstrated it in fact that we had made the right decisions in the initial year.  And we were already seeing the benefits of, of that work for that he basically bought, they bought me out.  He had appointed the school board; he was able to finagle the vote after four months of pushing the board to buy me out.  He was able to finagle a five, four vote to buy me out a very contentious situation, very embattled situation.  Community was totally against it, even half of the board was totally against it, but he had a way of, he, he basically went after one of the board members whose wives worked for me.  And basically told that board member soon as we get him, then we're gonna come back and get your wife, shortly thereafter.  You know I understood what the man did; you know the man had to do what he had to do.  I told him I understood that and I moved on, I that summer I was always a member of NABSE but I had been elected to the position of president elect of NABSE which help me to continue to do what I felt I needed to do.  Not only as a leader of a school system, but also over a national organization.  If I could take that same belief system and begin to impart some of that information to my colleagues nationally, it would allow us to improve urban education for minority children.  Not just minority children but for all children.  During that summer, I became a consultant working with New York City [New York, New York], the board of education in New York City.  Harold [O.] Levy had just been appointed chancellor, Harold asked me to come on board after about six months of consulting.  I basically evaluated the forty-two superintendents that were working in New York City public school system, and Harold asked me if I would come aboard and be a member of his team.  And I agreed in January of 2001, I took a position as executive director for leadership development.  What was called the executive, wasn't really the executive director, it was the executive superintendent for leadership development in New York City's public school systems.  So basically I took over leadership development for administrators in the New York City public school system.  And worked directly with superintendents who worked in the lowest performing districts in New York City.
Story_ID: 260710
Speaker 1: Was it as gratifying to you or, or were you feeling like you know, you, you really wanted to go back to what you were doing before really working within an urban school district?  You know implementing change that kind of thing, or, or was this gratifying for you in another way?
Speaker 2: There are two dynamics, when you get bought out or fired as some people say as an African American leader; it's very hard for you to get another opportunity to lead again, even though that is the culture of superintendencies.
Speaker 1: Right, do you, do you really believe that even though that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No doubt about it, no doubt about it.  When I left Yonkers [Public Schools], they created all these fictitious investigations, the mayor [John Spencer] tried to justify why he fired me.  They created all these reports with this inspector general, all this bogus stuff that was based on conjecture to try and basically give himself the ability to re-elected.  And go on to be a county exec [county executive] and basically the tides turned on him, because of everything he tried to do to destroy my career.  I saw it as an opportunity for me to basically build myself up professionally again.  Personally thanked Harold [O. Levy] for taking a chance on me, based on everything that had been written in the papers.  And I mean they really went to destroy me personally and professionally.  And that tends to be typical of what happens to African American male leaders, once they get bought out or fired from superintendencies or asked to move on.  It's very tough to get the next job, because I had an opportunity to work in New York City [New York, New York], it gave me an opportunity to put myself back on the map professionally.  It's like being in recovery; it was good to not be the head.  But to be able to assist and support Harold in achieving some of the goals that we were able to achieve in a couple of years that I was there with him in New York City [at National Alliance of Black School Educators (NABSE)].  But yeah, the goal was always to get back into another superintendency.
Speaker 1: And you know it's interesting to me 'cause when I think about what I've learned about you and your life, it's kind of like here you are again with that hamstring injury.
Speaker 2: Yep.  Knocked down again (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Pulling through it you know and, and back on the winning team after you know some struggles, some pain, etcetera.  Do you ever look at it that way?
Speaker 2: I know how to get up; I think what we have to teach our children in schools today is how to get up.  You know they're not going to be all gonna be straight A students, you don't have to be, all you have to do is go to the next level.  Continue to persevere, get your union card, get the degree, it'll give you another opportunity in life.  I think we fail when we don't teach our children how to get up, 'cause they're gonna get knocked down, that's life.  You know there, there's no we, we don't get silver spoons, we don't get golden spoons you know we get the stainless steel stuff.  And we have to know how to get back up again, and I think if, if you're gonna teach any lesson in life to any of our children; it's that you always have another chance to get back up again.  Failure is not trying to get back up again.
Speaker 1: Did your grandmother [Vinita Delpit (ph.)] teach you how to get up?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: You think?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she told me that early on in life, she said they're gonna knock me down, they're gonna tell me what I can't be, they're gonna teach me that I'm inferior for certain reasons.  She said, "I always want you to remember one thing, you're my baby and you're the smartest thing that I've ever seen and you just continue to get back up again.  And life will, life will be good to you," she said, "but always remember there's gonna be a struggle, and always remember who you are and never give that up.  Never give it up."
Story_ID: 260711
Speaker 1: How did the opportunity in Prince George's County, Maryland come about?
Speaker 2: Through search firms.  When I left New York City [New York, New York], when the new administration came in, I didn't wanna be a part of the new administration in New York City after Harold [O. Levy] left, I began consulting again, and looking to see what was available.  Every spring there a number of jobs that come up throughout the country, and I began to interview for various jobs around the country.  I won't say what all of them were, because some of those interviews were confidential, where I could go in and interview and nobody would ever knew that I interviewed.  It didn't, it wasn't good to me to be second or third, I thought that was a waste of time.  Probably the one that was public was New Orleans [Louisiana] interviewed for the New Orleans Public School System; it's a job that wasn't meant for me it wasn't the right chemistry.  Things didn't work out, I actually knew when I went and interviewed who was gonna get the job.  The politics, the people I knew from my family, from the city had already given me the background on what the politics were, and what was gonna happen.  Everything they said to me fell right in place, but I demonstrated that there are qualified African American men in this country and women who can take on those jobs, and be very successful if given the opportunity.  At the same time, I was interviewing in New Orleans, I was interviewing in Texas I was interviewing in Ohio a number of states.  And then this position came up in Prince George's County, actually the executive director for NABSE [National Alliance for Black School Educators] who's from Baltimore City [Maryland], informed me that Prince George's County was looking for a superintendent.  I didn't know anything about Prince George's County, but I begin to do my research at that time, and I put in my application.
Speaker 1: So it didn't concern you at all just a lot of the, the battling that Iris [T.] Metts had to deal with the former CEO of schools or superintendent of schools?
Speaker 2: No, no, what you learn in these jobs is that if you're gonna do what's right for children, it's going to be a struggle.  If you take an organization with twenty-three thousand employees, full-time and part-time, and you try and change their cultural attitudes and behaviors toward our children, you're not gonna make a lot of friends.  It's going to be a definite struggle.  I did see the chemistry of the board change; I did research in the newspapers and looked at the difference in the articles.  That was important to me, because I do understand that you cannot move urban districts forward if you don't have a board that's committed to improving the quality of education for children.  And a lot of people could give lip service, there's a lot of people who demonstrate it and so part of the research you have to do when you take these jobs is, what is the political climate around schools?  What are the political challenges that you might face when you take these jobs?   The state had just adopted ninety-four, what 949 as a bill, house bill [HB 949, 2002] which basically eliminated the elected school board.  And they came up with an appointed board by the governor; the county exec [county executive] picked the board members based on their expertise.  Each one had to fit a certain category in order to be able to get a position on the board; I thought it to be very unique in the selection of a board.  They had been in place at least six months.
Speaker 1: Do you think it's a good idea to appoint board members appoint members, aport--opposed to electing them?
Speaker 2: I think you can have pitfalls in either arena, but what was significant to me was that each of these individuals were placed on this board because of a expertise that they brought.  When you have elected boards, there's no expertise required in most states, its age and residence, and not being a criminal, that's it, there's no expertise.  At least in this particular case, they were looking for individuals with background in education, in business or parents or community representatives being active in the communi--they had specific roles that they were designated you know to take on when they became members of this appointed board.  I saw that as very unique type of thing and I also saw that as an opportunity to really come in and make a difference for a school system with a large African American population.  That attracted me.  A hundred forty thousand students.  Over a hundred and six thousand of them African American, not performing at all academically, very low performance.  It was a system that was gonna get new money though.  The Bridge to Excellence Acts [Bridge to Excellence in Public Schools Act of 2002], the Thornton Act [Thornton Plan] had been approved. It guaranteed millions of dollars in new money over four to five years (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm sorr--
Story_ID: 260712
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Andre J.] Hornsby we were talking about your interest in the open- the vacancy in Prince George's County [Maryland].  What--I'm just curious about this--what did you think about that title of you know CEO, chief executive officer for the county public schools [Prince George's County Public Schools] opposed to superintendent, what did you think about that?
Speaker 2: Well to me it's very different position, when I was developing myself as an administrator, through a program I was involved in the Houston Independent School District, I actually had a CEO mentor.  So we worked directly with members of the business community, and people who were CEOs of major companies.  And it gave us a different perspective on understanding and beginning to focus on what your core business is versus sometimes one of those ancillary things that you're required to do.  So I look at school systems and leading school systems being very different sometimes maybe than my colleagues.  I was, far as I'm concerned, I run ten, twelve major businesses. They are all just as critical in order to make sure that schools are running effectively.  I run a construction company, I run a transportation company, I run a food service company, all of these major businesses a huge financial, huge construction company.  These are all integral part of what we do in order for teaching and learning to occur.  If any of those pieces are not run a--running effectively, they can in fact affect your product.  If you can't pick up children and get them to school, how are they gonna learn?  If you don't feed children when they're there when they come from high poverty, you know you can't learn on an empty stomach.  I mean there are some critical pieces that when you begin to dissect this business, a one point three point billion business, when you dissect it you understand how you're money works.  And where your money is beginning to work effectively and where your money is not working effectively.  And it's important to know what that is and be able to make those changes and adjustments to the organization so that you are delivering a better product.  A better environment for teaching and learning for our children to be effective, different perspective sometimes than some of my colleagues look at what we do.
Speaker 1: But do you think that it's the perspective that works best for you and what you do best?
Speaker 2: Well it's a combination, for example, this position based on the legislation [HB 949, 2002] require that I hire a chief academic officer, a chief accountability officer, a chief financial officer.  I've added some other positions, chief information officer, chief for human resources, chief for operation and maintenance so it was consistency in terms of leadership titles and commensurate with their responsibilities.  Which I could never get away from teaching and learning, see that's the core business.  If you look at the legislation, the legislation is basically saying as the chief executive officer, you will hire these other people and they will take ownership and responsibility for making sure these other things happen.  As far as I'm concerned, you can't be a chief executive officer of an educational institution if you don't know teaching and learning.  I mean there some things you cannot give away; this is the core business, so I cannot separate myself from the core business.  So I'm intimately involved in the decisions that are made by my chief accountability officer, my chief for strategic planning and my chief academic officer, I have to be involved in that.  You cannot separate yourself from that because that is the business.  When you separate yourself from that and you, you distance yourself from that, you're not able to know how to manage change in an organization this size.  Unless you understand what is being done, how it's being implemented, how the workforce is rec, whether the workforce is receptive or not to the changes that you're making.  And how to manage change, so you have to be a part of all of that as you run an organization this size.  And I think that's what chief executive officers do.  They run a lot of companies, they run a lot of businesses.  They're not necessarily running them day-to-day, but they're intimately involved in all of the decisions that are made as to whether each one of those operations are running effectively and efficiently.

Speaker 1: What do you think was your biggest challenge here in Prince George's County [Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Recovering an $82 million deficit in one year.  I knew there were financial problems.  I told the board that when they interviewed me, I said regardless of whether you hire me or not, you have some serious financial challenges that I was able to identify in looking at the various audits that have been conducted over a number of years.  And I said you have a problem that's compounding itself and I don't believe it's being addressed properly.  Naturally the board did believe it was being addressed.  After about three weeks on the job [chief executive officer of Prince George's County Public Schools], I told them we have an $82 million problem.  They thought we had anywhere from a one point five million to a twelve million dollar problem, that had already been resolved.  I told them no way, so it was convincing then and believe in the fact that I understood what I was saying to them.  We put a plan in place to recover that funding that would not be disruptive to this organization.  I was able to convince them to bring me in a month earlier than what they were going to bring me in.  Because I basically said to them, once the budget is established, you can't change it, it's hard to change the expenditure for an organization this size unless you do it before you finalize that budget.  And we were able to work very collaboratively, that was part of the chemistry that I saw from the board.  That was part of what I sense when I was interviewed by this board, I felt very good about the expertise that was around the table.  The questions that were asked, the body language was right, I thought this was the right job for me, I still do.  Still do.
Speaker 1: And what do you think has been your biggest accomplishment thus far?
Speaker 2: I think in the first eighteen months recovering the deficit, number one raising student achievement in the system.  In third grade, we raised reading scores by 18 percent; we raised math scores by 16 percent.  We raised scores overall in both math and reading and throughout the county and elementary and in high schools.  Eighty-three percent of our elementary schools improved their academic achievement last year, 94 percent of our middle schools, 75 percent of our high schools in less than the first full year on the job.  We had three basketball state champions; we had a girls track champion last year, this year.  Two football state champions, one girls cross country track champion, we have six National Merit Scholars, we're gonna have many more by the time I get I get finished.  The organization really had not been producing a lot of National Merit Scholars.  We tested every eighth grader and ninth graders last year on the PSAT [PSAT/NMSQT; Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholar's Qualifying Test] with our goal to moving them into an academic program to develop significant increase in the number of students taking AP [Advanced Placement] courses.  We have really put the rigor back into the curriculum here in my second year; it's going to be a high school curriculum that's second to none in the country.  I'd rather for a child to learn 50 percent of the most rigorous courses than to never have been involved in those courses.  I think it makes them a better individual later on in life; it'll also give them flexibility in the workforce.  It will give them opportunities to take jobs that would've not had an opportunity to take.  If we kept them in a watered down curriculum that tracked our children into courses that was not going to give them the experience they needed to go on to the next level.  That's some of what we've done in the first eighteen months.

Speaker 1: Prince George's County [Maryland], it neighbors Montgomery County, Maryland and somewhat Fairfax [County], Virginia which both have reputations for stellar school systems.  And some might say that Prince George's County's school system [Prince George's County Public Schools] reputation is a little less than stellar.  Were the any trepidations on your part about the reputation of the school system?
Speaker 2: No, that's why I took the job [chief executive officer], the reputation that I came in here understanding that existed has been painted by the media for a number of years.  I saw a, a group of people who were very capable of delivering a very good educational product.  That probably have been beat down by people saying you're second from the bottom. My philosophy is just the opposite.  You wanna be number one, you gotta start somewhere. It's easier to improve by a significant numbers in leaps and bounds when you have a long ways to go than what it is to stay at the top.  No Child Left Behind [Act of 2001] is significant in that, we look at children based on their disaggregated orientation, whether it's ethnicity, whether its gender.  Whether it's free and reduced lunch, whether it's whether you're an English language speaker or of another language, we look at all of those groups.  Whether you're on free or reduced lunch and we compare ourselves.  What the data showed me is that Prince George's minority children are not doing so bad when they're compared to these same populations in these other groups.  When you look at the minority population in Fairfax or in Montgomery County, our students are right up there with their students.  The differences are they have large others population, well I believe that we need to be about eliminating the achievement gap and not whether our minority children are competing at the same level as the minority children in Montgomery and Fairfax, No Child Left Behind will force that.
Speaker 1: So as an educator, do you support No Child Left Behind?
Speaker 2: Yes, I experienced it in [Houston] Texas, I worked in Texas twenty-three years, No Child Left Behind started in Texas.  What a lot of people don't realize is No Child Left Behind and the heart of soul of it was developed by Ron Edmonds a, a black professor from the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].  Who talked about the effect of school correlates in the '80s [1980s] he died at a young age.  The key component in whether you determine whether a school was effective or not, you had to look at its sub-populations.  If the sub-populations were not performing at the same level as the majority population, you didn't have an effective school, that's the heart and soul of No Child Left Behind.  Does it have flaws? Of course. Is it a perfect law? No, no laws are.  Can it be improved? Without a doubt. There is one thing that we cannot ignore, our children are not performing at levels they should be performing at.  And that is because of expectations or lack of expectations.  Well I have high expectations for our children, same expectations I have for my own children.  So that's why I believe I'm in the right job, I'm in the right place. Is it gonna be a battle? Of course.  Is the beast gonna rise up that I've seen rise up elsewhere, the racism? Of course it's gonna come out here, I'm gonna deal with that.  Am I'm gonna deal with jealously? No doubt about it. Am I gonna make a whole lot of friends? Probably not.  Are we gonna improve this school system? No doubt about it.
Story_ID: 260715
Speaker 1: And speaking of battles and you know some, 'cause there has been some controversy over recently an FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] investigation and that just you know what, what's your response to that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When you're a black male in America, I can remember back from the days of you asked me about Stokely Carmichael, you ask me about the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party], would do you know about them?  Intimately involved with the FBI, this is an allegation, I doubt very seriously the FBI is interested in [HistoryMaker] Andre [J.] Hornsby, I'm not a criminal, I love children, I love the school business.  I know how to use money effectively, I know how to work with staff and listen to their recommendations.  I'm intimately involved in the people who are in the educational industry that sell products to public educational institutions.  Because that's what you're supposed to do.  A CEO should not allow millions of dollars to be spent aimlessly and without having a specific purpose in mind knowing that those things will yield results for the children that you teach.  Yeah, I should be in that decision making matrix, yes I should be involved in it.  What it says is that people are not questioning whether I have the ability to do my job; they're trying to bring nonsense into the discussion to try to deter us from doing what I know we will be able to do. That's what's good about having a good school board.  They are clearly focused.  They understand why they're here.  They're holding me accountable.  They're holding my feet to the fire to make sure that we're expending the new dollars we have coming into the system to meet the needs of the children here in Prince George's County [Maryland].
Story_ID: 260716
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Andre J.] Hornsby when you look back at your life what stands out the most to you and why?
Speaker 2: I, I think what stands out the most is that I'm a very focused individual, I'm a very competitive person, it's hard for me to loosen up.  When I get with my family, I can relax all of this goes away, it's, it's very good to have those bonds and those relationships.  We grew up very young, very close we never separated from that; we always maintained those relationships throughout life.  We continue to do that; we continue to gather as a family, even though you know our mothers are much older now.  Many of our fathers are deceased, but we still find ways to get together at holidays or for me Mardi Gras, and do the things that are culturally important to help us understand.  And to give our children an opportunity to, to have those same relationships with their sibling--

Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?  What is it that you want people to say about [HistoryMaker] Andre [J.] Hornsby that will really represent who you are and, and what you've accomplished in your life?
Speaker 2: He understood the importance of education for all children; he was fully committed to eliminating substandard education for minority children.  He knew beyond the shadow of a doubt that our children are our future, and if we don't teach our children about their past, they're gonna make the same mistakes that continue to be made along the way.  We wanna make sure that our children understand they have a rich history, they have the ability to do whatever it is they chose to do, but they need to make good decisions.  And we must teach them how to make good decisions.  If there's nothing else we do as educators, we must teach our children to be able to struggle, to be able to get up when they've been knocked down, but make good decisions in life.

Speaker 1: And is there anything else you'd like to add [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Andre J.] Hornsby that perhaps we didn't touch on?
Speaker 2: I thank all of the people in my life who have made contributions to help me to get to where I am today.  I hope that I am at least living up to the things that they believed that I had within me to offer.  I think I made my grandmother [Vinita Delpit (ph.)] happy and my mother [Leatrice Delpit Hornsby] every step of the way.  I'm not a perfect person, nobody is, but I think I know how to do what I'm doing and I'm very committed to completing those tasks as long as I'm actively involved in education.
