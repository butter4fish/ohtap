Speaker 1: I just want to thank you again for coming today.  And we're gonna slate the tape to let everybody know who's here and who is (unclear).  I'll start with myself.  I'm Adele Hodge, and I'm the interviewer for today, which is February 24, year, 2003.  And my camera person is Scott Stearns, a staff camera person here at the HistoryMakers.  We have a guest observer in this interview, Mrs. Betty Ann Gardner.  And we are talking with Jolyn Robichaux, who will give us her full name and nicknames, and spell them, and the names, and spell them, of her mother and father and where they're from.
Speaker 2: All right, well, my name is Jolyn, J-O-L-Y-N.  My middle initial is Howard, which is also my birth name.  And my married name is Robichaux, R-O-B, as in boy,-I-C-H-A-U-X, as in x-ray.  I have to use all those because I get V's and all kinds of things mixed in there if I don't spell it that way.  My mother's name was Margaret Love.  My father's name was Edward Howard.  And did you ask my birth date?  (Laughter)
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That's what gonna be next.  Where and when were you born?
Speaker 2: Well, where is Cairo, Illinois, C-A-I-R-O.  And it's that place in Illinois that comes down to a tip, that's Cairo, right at the very--right on the Mason Dixon Line.  I was born there on May 21st, 1928.  So that means in a couple of months, I'll be seventy-five years old.
Speaker 1: And your mom and dad, their birthdates, birth place.
Speaker 2: Well, my father [Edward Howard] was born in 1898 in a little town called Mounds, Illinois, which is nine miles north of Cairo.  My mother [Margaret Love Howard] was born in 1910 in Macon, Illinois, which is central Illinois.
Speaker 1: Oh, so you're a true Illinoisan.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm true Illinois--
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION):
Speaker 2: And our location, would you give us our location?
Speaker 1: Oh, we're at 1900 South Michigan in Chicago, Illinois, on the third floor, which I had to (laughter) travel all those stairs.  So I got here slowly.
Story_ID: 19504
Speaker 1: Now, our People Magazine questions, the fun things.  What is your favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color is all shades of purple, lavenders, all the way to the deep purples.
Speaker 1: And your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food is food (laughter), I love food.  The only thing I can't, I don't eat are oysters.  But if you get--put a whole lot of oys--horseradish on it and hot sauce, I can get them down, but otherwise.  But I love steaks.  And that--I don't know what that means.  I don't even know what, what colors mean.  But I know I like to wear purple, and I think pur--I think purple looks good on me.
Speaker 1: And tell me your favorite vacation destination.
Speaker 2: Europe, any place in Europe.
Story_ID: 19505
Speaker 1: Okay, travel with me, if you will, back to your grandparents' day.  You are a dyed in the wool Illinoisan.  Were your grandparents from--
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Did you do phrase or saying?
Speaker 1: No, I didn't.
Speaker 2: Yes, my paternal grandparents are from, from Mounds, Illinois.  Now, my grandfather [John Howard] was born a slave.  And I really don't know how he got to Illinois.  But again, you have to remember that Cairo, Illinois is right on the Mason Dixon Line.  So it could have been that he--after the, after the Civil War [1861-1865], his folks just traveled a few miles above, and settled in Mounds.  I don't know anything about my paternal grandmother [Augusta], except the people told me she was a very sweet, kind person.  And his personality was the exact opposite.  He was harsh and, a harsh man.  And so she balanced it off.  And my, my--but they educated all their children.  My, my, my father's sister was a school teacher in Detroit [Michigan].  And, of course, my father [Edward Howard] was a dentist.  And so that gave my grandfather a lot of pride, I think, that he was born a slave, and his, his children were well educated.  My maternal grandparents lived in Shelbyville, Illinois.  And they were transplanted from Kentucky.  The, my great, great grandparents were--on my, on my mother's side, were sent here from, from the plantation in Kentucky--well, two plantations.  And both of them were the, the children of the masters.  The, the girl was the daughter of the master, and the, the father--the grandfather was the son of the mistress of the, of the plantation.  And, and before the Civil War, they were married, and my aunt used to tell me, you--"And they were married in the, in the--by a minister."  And when I, when she used to tell me that, and I said, "I don't understand what you mean, you know, all people are married by ministers."  And that was quite unusual before the Civil War for a couple to be married by the ministers.  But both of these children were very well loved by their masters.  And then they sent them to Shelbyville, Illinois before the Civil War.  And that's--he became a barber.  His son became a barber.  His son's son became a barber.  And they lived a very, very nice life in Shelbyville.
Speaker 1: That's a, I mean wonderful that they had understanding and humane masters who--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah--very, very liberal.
Speaker 1: And got them all to the North just before it actually (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --And matter of fact, we, we still have some of their furniture.  I have two of the dining room chairs.  There were six dining room chairs.  And my sister [Charlotte Logan] has two, and my other sister [Marsha Braddix] has two.  So, and we have some of the silverware.
Story_ID: 19506
Speaker 1: One question I should have asked you earlier with our 'People [Magazine]' questions was "What is your favorite phrase or saying?"
Speaker 2: "It matters not how straight the gate, how charged with punishments the scroll.  I am the master of my fate.  I am the captain of my soul."  That's from [poem] "Invictus" [by William Ernest Henley.]  (Laughter)  It's the last stanza.  That's what I live by.  And Dorothy Parker has another one that I liked.  And I never will forget, I read it in a book at my grandmother's [Charlotte Love] when I was about twelve years old.  And that has done a lot to shape my, my life.  And it goes like this, "It matters--in youth it was a way I had to try my best to please, to change with every passing lad, to suit his theories.  But now, I know the things I know and I do the things I do, and if you do not like me so, to hell, my love, with you."  (Laughter)  That's Dorothy Parker.  She--wasn't she clever. And here I was twelve or thirteen years old telling all the boys, you know--it worked so.  If you let them know where you are, things will happen.
Story_ID: 19507
Speaker 1: What kind of relationship did you have with your father [Edward Howard]?
Speaker 2: I loved, I adored my father, adored him.  He, he was fun loving, very interested in life.  We used to--he had a subscription to National Geographic magazine, and I can remember sitting on his lap and we would look through National Geographic (laughter), and that's the way I learned that there were other places in the world.  And he would tell me about these places.  They were--he, he'd never been to any of them either, but he, he, he taught me that there were, there was life other than this little, small--see, Cairo [Illinois] had a, then had a population of 14,000, and that there were things outside of, of Cairo.  So, but I, I adored him.  If you--see, he was a dentist in Cairo, Illinois at a time when, when it was extremely prejudiced.  We would have to get off the sidewalk if two people, white people came the opposite way.  We'd have to jump over on the side so that they could take the other sidewalk.  We couldn't walk around the, the four blocks that surrounded the, the library.  People, black people were not allowed to, to walk on those streets.  And yet, here's a dentist, had, well about sixty percent of his practice were white people, which was very unusual for a white person to go to a, to a black doctor.
Speaker 1: Where did he get his training?
Speaker 2: At Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee], Meharry, but he--all of these people went to him, which, which, which says another thing about human nature.  If, if they have to suffer, they don't care where they have to go to get relief.  So the word was out that if you went to Dr. Howard, you could have your teeth pulled, and he--you wouldn't even know it.  You wouldn't even feel it.  And what he did, he used magic.  He, he, he learned how to, to pull rabbits out of the hat and he was an amateur magician.  So he would, he would get these people in the chair and start talking to them and showing them his little tricks.  And then he'd grab a scarf and he'd grab his tools, and he'd go into the mouth and pull the tooth out, and they didn't even know it was gone (laughter).  So, he was, he was a showman.  And maybe that's where I got (laughter) it myself.  Yeah, yeah, so, so he was a very successful black doctor with white patients during the Depression.
Story_ID: 19508
Speaker 1: And there was only two--you and your sister.
Speaker 2: No, I had a brother who was twelve years younger than, than I, who passed away about ten years ago.
Speaker 1: And what was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was William.
Speaker 1: And your sister's name?
Speaker 2: Charlotte, Charlotte Logan.  She still lives here in Chicago [Illinois].  And then I have another sister, a half sister on my mother's [Margaret Love Howard] side.  She married after my father [Edward Howard] died.  And her name is Marsha Braddix.  She lives here in Chicago.
Story_ID: 19509
Speaker 1: What was it like growing up in the Howard household?
Speaker 2: Well, it was fun.  Every Sunday, we went to church.  My father [Edward Howard] didn't go to church, but my mother [Margaret Love Howard] took us to church, the Catholic church.  And then we came back home, and she would prepare a, a picnic and we would go out--this was in the summertime, and we would go out someplace and have this picnic under the stars, just my mother and father and the two kids.  See, my sister [Charlotte Logan] and I are just a year and a half difference in our ages.  And the, the boy [William Howard] didn't come until we were twelve or thirteen years old.  So, so he spent a lot of time with us.  And my mother was a good cook, and we didn't know that we were disadvantaged.  Everything was just happy and, and peaceful.
Story_ID: 19510
Speaker 1: School, when you entered school, what was that experience like?
Speaker 2: Well, we, we were both, my sister [Charlotte Logan] and I, put in a Catholic grammar school [St. Columba, Cairo, Illinois].  And it was the only Catholic school for, for, for black kids in the city.  And then when we went to high school, we were put in public school [Sumner High School, Cairo, Illinois].  And that was a good experience.
Speaker 1: And your favorite teacher in elementary?
Speaker 2: Sister Alfonzo, Sister Alfonzo.  She, she, she was wonderful.  Sisters of the Holy Cross.  And--
Speaker 1: Why was she your favorite?
Speaker 2: Why was she my favorite?  Why was she my favorite?  I, I think it's because she was so creative.  I always thought it was amazing that one teacher could teach four grades in one room, because the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grade were all in one room.  And it was, it was differentiated by the row.  So this, each row was a grade.  And, and she could teach all of those heads and all those grades in one, in one room.  And I think that's why I did pretty good in school because I would--when, in the fifth grade, I could finish my work real quick and then listen to her teach the six grade, then listen to her teach the seventh, so (laughter).  So, so, but I thought she was very--and, and she was a good teacher, astute woman.
Speaker 1: She never had to crack your knuckles?
Speaker 2: I, I didn't say that now (laughter).  She, I had a lot of whippings.  I was a, kind of a rebel, and I was always doing something wrong.
Speaker 1: Give me an example.
Speaker 2: Well, I, I--in grammar school, I would just talk a lot.  But in high school, I used to do crazy things like come back home, and get my father's car, and drive back to school.  And take all the kids and go to Mounds [Illinois].  And I used to do crazy things.
Story_ID: 19511
Speaker 1: How old were you when you started driving?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I graduated from high school [Sumner High School, Cairo, Illinois] when I was sixteen.  So, I was driving around thirteen, fourteen years old.  But nobody knew I had the car, you see (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk about your high school years.  Who was your favorite in high school?
Speaker 2: There was a lady named, my English teacher, Mrs. Malone.  And she was a--had a large bust, and she'd sit there, and I used to wonder, you know, how, you know, her breast would hang--would rest on the desk, you know.  But she, she taught me, she taught me about literature, you know, that there were books that had things in them that I didn't know about and that if I read enough of them, that I'd be a little more knowledgeable about the world.  I liked her.
Speaker 1: And when you--in your high school years, were you a social, what kind of student were you (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: I was a, I was a very good student academically, and I was the leader in my class, and the president and all that kind of stuff.  And, and I, I was very active in, in things.  Matter of fact, in, in southern Illinois, they had a contest among all of the high schools in that area.  And I would give readings, not readings--what did they call them back then?  Monologues. And I won my sophomore, junior and senior year.  So I couldn't sing (laughter), couldn't sing, couldn't, couldn't--I did play the piano.  But I, in, in my high school years, it was rather difficult because my father, whom I loved very much was ill.
Story_ID: 19512
Speaker 1: And I had sneaked a peak at a letter, a drawer that I wasn't supposed to look in, which was from a hospital in St. Louis [Missouri] that told, said that my father's [Edward Howard] illness was terminal and that he was gonna die in April--in the spring of 1945.  And I read this in 19--like maybe '42 [1942] or '43 [1943].  So, I always had the knowledge that my father was gonna die.  And sure enough, he died in May 1945.  He had a, a blood disease.  And he was very, very sick.  But he, he still worked up, right up until the last--well, about two months before, he got so sick that he had to be sent to a hospital in, in St. Louis.  And I say he had to be sent to the hospital because the hospitals in Cairo [Illinois] did not accept our people.
Speaker 2: How was it for you dealing with that information for that length of time?
Speaker 1: It was difficult.  I mean because I couldn't tell my mother [Margaret Love Howard] I knew because I'd, I wasn't supposed to have ever read that letter.  I couldn't tell my father that I knew 'cause that was, been too much.  But I knew, and it was not--but maybe it intensified the love I had for my father.  And I said, "Well, you know, you know, we just have X number of months to be together."  So, maybe my love was more intense, so maybe that was a good thing in a way.
Speaker 2: And you never told your sister [Charlotte Logan]?
Speaker 1: (nods head no)
Speaker 2: Well, that's quite a burden for a young person.
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: And how would you say that affected you?
Speaker 1: Well, look at me now.  I'm seventy-five years old with tears in my eyes.
Story_ID: 19513
Speaker 1: Your mother [Margaret Love Howard]?
Speaker 2: My mother was a, had been--as I said, my, my father [Edward Howard] was a dentist.  And I had a cousin who was a dentist.  They were in school together.  And he--my cousin took my mother, when she was a senior in high school--maybe she wasn't a senior, maybe she might have been a junior, to a party.  And my father saw her.  And he said, he told me this a lot of times, he said, "Your mother walked in that room, and she was so beautiful.  And I told several people then, said, 'This is the woman I'm going to marry.'"  But you had to think, it's--this is a little high school girl.  She lived in the town with 800 people [Macon, Illinois].  And, and she was naïve, and she was always very quiet, very, very cool and reserved.  I don't remember my mother holding me and kissing me.  But I know she loved me.  But she was just a very sweet, good woman, but not demonstrative.  My father took care of that (laughter), yeah, yeah.  And she was a good woman.
Speaker 1: And did you mother come from a large family?
Speaker 2: No, she was a single, an only child.  Matter of fact, my, my grandmother [Charlotte Love] and my grandfather [William Love] on my maternal side, lived in Macon [Illinois].  And my mother graduated from high school, and a couple of days later they had the wedding.  And they had the reception out on the lawn, of the front lawn, and the people came from all over, you know, that, to the wedding.  And my mother went in the house after a while and put on her traveling clothes because they were gonna drive from Macon to, to Cairo [Illinois].  And while they were dressed, all ready to leave, you know, saying good-bye to everybody, my grandmother came out and, with a change of clothes and a suitcase.  And she jumped in the back seat of the car.  So her husband was named William Love, and he said, "Lottie, where are you going?"  And Lottie said, "Will, I been telling you for years that when Margaret got married, I was gonna leave you.  Margaret got married, and I'm leaving" (laughter).  She did.  She jumped in that car.  And Daddy told me, said, "I didn't know what to do.  I didn't know whether I was supposed to pull her out or what.  And so she refused to get out with her little suitcase, and we drove her to a little town down the way, and she got a bus and, and, and--I didn't know at the time, but she went to Terre Haute, Indiana."  And she left my grandfather.  And so, so, so my sister [Charlotte Logan] tells me that the reason I jump up and do things sometimes is because that's my grandmother's blood, cause she (laughter)--grandmother was something.  And she never went back.  And--
Speaker 1: Very true to her words.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she said, "I been telling you that I'm gonna leave you when Margaret gets married.  Margaret got married, and I'm gone" (laughter).
Story_ID: 19514
Speaker 1: Socially, what was it like in high school?
Speaker 2: Well, of course, there was no mixture of races, so we were all like a little, big family.  And there was an area of town [Cairo, Illinois] called Future City.  And the town was built up on--all the houses were built on stilts because it regularly flooded.  So those, that was one class of people.  And other people who lived in town were the other class, but we were all black.  And, the school system itself was very poor.  My biology, teach--was taught--biology was taught by the coach of the basketball team.  And he didn't know anything about biology, so we learned how to play bridge (laughter).  So, and we had a library, but nobody ever went in the library.  We weren't even told to go in the library.  So when I went to college, I didn't even know what a card catalogue was.  So, but I graduated with, was valedictorian of my class.  But that didn't say that much (laughter) to be valedictorian of (laughter) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Now, the prom and that, that side of the social, just like in your high school years, what was that like?
Speaker 2: Well, I went to my junior prom, but I, I did something wrong, and they wouldn't allow me to go to the senior prom.
Story_ID: 19515
Speaker 1: But would you name your schools for me, elementary school (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: Well, the little elementary school was called St. Columba [Cairo, Illinois], C-O-L-U-M-B-A.  St. Columba was, was the man that took Jesus Christ over a road, a stream, and sort of symbolized helping people.  That was St. Columba.  That's the Catholic.  Grades were first through eighth.  And high school was Sumner [Cairo], S-U-M-N-E-R.  And he's from, was a very influential white person who was in education.  But neither one of those schools exist now because of the integration of the school system in Cairo.
Story_ID: 19516
Speaker 1: Your college years, when you got ready to go to college, what was going on in your mind at that time?
Speaker 2: Well, it, it was programmed, you know, as to where I was gonna go.  I was gonna go to Fisk [University] in Nashville [Tennessee] because my father [Edward Howard] went to Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee], and he wanted me to go to Fisk.  And it--did you ask me how, how--?
Speaker 1: What was, what kind of things were happening with you--you know, it's like you're embarking on the first part of your truly adult life.  What kind of things was Jolyn thinking about?
Speaker 2: Well, what kind of things was I thinking about?  I was just, you know, it was a goal to go to college.  And I, my father had just died, he died two days before I graduated from high school.  So because he knew he was going to die, he had taken my mother [Margaret Love Howard] to, to Decatur, Illinois to buy a house there so that when, when he died, you know, she--he knew that she was well cared for.  So, and Decatur was close to her father [William Love] and her mother [Charlotte Love], you know, see.  And so, so I, I had been involved with the move and went to the school, and went by myself.  Mother didn't take me there.  And it was just a wonderful experience to, to be in Jubilee Hall at Fisk University.  And, but I had a little guilt feeling because I felt that it was so expensive, so I thought, for my mother to be sending me to college, and, you know, after my father died.  But I, I took advantage of everything and had a lot of fun.  And--
Speaker 1: This was so close to you--to your father's death, and, you know, sometimes college can be, going away to college is a, kind of emotional too.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I was just wondering how you bridged that gap?
Speaker 2: Well, I had an experience one night about, oh, maybe it was about four or five months after I got into high school [sic. college].  And I was reading a book, they were talking about the king.  And I always thought of my father as the king of the, of the whole race as far as I was concerned.  And it was at that point that I realized he was dead.  And I cried and cried and cried.  It was uncontrollable for all the next day.  And then after I got through with that, the--the mourning and realized the, the reality of his death, that he was gone, everything was okay.  So, so from the time he was dead until then, I was sort of, looking like a dream world, even, even though we had moved, you know.  It's, it's really strange how people can isolate themselves from reality.  And I never will forget that experience reading that book, and all of a sudden, "Ah, my father is dead."  But I, I wanted to study, I wanted to study religions, didn't have any--I didn't, I, I just, I always thought it was interesting how there could be so many different religions 'cause in the Catholic schools, they taught you back then that that was the only religion, that was the only thing that was right, was to be a Catholic.  And that didn't set well with me.  I didn't understand how one thing could be the right thing.  And I wanted to study religions, but I never did.  I didn't--and I only went to Fisk for two years because after my sophomore year, I just felt that it was just too much of a grind on my mother.  And I decided to, to stop and get out of school.  And my mother never insisted that I stay in school.  So that's when, in 1947, I moved to Chicago [Illinois], and--to take the burden off of her.  And maybe, maybe four or five years ago, in going through some papers, I came across the, the bill for college.  Do you know that room and board and tuition at Fisk was $432 for a semester.  So that we're talking about $864 a year for room, board and tuition.  And of course four hundred--I'm not even sure I knew then how much it was.  But I mean my father had set aside quite a bit of money, I'm sure.  And, but I didn't know that.  But anyway, that was a good thing too.  I got out in the world.
Speaker 1: So you left, you were--your focus in college was a liberal arts curriculum?
Speaker 2: (nods head yes)
Story_ID: 19517
Speaker 1: So when you moved to Chicago [Illinois] because you were trying not to be a burden on your mother [Margaret Love Howard], in your mind, now, the big city.  Coming to big city, what was that like?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I--in high school, I was very good in shorthand and typing.  So I looked for a job as, as a stenographer.  And I found a job with Sears Roebuck [department store].  And I did what they called stenotype.  And I, I listened to these tubes of, and typed letters that had been dictated thereon.  And then I got a job with the--because I was so good, I mean I was good.  I, with shorthand and typing, I got a job with the Veterans Administration.  And they had a department head who wanted a very good stenographer.  And they appointed me his secretary.  That was another first in the [U.S.] Veterans Administration back in 194--'47 [1947], '48 [1948].  So I was secretary to this department head.  And that gave me a lot of status and a lot of enjoyment.  And I used my skills very well.
Speaker 1: Because the Sears job, that was a first too, wasn't it, back in those days?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah--yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: So, and this was a skill I learned in high school, you see.  I mean I didn't go to a special school to learn it.  But--so I will say that, that high school [Sumner High School, CAiro, Illinois] really gave me a very good base in business.
Speaker 1: So, you were probably, what, about twenty when you moved to Chicago?
Speaker 2: Yeah, twenty, yeah--well, I was about nineteen when I moved to Chicago, and I was about twenty when I went--took the secretarial job.
Speaker 1: I understand which was an extremely successful career because what you did then was equal to being a young entry-level (unclear) or something now.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I learned so much, you know.  I, I--because by being head, secretary of the head, I understood, you know, I had to take meetings, minutes of meetings and things like that.  And I, I learned, you know, how business worked.
Speaker 1: How long did you stay in that job?
Speaker 2: I can't remember.  I can't remember, maybe two, maybe three years.  And then I went to National Labor Relations Board.  And I became a court reporter there 'cause I, I took shorthand so well, as, as well as a secretary.  So I learned a lot about labor law because I would have to take dictation on, on their findings and, and investigations, you know, on strikes and things like that.  So that was, that was very good background.  I, I couldn't have gotten that if I'd been in college.
Speaker 1: Plus, it served you so well much later with, you know, when you became a business woman.
Story_ID: 19518
Speaker 1: And I did finish college at, at a later point, but--
Speaker 2: When did you go back to college?
Speaker 1: After my daughter [Sheila Glaze] was born.  I was married.
Speaker 2: Where did you go?
Speaker 1: Chicago Teachers [Chicago State Teacher's College, Chicago, Illinois], and--
Speaker 2: Did you teach?
Speaker 1: Not really, I, I practiced, did practice teaching.  And I was, you know, I graduated magna cum laude and, but I never taught.
Speaker 2: Isn't that Chicago State, was the Chicago Teacher's?
Speaker 1: Well, back then it was Chicago State Teacher's College, I think it was.  And then it turned into the Chicago State University.  And--
Story_ID: 19519
Speaker 1: Now, the period when you were working for the VA [U.S. Veterans Administration] and you're doing, recalling your stenographic years, that was a very dynamic, post-War period [ref to World War II].  What was life like for you away from work?
Speaker 2: Well, fun.  I mean I had a lot of friends and went to a lot of parties and fell in love for the first time.
Speaker 1: Tell me how that came about--?
Speaker 2: Oh, God (laughter).
Speaker 1: --how you met (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: On a blind date, on a blind date, I met this man.  And he had been in the Navy, and while he was in the Navy, his wife had died with childbirth.  And, and his wife had died about the same time my father [Edward Howard] had died.  And then we met.  And I never will forget, we sat out on the, Washington Park and somebody had a record player out there, and they said, they played 'Cottage for Sale,' and both of us sat up there and just bawled, just cried (imitating crying).  And he was crying for his wife, I was crying for my father.  And we developed a bond.  So, first, first love.
Speaker 1: And at what point did you meet and marry Mr. [Joseph J.] Robichaux?
Speaker 2: Let's see, it was while I was at the National Labor Relations Board.  And so we were married in '52 [1952].  So maybe that was '50 [1950] that I met him.  He, he had met my sister [Charlotte Logan] and asked if, were there any more like her at home?  And she said, "Yeah, I got a sister."  And he said, "Well, I'd like to meet her."  And I told her, my sister, I said I wasn't interested because I was engaged to another guy, to a man.  And he was in college in, in another city.  I forget it now.  And so she told him that I was gonna be at a certain affair at the Beige Room.  And he came, and, and acted a fool, trying to get my attention (laughter).  And he asked me to dance, and told me then that he was gonna marry me.  And he said, "I'll, I'll marry you."  I said, "But I engaged--am an engaged woman."  He said, "I'm gonna marry you."  And, well, he did.
Speaker 1: Well, now, I've got to ask you, how did this come about (laughter)?
Speaker 2: That's it.  I don't know.  I mean he, he had researched, evidently, me.  And he decided he was going to marry me.  And he--he also said he was gonna make me a championship golfer 'cause I, I had, I had learned how to play golf.  And he did, he did that too.  He just--the boyfriend, my fiancé, we fell out at some point.  And he was there, you know, bringing me all kind of gifts and everything and letting me drive his convertible, you know, (laughter).  He thoroughly impressed me.  And he was a good man.  He was a real good man.
Speaker 1: Was he from New Orleans [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: His folks were from New Orleans.  He had always lived in Chicago [Illinois].  And he, at the time, he was the director of Shield House, which was a part of the Catholic Youth Organization, a community house on 41st and Michigan.  And, and he was athletic director for St. Elizabeth's High School.  So, and quite a bit--well, considering what--I forget now, how old I was, something like twenty-two or twenty-three, twenty-four, something like that.  And he was twelve, twelve years older than I.  And, but there was a tradition in my family that all the women married men who were twelve years older than they.  And, and they also have asked them to marry them on the first time they saw each other.  Yeah, my, my grandmother [Charlotte Love] said that that's what had happened to her.  My mother [Margaret Love Howard] said that's what happened with my father.  It happened to me, and it happened to my daughter [Sheila Glaze].  Oh, every, (unclear).
Story_ID: 19520
Speaker 1: So, now, you are twenty-two, twenty-three, you're married.  You're starting a family.  What was that period like?
Speaker 2: Well, we didn't start a family until I was married for five years.  We had agreed on that.  And then my daughter [Sheila Glaze] came.  And I was thrilled.  And I wanted another baby right away because my sister [Charlotte Logan] and I were very close, and I thought I would have my two children or three children right together.  And, and my daughter looked just like my husband [Joseph J. Robichaux].  And I say that because I--the [U.S.] State Department and the Amateur Athletic Unit had sent me to Africa.  And I, and, and I was gone for six to eight weeks.  And when I came back, I was showing, I was pregnant, quite obviously.  And everybody in town was counting on their fingers (laugher).  And that baby came looking just like my husband.  And I was happy about that (laughter).  Not that I, not that I had any problem with it, but, you know, as far as the talk around town.  And so we, we had a very good marriage.  My husband and I did not argue much.  And the things we argued about were terribly inconsequential.  But I deferred to him on all things outside of the house, but I was the queen of the house, and he understood that.  So there were no problems.
Story_ID: 19521
Speaker 1: So at the time that you were ready--well, this is a little fast forward, I guess, to purchase Baldwin Ice Cream, tell me about the period leading up to the time and then when you actually decided and purchased Baldwin Ice Cream?
Speaker 2: Well, now, my son [Joseph Robichaux] came eight years after my daughter [Sheila Glaze].  And he was about five, five years old.  And we had a, as I said, we had a wonderful relationship, but my husband [Joseph J. Robichaux], by that time was, had--was doing, was doing things in politics.  And he had a track team that had girls on the Olympics every year.  And he also was vice president of a dairy here in Chicago [Illinois] called Wanzer.  And, and Kit, Kit Baldwin had passed several years previous.  And this, the, the major stockholder was not the Baldwin family, but the Baldwin family's lawyer, who was Archibald Cary, who was a very prominent lawyer, minister, UN [United Nations] delegate, very prominent, very fine person.  And he--Archibald Cary had a stroke.  And his doctor told him to divest himself of everything that he was involved in, you know, to play the, you know, to go in semi-retirement on the church and the legal and everything.  And then he was also involved in the operation of Baldwin.  And so he wanted to sell it, his shares.  And because my husband was involved with the Wanzer Dairy, Archibald Cary thought in terms of the progression of the company in, in black ownership.  And the reason I admire him that he thought that way, was that this company was started in 1921 by seven black postal employees who were underemployed in the post office because all of them had college degrees.  And it started out as Seven Links, then went to Seven Links in which Kit Baldwin had gotten, and then they had changed the name Baldwin Ice Cream.  So, Archibald Cary wanted the company to continue in, in black ownership, as well as he wanted an understanding that who, whomever he sold it to would take care of Kit Baldwin's widow.  So that was the arrangement.  We would buy the company, take care of, of Kit Baldwin's wife, and own the major shares of the Baldwin Ice Cream Company.  And my husband asked me if, if I was in agreement with that.  And I said yes.  And he said, "You're not doing anything at home 'cause you just got two children, and you're just--you don't have that much to do.  So I want you to come down to, to Baldwin every day and just see, you know, what the operation is like."  And I had, you know, I had to look at him a little askance, "What do you mean I don't have anything to do?  You know, I've got a teenaged daughter and a five-year old son, and a, a house to take care of."  But he didn't, up to this point, he didn't want me to work.  So I was, I was a, a housewife.  And so that's what happened.  We, I would--we, we bought the company for $25,000.
Speaker 1: Twenty-five?
Speaker 2: --And that included the building, the trucks and the ice cream parlors.  We had three ice cream parlors then.  And--
Speaker 1: Wasn't that a--that was a good deal even back then.
Speaker 2: Very, very good deal.  Very good deal.
Story_ID: 19522
Speaker 1: Did you have a kind of hard time putting together the package to buy it?
Speaker 2: No, no.  No, he got a loan to a bank in Evanston [Illinois].  That's another story (laughter).
Speaker 1: He had to go to Evanston to get, to finance the purchase?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Why was that?
Speaker 2: I, I don't know.  I didn't--I wasn't involved in that part of it.  My husband [Joseph J. Robichaux] took care of it, but that's where, that's where the loan came from, to buy it.  And so, but the, but the business was in receivership.  And (unclear) the money that came in, then had to be allocated to one of his--one of the Baldwin, what do you have, debtor or creditor, you know.  And so the Baldwin [Ice Cream]--so the company actually lived off of the, the, the route--not the route, I mean the retail store sales.  And they had these trucks, but everything went to, to the creditors.  So I didn't take, I had a, I, I took a--first, for the first two or three years, it was fifty dollars a week.  Then I, I got a raise to a hundred dollars a week.  My husband never took any salary until--well, that's another story.  He, he never took a salary.  And then, and then we paid--on payday, we would give a check to Mrs. Baldwin, of course.  And so that's the way it--and it thought of itself as a retail operation with a few trucks.  And the reason for that is that it had always been retail from 1921 on.
Story_ID: 19523
Speaker 1: And in the early--let's see, in the late 1940's, right after the War [World War II, 1939-1945], I don't know, you were too young.  You can't remember the gas ration stamps.  So the people would have to use their gas ration stamps to come to Baldwin [Ice Cream] on the weekends to get their ice cream, you see.  And they started telling Kit Baldwin, you know, why should we have to come all the way down here, and use all of our gas stamps to get ice cream, and there's a Jewel and there's a Kroger, and blah, blah, blah store near us.  And we, we--but we don't want that ice cream.  We want Baldwin.  Why can't you get Baldwin Ice Cream in their stores?  Well, it was unheard of to have a black product in a white chain store.  So Kit Baldwin, being the good businessman that he was, says, "Well, you know, it wouldn't help if I walked in there and said, you know, 'I want to go in.'  Why don't you, as a customer, go in?"  And they talked to their ministers about this.  And there was another store, company, a black-owned company called Parker House Sausage.  So they were, they were complaining about Parker House Sausage, you know, too, you know,"Why should we have to come all the way down to get Parker House Sausage?"  So--and this was not well organized.  But it was just a casual concentration of focus for the churches.  You know, if, if you want to save your, your gas station--gas, gas ration stamps, and you want Baldwin in your freezers at your local store, and you want Parker House Sausage in your local store, stop shopping at the store.  And that's what the people did.  They stopped, stopped going to these stores.  And then the stores called Kit Baldwin and Judge Parker and said,"You know, you can come into our stores."  And that's the way Baldwin and Parker House Sausage got into these stores.  So--and, of course, the, the South Side [Chicago, Illinois] was a ghetto really because they had a, it was black belt around it.  Blacks could live in this section, and if they passed over to the other section which might be across the street, literally, that house over there had a clause in its deed that said, "This house cannot be sold to a black person."  So, so, so we were restricted to this one area and to these, these stores in this area.  So that's what existed when, when, when my husband [Joseph J. Robichaux] and I bought Baldwin.  We'd only serve--we served all of the major stores, grocery stores in the area, but only in that area, you see.  And so, so Baldwin was, was distributed in that area.
Speaker 2: When your husband invited you to work with the company--
Speaker 1: --He told me (laughter), he told me.
Speaker 2: "I need help, honey."  (Laughter).
Story_ID: 19524
Speaker 1: You were gonna share with us how it was when you started working day-to-day at Baldwin [Ice Cream, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Well, because the company was in such financial straits, my husband [Joseph J. Robichaux] did not feel it was wise for him with a family of three to quit his job at, at Wanzer [Dairy, Chicago, Illinois].  So he retained his job, and I was there to see, to be his eyes and ears as to what was going on with the company.  And I was shocked because the, the, the Baldwin family that was still there had, had--had not used modern business practices.  There was one whole wall that was maybe it was nine--eight or nine feet, was piled up to the ceiling with invoices from the drivers that had never been used to make the, the invoices for the money to come in.  There was no check balance.  The employees were paid on Friday with the hopes that Saturday and Sunday's receipts in the ice cream parlor would cover the, the payroll.  The sales tax was defined by guesswork.  The accountant came in when it was time for the first sales tax report, and told me to give him a number from one to five.  And then give him another number from three to seven.  And he wrote these numbers down, and it, it came to a five, five-digit number with a decimal.  And he says, "Okay, now we have our sales, and we'll pay tax on this."  And it was, it was in, in quite a state.  So I, I told my husband, you know, how--the way that things were, were being done.  And he, he told me, you know, how to change it, you know, gradually, because they were so entrenched.  They'd been doing this for years.  They were truly concerned about the drivers' inventory, but not, not taxes, not the receipts.  And I knew that, that there was some theft going on in the stores.  I knew that, oh, there were--it was just wild.  But, and things were done very gradually.  It changed.  The Baldwin family was not the most pleased that I was there.  And, but yet, I felt that in being loyal to our word to Archibald Cary [former Baldwin Ice Cream shareholder], that we could not fire them.  So we had to keep them.  And my training in, in college at Chicago Teachers College [Chicago, Illinois] came in handy because I set up an in-service training program to educate the office staff, as well as the other staff people as to how to read and write because there was only one person out of that entire staff that had graduated from high school.  And so I had, I had teachers that came in and were taught--and taught them the basics of what, the kind of--I didn't really want them to do anything other than give me a written report.  And I had, I taught them how to, you know, to write certain words and how to put numbers and decimal points if necessary, you know, in, in a certain column in this, in, in-service training program.  And I gave--and all of the people in the company were never called by their first name.  They were called Mr. Jones or Mr., like that.  They liked that.  And after--we set up a policy that after a certain number of months of performance--oh, I also had job descriptions, wrote job descriptions and which were circulated to everybody else.  So everybody knew what everybody else was supposed to do.  And after a certain number of months, if they performed according to--if their evaluation was good, they got a business card.  And, and everybody was supervisor of something (chuckle).  And so everybody was working to get these reports, to get this job description done, which some of them couldn't read and had the children read the job description to them, so that they could get their business card.  And so that they could pass it out to people, you know, I'm the supervisor of electronic--oh, I, I had all kind of fancy titles (laughter).  So that was the best group I, really, that was the best group of employees I had, those people who were uneducated, but found out that--their role in the company and how important that role was.  I never had absences--I wouldn't I say I never had absences, but tardinesses, absences, which was nonexistent practically.  Everybody came to work early and got their job done and because they were Mr. so and so and so with a business card whose--they were supervisor.  So that's the way it started out.
Story_ID: 19525
Speaker 1: How long did that turn-around take you?
Speaker 2: Maybe a year, year and a half maybe.  So, so then, so who was it--then I found out about an organization called Talent Assistance Program.  And it was sponsored by the government.  And the, this Office Talent Assistance Program, which was called TAP, T-A-P, TAP, would find an executive with a large corporation who wanted to give his time to help a minority business.  And I was assigned a guy named Leonard Abrahamson.  And we had an interview, and he asked me, why did I want to take over the company, and, and which I told that my husband [Joseph J. Robichaux] thought it was a business, a family business, and my daughter [Sheila Glaze] told me that that's what I should do.  And since so many people had laughed at me because of that, I felt I had a--I wanted to show them that I could do it.  And, and he says--and then I said, "I want to make money."  And he says, "No, take that last thing out.  Don't--no, no.  Put--let's work on the other reasons you want to, to keep this business, and not focus on the money because that will come if you, if you can accomplish all the other things you want."  And he, he worked very closely with me for years, it turns out, because--and he, and, and I told him that I wanted my MBA in Service Training.  And I wanted to really know how to run a company 'cause I was, I was smart enough to know that I didn't know anything (laughter).  So, and, and he would tell, you know, he would--he, he never was commanding.  He would always give me a reason why we should, why he thought certain things.  One of the first things he did, he told me to, to buy a big blackboard, a great big one, maybe like eight by four or something like that, and put it up on the wall, and to have the drivers--and to record what their, their sales were by gallons every day because they were going around telling you, "Oh, man, I sold a whole lot today."  And, and, you know, but the other drivers didn't know what they had sold.  So we would put it on the, on the blackboard.  And once we did that, I mean it--there was four or three, three guys then.  I mean they worked hard because they didn't want those funny-looking numbers up there.  And so I thought that was a very good suggestion and little things like that.  And it--so, I, I learned.
Speaker 1: So you were actually running the company before your husband?
Speaker 2: No, I wouldn't say that because he, he had the last say.  And, no, no, I don't--
Speaker 1: But it was like day-to-day, not, not operations, but you were--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was there every day, and I, I did have some control.  But--and, but there were, there was a sales, there was a manager, not sales, there was a manager who, who held more clout than I.  And I realized that one day when I wanted to change the color of the, the driveway door--what do you call it?  The garage door.  I, I thought it should be gray, but it was painted a kelly green.  And I went out and bought the gray paint.  And I had to leave it, in some way, while the guy was painting.  And when I came back later on, it was green.  So I knew I didn't have that much clout because every time my husband--this, this manager would come in the house and throw the keys on the floor and say, "I quit!"  And my husband would, would take him back.  And so, no, I didn't run the company then, but I got a lot of experience.  I knew exactly what was going on.
Speaker 1: But you made some very effective changes--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that allowed for improvement.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and now, the TAP guy didn't come in until after my husband died.
Story_ID: 19526
Speaker 1: Would you tell us about the period where, you know, you increased efficiency through your in-training program, and the period when things were getting better and how that was seen?  And they were better before your husband died, right?  Or was that-- (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they, they were, it was definitely better before he died because some of the programs were getting started.  Well, we realized that with good management, the company could be profitable.  That was the main thing that we learned.  And so--and my husband started listening to me a little bit more.  And, and all of this time I'm telling him that the ice cream parlors, while they were great, and they were the, the--they were the reason that the company got started in the first place, but the money wasn't really there.  The big profits were in wholesale.  And it was difficult for me to show him that at first because I didn't, I wasn't, I'm not an accountant, never was.  And I--but gradually, I was able to show him, you know, how--that we actually made more money, could have made more if we weren't sending it to the, to the receivers.  And, and he was, we were realizing that we had a potential goldmine on our hands.  So, but then he died.
Story_ID: 19527
Speaker 1: His death, was it sudden?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, it was--relatively.  He [Joseph J. Robichaux], he started complaining of pains in his stomach.  And he broke out in red splotches all over his body. And the doctor said that he was allergic to mosquitoes in Chicago [Illinois] in April.  And I said, "That's not true.  You can't, there's no,"--and he took him to the hospital and found out he had leukemia.  And--but it was, it had progressed so far.  And he was going down so fast that they couldn't find the right kind of medicine to put it into remission.  But while he was in the hospital, it came--an incident occurred that made me decide that I was going to stay with Baldwin [Ice Cream, Chicago, Illinois] because I had the option of being a school teacher, 'cause--and, and naturally, the, the doctors had told me that his, his situation was terminal within the ten days that he first had the episode and the day he died.  But the--I got a call while I at the hospital saying that the, the man was there with the trucks. I said, "What man with what trucks?"  They said, "We have three new ice cream trucks here."  And I said, I asked my husband, "What, what is this?"  And he said, "Oh, I bought some trucks."  He hadn't told me he had bought these new trucks.  And, and I had told him that I thought we needed them, but he hadn't told me he'd bought them.  These three trucks were at 48th and Indiana.  We were at, at Michael Reese Hospital, knowing that he's gonna die in a few day--I knew that he was gonna die in a few days, and what to do?  So I told the, the clerk at the office to send him to the hospital.  And when he came, I put--I had a mask over my face.  And I said, "My husband has a condition that he's highly infectious," you know, what do you call it?
Speaker 1: Contagious.
Speaker 2: Contagious, yeah.  "So we can't go in there.  So let me see these papers."  And he said, he said, "Okay," and sure enough, they were the papers with, it was--back then, each truck was around twenty-five thousand.  So I had $75,000 worth of bills here.  And I took them into the office, into the, my husband's room, and I signed them.  I signed my husband's name on them.  And I told him he couldn't come in because his germs would kill him, and mine wouldn't (laughter).  So, so I signed them, I signed his name on it.  And I gave the papers to him, and he says, "Okay, everything's all set."  And now, I know that I have incurred a $75,000 debt.  And, and my husband was gonna die in a few days.  And so, it was, it was, it was a pivotal decision that I made that day because I know that once he died, they were not gonna, gonna give me, an untried, stupid woman, a $75,000 loan.  And so I did it before.
Speaker 1: You were doing some fast and wise thinking to even come to the decision to--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah, sometimes you get inspired.  And you make good decisions.  I've made some bad decisions, but that one was a good one.
Story_ID: 19528
Speaker 1: Because you already mentally had the plan for the wholesale process you envisioned?
Speaker 2: Well, I knew that's where the money was.  And I knew that we needed the trucks in order to, to be efficient.
Speaker 1: But here again, in this transition period, is crucial things happening, like all at once.  Your husband [Joseph J. Robichaux] died--(simultaneous)--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Taking on the new debt, trying to figure out how to execute this vision.  How did you finesse that?
Speaker 2: I guess the same way I did when I found out my hus--my father [Edward Howard] was gonna die.  And, and this motto I have, you know, that "I'm the master of my fate," now (chuckle).  You know, I can't blame anybody else.  I can't let anybody make a decision about my life.  I have to do it myself.  I, I don't know how I did it.  Sometimes I think back and wonder, "How did I do all those things?"  And my, my little boy [Joseph Robichaux] was asthmatic.  He used to--I stayed up all night, every night with him.  And so--
Speaker 1: And how long did it take you after you, you know, after the trucks were on the street, so to speak, how did it take you to start seeing, you know, payback, if you will, from that investment?
Speaker 2: Well, it was almost immediate.  And I--when, when my husband died two days later, I told the office staff to, to make appointments with all the chain stores, and that I was gonna come in to the chain store and ask for more space because up to this time, we just got what, what they, whichever particular store manager wanted to give us space.  But the only way we could make more money is to have more space in the freezer.  And so, I made appointments with all of the chain stores.  And I had all of the data showing what our sales were.  And I, I forgot how much I--was it twenty percent or something like that, that I would increase the sales by X percent, by X date if they would allow me to have more space.  And I went there, to these different chain stores.  The first time they had ever seen anybody at all at, at, at these chain stores, and a black woman too.  And what, when I, I would have a meeting with each one of these chain, the office was packed with these, these white men looking at me smirking (laughter), you know, like this, (imitating a smirk), as if to say "This woman is stupid."  But I went in there, and--with a black dress on, black stockings, black shoes, black hat with a little black veil and said that "I am here to, I'm the president of this company, and I've got children to raise.  I'm gonna make this a success.  Here's our sales, here's our projections.  And after that period, if I wasn't up to those projections, we would talk again.  And then you can do whatever you want to do," 'cause I was afraid they were gonna put me out completely, once they found out that my husband was dead.  And, so I told all the drivers, I said, "This is where we've got to go."  And, and I told all the other people, I said, "Now, if we want this to be true, everybody's got to work together."  And I'm telling you, everybody did.  It was beautiful.  It was beautiful.  And we made the projections.
Story_ID: 19529
Speaker 1: Take me back to, just for a hot minute, and I know you are writing a book on ice cream wars--
Speaker 2: (Chuckle) yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --but if you would just give me a peek regarding how Baldwin Ice Cream Company actually got started, and how did blacks get into ice cream, so to speak?
Speaker 2: Okay, well, now, all of this is hearsay because I wasn't around in 1921.  But people would tell me stories of these seven black men who worked at the post office.  And they would sit in, on, on, in the cafeteria table and talk.  And they knew that they were smart.  They knew that they were well educated.  And they thought that the only way to, to, to increase their income would be to go in business.  So the question was, "Well, what kind of business?"  Well, one of the guys, I understand was from Georgia.  And he said, "Well, I worked for an ice cream company down in Georgia, so I know how to make ice cream."  And the other guys said, "Well, you know, that would be great because all of us got families.  You know, we could have our children working in the ice cream parlor, which would be good for them.  We--our hours are flexible, you know.  One guy could work from, one shift and another guy could work.  There're seven of us."  And they said, "Let's link all of our resources, our money, our talents, our work forces, and we'll call the company Seven Links."  And it was a circle of seven links.  And so that's the way it got started, and true enough to his projection, this guy from Georgia made a very good ice cream.  What--one of the things that differentiated Baldwin from the other was the amount of fruit that they put into there.  Most of the other ice cream, you know, had little teeny bits of pecans, you know, or a little squirt of red something that looked like strawberries.  But we put whole strawberries in, we put, you know, halves of pecans in, you know, and the black walnut had, you know, big bits in there.  The pineapple ice cream had great big chunks of it.  And so we just became very famous for the quality of, of our ice cream.  And it was still a twelve percent butterfat, which was normal.  But it had good ingredients.  And, in the first ice cream parlor they had, they did something that is a very recent marketing tool.  The, the back of, right behind where the freezers were and the, the corridor for the, the ice cream clerks, they had a glass wall.  And the people, as they came into the parlor could see the ice cream being made behind, you know, in the back.  So--
Speaker 1: So did--how did Baldwin--when it was the original Baldwin, did they only sell to blacks?  Did they ever get into the market--(simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: You can't get, in, back in those days, the black market was the only market.  You did not sell to white people.  White people thought they got sick if they ate black ice cream (laughter).  I mean I found that out later on when we were marketing.  And we would go to trade shows.  And we found out that white people wouldn't buy it.  They said, "We get sick if we eat a, ice cream made by black people."  So I, I stopped putting up pictures with, with, with, in the, in the production.  I always showed white folks or black people eating it, you know.  But, so--
Story_ID: 19530
Speaker 1: Now, we're going back to after the success of the things you implemented.  And you could see everything going in the way you wanted it and you certainly worked and put forth the effort for it to go that way, what then were your primary challenges as you continued to grow and--?
Speaker 2: Well, the primary challenges was for the company [Baldwin Ice Cream] to continue under black ownership under my, my leadership.  The--I was determined that it wasn't gonna fail, although many times I thought it was, but, you know, but that was the impetus.  I didn't want it to fail under my, my--and I always, when, when I was young and, and I always wanted to be somebody.  And I always wanted to be something unique.  And I used to say that every night before I went to bed.  "I am going to do something that no one else has ever done."  So I couldn't sing, and I couldn't dance.  I wasn't pretty.  So, I, I didn't know what I could do, but I wanted to do something.  So when Joe [Joseph J.] Robichaux asked me to marry him, I said, "Well, and I can do it, I can be the best wife Joe Robichaux ever had."  So that's, that's unique.  So that was the only goal then, but then after he died, I, I--I didn't know what I was gonna do.  But it turned out that I said, well, I was the only black in the industry.  I was the only woman in the industry, boom, did it, you know.  So, but as time went on, I got a different type of employee, you know, college graduates and guys with masters [degrees] and stuff like that.  None was as productive as those uneducated people I had in the first place, interestingly enough.  But I did have some good, loyal people, and that, that--'cause I, I never can say that I did this all by myself, 'cause I had to have good people some place along the way, and I did.
Story_ID: 19531
Speaker 1: How did you come to the decision to sell [Baldwin Ice Cream, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Hah, well, none--neither of my children wanted to be any part of the company.  My, my daughter [Sheila Glaze] wanted to, yeah, my daughter wanted to, and she--I sent her to University of Iowa in the Business Administration.  And the plan was for, for her to come in after she--she worked two or three years, you know, out in the public sector.  Then she was to come to me at Baldwin, and then I would train her to be the, the president.  That was the plan, but while she was in school, she met this guy who was studying to be a doctor.  And she married him.  Now, my plan--he, he lives in Dallas, Texas.  Now, what am I gonna do?  I don't have her--she sent me the most beautiful letter, apologizing for marrying because she knew that our plan, you know, had gone awry.  But her happiness was more important than anything.  My son [Joseph Robichaux] is one of those nerds, and all he wanted to do was, you know,  talk scientific stuff and all like that.  And he later on became, got his doctorate in computational fluid dynamics.  So he wasn't interested in the business.  So I knew at some point I was going to have to do something.  It--stay there until I, you know, became senile or something.  And, but I knew I had to sell to somebody.  And in my mind, I had an idea who I wanted, but as I got older, people started saying, you know, I think I--you know,"You, you have to retire."  But there were the nerdiest--I mean not nerdiest, stupid-type people, you know, who had no idea of how to bring the company forward.  So Joe [Joseph J.] Robichaux had a guy that was at high school in St. Elizabeth's, who later became a leading lawyer here in, in Chicago [Illinois].
Story_ID: 19532
Speaker 1: We're continuing with the pro--(unclear) and the process leading up to the (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, I think I was saying that, that there was this lawyer who had been a protégé of my husband's [Joseph J. Robichaux], called me up one morning about seven-thirty, eight o'clock in the morning, which I thought was unusual, at home, and said, "Jolyn, are you interested in selling your company [Baldwin Ice Cream]?"  And I said "Absolutely not."  It was no sense in me going around and telling everybody I want to sell my company, you know, but, because, because at that point, I mean I was raking it in.  That's after, you know, after I got this award, and I had decided to go national.  And he said, "Well, tell me, you know, I have an idea about how old you are, and at some point, you're gonna have to do something if you"--'cause he did know that my kids weren't interested.  And so I, I made up a profile.  I said, "Well, he's got to be black, and it has to be a man," because I know what, what the national situation was.  I felt it would be better for a man at this point.  "He has to know something about production or manufacturing and marketing.  And he's got to have a lot of money."  And he says, "I have him sitting right next to me."  And I said, "What's his name?"  And he said, "I'll, I'm not gonna tell you right now.  But if, if those are your criteria, we'll--I'll set up a meeting, and, and we'll all get together."  And so it turned out that the person whom he suggested did have all of the qualifications.  And, oh, I wanted a young man.  Some of these guys who were talking, were, you know, seventy, eighty years old talking about they wanted to buy the company, you know.  And so that's the way it, that's the way it happened.
Speaker 1: And so Eric Johnson is--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he bought the company.
Speaker 1: --continued the, the Baldwin name and product.
Speaker 2: And he, he has fulfilled the, what, what I wanted, to take the company to a different level.  And I, I really did not feel that I had the connections for--I could, I could--it, it would have stayed profitable, but I really wanted it to go to another level.  And he, he took it to another level.  So he, and it worked out fine.
Speaker 1: So did the transition period, the selling transition period, how long did that take?
Speaker 2: Just a few months, about three months.
Speaker 1: And since you had not been actually sitting up nights thinking about selling, what was that like for you?  Did you make the switch in a much shorter period--?
Speaker 2: Well, it's, it's common sense, really, you know.  I was, what, about sixty-four, sixty--yeah, I was sixty-four when, when this happened.  And, but I, I, I knew that I had--it was worth quite a bit because now--you haven't asked me about the award that I got from the President.
Speaker 1: I was gonna ask you about that next--
Story_ID: 19533
Speaker 1: So when I got the award as Minority Entrepreneur of the Year, for the United States, that made Baldwin [Ice Cream] a nationally known, 'cause it was a singular award, the White House and blah, blah, blah, you know.  It was a big deal at the time.  And whereas we were doing very well in the Chicago [Illinois] market, because we had expanded from, from the black belt area that we were allocated to all over the city of Chicago, in all of the chains and in all of the suburbs.  So we, we, according to the Nielsen rating, we were seventh in the city, you know, with, with all these big national companies, which is pretty good rating.  And then I got this award, and, you know, I had to figure out, well, what am I gonna do with it?  And I thought, "Well, I'll just use that in order to go to the presidents of these chain stores and get other areas allocated to, to Baldwin."  And, and, and that's where the Chicago, Chicago State University helped me, because I went to their Business Department and asked them if they would help me research all of these companies so that, that I would know everything about these companies.  And then I had a, I developed a video, and all, all the data, some of which you have, to show them that I was nationally known, the product was.  And, and I made, made appointments with no one less than the president of Kroger's and A&Ps and all these guys, wherever they were.  If there was, if they were officed in New York or wherever, I went there and made my pitch.  And I also had a good sales manager at that time too, and the two of us went.  And we--so we were well known, and--which, which made selling it a little better (laughter).
Story_ID: 19534
Speaker 1: And, and then I had the, the ice cream parlors out to O'Hare and, which was a disaster, an absolute disaster.
Speaker 2: What made you go into the airport and did it take a different kind of knowledge or experience to work the airport?
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, what I had--after I, my husband [Joseph J. Robichaux] died and I realized that the wholesale routes were the, were the money thing, I, I made a mission statement that said, "Our business is wholesale.  We will maintain a retail operation at the plant, but we are now a wholesale company."  Part of the, my management strategy was always to have the employees involved in management decisions.  And, oh, about every two months, we would have a joint meeting with everybody on the staff, janitor or whatever, you know.  And, and we would discuss where we were and what we wanted to do.  Well, the employees got this idea about going into the airport.  And, and I really wasn't keen on it, but I, I--I started working on it.  And--because at first, it sounded really good, like there'd be a whole lot of money, you know, Chicago [Illinois] was the best, highest volume airport in the country at the time.  And so it took me two years to get it, and the only way I got it--you want to hear that 'cause I, I am proud of, this little trick I played, 'cause, you know, here we're talking about Haagen-Daz, Bresler's, all these big [ice cream] companies had been trying to get out there, and none of them could get there.  So the--'cause they, they used as their, as their objection to these other companies, the fact, if they had a contract with Carson's International [Inc.], that, that took care of all liquor and all food.  And that it could not be broken, that, that Carson's had the contract.  And so one day after I had made several appeals to the city, the Department of Aviation, I saw a little newspaper ad that, that they were having some problems with the noise, the residents out there were fussing and carrying on.  And, and it said in there that, that the airport was a government installation.  A government?  You know.  I didn't know that.  And I found out that sure enough, it is, that the airports have a government base, you know, and the city just kind of rents from them, or whatever.  And so, how can they have an exclusive contract?  And so I asked them, you know, if, if I could see their contract.  "Oh, no, no, we don't, we can't show you that."  So the Freedom of Information Act, I wrote a letter to them, and I said, "I'd like to see the contract to Chicago Airport, Carson's International."  And they sent it to me.  And in the contract, it said--see, they were smart, they knew that they shouldn't have an exclusive contract.  So they had, "Carson's can sell to O'Hare Airport every, all foods and all drinks except ice cream and popcorn."  And that was all I needed.  And so I never had been the kind of person that wants to confront somebody, you know.  So I--it was the, was it the FE--F--Federal Aviation Department [ref. to the FAA, Federal Aviation Administration] or something like that.  So they had an office on Washington [D.C.].  So I went up there one day, and I had a big envelope with, with my--all that info--some of that information that I gave you.  And I said, I have an appoint--you know, and I told them a short history of how I wanted an ice cream parlor out to O'Hare.  And I said, I've got the contract, and I know that, that Carson's does not have an exclusive, and that they--and that ice cream is one of the products that can be sold.  I'm a Chicago company, a woman-owned company.  And, and they have been telling me all of this.  I now know different, and I'm having a meeting next week with them.  And I just thought you'd like to know.  And I used to be a secretary, of course, and I gave the package, un--unsealed to the receptionist 'cause I knew what was gonna happen.  They were gonna open it up and read it.  And so the word got out from the Federal government, you know, who wanted the city to open up something about the air--open up, and I'm not sure of, exactly what it was.  And they told the Chicago Department of Aviation that Jolyn Robichaux knows that, that, that the contract is not valid, the excuse is not valid anymore.  She has all of the qualifications to be a--and, if, if you want this, if you want us to give you these thousands and thousands of dollars, you know, you cannot go around telling everybody you have an exclusive contract.  So sure enough, the meeting I went to, they granted me, "Hey, Mrs. Robichaux, we want you to know that we, you have been so wonderful about this that we are going to give you permission to have the ice cream parlors."  And, ah, they--so, so they not only gave me one.  They gave me five ice cream parlors.  And I had, I--each, each parlor cost me 200,000 [dollars] to build.  And I, I didn't have any trouble getting the money, but that was more debt than I really wanted to get into.  And then after I got in there, they had the election of--mayoral election, and Harold Washington got in.  And whereas the, the mayor used to be able just to, her say-so was all that was necessary, cause Jane Byrne was, was mayor then.  And when, when Harold Washington got in, they changed the rule, and they said, no mayor can tell them what to do as to the airport.  They had to go through the City Council.  So here I had close to $100,000 in construction costs and, and I couldn't get in.  I'd hired people.  I stole them from different, McDonald's and Burger Kings, you know, as managers to--but I, I couldn't, I couldn't open up because--until the City Council let me open up.  And I was losing money like mad, losing money like mad.  And so when I opened up, I was already in a real big hole.  And, and it just kept getting worse and worse and worse.  And, and they didn't want me to sell, cause I wanted to sell because they said, and the drain was coming out of my wholesale, you see, to--you know, this, as far as--and they didn't want me to sell because I'd made such a big splurge 'cause I was the very first minority out there, 'cause they--it looked bad for me to get in there and come out so quick, you know.  So, it was a mess.  So the original question was, how did what?
Speaker 2: How did that go, you know--
Speaker 1: Yeah--so I, so, so that's, that's what I, that was one of the times when I thought I was gonna fail because I was--everything was coming out of the wholesale, and I couldn't put back into the wholesale where, where my money was coming in 'cause I'm losing it out there at the airport.
Speaker 2: So it was like an eating cancer?
Speaker 1: Yeah, but eventually, I was able to sell.
Speaker 2: At the time you sold it, had you stabilized at the airport?
Speaker 1: I never stabilized.  It was steady losing money all the time.
Speaker 2: Did the airport activity require any different kind of knowledge from what you already had?
Speaker 1: Well, it, in a way, yes, because, even though I was able--I had, I hired managers, you know, and an assistant manager who cost a lot of money to watch all of these stores because I couldn't--the caliber of these people were not as good as I would have liked to have had.  And being so far away, and even though they had to send their cash register tapes in, you know, five cash register tapes a day and the girls in the office working on it sometimes miss things, like, you know, how can you buy forty gallons of milk and the cash register say--tape says you only sold ten milk shakes?  And so they, they miss things like that.  And I found out that the, the store managers were placating the employees by giving them gallons of milk to take home to their children.  And, you know, things like that.
Story_ID: 19535
Speaker 1: So when it was bought, he closed it or he had to maintain the contract to the end?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  I, I found a guy who wanted to buy, and who was approved by the city, and I sold it to him and got out of all of the, the loans and everything that I had.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, so you, the selling off the airport section was separate from the basic wholesale operation?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, that was done before I sold the company, yeah.  And, which made it much better because now my profit and loss statement looks much better cause I'm making money, big money down here, whereas before it was, you know, by the time, you got to the bottom line--although I was making money, I still made money.  I never, after a certain point, never--after like, what, about five years after I got the company I was making money.  And I never--I always made money.  But it was rough.  And, and, you see, it was the airport contract that got me so much publicity and, and, of course, I couldn't say anything to anybody--I didn't want to say anything to anybody, you know, while I'm getting all--"Oh, Jolyn Robichaux got the, this contract, you know, when everybody else tried to get it, and she got it, and nobody else did," and blah, blah, blah.  And all of the other ice cream companies were jealous of me because I got it.  And all they had to do with all their high-falutin' lawyers is ask for the contract, and nobody thought of it.  So I made national coverage for me being the first minority concessionaire, and I'm gonna tell people that I'm losing money?  That didn't sound too smart.  So I had to, you know, raise my head up and act like I was just doing great, and I was losing money like mad.
Speaker 1: And there was nothing that could be done in the City Council by asking for some kind of, you know--?
Speaker 2: Well, no,
Speaker 1: (Unclear) on the decision that was holding it?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, oh, now, I had the ice cream parlors for about five years.  It only took me about a year for, for, to get control.
Speaker 1: Okay, you had the ice cream parlors, but the minute they changed it from the way it was under [Mayor] Jane Byrne to having, forcing [Mayor] Harold Washington to go through the full [City] Council, there was nothing, no one you could go to, to ask them--?
Speaker 2: No, the only reason I got in was cause my husband [Joseph J. Robichaux] was so well known as a politician that some of the politicians on that Council Board that had to do with the airport okayed it because they said, you know, "Are you Joe Robichaux's widow?"  "Yes, I am."  "Okay."  And they signed off on it.  So Joe Robichaux still was playing a part.
Story_ID: 19536
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit about his political--?
Speaker 2: Well, Joe [Joseph J. Robichaux] wanted to, Joe wanted to be in politics.  I didn't want him to be at first, but he told me one day, he said, "You know, we have to have politicians, and we have to have politicians who know how to handle power.  And I know how to handle power."  And, now, this is about, at two years, of me saying, "No, way, honey, I don't want you to be in politics."  And he went along with it.  And then he told me that, and it made sense.  So I knew he knew how to handle power.
Speaker 1: And what was his political--(simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: He was a Democrat.  He was a Democratic Ward Committeeman of the Twenty-First Ward.  And, and he was Jury Commissioner for Cook County, as well as being at Wanzer [Dairy].
Speaker 1: And did he stay at Wanzer till his death?
Speaker 2: --Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 19537
Speaker 1: Is there anything about the business [Baldwin Ice Cream] operation that I should have asked you that I didn't?
Speaker 2: The business operation that you didn't.  It seems like you asked me an awful lot of questions (chuckle).  We, we were highly respected in the, in the ice cream industry at, at a, at one point.  We were, as, you know, the only black-owned ice cream company, and I was surely the only woman in the ice cream industry.  And I, I'm very proud of that.  I'm very proud that I was able to gain the respect of all of these companies.  Matter of fact, I used them quite a bit early on to get new--get accounts.  But we were, we worked very hard, and we had the reputation for being very professional.  And I, I worked with the community and different projects, and we had, we had the Baldwin buses that took, took high school--not high school, grammar school kids to, to universities on little weekend trips to, to see what a campus, a college campus looked like, and let them walk through and see, hoping to inspire them--these seventh and eighth grade girls and boys, to, to go to college so that they would have some kind of feel of what a college was like.  I--we had scholarships.  The company gave loans for houses and cars to our employees so they didn't have to go to banks for these kind of things.  Let's see, I can't think.  I, I knew we did something else that was, so I can't think of it right now.
Speaker 1: So you had some very forward-looking policies?
Speaker 2: (nods head yes.)
Speaker 1: And little did you know you would be using all that Labor Relations information (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: --that you learned earlier.
Story_ID: 19538
Speaker 1: So, I always say that no matter how bad a thing is, no matter how tragic a situation is, from that tragedy comes a phoenix, you know.  There's something, there's a spark that comes from that, that later on, when I say, oh, so and so and that, if I, if I got back far enough, I'll see.  It was this terrible, terrible thing that happened that was the impetus for this.  So I, I live like that now.
Speaker 2: Well, that's fabulous.  Well, the reason I was asking you about the business because, like a cat, you had nine lives or maybe even more because now you're in a whole new life, a rich, full life.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then when I went to Paris [France], of course, that was one of the, the things that I wanted to do, that would almost become an obsession, to go to Paris, to live in Paris.  And I got in business over there, so I made real big money over there.
Speaker 2: Tell me about that business venture.
Speaker 1: Well, it was an accident, but I worked with the American Cathedral in Paris, and the artistic director was a friend of mine.  And he would have programs that would bring in maybe 150 people.  But there was an organization out of California, a gospel group, seventy-five high school kids and they wanted to have a concert at the Cathedral.  In Paris, performing at the Cathedral was like here performing at Carnegie Hall.  They weren't gonna charge the church anything.  They just wanted to be there.  And he asked me to take over.  And--because he was involved in some medieval operas that, you know, and I took over.  And, and the day of the concert, and the first concert, the concert was at five o'clock, the, the--they had to call out, they had to call out the riot police, there were so many people in front of the Cathedral trying to get in.  So, so I got a name for myself as being able to promote the gospel [music performances.]  So I started bringing gospel performances from the United States over there.
Speaker 2: And you did that until you left?
Speaker 1: (nods head yes.)
Speaker 2: What made you decide to come back home?
Speaker 1: That's sort of a private decision.  It has to do with a man (laughter).

Story_ID: 19544
Speaker 1: Okay, so you, after about three years, you returned to Chicago [Illinois], no, not Chicago, to Dallas [Texas].
Speaker 2: To Dallas.
Speaker 1: What made you pick Dallas?
Speaker 2: Because my daughter [Sheila Glaze] lives there.
Speaker 1: Do you have any grandchildren?
Speaker 2: I have a twenty-one year old, junior in Pomona College [Claremont, California], granddaughter.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you said, you moved back for personal reasons.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell me something about your life since you moved back.
Speaker 2: It's, it's quite a change in that, that the culture seems so different.  I just fell in love with Paris [France] and the opportunity to travel to other countries fairly easily.  One of--when, when I got there, in Paris, although it was something that I had worked for, the goal had, took nine years to achieve, but when I got there, I said, what am I doing here?  And I had to write a mission statement (chuckle) to, to figure out why I was there.  And one of the, one of the points was that I would learn more about art.  And so, some book I read had selected the twenty best art museums in Europe.  So that was my goal, to go to, to all twenty of these museums.  And so I would go there and stay at least a week because I went to the, to the museum every day.  I'd open it up, and I closed it for about four days.  And then the other two or three days I used to tour the city.  And so I, I learned a lot, you know, culturally, you know, and I can go in a place and say, oh, that's [Peter Paul] Ruben[s], that a [Pablo] Picasso [artists] or whatever, you know, cause I'm pretty good on that now.  And I enjoyed that.  And the other was to learn about different cultures.  So it was very difficult for me to adjust to Dallas, not because they didn't have other cultures and not because they didn't have good art, but because I was going through a mourning period, and because I had lost something.  I'd lost Paris, I thought.  I had--I did, I did.  I was going to, this gentleman and I were going to go back to Paris, you see.  But we didn't (laughter).  So, at first, at first it was just an adjustment to the city and how the streets go and where to find the grocery store and all that kind of stuff.  But then when I, when I realized that I wasn't going to go back, it--I went through a mourning period.  But now I've, I've adjusted to the fact that this is--
Speaker 1: And you were involved in art, art classes or--?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.  I studied art and classes--
Speaker 1: In Dallas [Texas]?  Aren't you taking an art course or--?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm a volunteer, I'm a volunteer guide in the Art District in Dallas.  Dallas has the largest geographical area devoted to, to cultural activities, museums, the Museum of Art, the Symphony Hall, the Museum of Oriental Arts, the Dallas Black Ballet, several churches that are involved in artistic endeavors.  And I take--on the first Saturday of every month, and other Saturdays also, I take these groups, you know, through a tour of all of this.
Story_ID: 19545
Speaker 1: And how do you find time to work on your book?
Speaker 2: I have, I have not as, been as persistent as I should be.  Last year I was quite ill, but, so I didn't do anything.  But now, it's readjusting my life, and, and getting started with this, going back to the book.  I've, I've got something like three hundred and some odd pages, but there aren't, they aren't done the way I want to do.  So I have to--but I found--I already have an agent.  And the agent is about to give me a fit 'cause she wants me to hurry and finish so she can get it--I, I don't think I'm going to have any trouble getting it published.
Speaker 1: And tell us what the book is about?
Speaker 2: Well, it's, it's, the title of it at this point, is called 'After the Ice Cream War.'  People don't realize that in Chicago [Illinois] in the 1930s there was indeed an ice cream war.  Just like they, they slit tires of the trucks, they broke the windshields, and they killed a couple of people in order for the, the--to get a share, the market share in the freezers. It was all of these different ice cream companies fighting each other.  And I, I know it's true because these different old guys, you know, in the ice cream industry used to tell me about it.  But it was the--in order to try to keep this ice cream war from getting any worse than it was, the city of Chicago and the unions in Chicago developed a, a process which would satisfy everybody.  They said, in essence, that, that no ice cream could be made in the city of Chicago unless it had a Board of Health certification stamp on it.  In order to get a Board of Health certification stamp, the inspector from Chicago, the Board of Health, had to go to the plant--makes sense, right?  But the, the tires on the inspector's car always blew out at the state line.  So the inspectors never got to Michigan or Indiana or wherever.  So they were always--they could never get to New York or wherever these other ice cream companies were.  So--unless this company built a, a factory in Chicago.  Now, the, the factory is, has some new members in the ice cream union, right?  And so now, we've got--and what, when, when I took over Baldwin [Ice Cream Company] there was, there were twenty-one ice cream companies that manufactured ice cream in the city of Chicago.  Now, you got all these companies into Chicago.  What's to keep them from fighting each other?  The city and unions got together and said, and, and they listed all of the chain stores.  And they listed all of the ice cream manufacturers.  And they said, this chain will be serviced by this manufacturer, and this chain will be serviced by this manufacturer, all like that.  No one can infringe on this chain store operation, none of these other guys.  Now, the independent stores, okay, they can kind of rush around there, but, you know, it's not too important.  So that solved everything.  So when I, when I went into the market, everybody had, had just one chain.  But then after this boycott of the black people, they put Baldwin in all of the chains, you see.  We were in all of them, but the other manufacturers had, were allocated just to this one chain store.  Now, that, but now that one chain store kept them busy.  I mean they were profitable with that one chain store because it was so big, Chicago's a big place.  And so the story is going to talk about that, the role that this little black company had in, in, in this market.  The lawsuit that a company called Dixie Dairy in Indiana made against the city of Chicago after Mayor [Richard J.] Daley died [1976], for restriction of trade, and won, which meant that these companies here in Chicago that had--were ruled by the, the, the unions who could, could--the average, the average worker in the ice cream union in 1975 was seventeen dollars an hour.  I mean, 'cause they, they could demand anything 'cause they controlled, you know, everything here.  So the ice cream that was made in Chicago cost more to a Kroger or a A&P [grocery store chains] than a company that made it in New York and had to transport it all the way here.  And so when the restriction of trade suit was, was won, that means these companies could come in.  And the A&Ps, the chain stores, they wanted the cheapest ice cream, you know, they want their margin to be higher.  So that meant that the Chicago plants went bankrupt or if they didn't go bankrupt, you know, if they were national, they would have to take the company out.  So who was the only ice cream company at the end?  Baldwin, little tiny, old Baldwin, was the only ice cream manufactured in, with a base in, in Chicago.  So, so the story is gonna be about this situation, about who Baldwin was, how it got started, how the employees worked together to make it a success, how a widow with two small children, a black woman in an all-male, white industry could succeed.  So it's gonna tell everything.

Speaker 1: Tell me, aside from your dad [Edward Howard], who has been the most influential person?
Speaker 2: After my father, well, I have to say my husband [Joseph J. Robichaux].  He--I saw the way he handled, not only his track girls, his--the, the athletic teams and his job in politics.  And he, indeed, knew power, and he knew how to handle it.  And I learned from him.  I learned from Leonard Abrahamson, the TAP [Talent Assistance Program] guy.  And I, I learned from my mother [Margaret Love Howard].  My mother was a, was a wise woman, again, not demonstrative, but--and she believed in me.  And, and I always try to live up to that.
Story_ID: 19547
Speaker 1: What do you think people will want to remember most about Jolyn Robichaux?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't--this, this video is gonna tell more things about Jolyn Robichaux than the average person knows.  So, some people will say, "Oh, Jolyn has a nice personality, you know.  Jolyn Robichaux can tell jokes.  Jolyn Robichaux, she tells"--I think my children [Sheila Glaze and Joseph Robichaux] will say I'm a good mother.  And, but as, people as a whole, I don't think--especially this generation, they don't know that I was there for twenty-five years and held a little company together to, to succeed--you know, ultimately succeed.  I, I know that--I don't--so, I think most of the things that, if anybody remembers me at all, will be good.
Speaker 1: It amazes me with your personality and your sense of humor that you're not in any branch of entertainment--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: How did you escape that?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  At one time, I used to dance and was trained professionally.  But I never wanted to go out and dance.  And when you see how, what a dancer I would be, oh God, no.  But--
Story_ID: 19548
Speaker 1: One question, just a comparison, and I know there's no direct comparison, but personal response.  What's the difference between living in Dallas [Texas] and living in Chicago [Illinois], other than the weather?
Speaker 2: Okay, other than the weather.  It, it's not fair to say, because I was culturally trained in Paris [France] with opera and ballet and all like that, and, and I have a greater appreciation for that, but there's more of that in, in Dallas than, than I saw in Chicago.  But then again, I was working seven days a week and, you know, long hours with either the company or the children [Sheila Glaze and Joseph Robichaux].  So maybe I shouldn't say that, but there is a lot of cultural activity going on in Dallas.  I, I don't live in a black neighborhood in Dallas, and, and that's a difference.  I don't, I, I'm--and that's probably a negative.  I probably would like to live in a black neighborhood.  So that is a difference.  The culture there is quite different as far as respect for older women.  I couldn't get over when I first went to Dallas how many men would rush to open the door for me, strangers.  I never noticed that so much here.  I mean it--black men, white men, just, you know, "She's gonna open the door (rushing sound) and let's open the door for the lady."  I get a lot of that there.  But I, I'm, have faced reality and I am going to enjoy Dallas (laughter).  And rue the day that I accepted a contractual relationship with this other person.  Oh, well, that was a good experience in the end, you know.
Story_ID: 19549
Speaker 1: Okay, let me ask you, what do you think of the HistoryMakers and the whole idea?
Speaker 2: I think it is wonderful.  I didn't know about it until I was approached.  I have a strong interest in knowing more about what our, what our people have done.  In Dallas [Texas], Negro--February is filled with, with radio--T.V. programs and rad--and newspaper articles.  And I learned a lot from what they say about the--so I know that there's so much more that I don't know.  And I think the HistoryMakers is going to provide that for those people that are interested to--and, and will be impressed by the vastness of the, of, of the history-making black populace.  I think that people just don't do, know.  I know I, I didn't.  So I think it's a wonderful contribution that you are making to the world.  I don't think just to black people, but to the world.
Speaker 1: And that's, we'd like to call it 'America's missing stories.'
Story_ID: 19550
Speaker 1: Who was my mother [Margaret Love Howard].  And she was born in 1910.  And I think maybe she's about two or three.  So that would make it 1912 or '13 [1913].
Speaker 2: [Jolyn Robichaux's mother, Margaret Love Howard, ca. 1912.  From the collection of Jolyn Robichaux.]
Story_ID: 19551
Speaker 1: The middle picture is, is her [Margaret Love Howard] when she was maybe about twelve.
Speaker 2: [Jolyn Robichaux's mother, Margaret Love Howard, ca. 1922.  From the collection of Jolyn Robichaux.]
Story_ID: 19552
Speaker 1: And the last picture is of her [Margaret Love Howard] with me in her arms.  So since I was born in 1928, it--this was taken in 1928 because I'm a very small baby.  I was born in May, so this was probably June or July.  My mother was a very beautiful woman, I thought.
Speaker 2: [Jolyn Robichaux with her mother, Margaret Love Howard, ca. June 1928.  From the collection of Jolyn Robichaux.]
Story_ID: 19553
Speaker 1: Okay, the one at the top is a picture of all of the, the sisters, the three sisters in our family.  That's--to the far right is a picture of me.  The middle one is my sister, Charlotte [Logan], who's a year and a half younger than I.  And the one to the far left is my half sister, Marsha Braddix, who is my mother's [Margaret Love Howard] daughter by a second marriage.  This was probably taken about four years ago, so that would be about 1998.
Speaker 2: [Jolyn Robichaux with her sisters, Charlotte Logan (center) and Marsha Braddix (left), ca. 1998.]
Story_ID: 19554
Speaker 1: And the one below is, was taken at the same time.  And that is my son, Joseph [Robichaux], to my--.  He was, it's not, he is not Joseph, Jr.  My husband [Joseph J. Robichaux] never wanted a son to be called Junior cause he said people--he'd seen so many people call, "Hey, Junior," you know (laughter).  And so his middle name is the same as my maiden name [Howard].
Speaker 2: [Jolyn Robichaux with her son, Joseph Robichaux, ca. 1998.  From the collection of Jolyn Robichaux.]
Story_ID: 19555

Speaker 2: [Jolyn Robichaux at one year old, 1929.  From the collection of Jolyn Robichaux.]
Story_ID: 19558
Speaker 1: The top left is my sister, Charlotte.  We're standing by the car with our luggage because we're on our way to a 'Heritage Tour,' we called it.  So my flew in from Chicago [Illinois] to Dallas [Texas], and then we took a car and drove to Illinois and visited all of the childhood haunts in Cairo, Illinois and southern Illinois and then central Illinois where we used to live.  Yeah, and the bottom one is just a picture of a table.
Speaker 2: And what year was this?
Speaker 1: 1998.
Speaker 2: [Jolyn Robichaux and her sister, Charlotte Logan (left), 1998.  From the collection of Jolyn Robichaux.]
Story_ID: 19559
Speaker 1: This is 1927.  The one at the top is on my mother and father's wedding day.  They were married on the lawn in front of my grandparents' [William and Charlotte Love] home, which is to the far left.

Story_ID: 19561
Speaker 1: The one to the, next is, is my mother [Margaret Love Howard] and father [Edward Howard] and the car that my grandmother [Charlotte Love] jumped in the back of.  Back in those days, the, the people liked to have pictures with their cars behind them to show influence, you know, "We had a car" (laughter).  So that was the, that was my father's car that he was going to take to, take my mother to Cairo, Illinois.
Speaker 2: And what year do you think this was?
Speaker 1: Twenty-seven [1927].
Speaker 2: [Jolyn Robichaux's parents, Edward and Margaret Love Howard, on their wedding day, Macon, Illinois, 1927.  From the collection of Jolyn Robichaux.]
Story_ID: 19562
Speaker 1: And this is my great-grandmother, my grandfather's [William Love] mother.  And she was seventy-five years old at the time, and I would suppose I'm about a year and a half old.  And that would make it 1929, '30, 1930.  It so happens that she's an Indian.  My great-grandfather was black, and she was a full-blooded Indian.  And they tell the stories about how she would get mad, and she'd pick up her teepee and go out in the woods.  And she'd stay for weeks (laughter), and my [great] grandfather would come out there with food.  And when she got ready to, she'd come back home.  She'd fold up her teepee and come back home.
Speaker 2: [Jolyn Robichaux with her great-grandmother, 1930.  From the collection of Jolyn Robichaux.]
Story_ID: 19563
Speaker 1: That's my mother [Margaret Love Howard].  I--I'm not sure, but, let's see.  It was probably.  It might have been a marriage picture.  So that would have been 1927.
Speaker 2: [Jolyn Robichaux's mother, Margaret Love Howard, 1927.  From the collection of Jolyn Robichaux.]
Story_ID: 19564
Speaker 1: This is a picture of Jolyn Love Howard [Robichaux], age one, one and a half, and with the famous family automobile in the background.  And right across from our house was the Post Office, and that's a little curb around the Post Office lawn.

Story_ID: 19565
Speaker 1: That's, that's me again, Jolyn Robichaux.  That was about 19--
Speaker 2: Ms. Hodges says the photo was marked 1989, does that sound correct?
Speaker 1: Does it, okay, yeah--
Speaker 2: [A portrait of Jolyn Robichaux, 1989.]
Story_ID: 19566

Speaker 2: [Jolyn Robichaux upon her graduation from Sumner High School, 1945.  From the collection of Jolyn Robichaux.]
Story_ID: 19568
Speaker 1: That's my brother, Billy [William Howard].  Oh, dear, let's see, I was about twelve, so that would make it 1940.  So, so this is probably 1942, '43 [1943], my brother.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He's the one that died two [sic., twelve] years ago.
Speaker 2: [Jolyn Robichaux's brother, William Howard, ca. 1942.  From the collection of Jolyn Robichaux.]
Story_ID: 19569
Speaker 1: I have difficulties telling what, what year this was.
Speaker 2: Well, identify the person.
Speaker 1: This is Margaret Love Howard, age sixty-five.
Speaker 2: So the year would have been approximately.
Speaker 1: Seventy-five, wait a minute.  It's fifty-five.  Wait a minute.  If she was seventy-five, and she was born in 1910, no, that would have made her, sixty-five, seventy-five, 1975.
Speaker 2: [A portrait of Jolyn Robichaux's mother, Margaret Love Howard, 1975.  From the collection of Jolyn Robichaux.]
Story_ID: 19570
