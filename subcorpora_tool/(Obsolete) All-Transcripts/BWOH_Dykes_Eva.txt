How your parents were born in the nearby area, or in the Washington region?
My father was born in Maryland, where the Catholics settled, as you know.
My mether was born also in Maryland, but she came to Washington at a very
early age, when she was a child. My grandparents moved from Maryland to
BIL It was in a section of Washington on the outskirts. The boundary

was about five blooks from where I lived. But the section where I was
born is now included in the Washington area.

Yes. Do you remember anything about your grandparents, either from your
memory or hearsay?

Well, I remember something that I ean appreciate very well now, since I
am a senior citizen. I tan remember passing him on the street and saying,
‘Hewdo, Hister Howard." He didn‘t know exactly who we were! Eeoause he
couldn‘t see too well.

Yes, his name was Howard, uh huh. John Howard.

Interestingr Now that's your paternal or your maternal grandfather?
Paternal.

I see. And he was born in the Haryland area?

He was born in Haryland.

Yes. Do you knew or remember your maternal grandmother er grandfather?
Yes, I remember her. She was born in Haryland also.

Yes. Well, then, you're were fortunate than I am. I do not know my grand-
parents...I know them, but they were deceased before I was born, and I*ve

never had the pleasure of a grandmother.

Yes. Well, I was fortunate enough to have the pleasure of both a grand—
father and a grandmother. For this I am grateful.

Yes. So you were born in Washington, or right on the outskirts of Washing-
ton, and you spent, obviously, your first years there.

did they? They went to school at five, like I did when I was five in

the eastern eelleges and universities.

Yes. Then from Dunbar, did you want to go away? So many students at
Dunbar are in preparation for an eastern college. Certainly in the past,
many of our outstanding Negroes were at Dunbar, and then went on to Harvard
or Williams or Yale...

Well, since many of the people in my family were graduates of Howard,
I wanted to go to Howard.

You did.

as if it was a school that was in our eity1r and at that time, I think, it
was one of the best black schools that we had.

Well, it was.

Although it didn‘t have the standing then it has now.

Yes, yes...

We did have what was known as ”oollege days,‘ when we would pretend that

not be very suitable now, but we would wear long dresses, and some of us

would pretend that we were mothers. I have a picture, I used to have a picture,

rather than college students, but that made it very interesting.

Eh, I see.
what was your speoial interest at Howard?
I didn't have a special interest; I took Latin four years, German four years,

English four years. And at that time I didn‘t know exactly what I was
going to be. And that happens in many eases; many students enter college

[oont.} not having determined, particularly, what they wanted to be in
life. I took mathematics. German, Latin, and English four years, the whole
time I was at Howard University.

Yes. But those were very, very basic subjeota.
Yes, they were basis.

You didn't jump around—-one semester this, the next semester something else.

Oh no, no.

I find students do so, and then when they finish, they have no ability in
any one field.

Well, that isn't strange. Many educators say that when students, some students,
enter college, they reaiiy don't know what they want to be in lire until

their senior year. I read an article similar to that in a magazine. That

we shouldn‘t be surprised if some students don't know before they go to

college exactly what they want to be. But by the time they finish college,

they have had a sampling of the various Subjects taught, and they make up

their minds after this, after they have finished, or near graduation time.

But sometimes we think that students make up their minds, or young people

make up their minds, when they are small. Some of them do. And then there

are others who are undecided, and college helps to settle their minds.

Tes. Which is finet in a way, if it does that. Somatimea it doesn't!
That‘s right.

Now, you did four years at Howard University, and received the haeealaureate
degree. Where does Radcliffe come in?

Well, my uncle wanted me to get my master*s degree. At the time Howard was

not aeoredited, and for that reason, the registrar wrote back and said I

would haye to attend Radcliffe so that they could determine what type of work

I would do. So my uncle decided to have me go there as an unelaSsified student,
and also get anotherseE.from a school that was aeeredited at that time.

That‘s what I did. I went to Radcliffe as an unclassified student, and after

I had been there one year, then I was classified as a senior. So I get my

n.s. from Radcliffe. Many people have asked me, Why did I get another

n.s. from Radcliffe? My uncle made the decision.

Yes. And that's fine. Then, you went right on for further study?

I taught one year.

Uh, you did?

I: a school in I‘Iashyille,I Tennessee, named Walden University. end I had a

very splendid English teacher at Howard by the name of David Houston, and

we should teaeh if we could. ﬁnd I did that. I was paid twenty~fiye

dollars a month with my expenses, at Walden University. It no longer exists,
but it was at that time situated in Nashvillo, Tennessee.

 

I see. Well you mentioned Houston. Is he the Houston I associate with
publications...

David Houston.

...as the scholar?

Tee, he was a soholar.

Very scholarly, yes. And I knew his daughterr
ﬂh,you did. He had two daughters, I think.
Ies. Well, that's fine-

Yes. He died, and his wife died also. She lived on T Street, Northwest,
in Washington.

That's the same Houston?
The same Houston.

Yes. How then, you went on... Did you take a master‘s, or go straight
through, after you were admitted, to the Fh.D.?

I went straight through. I received my master's, and then I decided to
work on...well, my uncle wanted me to work for a Ph.D., so I entered the
last stage, and worked on the Ph.D.

You mentioned= I think, you just told me once, that you had some scholar-
ships while you were at Radcliffe.

Yes, I had five seholarships; they were semester soholarships, and they were
very helpful. That, in addition to the fast that my uncle sent me money,
enabled me to finish suetessfully as far as finances were eoneerned. So I
didn‘t have to worry about how I was going to get my money. But my unole
made a deep saerifioe himself to send me through school.

That means, then, that your unole was a primary influence in your life...
In my life.

...espeeially in terms of your education. This is interesting, because
I'ye found in interviewing two or three other people that the father was

an important factor...

Yes, yes.

I suppose that may be because. if we're thinking of the early part of this
eentury, perhaps the men had gone on and had a oollege or university
education. Had this unole had that opportunity?

Yes. Yes, I had three uncles who graduated from Howard University. My
mother went to the university, but she had to stop because of illness.
But I did have two sisters; one attended the academy, and the other one
finished at Howard. She is now deoeased.

Now then, there is a background of members of your family being interested
in education. You never had anyone say, "Well, why are you still keeping your
head in the book? That won't do you any good.”

No, never. And although my father had separated from my mether...before
he was even married, he had received his degree from Howard University.
So I hows three unoles who studied there+ Two died before I was born.

Yes. Then Howard has played...Howar¢ and Radcliffe, and ﬂahwood haye together
played the major influences in your life.

In my life, yes.

How, your special interest at Radcliffe, after being aeeepred= registered,
and going on for graduate work, was in literature. And which literature,
primarily?

It was in English lit.1 but I took a number of eourses. At that time we had
to take eeurses foreign to English. I took Gothic, which is a dead language.
although I had had German at Howard, I also passed a course in German——an
examination, rather...

To qualify for the Ph.D.

To qualifyI yes. You have to have a reading knowledge of German and French.
Yes, I know, I had to...

Did you have to do that? .

Well, two foreign languages, and those are the ones I those, too.

Oh, I see. Well, I decided to take my oral examination in French, because
that was akin to Latin. and though I had had only one year of French,

in school, it being one of the romance languages, I passed it because of
my knowledge of Latin.

I read French quite rapidly... _I used to read it and not be aware that I
was reading a foreign language maybe until I was on page 25D, and then I'd

have to use the dictionary.

Oh. Yes.

HT: But I couldn‘t have done it in one year. But it was because of your Latin
baekground, I suppose. Did you find German difficult?

EED: No, it wasn‘t difficult, but I never liked it, particularly. But I
didn’t find it difficult as far as studying was eenoerned.

MT: I see. How long were you working for the Ph.D. degree? Do you remember
about how long?

EED: Oh, well, I would imagine about three or four years.

MI: That's good.

BED: I took one year off and went to visit the historical societies of Phila-
delphia--there was one in Philadelphia, the Historieal Seeiety of Pennsyl—
wants. I wicited n bistorioal sooiety in ooonettion with “ossathusetts;

that was in Boston. My teacher wanted me to go to North Carolina, but I
touldn't go, beeause I was black. So I couldn't attend the historical
society there. But on the other hand, I was able to get through without
meeting prejudice, which might damage me mentally. It didn't have any
effett upon me. I just decided to go on to some other place.

HT: Hell, that*s fine.

EBB: And my unole always told us that the people who were prejudiced were victims,
and not oppressors. Many of them were yietims of the type of education they
had received when they were younger. For that reason it made me have a
different outlook upon people who were prejudised. I didn't hate them;
my uncle had always taught me never to hate anybody, no matter how I was
treated. But he said that theysere the ones who were the unhappy persons;
not the yiotim, but the perpetrator.

HT: Yes. I think there's a great deal of truth in that. Now, obviously, you
had to write a dissertation for your Ph.D. degree. What was the subject
of that?

EBB? Pope's influence in America, from lIIG to 1350.
MT: on, alexander Pope.
EBB: Yes. His influence exerted itself for a long time, as you knowI after he

was dead. And that is true, in many oases, of the leading eheraeters in
literature. In faot, now many people are influenced by dead writers.

HT: Yes, that‘s true. More after their death than during their lifetime.
EBB? Yes, yes.
HT: And they often become famous after death.

EBB: After death, yes, they do. ﬁne interesting thing about Pope was that so
many people think of him as a elassieist, but he was a romanticist as far
as his attitude toward slavery, toward the oppressed, was eonoerned.

HT: Yes. And that carried oyerll too, did it not, to the working class in
England? Did he have ooneern for that group, like people in the
factories, and so on?

EED: I don't know about people in the factories, but I do recall the Indian;
he was interested particularly in the Indian. end in his works we do find
references to freedom. Yes, I think he mentions the slaves in one of his
works, just as williem Cowper did during that same period.

HT: You received your degree, I believe, in 1921--is that eorreot? The Ph.D.
degree?
EBD: I imagine so; I should remember the exact year... But there were three

of us to get the degree the same year.

HT: Yes, new when I first name to Washington, I heard much about that. Who
were those three?

EED: Sadie Hossell alexander, from the University of Pennsylvania, and Georgiana
Simpson, from University of Chicago.

MT: Yes. And I knew Dr. Simpson.

EBB: 0h, did you know her?

MT: She was here at Howard when I name. Or she was in Washington...
EBB: Were you there when she died? You were there at that time...
MT: Yes. I don't know whether she was still teaching when 1 same, but I did

go to her for some questions--not esaotly tutoring, because I had had

several years of German--but when some points would some up in German

that I didn't really understand, I would go to her home, which was in

southeast Washington down beyond the Library of Congress, somewhere in
that area. of eourse, you know how she died.

EEDI Yes, it was very sad. She fell asleep, as many of us do when we are
studying, and while she was asleep the gas came on, and she never
awakened.

HT: Of nourse,r that was the easy way to go...

EBB: Yes, a quiet way.

HT: It was a shock, though, to the Howard University community.

EBB: Well, we were very shocked.

MT: Beoause she wasn't decrepit, by any means.
EBB: No.

now.

EED: Hell, it impressed us. We were very muoh saddened by her death, when it
was reported to us.

MT: Yes. Now as I recall, when I name into Washington in 1922w—of oourse I
passed through.many times before, and knew any number of people here--
it was always a question: "What eolored woman received the Ph.D. first?”
Which one of the three of you?

EBB: Well, if you‘re going to say...there were three women who reoeiyed it.
MT: The same year?
EBB: Same year.

HT: end the same June, I suppose-—May or June. I imagine June was the commence"
went month then.

EBB: Yes, the question might oeeur as to the time of the graduation. Now I had
always thought that Sadie Alexander was the first one to receive here, as
far as the time was oonrerned, but I found it was Georgiana Simpson.

HT: Oh, is that so?

EBB: Yes, she received hers first. Her graduation was earlier. She got hers from
the University of Chicago; Sadie Mossell was next, University of Pennsylvania;
and Radcliffe was neat.

HT: But you finished your work.

EBB: I just merely happened to qualify first, and some of the teachers at Dunbar
were so gratified, or so pleased, that they said that I was the first one
to reoeiye the degree. But aotually all three of as received it the same

graduation year.

HT: I‘m glad that you have straightened the record for this history. Eeeause
I've heard so many oouflieting statements.

EED: 1 really happened to qualify for it first; that was the only thing.

HT: Yes. And it doesn't seem to make a great deal of difference, because you
received it...

EBB: Ne, three people received it in the same year, that‘s right.

HT: Yes. And probably the same month.

BED: I think the same... No, I think we graduated from Radcliffe last, I
think our graduation day was later. I think so. I won't call the names,
but many of the people under whom I worked were so pleased, and they didn't
know that these other people were going to come up, and that’s how that
tumor started. I may say that I was the first one to get the Ph.D. degree
in English. So you may stop there.

HT: end not too many get it in English today, I can tell you that.
EED: Is that so?

MT: I know any numher who attempted to get it in English, and they never did...
from Harvard and Radcliffe. Now, you were the first woman, then, of our
race to finish with a Ph.D. from Radcliffe. There‘s no question about
that. Well, that to me clears the record.

EBB: Yes.

HT: Before we were interrupted by the telephone, you were just cumpleting the
statement of your Ph.D. dissertation subject on Pope, Alexander Pope.
The degree was actually in what phase of English? Would that be English
literature?

EBB: It was English literature, hetause it had to do with Alexander Pope, who
was one of the prominent characters in the area of olassieism.

HT: Yes. But the diploma states that?
BED: No, the diploma merely states "English Philology.”

MT: Philology? Philology to me has a slightly different meaning from English
literature as such.

EBB: Yes, it does. Probably because I did take a course in the theories of
language. I studied Gothio. This was a course that was seldom taught at
that particular time, but it was taught at Harvard. The Haryard teacher
tame over and taught the Radeliffe students in Gothic.

1“T: old English? Anglo-Saxon, too, Beowulf, and so on?

EED: Yes, yes. Yea, I read that in the original AngIo—Saxon, at Radcliffe.
Probably that's the reason, I don‘t know... But we did have to do with two
laws, or one law, particularly, governing languages, known as Grimm‘s Law.

MT: Oh. yes. Did you ever study anywhere other than Howard or Radcliffe?

EBB: I attended the Linguistic Institute, the summer session, at the University

of Indiana, and I was sent there as a representative of Uakwood College.
Than I also attended New York University as an auditor. The course I took

EBB: (eont.) there was a course in education. I received no credit for that.
Then I did attend, also, a sohool of theology held by the Seyenth-day
Adventists in Tahoma Park.

HT: That was after you finished your Ph.D., or in between?
EBB: After I finished my Ph.D.

MT: Yes. How, obviously, we must all liye. Did you receive a teething position
with that Ph.D? At that time, it was phenomenal for Negroes to have a Ph.D.,
especially in English. Not many get it today, in English.

EED: Is that so?
MT: not many.

EBB: Hell, I was abie, whiie i was at Radeiifie, to obtain five sehoiarships
each semester, and those scholarships, with the aid of my unole, enabled
me to finish. Successfully, as far as finances are conterned.

MT: Yes. But I'm talking about after, getting a position.

BED: well, I had a teacher by the name of David Houston when I was a student at
Dunbar High Sehool, and he always told us to take the first position
available, because people who hire teachers want experience rather than
knowledge; in fast, experience counted almost as mush as a knowledge of
the subject. So in aeeordanee with Dr. Houston‘s views, I taught sohool
for one year at walden University in Nashville, Tennessee. end that no
longer exists. Then after that, I went on and obtained my graduate
degrees. When I first graduated from Howard, I did attend Walden University,
which at that time was a feeding school for Meharry Medical School. That
no longer exists.

HT: Right. Then after that teaching experience, what was your next? I mean
with the Ph.D., you must have been in demand.

EBB: Well, I was called to Howard University to teeth by Mordecai Johnson. Then
I was nailed to Oakwood College to teaoh. end while I was at Oakwood Col-
lege, I taught part time at e a M University, a state sohool.

HT: You were at Howard from what years to what years? I remember you at Howard.

Yes. And then from Howard—-I left Howard in 1929...

You went there in 1929...

Yes, and I left there in 19st, and I came to Oakwood to teach.
Yes. Eeeause I name to Howard at ‘s2 and you were there.
Yes, yes.

And we knew each other on the campus, and all.

Well, I was called by the president of Oakwood College to come there and
teaeh in the English department.

Yes. Now what subjects did you teach at Howard, or in what field? I
wouldn‘t say aTT the subjects...

Well, all of them in the field of English.

What soeeial ones, for example?

 

American lit., English lit., various phases of English lit. All of them
were in the upper classes. I didn't teaeh any of the freshman courses at
all until I name to Dakwood. I did teach a course in English eomposition,
too.

I thought so.

Yes. I taught composition. English literature, and American lit. while I
was at Howard.

Do you remember any of your studEnts from Howard who have become distinguished
in one way or another? Uh, you told me you had a list of those. ya“

think you will find them later? Not only at Howard, but other places that

you have taught, and the students of...

Yes. Some of these students I taught in Dunbar High School. At that
time it was known as H Street High Sohool, ans many of them have become
famous. I taught Hasthe,who beeame a governor of the Virgin Islands.

1 also taught Charles Drew, who discovered...

end a dormitory for men is named for him at Howard. He did so much on
blood plasma.

Yes, blood plasma. He was one of my students. I taught Cortes Peters, who
became a champion in typewriting across the United States.

Yes. And there were others, too?
and there were several others.

Yes. Dunbar has such a famous name for its graduates, in going on to the
eastern colleges, and then going on and on and on, in the professions.

EBB: Yes, yes.

 

MT: Yes. How, you would like to continue with what other aspect of your
life, besides the teaehing? Because I know that there must be many other
things.

EED: You probably may want to know about some of the publications.
HT: Dh, definitely.

EED: Hell, I wrote an article for Crusader. It was one of the earliest articles
that I wrote. That magazine is no longer in existence, but it was published
in New York City. a: the present time, I am writing articles for the
Message magazine, How the magazine, the Message magazine, had a "Council
Corner" when I first wrote for that. Then I also wrote a series of articles
called ”Morning Meditations,” which consisted of writing a composition or a
paragrayh on telLaiu oerses in the bible. then, i also am writing new “This
Morning with God," which consists of a number of articles dealing with the
verses in the Bible on yarious topies. And that has been changed now to
"tour Bible Speaks." That is one of the current columns in the Hessage
magazine. I also wrote an article for the Youth Instructor, entitled
”Diadems and Fagots," which was later followed by "a Light Beautiful,"
concerning Mother Isabel Cunningham, who was considered as a mother by all
the students here at ﬂakwood College.

MT: Was she here at Dakwood?

EBB: She was at Dakwnod Collage, and I may say that she was the first dean of
men at Dakwood College.

MT: She was a dean of men?
EBB: In the old days, she was a dean of men.
”T: I wonder if there are any others in the reeords of other eolleges?

EED: I've never heard of it, but probably you will find somebody if you search
hard enough. Probably you will find some. Then some of my artielee have
appeared in the Negro History Bulletin; I reviewed Marian Anderson*s auto—
biography, which was called Ey_Lord, What a_Horning——you will probably
remember that. Then I wrote also for The Journal of Negro History an artiele
on Bryant and his poetry, an article dealing with the fiftieth anniversary
number. Dr. Carter Woodson was living at that time. I‘m still writing a
column for the Message magazine. end then, I'm one of the eoeditors. And
that is under the title "Your Bible Speaks." I wrote at the same time articles
for The Reviewing Herald. The first one was ealled, ”The women of the Bible
as Good and Bad Counselors." I also wrote an article eslled "The
Investiture Supreme," and that was based on the investiture of Charles of
England, the son of...

 

HT: Queen Elizabeth?

RED: Queen Elizabeth.

HT: Uh, yes. I remember.

 

EED: Well, I eompared his investiture with the investiture that Christians have
to deal with when they think they will become the sons Promoted to a higher
area of Christ. I made the comparison.

HI: Yes. Now that was a oeremony that was performed when he was entitled
to tarry the title the Prince of wales. That inyestiture?

EED: Yes. When he was first inyested.

HT: I watched that on television. Generally I don't watch television in the
morning, because I'm writing. But I watched that, and typed. It was yery,
wary interestingly presented, in contrast to the old investitures, beeause
it had to be economically done.

EBB: Ies. well, that was based upon his betoming...he was the Crown Prince, I
think, of England at that time. Then I have written some books, The_hegro
in English Romantic Thought, which was published by Hareourt Erase a company.
I also contributed to a series. Lorenzo Turner, who was a former teacher at
Howard University; Letitia Cromwell, who was the head of the English separt—
ment in the public school system; and I were the eoeditors, and that was
entitled Readings for Negro Schools and Colleges. That was published by the
Associated Publishers of Washington,D.C. Carter woodson was at the head of
that company. Then I participated in the preparation of a manual for a be-
ginning teacher of linguistics in a secondary school. At this time, I
was in a class at Indiana University under the direction of Gwen Thomas, who
was the author. He had his students do work in linguistics, and those
works he embodied in his book. I also participated with Florence Winslow,
who was a teacher at Gakwood College, and she is still teaching, and we put
together a manual of English. It was mimeographed, it was never printed.
That deals with articles that I hays printed and published.

HT: What is this? Those are some of your...

EBB

Chureh and secular experiences. Would you like to hear about those?

HT: Uh, ?ES- Dhyiously. “a want anything that you have done in your lifetime
that you care to reveal. We're not asking for secrets.

EBB: Hell, I hope all of them would be available to the publie eye. I was
baptized as a seyenth-day Adventist in washington,Itc, I may say that my
uncle was one of the first black Adventists in Washington,D._C1 He became
an anwentiet before I was born, in the last eentury. end I didn't knew
until I was at the funeral and George took, Dean Cook of Howard University,
oame down—-Dean Cook was head of the Commercial College--and I did not know
until then that he had an a.s. and a master's degree from Howard University.
I knew he had received his medical degree, but when George Cask gave a
eulogy over his body, I found out then that he had his master‘s degree and
A.E. from Howard back then in the seventies. when the sohool first started.
So that was interesting for me.

How is that the same unole who was anxious for you to go to Radcliffe5 and
helped you while you were there, or another unole?

It‘s the same unole. He was interested in my education, and he was responsible
for my attending school.

He played then a major influenos...
...in all of my education.
...in your life, more than, perhaps, any other person?

Yes, he did. He was the one.

That's interesting. end this is a man... By the way, I didn't ask you
earlier, when we were disoussing your early years, when you said you at-
tended thzai Iniversity, and T was a liltlw shocked, you hnow, 3; If you

just went in at five years of age. Did you have brothers and sisters?

My sister attended Howard University, and she graduated from the Commercial
School over which Dean Cook, George Cook, presided. But she died.

Early?
Soon after her graduation.
Well, did you have any brothers?

I understand there was a brother born before I was born, but I never met him.
He died.

ﬂh. That‘s all, then. In your early years, it was just the sister--that is,
in your early school years.

Three uneles graduated before I was born.

Yes. Thege were uncles. And one in particular...

Dr. James Howard-

Dr. James Howard took a particular interest in your education.

That is correct.

and you feel, perhaps, without him you may not be what you have become?
Yes.

That's interesting, the influence. Two ladies I have interviewed, the
father has been the predominant influenoe in their edueation. In fact,

three of them have said the same thing. Hrs. Susie W. Jones; her sister,
Frances Hilliams; and Lena Edwards...

your unole. Perhaps heoause men, in the past century and the early part
of this eentury, were the ones who were getting the higher edueation.

Is that not so?

Probably so, I am sure. So my unole thought it would be a good thing for me
to go to eollege and get a higher education. He was responsible entirely
for all of my education.

[break in interview]

I actually interrupted the interview by mentioning or asking if your unole

was the dominant figure in your life, in forwarding your education and entourag-
ing you. i think you onto muﬂtiunEd LU me that was betause your mother and
father were separated and then divorced early in your life. Therefore, you

have said that you never felt the trauma of separated parents. Is that

true?

Yes, that is true. I never felt that experience, because my father, my
stepfather, and my uncle, all of them, were good friends. My stepfather
taught at Hiehlestown, Maryland. Then he came to Washington and obtained

a position in the government. I may say that he roamed with my uncle for
many years. And since my uncle was giying us an edueation...my father and

my unole were good friends, and since my father was interested in us, he would
often visit us when we were living with our stepfather. But I may say that
my stepfather, my uncle, my father, and my mother were all good friends.

For that reason, I newer experienced the trauma that so many ehildren do
experience beoause they happen to be with divorced parents. My mother and my
father, although divorced, were friendly. So I think I have a unique en-
perienoe in that respect.

Hell, it didn't poison or damage your life, your outlook, and your eareer?
No, it did not.

Fine. Now I think you were about to go into your church and secular experi-
ences, which are many, I‘m sure.

well, I was baptized and joined the Emphasis Seyenth-day sdyentist Chureh

in washington, D.G. While there, I was superintendent of the senior, junior,
and primary divisions. I was also the sabbath sohool pianist. I also heeame
the church organist. I was director of the church choir for many years.

I was also missionary volunteer leader, a member of the ohuroh board, and

a member of the school board. For some time, I was also the church treasurer.
Those are some of the religious experiences at Emphasis Church in Washington,
D.C.

May I interrupt? About this musin. While you were studying at HowardII
from the time you were five years old, and then going on to Radcliffe,
did you have music lessons in between?

 

Yes, and at that time it cost twenty—fiye seats a lesson. There were
two sisters there, but my meals teacher was a very famous teacher at that
time, ﬂies Jennie Williamson.

Uh, I've heard of her. You mean in Washington.

In washington,D.G. She was my first teacher. end that was what my uncle
paid, twenty-fiye tents a lesson.

end that was again the same unole, encouraging you in musie.

Yes.

And then you could play the piano and you eould also play the organ?

I took lessons--I must have been at a very young age-—to play the piano.
when I was six or seven years old my mother tells me about this experience...
I know I did play for a Baptist church on Sherman eyenue, in washington, and
it was their oustom to hays marshes. This is what we used to have at the
sehool, down here at Gakwood college. my mother said that while I was play—
ing the organ, I jumped up off the organ and began marching with the people,
and left nobody at the organ. I don't remember that experience, hot she
often tells me about that.

But you wanted to marth,I you wanted to be a part of the affair.

I wanted to march.

Then you directed the choir.

Yes, I directed the choir at that same ehureh.

So naturally you had to know something about...

Directing?

Choral music, as well as piano and organ, or you just got up and directed?
Well, they asked me to direct the ehoir.

You just directed it.

Yes. They asked me to tone there and play, and I also helped them with
the choir, at an early age.

That kept you out of mischief.

It did, it did. Although I was a mischievous ohild.

HT: In what way? What were some of the things you‘d do?

EED: Well at that time, when my unole first same to Washington, he bought a
place about five blocks from what was known as the boundary.

MT: eh, yes.

EBB: The boundary, at that time, was Is Florida eyenue. Well, we liyed about
six blocks from the boundary. We were not given any gaslight. At that
time the houses had had gas, who were in the boundary of washington, but
since we were outside the boundary, we had to have oil lamps. I remember
we used to make little twisters--we oalled then lamplighters--to put into
the lights. Well, one day my unole was at work, nobody was at home, so my
sister and I said, "Let‘s light a lamp." So we got one of these lamp twisters
that were made out of paper, lighted the lamp and then put it outside on the
roof of the front porch. While it was there, the wind began blowing, and
the ILa;n:.:.: -.-....-_ gin. .Eu' we wt-uL out and But the attention of soLllewoe or. the
street, and the man came in and put the lamp out. We thought the house was
going to eateh fire. So after that time I never touehed a lamp outside of
the house. But that was an interesting experience for all of us. When
my uncle name home, he didn't rebuke us at all, but he told us not to do that,
that it was very dangerous. end I may say that that did me more good than
a whipping. He told us why we had made the mistake. Probably if he had
whipped us and never told us exactly why, I might have been more disturbed
than I was. But we apologised. I'll never forget that experience,

 

HT: Is that the only naughty thing you ever did?

EBB: Oh, as children we were very mischievous. I imagine we did many, many
things. I know that at one time, some men were building a fence around
our yard. My uncle's property took up half the hlook. And some ef the men
left a bottle there. We didn‘t know what was in the bottle, so we sipped
the bottle and we found out it was whiskey. So that was the only time that
we ever interfered like that with other people‘s business. That's the
only time I‘ve ever tasted whiskey in my life. too, but I didn't heeome drunk
because I didn't have enough of it.

HT: Did you ever do any naughty things in school, or were you always the teacher's
yet? You always were perfect.

EBB: ohI I'm sure I wasn‘t perfect, I know I liked to talk. I was at Dunbar
High School once, and I was often aeeused of doing what I did not do.
There was a very beautiful girl there—wI can't think of her name, but she and
my sister were good friends. My teaoher was Parker Bailey, who was well
known at that time, at H Street High School, and my sister was called upon
to talk. I sat behind my sister. When my sister got up to talkn—we had to
stand then; you didn't sit in your seats and talk to the teaeher--Parker
Bailey asked my sister a question. Well, this dear friend of ours answered
the question. But the teacher thought I was the one, and he rebuked me before
the whole class. But I newer said that it was my friend who assisted my
sister. But I took the abuse and said nothing. That time I really wasn't
the one, it was this friend of mine who tried to help my sister. And
children still do that, I imagine. I don't know whether they do it now or
not, but they...

But I stood there and he rebuked me before the whole close. and he told me
I was dishonest. I felt like trying, and I cry yery easily, but I didn't
say ne'er a word. But I think all children are mischieyous at times.

Yes. well, they wouldn't be normal it they weren‘t.
They wouldn't be normal if they weren't.

Yes. How you were eontinuing...I interrupted about the music in church,
playing the organ, and directing the choir, et eetera.

At the Sherman awenue Baptist Church in Washington,D.C. I was the organist.
at that time, you had those old-fashioned organs, you know, where you pedal
the feet. I was too short to use those nedals, so the minister of the church
tied the pedals bath-the lowers, I think are hellows——where you increase

the music?

Yes.

And kept them tied, and that was the worst thing he could have done to an
organ, but I didn't know it at that time. But I could barely reach the
pedals, and I used to pedal, and the music came out at the same dynamic all
the time because I didn‘t use those bellows to make it soft or to make it
loud. I was also organist at the Asbury Methodist Church in washington,
D.Gu and director of the choir.

And that still exists, that church.

It still exists there. Then the Oakwood College church and school ewe
perienees from lgaﬁ to 1963, I'll giwe you those if you want me to.

Yes, certainly.

I was the Home Missionary Society leader, director of the church choir, and

a sponsor of the Oakwood College chapter of the SEVEnthTﬂEF Adventist
Temperance Society. I was also director of the camp meeting choirs for various
oonferenoes of eduentists. We have about five regional conferences, and I
was the director of the their for the South Atlantis Conference of Eeyenth-
day adyentists, for the Northeastern Conference of Seventh—day Adventists,
which takes place in New York, and I was the director of the Seventh-day
Adventist choir for the Allegheny Conference, which had its headquarters

near Philadelphia. Then I lectured on Christian education and youth problems
at the various regional conferences. While I was direotor of the choir,

I was asked if I would give a lecture on Christian education, and I die that.
I was director of the Oakwood College Choir when I tame back here. I was
director of the college oratorio society, when Hande1*s Messiah was presented
for the first time in the city of Huntsville. The date of presentation was
during the Christmas holidays, in 19a5. I have a picture of that in a manual
that was put out by Dr. Heryin Warren, who at present is the dean of the
College of Liberal Arts at Howard. I was director of the Faculty women's

(eont.} Chorus at Oakwood, a sponsor of the Delta Sigma Club of women
students,r a sponsor for the activities of various senior classesn-as you know,
each senior class has a regular sponsor, and 1 was sponsor for many of

those. Then from IEID to the present time, I have been a deaconess at

the Oakwood College Church, a pianist for the sabbath school--we usually

have about four or five different pianists, and we will take turns on

various sabbaths——and I also am an associate of lay activities, leader

and an interest coordinator of church activities.

What does the last position imply?

You are supposed to take the activities, the missionary activities of the
warieus ETDUPEs by faculty members and also by students, and then you try

to see if you can't find out the relationship between these aotiyities so
that there would be no duplication. Then you are responsible for sending

the material to one of our church trauers:I and that‘s what I'm supposed to

do. I may say that this year, that duty has boon nesienmﬂ ya me as hates ﬁne
of the coworkers, leaders of the missionary activity. So it is no longer
called an interest coordinator, but the work will be the same.

How I notice you haye some memberships in learned and professional societies.
oh, I am a member of a Phi Beta Kappa, the Iota chapter. I didn't become
a member of the Phi Beta chapter while I was at Radcliffe, getting my

s.a., but after I started to work on my master's degree and my Ph.D. de-
gree, I was admitted as a member of the Iota chapter.

end that is in Cambridge.

In Cambridge, Massachusetts, yes.

Yes. I was admitted, too, there.

0h, is that so?

Yes, when I finished the Ph.D. I attended Western Michigan University, and

they did not have in the 1920s these honor societies. But according to
my reeord there, an n.a. and what I did at Radcliffe, I would have quali—

fied.

Uh, they just didn‘t have it.

Therefore they took me in at Radcliffe...

Eh, I see.

And it was a surprise something. I only knew about it the day before my
commencement. ﬁnd someone said, "You're supposed to go to such—and—such a
hotel, tonight, for initiation in Phi Beta Kappa.” end all my friends in

washington said, "Herse, Harte Tate was more interested in the Phi Beta
Kappa than she was in her Ph.D. degree."

Well, I never received mine until I had graduated.

They told me that I had been appointed as a member of the Iota chapter.
But I wasn't a member while I was there at school.

You were there in 1921, and mine was in 19a1,twenty years later,and they
must have adopted that policy in between, of people who would have
qualified for Phi beta Kappa, you see.

Well, I thought maybe I was the only one. But I was glad to...

ho, mine came up the same way.

afterwards, is that so.

But I guess they were happy to have Phi Beta Kappa members in that chapter,
and people Lhey would make. Since they had a rcuord that qualified them

for it. I didn‘t know that you were, either, till this came up.

Well, I may say that when I was at Howard, Howard didn‘t have any, till
later.

No. We had it only recently.

But Dr. slain Loeke wrote a letter to me and said he wanted to initiate
this chapter at Howard University...

That‘s right.

and so I answered his letter, and this chapter was initiated at Howard.

It came up later, or while you were there?

while I was there he wrote the letter to me.

He is responsible, more than any other person, for pushing our membership.
Well, we did get it. end if you had been there when the chapter was made,

you would haye been the founding member of that chapter, beeause you re-
mained in another chapter, but automatically you would be in our Gamma

chapter.
Yes.
He worked assiduously to get that. end it came before he died. wow this

year—-oh, 1:111 he in 'IB, this academic year——we are celebrating our twenty—
fifth anniversary of Gamma chapter.

Uh, is that so?

And we‘re working on the program now. I've been historian of that chapter.

letter from him, thanking me for what I did to set the D.C. Association

to invite the colored members of Phi Beta Kappa who were in washington; there
were 23, even before we got our chapter. Some of the people you hays
mentioned here, others, like B. Beatrix Scott, and two of the Cromwells...

New England universities.

eh, I see.

And I have it, alain Locke's. It was typed, but with his signature, and
of course they would like that very much. Well, I'll take that back...

Well, I*ll give you that letter. I found it, I think, after Mr. Battle came
down here.

oh, this colleetion,the Hoorland-Spingarn Collection, is the finest in the
world.

That's what I understand.

Yes. end I was so happy that I told them to get in touch with you. You
told me you were sorting out your papers and throwing things away, and I

said, "Don*t throw them away! Save everything!”

but I kept them all these years.

of University Professors. You might be interested in knowing the alumni
associations to which I belong: Radcliffe College alumni Association;

I‘m an assooiate member of the Oakwood College Alumni assooiation. I may
say that I'm not a graduate of Dakwood College, but the teachers here

enjoy associate membership, because they do hays an interest in the college.

These awards and honors, yes, we‘re interested...

Well, I have received the following, by unanimous vote of the Howard Uniyersity
faculty, selected as the best a11—around teacher of the faculty. I didn't
know that until Dr. Mordecai Johnson told me that. By unanimous vote of the
Howard University alumni, I was the recipient of the Alumni Award for the
highest grade-ooint average attained during undergraduate years. I am also

the recipient of a scholarship for five consecutive semesters at Radcliffe
College. That was monetary. I am the recipient of an award from the Daniel
Payne College for distinguished teaching, and a recipient of the annual

Alumni award conferred by the trustees of Howard University for distinguished
postgraduate achievement in education, on Saturday, March 2, 19t5.

I remember that.

You do?

Yes. I was there at Howard.

Is that so? oh, yes. The recipient of a plaque from the Chicago chapter of

the ﬂakwood College alumni Association for distinguished teaching, the
recipient of an award from the American association of University Women,

hale, a former president of Oakwood, the naming of the Dakwood College
library as the Eye E. Dykes Librarynwl'm responsible to him for that.

end I understand that library is completed. I thought it was under con-
struction.

You haven‘t visited it yet, have you? I'll have to take you there before
you leave.

nus it*s open now?

YES. it's open now. You were talking by telephone to Miss Lewis and to
Miss Clara Rook earlier today.

oh, yes. Tour archives are there, some of the materials that you‘ve ore-
sented. '

Yes. Host of the material is there. I was one of two guest of honor speakers
at the shatter meeting of the National Association of Black Professional
Women in Higher Education, at wingate, Racine, Wisconsin, in April, lQIh.
There were three of us who were honored: Dr. Sadie Alexander, who was re-
presented by her daughter. Dr. Simpson was dead. But I was the only one

who could attend. Dr. alexander was ill at that time,but her daughter
represented her.

Now, I thought that you represented either university people, or your
church, at a conference in Geneya--am I wrong?

Oh, yes, I was sent there as a delegate from the general conference of
Seventh—day Adventists, with all expenses paid, as one of the guests.

And when was that?
That was about two years ago.

I think Hay Skinner told me about it. Now, tell me something about that
trip.

Well, that trip was very, very, very interesting. I went with the president
and his wife, and also four or fiye of the teachers here. All of us made
the trio together. and it was very interesting to stay at the...it was one
of the Hilton hotels, scattered throughout the world.

Yes. In Geneva.

In Geneva. and it was wary interesting there. While there, you might be
interested to know that I did receive an award, with another teacher from
Dakwood College, Dr. Natelha Eurrell. She doesn't teach now, she's retired,
and living in Michigan at the present moment. But it seemed as if there were
as many people there from America as there were people from Europe. It was a

the conference in some of my papers. Sometime I‘ll let you read those--
I know you don't have time to look at them now. But it was really an
interesting esperienee+

hid you fly or go by ship?

I flew.

That's the expensiye way.

We had to go to New York. Well, the expenses were all paid.
I know, but I mean, flying is more expensive because...

Yes, it is. But it's shorter.

You had to go to New York to oateh the flight, the transatlantie flight.
You said you went to New York.

Yes, we went from here to Atlanta, to get the Delta. Then from there, we had
to go to New York. From the same airport, from New York, we flew over to
Geneyay Switzerland.

Yes. I spent some time there. I lived there for three different summers.
One summer I was at Professor Alfred Eimmern's school of international
relations. That was my first summer there, and then I made friends...

It was where, did you say?

In Geneva. The Geneva School of International Studies, yes.

Can you speak the langauge?

Well, French, German, and Italian. I don't speak Italian, but of course,
they have three languages there. In Geneva. French is the basic language
and German, and Bale or Easel is German and French, and of course over in

Enrich, it's Italian and German. But the Swiss have to learn those three
languages, and then for good measure they learn English for business.

Uh. [laughter]
For making money.
I see.

But it's a beautiful country, and they wary, of course, which seotiou

EED: No, these are some of the eyents that I was connected with. See, I retired
in '63, and went to Gordonyille, Virginia. Then I name back here in ‘20.
and these are some of the...

NT: Some of the events while you were away?

EBD: No, while I was here. You see, this was printed. I had forgotten, I didn‘t

mention it, but I did tell you I was director of the ehoir, but I didn't
mention Handel's Hessiah.

HT: And did you help direct that?

END: Yes, yes. In 19d5, according to this calendar, I was the head of the
Dakwood College Oratorio Society, and we presented Handel's Messiah, during
the Christmas season, in 19d5.

HI: end I see, "Under the direction or Dr. Eva b. Dykes." end that was the
first time that the.hessiah...

END: ...it had ever been presented here, in huntsyille.
NT: Isn't that interesting. Did the city come to the gown?
EBB: Yes, I had a soprano--the soprano that I wanted was one of the workers

here, and she had to leave. he then I went down to Huntsville, and some-
body introduced me to one of the musical members of the society there, and
she said that she would very gladly come here. So she took the part of the
eontralto. end then we were assisted by one of the musicians, who is living
nowII Mr- Drexel. He's a member of the Huntsville Symphony Orchestra. He
was very kind. He would always some out here various times to help us with
our concerts and to do anything we wanted, and he would bring musicians when
we had recitals. He is a very, very splendid man. He was born here in
Huntsville, alabama.

HT: Yes. and that gives spirit and enthusiasm to both sides, I think.
EBD: It does.
NT: So the town does come to the gown here, occasionally?

EBB: Yes, yes. He had a new director here about three years ago——he‘s not
here nowhsbut he was from Juilliard, and now hE's teaching at one of the
schools in Hassaohusetts. He had the whole symphony orchestra to some out
here, and present the Messiah. Part of it, you know; it's too long to be
presented as a whole. But our stage wasn't able to hold all the musicians
who name. So there is quite a deal of rapport between Huntsyille and Dak-
wood College.

NT: That's good.
END: It‘s been like that ever since I've been here, and I same here in ‘ds.
MT: end it is Alabama.

EBB: Both alabama, Alabama.

MT: of course, I will probably take a little sightseeing tour tomorrow, but
coming in last night, I eould see, it seems to be a very clean town. The
streets and highways and so on are well taken care of. end of course the
air last night was so fresh; it wasn't brisk and cold, but it was fresh.
I souldn‘t find any smudge and sent and so on...pollution.

EED: Db, you know, washington has changed considerably. I was there last sums
met, and I didn't know parts of the city because of all these changes.

NT: Quite.

EED: And when H Street High School, when Dunbar High School was pointed out to
me, I scarcely recognized the plane where I used to attend sehool, because
of the various changes there.

HT: Yes, yes. Now, does that conclude what you wanted to contribute today?
That's the calendar of ‘a5, and 'as, and so on. Here's something you
had for '53.

EBD: February...the photograph and the date, and words, 195D to '59, the Southern
Association of Colleges and Sehools granted Dakwood College initial ac"
creditation in lﬁﬁﬂ, and I was the member of that oollege which received
accreditation, final accreditation, in 1958. I was working down here then.
And I retired, as I told you before, in '58. I should haye retired earlier,
according to my age, but I had been working, and then they recalled me,

Dr. Hale asked me to come back to help out.

HT: That is, you retired, and you came back to Virginia to live for a while.

EBD: I went to, yes, Virginia, and I stayed there for two years.

HT: Beoause I remember that, two years. end were set up in housekeeping?
EED: Yes.
HT: end then you were...

Ebb: and there was a telephone call from Dr. Hale to some back.

HT: And they provided you with this lovely cottage, made arrangements for you
to live here?

EBB: Yes, when I first came, when I came back.
HT: and opposite the campus. And you're here, and they want you to stay.

EBB: After I came back I worked for a number of times, you might say, as a
tutor, helping. students when I did teach. Then I would help students who
could not get their courses in the regular classes, well, then I would help
them, individually. So that thEy would get credit for graduation, Many of
them were the senior members who weren't able to get the courses that they
wanted in their schedule. I think now there is maybe a better manipulation

Ebb: {eont.} of the courses, so that students won't have to be in private classes.
I know once or twice I had only one student who needed a certain course, so
she was sant to me, but I raceiwed the same, proportionately, amount of
money that I would have, you see. I didn't receive the money for teaching
four or five subjects, as I would have. But I didn‘t mind that, I was able
to help the school in that way.

MT: Yes. Do you hays any feelings about retirement? You are a very wise per—
son, and can give advice to other people. Have you any advice you would want
to give? of course, I'm retired, and I have my own opinions, and I know
what I'm doing, but if someone has not yet retired, what kind of advice
might you give them?

EBB: I would say, enjoy your work no matter what it is, if you can. There's
so much to do—-so many things that I want to do now and am unable to dor—
sinne I'm not teaohins. I'm busy here with ohuroh work, and with other
work, but I think when you retire, if you can find something to do, you
won‘t feel as if your abilities have gone to waste. I think that if people
would have the right attitude toward retirement, they wouldn't mind retiring.

HT: And you‘re not attually retired in the sense of sitting down in the rocking
chair.

Ebb: No. If you enjoy your work and enjoy what you are doing for work's sake,
and I have a whole list of things that I want to do, and I never will be
able to do them because I won't live so long.

MT: Well, I‘m in the same way about manuscripts that I would like, some to
finish and others to start, and I know that there aren't enough years, and
I have three or four in preparation, in addition to other projects. I
don‘t haye as many, perhaps, civic projects as you have, but I here those
connected with universities. Have you felt that your color or your sex
prevented you from doing what you wanted to do in life?

EBB: Well, when I was working on my doctorate, I had to consult some of the
historical societies of the various states, and my profegsﬂr at Radcliffe
wrote to some historical society in North Carolina. He was told I couldn't
come, because I was black. EUt Huntsville has always been very charitable.
You can go anywhere here. When I first came down here, you weren‘t per-
mitted in many of these Placaa- But tau can so anywhere in Huntsville
now, and he accepted.

HT: end it‘s alabama.

EBB: It's Alabama. [both laugh, imitating the accent.] huntsyille is very
liberal. In fact, it's always been liberal to a certain extent, but now
it is more liberal than it ever was. You can do anything you want to here.

HT: Do you think your sex has had anything to do with your status in various
places? Do you think if you'd been a man, with a Harvard degree, you
might have had higher salary at Howard Uniyersity?

EED: Well, I didn't know much about salaries then, I didn't have that in mind.
and I do know that you are presented with a scale now here at oakwood.
The associate professor would get from maybe fifty to sixty dollars a month,
but the woman would be down nearer the fifty than up by the sixty, you

| see. So I think that that situation obtains in all schools and all de—
nominations.

HT: I know it has at Howard University. I've made a study of the status of
women at Howard University...

EBD: oh, you have?

HT: end it was so yieious—yhordeeai Johnson asked me to do it—-that he was
shocked, I mean statistically. But sometimes they wouldn‘t eyen give me
the figures I needed. But even those that I got...and some changes were

' made as a palliative. and then at different times some deans have tried
to be a little more just, but men are always at the top, even Lilougn they
may have fewer degrees, fewer publications, less trayel and so on than a
' woman. I‘ve been discriminated against all my life.

EED: Hell, I think that obtains in most situations. That aoeounts for the
women's lib now, and the efforts of many other groups of women. But I have
I tried to be satisfied, because my main interest 13hr: mﬂneyl I’ve tried
I to be pleased, I mean, but as far as being rebellious or bitter because of
the discrimination that is made between men and women... I know once there
i was a promotion here, and the men got a promotion--this was many, many years
ago, and Elder Peterson, who was president of the school at that time, knew
| about this promotion. one of the men teachers here, by the name of Sumpter,
said to me, ”oh, Niss Dykes, did you get your promotion?" end I said, "What
! promotion?" end he said, "Well, YOU has“: all the teachers were promoted."
| I said, "Well, I didn't Eat an? Prﬂmﬂtieﬂa" So when I saw President Peterson:
I said to him, “President Peterson, I understand that some of the heahherﬁ
got a promotion. end I didn't get one." and I was just like a ehild,
curious, you know, why I didn't. end he said to me in his inimitable way,
with his hands stretched out wide--I can see him now, standing on the steps
i of Moran Halls—"Nell, you are a woman. That‘s why YD“ didn't get it.”
end he was one of my dear friends. I said, "President Peterson, if I go over
here to the store and want to buy a loaf of bread, do I get a reduction be-
cause I am a woman? If I want to go downtown and buy clothes, do I get a
reduction because I am a woman?” So that has esisted all down through the
ages, that discrepancy.

I HT: Quite. I have tried not to be disgruntled, and maybe I haye been dismayed,
but I‘ve tried to prove, and I have, that I have produced more than the
men with a higher salary. And the men know it. And the presidents know
it. and the deans know it. end I mean produce at the scholarly level.

EBD

But that seems to be one of the conditions all over the world, that‘s why
you have the women's lib movement now, who are trying to sat the same
salaries. But maybe that condition will never exist until the end of the
world.

HT: Yes. Do you feel that there has been a void in your life because you
didn*t marry and have children?

- EBD: I think every woman should marry. I used to tell the students in my class
that...we11, this may seem narrow, but it has to do merely with religious
principles. I think if your beliefs vary from the beliefs of a person

. that you are about to marry, well, don‘t marry, if that comes first_

I Then you may marry a person haying those same beliefs, and yet you may not

i eat ﬂlﬁﬂs in married life. But I do think you will get along better if your
religious beliefs are the same. Because if you keep Saturday and another

| PETEDH kEEPS Sunday, Hall, the husband may want the children to be brought up
35 PEDP1E keeping Sunday. Seventh-day Adventists believe in the seyenth—day
sabbath, that was initiated in the Garden of Eden. on the seventh day God

l rested from all of his work, he didn't do any work. When Jesus was here,

| he kept the sewenth—day sabbath, he went to the synagogue every sabbath,

as his rustom was, the bible tells us. I think that is where the trouble

tomes. But if you're not interested in religion, then it doesn‘t make

any difference whom you marry.

MI: I know from my own esperienee, though, that you have many students who are,
in a sense, your children, that you have touched their lives in some way,

- and they tell you about it. It may be not that year, or the next year, but

I five or ten years later. I know you have touched some students. yﬂu

mentioned one this morning, one young man.

EED: well, that gives you a satisfaction, knowing that you have done that, that‘s
better than all the monetary award that one could get for teaching. I think
money doesn‘t pay for...that's material. That deosn‘t pay far intellectual
or spiritual benefits that you may get. They outweigh the financial reward
that you reoeiye. So I think if you have a different outlook upon life, it
helps you to go through women's lib, and all of these other discrepancies
that appear between men and women. If you are a Fundamentalist, you know
that one day, that all those things will disappear. But I think that the
women's lib is doing a good work__,a_yery good work. But if you’re interested
in something else rather than that, then you don't mind it at all. yﬂu don't
mind not being a member.

' NT: The young man who tame around this morning to help me with the reoorder,
I didn‘t you touch his life in some way?

EBD: Uh, he was a student of mine, and I really had forgotten him until he told
me, when I came back. But he was one of the students of mine, and Mervin
was one of my students, maybe that's the one.

HT: Yes.

EED: Well, he was. I'll neyer forget him. When I ”33 teaching, I had Put some
I papers that I wanted to keep in a trash basket. I don't know whether you
have any unusual plates for keeping papers that you want, but I had put the
trash basket over by the window behind my desk. Wall, when Heryin came to
work for meI he thought that that was trash, and he threw out all this music.
I had musical scripts there; he threw them out. Hhen I was looking for them,

EBB: {oont.) I asked him, "What did you do with the paper that was in the trash
basket?" He said, "Wall, I threw these out, Dr. Dykes. I didn't know you
wanted them." But I wasn‘t angry heoause I had no business putting them
into the trash basket. I did try to hide it, but he was trying to do what
he thought was right. And when people who work for you do something that is
not exactly right. welltI don‘t like to embarrass them.

MT: No.

EED: Do you?

MT: 0h, no, no. Ewen though it may hurt. But he does niee things for you,
now, not because of the trash basket.

EED: No, not heoause of that. He's always been one of my campus sons.

MI: Sons.

EBB: Yes, I eall him...and he calls me "Hother." His wife calls me "Mother,”
"Mother Dykes." In fact I was invited to their house last week, or two
weeks ago. She said, "Are you coming up to our house? We want you to
come to our houSe for Thanksgiving." And I said, "Oh, I have another
engagement."

HT: That's good. You generally have engagements on Thanksgiving and Christmas?
I mean, people generally remember you?

BED: Yes, they inwite me. I'm already invited out to Christmas, now.

HT: Yes. I have been thirty-fiwe years in Washington, and so far, I don‘t
know how long it will continua, someone remembers me for Thanksgiving and
for Christmas.

EBB: I think they remember the lonely at heart. That‘s from a song. Yes, they
do remember you.

HT: Yes. And I try to have things other times of the year. I don't even try
to have Christmas dinner, because I know families are together. But in
January, I have a Chinese New Year's dinner.

EBD: oh, you do?

HT: Because it‘s Chinese New Year in the period. And have Chinese food, which
is a change from leftover turkey and ham, and they seem to enjoy it. But
so far, I've always been invited out for Christmas and Thanksgiving. How,
this Thanksgiving, of coursE, has passed. And that particular hostess
had four women who did not have husbands. She went out of her way. Two
of them had lost their husbands within the last two or three years, and
the other——of CDUTSEI. I had not had one--Wﬂs a widow of a longer period...
a judge of the district court, he had died several years heck. I guess
it WEE noticeable t0 them-wI noticed it right away-eethat these were women
who did not have husbands and families. And she had us along with other
people, her family, her relatives, you see...

here at Dakwood. But I could attend only one.

around tomorrow?" But they never do. [laughter] I go home to a cupboard
that‘s hare, so to speak, and then I get out steak, something different
from turkey.

MT: Yesterday we reviewed several aspects of Dr. Dykes'saetiwities, and
teaching. I was particularly interested in her musical activities, the
feet that early in life she was playing the piano, and the organ, and then
directing ohoirs. Later on in life, that continued, at a different level.
the Messiah, for example, conducting that here, at Oakwood College. Now,
I think she will mention some people who are famous as musicians, whom she
aeoompanied at various times. Who are some of those people, Dr. Dykes?

EBB: I aooompanied Louis ?aughn Jones, who was a teacher of violin at Howard
University, and I understand that now he is deceased; Wesley Howard, who was
a friend of Louie's; Lillian Avanti, who was the first blush soloist. or
musician, to sing abroad; Jessph H. Douglass, the grandson of Frederick
Douglass; Estelle Pinokney, who was from Texas—Hshe same to Howard to
teeth, and she was a well-known musician; and many others. I can't remember
all of their names.

NT: You mention Louia Vaughn Jones. I loved his ability with the violin. Not
being a musician myself,I but I know what I enjoy, and what I appreciate.
You know he lost his eyesight after he retired?

EBB: Yes, he told me.

HT: But yet he knew his way around Howard, that is, in the fine arts building.
Hetd often go down to the Library of Congress, and they appreciated him so
much there that they would inwite him to play on the Stradivarius violins
in their collection.

EBB: Well, that was a wonderful tribute to his skill.

HT: And people would hear this marvelous music and some...not a concert, but just
people who would hear this. and gather. To hear the artist, a hlind artist
at that, playing the Stradivarius.

EBB: Well, he was noted for his feeling, the feeling that oould enter his music.
And I think that made him one of our great yiolinists. I'm glad to hear
that, about his going to the congressional library.

HT: Yes. How I didn't realise...I knew you had majored in English, and had your
Ph-D- in EngliShe and taught English at Howard, but you actually studied
music at Howard under some of the professors there? While you were teaching
there, or when you were a student? obviously, when you were a student at
Howard. Who were some of your teachers there?

EBB: Some of my teachers were Roy Tibhs, and Cecil Cohen.

HT: Well, they were therEt-Eﬁd have since retired, of oourse—-when I was at
Howard. I was interested when you mentioned Tihhs. And I remember Cohen
too.

EBB: You remember recalling Tihhs?

MT: I think his name moms my in the Twenty-Fiwe Year Club, and of course it’s

twenty—fiwe years mod more“ I think perhaps one of the longest to be employed
there, after two'woty dear ladies in the music department, you know those
two ladies, MadelihuhL thiaman and Carolyn V. Grant.

EBD: Yes. And by the whys he was married to Lillian hwanti.

EBB: well, I may say that I was visiting in Nashville...Hr. Tihbs was a resident
of Nashville once. I don't remember where he lived, altogether, but I do
know he did live in Nashville for a while. And I went to a lady's house,
and someone asked ms to play. So I played just a short composition, and the
person said, 1”I know Roy Tihbs was your teacher, by the way you played."

And I said, "Yes, he was my teacher." But she didn't know that, she merely
knew that I was from.Washington,D.ﬂ. But she said I played like Roy Tihhs,
and I thought that was very great compliment—-not to me, but to Roy Tihbs.

HT: Yes, I too nodersta“d. Wow that was while you were living in Washington,
obviously.

EBB: Yes.

MT: And these musicians had eoneerts there. Did you ever travel with them?

EED: No, I never traveled with them, but I did travel with Estelle Pinekney,
who is deceased. I traveled with [inaudible], but I didn't travel with
her, but she same to Boston to give a recital. She sang there, and then
afterwards she asked me to go down to Rhode Island, and give a recital there.

HT: Now, when you came to Dakwood, in addition to directing the Messiah, did
you aoeompany people here?

EBB: Yes, I aeeompanied Louis, Louis tame down here to give a reoital once.
MT: ﬂh, Jonea.

EBB: He did, and then Margaret Montgomery same here to give a recital. a lady
who was oalled the "prima donna of the South" same here, and in fast she
taught here for a little while. I aoeompanied her. I ean‘t reeall her
name new, but I can see her now. I have one of her pictures somewhere.
I've played foratnumher of people who oame here, and I used to play for the
EhurEh--pian0, 5f CDUTSE, I didn't play the organ.

MT: The ohureh here on the...
EBB: The ehuroh here at ﬂatwood, mm hmm.

HT: Yes. and I notice. since I've been here, you sit down oeeasionally at the
piano, and it‘s yery beautiful music that I hear.

EBB: Well, thank you. But I am out of practice now. In order to he a musician
you have to practice a number of hours every day. Haze1.,.oh3r I‘ve also
aooompanied Hazel Harrison. I didn't aooompany her--she was my teacher,
also, at oakwood. And she used to get up early in the morning at Howard
University, three o'clock, and practice the piano lessons. end she taught
me for a while, too. I was a teaoher then at Howard.

MT: Oh, yes, I remember her.
EBB: Do you remember her?
MT: oh, yes, they were in my early period at Howard.

EBB: Well, you are not in my generation, by any means, hut I'm glad you remember

them.
HT: 1 em in yours, we‘re contemporaries.
EBB: As far as teaching is ooneerned.
MT: Yea, at Howard, yes, we were contemporaries. How, haying taught at

Howard, and also here at Oakwood, at which institution do you feel that
you have made the greater contribution, or is it about equal?

EED: Well, I imagine I have made the same contribution to both sohools, I could
say that. Being a Sewenth-day Adventist, we believe that the Lord is coming
soon. When Jesus was here, in Matthew 2a, he did announce the signs 3f His
coming. Paul also announced the sight of His coming. and man? of the signs
of His coming are believed by Sewenth-day Adventists. For example, we
heliewe that there will he, as prophesied in Revelation, a unity between
Ehurﬁh and state. For many Years that union has been attempted. For a
while, in IIQB, the unity was lost. But now there is a rewiwal of that unity.
There is an attempt on the part of many people, not only business people,
to sell on Sunday, the first day of the weekt but also on the part of reli-
gious people, maybe to penalize in some places those who do not keep Sunday,
but who do keep Saturday.

I may say that as far as my religious beliefs are oonoerned, I think I did
make a contribution toward introducing some people at Howard to what I
believed. For example, I met a teacher there by the name of Anderson.
When he saw me one day in the hall. in the main building, he said to me,
1”How do you do, Dr. Dykes? What‘s the news?" end before I could think,

I said to him, ”Saturday is the sabbath. why don't you keep it?" I don't
know why I said that EHPTEEEIDH. He told me afterwards when I was at the
northeastern conference that he heeame an Adventist heeause of what I said
to him in the hall.

Personally, in view of my beliefs, I do think that the contribution I made
there was the same as I made here. I was primarily oonoerned with using the
little talent that I did have, to promote what we believe as Adventists.
Hell, I won't go any more into detail, but that‘s one of the reasons I came
to ﬂakwood, instead of staying at Howard University.

Hy unole, however, wanted me to stay there, heoause he said that I could,
maybe by living the right kind of life, influence people at Howard, as well
as ooming to Oakwood. But Oakwood was striving later for aoereditatiou, so
I came down here, and I thought I could help out in that way. So I've
enjoyed teaching at both Howard University and at Oakwood College.

HT: Well, that's fine. You have no regrets.

EBB: No, I have no regrets at all,

MT: No. Well that's fine. It’s good to some to our later years without too
many regrets.

EBB: In fact, I was placed on indefinite tenure, when I first came down here.
for a number of years, heoause some of the people at Howard University thought
that I would some haek. But I had made my decision, and I decided to stay
here.

MT: Well, now that you are definitely retired, and are looking forward to an
indefinite number of years, but many activities—-you‘re not by any means sitting
in a rocking ehair—-how do you feel toward the ending of life here on earth?

EED: -Hy main ambition, being a Fundamentalist, and not a freethinker, is to be
ready when I die. I know that I have passed the threesoore and ten that has
been allotLed to man. But i look forward, not to dying, but I wish to he
ready when I do die. That's the main point. So I don't mind dying at all,
but I want to be ready when I do.

HI: That could he a splendid oonelusion to our interview. I don't know of
anything finer that one might say. This is your interview, not mine; I
will have my opportunity. Eut I would like to say that I do not fear death.
I‘ve been near it, that is, clinically dead, and extreme unotion in the
Catholic ehureh is beyond anything that you oan imagine.

BED: Yes.

MT: They say, the person who has had extreme unotion and survived is very
fortunate. But death can be beautiful. I have no fears of it. Obviously,
I hope I don't die in a flaming airplane, or under a great deal of steel
and metal on a train or plane, hut I‘m just hoping I oan drift away. It
can be beautiful.

EBB: Well, I think your attitude is the same as mine.
