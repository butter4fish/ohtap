If you would, Reverend Wilmore, just for the record please tell us your full name and spell it.
Speaker 2: My full name is Gayraud Steven Wilmore.  Are we on camera now?
Speaker 1: Yes sir.
Speaker 2: And I would add junior because my father was Gayraud Stephen Wilmore, Sr. but I haven't used junior for a long time, I never liked it.

Speaker 2: I was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on December 20, 1921.
Speaker 1: And your occupation?
Speaker 2: I am a Presbyterian minister (laugh).  You keep calling me reverend which reminds of that but most of my ministry has been teaching.  So I'm used to the term professor or doctor as well as minister.  But my profession is really a teacher of ministers and a writer of books.

Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 192378
Speaker 1: Now if you will, Dr. [HistoryMaker Reverend Gayraud] Wilmore, tell me a little about your mother starting with her name, where she was born and where she grew up.
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Patricia Gardner Wilmore.  Her maiden name was Gardner.  She was born and raised in Gloucester County, Virginia.  The little place was called James Store, Virginia, that's the name of the area in which she was born and raised very near the James River [Virginia] and really in the country.  It was a plantation and it was a plantation that was owned, I think, by northern whites after the war--after the Civil War and I think she knew some Quaker people after who may have been related in some way to the owners.  I visited Gloucester when I was a child, she used to go back.  That was the custom in those days, you know, to take the children back to your home of the mother or grandmother.  So I remember it as just a little country place with a farm and horse and buggy and cows and all of that, you know.
Speaker 1: Did she ever share any stories with you about growing up and what life was like for her growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes somewhat as a matter fact, I've audio taped some, oh I guess an hour or two of her life and background for the children.  I've got to find that audio tape; I'm not sure where it is now.  But she talked about growing up in the black community especially in the Baptist church and being baptized in the river--in the James River [Virginia] and she talked about a world that was a black world.  She hardly knew any white people I gather and about her brothers.  She had a number of brothers, I guess about seven or eight brothers all uncles of mine, you know, that I never really got to know any of them because she moved during the First World War [WWI, World War I] to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] to work for a white family and there she met my father, Gayraud [S. Wilmore, Sr.], who was born and raised in Philadelphia incidentally and came back from the First World War to marry this young country girl from Virginia.
Story_ID: 192379
Speaker 1: What can you tell us about your father [Gayraud S. Wilmore, Sr.] starting with his name and where he was born?
Speaker 2: I've been very much interested in doing some research on the Wilmore name.  I haven't done much on my mother [Patricia Gardner Wilmore].  My brother has a family tree based on my mother but I've been interested in where Wilmore came from.  My father's father was named Stephen Wilmore and they came from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], they were Philadelphians but originally they came out of Maryland, Hartford County and I traced the Wilmores in Hartford County by visiting Hartford County and looking into some old books and records there.  Very interesting story, we don't have time to go into depth but in the 19th century a black man by the name of Godfrey [ph.] Wilmore took an Irish servings girl from that county and crossed the border of Pennsylvania and Maryland into Pennsylvania and founded a little mill on a creek there and that place became Wilmore, Pennsylvania.  I once got a letter from a librarian of that town saying I think that your relatives founded this place.  I've seen your picture in the newspaper and I think you look just like the people who were Wilmores here.  And so I took my son--my youngest son and my nephew and we drove to Wilmore, Pennsylvania from Philadelphia and there was nothing there, you know, except a wide place in the road with two or three houses but a great massive Roman Catholic church.  You know how the Roman Catholics build churches.  It was a church forever, you know and I went up to the parish house and knocked on the door, the parsonage which was next door.  The priest opened the door and looked at me and looked at the two kids that I had with me and said, "You are Wilmores" (laugh).  I said you're right, how do you know that?  He said, "Come on in," I went in and he took me into the library and showed a picture of these half white Wilmores going way back looking very much like my father with the same kind of gross features of my dad and a large nose and mouth and so forth.  And he told me that the Wilmores founded, this white and black couple founded this little town and the Roman Catholic church in Pittsburgh heard about it and sent a priest there to found the church because people were gathering there because of the mill and that's the story of Wilmore, Pennsylvania.  My dad never told me about this, I had to dig this up myself.  But I do know there was some very half white, very light skinned Wilmores in Philadelphia who came out of that family, very interesting story.
Story_ID: 192380
Speaker 1: Dr. [HistoryMaker Reverend Gayraud] Wilmore, one thing I didn't ask you is how would you describe your mother [Patricia Gardner Wilmore]?
Speaker 2: Mother was a very placid, quiet person, loving, hard-working.  I remember during my boyhood, she worked for a white family downtown Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and came home late and tired every night during the [Great] Depression when my father [Gayraud S. Wilmore, Sr.] had no work.  Right after the First World War the black veterans were very poor, many of them sold apples on the streets of Philadelphia during the early '20s [1920s] before the Great Depression.  So my mother was the only one working for a long time and I remember her coming home.  I was the oldest son so I was expected to prepare the meal and have everything ready.  Dad was walking the streets looking for a job most of the time.  He finally found a job working for a dental school on Diamond Street in Philadelphia and then he went to work for the Quartermaster's Depot in Philadelphia.  But I recall that mother carried our family in her quiet, unassuming way.  Very strong Christian, she happily became a Presbyterian as did the whole family when the Presbyterian church invited the North Philadelphia civic league to form a Presbyterian church at 21st and Columbia Avenue [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and a big building that was already there but was hardly used by the white congregation.  The white congregation had fled so to speak and there this building was and so the Philadelphia presbytery said to my father and to Dr. John K. Rice who were the leaders of the North Philadelphia Civic League, would you like to have that building?  It's got a bowling alley in it, got a lot of classrooms, got a gymnasium, a basketball court and a sanctuary.  So almost overnight the North Philadelphia civic league became the McDowell Presbyterian church [later, McDowell Memorial Presbyterian Church, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and we all shifted from the Baptist church to the Presbyterian church as did many of the people who were the founding members of that church.  So my parents were Presbyterian although they came out of the Baptist family.
Story_ID: 192381
Speaker 1: And how would you describe your father [Gayraud S. Wilmore, Sr.]?
Speaker 2: My father was a very interesting man in the sense that he was a builder and a founder.  He founded the Crispus Attucks American Legion Post [Crispus Attucks Post 151 American Legion, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] which was the first black American Legion Post in the country in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] named after the great hero who gave his life in the revolutionary war on the Boston Common, Crispus Attucks.  And Dad was also one of the founding members of the O.V. Catto Elks Lodge in Philadelphia.  He was a founder of a number of Boy Scout troops and was honored by the Philadelphia Counsel of Boy Scouts for his work as a scout master and a founder of troops.  He founded the north Philadelphia Civic League that I just mentioned with Dr. John K. Rice and also a number of block clubs.  So he was that kind of a person.  An organizer, builder, his dream was to be a journalist and to have a newspaper that he and I would own and edit and write for and he did write, he was a good writer and I think I learned how to write from him.  I was inspired to write by him and I had some of his, still have some of his writings.  So he was not well educated, he taught himself.  I think he did not finish high school, taught himself and read the dictionary and encyclopedias and incidentally owned a real estate business which crashed with the big crash in 1929.  So that was sort of wiped out but before that he had studied law--real estate law on his own and he and another man founded this real estate business.  So dad was an activist, he was a race man and he was a very strong for Marcus Garvey and although dad never described himself as a Garveyite yet I know he admired Marcus Garvey and did a lot of talking about black people and their struggles in America and the necessity of all of us working for social justice for African Americans--the Negroes in those days, you know.  So I learned a lot from my father and in my new book which just came out last week, I had a sermon which I preach called 'Lessons from my Father's World' in which I describe some of the things I learned from him.
Story_ID: 192382
Speaker 1: Dr. [HistoryMaker Reverend Gayraud] Wilmore what can you tell me about your grandparents on your mother's [Patricia Gardner Wilmore] side, your maternal grandparents starting with their name and whatever you know about them and their background?
Speaker 2: I don't know very much.  I wish my brother were here because he could tell you those names.  I believe my mother's mother was named Fannie [ph.].  Her father, the name escapes me just now but I never knew them.  I only knew them as a child, as a young child being taken back to Gloucester County, Virginia.  You know five, six, seven, eight not even after I became over twelve, I don't think we went back after that.  So I have very poor memories of grandparents on either side.  Now on my father's side my grandmother came to live with us for a while.  She lived up on the third floor of the house that we lived in on Nicklaus Street [ph.] and her name was Pricilla Nelson [ph.] and she married somebody named Nelson after her first husband died, Steve [ph.] Wilmore.  Grandpa or my step grandfather I guess you'd call him also lived on the third floor there with her until he passed, he passed after she did.  So I did know them but I didn't know her mother.  Now she told me that her first husband was a slave, I think she told me that, Stephen Wilmore.
Speaker 1: Did she share any other stories with you?
Speaker 2: Not that I remember, Racine.  I do remember her devout Christian commitment but she was a strange kind of Christian who blended what I would call the remnants of African religion which came out of slavery with Roman Catholicism and Protestantism and on her bureau in her room, little room up on the third floor, she had a little alter, you know, and candles and a prayer book and other ritual objects, including a thunder stone which comes out of the Caribbean religion of, I can't think of the name of it just now.  But she had taken everything that came to a slave community about God and how you worship God and had made it her own.  So while she was Baptist, she was a syncretistic Baptist you might say who blended African traditional religions which came out of the Caribbean as well with orthodox Christianity, very interesting woman.
Speaker 1: Tell me Dr. Wilmore what is your earliest (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Shango is the name of the God that used thunderstones who worshipped with people who kept thunderstones which came out of the Caribbean.
Story_ID: 192383
Speaker 1: What is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: Earliest memory, a very early memory is the coming of white immigrants from Eastern Europe into the neighborhood in which we lived.  Boys and girls who came from Poland or someplace in eastern Europe, Russia who didn't speak English, who were coming into this black neighborhood because that was the cheapest rental property you could find.  They came as immigrants just at the close of the great European immigration to the United States in the early '20s [1920s] which was stopped after the First World War [WWI, World War I].  I remember that we taught how to speak English and--the kids but I also remember that very shortly after they arrived, like maybe six months or a year, they learned the word nigger from white people and they soon moved out to neighborhoods that were not open to us in the next ring of residential living in North Philadelphia.  So that's a early memory, I remember fighting white boys on my way to Fairmount Park [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] which was not far from where we lived but you had to fight to get through to Fairmount Park at 26th and 27th Street on Jefferson and on some of those other streets that ran out to the park.  You would almost always be accosted by white gangs or white kids and you had to fight.  So those are early memories.  I went to a white school; I never had a black teacher when I was in either elementary school or high school.  I went to a school called Kane Elementary School [ph.] and the earliest memory I have is of the smell of the carpet in the kindergarten class (laugh), at Kane elementary school [Elisha Kent Kane School].  It was a straw carpet and I remember the woman's name was Mrs. Rudolph [ph.].  Mrs. Rudolph was the kindergarten teacher, white woman of course, very kind, very nice to me and I and a few other little black children from that neighborhood went through our first grades at Kane.
Story_ID: 192384
Speaker 1: Dr. [HistoryMaker Reverend Gayraud] Wilmore tell me a little bit about what your family life was like?  What was it like growing up, what was a typical day like for you as a young boy?
Speaker 2: Well of course there was school, elementary school at [Elisha Kent] Kane [School] then there was playing baseball on four corners.  I remember the street, first base would be on that corner over there and second base there then that corner over there and there weren't many cars in those days.  So you didn't have to worry about traffic.  The pitcher stood in the middle of the street and threw the ball and you'd hit it and hope you didn't break a window.  I also played football in the street.  We played tackle football on that hard pavement in North Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  I remember organizing clubs that was a big thing when I was a boy.  Parents belonged to social clubs, there was the church and then there were social clubs.  I remember my mother and father organized one called Beyond the New and I organized a society for discussing philosophy and theology and not too long ago a friend of mine who was a boyhood friend, gave me the little membership card we had printed.  I am member of this philosophical society (laugh).  I'm amazed, you know, that as an elementary school kid I was thinking and reading that kind of thing.  But I also remember going to the library a lot.  Most--that's the one thing that characterizes my day.  I spent a lot of time in a library.  The Widener Branch [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] of the library which was on Montgomery Avenue several blocks from my home but after school, I would go there.  They had a museum next door to the library; I spent a lot of time there.  I already told you about fighting and going to Fairmount Park [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] which is a great park.  One of the largest urban parks in the country and we spent a lot of time there.  It was a happy childhood and I had a lot of friends both boys and girls.  I remember we had wars with white kids who lived a few blocks away from us to the west.  In an old cemetery that was on the corner of 25th and Diamond Street [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  It ran from Diamond several blocks away and it was an abandoned cemetery with open graves where they had taken the bodies out but sometimes some of the bones were still there and we would play in that cemetery.  It was overgrown with brush and small trees and so forth and what we would do is to fight--the gangs would fight one another by throwing spears that we made out of the canes that grew in there.  Throwing those spears at one another and we would have armies maybe fifty kids on each side and we would maneuver through that place and send out scouts and was a real game sort of thing.  So it was not vicious, you know, there were no guns or knives or anything like that, it was a game, a war game and we did that for, I guess, several years when I was growing up.
Story_ID: 192385
Speaker 1: Dr. [HM Reverend Gayraud] Wilmore tell me what sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sights, sounds and smells, well my mother [Patricia Gardner Wilmore] was a great cook so anytime I smelled a good chicken, good food I think of my mother and my wife will tell you that she was the greatest cook.  When I go back to Philadelphia now I saddened by the change that has taken place, the deterioration in the neighborhoods in which I grew up.  They have been stepping stones for people moving from very great poverty into black middle class but that's the first step that neighborhood that I grew up in.  Then you move further north out to Oak Lane, and German Town and so forth.  So, the sights of a slum community remind me of the ghetto, I grew up in a ghetto.  The only white people that I knew were Jews who owned grocery stores on one or the other corner in that neighborhood where we did our shopping.  I knew white-I saw white insurance people come in and collect for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and other insurance companies and I saw white policemen.  Other than that it was a black world.
Speaker 1: What sounds remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Jazz, and it was a great jazz time.  As a matter of fact when we lived on Jefferson Street, we lived right next door to Blanche Calloway who was Cab Calloway's sister and she had her own orchestra and I remember the big bus that she and her orchestra rode around in being parked out in front of our house because we were at adjoining steps with Blanche Calloway.  So I saw Cab and we went to the theater, the Nixon Grand [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and we went downtown to the theater and saw Jimmy Lunceford and I can't tell you the names of all of the great jazz--Louis Armstrong and all the great jazz orchestra leaders of that period.  But--Duke Ellington, you know, so forth.
Story_ID: 192386
Speaker 1: Share with us again the name of your elementary school and were there any teachers there who influenced you?
Speaker 2: Not there, high school.  It was called Elisha Kane.
Speaker 1: Would you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: E-L-I-S-H-A, I guess, Kent, K-E-N-T, Kane, K-A-N-E elementary school and it was at 26th and Jefferson Street [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] I believe.  It was grades kindergarten to not--to eighth.
Speaker 1: And what was elementary school like for you?
Speaker 2: You know I don't have a very good memory of elementary school.  I remember that it became increasingly black.  It started out as an all white school with just a few blacks coming into it.  It was on the edge of the ghetto, right on the edge and at first, I guess we weren't being permitted to go to that school but slowly it opened up and then we began to crowd it out.  But we had all white teachers.  I remember that they could pull the walls back--the partition between classrooms and open it up for a large auditorium-type setting and I remember singing, I like to sing, and I remember singing a solo in one of those assemblies.  I remember the kids laughing at me.  I was singing 'What a Difference a Day Makes' and it was (unclear).  I didn't have any accompaniment (singing) what a difference a day makes, twenty four little hours, at each pause the kids would laugh (laughter).  I remember that, I guess I'll never forget that.
Story_ID: 192387
Speaker 1: What kind of student were you in elementary school [Elisha Kent Kane School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: I was a good student, I was a first rate student.  And I studied and read a lot; I did a lot of reading.  I was athletic, I played football, baseball but I also read and I studied geography and I studied rocks, I used to collect rocks in Fairmount Park and make a collection of them and insects and other things like that, you know.  Just gathering and making collections of things, stamps.  So I was a good student and then I went from there to high school--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: And what kind of child were you at that age during the elementary school years, what kind of child were you?  Were you well-mannered, mischievous, what kind of child?
Speaker 2: Oh you need to ask somebody else that question.  I think I was probably mischievous, I think I did a lot of things my mother wouldn't approve of but she never knew.  She gave me a good bit of freedom.  I had two brothers, I forgot to mention them--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: And would you please give your siblings' names in the order of their birth including yourself?
Speaker 2: Okay my brother Jack is five years younger than I, his name is Jacques Edward Wilmore [ph.].  He's named after one of my mother's brothers, Edward.  But his first name Jacques came from my father who had been in the First World War [World War I, WWI] in France and came back enamored of the French people.  So he spoke a little French and so he named his second child, Jacques.
Story_ID: 192388
Speaker 1: Dr. [HM Reverend Gayraud] Wilmore if you would just please tell us your siblings' names and their birth order including yourself.  Just their names and their birth order.
Speaker 2: I was the oldest son; I was born December 20, 1921.  Three years later my middle brother was born, his name is Alfred [G.] Wilmore, and he was named after one of my mother's brothers.  He is now deceased, he was a baseball player, professional baseball player in the National Negro League, pitcher.  And my third brother--third child born to my mother and father was Jacques Wilmore, he was my youngest brother who now lives in Tanzania East Africa.  Do you want to know more about them?
Speaker 1: Sure what would you like to share with us about them?
Speaker 2: Well Alfred as I said was a professional ball player.  He played in South America and in Cuba and was sent to the Philadelphia Athletics Farm Club [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and I think Colorado and then got bursitis in his arm so he never came up.  But he knew Jackie--he played with Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella and all those great black ball players who were the first to break into the white baseball leagues.  He played ball all of his life.  After he retired with a bad arm, he organized ball clubs in Philadelphia especially soft ball.  Softball was a great thing in Philadelphia when we were growing up and I recall that he had a soft ball club that was sponsored by a bar where he worked.  He was a bartender also and most of his life, I think probably counseled more people as a bartender than I did as a clergyman (laughter).
Speaker 1: And your other brother?
Speaker 2: Jacques was very bright, he went to Lincoln University [Pennsylvania] as I did, Al never went to college.  But Jacques did his graduate work at Haverford College in [Haverford] Pennsylvania and then went to work for the American Fund Service Committee and for the Urban League of New York in Westchester County [New York] and finally he went with [Samuel DeWitt] Sam Proctor whom you may have had heard of, a very distinguished black minister, former president of Virginia Union University [Richmond, Virginia] to Africa where they organized and led the Peace Corps.  He was deputy director of the Peace Corps in Nigeria.  Then he was director of the Peace Corps in Tanzania and worked for Save the Children and now owns a computer factory--a computer business in Dar es Salaam, married an African woman--a Tanzanian woman.  He has two children of his second marriage, went to Lincoln University also.  He came to the United States and Wasi [ph.] Wilmore, a beautiful young girl who just graduated this last commencement and is looking for a job in international finance (laughter).
Story_ID: 192389
Speaker 1: Dr. [HM Reverend Gayraud] Wilmore let's talk a little bit about the elementary school [Elisha Kent Kane School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] years.  At this time in your life did you have dreams and aspirations?
Speaker 2: When I was going to--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Elementary school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Elementary school? Yes, I did.  I think I wanted to be a writer and I did some writing as a young boy.  When I went to high school I did a good bit of writing and I won an essay contest--a city [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] wide essay contest on Benjamin Franklin and his contribution to America.  I was encouraged to do that essay by a white teacher at Benjamin Franklin High School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] by the name of Williams [ph.] and he encouraged me.  He knew that I could write and he encouraged me to write and so lo and behold this young black boy from a ghetto of North Philadelphia wins this city-wide contest and my father [Gayraud S. Wilmore, Sr.] and I had to go down to the Poor Richard Club which is Benjamin Franklin's own elite club downtown Philadelphia, all white men for a luncheon and my father was just as nervous as he could be.  We were also in a parade that went down Benjamin Franklin Parkway and they gave me a beautiful plaque and a five-year membership to the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  I guess I was the first black person to ever be a member of the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: What's the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia?
Speaker 2: It was an elite society of scientists and philosophers and distinguished people who admired Benjamin Franklin and who, I guess, were mostly scientists and inventors and that kind of thing.  I used to go to the library at the Franklin Institute and walk in there with my membership card and they would look at me, at this little boy.  I was reading metaphysics, and science--philosophy of science in that great library all by myself and I would read for hours and then get up and go.
Speaker 1: And just going back a little bit to the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was quite an adventure for me.
Story_ID: 192390
Speaker 1: To the junior high school years, who were some of your friends around that age and who was influencing you as a young person in those early teen years?
Speaker 2: Well I mentioned Charles Williams [ph.] who was my teacher at Benjamin Franklin High School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  I didn't go to junior high school; you know, I went right into high school from elementary school [Elisha Kent Kane School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Right. But around those years like seventh, eighth grade who was influencing you, who were some of your friends?
Speaker 2: My greatest influence, I guess during that period was my father [Gayraud S. Wilmore, Sr.] who as I told you wanted to have a newspaper and wanted me to be one of the reporters or editors of the newspaper.  He was going to be the publisher.  My other great influence was Reverend Arthur E. Rankin who was the pastor of McDowell Presbyterian Church that I told you about, a graduate of Lincoln University [Pennsylvania] who influenced me to go to Lincoln and who taught me a great deal.  Arthur E. Rankin wrote a little book which tells the story of the native Africans who brought [David] Livingstone's body to the coast after he died and helped to ship it back to England for a great celebration but were not able to accompany the body and that was quite a story and he wrote a little book on that.  So I was interested in writing, I was inspired by writers and thinkers like my father, like Dr. Rankin as we called him, he had an honorary degree, I think, from Lincoln.
Story_ID: 192391
Speaker 1: What were the high school years like for you and what was the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: I went to Central High School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] first of all which was a leading boys high school in the United States, they gave a degree in the years that I went there and in the middle of my high school years, Central High School moved far north in Philadelphia to a new building and the building that was left was renamed Benjamin Franklin High School [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], the school that was left.  So I really graduated from Benjamin Franklin but started off at Central. Those--
Speaker 1: What was high school like for you?
Speaker 2: High school was a good experience for me.  I learned a lot, I did a lot of writing.  I think I wrote for the newspaper--the student newspaper and I told you about the essay on Benjamin Franklin which was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What year was that when you won that essay?
Speaker 2: I would have to stop and figure that out.
Speaker 1: Well what year were you in high school? Was it your junior year?
Speaker 2: Okay I told you I was born in 1921.
Speaker 1: Yes sir.
Speaker 2: I went to kindergarten in 1925; I was about five years old in 1926, right? So eight years from 1926, you count 'em, that takes me to what?
Speaker 1: Nineteen thirty-four.
Speaker 2: Thirty-four [1934] okay then four years of high school would '38 [1938].  I graduated from high school in '38 [1938].
Speaker 1: So around 1937/1938 you won the essay contest.
Speaker 2: So the essay contest was won probably in '37 [1937].
Speaker 1: And tell me a little bit about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I don't have that plaque anymore either.  I don't have anything from that period.
Speaker 1: You spoke about one of your high school teachers but do you remember any of the others?  Can you share some stories about some of the others (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes. I remember Ducky House [ph.], we called him Ducky House [ph.] was my Latin teacher.  I took almost four years of Latin which helped my writing a great deal.  I remember him as a (unclear), severe, hardnosed Latin teacher.  He made you stand up and conjugate verbs before everybody and if you didn't do it right, he would sit you down and make you stay in school and study harder and whatever.  But he was a character.  Let's see if I remember anybody else.  I don't remember anybody else really except Charles Williams and Ducky House.
Story_ID: 192392
Speaker 1: How did you spend your time in high school [Central High School later, Benjamin Franklin High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: What do you mean?
Speaker 1: How did you spend your time during--as a boy in high school?  What did you do in your spare time that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: I was involved in an organization which we called 'The Maskin Wiggers' [ph.].  We founded a play group--a drama club at the McDowell Presbyterian Church, that's where I met my wife [Lee Ella Wilson].  We put on one act play on Saturday nights in that nice gymnasium that they had with a stage and all.  Mr. Watson [ph.] a somewhat older person than we were, he was maybe five years older than we were, was our director and also Mr. Bennett [ph.] was director at another--at a later time.  But throughout my high school years I was involved in drama clubs.  I was also involved in discussion groups and study groups.  I flirted with communism as a young man and joined the Young Communist League both during my late years of high school and my early years in college [Lincoln University, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: What did your parents think of that?
Speaker 2: Oh they had no objection because the communist were the only ones in my period who cared anything about African American civil rights and my father, as I told you, was a Garveyite and therefore we were all radical people, you know, and radicalism was not so radical in the circles in which I moved.  So I knew communist young people, Jews mostly and when I went to college I used to go up to New York [New York] for meetings.  I don't want to jump ahead of myself because I know you want to know about the college years but we left the communist party and the Young Communist League when we learned that we had no freedom to think for ourselves, that we were supposed to take everything they said as the gospel truth and not question them.  But before that time we were very radical in our ideas of political economy and philosophy.

Speaker 1: As a young boy in high school [Central High School later, Benjamin Franklin High School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] did you know you were going to college [Lincoln University, Pennsylvania]?  What were your thoughts about college?
Speaker 2: I didn't know if I was going to college.  My plan was to go to sea and I and a little white boy, Jewish boy named Bernard Ellison [ph.].  I worked as a--I forgot to tell you during my high school years, I worked as a soda jerk we used to call it in a drug store behind the counter making ice cream sodas and banana splits and all those kinds of things in Ellison's Drug Store [ph.] which was on the corner of 25th [Street] and Jefferson [Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], I guess it was 25th and Jefferson right across the street from Howard P. John's Funeral Home [ph.].  Bernard and I became good friends and we planned to run away to sea--go to sea together and we did run away.  He emptied his father's cash register one night and we took off to catch a train--to hop on a box car going to New York [New York] where we would go to the docks and try to find a ship to sail on.  We sat down on the railroad tracks to discuss it and talk ourselves out of it (laughter).  Went back and he put the money back in the cash register late at night, sneaked in and I went home.  So that was my experience of running away.  I guess I had read 'Huckleberry Finn' and all those stories about running away and going to sea and I was a great lover of the sea and a poet.  I remember I was a poet, I wrote a lot of poetry, and I was very much taken by British poetry in that period; the poets who came out of the First World War [WWI, World War I] and the poets who wrote about the sea.
Story_ID: 192394
Speaker 1: When did you decide that you would go to college [Lincoln University, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: When I found out that I couldn't go to sea, that there were real problems in getting the union to accept black young men who wanted to be deck hands.  I guess if I had just wanted to be working the kitchen, in the galley I might have been able to get a job but I wanted to be a deck hand and I learned subsequently that it was very difficult to get those jobs in New York [New York], so I gave it up.  One of my friends went ahead and did go to sea and I remember--what was his name, I can't think of it right now.  But I remember seeing him later--some years later.  He had been all over the world as a merchant seaman.  So then my father [Gayraud S. Wilmore, Sr.] said a congressman, not a congressman but a state senator--Pennsylvania state legislator lived in our neighborhood and had some scholarships to give to Lincoln University and he encouraged me to accept one of these scholarships.  State senatorial scholarship it was called and I think it paid all the tuition for Lincoln.  But you had to have your room and board, you know, and McDowell Presbyterian Church took a collection for me and I remember they put it in a sugar bag.  We used to buy sugar in a cloth bag in those days, put it in a sugar bag and I had all these nickels and dimes and quarters and a few bills and I took that to Lincoln University and spread it out over the bursar's desk when I tried to apply and he said, "son you don't have enough money there to go to college."  I said, "well that's all I have, I'm willing to work," and he gave me a job in the dining hall--in the kitchen of the dining hall so that I was able to start at Lincoln.  But I'll never forget MacDowell taking that collection for me and Rev. Rankin urging the people to support [HM Reverend] Gayraud [Wilmore] who's going off to Lincoln.
Story_ID: 192395
Speaker 1: What were your experiences like at Lincoln [University, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Well it was an all men's school in those days.  Not more than I guess 400 students--300 and some students but was the first black college for African American men founded in 1854, it was very early, before the civil war.  So it had a great tradition, you know, and a lot of hazing.  I remember we had to wear a little green skull cap as freshmen and boy did our behinds get whipped by guys with these great big fraternity paddles, it was really brutal in those days.  I lived in gut bucket which was the top floor of Crescent Hall and had no bathroom up there so they called it gut bucket, they buckets up there for the men (laughter).  And, you know, I remember water fights, Lincoln was a rough place.  It wasn't until they accepted women in the 19--late 1950s that it really became a college that you might say had some grace to it, you know, some graces.
Speaker 1: While you were at Lincoln what were you thinking (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I learned a lot there.
Speaker 1: What were you thinking you wanted to do with your life?
Speaker 2: I wanted to write, I wanted to teach English and write and I had the best teachers in the world there; Dr. Hill [ph.] and Waters Turpin who came from Baltimore [Maryland] and had written two novels.  I took a lot of sociology, anthropology but mostly English.  I was in the drama club and played the archbishop in T.S. Elliot's 'Murder in the Cathedral' which we took to black colleges in the south.  So I did drama, I didn't do any singing but I was editor of the newspaper and also one of the editors of the Lion which was the yearbook for the graduating class.  I was to graduate in 1944 but because of the war [WWII, World War II], I didn't graduate until 1947.
Story_ID: 192396
Speaker 1: Were you drafted into the war [WWII, World War II]?
Speaker 2: Well you asked me that before and I said I was in the enlisted reserve corps which means I really was--I signed up a volunteer but the promise was that you would be able to finish your college education.  So I was drafted in the sense that they did not let me finish that education and in March of 1943, they marched us down to Lincoln University Village [Pennsylvania] where we got on a train and went to Fort Meade Maryland.  So I was in the [U.S.] Army along with, I guess fifty other college students and we met incidentally at Fort Meade and other college students who were called in from the enlisted reserve corps from Morgan [State University, Baltimore, Maryland] and Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] and other black schools in the North.
Speaker 1: Tell me what some of your experiences in the Army were like as a buffalo soldier, what were those experiences like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well I called myself a buffalo soldier because we wore the buffalo patch and I was in the 371st infantry which I think was created in line with the various units of the Army that wore the buffalo patch.  So I did my training first at Fort Meade, Maryland, then at Camp [Fort] Wolters, Texas and then at Fort Huachuca, Arizona and went overseas with the 92nd.  In the summer of 1944, my wife [Lee Ella Wilson] and I married; this is the sixtieth year of our marriage.  We married on May 26th and I think by June I was on my way to Italy and we spent thirty days on the water, I remember one of the ships in our convoy was sunk on the way over by a German submarine.  We went to Iran, North Africa and then landed at Naples and then finally at Livorno [Italy] or Leg Horn, Italy where the 92nd division went into a staging area and then went from there to the front.  So it was an interesting experience, scary experience.  I prayed a lot (laughter).  I think I had my call to the ministry in the fox hole.  A lot of people say, "Oh that won't last long as soon as you get back you'll forget that but I promised God that I would serve him as a minister and never go back on my word and I haven't.  I pastored for a short time but I never left the ministry.  People ask you when you're teaching, "when are you going back to the ministry?" (Laughter).  I consider all of my life a ministry; I ministered as a teacher as well as as a pastor.
Story_ID: 192397
Speaker 1: And so you were able to complete your college education?
Speaker 2: Yes. Well, as a matter of fact, I went to the University of Florence in [Florence] Italy along with some other young men who wanted to finish their--get some college credits after the war [World War II, WWII] was over and then I came back with those credits and finished Lincoln University [Pennsylvania] with my B.A. degree and then went immediately into the seminary [Lincoln University, Pennsylvania] which was a three year graduate program leading to another bachelor's degree in divinity.  From there I went into the pastorate.  My first pastorate was with a small Presbyterian congregation in York, Pennsylvania which I served from 1946, or '45 [1945] to--almost to '47 [1947].  I guess I only served a couple of years and then in my last year which was 1947--).
Speaker 1: And can you tell us again where you served from 1945 to 1947?
Speaker 2: I'm mistaken those are my college years.  I graduated from college in 1947, I went to seminary in '47 [1947], September '47 [1947], in seminary in '47 [1947], '48 [1948] to '49 [1949], '49 [1949] to '50 [1950].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I graduated from seminary in '50 [1950] and served those congregations in '48 [1948] and '49 [1949].
Speaker 1: And where were those congregations again?
Speaker 2: The first one was in York, Pennsylvania; Faith Presbyterian Church in York, Pennsylvania which I went to every weekend, stayed over as a student pastor and then in 1949, I served a congregation of West Chester, Pennsylvania called the Second Presbyterian Church.  I went there as installed pastor, I was ordained into the ministry and went there as an installed pastor in 1950, right after graduation.
Speaker 1: And that was the same year you received your bachelor's of divinity?
Speaker 2: Yeah my bachelor's of divinity that same year and that summer my wife [Lee Ella Wilson] and I moved from Lincoln University with our two children into the manse as they called it of the Presbyterian church in West Chester.  That's another whole story, I won't get into but I was called a communist because I led a boycott of the--well I led the school integration movement in Westchester, Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: In 1949?
Speaker 2: In '49 [1949]--no in '50 [1950] and '51 [1951], '52 [1952], we integrated the elementary school system of West Chester and we were not very popular.  My son was the first black child to go to High Street School which was an elementary school nearest our home.  All the black kids are supposed to go to Gay Street School which was a black school on the other side of town.  So that was quite an experience.  I was supported in that by a lot of white people who were Quakers and other social radicals who lived in that area, you know, white people and blacks as well.
Story_ID: 192398
Speaker 1: When did you decide to leave the Communist Party, what age were you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I never joined the Communist Party as such but I stopped being involved in the Young Communist League as a student at Lincoln [University, Pennsylvania]--was it after coming back from the [U.S.] Army, yes I think after coming back from service.
Speaker 1: So in the mid-forties [1940s]?
Speaker 2: Yes--well I was discharged in 1945 so I went back to school in '45 [1945], yeah mid-forties.
Speaker 1: After you--how long did you stay in West Chester, Pennsylvania at that particular church?
Speaker 2: Three years.
Speaker 1: Three years; so from 1949 to 1952?
Speaker 2: No from 1949 to 1953, I guess because I'm counting the three years as an installed pastor, not as a student pastor.
Speaker 1: And also in 1953, you received your master's from Temple University [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Yes while I was pastoring I commuted into Philadelphia to Temple University and took the master of sacred theology.  Had no intention at that time of going on to the Ph.D., I just wanted to get a master's degree.
Story_ID: 192399
Speaker 1: One thing we didn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Later (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) talk about, Dr. [HM] Reverend Gayraud Wilmore, was what was your wife's [Lee Ella Wilson] reaction to your calling to the ministry?  Did she feel like I really hadn't signed up for this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 1: --or what was her reaction?
Speaker 2: She supported me all the way; she supported me all the way.  She was a good member of the Baptist church herself.  I met her in the 'Maskin Wiggers' [ph.] dramatic club and we started going together, oh I guess we went together five years before we got married in 1944.  But she never thought that I was going to be a minister.  I wrote her from Italy saying that I had this dramatic experience in combat and I had given my life to Christ as a minister and wanted to come home and go to seminary and she wrote and told me if that's what you want to do, I'm with you.
Story_ID: 192400
Speaker 1: Dr. [HistoryMaker Reverend Gayraud] Wilmore can you tell us a little about what happened in that foxhole that made you decide to dedicate your life to Christ through ministry?
Speaker 2: I don't talk about it very much because it's a mystery to me what happened.  It was in combat with shells bursting all around and we were stationary, we weren't moving forward anymore, we had stopped, we had been held up by German artillery and I remember being very afraid, very scared but I also remember praying and asking God to save me and I had a feeling of the presence of God with me in that foxhole.  A very keen acute feeling of his presence and at that time I committed myself to the ministry.  I told everybody about it afterward and some people said well you were just scared, you'll get over it and you won't feel that way.  We had one or two guys who were great cursors and warmongers and all that who changed under fire in combat.  Who really changed and became--prayers and wanted to chaplain and all that kind of thing and then when they got on the boat on the way back, they went right back to what they were before.
Speaker 1: But you didn't?
Speaker 2: I didn't.
Story_ID: 192401
Speaker 1: Dr. [HistoryMaker Reverend Gayraud] Wilmore after you left Second Presbyterian [Church, New York, New York] you began working with students in 1953.  Tell me a little about your work with the Mid-Atlantic student Christian movement?
Speaker 2: It was very interesting and very character building work.  I worked with young college students, mostly all white, I don't remember more than one or two blacks in it.  I travelled among colleges and universities in five states in the District of Columbia meeting with student Christian associations.  I taught bible, I lectured theology to them, I sat and discussion groups and led them, I took them on conferences.  I worked with a staff of four others all white.  The leader of the staff was Robert James [ph.] who was a congregational minister and he encouraged me while I was Second [Presbyterian] Church [West Chester, Pennsylvania] to think about the student Christian movement as a ministry and when we left the Second Church, we went to live next door to him and interracial-a new interracial cooperative housing project called Tanguy Homesteads.  We were the first black family to live in that community.  Bob was an excellent student minister, he really knew the ropes of what it takes to minister the students and I learned a lot.  I really became interested in theology more than ever before as a minister to students.
Speaker 1: And at that time, were you also becoming interested in teaching students as well?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 192402
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your first teaching position in 1959 with the Pittsburgh Theological Seminary [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]--
Speaker 2: I went to Pittsburgh Theological Seminary with the agreement that I would be working on my Ph.D. while teaching and they gave me the first year, as a matter of fact to stay in the doctoral program in which I started at Drew Theological Seminary in Madison, New Jersey.  In my second year of doctoral program I shifted to Temple University [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  They accepted my--I passed my languages and they accepted all of my credits and shift me into the doctoral program at Temple.  But the Civil Rights Movement was booming all around at that period in my life and two men came from New York, Reverend Bryant George and Reverend Dr. Edward Hawkins and asked me if I would set up for the Presbyterian church a national program in race relations in New York City [New York] and I couldn't resist it.  I knew I couldn't do the doctoral work then, I said well I'll do the doctoral work after this is over.  I said I'll give three years to this.  I promised the president of Pittsburgh Theological Seminary that if he would hold my position, I'd be back in three years to continue teaching, I'd have my degree--work on my degree, he agreed.  But three years that was 1963, '64 [1964], '65 [1965], '66 [1966].  That was at the zenith of the Movement.  We were trying to get up with [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.].  I was working in Hattiesburg, Mississippi and all over the South.
Story_ID: 192403
Speaker 1: What were some of your experiences (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I couldn't go [to Pittsburgh Theological Seminary] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) like working in the South ?
Speaker 2: It's hard to summarize it.  We organized freedom schools, we picketed, we taught people--helped people to register to vote in Hattiesburg, Mississippi.  I set up a project there; I didn't stay the whole time.  I went back and forth to New York [New York] and left a minister there--a white minister there to run the project.  But we set up a project that received ministers from the North for periods up to a month.  Most of them came for two or three weeks and many of them when they got back to their churches found they had no jobs because the sessions of the churches and the trustees fired them because they walked off and went into the [Civil Rights] Movement.  Some of the got arrested in Hattiesburg but we had a dormitory like place where they came and slept several in a room.  We got beds--put beds in there and a dining room in there.  So that's the kind of project--the Hattiesburg Ministers Project was.  We worked very closely with the Federation of--what was it called--COFO, C-O-F-O, Conference of Federated Organizations which included SNCC the Student Non Violent Coordinating Committee, SCLC the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Northern Student Movement and some other movements that--Mississippi Delta Program.  There were a number of programs in Mississippi that worked together under COFO.  The leader was Bob Moses who was a daring, young black teacher who came south to work with poor people and help in the desegregation effort.  I worked with [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] during that period as well.
Story_ID: 192404
Speaker 1: What was it like working with [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.]?
Speaker 2: Well it was interesting.  I did not work directly with him in the field but I was on the marches with him and I gave him a lot of money (laughter).  I raised a lot of money through our office in New York [New York] from this wealthy white Presbyterian church you see which had turned over a half million dollar budget to me and to other staff people to enter--to bring the church into the middle of the [Civil Rights] Movement and that's what we did.  So we gave money to King.
Speaker 1: Why was it important for the Presbyterian church to be part of the Civil Rights Movement?
Speaker 2: Because they had made many statements on paper that racial segregation was wrong, was a sin and this was putting their money where their mouth was.  In 1962 at a general assembly in Denver, Colorado they voted to create what they called the commission on religion and race and to set it in the inter church center in New York (unclear) for (unclear) and I was called to be the first director of that program, executive director.  I had a staff of three in those days.  One a Reverend Mezer Rollins [ph.] had been beaten on the line in the Movement down in Tallahassee, Florida and in Nashville, Tennessee.  So he was really a veteran of the Movement and he was my right hand man and Reverend Robert [J.] Stone, a white minister was also very influential in setting up the program in Mississippi.  I did that for nine years.
Story_ID: 192405
Speaker 1: Did you feel like this--that you needed to get back to teaching students in the classroom or that you wanted to?
Speaker 2: I was on the verge of being fired and I knew it.  I got involved with [HM] Angela Davis and the defense of Angela Davis.  We gave a lot of money to Angela Davis for her defense.  She was a black woman, Communist and the Presbyterian church went up in arms about it and they were after my throat, I knew they were going to get me.  So I resigned, I was invited by Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] to take the chair-the Martin Luther King chair that had been occupied by another Presbyterian minister, Preston Williams.  Preston went to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and I went to Boston University under fire, under fire.
Speaker 1: Did you resent the Presbyterian church for not supporting you?
Speaker 2: No because the liberals in the Presbyterian church supported me, the northern Presbyterian church supported me but it was the conservative wing of that church, the lay people not the clergy.  The lay people back in the local congregations who said we've got to get rid of this program and this man who supported Angela Davis this black woman Communist gave our money--$10,000 to her.  I gave them back the $10,000 and then raise it from black clergy, ten black clergy gave a $1,000 each and we said this is our contribution to the defense of Angela Davis not that other money.
Speaker 1: Do you regret your involvement with Angela Davis (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, I don't regret it at all, I think that was the right thing to do and I was supported by my colleagues white and black.  I wanted to teach, of course I wanted to go back to teaching and all the time I had planned to, you know.
Speaker 1: The timing was just right.
Speaker 2: I had so much to teach then.  You see I had nine years in the field so I said I must get the young ministers and give them the benefit of this experience.  I taught social ethics and that was--made it possible for me to talk about the civil rights movement, my experiences with the movement and what was necessary for the church to take the leadership that it ought to take with respect to desegregation.
Story_ID: 192406
Speaker 1: From there [the Presbyterian church in New York, New York] you went on to teach black church studies at Colgate [Rochester Crozer Divinity School, Rochester, New York].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was that experience like for you?
Speaker 2: Well I had the [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] chair at Boston University School of Theology [Boston, Massachusetts] so naturally I was doing a lot of work about [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] on the Civil Rights Movement.  So I naturally moved into black history because you can't deal with social ethics and Christian ethics, you know, without talking about history.  So I began to study history on my own and when I went to Colgate Rochester, they put me in the history department.  So I started teaching African American religious history and black church history and I did that for nine years there and enjoyed it.  It was a great experience.
Speaker 1: What were some of the things that you taught your students about black church studies?
Speaker 2: Well my purpose was to acquaint students with the history of Christianity among African Americans and the history actually begins in Africa and in those early days I did not know that.  I did not put any emphasis on that.  I was really not tied into Afrocentrism and the movement that exists today that emphasizes the history of African people.  So I talked about the slave church, I talked about the church during the Emancipation period and the church in the Reconstruction period.  I taught them that the church was a lot more radical in the 1850s before the civil war than it was in the beginning of the 19th century, the First World War [WWI, World War I].
Speaker 1: How so, a lot more radical how?
Speaker 2: Well because of the work of the abolitionist, the abolition of slavery was a great mission for the black church and therefore the black church was the radical church of that period.  I wrote a book, instead of doing a PhD dissertation called 'Black Religion and Black Radicalism' ['An Interpretation of the Religious History of African Americans,' Gayraud S. Wilmore] which laid out all of that history plus the history of the Movement that I had participated in, in the '60s [1960s].  So that was the kind of thing I was teaching young men and women who were going into the Christian ministry with the hope that they would bring that kind of perspective into the way they ministered, what they preached, what they taught, how they led their people in trying to change the world especially the black community where their churches existed.  And I think as I look back some of them did that and I'm very proud of some of them who carried that into their own ministries.
Story_ID: 192407
Speaker 1: Did you teach some well--some students who are now well known and have very familiar names?
Speaker 2: No none of them are very--have great names or for wealth.  Padre Spencer [ph.] who is one who stays very close to me is at Concord Baptist Church [Brooklyn, New York] where [HM Reverend] Gardner Taylor was pastor and he is an associate pastor there.  He, I think is well known in Brooklyn, New York but none of them have been great writers or teachers themselves.  If I stop to think about--oh one Turner wrote a Festschrift celebrating my life in ministry called 'Dissent and Empowerment' ['Essays in Honor of Gayraud S. Wilmore,' Gayraud S. Wilmore and Eugene G. Turner] and he reached very high levels in the Presbyterian church, now retired, his name is Eugene Turner and he lives in Schenectady, New York, I taught him.  I guess he was probably the best known of my students.
Speaker 1: And what is it that you hope of all the hundreds or thousands of students that you've taught?
Speaker 2: Would be scores, baby (laughter).
Speaker 1: What is it that you hope that they have gained?  What is the most important thing that you want them to come away from, someone who studies under you?
Speaker 2: That the black church represents a distinctive forum of Christianity, has a distinctive history and theology that emphasizes human liberation and that to be a pastor in the black church means to see Jesus Christ as liberator, as one who calls for social justice.  The liberation of people from poverty and oppression and therefore ones ministry ought to be a leader of people to change the circumstance under which they live, that's what I tried to emphasize in both my writings and my teaching.
Story_ID: 192408
Speaker 1: Where did you enjoy teaching the most?
Speaker 2: I didn't teach any black seminaries until I went to Atlanta [Georgia] and there I was called by James Costen to whom this book is dedicated that I just showed you. James Costen(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And this was in 1987, right?
Speaker 2: Yes he was at that time the dean of the Presbyterian entity at the Interdenominational Theological Center [ITC, Atlanta, Georgia].  That's composed of several denominational seminaries and also part of the complex of Atlanta University [later, Clark-Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] and he asked me if I would come down, I was thinking about retirement in those days and he said why don't you retire here in Atlanta rather than in New York and help me for a few years, I said okay.  So I went down to Atlanta--we moved to Atlanta and I think I enjoyed that experience more than any other because the white theological seminaries, although they had given me an opportunity to build programs of African American religious studies had never integrated that program the way I wanted it to be integrated with the regular curriculum.  But at ITC, you know, with predominantly black students, black faculty, I was able to spread my wings so to speak and do a lot more than I could at Colgate Rochester [Crozer Divinity School, Rochester, New York].  Even at New York Theological Seminary [NYTS] [New York, New York] and New York Theological Seminary was predominantly black in my days.  I came there to be dean of the M.Div. [Master of Divinity] program.  So I got its accreditation as a theological seminary, give me that degree which was quite an accomplishment that I'm very happy about and then I taught men and women who were a little older than those that I had at Colgate Rochester  and at the Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] who were working in secular work and then came to school at night and on Saturdays on weekends to get their Master of Divinity degree, M.Div.  So that was a good experience and my first real encounter with larger numbers of black students who were older and who had experience in the world that they could use to make contact with the teaching that I was giving.  So the years at NYTS and at Atlanta at the ITC were my best years, I think, my best teaching years.
Story_ID: 192409
Speaker 1: Also during the '90s [1990s], you began--well you never stopped your writing.  You always continued to write and have written and/or edited sixteen books.  Are any of those more dear to you than or what are (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I liked the first one which is out of print the 'Secular Relevance of the Church' [Gayraud S. Wilmore] which was my first book, should have been my doctoral dissertation; I guess if I had stayed in that work.  But I liked it because it opened up the idea that the despite its holiness and its biblical centered orientation the church was a secular institution in terms of what its goals and its purposes were.  Liberation, the liberation of the poor, ministry to the oppressed, dealing with politics and economics and social work, you know, and housing and jobs, all those secular things were a part of the ministry that Jesus Christ called us to.  I wanted to say to the church don't be so holy and so separate from the world that you don't get an opportunity or you don't take the opportunity to make Christ a living savior in the field of politics and economics and social work generally.
Speaker 1: And do you think that the church is challenged with that today?  Do you think the church is still--has that same mission in mine today when you look at the black church in general?
Speaker 2: I think so if you're talking about the leadership of the church, I've been doing some work for the A.M.E.s [American Methodist Episcopal Church] recently and I know that that is the concern of Bishop Vinton Anderson whose book I edited and that's a concern of other leaders of the black church.  I don't think the people in the pew have been taught enough about this theological perspective and this mission of the church.  During the civil rights period we were more involved in that kind of mission.  But since the death of [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.], I think both the white and the black church have retrenched and stepped back from that forward movement of social change that Dr. King represented and that my own teaching emphasized.
Speaker 1: Does that disappoint you?
Speaker 2: I'm too realistic I guess to be disappointed.  I know that we live in a sinful world, a fallen world.  We have a constant job of trying to change the world by changing people and changing institutions.  I don't get discouraged, I'm optimistic and I continue to work and urge other people to work because I believe God is working also along with us.
Speaker 1: In many of things that I've read about you, one thing comes out a lot and I just want to know what your thoughts are when I read this to you, 'hard toward life, humble toward God' would that be your favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes it would be one.  I think we need always to be humble and modest in our aspirations and our sense of ourselves and how we look to others and how we look to God because none of us are profitable as servants, you know, we're all our righteousness is as filthy rags, as the scripture says.  But I think we ought to always be hardnosed about the world in which we live and always ready to praise others rather than ourselves and to urge others to take seriously this world we live in.  Where'd you get that statement? I'd be interested to know?
Speaker 1: In several things (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In one of my books?
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) several things that I've read about you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(Simultaneous) Oh--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) people have used that phrase (simultaneous.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh have said that, oh.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, right.
Speaker 2: Oh I see, I didn't know that you picked that out then.
Speaker 1: Yes sir.

Speaker 1: Dr. [HistoryMaker Reverend Gayraud] Wilmore one thing we didn't talk about that we perhaps should is when you were a boy an incident that occurred with your neighbor and the fence, can you tell us a little bit about that?
Speaker 2: Yes that happened on Jefferson Street [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] and I believe we had a white neighbor and when we moved into that house the white neighbor put an extension on the fence in the backyard so that we couldn't look over there and he couldn't look over and see our black faces.  It was a sore spot for him and for us.  We didn't speak, we had nothing to do with each other, it was tension.  We, I guess were among a very few black families that moved into that block and one day a young woman that he had married, I think he was a policeman, one day the woman's baby had something wrong with him--wrong with the child.  Colitis is that something baby's have?  I don't know a coughing spell or something got caught in the child's throat.  So she didn't know what to do so she rang the doorbell and my mother [Patricia Gardner Wilmore] who was from Virginia and knew all about raising children, went in there and did something to the baby and whatever it was came out, phlegm or something and the baby was alright and the woman went back--thanked her and went back in the house.  When her husband came home from work she told him what had happened and he went out there with a hatchet and chopped down that fence.  I used to use it occasionally to talk about how being a good neighbor can break down barriers between black and white.  But you bringing it up now just kind of shocked me a little because I haven't thought it for a long, long time but that's that story.
Speaker 1: Did it break barriers in your--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: It didn't change the relationship a great deal but we did then begin to at least recognize one and other and speak to one and other.  And the very fact that he took that symbol of our estrangement down, he really wanted to have some kind of relationship.  But my father [Gayraud S. Wilmore, Sr.] as I told you was a hardnosed guy himself, was involved in a lot of movements and organizations, he didn't take time to make friends with this guy.
Speaker 1: And do you use a lot of your past experiences in your sermons?
Speaker 2: No I don't, I try to use the scripture; I stay with the scripture pretty much.  I talk about current things, I try and talk about present day but I feel a little--I don't feel free to use a lot of my personal experiences in my sermons 'cause it sounds like you're talking about yourself rather than about Christ who is really the object of everything we say in a sermon, you know.
Story_ID: 192411
Speaker 1: When the Black Power movement started, you see.  Black Power started around 1965 out of the [James] Meredith March and [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King's [Jr.] failure in Chicago [Illinois].  Out of that came a northern movement of black clergy which was more radical than King. Some people would have said that it was a violent movement.  It wasn't violent, but it was a movement that wanted to emphasize the ethnicity--the ethnic identity of African Americans; the history of African Americans as contributive to our strong concern about justice and our demand that the academy--the white academy recognize this history and this philosophical or theological perspective that came out of the black church.  When I was in Colgate Rochester [Crozer Divinity School, Rochester, New York], the students had just come through a rebellion against the faculty and administration because of the lack of teaching about African American religion and about the black church.  They locked themselves up in the administration building and for several days ministers in the community fed them through buckets that were let down from windows.  They really took over at campus and stopped everything until they were promised a Martin Luther King professorship and a greater emphasis upon black church history and greater involvement of the school itself and the work of justice in the African American community of Rochester.  Well I came at that time and so I was a part of that new emphasis upon black studies in theology.  That was already going on in the college issue, though; just beginning I guess during King's--the latter part of King's ministry.  But when I went to New York [New York], it was at its height after I had gone to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  I went to New York, it was at its height and while I was directing the commission on religion and race of the Presbyterian Church, I helped to organize a group called the National Committee of Black Churchmen, NCBC and that group published a long statement in the New York Times and in the Los Angeles Times on Black Power--a theological meaning of Black Power.  It spelled Black Power out from the perspective of those who believed in Jesus Christ and from the perspective of the church, what were we after, who were we, why were we emphasizing blackness or the identity of black people as being important to give pride and self-esteem to our children, young people in this struggle.  We also organized a group called The Society for the Study of Black Religion in 1970 and that organization is still in existence.  I've been president of it, I am one of the past presidents and it is made up of men and women who are teaching in universities and theological seminaries in the field of African American religious studies in Bible and history, theology and so forth.  So it's a very important part of my life, a very important movement in academia.  I haven't said very much about it in this interview but we could talk more about it if you'd like.
Story_ID: 192412
Speaker 1: Why is it so important to you?
Speaker 2: Because I think the white church and white Christianity generally has not acknowledged the importance of Africa and the development of Christianity nor the importance of the African American church in radicalizing the social gospel to make it more pragmatic in terms of changing America, changing the world.  Until they acknowledge that they are not teaching the truth as far as I'm concerned.  I'm very happy that we had out there now a gaudery of men and women younger than I who came up under us who are teaching, young ministers coming out the history of the black church and its importance in terms of what happened in the civil war and after civil reconstruction and what happened in the Civil Rights Movement.  [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.], in other words, stood on the shoulders of the men and women of that earlier period and we need to know that, recognize it and celebrate it.
Speaker 1: And what do you say to those who say it's really not their responsibility to teach this, theirs is to minister the word of Christ?
Speaker 2: Well there are some I guess who feel that way very few who have studied under me would say that, I guess, they wouldn't take my courses if they were that conservative.  You asked me what would I say to them?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I would say to them that Jesus Christ himself was involved in ministry to the outcast and sinners, eating with sinners, moving among people doing good.  Therefore social justice is central to the ministry of the church and if all you're doing is standing up on Sunday and praising the Lord and clapping and stomping your feet and singing gospel songs, you are not in my estimation following the ministry.  You're not imitating the ministry of Christ who fed the hungry, who preached liberation to the poor.
Story_ID: 192413
Speaker 1: When you look back at your life, Dr. [HistoryMaker Reverend Gayraud] Wilmore, what stands out the most and why?
Speaker 2: What stands out the most?  I guess my ministry to students stands out the most and along those lines that I've just indicated.  Those are my happiest days, those were my days when I felt most fulfilled and as I look out at the church today, I can see places where that my teaching and the teaching of others particularly my collaborator the one [HM] James [H.] Cone of Union Theological Seminary in New York [New York] and others with whom I've worked.  Society for the Study of Black Religion [SSBR], I can see evidences of that ministry here and there in the church.  Not as much as I would like, I'm somewhat disappointed that it did not take as widely and as deeply as it should and I think that is because black religion itself is strongly emotional and a lot of people go to church for entertainment.  They like the singing and they like the loud, you know, fervent preaching.  When a crisis comes along they'll get together and work, you know, they'll walk picket lines like they did in Montgomery, Alabama.  They walked, you know, rather than ride segregated buses but when a crisis--when it's not a critical period, when no great crisis is going on, they are apt to make their religion a eleven o'clock, Sunday morning religion and not one that is seeking to lift people and change conditions under which people live especially poor people.
Story_ID: 192414
Speaker 1: In your opinion what should every pastor or every minister's goal be on Sunday or at sermon time, what should the goal be?
Speaker 2: I think to lift up Jesus Christ as the oppressed man of God who in Isaiah is recognized as being despised and rejected by men but who himself identified with the poor and the wretched of the earth and ministered to them and whose death and life--death and resurrection it seems to me ought to be an inspiration to all of us to follow in his tracks.
Speaker 1: Do you ever wish you would have chosen a different career path that perhaps pursuing your dream of becoming a newspaper man or do you ever wish you had chosen a different career path?
Speaker 2: No, I never have felt I was on the wrong track because I think the Lord is with me every day with my wife.  We know where we've been and we think the Lord led us there and is leading us now.  So I've never regretted or never thought that I missed the boat somewhere along the way.  I'm writing and my writings sustains me in that feeling because, you know, this new book ['Pragmatic Spirituality: The Christian faith through an Africentric lens,' Gayraud S. Wilmore] I've written is a book of my published writings--most of my published writings for almost forty years and as you can see the development of my thinking in it.  So I think I've done what God wanted me to do.
Speaker 1: And what do you think your dad [Gayraud S. Wilmore, Sr.] the aspiring writer would think about all of your writings and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah I think Dad knows that I have been greatly influenced by him and I've carried his dream to fulfillment.  He wanted to see his name in print, Wilmore name is in print (laughter).  Although I'm not a publisher of a newspaper, I think I've got enough books out there that he would be very proud and very happy.
Story_ID: 192415
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: I do not think that African American institutions ought to go out of existence.  There are some people who say well we're integrated now and we don't need a black church or we don't need black colleges, and universities and black organizations and so forth.  I'm not one who thinks that.  I think that our heritage from the past is worth preserving at least through the 21st century.  I recognize the fact that we're moving toward a multicultural society not only in America but all over the world.  There's going to be much more interracial marriages in the next hundred years.  Ethnicity will prove to less important to people 200, 300 years from now but I think that black people and their experiences both in Africa and in the United States is a precious gift that God has given to the world in terms of how to live and how to--what to work for, how to liberate people and how to regard one's life and one's relationship to God, you know.  That quotation that you gave me is the black--as W. E. B. Du Bois would say is a black gift to the world.  He talked about our gift of music, of labor and of thinking and action for freedom and righteousness in the world, and I agree.  So I think our black community ought to go on being a part of this country, a part of America but also deep concern about Africa and its future and ought to represent Africa's concerns before the legislatures or the Congress of the United States.  I sorry that we're not more involved in Africa than we are, we were involved in the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, but we need now to be involved in the development of Africa as a democracy--as democratic states in Africa and get rid of that terrible tendency toward genocidal warfare between tribes that's going on in Africa today.  So as I think of the future, I think of African Americans in Africa in closer relationship and going on to be a gift to America emphasizing freedom and liberation as goals for democratic societies.
Story_ID: 192416
Speaker 1: Why do you think history is important?
Speaker 2: Well because I think God has worked with us in the past and when we look at history, we see the ways in which God has worked with us and we learn how to avoid mistakes in the future although we sometimes make those same mistakes over and over again.  But when you look into the history of African Americans in this country, you see a lot of lessons there, you know.  The strength that our people have, the endurance, the perseverance, the hope of the future, the belief that we'll make it one day, we'll break through these barriers and be fulfilled as human beings.  When you see all of those things, then you know that to bring our children up without knowing that background is to rob them of a great deal of the inspiration that comes out of our past.  So we need to teach black history and we need to see the church as very central to that history.
Story_ID: 192417
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered Dr. [HistoryMaker Reverend Gayraud Wilmore] Gilmore [sic, Wilmore]?
Speaker 2: As a Wilmore (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Wilmore--
Speaker 2: I would like to remembered as a writer, as a historian, theologian who urged black folk not to be completely submerged in the thinking of the white church and the white community but to think for themselves and to discover that special calling and relationship to God that they have to help America realize its highest ideals.
Story_ID: 192418
Speaker 1: And what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Well I guess my children, my books but my children, I think are going to go on and do things that I will be proud of and my grandchildren.  I have now two great grandchildren, a little boy and a little girl.  I hope and pray that they will find out something about me and about us as Wilmores and carried that into the future.  I don't have any money to leave them, all I have are ideas and books and my own love for the church and for African American people.

Speaker 1: As you know I've done a lot of lecturing and preaching around the country and all over the world as a matter of fact, so this is one of my pictures that I sent out to hosts who are inviting me to come to preach or lecture.
Speaker 2: About what year?
Speaker 1: About 1993, I think just after my retirement.  This is a picture of myself just after I was discharged from the [U.S.] Army in 1945 in my mother's [Patricia Gardner Wilmore] backyard with my first son, Stephen Wilmore.  I'm on the right and this is an early picture in 1940s just--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Nineteen forty-six.
Speaker 1: Nineteen forty-six, the others I don't recognize, I can't tell you who they are maybe neighbors or relatives.
Speaker 2: But this is you?
Speaker 1: Yes I'm on the right hand side.
Speaker 2: What year was that one taken Dr. [HM Reverend Gayraud] Wilmore?
Speaker 1: This is taken almost the same time as the other one we looked at.  This one is in early '90s [1990s] maybe 1995.  This picture was taken when I was teaching in Rochester, New York in the '80s [1980s] and I'm leading a group of people who are boycotting at a picketing bank that was investing in South Africa.  This picture was taken in London, England.  I did some teaching over there at North Hampton College which is a black college of the New Testament Church of God.
Speaker 2: What year?
Speaker 1: In the 1970s.
Speaker 2: Okay 1978.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my wife [Lee Ella Wilson] and Allen Boesak  who came to study with me at Colgate Rochester.  He was one of the leaders of the liberation movement that brought down apartheid in South Africa.
Speaker 2: And this one was taken in 1978?
Speaker 1: Yes I'm at Colgate Rochester [Crozer Divinity School, Rochester, New York], but I took a trip to Africa and there I am at the University of Kampala in Uganda with the leading African theologian, John S. Mbiti.
Speaker 2: Would you spell Mbiti?
Speaker 1: M-B-I-T-I
Speaker 2: In 1978?
Speaker 1: Yes. This is a book signing at ITC [Interdenominational Theological Center, Atlanta, Georgia].  I think the book is 'Black and Presbyterian' [Gayraud S. Wilmore] which is still in print.  One of my books written for the African American constituency of the Presbyterian Church at the Interdenominational Theological Center in 1998.  This is a recent picture of myself and my wife who was quite ill during that time and this year in 2004 thank God she is much better now but that's a picture we took together.  This is a class that I taught in 1983 which I believe was my first year at Colgate Rochester Divinity School.  I had just left Rochester, New York.  Some of these are ministers now.  This is the same group.  I recognize some of those as ministers.  One of them is now the president of New York Theological Seminary; that was taken in 1983.
