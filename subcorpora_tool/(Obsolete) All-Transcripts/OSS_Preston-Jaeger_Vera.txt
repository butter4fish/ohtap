 Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  My name is Jerry Gill. Today is July 30, 2009. I   m visiting with Vera  Preston-Jaeger on the Oklahoma State University campus in Stillwater,  Oklahoma. This interview is for the O-STATE Stories project, which is  part of the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Vera, thank you  for being with us. I know you   re from a famous OSU family. Former  President Henry G. Bennett was your grandfather. So we   re looking  forward to interviewing you a little bit about your life, and also maybe  reflecting and looking at Dr. Bennett, what you remember about him, as  well.  Yes.  Could you share a little bit of information with us about your early life,  where you grew up, a little bit about your family life?  I grew up in Stillwater, Oklahoma and I graduated from Oklahoma State  University. I got my master   s degree at the University of Maine, in  mathematics, my Ph.D. in mathematics education at the University of  Texas at Austin. I went into the Peace Corps in 1962 and was there from     62 to    64. We, all of the people training to go to the Peace Corps in the  Washington D.C. area were invited to John F. Kennedy   s East Lawn at  the White House, with maybe a thousand or more that showed up, in the  summer of 1962.  Could you share your brothers and sisters, a little bit about your family  life, what you remember about your immediate family?  I   m the oldest. I have three sisters, Patricia Ann Preston (Tricia), Trula  Gwyn Preston-Daughtery, and Libby Lee Preston-Bethel. We lived out  north of town but when I was little we lived on Ramsey. Then I  remember living on Husband Street near Boomer Lake and lived there  when Tricia was born. And then we moved to Adams Street and while  6  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  we were still there, I had a brother who died when he was four months  old. Then we moved out north of town, six miles north. Then, after my  grandparents died in the plane crash in Tehran, not exactly immediately,  but we moved into Stillwater and lived on McElroy at the corner of  McElroy and Monroe from the time we moved there, the summer before  I went into junior high, and that   s where we lived when Trula and Libby  were born.  Vera, what did your father do for a living?  He started out working for the  Soil Conservation Service . His office  was on the campus at OSU. He was an agronomist, one of three  agronomists in the Navy in World War II. And then he went into  insurance and he still farmed and ranched. Then he started building  houses and was in real estate and insurance when he died. He died while  I was in the Peace Corps in 1963.  Was Preston Street named for him?  Yes. Preston  Drive  was named after him and Liberty  Lane  was  named after my mother. He built a lot of houses.  Your mother   s name was Liberty?  Liberty Loven Bennett Preston, yes.  Referred to as Libby?  Well, my sister Libby is Libby. My mother was Liberty, but she was  called Libby by a lot of her friends.  Did your mother work in the home or did she work outside the home?  She worked in the home and was very active in the community. I  remember handing out League of Women voters information on Main  Street of Stillwater, Oklahoma and lots of areas of town when I was, I  don   t know, eight or nine. She organized a group at the hospital for  volunteering at the hospital. When my father died, she got her realtor   s  license and insurance licenses and ran the business that my father had  had.  What values and lessons did you learn that helped shape you growing up  and influenced your life?  My grandmother and grandfather were both very active in the Baptist  church. I went to Sunday School  with  my mother and father. I  7  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  remember my grandmother really having serious discussions with me.  When you consider that I was nine years old when they died, it is  amazing because she would talk about helping people and living your  faith and being kind and considerate to others and having a purpose in  life where you   re always helping. It was very important to her that I be  baptized. In the Baptist church you are baptized when you make the  decision, not when someone else does. I remember that my father and I  both joined the church to be baptized one evening worship service the  year that my grandparents died.  As I recall it was in the Fall, but it was after they had left on the trip  where they ended up dying in the plane crash in Tehran. And that was  very important to me. I believe I had written her, but to know that I had  been baptized before she died, that was a big deal to me. But it was  amazing and she told me about missionaries and we read the Bible and  talked about it. My mother read the Bible to me, the stories in it, every  night before I went to bed, the Hulbert   s Children   s Bible with the bible  stories. But the real emphasis was in always being thoughtful and kind  and considerate and that all people were important. The fact that they  had black friends, or Negroes at the time, now it   s African Americans.  But they had friends who were Native Americans so they were my  friends, they were my grandparents.  This is your grandparents we   re talking about.  And then my mother. We had friends who came to our house, we went  to theirs, who were different Native American tribes. There were blacks  that were our friends that we would go visit them and they would come.  And now I realize that wasn   t the norm in that time of our country. I  remember asking my mother,    Why are there separate water fountains?  This isn   t fair.    I was very aware of unfairness. It was interesting. I  thought everyone was like that. But I remember spending the nights with  my grandmother and grandfather   I mean sometimes he was there,  sometimes he was on trips. And knowing that we needed to help other  people was very important.  Vera, you picked up on something I wanted to ask you about. Your  grandfather and your grandmother, you indicated, were very close to  you and very special to you and you indicated that you visited there  occasionally. Can you share some of your memories about the  presidential home? This would   ve been in the    40s, I guess?  Yes. Yes, I was born in    42 and spent a lot of time there during World  War II. At some period of World War II, we were living with  Grandmother and Granddaddy. And then I remembered that we also  lived in Pensacola, Florida. Just so you know, I   m not sure the sequence  8  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  of this. But I remember my grandmother, when we were living with  them, my mother and I, and I woke up from a nap and my mother wasn   t  around. My grandmother said that my mother was canning with other  people someplace else in Stillwater and that she   d be home soon. Well,  my father had gone away and he hadn   t come home soon so she ended  up having to take me to see where my mother was and open the door and  there were all these women canning in this big room. I sat under my  mother   s table. I would not go home with my grandmother. (Laughter) I  remember they had tiger lilies, the flowers, at the end there where the  road curves on the property where the President   s house was.  Husband Street.  I remember playing in the yard under the trees and everything and then I  would go to see Granddaddy at his office and would play under his desk  while he was busy working.  Did he encourage that or is that sort of unusual for his toddler  granddaughter to be in the president   s office?  Well, now I think it   s amazing. I knew the secretaries and they were my  good friends and I knew his phone number was 201. This was when you  picked up the phone and an operator asked,    Who do you want to talk  to? Number please.    And I would say,    201,    and I would call my  grandfather. Of course, now as an adult, (laughter) I realize that not  everyone calls the President of the University. My grandfather never  seemed rushed. He was always accepting and talked to me. It was  amazing as I look back.  Knowing all the responsibilities and projects he had going on that he  always took time to visit with you?  Yes, I mean that it was just,    Oh yes, you can come over and play. Just  be quiet while I   m working.    (Laughter) So it was a lot of fun and the  whole area of campus was just kind of my little playground area.  I want to ask you some more questions about President Bennett, but I  want to back up. What do you remember about the presidential home?  You were there, you said actually your family lived there when you were  very young.  Yes, well it was two stories and a basement. I remember going down  into the basement and that   s where they had the washing machine, which  was the old kind where you run through the ringer and put the clothes  through in this thing that you put through. Sometimes I almost would get  my hand stuck in it as I would help. And then from the upstairs there  9  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  was a laundry chute that went from the upstairs   right outside the  bathroom there was this chute and you   d put your dirty clothes there and  they would go and end up in the basement. So a number of us, and  probably my mother when they were little, I don   t remember that I did.  I think I conned my sister into doing it. But anyway, going down the  laundry chute into the basement (laughter) and landing, fortunately  landing on dirty clothes. That was all your fall was broken by. (Laughs)  There were bedrooms up there and there was like a sleeping porch  because we didn   t have air conditioning. When it was really hot, you  could go out and sleep on the sleeping porch and it was screened in. I  think Granddaddy had an office upstairs also, I can   t remember. Then  downstairs you had an area, there was a big long living room, but at one  end it was like a music room. It was a doorway, but it wasn   t a door, and  so they had a piano and a harp there. And then in the living room there  was a fireplace and I remember many times when it was winter and that  was the only warm place in the house was in front of the fire, so we were  all sitting near it. I was sitting on the floor watching the fire and playing  with blocks. My mother and grandmother and grandfather were there  talking. There was a very large dining room. With the family being there  all together for meals there was probably twenty people and sitting in it  was formal dining. There was Dora,  she  was the woman who worked  for Grandmother and Granddaddy and cooked, brought the food in. But  it was always very formal so I learned how to eat very formally and  behave.  China and silverware.  The china and all of the different utensils. I remember once one of my  cousins was scooting up to the table, but they had the plate kind of  overlapped and she hit that as she   s pulling up to the table. It was a  domino effect of you pushed the plate a little bit and then the water glass  falls over. (Laughs) You remember funny things.  I understand from visiting with other people that frequently there were  visitors there that would dine also. If someone was there they were  invited to dinners. Is that right, do you remember?  Yes, yes there was always room for someone to just show up. You  always had enough. And my mother tells stories of people always  coming to visit them and that when the people came if they needed more  beds then the children, my mother   s generation, would be sleeping in the  bathtub or on the floor somewhere else because the guest, whoever  showed up, got the beds. I remember my grandmother having teas and  wearing a long dress and going to the teas that my grandmother would  have in the house. So I went to a lot of things as a child that now I  10  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  realize not everyone else was going to. (Laughs)  Vera, you were a grandchild, but were there other grandchildren who   d  be your cousins and sisters and brothers that also would be there at the  house frequently?  Well, my Uncle Henry and Uncle Phil lived in Oklahoma City and so  they would come always sometime around Christmas and always at  Thanksgiving. The big Christmas meal wasn   t necessarily on Christmas  day. It was just whenever everyone could be there. But I remember in  the backyard they had the white chairs, I can   t remember the name of  them, but we would all be sitting out in the backyard. The adults were  sitting, the children were playing. So I grew up playing with my cousins  when they would come to Stillwater. My Aunt Mary and Uncle Mack  and their children also were living in Stillwater. Uncle Tommy was  working at the Pentagon at one point. So I got to be with my cousins a  lot because Uncle Tommy moved back to Oklahoma and moved to  Oklahoma City, so then they were closer and I would see them.  So there were always a lot of grandkids around the house?  Yes, a lot of children, a lot of parties in the backyard. My mother would  have birthday parties there sometimes when I was little. So it was a  wonderful home. It was wonderful to be in the same town with  Grandmother and Granddaddy. I remember when the Student Union first  opened, after they built the Student Union she took me to the restaurant  there and she would take me to plays and concerts. And considering the  age I was when they died, I went to a lot of different things. I remember  she took me and my mother to eat at the Skirvin Tower Hotel in  Oklahoma City. They had the little finger bowls to clean your hands  between courses. That was just the way that was, where I went with my  grandmother.  Stepping back one step, I might ask, what stories do you remember from  your mother telling when she was a child growing up? Do you  remember some of her favorite stories, what she remembered about her  family life and her mom and dad?  Well, before they moved to Stillwater they were in Durant. My  grandparents met in Hugo, Oklahoma where she was a teacher at the  school where he was a principal and then the superintendent at Hugo.  Then one of the stories is that he would go from Durant or maybe from  Hugo, he would take the train to Oklahoma City for meetings and things  and once when he was President, I think he was already President of the  college in Durant, he was on the train with whatever snacks and  everything that Grandmother had made for him for the trip. He got to  11  talking to another person on the train. I don   t remember who that was,  but in talking with him, with Granddaddy, talking with this person, the  person was from New York and he offered to help pay for Granddaddy  to get his doctorate at Colombia University in New York City. When  Granddaddy got back to Durant he told my grandmother that he   d met  this person, whom I should remember the name, but I don   t, and that he  had offered to help Granddaddy go to Colombia and get his doctorate.  My grandfather said,    But you know, we have all these children and I  don   t see how this will work.    My grandmother said,    This is a  wonderful opportunity. You go and get your doctorate. I will take care  of the children and they   ll be fine.     He got his doctorate in one year and he had to have so many copies of  his dissertation to present to the committee and defend his dissertation.  There wasn   t much time. It was due the next day. There was a  timeframe. He was very creative in solving problems. He went to a  school where people were learning how to type and had them type his  dissertation. (Laughter) He had it ready in time. So that was very  interesting.  So that story and I know that when Granddaddy   they moved here when  my mother was ten or eleven, to Oklahoma A M College. The faculty  did not like him. When he first got here, they already didn   t like him and  he knew that, so he had a meeting with all of the teachers, all of the  faculty. They were really up in arms. I don   t remember the issues at this  point, so the people weren   t real welcoming when they first moved here.  But after that first meeting with all of the faculty, he won most or all of  them at that point so that they could go on and do what needed to be  done.  But one of the stories I   ve heard from someone I guess who was there, a  lot of people running for governor would say the first thing they were  going to do was    get rid of Dr. Henry G. Bennett as President of  Oklahoma A M College.    (Laughs) One of those times and maybe  every time, but one of the times that someone that was their campaign  promise, Granddaddy met with this person and by the time the  discussion was over, the person who had said the first thing he would do     would be to fire Dr. Henry G. Bennett    was Dr. Henry G. Bennett   s  friend. (Laughter) So he was very good.  My mother remembers that Grandmother would have 3 by 5 cards and it  would have a person   s name on it, the name of the wife, and all the  children and maybe all of their birthdays for all I know (laughs) and  what they like to eat and everything about them that they knew. As they  would be going places, she would read him the information to remind  him. They were very people oriented. It was very important to give  12  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  people the opportunity to get an education. I remember my mother  saying that her father was the first mail carrier in Arkadelphia, I think,  Arkansas. He got that job because his father had a horse. (Laughs) But  he would study as he was riding the horse and delivering the mail, he  would be reading. So he was from a family that valued education and  wanted everyone else to.  Trying to get a sense of Henry G. Bennett, the family man, did your  mother ever tell you stories about what kind of a father he was? And I  know he was good father, but memories she has of her home life and her  mother and her father. Do you recall any stories she shared with you?  The main thing was that he just always had time to spend with the  children. No matter how busy he was, when he was President of the  college in Durant or Oklahoma State, it was just that he was always a  caring father and very supportive of what they wanted to do.  Did she remember any special family trips or activities? Are there some  activities as a family they did together?  Well, when they went any place, they would take cousins, so it   s very  family-oriented and they   d have to take two cars. Uncle Henry started  driving at a young age I guess because I think Grandmother and  Granddaddy would stay in the same car and Uncle Henry would drive.  But maybe before Grandmother would drive they were driving  somewhere and they came to a river. There was a car with a couple of  women in it and they were trying to decide because the water was going  over the bridge. So Grandmother and Granddaddy and Uncle Henry,  whoever was driving the two cars with all of the five children and  cousins and whoever else they picked up I guess, they went across and  then the next, whoever Grandmother and Granddaddy went across and  then whoever was in the second car went across. They said,    See, it   s  okay.    Then, the women started to cross and they got swept down the  river. Because in all of this time, the river kept rising. So that   s not a  good story but Grandmother started Falls Creek Baptist camp.  He started it?  Grandmother did.  Oh, Grandmother, wow.  And they would swim in the river. And so the twins were swimming in  the river, they were all real good swimmers. They   d swim underwater  for a long time. My grandmother was a very strong believer in God and  God   s protection and divine order. Some people came in and said that  13  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  the twins, my Uncle Tommy and my Aunt Mary, had drowned  swimming. She was in a meeting, and she said,    Well, I   m in a meeting  right now. I   ll be out later.    Figuring, I guess, that there   s nothing I can  do. I mean, the reaction was not what one would expect. Well, and it  may have been that she realized that they swam underwater all the time  and that they really wouldn   t drown and they would be fine. And they  didn   t drown, they were fine. They   d just been swimming underwater. I  always remembered that, because I just thought,    What?     She always wanted to go to the Holy Land. They had been to the Holy  Land on this final trip before they went to Tehran and that was always  important to me. Grandmother would collect clothes. They would go to  the area of Arkansas where their relatives lived and they   d have to park  and then walk for however far up into the hills to see relatives. I just  remember all these stories of Grandmother and Granddaddy always  thinking about others, always wanting to help others and help people get  an education so they could have a better life rather than giving people  something for nothing.  Well, your grandparents, as you indicated, died in a plane crash in  Tehran, Iran on Christmas Eve or maybe a day before     It was   we heard on the 23rd of December. But the plane crashed on the  22nd.  Can you remember your feelings personally and the family at that time?  I vividly remember that. My mother was not demonstrative, my mother  did not cry very often. The phone rang and it was someone from either  the radio station or the newspaper, and asked what she thought about her  parents    plane crash. They called before the State Department called.  Oh, mercy. Were you in the home at that time? In the president   s home?  No, we were living out six miles north of town. My mother answered the  phone and I think she said,    Oh, no,    I don   t remember, but she started  crying so I knew this was really, really, really, really bad. And talked a  minute, not very long. I   m standing there wondering what has happened.  My mother told me and then I was crying, too. Or I don   t even know if I  was crying, I was stunned. I remember my father had been out feeding  the cattle. I remember he walked in and my mother said Grandmother  and Granddaddy had died in a plane crash in Iran. He turned around and  he walked out and didn   t come back for an hour or two while he dealt  with it. Later that day, someone came to the door, and this is December  23rd, and they were bringing a floral arrangement of some kind, I don   t  recall. When Mother looked at the card, it was from Grandmother and  14  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Granddaddy. My grandmother had arranged before they left to have  these flowers delivered. So that was not a good time. And the funeral     What do you remember about the funeral, Vera? I know a lot of people  were there, but can you share your feelings about that?  Yes. Well at first, when they talked to Mother, they said that everyone in  the plane had been burned up. That really upset Mother because her  mother was always afraid of a fire, of being in a fire. Later it turns out  that they were thrown clear. They were the only people thrown clear.  What we were told was that they were in their seats still, in the airplane  seats, with a Bible between them. It took me a long time to figure out  how that could happen, that somehow during the impact of going into  the mountain they were thrown. The impact, they were thrown clear and  still in their seats and with the Bible between them. Mother and Daddy  were very upset and they were trying to deal with this information.  I had been brought up that you go and live with Jesus when you die, and  I   m a little girl, so I know that they   re with God and they   re happy, but I  still miss them. My mother also would say that to me. They were so  upset and I was upset when Mother said that Grandmother was fearful of  being in a fire. And I never told my parents, but I called our minister at  the church   I mean I called him at home, and asked him   his name was  Sid Maddox, and I said,    Well, they say that Grandmother and  Granddaddy died and they burned up and is this okay cause  Grandmother was afraid of being in a fire?    I have no idea what he said  to me, but it was all the right things. That Grandmother and Granddaddy  were fine. But that   s who I called for me to get some support while my  parents were grieving.  And arbitrarily, they set the date for the funeral. My mother said my  grandmother was always saying,    You   re going to be late to your own  funeral. You are always late.    They almost were, because it seemed like  every country that they went through there would be a memorial service  for them. I think it was January 14th is what they had set, the date. The  plane got in with their bodies at like 2 o   clock in the morning before the  funeral. And Uncle Tommy had to identify them.  The service, was it in Gallagher Hall?  It was in Gallagher Hall and all of the family was in a room and being  together and all my cousins. Then we went out and Gallagher Hall was  packed. There were seats set up on the floor of the Hall. I   m sure it was,  they   d put something on top of the floor now that I think more about  basketball floors. But even with all of the seats, it was packed. And there  were people from   I don   t remember what black groups were called in  15  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  those days, but there were a lot of blacks attending the funeral, there  were Native Americans, there were lots and lots and lots and lots of  people. Senator Kerr was there. I   m sure there were a lot of others. I  don   t know if President Truman was there or not, but I think I would   ve  remembered that. I know Senator Kerr was. Mike Monroney. My mother  said it was an important time and a lot of people loved our grandparents.  Well, maybe a little bit more into the positive for you, I know it   s  emotionally tough to have this conversation, but kind of pick up on your  life. So when it came time for college, I guess there wasn   t any choice  was there other than Oklahoma State University for you?  I was the first grandchild to graduate from Oklahoma State University.  And that was in?  1962.  What was your major?  Junior high and high school mathematics teacher, education with a  minor in math. If I had one more three hour course I would   ve had a  major in math and also in Arts and Science.  Grandmother and Granddaddy went to Europe after World War II to  help people know what crops and to get back into growing crops. He  knew that the education was important and helping people renew their  lives. So after World War II he had gone and helped different countries.  And then he was also involved in sending people to China after World  War II to help the Chinese. Well, one of my best friends, almost like a  second set of parents, were Togo and Jane Sturdivant and Togo went to  China and was helping in agriculture. I would write him letters, which I  thought he could read. After I wrote him the letters, because I was four  and five years old, my mother would say,    Now, what did you tell  Togo?    (Laughs) And she   d write a letter. I thought he was reading what  I wrote.  Recently I came across one of the letters he would write me because he  would write,    Dear Vera Alma,    and    Tell your parents    hi.       He was  saying that Dr. Bennett had sent him over there to whatever organization  he was helping and that he had not planned to stay as long, but he  renewed whatever the time was because Dr. Bennett asked me too. He  said,    It looks like the Communists are going to take over the country.     And I know that Togo got captured by the Communist guerillas and  bribed his way out, was able to get out of the country. But I had not  realized that Granddaddy had been involved in that. So he was already  16  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  doing what Truman had him do for the country as the first Director of  the Point Four program. Granddaddy had been doing that all of his life.  After you graduated from Oklahoma State University then did you do  graduate work for a couple of years before you went into the Peace  Corps?  No, I graduated from Oklahoma State in May and on the Fourth of July I  landed in Washington, D.C. to go to College Park, Maryland to train for  the Peace Corps. A recruiter had come to Oklahoma State and shown a  video of Peace Corps training. We knew people that Granddaddy had  influenced that were working for USAID all over the world, and I  wanted to do that kind of thing because of my grandfather. So I went to  that and there were no females in it. I went up to the recruiter and I said,     Are women in the Peace Corps?    That was long before they realized  the message you get if there are only males in your movie, that   s saying  there aren   t any females. Anyway, he said,    Well, of course, females can  go.    He didn   t understand why I even asked the question. I said,    Do  they need math teachers?    And he said,    Yes.    So I applied to the Peace  Corps.  My father did not want me to go. In later years, I heard someone say that  she went in the Peace Corps and her father tried to bribe her by saying  he   d buy her a car and that triggered a memory that I got the telegram  from the Peace Corps saying I had been accepted into the Peace Corps to  go to Ecuador. That was on a Friday and on a Monday I was contacted  and offered a job in Sacramento, California. And I said,    Well, I   ve  already accepted this other one.    But my father did say,    If you stay in  the States, I   ll buy you a car.    (Laughter) My mother was understanding  of my wanting to go to the Peace Corps. She drove from Stillwater,  Oklahoma to San Salvador, El Salvador before the Pan-American  Highway in 1957 with Togo   s wife Jane and their daughter, Arora, and a  female dachshund and my mother and four girls and for awhile with  another car. So my mother was very adventurous.  I think the most difficult adjustment besides not being able to drive  anymore because I volunteered   I was involved in a lot of things and I  still am and I   m still tutoring people. But it was like, what if I can   t help  people?  When you   re talking about your interest in that, did that come do you  think from your background, from your grandparents and specifically  from Dr. Bennett?  Yes, from my     17  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  So your assignment then was in El Salvador, is that where?  No, no, that was where my mother drove. We stayed there a month and  then flew back. No, I was in the Peace Corps in Ecuador from 1962 to     64. My father had a heart attack on December 22nd of 1962    it was ten  years to the day that my grandparents died . I was running down the  stairs to get on a bus to go to Quito for Christmas holidays and a Peace  Corps jeep pulled up and said that they   d driven from Peace Corps  headquarters in Quito, Ecuador to get me and tell me my father had had  a heart attack and that I was going home. The planes didn   t leave Quito  to go to the U.S. every day of the week, so I think I had to wait a day or  two before I could get out. And I flew back. I got off the plane to change  planes in Houston and there were some relatives there, some of my  mother   s cousins, to see me there and get me to the next plane. I flew  into Dallas and it was icy and everything, they said they couldn   t fly on  into Oklahoma City. I spent the night in Dallas, flew out the next  morning and arrived in Oklahoma City on Christmas Day, not knowing  if my father was alive or dead. He was still alive, so you know, there  were people there to meet me, family to drive me to Stillwater. I went in  to see my father and he was still alive. He was in the hospital in  Stillwater. He died January 11th. As the oldest child, I couldn   t decide  quickly if I was going to go back to the Peace Corps or not. So I  recruited for the Peace Corps all over the state of Oklahoma for awhile  and then I went back to Ecuador in March and finished my term there  and then moved back to the States.  But from the things that my grandparents had shared with me or that I  knew from their travels in other countries, and then having gone to El  Salvador   well, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, when I was a junior  in high school and I remember seeing children with their stomachs so  bloated and asking why and being told,    Well, it   s because they don   t  get enough food and they have a lot of parasites and they   re sick,    when  I was in El Salvador. Then, I really wanted to go to Ecuador and help  people. I trained to teach math and Spanish. The girl with whom I  trained in the Peace Corps and went to the same town with was a science  teacher because this was a group of teachers, math and science teachers.  So we get there and I ended up   they said,    Well, we don   t need a math  teacher. We have a math teacher. We need an English teacher.    So I was  an English teacher. (Laughter) But you never look at things the same.  We have a lot to learn from other countries because they always have  time for family and friends. There   s a big emphasis in that. And you do  not find that that much in the United States. I was in the Peace Corps  early enough they had not determined that people need to be ready for  culture shock returning to the U.S. They train you for culture shock  leaving the U.S. and you never see things the same way again.  18  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  You come back a changed person from that experience.  So it was interesting. I wanted to, and I guess all of us want to, please  our parents. I particularly my whole life have wanted my grandparents to  be proud of me.  You have your PhD in mathematics. Can you share when you come back  and your degrees? A little bit about your life?  I came back to the states and ended up getting a teaching job in  Gaithersburg, Maryland, which is Montgomery County, Maryland.  When I had returned to the States after when my father died, I had gone  to Peace Corps Washington after he died and we   re trying to figure out  what I   m going to do and so that   s when I ended up recruiting for the  Peace Corps. I had talked to a friend in Oklahoma City. I had seen her  when I went to train for the Peace Corps because she was in D.C. for the  summer and she   d met me at the airport and got me to College Park,  Maryland. I stayed with her and took a bus the next day or something.  I   d met someone  who was  in the Army when I first flew in for Peace  Corps training, he would come see me and I thought,    Nah, I   m getting  ready to leave for two years.    But when I told the friend I was going  back to Washington, she said,    Well, why don   t you call him?    So I  ended up getting a job in Gaithersburg, Maryland, but I ended up  marrying the person that I had met before I left for the Peace Corps.  Then we went to the University of Maine to get our master   s degrees and  the person who wrote the book that was my favorite math book and math  class at Oklahoma State, the author of that book was at the University of  Maine and became my mentor.  Do you remember his name?  Howard Eves. He was just an awesome, awesome person. I taught  classes and took courses. His books and his focus was on the history of  mathematics. He is probably the only person in the United States, at any  university, that would   ve allowed me to write the thesis I did, which was  Mathematics in the Aztec, Mayan, and Incan Cultures. (Laughter) So  that was real interesting.  That was your master   s thesis?  Yes. Then, I had two children in Wilmington, Delaware where we  moved after we got our master   s degrees. Then, we moved to Lee,  Massachusetts in western Massachusetts. We got a divorce and then I  moved to North Carolina. Then, I finally moved back to Stillwater,  Oklahoma and I was teaching at a small school north of Stillwater. I was  the math teacher seventh grade up. Some of my seventh grade students  19  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  weren   t ready for seventh grade math. All I could tell them was,    If you  do this, you   ll get the right answer.    And that is not the way to teach. So  I started taking classes at Oklahoma State and became involved with  National Council of Teachers of Math. This person that I met was in  charge of a diversity group conference and I was invited to go to that  because of my Mayan mathematics and multi-cultural activities that I  was aware of. From there I got to know her better. She was teaching at  Oklahoma State and her name was Dr. Helen Cheek. And so because I  took the courses to learn how to teach elementary mathematics, then she  said,    Well, why don   t you just keep taking classes and get your  doctorate?    Which, I thought, well this is fun. I like to take classes while  I   m working full-time. (Laughter)  And this was in mathematics?  This is in Mathematics Education. She found out that she was dying and  told me four different places I might go to work toward a PhD in the  area in which I was interested. So I interviewed some people because by  then I was giving a lot of multicultural activities in the classroom,  speeches and workshops and everything at national conferences and  regional conferences. At one of the conferences I interviewed people  from two of the four universities she mentioned. One was too far north,  one was too far south, so I narrowed it down to two. One university, the  people there that were at the conference and that I was talking to said,     You   ll do what we tell you to.    Well, they were out. (Laughs) The  people from the University of Texas at Austin said,    You   re an  intelligent person, if you can justify and defend what you want to do for  your dissertation, it   ll be fine.    I thought,    Okay, I can deal with you  all.    So I ended up moving to Texas because I got a teaching job in the  public schools of Austin, Texas for one year and then I started teaching  at a community college.  Vera, move back a minute, where were you teaching when you were here  in Stillwater?  Red Rock.  Red Rock, okay. That explains the diversity issues a little bit there.  That   s 67  Native American there. I learned a lot. I thought I knew an  awful lot about Native Americans just from growing up the way I did.  But it was very interesting and insightful and then from there I moved to  Bartlesville and taught at a junior high there. That   s when my mentor  was dying. I had started applying to the one place that I was interested  in, which was in Austin. I got a call and went and interviewed and got  the job.  20  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Did you stay in teaching then? Did you finish your career in teaching  mathematics? Was it junior high, high school?  Actually, at a community college. I got a National Science Foundation  Award with a colleague of mine for developing a two semester course  for people who plan to teach in the middle school, a math course for  them to be prepared in a very innovative time-consuming math course  because everything was hands-on and projects and everything. It   s still  going on now.  And you still live in the Austin area then?  Yes, right outside of Austin and in my teaching at the community  college, I taught remedial courses like starting first grade, a course  where you start at the beginning. I also taught college credit courses. But  I taught a lot of different people with different learning styles, different  physical disabilities or learning disabilities so that I   ve learned about  teaching everything in three ways. And I taught a number of blind  students.  I forgot to ask you, if you don   t mind me backing up a little bit with the  chronological order. Is there anything that stood out in your mind of  when you were at Oklahoma State University as a student, some  highlights of your student experience at OSU?  I was very focused and I was very organized;  you have to be  when you  go through school in three years. (Laughs)  Well, as a math teacher, I can understand you being focused.  So I was very focused. I remember going to different events at the Field  House or Gallagher-Hall. Bob Hope came and I remember someone  gave him a headdress, I think. And I remember Hal Holbrook coming.  But I had gone to a lot of things when Grandmother would take me also.  I was very active in Religious Emphasis Week and Political Week,  Government Week. I can   t remember what it was called then. And I  remember once I was   who was one of the famous pilots in World War  II? Anyway, getting to meet all of these people and taking them around.  Although I was focused, I was doing things besides being in the library.  (Laughs) Those days, I was living in a sorority on-campus.  Do you mind saying which sorority you were in?  Kappa Kappa Gamma. And my mother was a Pi Phi and I   d been going  to Pi Phi. I mean my mother, my aunts, everybody was a Pi Phi.  21  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Was it an earth-shattering experience for your mom? (Laughs)  My mother was very accepting of it, she was pretty laid-back. She was  like,    Whatever you want to do.     Were you in some leadership organizations at OSU?  I mainly was committee planning, some of the things for Religious  Emphasis Week. Not in charge of it, but in charge of various  committees. One of the things I did, which is hard to believe now, I   m  definitely not a morning person, but during Religious Emphasis Week I  would lead the service at the Bennett Chapel at 7 o   clock in the morning  (laughs) during Religious Emphasis Week. I was active and I taught  Sunday School while I was going through college.  Was that special to you, Vera? Being a student at Oklahoma State  University, knowing that you had lived in the President   s home and that  your grandfather had been President? Did that make it special for you?  Yes, yes. It just never occurred to me to go anyplace else. It was very  special to be on campus as a student. I   d been on campus   I remember  seeing black students on campus before integration and there were all  kinds of international students here when I was growing up. I went to  first and second grade in the same year and I walked into this second-grade  class, new school, not knowing anyone. One of Togo   s Chinese  friends was there visiting the class. At that point I spoke some Chinese, I  don   t remember any of it now, but I was so excited to see her do that.  But Granddaddy always   there were just always lots of international  students that he started to get     You mentioned something that caused me to reflect that I want to ask  you about. When you were talking about being in Bennett Chapel, which  was built inside where the President   s home used to be, as they were  tearing down the home to build a chapel, you must   ve had some mixed  emotions.  I   m still angry about that. Well, I don   t know angry   unimpressed.  (Laughter) None of the family wanted them to tear down the house. Now  I understand it exists somewhere, that they moved it rather than tore it  down, but I don   t know where. Because I remember going as a little girl  to Lake Carl Blackwell when they opened that, I remember going I think  when he established the 25-year plan, if not it was some big thing I went  to. I think that   s what I went to, but maybe it was another celebration of  something. But it was so important to Granddaddy to have the buildings  look the same in this master plan. And for whoever made the decisions,  I   m sure it was none of my family, I mean none of the Bennetts, to build  22  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  something that did not fit in. It was like a slap in the face to Granddaddy  and the family. But mainly to Granddad because that was his    But it  was very, very disappointing. And then, to this moment, there   s no  money to take care of it. So it   s practically falling apart because it needs  so much done to it. Even when people have tried recently to raise  money, just to do maintenance that needs to be done, the money   s not  there. This is my personal suggestion, my personal thought is they  should tear it down and either not build anything or build something that  fits in. Whatever they build, have enough money to maintain it. Or just  tear it down and not build anything if you   re not going to maintain it.  But that   s probably not supposed to be.  You were talking about your grandfather   s activities preceding the time  he was doing Point Four. Can you share some of your thoughts on his  legacy and what you remember about his involvement and what   s  important to you about that?  I remember so many times either he said,    You don   t give a man a fish;  you teach the person how to fish. You don   t do things for people, you  teach them how to take care of themselves.    I grew up with that. When I  heard President Kennedy   s address,    Ask not what your country can do  for you, but what you can do for your country,    that was my  grandfather   s belief of what can you do to help others. That   s been  important to me all my life. And the sad part, because I just recently read  some of his speeches, he said,    The way to fight terrorism of any kind     (and this was in the worrying about the Communists time)    you make  sure they can support themselves so that they can have food and shelter  for their families. And that   s the way to combat terrorism of any kind.     Not by guns   he didn   t say that, but that   s the implication.  When he died, and President Truman was a lame duck president and the  Point Four program was a stand-alone program and he wanted to give  money back because they didn   t need it, the people in the State  Department were very unimpressed about ever giving money back. So  no one followed through, because Granddaddy had been so eloquent and  there was no one   President Truman was not liked well when he left  office. They later found that they liked him, but he wasn   t liked then. So  the next person was a military person  Dwight D. Eisenhower , the next  President was a military President and that changed the course of  history.  Part of Henry G. Bennett   s legacy in international education was  incomplete because he died in the plane crash. How do you think it  would   ve been different if he had finished out the next year or two in the  Truman administration?  23  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Well, the emphasis was on helping people help themselves. Now, Haile  Selassie had asked Granddaddy to start a university like this and the  pioneers from Oklahoma A M College who went to Ethiopia with  nothing there and built from scratch a university and it   s still going, I  really think that they were like, the people who agreed to go from  Oklahoma A M College to Ethiopia and start this school and stay there  and teach, were just like the Peace Corps, only they were ridiculed by  their contemporaries for getting tenure or not.    You   re going to ruin  your professional life if you go over to that country.    I   m so proud of all  of them for carrying on even to this day Granddaddy   s mission.  I think the world would be different today if we had continued realizing  that if you help, where there is no hope, those people are very, very  dangerous when they have no hope because  there is  nothing looking  ahead that   s going to make their lives any better. If we had spent our  time and our money helping people improve their lives I think the world  would be different. I heard a woman from Iran who was a Nobel Prize  winner in 2003,  Shirin Ebadi , and she said,    Don   t blame Islam for the  way it   s interpreted. Don   t blame the Christians for the way that some  people interpret it.    You know, don   t blame the religions, blame the  interpretations that people pull out. I don   t know, maybe you can never  have a peaceful world, but I think it   s a big start when you   re helping  people have not even meaningful lives but just lives where they can feed  their children and have a place to live.  Dr. Bennett   s program was the forerunner of USAID today. Would he  recognize USAID as the recipient of his initial program?  I think so.  Would it be the kind of program he would   ve believed in?  I kept in touch with the USAID people in Ecuador. You sure don   t go to  the Embassy to find out what   s really going on in a country. You go with  the people that are out there helping and working with the people. And  that   s still going on.  It   s changed, the philosophy, quite a bit as you indicated, USAID, what  he did. Would he be pleased with that change in emphasis do you think?  I was in the Peace Corps a long time ago. I know that they aren   t doing  as much in agriculture as they used to. I am not sure of all they do, but if  I just use my knowledge of what   s going on all over the world, where  the money goes, I think he would want to remind them of their original  mission. That is, you can   t keep throwing money at situations. Money   s  nice but teaching the people how to help themselves is much better. If  24  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  you   re familiar with Greg Mortenson, Three Cups of Tea, have you read  that book?  I have not.  Oh, you must read that book. Greg Mortenson is so much like  Granddaddy. It   s a long story, but he was mountain climbing and got  lost and was taken in by a village in Pakistan. The Taliban would be  coming around and they would protect him because the belief is that if  someone comes to your house then you protect them. He said,    What  can I do to repay you?    And they said,    Build us a school.    Well, he   s  still doing it, but he only goes places and helps the community to build a  school if he is asked. He does not go in and say,    This is what you  need.    And that   s what   s missing. It   s this,    We know that our way,     this is the United States,    We know that our way is the best and the only  way to live. So we   re going to come in and show you how to live like we  do.     There were values in his life that you   re sharing and I   d like to get back  to asking broader questions. We   ve touched on some of those and you   ve  mentioned some of them for example, what was his true north? What  values guided Henry G. Bennett in his life?  He was a very religious person. I don   t think he or my grandmother ever  made a decision without praying about it.  Did they pray publicly and in the home?  Yes, Granddaddy preached at a lot of the services when he was in town.  I mean he wasn   t the preacher, but I remember going to a lot of church  services where he was the preacher.  And, of course, his father was a Baptist minister, is that correct?  Yes.  Thomas, was that his name?  Yes, his name was Thomas and he was blind. I don   t know why, I   m  quite curious now. But he was an itinerant traveling preacher. My  mother says they never ate hot food. And that was close to being true  with Granddaddy   s prayers before we ate sometimes but not quite as  bad. (Laughter)  We   re talking long prayers.  25  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Yes, yes. The food was still hot, (laughs) or at least it was warm at  Granddaddy   s house. But there was always prayer and openly and we   d  pray with them at night when I was there. But prayer was a very  important part of their lives and reading the Bible. And, of course, my  great-grandfather, Granddaddy   s father, had memorized the Bible.  So even though he was blind, he memorized it? He could quote scripture  and verse from memory?  Yeah, so there was a lot of referring to the Bible. And with my mother, it  was if you   re following   I mean there are a lot of things in the Bible  that you   re supposed to be following.  Now about your grandfather again, what about education in his life?  One of his values was his Christian faith guiding him as you were  indicating. He felt strong about education?  His father felt very strong about education. His father donated the land  for the Arkadelphia School and then built a boarding house.  And this is Thomas?  This is Thomas, yes. So that people would have a place to stay to go to  the college. So they just knew that education was very, very important  and that gives your life options. But, you have your faith and you want  to have a meaningful life, but good intentions aren   t enough. Just having  good intentions is never enough. You must know what you   re doing.  And to do that, you have to have some skills. We fortunately do not all  have the same skills. We need to have plumbers and trash collectors and  carpenters and whatever. Nowadays, any high school graduate needs to  have further training or education. It was just incredibly important to be  able to have an education and open your opportunities in life. And  Granddaddy, you know all of those temporary buildings, the Quonset  huts during World War II lasted. (Laughter)  Yeah, temporary. Thirty year temporary.  Yes, very, very temporary. But that was part of the education, too. He  got the program for training here.  Vera, I   ve read that President Bennett believed in, in fact it was one of  his quotes I remember, that international education was first and  foremost, education is people helping people but it   s just an extension of  his land grant philosophy of teaching people, as you said earlier, to fish,  but teaching them. How do you feel about that, is that an accurate  statement? His approach to international education was really an  26  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  emphasis on education, teaching?  Yes. Teaching others so that they can teach others. You teach them the  skills that they need. One of the other things he said is,    You don   t give  a man a tractor if you put a steel point on their plow.    Or you give them  what would help them and be realistic and look to see what they need.   What are  your favorite Henry G. Bennett stories? You   ve got a couple  and you shared some earlier about Dr. Bennett that you remember from  your mother about the Bennett clan.  I just remember his vision and the stories so many times of how he  interacted with people and could see other people   s viewpoints and  would come away with some consensus. And that   s not one story, but  that   s something that there are so many different ways of that over and  over.  One, he wanted magnolia trees here in Stillwater and everyone said that  was impossible. He found someone who could make it possible and I  should have his name at the top of my   the person who   s in charge of  the beautiful     Thompson?  Yes. Theta Pond and everything. But I don   t know, there are just so  many stories and I can   t pull one out right this minute.  I appreciate you comment about expressing his traits, his ability to bring  consensus, his ability to communicate. And you used the word that you  hear frequently associated with Dr. Bennett, vision.  And he got up very, very early. People would say,    I want to meet.       I  need to talk to you.    Well, the way he   d figure out how serious they  were was he would say,    Okay, then come to my house for coffee at  5:30.    (Laughter) And the other thing was that he thought sleep was a  real waste of time.  What was the average amount of time he would sleep at night?  Four or five  hours  I think. I remember he was always up real early.  And I remember Granddaddy cooking biscuits. I remember Granddaddy  washing the dishes and he said he used that, kind of he could think and  wash the dishes. I remember Grandmother fixing toast. (Laughter) But  he liked to cook. He was the type of person that he wouldn   t ever ask  anyone to do something he wouldn   t do. He could get down and do the  nitty-gritty if that was necessary. And he could also do the intellectual  27  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  responsibilities. Very down to earth.  So he only averaged about four or five hours sleep a night? Was he a  very energetic kind of person?  Yes. He just never seemed to be tired. Surely he was. But he wasn   t real  demonstrative and he didn   t show his emotions very much. I remember  my mother saying that one of his really good friends died and someone  called or whatever, however he found out. But he went in his office at  home and didn   t come out for a really long time. Like either the next  morning or   I mean he just needed to be by himself. And I think that he  was able to do what he did because he had the focus, because he  listened. This sounds trite in this day and age, but he prayed a lot and I  believe that he was following his guidance and that that is where the  energy came from.  What summary statement would you say about Dr. Bennett the family  man? Not the public person, the family man?  Family was very, very important to him and having the family get  together. He always had time for the family even if it was an  interruption. And he was just very dedicated to   and extended family,  which was very, very large. It   s all of the children, you take care of all of  the children, that meant cousins or children of friends. He was just such  a wonderful, thoughtful, happy   not bouncy happy but just always  seemed to be happy. I mean as I said, just very positive.  And if you think of the times in which he lived, through the Depression,  through the constant fights with the different people in Oklahoma  politically, he was disliked by a lot of people. There was a case accusing  him of   the American Book Company I think, that he was, I don   t know  what that accusation was that went to trial and was in all the papers. And  I think it was an election year also that caused a lot of chaos. He was  exonerated, but it took a lot of time just to get it all settled and into court  and everything. That was very hard on my grandmother. Very, very,  very hard because they were so religious and lived their beliefs as  opposed to just talking about it, they lived their beliefs. That anyone  would think badly, that he would do anything that wasn   t right, just  devastated her.  How did your mother remember her father Henry G. Bennett as a  father?  I think some of the words were,    You just couldn   t ask for better  parents.    And very supportive. Expected you to do your best and to be  kind to others on top of all things. But just a happy family.  28  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  Let me close with this question. As I visit with other members of the  Bennett family, there   s a sense of specialness about being part of the  Bennett family and about the legacy of Dr. Henry G. Bennett. Do you  feel that? Is that so? Do you feel the specialness of being part of that  legacy?  Yes, yes it   s always there. That you know that Grandmother and  Granddaddy   as well as your parents, but Grandmother and  Granddaddy want you to always be doing things for other people and  help other people in whatever way you can. And my mother and my  father, I mean I would never want to disappoint them. That   s with me all  the time. The importance of the extended family but also always doing  something that helps others. But also you   re helping people help  themselves. You   re not always expecting that people can do their best at  their level. And you want to help them do that, you want to help them  have the most independent life and meaningful life that each individual  can have. My mother   s parents always had room for people who needed  a place to stay. My mother did the same thing. I do the same thing. I   ve  had people who   ve needed a place to stay. Actually, my birthday present  one year was my sister picked up a family whose car had broken down  on I-35 and brought them to my house. (Laughter) But it   s very  important to me to always have enough food that if someone comes in,  even though they weren   t invited for supper, that we always have  enough. It drives other people nuts.  It also makes me think of the stories I   ve heard of loans that Dr. Bennett  made to students. Do you remember these stories that he   d decided just  a handshake and pay me back when you can. Is that true? Do you  remember those stories?  Oh yes, that   s very true. Back in the olden days, you shook your hand  and that was your bond.  Christian word.  And you didn   t need all the pieces of paper. I   ve never been good with  pieces of paper. I mean I   ve thought they   re pieces of paper, it   s what  you say   I mean as I   ve gotten older and the world has changed I realize  you have to have pieces of paper.  Got to be able to bring, as you said, people need to show up for a meal,  if you come to his office and a is student in need of  10,  15,  20, he   d  give it to them right there on the spot and just say,    Pay me back when  you can.    I   m sure you   ve heard those stories.  Oh and he always would find jobs for people. So when you really think  29  Gill  Preston-Jaeger  about it, it was always,    This is the job so that you can get your  education now.    And loaning people the money, they followed through  and accomplished what they   ve gotten. Then you could say the debt is  erased because you   ve accomplished. I do that and people think I   m  nuts.  Great stuff. (Laughter) That is great. Well is there anything we   ve left  out that you   d like to mention that we haven   t talked about?  I can   t think of anything. I   ll think of something after you turn it off.  -------  -------
