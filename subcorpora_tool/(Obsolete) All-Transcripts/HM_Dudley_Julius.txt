Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.   Sir, could you please state your name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My name is Julius, J-U-L-I-U-S, Wayne, W-A-Y-N-E, Dudley, D-U-D-L-E-Y.
Speaker 1: And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born on October the 29th, 1944, born in the City of Atlanta; Atlanta, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay and what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I am Vice President of the Phelps Stokes Fund.  I've been affiliated with the fund for two years.  And prior to that position I taught at Salem State College in Massachusetts [now Salem State University]. I am now Emeritus Professor in History at Salem State and for more than thirty years I've been affiliated with educational institutions including Boston College [Massachusetts], Emerson College [Boston, Massachusetts], UMass Lowell [University of Massachusetts Lowell]; Morris Brown College, Atlanta, Georgia; the University of South Florida in Tampa, just a host of institutions and various foundations.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But, okay and what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is May 9th, I believe, 2003.
Speaker 1: Yes.  And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are located at my Atlanta home, 1330 New Hope Road, Atlanta, Georgia.  I had to hesitate about today's date.  Being a historian I can usually spit out dates very quickly if they're ancient.  But if they are contemporary like today, I might very well stutter through the process--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --as I did.
Speaker 1: --is your specialty ancient history?
Speaker 2: No, my specialization is recent American History but I have areas of specialization in Stuart England, African American, American West as well as European History.  Over the past four years I have acquired specializations in world civilizations.

Speaker 1: Okay.  All right now before we go into depth there are five lightweight "People Magazine"-ish type questions we're going to ask.  So you know, they just require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Kind of a warm up.
Speaker 2: All righty.
Speaker 1: So the first one is, sir what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food--tomato, spinach and broccoli.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's good.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Royal Blue.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Yes autumn, not too cold, not too hot.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Luxor, Egypt; Accra, Ghana; Johannesburg, South Africa; Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now--
Speaker 2: Listen I shouldn't smile so, I must be thinking about something pleasurable each time I say those names.  I apologize.
Speaker 1: That's okay.  Smiling is permitted (unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh okay.  Okay.
Speaker 1: So, now do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do, culture for service and service to humanity.
Story_ID: 94575
Speaker 1: Now let me ask you about what you know of your family history.  How far can you trace your family back?
Speaker 2: I can trace my family tree as late as 1786, Georgia, Wilkes Warrenton County, Taliaferro County.
Speaker 1: Hmm, okay.
Speaker 2: That's on the European side of the family, the Martins, M-A-R-T-I-N.  The Martin family. With the African component, the Robinsons, my great grandmother's relatives were from Clark County, Georgia, which is the county in which you would find the University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia], the Hanson family who lived in Washington, Wilkes County, Georgia and the Dudley family in Warrenton, Georgia.  Those are the family members I know something about.  Part of them I met.  My great grandmothers I met when I was a young child or a lad at age five, six and seven.  I have clear recollections about them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now are there--now are--do any of your--well, did any of your great grandparents report or your parents or anybody in your family remember stories from the time before or the end of slavery or Reconstruction or any stories from the nineteenth century?
Speaker 2: Yes, very much so.  In talking with my grandmothers and grandaunts and great-grandaunts, I have a clear recollection of what transpired during the nineteenth century, sayings and comments and stories and phrases and songs.  Some of the songs I dare not repeat.  They may prove to be a tad bit offensive but nevertheless I can sing some of the songs that my grandfather--
Speaker 1: Can you paraphrase some of them or tell us something, cause I think I know what you mean but a lot of people watching this are not going to know, have any idea what kind of songs (unclear).
Speaker 2: Okay, I can even imitate my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 94576
Speaker 1: He [Dudley's grandfather] was born during the 1880s.  He used to play the banjo, very intelligent man.  His father, well his grandfather was a white slave master and his mother was a slave and he would travel around extensively.  He never acquired a formal education but he could count and he could read the New York Times.  I can remember as a little boy sitting down, listening to my grandfather read to me.  He had the uncanny ability to look at a tree and then he could estimate the pieces of lumbar that one could extract from a tree.  He was paid to do this but as he grew older he thought about his salvation and the end of his life approaching and issues of that sort.  And sometimes he would sit and then sing spiritual songs and then other times he would sing songs of laughter and humor.  And I don't know if I should sing this one because this is going to really be offensive and I'm not doing my grandfather honor by singing some of his personal creations and I want to sing this song.  He would be sitting there out with his banjo, doom, doom, doom, bloom, bloom, and other times play the piano, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, ta, da.  And the song went something like this (starts singing), "Black gal you ain't got it all.  Oh black gal you ain't got it all.  Oh black gal you ain't got it all.  Oh black gal you ain't got it all.  If I had a knife I'd stab you to your heart.  If I had a knife I'll stab you to your heart.  If I had a knife I'll stab you to your heart.  Oh black gal you ain't got it all."  I said now what is grandpapa talking about?  I said how did he come up with those lyrics?  He was a very peaceful man.  He never, never harmed a fly.
Speaker 2: So did you ever find out what the, what all that was about?  What that was--?
Speaker 1: I believe he had dated a woman who was ebony black but he married my grandmother who was very, very fair skinned, granddaughter of a white slave master.  And maybe there was some friction just between the two women and that he would cling to my grandmother, his wife and maybe the other person had created much chaos within the family and so he may have come up with those lyrics for that reason.  This is a plausible explanation.  I will probably regret having shared that with you but that's one phrase or comment that I heard from my grandfather who lived during the 1880s and 90s [1890s] and died around the 60s, 1960s.
Story_ID: 94577
Speaker 1: His [Dudley's grandfather] aunt I heard so much about but never met, but recently I uncovered a picture of her.  Sister Ellen they called her.  She was a slave.  It's no question about it in terms of her time of birth, her own recollections.  My mother had a vivid recollection of her, especially when she told ghost stories, haint stories as they called them, haint stories.  I'm sure there are other experiences I had and I would sit around and listen to one about roasting potatoes old bay. The story went something like this.  There was an old man who was warned not to visit a certain house within Warren County.  The house was said to be a haunted house and the locals said if you'll stay in the house overnight we will give you a thousand dollars.  And, and he said oh I'll do it.  Said oh, take some nice sweet potatoes with you and if you stay there overnight then eat your potatoes, fine wonderful.  Well around midnight the man who was in the house all by himself heard some cracking noise coming from the forest, the local wooded area and so he would say I'm roasting potatoes old bay.  And then at some point he heard the noise coming closer and he said I'm roasting potatoes old bay.  And then at some point the noise of the crackling feet coming closer to the house walking on the steps, front door steps and the man said I'm roasting potatoes old bay.  And he heard someone open the doorway and about that time he said, I'm roasting potatoes old bay.  And when he heard someone walk in the room, he said the hell I'm getting out of here and he jumped out of the window.  He said you can keep the thousand dollars, you can keep the potatoes.  I'm out of here.  But the way the story was told when I was a little boy, my grandparents made it a bit more dramatic.
Speaker 2: And suspenseful?
Speaker 1: And (unclear)--yes, right.  And then I could just hear the crackling feet because they made the sounds, the creaking wood and you know okay.
Story_ID: 94578
Speaker 1: There were other stories, there were other songs.  My grandfather also created some spiritual songs too.  They were very touching spiritual types that dealt with warmth and love so it wasn't all violence.  I'm ashamed of myself for telling that story--singing his song.
Speaker 2: Well you--can you sing one of the other ones?
Speaker 1: Oh, no, no.  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I think it was a different song.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.  Well he would sing some of the standard ones like breaking bread together.  He would come through with his new arrangement.  He had a special arrangement and I cannot recall how he put the words and the music together but he was very creative and very bright man and I had the utmost respect for him.
Speaker 2: And did he play for--did he make money as an entertainer at all?
Speaker 1: No, not at all.
Speaker 2: Or did he do it on his own?
Speaker 1: This was a personal pleasure, self-enrichment, creative expressions that he would share with others and I was just a little boy six, seven maybe as much as--well I sat around his feet until I was about eight or nine.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I found him fascinating.  He loved my mother, his second oldest child, his oldest daughter, Ethel Hanson Dudley and I had very good impressions of him.  He cared about us--anyway, he loved us.
Story_ID: 94579
Speaker 1: Okay, well let's just segue into asking you about your mother.  Can you give us his--her full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Her name is Ethel Hanson Dudley, Ethel Hanson Dudley, E-T-H-E-L, Hanson, H-A-N-S-O-N, then she married my father [Julius] Dudley, D-U-D-L-E-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in 1920, and she was born in Washington, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: Wilkes County.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about her, you know what is she like and what did she do?
Speaker 2: My mother was the second oldest of nine children.  She looked more like her mother.  She was adored by her father, embraced by her mother for obvious reasons, mirror extension of the mother.  Actually born on her mother's birthday too, October the 8th, so my mother was my grandmother's birthday present. In some ways my mother was rather pampered being the, her oldest daughter and for more than fourteen years she was the only girl among seven brothers.  My mother was adored by both parents.  They wanted her to become a school teacher so at some point they made sacrifices to send her to one of the little schools in Washington, Georgia where she learned how to read and write and this was a profound intellectual development for the Dudley family because she could read, she could explain, she could read to us and that had a, a very important impact on all of us.  My father on the other hand never learned how to read or write through no fault of his own but we inherited his work ethic which was very important in a world that was evolving and changing around us and finding some sense of continuity that was critical with the intellectual piece.  But my mother had high ambitions of becoming a nurse or a teacher someday but after my mom and dad married and they agreed to have children and before they knew it they had nine children and I guess she put her life on hold for her children like so many other mothers do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 94580
Speaker 1: Now, now, did your parents have a story about how they met, or do you know the story?
Speaker 2: Yes, I know something about the story.  Just before my father [Julius Dudley] died, he died about four or five months ago, I put those questions to him.  During the final two years of his life he suffered with cancer so I had a lot of time to sit and talk with him.  I would travel from Boston [Massachusetts] to Atlanta [Georgia], from New York to Atlanta on a regular basis sometimes spending seven to ten days per month, seven to ten days out of a month with him.  And so I asked that question, how did you meet my mother [Ethel Hanson Dudley]?  He said well I met her at the C.C. Camp.  I met her through her father.  I was in the C.C. Camp that is the Conservation--
Speaker 1: [Civilian] Conservation Corps [CCC].
Speaker 2: Conservation Corps, a federal program during the Great Depression.  And my father would often talk to my grandfather, then his future father-in-law and that he would gather food and then give it to my grandfather to help feed the family.  When the Great Depression took a serious bite out of the family, those who had owned property lost their property.  At some point my mother and her family were in fact reduced to share croppers.  So in many ways I'm first generation, non-slave, non-share cropper from Georgia.  A man born in 1944 and probably perceived by the law as a equal citizen in '50 [1950], 1954 or 1964 so I lived during a period comparable to that of my mom and dad when racial segregation was the order of the day.  So that tells you something about my mother.  And I know that based on two or three stories from other members of--not saying, not only my father but my grandfather and uncles and aunts, they met through this C.C. Camp experience and my father was very generous and as he saw the Hanson family and he knew my grandfather and they were friends and at some point he introduced my father to my mother.  My father was a very handsome man.  You can see the photo, he's a--he was very, very handsome.  I have a photo of him when he was twenty-four years old.  My mother and her cousins called him the black Clark Gable.  And looking at his photo I could see very easily why they thought he was so handsome, because he was.  And so my mother fell in love with him.  He fell in love with her, he wanted a large family.   He was from a small family.  She was from a large one.  And when my grandparents left the rural areas of Warrenton and Washington, Georgia they moved to Atlanta.  My mother was a maid and my father was a chauffeur.  They worked in Buckhead [Atlanta, Georgia].  My father worked for a very powerful [Ku Klux] Klan family, the Venables and the Ropers who owned a quarter or a fourth or fifth of Stone Mountain where the Klan frequently met.  And the Venables had been very powerful in Klan affairs in Georgia for more than forty years but they adored my dad, they trusted him and they thought he was a very handsome fellow too.  My father recently told me that he had to watch his step for fear that he might have been lured into a compromising position but he was very, very careful because he knew that was not the best, best situation to find one's self.  It could been, easily meant his life or the ending of his life.  But my mom and dad married at the court house.  They just went downtown to Atlanta, the Fuller County Court--Fulton County Courthouse, got a marriage license and they did what was expected by the laws of the country and, or the county and they were declared husband and wife.  They were not--well they didn't have a formal wedding as such according to my dad.
Story_ID: 94581
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's full name is Julius, J-U-L-I-U-S, Dudley, D-U-D-L-E-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay, he's--all right now.  All right, are you a junior then or is it--or you just--is your name slightly different?  The Wayne is not in his name right?
Speaker 2: Correct.  There was always some minor controversy about whether to call me junior or not.  My father would often say this is Julius Dudley, Jr.  Well I have a middle name so technically I am not junior.  It was his sister, my Aunt Alberta who suggested to my mother [Ethel Hanson Dudley], "name him Wayne."  She was a big fan of John Wayne.  In a number of critical ways my aunt was rather superficial in her thinking but a very kind person and extremely beautiful human being, physically beautiful.  My mother respected her sister-in-law and her wishes and I was given the name Julius Wayne Dudley.  My father was born about 1917, December the 31st, one day before the New Year and he was one of three children.  He had two sisters, no brothers and he always wanted a large family.  And that's the reason why he married my mother because he knew that she came from a large family and the profitability of her being able to you know have many childrens, or I'm sorry to have many children appealed to him.  That was something that really appealed to him and he'd often say it many, many times, I always wanted a large family.  It was important to him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you said that he was a chauffeur for the Venables and the Ropers?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yes.
Speaker 1: The [Ku Klux] Klan, big Klan family.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Stone Mountain family--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in Atlanta [Georgia].  And he often you said he--well that seems like a tenuous position to be in--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to work for such a family?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: I know things are--it's a complicated--the southern life was more complicated than people think, you know.
Speaker 2: No question.  They adored my father because he was perceived as being "their nigger", end of quote.  He would take care of them and they would take care of him.   In talking to my dad he understood very clearly they exercised inordinate powers.  He could break the law but if the Venables or the Ropers called the county court or spoke to the sheriff, his offense was completely ignored.  He could break the law but if Mrs. Roper or Venable, I'm sorry Roper-Venable called, he was cleared.  They admired him.  They knew that at one point he was going to leave them.  He wanted to work in a job setting that would increase his salary or his income.  I forget how much he was earning as a chauffeur but he told them at one point he was going to get married to Ethel Hanson that he wanted to have a family and the money he earned as a chauffeur would not serve his purpose.  He needed more family time.  He needed more time with his family instead of living in the house with the Ropers on Peach Tree Street.  He said it's time that I move on and I can paint.  I can do house painting.  There's a job opening at the Atlanta Housing Authority.  Would you get me a job and talk to the right people at the housing authority.  And so the Venables and Ropers called the appropriate individual who ran the, who was in charge of the housing authority and my father was hired immediately when in fact--
Story_ID: 94582
Speaker 1: (unclear) there some kind of connection to this "Driving Miss Daisy" thing?  Somebody was telling me that--
Speaker 2: Driving Miss Daisy?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Somebody was telling me that your father [Julius Dudley] actually had--was a prototype for that or something or?  It was somebody.  I don't know if it was you was saying it to me.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: It was somebody that I was going to meet here in Atlanta [Georgia] was, their father was almost a prototype for the--
Speaker 2: Well, (laughter) yeah "Driving Miss Daisy."  Well, yeah 'cause my dad drove Mrs. Roper Venable [Mrs. Venable Roper].  And he said "Wayne, Mrs. Roper was a very nice lady and that she'd trust me with her personal belongings, her valuables, her privacy.  I could walk into her room and there she'd be in bed half-dressed."  And I said well daddy didn't you look sometime and did you notice what she was doing?  He said, "well if she was interested in having sex with me I pretended like I didn't see it.  But I could use her car.  I could go off and socialize in her big expensive automobiles.  I even wrecked the car at one point and she kept me on board.  She and her sons--and where her sons were like my brothers.  Sometimes when we would--when she would send me on errands they were calling me Roper and then he would care--tell them very plain, my name is not Roper.  My last name is Dudley."  But because he worked for them many whites would just assign him a new name or give him a name and I too experienced something like that in my life from age twelve to thirteen.
Story_ID: 94583
Speaker 1: I worked for a Jewish family in Morningside [Atlanta, Georgia], just outside of Buckhead.  A woman didn't want to call me Wayne and so she took it upon herself to call me Willie.  She felt like Wayne was, you know, was too much like British, American standard name.  You know if you're black, your name should be Willie.  If it starts with W it should be Willie.  But each time she would call me Willie I would ignore her.  I just, I--well I didn't hear you.  Then she would ask me to call an elderly lady, Hattie.  I was a house boy then.  Woman was old enough to be my grandmother and I asked Hattie, what's your last name?  She said Cox.  Cox, and so I said Mrs. Cox from that point on because I was taught you call your elders by their last name and you put a handle on that name.  And the same woman Mrs. Angel, the lady who was a mistress of the house had a son who was about four years older--well he was about three or four years older than I am and she wanted me to call him Mr. Bobby and I refused to do that, Mr. Bobby.  And he was a rather goofy character but a bookworm, a bookworm goofy character type.  And so he was fascinated to know how much history I knew and that he and I would talk history and that the mother would intervene and says, Wayne is to scrub the floors.  He is to do something else.  You can't talk with him and that kind of issue so I learned at a very early age that, that you had a dual system predicated on race.  If I didn't know, I learned very early.  Born in the city of Atlanta, I lived in a self-contained black community for the first ten years of my life and it was a good life.
Story_ID: 94584
Speaker 1: How did Atlanta [Georgia] look?  From my perspective it was a wonderful experience.  I lived on 862 Beckwith Street.  It was a working class neighborhood.  It was a neighborhood involving people from diverse backgrounds, but it was a working class neighborhood and there were teachers who lived across the street.  There were common day laborers, a seamstress.  There were mostly families, husband and wife families.  A few single family settings.  We had a self-contained neighborhood in the sense that we had a school, E.R. Carter Elementary School within walking distance.
Speaker 2: What was the name of the school?
Speaker 1: E.R. Carter--
Speaker 2: E.R. Carter.
Speaker 1: --Elementary School.  It was within walking distance of our home on 862 Beckwith Street.  There was a high school also within walking distance, Booker T. Washington High School.  There were colleges and universities nearby.  We lived within a shadow of these institutions, Morris Brown College, one of my alma maters, Atlanta University, now known as Clark Atlanta University, one of my alma maters, Morehouse [College] and Spelman [College] where I took classes as a member of the "Atlanta University Center", end of quote.  So this community had teachers, a seamstress, common day laborers, pastors, ministers.  There were churches within that community.  I can name at least three.
Speaker 2: Well what are they?  What are the others that you can name?
Speaker 1: I can recall the name of Shiloh Baptist Church.  That's one I can recall.  It was a self-contained community.  There was a grocery store called The Big Star.  There was a pharmacist, the Amos family.  I cannot recall his first name but his last name was Amos.  There was a black theatre, in fact two--one on Fair Street and Fair Street Bottom, the Fair Street Bottom area and the other one was on Hunter Street, now called Martin Luther King Drive.  There were funeral homes, restaurants, mostly owned by African Americans.   All of my teachers, principals were African American.  This was during the first ten years of my life.  They--the principal of the E.R. Carter Elementary School was a beautiful intelligent woman.  Her name was Mrs. [Florine Dyer] Furlow.  She was ebony black, she was well dressed and I thought she smelled so nice.
Speaker 2: How did she spell her last name?
Speaker 1: I'm not sure but it's--but everyone called her Furlow.  I'm not sure how she spelled her name.  But she was ebony black and very attractive.  There were others, Mrs. Ford who was very, very light-skinned but as mean as a wasp.  She had no--and then Mrs. Rivers.  Oh yes and Mrs. Rivers light brown, she was a real heavy hand.  She would whip the boys with a wooden paddle.  If you got out of line, she would say step outside and when you were asked to step outside, we knew.  Everyone who sat in that classroom knew what was going to happen outside because we would hear a lot of yelling and shouting and once she returned to the classroom, the student followed shortly there afterwards.  We saw red faces and tears of sadness.  I was very quiet.  Many times I would remain silent throughout the entire day unless I was at lunch or playing on the playground.
Story_ID: 94585
Speaker 1: My mother [Ethel Hanson Dudley] was terribly concerned about my "intellectual growth" as early as four.  I assumed that was the case in part because she wanted me to get a "early start" by sending me to the local kindergarten called Rush Memorial Kindergarten.  It was located on Brawley.  The street is now called Brawley.  I forget what it was called then but it's now called Brawley.
Speaker 2: Is it named after one of the educators [James P. Brawley] at Atlanta U [now Clark Atlanta University]?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yes, precisely.  This was a church too, Rush Memorial Baptist Church where they had a kindergarten.  I stuttered very badly as a child.  My father stuttered.  My grandfather stuttered.  Over two-thirds of my uncles stuttered, my mother's brothers.  And I guess my mother felt that it would serve as a serious impediment to my intellectual growth so she said I'm going to give him an early start and send him to school and hopefully he can gain the confidence that he would need to move forward.  That was a plus factor but I was very quiet in school.  I would hate, hate the prospects of coming or being asked to come to the front of the class and to read, Dick James and Puff, you know those, oh my God.  And there were times Mrs. Royal that was her name, would summon me to the front of the class.  And she said Wayne Dudley, read.  And I couldn't utter one word.  I couldn't even see the words and when she understood that I had reached the lowest point of "humiliation beyond humiliation", she would say well take a seat and I would go--well I, then I would return to the last row in the--the last seat in the last row thinking perhaps I could have avoided that humiliating experience not once but several times.  And I said my God there must be a better world.  What happened to me?  And then at some point I later found out the Moses stuttered, one of God's favorite according to the Old Testament and the Quran.  And I said maybe it isn't so bad after all and I said well my father seems to function well but my plight is a bit more difficult than his.  But I noticed even at that point my mother felt the need to give me a helping hand, a motherly attitude.  Since we're so close to Mother's Day I thought I would put that point in.  She's very proud of me today and I'm her doctor.  I'm a Ph.D.
Story_ID: 94586
Speaker 1: Now how did you--now, what did you do to eventually control your stuttering?
Speaker 2: Were you aware of the fact that I stuttered?
Speaker 1: No, I was not.
Speaker 2: I employed techniques of my own that would address the immediacy of the--and the need of the situation in which I found myself.  I learned very quickly how to substitute words, words that I anticipated being very difficult to pronounce.  I would find a synonym or a comparable word to substitute that word which would bring about or generate a prolonged speech or stuttering pattern which is a--well the actual holding on to the word, to the phrase is to a point that you would lose consciousness of what you were saying.  I had that--well the same question you asked me was put to me by conferees who attended the 7th International Stuttering Conference that was held in South Africa.  A speech therapist in that country knew about me through my book project.  I sent over three million books to South Africa.  (Unclear) South Africa's underserved schools and libraries then, this is back about the year 1999 when there was a meeting there and they asked me if I would make a presentation?  And I said well now how can I parley this piece of teaching at the University level and if I want to go to South Africa, perhaps I can get some research money or travel money and justify going to the country to make a presentation.  So I wrote a paper about prominent individuals in world civilization who stuttered.  And when the conferees heard me they said to me actually there afterwards following the meeting, you're not a stutterer.  But I said I am.  But I, but I'm a, but I am a "controlled stutterer".  Some of the speech therapists said to me from Germany, oh this is wrong.  You should just let it flow and you should just struggle until you get through the process.  And I says no, no, no, no, no, that's too much suffering and I refuse to suffer.  I will use synonyms.  Oh that's the wrong techniques.  I said well that's wrong according to the professionals but its right for me.  And I said I know how humiliating it is to pick up the telephone and say hello, my name is--I said I prefer not doing that.  I will say to you the name is Dr. Dudley.  Some people call me Julius Wayne Dudley, that's to avoid that initial prolonged stuttering pattern that can prove to be so humiliating and embarrassing not only to the person who's going through the process but the individual who must listen to you.  So it's an act of humanity for all parties concerned.  Now I can speak before large groups or television programs and they would ask the same question that you asked of me, how did you overcome it?  How did you overcome the practice?  You never overcome it.  You learn how to control it.  And that's what I'm doing even now as we speak.  I'm sure I've stuttered fifty times within the last twenty minutes.
Speaker 1: But we didn't know it.
Speaker 2: I know.  I'm controlled.  (Laughter).
Story_ID: 94587
Speaker 1: Tell me about--well you told us about grade school somewhat.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean what were your favorite subjects in grade school?
Speaker 2: I was perceived as a student with a torpid mind, slow learner because I had very little to say.  My grades were basically very poor ones, probably all Ds and one C, a C in writing.  My brothers made As and Bs, one even made all As, my brother Charles.  But I was sixteen months older than my brother Charles and that he would often study with me and I that I would teach him the subject matter, math and science and he learned from me which was very interesting.  He was a non-stutterer but I taught him how to learn and he made the As and I barely passed.
Speaker 1: Now what do you account, what accounts for that?  Now did you not test well or what was the--?
Speaker 2: We did not have MCAT exams when I grew up.  There were no such intelligence exams that I'm aware of.  I was just generally con--well it was generally perceived or yet it was perceived that I was not a very good student until I started reading articles of interest and usually they were historical articles.  I can recall one that I read in the Look magazine.  And it was a fascinating article and it dealt primarily with English royalty, Henry VIII and his six wives.  When I read portions of it, I said my God I want to know more about this man who married six times and beheaded two out of his six wives.  I said this is incredulous, you know how could this happen?  You know why would this happen?  And I literally begged my mother [Ethel Hanson Dudley] to read certain portions of the article that I could not read on my own and I literally begged her to take me to the library then the West--I'm sorry the Hunter Hill Library.  The--well the library that was designated for black children.  We were not allowed to go to the main library in downtown Atlanta [Georgia] then.  And in fact there were a lot of things we were not allowed to do when I grew up in the city.  There were signs, black and white signs, water fountains.  We were told that we couldn't eat with white customers or even go into the cafeteria of the Riches (unclear)--well a major store called Riches, Jewish-owned but they had to adhere to the rules of the dominant white society.  So once I could get past the social-economic racial point of life, I concentrated on reading about British royalty.  And my mother got me a library card and I started reading and those sections I could not read on my own, she would read to me.  I read articles about the slave trade, the African slave trade or the "Atlantic slave trade" I should have called it, the Atlantic slave trade and I was fascinated by that piece.  It appeared in the Ebony magazine and I was very young.  And those were the first two articles that caught my attention and it created this interest to know more.  I could transcend geographic--I'm sorry, I could transcend geographical boundaries, historical timeline boundaries.  You know I could allow my mind to explore new and interesting possibilities and this is part of my message when I usually travel to South Africa or talk to students from the inner cities or students in my University classroom settings, saying the power to read and the power to transcend boundaries that are seemingly so difficult to transcend.  You can do it through the power of the mind and a mind that's cultivated and a mind that's educated.
Story_ID: 94588
Speaker 1: My teachers thought I was fascinating.  For the first time they would say you know this Dudley fellow knows a great deal, my God.  My brothers and I could sit around and then quote historical dates, two or three hundred dates because we had time.  We enjoyed learning and I became a resource not only for the family but for the school you know.  People would talk about it.  You want to talk to Dudley.  He knows a lot about X-Y-Z and say, the process of this new status.  I cultivated a sense of self-worth being able to stand tall on knowledge that I had acquired.  And many of my friends as well as many of my university college professors would call me the walking history text book and I found that very nice and so and wonderful and so I said I think I want to major in history.  So history is where I belong.  I had wanted to become a lawyer at one point.  I said oh, well you're a black man, a black student.  You know, lawyers yeah there some black lawyers but most lawyers grow--have difficulties finding work and if you teach or preach then you can find a job.  Engineering, well I don't know whether there are any job opportunities there so well I'll teach.  Well teaching was not a bad profession and so most of our leaders were reasonably well-educated, college graduates some of whom taught and others who were ministers.  That was a part of my world.
Story_ID: 94589
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well tell us about high school.  Now where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: I graduated, well I attended--well I should back up a little bit.  From age ten to thirteen we lived in a rural part of Georgia.  We left Atlanta [Georgia] because the family had grown much too large and my mom and dad wanted to save money so at some point we did in fact move to the redneck part of Georgia called Smyrna--Smyrna, Georgia, Cobb County.  There we lived on ninety-three acres of land owned by this member of the [Ku Klux] Klan organization.  We agreed to work the roads.  We would enjoy free rent. If you needed human resources to--my father or my brothers and sisters to work in the fashionable homes of Buckhead [Atlanta, Georgia], we did so.  Of course we were paid for our services but you know we were available.  And I think that the Ropers and Venables really adored my daddy in many ways.  I'll be honest with you.  I didn't know that my father was a chauffeur at the time of my birth until I was a graduate student at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and I looked at my birth certificate and there it was.  But the fact of the matter is that we lived in Smyrna for about three years, the worst three years of my life and I attended a school called Rose Garden Hills Elementary School for about two or three years.  We had to walk a long distance about four miles to the closest school designated for black children, Rose Garden Hills.  There were closer schools that were populated by white students and we had to walk.  We saw white children on buses and sometimes they would throw stones at us when they drove past us.  We had to walk a long distance.  There were some bitter experiences involving Klan-type individuals who would follow us.  We had to walk down long dirt roads, trees for miles, you know.  No families nearby just mostly wooded areas and wild animals, treacherous in many ways.  And there were a couple of men who had trailed me and my brother and my sister along the way and they wanted to have sex with my younger brothers.  And I was then about eleven years old, very small, thin and I had to take the leadership role and I asked my brothers and sisters to walk close to me.  Do not look at those nasty men.  That was my response because I took note of the fact that one had actually unzipped his trousers and I saw his body part and he was encouraging one of my brothers and my sister to get in the car with them.  So this was a time when there was a great deal of racial tension in the air, was--the Emmett Till case was well known and we had something in our psyche of psyches to think about once we encountered that bitter experience in Smyrna, Georgia.
Speaker 1: You were about ten years old when that happened?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes about ten.  That was our first year in Smyrna.  My mother had a way of encouraging us to see the best of all possible worlds.  And you know we really believed it.  We said oh we're going to go into the country.  We're going to really have a wonderful time.  But once we got there, we said oh well now this is not so nice after all.
Story_ID: 94590
Speaker 1: Okay, we were talking about Smyrna [Georgia] and the--of course the Emmett Till case.
Speaker 2: Right, and were you as a youth, were you and your brother and sisters keenly aware of lynchings that had occurred in the South during the previous I guess 200 years?  I mean at one time the [Chicago] Defender in Chicago [Illinois] had pictures of lynchings on the cover and people all over the country would see these, Pittsburgh Courier, other papers would carry these photographs.  And then the descriptions, black community, it--were you all aware of the danger?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Growing up as a child in this country, especially in the American South, I was made aware of it and I can recall very clearly comments made to me by my dad and mother, one of which dealt with a riot from--while my father and I took a trip to Warrenton, Georgia.  My father is from Warrenton and he was going to visit his grandmother and we took off that morning from Atlanta [Georgia].  And as we approached Warrenton, this state trooper pulled us over to the side and said pull the car over to the side and said to my dad, Boy, don't you realize that you're going too fast?  I looked around, you know how little children, especially sons watch their dad driving the car, they, admire their dad driving an automobile.  And I was just looking at the--I said but you were driving thirty-five miles an hour and the sign says thirty-five.  I was saying that to myself.  My father--"oh, captain, I'm so sorry.  I didn't know I was driving so fast."  I looked around at my dad and said, who is this man?  What happened to him?  He has become transformed and just to a person I've never seen before.  And he said, "well cap, I'm just so sorry.  I just, just didn't see it.  You're absolutely right, you know I'm just--you know some of my folks work at the courthouse in Warrenton, Georgia.  My grandmother is Lizzie Dudley and my uncles, Tony Scott and you know they have done very well in life.  They have a little funeral home and they have businesses.  You know I really come from a good family."  In so many words he was telling them you know now I have some connections but really I'm sorry.  If you say I'm wrong, I'm wrong.  And then when the police drove away or the state trooper drove away from the car, drove away from my father's automobile, I--my head was down to the ground and I couldn't look my father in the face and he knew instinctively that I was hurt and that I needed a "explanation."  He said, "oh Wayne, sometimes you have to do that to get along with these people because, you know, they can hurt you."  I said to myself, you, the strongest man in the world, the one (unclear) protector of the family?  Why would you transform yourself into this kind of person?  Of course I didn't express that to my dad but these were my inner feelings.  Yes, in growing up in the South I heard about lynchings.  My mom and dad talked about lynchings during their earlier life experiences.  I even heard about a black man who was--who was say, executed by the state because they said that he had had sex with a white woman. And I heard about the Emmett Till case and we saw the photos in a Jet Magazine.  I can see this clearly as I'm sitting here talking with you, the face before and the face afterwards where they had literally beaten the hair off from his head.  And we were frequently told that if you cross the color line you can expect retribution of some sort.  And there were certain classmates who lost their lives due to the fact that they were in conflict with the Atlanta Police Department as well as other departments.
Story_ID: 94591
Speaker 1: I can recall instances where children, white children would throw rocks at us.  The mother of the children would be driving her automobile and at some point when the children screamed out the car and called us motherfuckers and black bastards, we were literally stunned for a parent to sit there and to watch his or her children curse another human being out.  This was very new to me.  So racial comments of that sort were made, fears and apprehensions were expressed about those persons who knew of family members who had been lynched or persons who were threatened with lynchings, including my grandmother and a few others.  So I knew about this and I also knew that in Smyrna [Georgia], Leo Frank, a prominent Jewish businessman--well he wasn't prominent but yet he was a Jewish businessman who was literally taken out of the prison walls and killed in Smyrna [sic, Marietta, Georgia].  He was lynched in Smyrna.  So we read about lynchings--
Speaker 2: That's right.  That was a famous case--
Speaker 1: Yes, right.  Leo Frank had--
Speaker 2: --and then a movie of that case and--
Speaker 1: Right.  That took place in Smyrna, Cobb County.  I--
Speaker 2: (Unclear) post-card and a post-card of his lynching were the most widely distributed of all--
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 2: --those lynching post cards.
Speaker 1: Um-hmm, yes.  So I actually lived in the county.  I even know some of the children of the man who probably killed Mary Phagan.  My grandfather used to sing a little song about Mary Phagan.  There were a lot of little songs saying--oh (unclear) not the song just come to mind but I'm sure my mother could probably tell you that one and it just dawned on me.  But I'll be able to (unclear) later.
Speaker 2: Mary Phagan was the--
Speaker 1: Was the little white girl.
Speaker 2: --little girl that was supposedly killed by Leo Frank.
Speaker 1: Yes, and some said it was the janitor, Jim Conley.  I knew the Conley children.  They were in my classes at the Rose Garden Hill Elementary Schools.  They lived in Vinings [Georgia].  I knew them and I knew them well.  But Smyrna had a reputation of lynching, lynchings, not only blacks but whites and for those young white men probably in their twenties who wanted to engage in sexual activity with my brother and sister, you know this was a very hateful time and it frightened my mother and she said, Julius--she spoke to my dad and said, we got to get the children out of here because these young white men in their twenties trailed us for almost one mile and I had to keep my younger sisters and brothers in place.  And then at some point when in fact we were close enough to the house, we took off running to the wooded area and ran up a hill for--a hill about a half mile in order to get to the house.  We lived on a mountain from the main roads about a half a mile.  But I said we didn't wait to get to the entrance, we just took off and ran up the hill because we were so afraid.  So yes, we knew about lynchings.
Story_ID: 94592
Speaker 1: Part of my dissertation dealt with mob violence and lynchings.  I graduated from the University of Cincinnati [Ohio] with a Ph.D.  And I was interested in doing work on Marcus Garvey but my advisor suggested that I explore other possibilities, places where I could find resources and so I settled on mob violence, women's rights, civil rights organizations, how southern white women responded to the issue of lynchings.  There were a fair number of church women who were in opposition to lynchings and they organized themselves to put the world on notice that we do not want mobsters to lynch in our name.  Do not use white women as an alibi to engage in murder.  It is unchristian.  It's wrong-headed.  It's illegal.  And at the same time this group of white women led by Jessie Daniel Ames did in fact oppose the Federal Anti-Lynch Bill.  She undermined the credibility of other courageous southern whites who were in opposition to lynching.  She worked behind the scenes with those politicians, say politicians who were in opposition to the Federal Anti-Lynch bill, some of the most ardent foes of the Federal Anti-Lynch Bill, Jessie Daniel Ames was there.  My dissertation should have been treated more seriously but there was another white woman who wrote her dissertation on the same topic. She had better connections, funding and she got her dissertation published.  Mine was never published.  But we wrote from a different perspective. I stressed the theme of the black community's response to this group of southern white women, how did the black press respond to these noble church women, those areas where they agreed with them and those areas where they disagreed with them.  I found out very quickly that Jessie Daniel Ames did her very best to undermine black civil rights leaders. She would talk with them, she was friendly with them but at the same time she was undermining their "legalistic efforts."  It's very interesting to note that Dr. [Jacquelyn Dowd] Hall who wrote her book on southern white women went to some of the same sources and documents, yet some of the documents that were very critical proving that Jessie Daniel Ames was not what she said she was, never surfaced or seldom surfaced.  So that's a sad component of American scholarship and perhaps scholarship in general.  Several individuals have read my dissertation and have cited my work in textbooks and others have used my work without giving me recognition and that's a part of the academic life.  It shouldn't be that way but that's the way it is.  My dissertation has been used many times and I know this, but I have no control over who uses it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now and that's--yeah, that's (unclear).
Speaker 1: So yes, lynchings had a profound impact on me and later I found myself writing about it in my twenties, in my late twenties, thirties.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I graduated from University of Cincinnati at age thirty-five with a Ph.D. in history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 94593
Speaker 1: Now I want to go back to--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --Smyrna [Georgia].  Now how did you all get out of Smyrna 'cause your mother had said let's get out of Smyrna and that seemed like a good idea.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  In fact it would have been the very best possible idea.  Being the oldest child I had to shepherd my brothers and sisters through the difficult days but at some point I had to attend--well after graduating from Rose Garden Hills [Elementary School], the closest black high school was in Marietta [Georgia], Lemon Street High [School] which was another two or three miles from Smyrna and also another two or three miles from the home site, about six miles.  And that would have meant that I would have had to leave much later in the evening--much later in the afternoons and probably get home by myself early in the evenings at, during the daylight or darkness.  And so my parents agreed that I should travel to Atlanta [Georgia] with my dad since he worked at the Atlanta Housing Authority and the housing authority was so close to Booker T. Washington [High School] that I should enroll at Booker T. Washington.  And so at that point my mother said, well perhaps Charles can you know continue to walk another year but--so we must leave.  We have no electricity, we had never had electricity in Smyrna, we had outside toilets, it was just not a good place.  And so at some point my parents decided that this was not the best place for the children and we moved to Ashby Street and from that point my younger brothers and sisters enrolled at the local grammar schools and that I continued to--well I continued to study at Booker T. Washington High School and the other brothers and sisters enrolled shortly there afterwards.  So yes, my life was a tad bit different.  When my students look at me today and say, oh Dr. Dudley you have this and you have that amount of property.  You seem to be doing very well financially.  Yes, well there were times when life was not so pleasurable and you must learn from that experience that life is not a bowl of cherries. You know life is worth living.  It's a challenge and you must look forward to the challenge and find the beauty in the struggle in that challenge.  And so they realized the seriousness of the Smyrna experience, the consequences and because of the proximity factor, job opportunities for my dad, we had to move.  It was too dangerous.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 94594
Speaker 1: Tell me about Booker T. Washington [High School, Atlanta, Georgia], you know how did you do at Booker T. Washington?
Speaker 2: Booker T. Washington was a good experience for me. There were certain teachers who took a special "shine" to me, who liked me, who thought that I was a capable student.  There were a few who looked down upon children who were from poor neighborhoods, those who were not as light-skinned or those who were not as affluent or parents who were not teachers and preachers.
Speaker 1: So there was a class--?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yes, putting it bluntly there was a--
Speaker 1: Caste system.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a color caste system.  But one could break to this in part if you were college-trained even though you were ebony black.  I guess education was highly respected in my community.  Those persons who were ebony black like Benjamin Mays, he was very, very African looking.  Yet, he was educated and you know he could marry a light-skinned woman, a white-looking black-skinned woman and that you know that would be fine.  But class and caste was a part of the experience.  But at Booker T. Washington, it was diverse.  It was the first black high school in the State of Georgia with many prominent graduates, persons who came from the poor side of town, those persons who were from the wealthier side of town.  For example, [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King, Jr. graduated from David T. Howard [Elementary School] but he attended Booker T. Washington and probably would have graduated if he had not received the early admission scholarship.  His mother [Alberta Williams King] graduated from Booker T. Washington and also graduated from Morris Brown [College, Atlanta, Georgia], my alma mater. She was probably the first of her family to graduate with a college degree and no doubt she taught Martin Luther King how to read and write.  She was a schoolteacher and a pianist and she was also assassinated like her son.  With a Morris Brown educator--with a Morris Brown education she taught her children who later went to Morris and Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  She probably assisted Martin Luther King, Sr. how to write his papers and to read because he--
Speaker 1: That's what they write now that she--
Speaker 2: Yes, because he was not the most intellectual person I met.  He was not the most intellectual person I met during my graduate career.  I did in fact interview him.  I wanted to have some stars who were interviewed and so he was one of them and he had lived in the South and he had some opinions about lynchings and I had about a thirty minute interview with him and I found out very quickly that he was not particularly intellectual.  And I look at his wife, Alberta Williams King, a graduate of Morris Brown, cultured, who was made to take the back seat to a man who was not--who was a bit rustic in his mannerisms, in his wording.  And I said this is not the Martin Luther King, Jr., it's the mother, with the Morris Brown education.  So he graduated from Booker T. Washington, the first African American since reconstruction to hold a seat in the Georgia House, graduate of Booker T. Washington.  [HM] Julian Bonds' brother, James Bond, was in class with me.  You know Booker T. Washington.  It was the high school for most blacks in the City of [Atlanta] Georgia for a long period of time until Turner and other schools and David Howard and others appeared on the scene.  But it was very diverse and so you had the children of thugs and the children of doctors and lawyers sitting in the same classroom.  We learned from each other.  I had a strong B average, B, B+ average and so I was put on the fast track, those students who were destined to go to college.  I found that interesting cause I was so quiet but I had very good grades.  I managed to pass my exams.  My brother Charles had a straight A average and later became valedictorian of his class and also the first African American student to attend Emory College [now Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia], and he graduated from Emory as the first one.
Story_ID: 94595
Speaker 1: But there were teachers who made differences among the, say among the students based on race and color and say, of course economic circumstances.  Mrs. Richardson for example was notorious for doing her evil deeds, walking about--by point--walking up and down the aisles and said this is Mr. Mann.  Oh, he's slow in geometry.  He'll probably get a C or a B out of my class but he's going to do well.  His father teaches music at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and so Mr. Mann is going to do well.  He's going to graduate Emory [University, Atlanta, Georgia].  He's going to Morehouse too.  Now you see that student over there, Dixon, his father is a common laborer.  He's always playing a--playing the tuba in the band.  He's not going to do anything in life.  Oh, he has a B average but he's going to fail in life.  He's going to end up pushing garbage.  And she had a anger about her, she, you know she was just very mean-spirited.  And I can recall her looking at me and said, oh well those Dudleys, they're bright children but they're poor.  There are too many of them and they're not going to amount to anything.  At some point I graduated from Morris Brown [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and subsequently at Atlanta University [Georgia] and earned a master's degree and I went to University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia] and earned a certification in early childhood education and I saw her and I made it my business to go over to her and say, Hi Mrs. Richardson.  My name is Wayne Dudley.  I was one of those students you predicted would not do well but I'm here with you, I'm one of the faculty.  I am now a member of the Atlantic Public School System.  I understand there were many others who approached her the same way.  She was a very strange person who should not have been in the classroom.  But she was an exception.  The vast majority of the teachers saw in us an extension of themselves and then we in turn could see our future through their accomplishments.  And that was critical for us who lived in a southern society and a national society that was not particularly friendly to African Americans.
Story_ID: 94596
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now in high school, you engage in activities around--did you play sports or anything or did you do anything like that or clubs or social life or--?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have pictures of myself a member of the chess club, the boys' chorus.  I had always wanted to play the--I had always wanted to learn how to play the piano.  My grandfather played the piano.  My mother's brother and my uncle played the piano and it's something I wanted to do.  But because we lived in Smyrna [Georgia], Atlanta [Georgia] and we were constantly on the road going back and forth, and that we had so few dollars, we were marginally poor, I settled for the boys' chorus and so did my brothers and we had a fairly good time.  We learned a lot of classical music.  I learned to appreciate symphonic music, [Jean] Sibelius' Finlandia.  We had a--they let us, at Booker T. Washington [High School, Atlanta, Georgia] there was a orchestra led by Ms. Green.  Some of my classmates played the violin and the other instruments that make up orchestras and I was fascinated.  The band was superb.  You know everybody rocked with the band [snapping fingers].  But then when the orchestra was asked to make a selection some of the students, oh my god, the long haired music.  And I no doubt went along with that for a while but at some point I began to listen and I heard Sibelius' Finlandia.  I said this is really nice.  And then at some point when I bought one of the albums, I said those young people, my classmates were highly advanced.  I recognized their music even among the great ones who were accomplished symphonic people.  And we learned songs in Latin, [singing in Latin], that was one of the songs written by [Johann Sebastian] Bach, I believe.  And it opened up worlds of possibility as to the complexities of life and western culture as well as world culture.  And I found that in my experience, I found that as a part of my experience at Booker T. Washington.  I know that Booker T. Washington was perhaps the first and the only high school in the State of Georgia during the 1950s and 60s [1960s] that had a teacher, a black woman who taught Russian.  She was a Russian teacher.  I took French and Latin, wish I'd taken Spanish.  But there was a Russian teacher.  I don't know how many students enrolled in her class--
Speaker 1: I know we talked to Jean Carne [HM] earlier this week and she--
Speaker 2: Jean Carne, I know.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) student in Russian, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes.  She was a student at Morris Brown [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  I know her.  We were also members of the Morris Brown College Choir.  Jean Carne, yes I know her.  She knows me too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, she was one of those students who took Russian.
Speaker 1: Yeah, she--
Speaker 2: Yes, it's amazing.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) to go to Russia.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Didn't go because of some other extenuating reasons.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  She was at Booker T. Washington.  She's about a year or two younger than I am.
Story_ID: 94597
Speaker 1: All right.  Now when you were a senior in high school, you knew you were going to college, right?  You knew you were going?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You didn't?
Speaker 2: No.  It was assumed that I would go to college because I was a Dudley, one of the brighter students in the senior class.  But unfortunately there were practices of longstanding at Booker T. Washington [High School, Atlanta, Georgia] that proved to be counter-productive to most students, one of which dealt with the children of prominent people like the Watleys (ph.) and the Powells (ph.) and the Dowdys (ph.) and the Williams (ph.) and the Matthew (ph.)--wait, excuse me, anyway, there were others, a host of them.  And these children were generally perceived as being the most promising ones and that they had parents who were affiliated with Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] or some of the other colleges, and therefore they were destined to go to universities and colleges.  Therefore, the counselors would then concentrate on these people and made sure that they not only got one scholarship but ten and twelve scholarships.
Story_ID: 94598
Speaker 1: We're ready. We were talking about the admission again.
Speaker 2: Yes.  When I was a senior at Booker T. Washington High School [Atlanta, Georgia], I was placed in the classrooms where students would most likely enroll at a university or college, the so-called accelerated learning programs.  I don't know how I got into those classrooms other than I had a B+ average.  And it was generally felt that most bright students would go to college and I felt that way.  How to do it I didn't know.  I just didn't know.  My parents were not college graduates.  My parents were not high school graduates and so they invariably relied on the experts and black professionals to just, the counselors to assist us, the Dudleys.  This was not true in my case.  There was a standard practice that the children of prominent families, well-connected, pretty ones, that meant light-skinned with soft hair or the ones usually singled out for the college tracks, therefore some of them--therefore some of my classmates secured ten, fifteen scholarships, some astro-you know some huge number when in fact they can only take one.  And everyone knew that the person was going to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] or Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia]. Oh, she got a scholarship from Vassar [College, Poughkeepsie, New York].  She got a scholarship from Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut].  Everybody, oooh yeah, well Joann got this.  Oh wonderful."  And then you know--and I said, wow, what is this?  Ten or twelve folk getting all the scholarships.  Then there was a young man who sat next to me, his name was Alfonso Dawson (ph.), his father was a graduate of Morris Brown [College, Atlanta, Georgia], very well connected person in the teaching profession, you know top flight person.  Alfonso had a C or C+ average and he stood next--sat next to me and then I found out that he got a scholarship too, not only to Morris Brown, to Fort Valley State [University, Fort Valley, Georgia].  And I'm simply saying you know my grades are better than yours, I'm a smarter student than you are, but you're better connected.  And you get the opportunity to stand up for people to applaud you for your two scholarships.  I said something isn't quite right about this picture but it was too late after graduation. One day Buddy Coleman (ph.) who visited his uncle, one of our next door neighbors, one of our next door neighbors and he said--he had spoken with his relatives there and he must have asked, no doubt he asked the question, which one of the Dudleys going to college?  Which one graduated?  Which one is going?  No, where are they going to school?  And so he inquired and he spoke to my mother [Ethel Hanson Dudley] and subsequently spoke to me and I said, I don't know.  I--well I got some post cards in the mail from the local colleges and they asked me to check off something and I said yes and yes and you know that's all I've heard from them.  He said "you have not, you--have you completed the form?"  I said no.  He said, "have you--well therefore you didn't get a letter of acceptance did you?"  I said no.  He said "well that stands to reason you didn't make application."  He said "oh, don't worry.  I'm going to take care of this."  He went to the campus, spoke to Carrie Clemons (ph.) and then other staff persons of Morris Brown and he brought me an application form in May I believe it was after graduation, after graduating from high school and he processed the application, get me, got me the National Defense Loan Application.  I completed it.  I was awarded $250.00 and I said, well I'm going to need another $250.00 and I worked, waiting on cars at Jan's Burger Shop and The Varsity in downtown Atlanta and I earned at least three or four hundred dollars and so I had at least $500.00 for my tuition.  I had no idea whether I would have sufficient funds to enroll the second semester.  I didn't worry about it.  I was determined to go to college.  I felt like that's where I belonged.  I didn't know why other than I enjoyed learning and I wanted to be among a learned group of people.  And I continued to work at The Varsity as I had done during my senior year in high school and I secured enough money to simply continue the second semester as I continued to work part-time jobs.

Speaker 1: At some point Morris Brown [College, Atlanta, Georgia] recognized my unique talents and I was given the opportunity to participate in a student exchange program with Miami University and that was the first time I had attended a historically white institution in the Midwest, north of the Mason-Dixon line.
Speaker 2: This is Miami University in Oxford, Ohio?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Morris Brown had a student exchange program with Miami University.  I had never heard of the school.  Then I had not heard of the school, but I later found out that it was a very wealthy school and a school that had high academic standards and I did very well there.  So you know that blew the myth that you know you go to a historically black school such as Morris Brown you cannot compete with the graduates of historic--I said no, that just isn't true cause I passed my coursework and I could have stayed had I wanted to stay.  But I wanted to return because of the racism and the cold weather and probably some other factors.  I missed my friends and I missed my family.
Speaker 2: And it was a very isolated kind of (unclear).
Speaker 1: Very isolated in the rural, a rural--
Speaker 2: Rural, yeah.
Speaker 1: --yeah in a rural area.  It was--and basically I'm a city boy and I had no real love for the rural setting like Smyrna [Georgia] or Oxford.
Speaker 2: Now you were--you graduated from high school in '62 [1962]?
Speaker 1: Yes, '62 [1962].
Speaker 2: All right.  And now when did you go to Miami?  Was it--?
Speaker 1: I believe it was during my junior year.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: My junior year.
Story_ID: 94600
Speaker 1: Now you know there were big national events going on in Oxford [Ohio] in the spring of '64 [1964].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And Western College is where they trained SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] volunteers for the freedom seminar--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --in Mississippi and there--you know it's historical footage of them in Oxford being trained and (unclear).  Were you aware of that at all?  Were you--?
Speaker 2: Well, I was partially aware of it.  Dean Stripple (ph.), a very enlightened person who introduced me to people from many different parts of the world, Palestinians who I knew nothing about.  He was a Jewish professor, administrator, and I met people from the Jewish fraternities, people I didn't know, their organizations and socializing with their people from diverse backgrounds, people who were dealing with conflict resolution issues that I knew nothing about.  Civil rights movement was in full force and many times they saw that is some of the students and teachers saw us as a resource to explain the South to the other students.  But this place was rather conservative.  I can recall the day that it was [President] Lyndon Baines Johnson who made you know the "We Shall Overcome" speech in the [U.S.] Congress and then there were white students sitting around snickering and laughing and I said, wow, you are insensitive to my presence and I'm sitting here hurting inside because of the murders and the civil rights activities from my home state?  And secondly, I actually participated in some of these civil rights marches in downtown Atlanta [Georgia].  I didn't travel throughout the South.  No I didn't do that, but those marches that took place within the city, marching against segregation.  There was a restaurant called Leb's owned by a Jewish owner [Charles Lebedin].  Well a--anyway, he was the owner of the restaurant but he adhered to racial segregation and the Klansmen were on the other side of the street from us student protesters supporting Leb's, but in fact they hated Jews but they supported this establishment's practice of racial segregation.  That was so confusing for me because many of my friends were from the Jewish Community.  They taught at our universities, they were very supportive of civil rights.  Herbert Shapiro whom I later greatly admired, he was in Atlanta at the time and it sent out a very mixed picture as a college student.  I worked at the Chevrolet Fisher Body plant as a spot welder earning my keep, paying for my, paying in part my tuition and still borrowing money, small sums of money when I should have borrowed large sums, assisting my brother who was a student at Emory [University, Atlanta, Georgia], loaning him money which was tantamount to a gift and it became a gift and so I had to work.  Fortunately I had to work because had I stayed 30 minutes longer, at this march, at the Leb's Restaurant, bear in mind that we were separated by the offices of the law, you know police, the Klan types on one side supporting the segregationist policies of Leb's and Wayne Dudley with the other students.  Most of the students from Morris Brown on the other side carrying signs saying Freedom Now and Segregation Must End, and I went to work.  When I returned to Morris Brown [College, Atlanta, Georgia] that next morning I later found out that two-thirds of those students were in jail and classes were not being conducted.  I says my god I missed it.  What a wonderful feeling.  I said, you know I don't want that on my record.  That's what I said then because I was a young man who aspired to become middle class.  I didn't want a record.  That was a, that--and my dad [Julius Dudley] said, don't you get in jail.  Don't get a record.  That's horrible. That's bad.  It would have been a badge of honor had I done so, had I been so fortunate to stay.  John L. Lewis--John Lewis [HM] was there, Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, Julian Bond [HM] who was very active at the time when he was forced to leave the Georgia State Legis--no, in fact he was not allowed to take his seat due to his controversial statements about Vietnam.
Story_ID: 94601
Speaker 1: [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] organized a rally throughout the AU Center [Atlanta University Center] and I remember very clearly. I joined that march to protest the action taken by [James H.] "Sloppy" Floyd who led the opposition against Julian Bond [HM] because I just sort of thought that it was a racist act.  I was not a pacifist then.  I am a pacifist now.  Then I even supported the war in Vietnam, not knowing the complications and the consequences initially.  But once I found that out I changed that way of behaving and the leadership.  I even remember during my junior year the Vietnam Affirmation March and we were a part of the student movement that actually supported the war in Vietnam then.  Secretary Rusk, he was Secretary of State, he was a Georgian from Coweta County.
Speaker 2: Dean Rusk?
Speaker 1: That's right, Dean Rusk.  He was highly, highly, highly respected by us.  Secondly, [President John F.] Kennedy was president and you know he was in support of the war initially and so a popular man and somewhat supportive of civil rights and who had taken a bold stand on civil rights.  So we said, well if he does this maybe he's right on the war.  But that attitude changed rather quickly after that march.  Body bags and relatives and cousins and we began to hear the voices of people like Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Toure] challenging the established black leadership, also Julian Bond, Martin Luther King spoke out against the war, Malcolm X had spoken out against the war much earlier and those messages were coming through loudly and clearly.  And now I consider myself a pacifist.  There has never been a justified--well, I don't think there was a--put it like this, I cannot imagine fighting a war 'cause I feel that most wars are unnecessary.  There are other ways to solve problems and unfortunately we're not doing that which we should be doing to avoid conflict.
Speaker 2: Now you--I don't know if this is the right time to ask you this or not.  But--maybe later I don't--or tell me about what you think.  Maybe we should go on with the chronological history--
Speaker 1: Yeah, we can go--
Speaker 2: --and not deal with this.
Speaker 1: You can throw the other issue out and then we'll--we can discuss it later.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well it was (unclear).
Speaker 1: I'm very passionate about peace.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 94602
Speaker 1: Well the question I had was as a history st--now you were a history major at Morris Brown [College, Atlanta, Georgia], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, a history major at Morris Brown, a social studies major with a history focus, teacher education.  Once I--oh yes, I also took part in the voter registration marches, in the voter registration activities as a student at Morris Brown.  Would I consider myself a civil rights leader?  No.  Civil rights follower?  Yes, I was a good follower and I'm firmly of the opinion that good followers make wonderful leaders.
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: And then at some point I had the opportunity to lead and I've led groups reasonably well or perhaps quite successfully in sending over four million books to the underserved libraries for schools (unclear).
Speaker 1: I'm going to get to that.
Speaker 2: That's leadership.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) ask you to vindicate that.  But I was--my question had something to do with the kind of history you were taught in school--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and the way history is being taught now-a-days, here in 2003.  And in a lot of places it's much different from the way it was taught in you know thirty-five, forty years ago.
Speaker 2: Very much so.
Speaker 1: And so I mean do you--what you know, I guess one of the main contradictions or the main differences I guess in the way history was taught, and especially Black American history or when we were ever mentioned at all (unclear).
Speaker 2: I think I know where you're going with this question and I will pre-empt your question by giving you the answer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If you extend to me that poetic license--
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: --and that wonderful courtesy of yours.  But in teaching over the past thirty-five years I've learned how to anticipate questions and sometimes answer the question even before the question is actually verbalized.  But you verbalized it in part and I think I can give you the answer.  Yes, the history I learned was quite different from the history that I taught less than two years ago.  There's a profound difference.  I can recall very clearly as a sixth grade student at the Rose Garden Hills Elementary School.  My teacher Mrs. Cook (ph.) taught a course on world history and I took note of the fact that most of the book dealt with western civilization.  About ten or twelve paragraphs were set aside for Africa and maybe about six or seven pages were set aside for Asia and Latin America.  But the vast majority of world history was Western Europe.  There was a subtopic for Africa, I can remember this, this episode and perhaps for the rest of my life I will share it with others.  There was a subtopic, Africa: Dark Continent.  And it just went through the pathological interpretations of Africa.  Well first of--and the lies about, well the reason why it's called the dark continent is because it was difficult for Europeans to find.  It was too dangerous, too risky and the people have black skin.  They're basically barbarians.  There is very, very little culture to be found.  Culture is seemed to bypass these people.  That was essentially what the few paragraphs conveyed to us and we sat there in this all-black school, black teachers, black administrators and I took note of the fact Ms. Cook had to give us this lesson.  But she said something else.  She said well this is one version.  These are the books that were approved by the school board for us as teachers to teach you students.  I think she said it just like that.  And but there's another side to this.  She said there were cultures in Africa that are not mentioned in this book.  Bear in mind that you know these books were approved by someone outside of our community.  These were the second or third-hand books, third-hand books that were given to us from someplace in Massachusetts so you know given to southern school districts and from white school districts then to the black school districts.  We learned to read from those books.  We learned to ask the, you know, the difficult questions.
Story_ID: 94603
Speaker 1: I grow a little frustrated at times when I listen to students say oh this is not new.  The books are not new.  They're not nice and clean.  And even from some of the poorer countries they want things to be just right and you know like for example we can't learn if it isn't just right.  And I say to them that the vast majority of Americans use secondhand books and we learned.  This--these were brilliant opportunities for the black teacher you know for the progressive, proactive black teacher to speak up and say this is what I know from articles and from other sources or from lectures that I've heard that there was culture there.  Humankind may very well have started in Africa.  So it was a different kind of history.  You had a Eurocentric version of world history.  You know the civilizations, cradle of civilization, well that's you know the white man's civilization probably came from say Iraq or you know Mesopotamia.  Now I don't think we tend to value those people very much even though their ancestors are probably the cultural bearers for that region.  But they couldn't explain Egypt and when I--of course I traveled to Egypt recently.  I see so many people of color there even now.  And historians would strongly suggest that these people in Egypt were even more Nubian types or African types during the times of the Great Pharaohs. That was not stated when I was growing up as a sixth or seventh grader.  Even when I taught at Fitchburg State College in Massachusetts, one of the more liberal professors and he was known to be liberal would often disagree with me and say well, North Africa is radically different from the sub-Saharan Africa.  The language and the culture are so different.  And I said how long has the language or culture been in place?  Was another culture and language of the people prior to this point?  And secondly, aren't some of those people still there?  But he, in his liberal way, he had a reputation of being the most liberal white professor on campus.  He was mis-educated.  So there are a lot of people who are still mis-educated even when they see the facts and some of the most recent publications and world civilizations.  And I must say to you we're closer to the truth today than we were twenty years ago and the truth opposite twenty years ago and five years ago is not being made available to us in our current history textbooks.  Yet, individuals who choose to question or choose to accept have yet to associate any real need to make fundamental changes because the past was so wrong.  They're willing to say, oh well that's wonderful that happened.  Let's move on.  Let's do what we've always done.  Control, exploit, it's good for business. You know it just goes on and on and on.  I've tried to explain to my students countless times.  I said Africa is rich in mineral resources, probably have all the minerals you need to make tires, automobile tires, bauxite--no, no, cars--anyway, not bauxite but cars and tires and then sell the weapons, not other weapons but other items including weapons.  Yet, there are no factories or very few factories manufacturing, you know making those items there.  Wonder why?  Well we're so liberal we think we should have an interracial, international, cross cultural understandings.  But what does that mean?  You attribute other skills to those people other than just being friendly and singing wonderful songs and a rich culture and a (unclear) noble history, even the history of the humankind?  Yet, it seems to fall short if not--many of these individuals seem to fall short or fail to measure up to the currency in the--well across the availability of knowledge if that's what I'm really saying.  Maybe I'm saying it poorly because I'm becoming a bit too involved.  But those frustrations exist and I prefer spending my life assisting those who are the underserved.  If you assist and help those who are underserved in the society then the entire society benefits, even those who are well served.  And I embrace all of humanity, no exceptions, no caveats, total universal acceptance.
Story_ID: 94604
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me, now you went to grad school.  When you graduated from Morris Brown [Atlanta, Georgia] you went to grad school at University of Cincinnati [Ohio] right away or did you (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well I became very ambitious after graduating from Morris Brown.  Dr. Margaret Riley (ph.), a wonderful person and a first-rate historian, very prim and proper, graduated from Hunter College [New York, New York] and of course the other school was Columbia University [New York, New York]
Speaker 1: Yeah, New York.
Speaker 2: That's right, she was a New Yorker, very prim and proper.  She could have easily taught at any school but she wanted to teach at Morris Brown College.  She suggested that I teach in one of the public schools outside of the city, but I had been accepted at the University of Georgia [Athens, Georgia] in the National Teachers Corps program, wonderful experience, gave me the opportunity to earn money and to earn a master's degree.  I wanted very much to earn the money because I wanted to purchase my mom [Ethel Hanson Dudley] and dad [Julius Dudley] their first home.  They had always been renters and I wanted them to live in a wonderful neighborhood--that I've always done.  We live in a nice neighborhood even now.  But then it was very important to me at age twenty, twenty-one.  And I was a bit I guess I felt a bit unsettled going to the University of Georgia.  First of all I was the only African American male in the program.  They wanted to put us through a special litmus test or a special testing process for admissions and I was admitted.
Speaker 1: This was 1966?
Speaker 2: Yeah, '66 [1966] yes.  Hamilton Holmes and Charlayne Hunter-Gault [HM] had then integrated the school on the undergraduate level I believe, both of whom I knew, both of whom graduated from Turner High School [Atlanta, Georgia].  They were cousins, friends of my cousins.  So this was still a very difficult time and I was admitted.  But I wanted to earn a master's degree in history so I enrolled at Atlanta University [now Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] and one of my Morris Brown professors encouraged me to speak with Dr. Clarence Bacote who was a wonderful mentor and also, and a superb human being.  So I was enrolled in two graduate programs simultaneously.
Story_ID: 94605
Speaker 1: Okay, you tell me what--
Speaker 2: So you're at two courses at--two graduate--
Speaker 1: Programs simultaneously.
Speaker 2: --programs at the same time, buy--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --your parents a house and--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --being tempted by the (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Yes.  At the University of Georgia [Athens], I could take classes at the University of Georgia campus and the university had extension courses here in the City of Atlanta [Georgia].  Andrew Young, [HM] his wife Jean [Childs] Young was my mentor.  She was my advisor, my graduate advisor at the University of Georgia, wonderful human being, truly beautiful, intellectually and physically.  She invited me to her home when Andy lived on (unclear).  This was in a three bedroom house and one bath.  He walked around with shorts on.  She would invite us over as graduate students and even then I knew that Andy had an interest in politics but I was not particularly interested myself.  We had dinner together and we talked.  But Jean was just so humane and kind, beautiful person physically and intellectually and I learned a great deal from her.  We were placed, that is after we completed our summer program, the [National] Teacher Corps program, Teacher Corps, we were assigned to schools here in the Greater Atlanta area, primarily in the inner you know the poor schools, the historically black and the poor white schools.  And I was placed at Ed--E.P. Johnson [Elementary School] and I can remember--I can easily remember Jean coming in dressed beautifully and smelling sweet and looking sweet and acting kind say, "Julius," she would call me by my first name," Julius, would you check on Stella over there.  She looks rather sleepy and tired.  You know, make sure that she's fed."  And I saw little Stella, ebony black hair, uncombed, looking sick and tired, smelling like she had slept in her own urine with other brother--or perhaps urine of her younger sisters and brothers, something that I had experienced myself.  And she said you know give her something--pick her up and--and then at some point Jean picked this little child up.  She held her.  I said now this is a woman who has stature, intellect, beauty and she could embrace a child who was hungry, sick and poorly kept.  I said that's a lesson in there for me.  Here I am in Black Aspen, you know (unclear) I aspire to become middle class.  But if I should do this who will I become?  What will I become?  Who do I want to emulate?  And it was Jean.  She wanted me to stay with the program and to earn a master's degree in the early childhood area but I knew that it was a passing interest and it's something that I will always value but it was not what I really wanted to do in life.  It was later helpful to me in life to be sure.
Story_ID: 94606
Speaker 1: And anything and all subject matters have proven to be of some value to me, even the certification course in American Military History from the West Point Academy [West Point, New York].  That was very helpful to me, a person who embraces peace at the leading institution that trains generals to fight wars.  That too is good.  There's value into any and all experiences and I was at Morris Brown College [Atlanta, Georgia] at the time that I taught for a year and I had the opportunity to go to the West Point Academy to study for a summer.  That was a good experience.  Mr. Ian Robertson, one of my history teachers at Morris Brown knew Clarence A. Bacote and he said, "you know why don't you go over and see Bacote?"  He said, "you're a bright student.  You should be in history.  I don't know why you're taking these education courses."  He had a rather condescending attitude towards educationalists.  I don't know why but then I know some of the reasons why and I think it's ill-founded because I know educationalists who are superb, intelligent people and they're invaluable when it comes to the intellectual growth of a nation. But Mr. Robertson had that attitude and which is shared by a number of individuals in the arts and sciences.  He said, "go and see Bacote and I'll give Bacote a call.  Sit in one of the classes."  And so I went over [to Atlanta University, now Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] and sat down in Bacote's class and at some point he lectured about European history, some facet of European history and I raised my hand and I started talking.  And Bacote said "oh, are you Mr. Dudley?  You're Ian Robertson's student, Dr. Dudley, I want to talk with you after class."  He was from Kansas City, Kansas and a graduate of the University of Chicago [Illinois], University of Kansas [Lawrence, Kansas] and very prim and proper type.  I said sure, Dr. Bacote I'm glad to talk.  He said "well Dr.--no, he said Mr. Dudley made application to Atlanta University?"  I said, no.  He said "well here's the application form completed and I will expect to see you in class next week."  So I started and then at some point I took the entrance exams but it was a foregone conclusion that I would earn the master's degree from Atlanta University.  I took the classes in the evenings and I took some of my classes at University of Georgia during the evenings and the weekends.  But I taught in Atlanta Public School System during the day and I balanced my schedule and I knew how many classes I should take from Atlanta University and at some point when there was a conflict for time or competition for time I decided to stay with the history degree and I dropped the early childhood education piece to the side.  I'm certified to teach early childhood education according to the statutes of Georgia.  Or at least at one point that was the case.
Story_ID: 94607
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now well what did you do next?  I mean, now at some point didn't you go to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] or--?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I wanted to earn the master's degree primarily to teach at a university or college.  A university or college, there's where I really wanted to be and I got--and I, once I completed my master's degree and [Clarence A.] Bacote was so elated that I had written a master's thesis, comparable to a dissertation he was so excited.  He said Dudley's one of the best researchers I've ever had among all of my students in say over the last twenty-five years.  He said that to me and had often shared that information with his friends.  He said you need to teach at a university.  So I taught at the University of Dayton [Ohio] once I completed my master's degree from Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia].  While there the chairperson felt like I was of the caliber to earn a Ph.D. and he said "I'll get you in touch with the people at the--some of my friends and colleagues at the University of Cincinnati [Ohio].  Some of them are teaching and some of them are colleagues here on the staff and you need to talk with them."  So I said okay I'll talk with them and spoke to Bacote and he said "oh, Dr. Herb Shapiro [Herbert Shapiro] is there.  You need to talk with him."  Said, I'll call him.  So he called Shapiro and I met with Shapiro and he said "if you want to attend the University of Cincinnati we have a student scholarship program.  You need not pay for your tuition."  I said, whoa, this is the first time I've--I said all up to this point any time I've had to pay.  And I commenced study at the University of Cincinnati in '69 [1969], '70 [1970] when I enrolled at--while I was teaching at the University of Dayton.  The following year, I accepted a position of the coordinator/director of African American studies at the University of South Florida [Tampa, Florida].  However, I continued to take classes and earn academic credits, credits for my doctoral program at the University of Cincinnati.  Some prominent people I studied--well I've studied with several prominent people but one that comes to mind was Dr. John Silver [James W. Silver] who wrote Mississippi: [The] Closed Society.  He was a colleague of mine at the University of South Florida but his courses were transferred to Cincinnati and after a period of time I completed my coursework and I commenced doing my research, completed my dissertation and I graduated in '79 [1979].
Story_ID: 94608
Speaker 1: Now you described your dissertation earlier.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah and I just wanted to point out that it was in the earlier part of this--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in case somebody was here and wanted to know what it was.  But just state what it was again.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I believe the title was, A History of the Association of Southern Women for the Prevention of Lynching, 1930-1942.  Jessie Daniel Ames was the key person that ran the organization.
Speaker 1: Can you spell her name for us?
Speaker 2: Ames, capital A-M-E-S, Jessie, J-E-S-S-I-E, Jessie Daniels, capital D-A-N-I-E-L-S.  Jessie Daniel Ames, a feminist of some sort, a suffragist who only saw liberation for a certain segment of white women but had a condescension towards black people both male and female who probably identified more with powerful white males than she did with truly liberal white women including the First Lady of the land, [President] Franklin Delano Roosevelt's wife, Eleanor Roosevelt, who in fact supported the Federal Anti-Lynch Bill.  And Jessie Daniels, a southerner, was undermining the First Lady's efforts.  So I do not have a favorable impression of her other than she represented a conservative constructive impulse in southern society.  I say that it was conservative because it was rooted in the southern system and it was progressive or positive in the sense that she thought lynchings were wrong but unwilling--and also she believed that education was the way to change the society and not through laws.  Yet she was willing to actively support the laws that were in existence, especially segregationist laws even though she railed against them, she didn't feel strongly enough to fight against them.  There is a "inconsistency" or "contradiction" that I found in her personality.  I think most people would agree to that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But then she went even further which was unconscionable.  I don't believe that the current scholarship addresses that issue.  Even Dr. [Jacquelyn Dowd] Hall who wrote a dissertation about this matter and subsequently published books, articles and books have yet to address that issue and I'm sure she's read my dissertation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, yeah as stated earlier you described this earlier.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 94609
Speaker 1: So what did you do after University of Cincinnati [Ohio]?  Now you got a Ph.D.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I had served as a Director of African American Studies at [University of] South Florida [Tampa, Florida]. I had really contributed much of my life to building that department or I should say program against heavy odds.  At some point I accepted a teaching position as opposed to just burning myself out.  I got someone else to head the program or either I acquiesced when others wanted to head it.  I was doing very well there.  I was an associate professor and tenured once I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Cincinnati, I was tenured at University of South Florida.  I always felt that there was something out there bigger and larger for me.  I had my own home in Tampa very close to the university, very nice, wonderful neighborhood, comfortable, very, very well-respected by students and faculty but there was more for me out there to do.  The salary was poor because I was so dedicated to my profession some of the administrators felt that money was not important to me and they could pay me less or just give me the minimum increase while others who were concentrating on money and publications and other--and politics I should say, heavy politics that got the salary.  So I said there's more for me out there.  And the politics didn't worry me but just going complacent and just setting my goals low began to trouble me.  Well I was troubled by that and so I said what else can I do?  I said I want to return to my alma mater since it gave me an opportunity to learn first.  I want to teach at Morris Brown [College, Atlanta, Georgia], went there for a year and they had a severe budget crisis that year and subsequently they could not offer me a contract for the second year.  So I returned to the University of South Florida.
Story_ID: 94610
Speaker 1: I heard about a graduate program at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and I applied.  I was accepted but I said oh this happened a bit too quickly.  Let me put this on hold for another year so I wrote them and told them please--thank you.  First of all thank you for the acceptance letter, but I would like to enroll next year and so that happened in '84 [1984], '85 [1985], I completed a Master's Degree from the Graduate School of Education in the area of Administration Planning and Social Policy, a second master's degree.  And I later learned a "Administrative"--well I completed a graduate program from the Harvard Extension Program, Harvard Extension in the field of administration because I just felt that the classroom is great but I wanted to do something in the field of administration and I could have a greater impact.  So Harvard was the "Administrative Piece" for me.  While there I was a part-time administrator at Boston College.  They gave me the title of Assistant Dean when in fact it was really learning on the job how to become an administrator.  And from that point I said uh, my year, my so-called sabbatical or the year I've taken away--taken off from Florida, should I return?  The answer is probably no.  I said one you've left the farm and seen the bright lights of opportunity shining elsewhere it's time to move on.  So I accepted the position at the University of Lowell, now called the University of Massachusetts at Lowell.  There were some very difficult times, the racism and the politics on the campus but I survived it, not only survived it but I did exceedingly well.  The Christian Science Monitor wrote a wonderful article about me, truly outstanding.  I never once thought it would ever happen like that.  I had increased the number of minority students on the campus.  There were only four when I arrived on campus but when I--I would say within the first year or two I had increased the number from four to about a hundred and twenty-five.  Even the president of the university recognized that I had truly did an outstanding job and that the newspapers got the story.  And one of the local U.S. Congressmen for that district read about it in the Christian Science Monitor and made it part of the--made the article a part of the U.S. Congressional Record, something I never thought possible for a person such as myself.  So I decided to stay in Massachusetts, became a tenured full professor and now a "professor emeritus" from Salem State [University, Salem, Massachusetts].  Since then I have served as the Vice President of Phelps Stokes Fund, one of the oldest operating funds in the history of the country and I'm very pleased with where I am at this point in my life.  I feel as if I can fulfill a mission that would prove to be helpful to persons who are underserved and at the same time a mission that will be a credit to all of humanity.
Story_ID: 94611
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well let me, I wanted to have you explain a little bit more about what a Phelps Stokes Fund is and who were the Phelps, who were the Stokes and when did it start and what did it do?  Because I think it, it's a pivotal organization in the history of black people in this country.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.  Well to be honest with you I heard of Phelps Stokes when I was a student at Morris Brown College [Atlanta, Georgia].  I never heard of Phelps Stokes until then.  John Hope Franklin [HM] had mentioned the name of the organization and the founders in the book entitled From Slavery to Freedom so I knew about Phelps Stokes, never once imaging that I would become a vice president at the fund.  I benefitted from one of his programs which enabled students from historically black colleges to travel to Tuskegee [Alabama] and to learn more about George Washington Carver and Booker T. Washington and their Washington experience so I was a part of that travel program so I know about Phelps Stokes for a second and third time.  Phelps Stokes was a--was established in 1911.  Caroline Phelps Stokes who was the person, was the family member who was so committed to the uplifting of people of color, not only in Africa but (unclear) not only uplifting the people in America, people of color, black people in America but black people in Africa as well.  There were also indications that she wanted to assist destitute whites, you know people who were in need, who had true needs.  She was a humanitarian, somewhat of a religious person I would say, possibly so.  She had some South African roots which I found out very recently.  I found out some other interesting points about her life, but she was single, she's the one who set aside a large sum of money, several hundreds of thousand dollars to establish the fund.  And the organization was a part of several studies and that made recommendations to the government as well as other foundations.  It became a "operating fund", one that would bring together deals to coordinate spending to help supervise the spending, to help evaluate, to act as a "convener" of prominent people, people of influence like the Rockefellers, the Carnegies.  They stuck with those people and they made recommendations about where money should be spent, where money is being spent well.  They were among the power elite.  The Phelps Stokes Fund has been at the forefront of a number of critical changes, not only in this country but in Africa, South Africa, sitting at the first say interracial council involving blacks and whites in South Africa, building schools there during the 1920s and 30s [1930s], trying their very best to get the white leadership to treat Africans as human beings worthy of learning, advancement and Christianity.  Phelps Stokes has undergone a series of difficulties over the past twenty or thirty years, have some--had some very high points under certain presidents, key presidents, one who was very Pan-Africanist and others, one other person who was very ill and seemed not to have had the energy or the commitment to make it move forward.  Most of the leaders of Phelps Stokes since the first one who headed the organization are African Americans or persons who could--persons who had African American blood.  That's all I can say at this point but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but I can say far more.
Speaker 1: Okay (unclear).
Speaker 2: But you can give me a few leads and I can give you more information.
Speaker 1: Yeah, as Vice President of Phelps Stokes Fund, what do you do?  What do you do there?
Speaker 2: Run programs, I've done some administrative work.  I serve at the will of the president, whatever he asks me to do.  The special assignments I do them but my designated duties are to coordinate programs and to add--to assist him with the administration of the fund.
Story_ID: 94612
Speaker 1: Okay.  So would I be right by saying, if I said that you basically helped him [the president of the Phelps Stokes Fund] assess you know where funds are needed or where they should go--?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I make recommendations.  I also follow his recommendations and I've been known to "initiate" programs and bring them to the fund and the fund has actively supported me on some of the programs.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Especially when we have the money to do stuff, we don't have the money to give me support but--verbal support but if the money is not there we cannot act on some of them.  We live in difficult times.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well what activities have you been most proud of in regards to the Phelps Stokes Fund?
Speaker 2: It is the continuation of the work I've done in Africa for more than ten years.  I believe Phelps Stokes wanted me to come on board because I had demonstrated my ability to run a "successful" program that is sending books as well as other educational items to the underserved schools and libraries of Africa.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I have done this--
Speaker 1: So you started doing this ten years ago?
Speaker 2: Yes, at least ten years ago, probably more like eleven years ago.  I organized my own nonprofit organization.  I'm the founding President of the Collaborative Education with South Africans and I had sent over two million books before I joined Phelps Stokes.  I had also sent books to Angola and Ethiopia.  And since I've joined Phelps Stokes I've sent books to Ghana and another African country called Zimbabwe.  So I'm very proud of the fact that Phelps Stokes has provided the bully pulpit or the forum from which I could continue my work and fulfill or to fully implement my passion.
Story_ID: 94624
Speaker 1: Oh, I was getting ready to ask you about your programs when you start--how you started your programs and book programs and--
Speaker 2: Okay, the book project [Collaborative Education with South Africans].
Speaker 1: The book projects and did you have to go out and find a board of directors to do this or do you have a group of people that you got interested in this, students get involved in it?  How did it work 'cause I know it wasn't just you, you had to get some other people in it, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I was a tenured full professor at Salem State College [Salem, Massachusetts].  I had just arrived on the campus in 1992 and the chairperson of the department made some friendly gesture about some, said oh we have all these extra history books in the office and we need to get rid of them.  Perhaps we could send them some of those schools down south.  And since I was the only southerner in the room and black person, I believed at the time that she was being generous and--but I knew that she was totally unaware of the new conditions of the South but I accepted the books.  I later spoke with Bishop McKinley Young, one of my classmates at Morris Brown [College, Atlanta, Georgia], A.M.E. Minister who was based in Cape Town, South Africa and I was looking for a place to send the books and I knew that most of the schools in the South had books that were far more advanced than those that were being offered to me.  So I spoke to McKinley and said, is there a need for books in the New South Africa.  He said yes, and I sent him 600 and he said we need more.  And he said I would like to ask the point of "distribution".  I said, fine, I'll do it.  I had a graduate assistant, a young, white male, Scott Strange is his name and he worked with me in part.  He had affiliations with the local high schools in Salem, Massachusetts.  I also had connections at the Beverly Schools, that is the country, Shore Country Day School in Beverly [Massachusetts], sort of class--private school for well-to-do white children.  And so from that point, we collected the first books and since I lived in Boston at the time I contacted my friends at some of the local schools and we generated a few thousand books.  I contacted one of the columnists at The Boston Globe who later became a very good friend and I told him about the book project in South Africa and so he wrote a very nice article about the project.  And the article appeared in The Boston Globe on May 1st, 1994.  There were at least two or three hundred telephone calls made to Salem State College asking how can we help this professor send books to Africa?  And from that point I had a cause that I truly embraced, sending books to those who had the greatest need.  That's the core of Wayne Dudley, to address needs.  To--it's to serve others and I know that the essence of greatness is service and if there is any greatness to be accrued it is through service.  And I said I like doing this and I said you know perhaps I can do one million books by year 2000.  I got other people, young people, teachers, principals involved in the project.  Many of the children from working class white neighborhoods, well-to-do white neighborhoods wanted to organize book drives and I in turn generated a lot of publicity for them and they got a lot of coverage in their newspapers and local television programs.  And I saw the value into getting student involvement and across--into cross cultural experiences to be shared by people of--from all walks of life and so this was very appealing to me.  Within less than three years I had reached my goal up to one million books by year 1996.  And I said, well I'll do two million by year 2000.  So I increased my goal and I had another theme and another goal and by year 2000, I had done two million books and knocking at the door at three million.  So it is something that I've thoroughly enjoyed working with others and doing myself.
Story_ID: 94625
Speaker 1: I organized my own nonprofit organization and I used it as a bully pulpit, not necessarily for fundraising.  I was very bad, poor at raising money so I'd end up spending my own money.  I would spend over a $100,000 of my own personal funds to make sure that the books were shipped, books were--that books were collected and shipped to Africa.  When others saw me doing this, they too made contributions.  You lead by example.  Young people would do it.  Book buyers, persons such as librarians and teachers would say you know this man is giving a great deal.  I can call him at home.  I gave my telephone number out.  It was in The Boston Globe several times so anyone who wanted to make a book donation or any kind of donation could contact me.  I was--I became totally immersed in the book project, I taught full-time.  I maintained a high standard for all my students not only in the classroom but outside the classroom.  I became very popular on campus by most.  Some of my colleagues saw me as a thorn in their side for multiplicity reasons, jealousy, anger, frustration, whatever, even racism.  But I felt good about what I was doing.  Raising money was not my forte.  It was just too much for me to rub shoulders and go to all of the wine and cheese parties and feel cow-tied to people who did not have the interests of the "people" at heart.  I mean like giving them something in their hands without tying strings and ropes to their necks.  To learn the, you know the virtue of giving without getting something back, to learn how to share to a point that it takes something of substance from you, you know the giver.  If it meant giving up my suits for two years and I have 30 suits, do I need two or four, two to four more suits to add to my collection of suits?  Should I just buy four suits every year or you know use the ones that I have and then give the rest to the book project?  Should I have to purchase a new car every three years?  No.  I can drive the same automobile for seven years and the money that would accrue from the savings, I could use it or at least $4,000 of it to send another 40 foot container of books to South Africa.  And I could send the books.  There were many people like me who wanted to send books but who held onto their books for years and years because they would not spend their own money" to make sure the books were sent.  As my father [Julius Dudley] would say, you can make a mouth say anything, can make a mouth say anything but to put your shoulders to the wheel to do it is another issue."  Some people talk about faith but work is faith.  Where there is no work there is no faith.  Work must accompany faith.  It must accompany faith, otherwise you have no faith.  You can talk about Jesus Christ died for me on the cross and blood saved me and all, but if you do not put that faith into practice, then you have no faith in what you're saying.  I'm a Christian, but I see the universality of God in ways that have yet to be explained to me fully.  I let God do God's business and I will try to do the business of God as I perceive it.
Story_ID: 94626
Speaker 1: And as far as I'm concerned, as far as I'm concerned, I have no time to play with others or to play silly games raising money when I can do it on my own.  [The] Phelps Stokes [Fund] recognized this commitment of mine and they know I'm very serious about what I do.  This is my mission. This is my niche in life and hopefully I will do this for the rest of my life if it's God's will.  Others talk commitment.  I talk it, but I do it.  And I want to do more and I want to do a better job of it.  So my nonprofit organization served as a way to raise money but I would put my own money into it.  If others wanted to make book donations and I have hundreds of people who have made book, if not thousands who have made book donations.  Just before I left Boston [Massachusetts] yesterday I made arrangements to pick up 200 boxes of mathematics and science books and also yeah, those books.  And I have a book buyer who has worked with me for seven years and all the books that he cannot sell, then he gives them to me and many of these books were published 2001, 2002.  When I go to a number of African universities and colleges they have books that were published during the 1980s as the most current publications.  Those are the most current publications.  So I can do a better job than that.  And these books are quality books.  These are books that are used at some of our very best universities and colleges.  Two weeks from now I will go to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] to the Harvard Business School and I will collect over 1,000 books and I will make sure that they are put in the next 40 foot container and sent to one of the African universities or colleges.  I can do this with or without Phelps Stokes.  I can do this with say, with or without fifty chief donors or five donors or one donor.  Some things we can do ourselves and when you are committed to doing something for others and there are many wonderful people out there who will come to your aid and assist you.  There are countless ways, whether it's a donation of 200 boxes of books or this person from Harvard or BU [Boston University, Massachusetts] who is offering me 4,000, or whether it's Ron Masiello with the International Rotary Club who will put his truck on the road and actually collect these books for me and put them in storage or whether it's Wayne Dudley who will hire--who will get a truck and go to these places and make sure that those books are placed on a truck.  I've done that too.  So it has been a wonderful experience of me and like-minded people who care about others and I inspire others to do the same.  And I'm no better than anyone else I've met, you know.  All of us have these qualities and impulses to serve others.
Story_ID: 94627
Speaker 1: Now there was a, I think it was 1991, I believe it was.
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: There was a minister in Boston [Massachusetts] who issued a challenge to especially the black intellectuals of the Boston area that were making quite a bit of money and in charge of black studies programs at all the different universities.  His name is Eugene Rivers [HM].  He wrote a book, I mean a paper called [On] the Responsibility of Black Intellectuals in the Age of Crack, I think it was, and it caused a big stir and there was a big conference held to publicize it.  It was broadcast on public television and you know, he--about you know what people were really doing, what responsibility black intellectuals was in a time of crisis, you know even though they seemed to be living in amongst plenty at the time.  They were living in an age of crisis.  Did--do you remember that (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I'm not aware of the conference.  It does not ring a bell at this moment.  I may very well have heard of it at the time.  I met Eugene Rivers, Reverend Eugene Rivers.  I do not know him.  I've heard about--well I've heard from others who claim that they know him and others who--and some of them seem not to think well of him.  I'm sure that the Reverend Rivers heard about me.  There were at least fifteen articles in The Boston Globe about my project.  There were other newspapers, Bay State Banner, Christian Science Monitor and countless other newspapers, probably a hundred or more articles were written about my project.  There were news clippings and radio coverage of the various shipments and I never received one letter or one call from Reverend Rivers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  He may not even have been aware of it, I don't know.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: But it was interesting though--
Speaker 2: --our--
Speaker 1: --that you started, your project was started--
Speaker 2: I'm just saying that to you.
Speaker 1: --at the same time that he was saying that people ought to take an interest and you had already started now (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes.  And I'm just saying to you--
Speaker 1: --on your own.
Speaker 2: Yes, but I'm simply saying that you can make a mouth say anything but action is another issue.  I met him in '95 [1995], but we never really talked about this project and he had other more pressing concerns.  I just find it just a bit interesting that after all this publicity and I mean huge amounts of publicity from this project, I never heard from him once.
Speaker 1: I mean his interests are more domestic ,I guess?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm, yeah I guess so.
Speaker 1: But there's a big conference, Cornell (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm aware.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) showed up at this.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And people doing public television and everybody's trying to respond to it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: Boston's a very interesting place.  That's all I'll say to you about that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Very interesting.
Story_ID: 94628
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Hopes and concerns about the black community.  I'm the incurable optimist.  And I've seen so many wonderful people throughout my life who have given so much and many of them are still around, still giving, still making contributions who are caring.  They not only care about the black community but they care about the total community.  And we are as a black community, a part of that total community which is a global community.  At times I grow a tad bit weary in spite of all my optimism that many times we are terribly concerned about our own and loving our own, but failing to see ourselves in other people.  It's so easy for my brother to love his children and his grandchildren but can he love his brother's children?  Can he see a bit of himself in the children of his own brother?  This seems to be a problem not only for African Americans but for people who are basically parochial, people who are basically self-centered and selfish.  They do not see themselves as a part of the totality of humanity.  We cannot afford that reckless, mindless strategy, we as a powerless people constituting less than twenty percent of the total population in this country.  We need leadership with a new vision and a new commitment not only to people of color but surely have people of color and charity begins at home.  But if you have no charity at home and you have no charity abroad then there is no charity coming from you.  I've heard it said many times by my students who say to me, Dr. Dudley, oh you're well-to-do.  You have a Ph.D.  You have graduate grades from Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  You own property.  You're, you are well set.  You have enjoyed recognition on two continents.  You're (unclear) you've come a long ways, and I have.  And I thank God for those many blessings.  But too many of our youth are inclined to want that which is at the end of the process as opposed to walking through the process and learning the beauty of the struggle and the learning that takes place.  They want it now as opposed to earning it now and that may prove to be counterproductive in a world that is going through a transformation that I have yet to fully understand with globalization, etc., etc.  Where does that fit in?  Where do we fit in?
Story_ID: 94629
Speaker 1: However, I remain incurably optimistic because as an American citizen and I am an American citizen, probably seven generations, we are a hard-working people, we are a people who are self-centered, we are a people who are focused on what we need, what we want, we will ask some of the difficult questions and hopefully act on them correctly.  These are reasons why I'm optimistic.  I see this among many of our youth.  In Salem [Massachusetts], I was honored yesterday by the youth of Salem because of the book project.  These are young people, juniors in high school who gave me a special award.  They asked me, what can I do, Dr. Dudley, to make a difference?  How can I make the world a better place and make sure that none of the good in the world is lost while we're making it a better place?  And I said oh, I have some ideas, can build the kinds of "relationships" with the people throughout the world.  I said I see humanity in every corner of the world where I travel.  I said, when I was in Ghana I went to one of the villages and there were about 300 people present and I needed a translator.  Most of the people understood some form of English or a certain amount of English but still we--I wanted them to fully understand, not just have a partial understanding.  And I said to them, you're very fortunate.  You're very fortunate.  I said you stand on the shoulders of others who came before you.  Yes, you are barefooted, yes your clothes are torn and tattered, yes there's a need for more food and there's a need for books and there's a need for computers.  But I said you're very fortunate.  You have life, you have youth, you have vitality and you have a tradition deeply rooted in the traditions of a Kwame Nkrumah, who by the way had less than you, and he built a nation.  I said he inspired me when I was a college student at Morris Brown [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  He was my fraternity brother who became the African President.  I said wow, that's great.  And I said this man has courage and integrity and I'm very pleased that he inspired me.  You must do the same.  You must build on his legacy.  I said you can do far greater deeds than I could ever accomplish in this life.  I said my time is just about over.  I said well another fifteen or twenty years, you will be in a leadership--you will play a leadership role and I only want to make a contribution to that process.  And I believe that the black community will truly embrace these core values of inclusion and kindness and generosity of the heart.  This is a part of my incurable optimism.
Story_ID: 94630
Speaker 1: I can say far more and hopefully I've not said too much but if you have another question I will do my very best to address them.
Speaker 2: Well I--we do have a couple more.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: And one is, at this juncture, what would you consider as your legacy?
Speaker 1: My legacy is a progress--how can I say it.  It's a making--well of course (unclear), my legacy is still evolving.  It's--my legacy will probably stand out clearly in the field of education whether it's nationally or whether it's international, probably international education.  My legacy will come in that area because I've, because I take it very seriously and I enjoy doing it and there is a greater need for it, if there is a legacy for me.  It's interesting to note that even my students in Florida and Massachusetts have said to me in recent years, Dr. Dudley, you really made an impression on my life ten years ago.  One young man took me out to lunch two days ago and said if it not--said, if it had not been for you I wouldn't be where I'm sitting today now.  I have a wife and two children, I have my own business.  I said what did I do?  I said to myself, did I really do that much?  I said, maybe I did.  I stood up--I stayed up at nights, one and two o'clock in the mornings to assist students in writing their papers, by teaching them how to write papers, spending my time, my money.  And that was hard but it was valued.  I've assisted students through the doctoral, master, graduate programs.  Some have cited my name simply expressed appreciation in their final product saying that Dr. Dudley was a critical piece in my success throughout graduate school.  It's nice to hear.  But my legacy will probably grow out of the little faces I've seen who will probably forget my name but know that this was the man who came to my village and spoke to us, who waved to me and said I could do better, whether it's written in books or it manifests itself, or this legacy manifests itself in awards, I don't know.  It's a progress still in the making.  I guess if only one angel in heaven should whisper my name and said he tried to do something good for somebody in his life, his life was worth living.  That's my legacy.
Story_ID: 94620
Speaker 1: We have one last question.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?  Similar to legacy, but a little bit different.
Speaker 2: How would I like to be remembered?  I'd like to be remembered as a person who truly cared about others, a person who would be willing to give something of worth and substance from his own existence and comfort to ensure that others who are less fortunate could enjoy a better quality of life.  I would like to be remembered as kind and generous, thinking perhaps if I were in a state of need that if I truly needed someone to help me that I would feel comfortable in going to another person that shared many of my attributes and know that this person would care and would act on his care, caring qualities and become generous to help me if I were truly in need.  I would want to be remembered as a person who loved humanity, who can see a little piece of myself in everyone and know that they too are a part of the human family and should be treated accordingly without exceptions, no qualifications.  As stated in the Negro National Anthem, I want to be true to my God and true to my native land.  And I've been very blessed.  Words cannot describe my source of strength during difficult days, months and years.  I would hope that I would certainly radiate the values of the creator that made us all.  To be true to your god and true to your native land is important.  This is how I would like to be remembered.  To be witty, yes but wit can only take you so far.  To be loving, sometimes that gets in the way of progress.  It can be stymieing.  It can blind you.  It can create a bit of selfishness to love only those people who love you.  The true test is when you can love someone who doesn't particularly love you and transform them into a better person.  That's love.  I seek no--seek not so much to be loved as to love.  I seek not so much to be consoled as to do what, console.  I would like to be remembered as a person who tried to do something good and wonderful for others knowing at the same time that I'm benefitting immensely for each step along the way.  I might crumble and say this isn't working my way, this isn't moving fast enough.  But in my heart of hearts when I go to bed at night and know that something to advance the cause of good and righteousness in the world whether I'm aware of it or not, but to know that probably something I've done today will have a beneficial impact that will hopefully contribute to the ongoing righteousness and humanity of the world.
Story_ID: 94621
Speaker 1: How would I like to be remembered?  I would like to leave it up to the historians to answer that question in part since I'm a historian and they're the ones who usually determine how one should be remembered.  And I guess this is part of the verdict that will be rendered at some point in the near or distant future.  But that's one of my least concerns.  It's one of my least concerns 'cause I'm so busy strategizing and thinking of new ways to do better at what I am doing.  How can I perform at my optimum level, am I doing it well, am I falling short?  Those are my concerns.  But I would hope and pray that I would be judged with the kindness and the generosity that only our creator could extend to us for I believe that the creator would be kinder to us as human beings than we human beings could ever prove to be kind to one another.  I guess I haven't given it very much thought.  I listen to what other people say about me and I guess my legacy and what I think and then what I want others to think about me will live on in the hearts of others and they may very well tell you--well they may very well serve as the verdict.  You know they will give the final verdict.  I'm just lost in a way to answer that question but I've given you three or four responses to how I would like to be remembered.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Doing God's work on earth.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right, well thank you sir.
Speaker 1: Thank you.

Speaker 1: This is the youth everyone called Wayne.  He was about four years old.  And I was the eldest child of nine children.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) chronological order later.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).  Okay.
Speaker 1: This is another picture of me.  I was Professor Dudley at the University of South Florida [Tampa, Florida].  I was the director and a professor of African American Studies.  On this picture I was twenty-nine years old.  I was celebrating a rather momentous event on campus where my students honored me, that is the African American students honored me as being their faculty member of--
Speaker 2: This is a picture at which time I was called Dr. Dudley.  These were some of the books that I had sent, books that I had collected that were to be sent to South Africa, 1995.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: This was a picture of me when I was the student minority director at U-Mass Lowell [University of Massachusetts at Lowell].  And I was honored by the YMCA and a special program called Black Achievers.  And the picture was taken in 1986.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.
Speaker 2: This picture is one of happiness and joy, dancing on the cruise ship called the King of the Thebes, King of the Thebes--King of Thebes, I'm sorry, King of Thebes, year 2003.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, next.
Speaker 2: That's in Luxor, Egypt.
Speaker 1: Luxor, Egypt.
Speaker 2: Okay.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay, next picture.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of me with Archbishop Desmond Tutu.  This picture was taken in 1995.  The Archbishop has endorsed the book project [Collaborative Education with South Africans] on several occasions, probably three times in the states and twice in South Africa. I've sent over three million books to the underserved schools and libraries of South Africa.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of me at the Georgia State Capitol, 2002.  I was asked to make a presentation about my book project and my position at Phelps Stokes.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay great, next.
Speaker 1: Here is another picture of me standing at the podium at the Georgia State Capitol Building, same year 2002.  This was a rather momentous occasion for me, for I had never visited the State Capitol nor had I ever been asked to make a presentation in the presence of the Georgia State Senators.
Speaker 2: Here is a picture of me with my mother [Ethel Hanson Dudley], my father [Julius Dudley] and sister.  They were with me at the Georgia State Capitol during year 2002.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Hold on a second. Okay very good, next.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of me demonstrating my love for life at age fifty.  For fleeting millisecond I was narcissistic and I was partially clothed.  There were other photos taken but this is one that is presentable.  I was fifty years old.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 94623
Speaker 1: This picture was taken in 1994 in Salem, Massachusetts. Archbishop Desmond Tutu visited the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and he took pictures with the children who had made book contributions to my project which was established in 1992.  There were at least 10,000 young people involved in this project over a period of ten years.  Emily Kumpel was one of them.  She was recommended to the key advisors at the Oprah Winfrey Show based in Chicago [Illinois] and so all of us were very excited.  Emily's mother asked me if I could generate a picture involving Emily, myself and Archbishop Desmond Tutu.  We, as well as many citizens in Wakefield, Massachusetts watched Oprah that afternoon and unfortunately when I saw the program like the rest of them, we took note of the fact that my head and hands were literally blanked out of the picture.  It's interesting to note that I didn't make the Oprah Show but those hands and heads are pushed through formally in books to the underserved schools and libraries of South Africa.  Emily was about eight years old.
Speaker 2: How do you spell Emily's last name?
Speaker 1: Kumpel, K-U-M-P-E-L.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (BRIEF INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Porter Versfelt.  Observing is Scott Stearns.  Sir, could you please state your name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 1: My name is Dr. Julius Wayne Dudley, Julius, J-U-L-I-U-S, Wayne, W-A-Y-N-E, Dudley, D-U-D-L-E-Y.
Speaker 2: And what is your occupation?
Speaker 1: I've worked in higher education in Massachusetts.  I'm now Emeritus Professor.  I've worked as vice president of programs, administration, Phelps Stokes Fund.  I've also worked at other--I've been employed at other institutions in Florida, University of South Florida [Tampa], Georgia, Morris Brown College [Atlanta, Georgia]; in Ohio, University of Dayton; in Massachusetts, Salem State [Salem], Emerson College [Boston], Boston College, University of Massachusetts, Lowell.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 1: Today's date is August the 15th, 2003.
Speaker 2: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 1: We are at my home in the City of Atlanta, my second home.  I reside in Massachusetts but this is considered my second home but in fact my birth place and it is home.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right, so we, what we're doing we're continuing a photo session we started back in May or so.  And so could you describe this photo for us?
Speaker 1: This is another photo op with Archbishop Desmond Tutu who wanted to be among the young people, persons who had been a part of the grassroots efforts to send books to South Africa's most needy schools and libraries.  He was very excited, very eager to meet with the young people.  Some of the university college officials thought it was inappropriate, yet the good Bishop through some of my friends in South Africa knew exactly what the Bishop wanted to do and so we made it happen.  And these young people are from the inner city school in Boston [Massachusetts], Madison Park High School, then known as one of the more difficult, unruly schools but yet these young people too--
Speaker 2: What date is this?
Speaker 1: This was 1994.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is a photo at the Boston City Hall.  Councilman [Charles] Yancey invited groups of young people, groups of students from the inner city schools, Boston and the students from the suburban communities of Wakefield [Massachusetts] but primarily from the Country, Shore Country Day School [Beverly, Massachusetts] which was a rather exclusive little New England School.  And many of these students were from wealthy backgrounds, some even came from Marblehead, Massachusetts.  And so we had a great cross section of young people who wanted to make a difference in the world.  And so these arrangements were made for them to come to City Hall.  Proclamations were issued.  I understand that the mayor of the city was very anxious to come downstairs to find out what was going on and subsequently he organized a book drive to help the poor people of Boston to have books within our rich city, rich, affluent city.  His book drive didn't make too much of a dent but ours did.
Speaker 2: What year is this?
Speaker 1: Nineteen ninety-four [1994].
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Yeah right, right.  They were looking at me with such intensiveness, you know the faces.  That was very impressive.  And I said, my god you really looked good for an old man, but no, no, no back to the real deal.  These were well-to-do young men from a prep school in KwaZulu-Natal.  These students were a part of the book project to help those students from Umlazi which was one of the townships in the KwaZulu-Natal Province, Durban.  This is located Durban, wealthy children helping poor children in the rural villages.  I was about fifty-two years old.  I believe this picture was taken in 1998, Durban, South Africa, KwaZulu-Natal Province.  I love to say KwaZulu-Natal.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It sounds--yeah, KwaZulu with--and I went to the Kraal where Shaka Zulu lived.  Okay, this is another group of students, this is in the Essex County area, a part of my group of volunteers, the principal of the school along with a few of the parents.  This scene was seen with parents, students and teachers can be multiplied perhaps a thousand times in several parts of the country including Atlanta--
Speaker 2: --in Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, several sessions, gatherings took place like this and students were very enthusiastic about doing something good and wonderful to help other children in other parts of the world, children helping children making a better world for all, not only the youth but for those of us who are older.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is a photo with the Cardinal of Angola, Congressman Kenny, Kennedy, Joseph Kennedy, congressman from Massachusetts.  I contributed over 50,000 books to the Catholic University of Angola [Luanda, Angola] and the cardinal was very pleased.  He invited me to his country which I accepted as an invitation and I saw firsthand the use of those books.  This article appeared in The Pilot magazine or The Pilot newspaper which is the official organ of the Catholic Church for Massachusetts if not most of New England.  It's a rather prestigious publication.
Speaker 2: So he was the Archbishop of Uganda or the Cardinal of Uganda?
Speaker 1: Cardinal of Angola.
Speaker 2: Angola.
Speaker 1: Angola.  At that time Angola was in the grips of a civil war and troops were literally stationed outside of our hotel.  And at nights we could see the gunfire and the rebels approaching.  And now today Angola is more or less at peace which is good.  And the books are there and perhaps all in all I sent over 100,000 books to Angola.  Many of the books, I would say at least 50 percent of the books were sent to Congressman Kennedy's library or the library that was named in honor of his brother Michael Kennedy who died prematurely due to an accident and so the Kennedy family contributed money to the building of the University as well as the library.
Speaker 2: This is a group--this represents a group of students who benefitted directly from the books.  Many of these students lived in the villages and on numerous occasions, probably exceeding a thousand times, I've visited small villages of this sort where the young people were very eager to pick up their share of the books or to go to the library and/or the school to read.  This is in South Africa, 1998, during the month of June.  It's very cold in South Africa during the month of June and that's the reason why they're dressed as they are.
Speaker 1: Everybody thinks Africa is hot all (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know and that's a bit of misinformation that is widespread.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of myself at the Massachusetts State House.  There were at least three thousand volunteers who had made a contribution to the book project and there I'm standing at the podium.  This was in 1995, the Massachusetts State House.  General--yes, it's the Massachusetts State House, 1995.  Governor [William] Weld was scheduled to arrive.  He was then the Governor of Massachusetts.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, you're going to set that around or--?
Speaker 2: (BRIEF INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: This is a scene at the Georgia State Capitol Building.  This took place in 2002.  I was very pleased to be honored with a proclamation at the Georgia State Capitol.  Many have said that a prophet is never accepted in his own village or say from his own town.  This was a highlight.  I had been honored in Tampa, Florida, Massachusetts, Boston, several cities and towns, the U.S. Congress but never in Georgia.  Lieutenant Governor Taylor actually presided there and I have other photos.  This is a picture of my mother who is standing next to me.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  This is your mother [Ethel Hanson Dudley]?
Speaker 1: Yes, my mother and my father who was then very ill but he was very anxious to go to the state building.  His name is Julius Dudley and it was just a real fun morning.
Speaker 2: Who is this on the end?
Speaker 1: That's my sister Montay Dudley Baker.
Speaker 2: This also represents a group of students who generated over 5,000 books in a place called Waltham, Massachusetts, Waltham, Massachusetts.  These students were very diverse in their cultural and racial background.  Some were born in the Dominican Republic, very poor country, others were from the middle class, upper middle class background in Massachusetts.  But these were young people who felt a kinship with other young people throughout the world.  Perhaps in this life my role has been to serve as a catalyst to get young people to help other young people and hopefully make for a better world.  This was in year 1997.
Speaker 1: And this is where it all started.  This is a baby picture.  I was about six months old.  This picture was probably taken in 1995.  No, I'm sorry, 1940--this picture was taken, let me start over again.  I am really fudging there when I said 1995.  This picture was probably taken in 1945.  I was about six months old.  My mother was very proud of the fact that she had a baby boy, her first child.  She would often say that she would look at me and say this is going become my doctor.  She wasn't too far from the mark.  She was then about twenty-four or twenty-five.  She was twentyfive at that point and I was six months old.
Speaker 2: Okay, what year would this be?
Speaker 1: Nineteen forty-five [1945].  I was born in 1944, October the 29th so six months later that would have been 1945.
Speaker 2: Not 1995.  That would have really been a meteoric rise.
Speaker 1: Yeah, uh-huh.  You notice I caught that one rather quickly.  So no, let me start over again.  This is another visitation I made to one of the grammar schools working with young people whether here in Massachusetts or Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Hampshire, just traveling on the road serving as a catalyst for the book project.  This picture was taken in 1996.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.
Speaker 1: Now you need to frame this one before (unclear).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Put it in a frame.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  A man and his books.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah.  This picture was taken by one of the photographers at The Boston Globe.  It was published in The Boston Globe magazine.  They wanted this picture to be authentic so they asked me if I would take them to one of the warehouses where the books were located.  So this was a set up for me to sit among a "jungle of books."  In the background there were at least a half million books in this warehouse.  This picture was taken in New Bedford, Massachusetts, one of the warehouses where I stored books to be sent to South Africa and later to Ethiopia and Angola, Ghana, South Africa, Namibia.  So this was a very important place.  This picture was taken in year 2000, I believe it was 2000.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay.
Speaker 1: Boston Globe magazine article.  I can give you a precise date on that.  This is one of seventeen articles published by The Boston Globe.  It was instrumental in making the book project a major force among New England contributors.  The Christian Science Monitor also ran a photo article in--a very nice article much sooner.  That was in 1993, '94 [1994].  But this was a Boston Globe magazine article.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  And Larry, if you check the back if it's a print from them it might--usually stamp them with you know the paper or the day or something.
Speaker 1: Yes, double check that.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Was that year 2000?
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: My eyes are bad too.  I believe it was year 2000.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Yeah, Boston Globe photographed--just said you're not supposed to reproduce--there's a number, 02107. I don't think that's a date.  It didn't completely print very well.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it didn't--
Speaker 2: Well then if you give me the article, the article--
Speaker 1: June--July 12th, 1998.
Speaker 2: Nine--1998, I'm sorry.  I missed it by two years, 1998.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  All right, anything else?
Speaker 2: I was just wasn't sure about that one, yeah 1998.
Speaker 1: Mr. Dudley is there anything else?
Speaker 2: I guess not.
