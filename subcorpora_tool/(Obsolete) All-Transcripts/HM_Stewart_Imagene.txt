Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [J.C. Bigham] side of the family, but we'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: Mattie Watkins, W-A-T-K-I-N-S.
Speaker 1: M-A-T-T-I-E?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.

Speaker 2: No, she died--
Speaker 1: At--okay.
Speaker 2: At ninety-six.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what, about what year?  Do, do you remember?
Speaker 2: About five years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  All right, well, what do you know about--was she born in--
Speaker 2: Dudley, Georgia, Dudley.
Speaker 1: Dudley, okay, not Dublin [Georgia]--
Speaker 2: D-I-D-L-E-Y [sic.].
Speaker 1: --but Dudley, okay.
Speaker 2: Dudley, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay, Dudley, Georgia.  Is Dudley near Dublin?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now, what do you know about the ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back can you trace your heritage on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Really not that far back, because I guess during those days we really didn't do the stuff they do now, genealogy and all that stuff.  We didn't do that back then.  But I know my mama's side of the family, they were real light.  They--most folks thought they were white on her side of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any stories about why?  Did they ever talk about why they were so light?
Speaker 2: Well, I had--my mama had two daughters before she married my daddy.  And they would always tell me that their daddy was white.  That's why they all were light, because of the farm they grew up on.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this is, these are people are your contemporaries, right?  Or--I mean they're the same age as you or similar in--
Speaker 2: They were older than me.
Speaker 1: Older than you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because when daddy married mama, as I said, she had two children already, two daughters.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my daddy had five children by his first wife.
Speaker 1: Let, let me ask you, are there any stories from your mother's side of the family about the way things were like back in the, say the 19th century, back--any stories about slavery, the Civil War, or any of that?
Speaker 2: My people--my mother's people were light skinned, and they did not talk about slavery.  The only time I remember was my mama's sister saying when James Brown say, "I'm black and I'm proud."  We wasn't allowed to sing it ['Say It Loud, I'm Black and I'm Proud'].
Speaker 1: Oh, 'cause she didn't--
Speaker 2: They didn't, they didn't believe it, no.
Speaker 1: So they, they were against--
Speaker 2: That's right, 'cause they--
Speaker 1: --black skin color?
Speaker 2: --were light.  That's right, yes they were.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: And 'cause I remember when I was little, they would have a pick on me because I was dark skinned, and they were light skinned.  And I think that kind of ran through me over the years, is because all my mother's side of the family were light skinned.  It's just, it was just the way it--and they just picked on darker people.
Story_ID: 629850
Speaker 1: So, you know, people don't talk about that that much now.  They don't say that much about it.  But was that, you know, pretty common in those days, that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --people felt that way?
Speaker 2: Yes, and even in, in, in high school [Oconee High School, Dublin, Georgia].  I think it had an, an effect on me, that my sisters, they would always walk in front of me, so to speak, and I would always be behind them.  And it's just, it was just like that because you were dark skinned.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you think they thought they were better 'cause they were light (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sure, absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now did they get treat, treated any, any better by white people because of that?
Speaker 2: I, I don't think so, because I remember when I started the movement.  I started the civil rights in Dublin, Georgia, because of Dr. Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  I wrote him a letter, and told him how I was treated.  I said--and, and I, I will never forget when he told me, he said, "You need to go to citizenship education program."  That's when I first heard about SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference].  And I never got a grasp of myself as being somebody until I went to SCLC.
Speaker 1: Now this is back in--this is in 1963 or so, or--
Speaker 2: In 1950 something.
Speaker 1: --fifty--okay.
Speaker 2: It, it was about fifty something, 'cause I had my first child in '57 [1957], teenage mother.  And--
Speaker 1: So you would have been fourteen?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I had first one when I was fourteen and second when I was fifteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Can you imagine that, being a preacher's daughter?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 629851
Speaker 1: Well, I want to go back a little further. Let's go back to your mother's history.  We were trying to talk about your mother's fam--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --family history.  So who (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I didn't know that much.
Speaker 1: --who are your, your grandparents?  Did, did you know your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Never met them?
Speaker 2: Frieda Watkins [ph.] I know is my grandma.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Do you know what she did for a living?
Speaker 2: --she looked like she was white.  You would think she was white.
Speaker 1: Okay, very light, huh?
Speaker 2: Yeah, all that, that, that side of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: What did she do for a living?  I mean what did your grandparents do for a living?  Were they farmers or did they--
Speaker 2: Yeah, farming, yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --'cause they worked on the farm out there.
Speaker 1: Now was there a grandfather?
Speaker 2: I, I, I don't remember him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't remember him.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay, now, did your mother talk about what it was like--now was she, she was very light too, I suppose, right?
Speaker 2: No, she didn't have none--
Speaker 1: Your, your mother wasn't?
Speaker 2: She wasn't light, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So her father must have been darker than her mother.  I mean do you suspect that?
Speaker 2: He prob- probably was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm not real--
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Did she have any stories about growing up?  I mean what, what, what was it like for her growing up?
Speaker 2: My grandma?
Speaker 1: No, your mother.
Speaker 2: My ma?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I don't think Mattie Bigham [Mattie Watkins Bigham] ever really talked about growing up.  It's just some things she didn't talk about.  Color was one of them.  We just--even when we went to school, that kind of--we didn't talk about stuff like that, as if it didn't exist (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But she never said you know, when I was a girl, I did this or did that or--
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  And I remember she did day's work for a white lady. And I remember she had to sit in the back seat of the white lady's car.  And the, the white--it wasn't nothing up front but the white lady and the dog, and mama had to sit in the--and, and that, 'cause that just stayed in my--
Speaker 1: Oh, the, the white lady would come pick her up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, for day's work, yeah.
Speaker 1: And so she would sit in the backseat, and the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and the dog would sit in the front seat?
Speaker 2: Yeah that's the way it was then.  And Ms. Hilburn, Earl Hilburn [Dorothy Parks Hilburn] was her name.  And mama was doing day's work, really raised her children.  She raised her children, that white lady's children.  And, and mama, she would come and pick mama up.  And that stayed in--even 'til today I can see her sitting in the backseat of that car right by herself, and the white lady and the dog would be in the, in the front seat.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so did you, did you--did, did your mother have a chance to go to school?
Speaker 2: I'm, I'm sure she did.  I don't remember them days, but I'm sure she did because she was very--she could write well and speak well, so some of that had to come from somewhere.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So did she grow up in Dudley [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --all the Watkins, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: That's where daddy [J.C. Bigham] met her.
Speaker 1: In Dudley?
Speaker 2: He, he came there to preach.
Speaker 1: Well, so did she work for the same family for, for, for a long--
Speaker 2: Um-hm--
Speaker 1: --long time?
Speaker 2: --yeah, right, worked for that lady I guess fifty-six years.
Speaker 1: Can you remember the lady's name?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Earl Hilburns, Ms. Earl Hilburn.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was her name.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I think she's dead now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And matter of fact, I was on TV one time, and he called, her son called, said, "Is this Imagene Bigham [HistoryMaker Bishop Imagene Stewart]?"  And I said, "Yeah."  He said, "You might remember me."  He say, "My mama was named Mrs. Earl Hilburn."  I said--I think, I think his name was Jimmy [James Hilburn]--I said, "Is this you, Jimmy?"  And went and laughed and stuff, but I remember the day when he would not speak to us.  He would not.  But that's--he, he a, he's a lawyer or something.  He was up here.  I, I thought you.  That's why I tell people, treat folk right.  You don't know when you, you know, you gonna see them in another role.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That's true; that's true.  So, so your mother, now did she--you said she had two children before she met your father?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, okay.
Story_ID: 629852
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Reverend J.C., James Charles Bigham, but they always called him J.C. Bigham, B-I-G-H-A-M.  He was born in, in--I think it's Tennille, Georgia.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: T-E-N-N-I-L-L-E-E [sic.], I think.
Speaker 1: Tennet--I'm sorry.  Is it Tenet [sic.], you said?
Speaker 2: That ain't the right way.  I'm not saying it right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, somewhere---T-E-N-N-I-L-L-E, something like that.
Speaker 1: L-L--
Speaker 2: 'Cause I don't even hear that term or that town now.
Speaker 1: Tennille, Tennille--
Speaker 2: Tennille, Tennille, Georgia.  Yeah, that sounds--
Speaker 1: Tennille, Georgia.
Speaker 2: --more like it, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, Tennille, Georgia.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and do you know what his date of birth was?
Speaker 2: I think him and mama was about the same age.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now, do you know much about his family history?
Speaker 2: As I said, my daddy had five children by his first wife.  And his wife died, and he went to Dublin [sic. Dudley, Georgia], and that's where he met Mattie Watkins [Mattie Watkins Bigham].  He, he, he met Mattie Watkins and--let me see.  He met her, and I'm the product--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --of them two.  And it was--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --that he had--she had two children; he had five children, and I'm the product of both of them.  I'm the--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --only one.
Speaker 1: I think I read or heard on a previous interview that he was, he was like a circuit preacher.
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: So was he--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --was, was Dub- was Dublin part of his--
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: --I mean or was Dudley [Georgia] part of his circuit?
Speaker 2: Yes, that was part of his circuit.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was preaching at the church that your mother attended?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And that's how they met?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, now is there a story about how the met?  I mean some kind of a story about how they--
Speaker 2: He say--he, he told me he couldn't hardly preach for looking at mama.  He told me he could not, 'cause that was a good looking woman.  Do you hear what I say?  That was a good looking woman.  And--but he always saw them two white children, always, and he always wondered where they came.  She never said them was her children.  But, so he asked her would she marry him.  That's the only time he said she brought up the fact that was his [sic.] two daughters, those two little children he had, two girls.
Speaker 1: Okay, now--
Speaker 2: And he said his family talked about him when he carried her to Tennille, Georgia, to me his dau- his children.  And they wanted to know whose children was them. And he said, "Well, this is my new wife.  This is--this is her two daughters."
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is there a story about where the children came from?
Speaker 2: They'd always said their daddy was, was white.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they all--had to be some, some, something happened there, 'cause you don't be that, you know, light, honey.
Speaker 1: Do, do you suspect, or do you think, or did anybody in the family think that they may have been children of the Hilburns, or somebody in that family that she worked for?
Speaker 2: You know, I hadn't, I had never thought about that.  I hadn't, I really never thought about--but it could have been, because mama stayed there in that family sixty something years, 'cause, 'cause she raised, she raised them children.  I, you know, I just never thought about that.  It could have been.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  I just thought I'd raise it.
Speaker 2: Yeah--I just--
Speaker 1: I don't wanna be, you know--
Speaker 2: --had never--'cause they always said they daddy was white.  People always said it, but they never said who.  She never did say.
Speaker 1: Well, ma'am, these are the mysteries in a lot of black families.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: There are sec- similar--
Speaker 2: They never did say.
Speaker 1: --mysteries in, in my own, so we--
Speaker 2: But they had to come from somewhere, 'cause somebody--
Speaker 1: That's, that's right; that's right.
Speaker 2: 'Cause there was a white man some of them said named Son Whitaker [ph.].  And they said mama hung around him.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, so that's another possibility.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was another possibility, 'cause my sister--I never did  (unclear) they probably didn't know where they (unclear) and that's the, the, the, the thing that tore our family apart, 'cause daddy always say you all wouldn't have a name, if it wasn't for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he felt that your mother should have been grateful--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --or the children should have been--
Speaker 2: --that he--
Speaker 1: --grateful that--
Speaker 2: The children should have been--my two sisters should have been grateful that he'd give them a name.  Oh, they would fight about it all--and, and my, that's why really my sister left Dublin, because he would throw that up in her face all the time.  And, "You, and you wouldn't even had a name if it wasn't for me."
Speaker 1: So he used it as a putdown to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.  That's right.
Speaker 1: Now--
Story_ID: 629853
Speaker 1: Now what, what about your father's [J.C. Bigham] history?  Did, did, did he have a chance to go to school, or did he--where did he become a preacher, and do, do you have any idea (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, he went, he went.  See, back in them days, you didn't have to go to seminary and all that.  But Lord, you talking about somebody could sing and preach.  Great god, them women would throw them hats off.  He'd come in the door, he had long--he was black as midnight, couldn't see nothing but the whites of his eyes.  And, and he had long hair.  You would hear him hollering in the back, 'cause back then they called it potash, you know.  Now they call it relaxer.  But he used to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, he put that in his hair.
Speaker 2: He put that and make his hair straight down, and Lord, you could hear him hollering out there.  But let me tell you, when he washed that stuff out of his head, let me tell you, you talking about a good looking man.  He was something to behold.  And he'd walk in the church, them women would throw their hats off, glory shouting.  I'll never forget that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and, and mama, back in them days, the first lady would sit up front.  Daddy had her a, a chair, Mrs. Mattie Bigham [Mattie Watkins Bigham], and have her to come in, escorted in the church.  And back, and back in them days, the, the head of the usher board would escort her up front to her seat.  And come to find out, daddy was going with the head of the, the nurses and left, left town with her.  That's where he died, in Jacksonville, Florida, woman left her (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, he actually left--he actually moved in with her and left, I mean he--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah--
Speaker 1: --left with her.
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and, and that, I think devastating--
Speaker 1: But that's sometime--
Speaker 2: --to me.
Speaker 1: --that's sometime later though, right--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --when he does that.
Speaker 2: I think I was about--yeah, I had had Michael [Michael Johnson] and Jeffrey [Jeffrey Johnson] then.  I was about fifteen.  It was--they were born in fourteen and fifteen, so somewhere about my age.  (Unclear). They, they went back to--it's kind of painful, and I really had some pain in my life.
Speaker 1: So, so I take it from, I, I guess from looking, I saw some of the other interview, and I read, you know, some things.  I take it they didn't have that good a relationship (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh no, no.
Speaker 1: It's a bad, you know--
Speaker 2: No, 'cause they were light skinned.  That, that was the main sticking point, 'cause people would get on my daddy: "Why would you marry that woman with them two white children?"  And I think it finally got to him.  I think it finally got--I think he got over it when I was born, but he never did.  I think he never did get over that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Think that bothered him?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, it did--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --bother him; yes, it did.
Speaker 1: Did you--mean did, did your mother's family think that they were better than him 'cause he was so dark?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause they were light skinned.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And daddy was black as midnight.
Speaker 1: And he was criticized by other black people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: --for getting with her.
Speaker 2: That's right--
Speaker 1: So it's--
Speaker 2: --absolutely, yep.
Story_ID: 629854
Speaker 1: Can you describe their personalities for me, and tell me who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: My daddy [J.C. Bigham].
Speaker 1: Okay, why?
Speaker 2: 'Cause see, my daddy--and I hurt him when I got pregnant.  That, that almost killed him, because he would always put me up on a pedestal in front of the, the two children mama [Mattie Watkins Bigham] had, that I was, you know, better than they was until, until I got pregnant, and it crushed him.  And then that's when he finally left.  He didn't stay.  I blame myself for that.  And--
Speaker 1: So he was so upset he left your mother because you got pregnant?
Speaker 2: I, I really think that that had a lots to do with it.  It had--and being you a pastor of a church, you trying to tell people how to live, and your own child, your own baby, baby having a baby.  That's right, baby having a baby.  And--
Speaker 1: So was that unusual in those days for you--
Speaker 2: Oh, god, yes.
Speaker 1: --for you to be pregnant--
Speaker 2: You didn't have--
Speaker 1: --at fourteen?
Speaker 2: That, that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Honey, you didn't--especially when your daddy was a preacher.  And you could--in them little towns, everything--everybody knew everybody's business.  And daddy, daddy would say, daddy would say, "Imagene [HistoryMaker Bishop Imagene Stewart], you got to go to the church and tell the church to forgive you."  And I think that was my first experience of getting before an audience.  I had to go to the church and I asked the church to forgive me for my sins, and swear, nine months later I had another one.  I said, "Daddy, do I go back to the church?"  He said, "No, you don't go back this time," (laughter).  I never will forget that, "No, you don't go back this time."
Speaker 1: Now was the young man you were dealing with, did you have to marry him, or, or did--what happened?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was--I never will forget.  He was riding a bicycle, on the bicycle, carrying groceries.  And that's why I don't fool with churchmen today.  I'm sorry.  That's what messed my life up.
Speaker 1: He was a church--
Speaker 2: Oh, honey, could sing.  And that's why, honey, any man tell me the go to church somewhere, "It's good meeting you brother."  No, no, no.  I mean, that's what ruined my life.
Speaker 1: But, but doesn't that make things kind of difficult for you now?  Now you're a minister.
Speaker 2: I ain't had nothing to do with that.
Speaker 1: And you're a pastor of a church.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And you don't trust churchmen?
Speaker 2: Oooh, never, never, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: So (laughter).
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, no.  I, I understand; I understand, but I don't fool with no churchmen.
Speaker 1: That's--
Speaker 2: And yeah, and that--can you believe that has stayed with me for fifty, sixty years, that same thing?  But if you tell me you go, "Hey, Imagene, you want to go out to dinner?"  "Well, fine."  And then he tell me, "I'm the associate pastor of what--."  Honey, I'd give him an excuse, "I can't go this time.  I'll call you.  You ain't call me.  I'll call you," unh-uh.
Speaker 1: So do you think it's something about the church culture in the black community or something that, that creates a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I, I think so, because I should have been told about having sex.  But you see, when you are raised up in the church, you didn't discuss sex.  And I still feel like--and I tell my two boys [Michael Johnson and Jeffrey Johnson] right now, who's grown in they forties, "I appreciate you being here, but God knows if I knew what I knew now, you would not be here.  And I, I thank God for you."  But every child ought to be told about sex, especially those who in the church should be.  But they never told me anything about having sex.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it wasn't discussed, but apparently it was practiced, though.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They ought to tell me, especially in a church.  That ought to be a part of your curriculum.  You should tell them about sex.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: That's why we got HIV [human immunodeficiency virus] and stuff is so prevalent out here, because nobody tells these church folk.

Speaker 1: So, well, what about your--I was asking you about their personalities.  Like, like what aspect of you is like your father [J.C. Bigham]?
Speaker 2: 'Cause I followed I think in his footsteps.  I followed in his footsteps.  I think when I went in the ministry, I think it was always in me, if you will, because I loved my daddy so.  And whatever he did--and remember, I'm--back in them days, women could not be in the pulpit, but my daddy put me on his lap and sat me right in the pulpit.  And I think that was my first knowledge of being in a pulpit.  And I all--and I liked it, and that's where I stayed.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We're, we're gonna pause here and change tape.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's where I stayed.
Story_ID: 629856
Speaker 1: I was asking you about--now, what, what kind of personality did your mother [Mattie Watkins Bigham] have?
Speaker 2: Reserved, just like a preacher's wife, knew your place.  And, and I was always the mouth in the family.  And my sisters were very quiet too, just like they mama.  There was nothing quiet about me.  I was just like my daddy [J.C. Bigham].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So you say your daddy was--so he had strict rules he wanted people--you know, he wanted you to--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --or he had a vision for what he wanted you to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that he wanted me to be--
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: Now did he, did he abuse your mother?
Speaker 2: Yes, Lord.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I can see them fighting right now.  I can see him throwing her out the back door.  I can see that right now.
Speaker 1: So it was like a regular thing?
Speaker 2: Yes, preaching on Sunday, fighting on Monday.
Speaker 1: So nothing really--I mean it didn't--when you were growing up you saw this on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --as a kid, you know.
Speaker 2: I think sometimes that's why I got into the whole area of domestic violence, is because I can remember what happened to my mama and my daddy.  And even, even with that, I still loved my daddy more than I did my mama.  I don't know if it's because he was in the ministry or what, but I always loved my daddy.
Speaker 1: Now, he didn't drink or anything, did he?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what, what do you think made him--did he think he--
Speaker 2: He still--I still say it was that color thing.  It was them girls.  I still say that's what made him turn on my mama, because people kept on in and on him because of them two girls.
Speaker 1: Now was it, now was that, his behavior like uncommon in those days?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You didn't have fights like you did back then, with men beating on women, back--I'm sure it was going on, but, but theirs was so public.
Speaker 1: Okay, so actually in public he would--
Speaker 2: Public, oh yes, it was in public, yes, Lord.
Speaker 1: For instance, I mean he wouldn't hit her in church, would he?
Speaker 2: No, he never hit--that I remember.  But I remember my sister, my oldest sister, would try to take up for her, and he would knock her down.  I never will forget that.  But he would--she would fight for her.  That's why she left Dublin [Georgia].

Speaker 2: Yeah, it probably didn't get to--
Speaker 1: And see, and see, back then you had a church every Sunday.  That's why he ran circuit route. There was a church every Sunday.  It wasn't like you had all four Sundays for a church.  He had a church, different church, every Sunday.
Speaker 2: So he would go to Dudley [Georgia] and Dublin and--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --and where?
Speaker 1: Wrightsville [Georgia].
Speaker 2: Wrightsville.
Speaker 1: And where else did he go?  It was another church, Wrightsville, Cochran [Georgia], and a different church every Sunday, except on fifth Sundays.  On fifth Sunday, then we could visit other churches on fifth Sunday.

Speaker 1: Yeah.  The, the, the girls didn't go.  The girls--and only me, mama [Mattie Watkins Bigham], and daddy.  They never did.  I can't ever in my memory remember them going to church with my daddy, never.

Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --baby.  Okay.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  So, well, what, what other sights, and sounds, and smells?
Speaker 2: I used to wash dishes, used to drink a lot of corn liquor.
Speaker 1: You did?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Mean when you were a little kid?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I used to drink a lot of corn liquor.
Speaker 1: Where were you getting corn liquor as a little kid, you know?  I mean when you were--I'm, I'm talking about when you were a child growing up.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You'd drink corn liquor?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Well, where did you get it?
Speaker 2: From the grown folks.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they would--
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause my uncle had a still.  And everybody went out there in Dudley [Georgia].  He had a still, and we all drunk liquor from there when the church--when we left church we went to the still.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, would your father be with you?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he wasn't there, okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: So you, you said your father didn't drink.
Speaker 2: I think he did.  He just didn't drink nothing around me.  I, I think, I, I actually think he drinks, but I never saw him drink.
Speaker 1: I was asking because I know a lot of men, when they get angry and start hitting people, have had too much to drink, you know.  But I just wondered if that was--
Speaker 2: No.  Well, I, I don't know when daddy's drinking.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I really don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Just nasty.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so they would let you drink this corn liquor out in the, the the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, because that was like part of the cotton field.  That was part of the cotton field.  You know, we could have a drink or something out there, young people, teenagers, whatever.  It was just, it was just the culture.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you would do that when you'd go to work or something, or would--
Speaker 2: When we'd get out in the field.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We, we, we generally got in the field about 4:30 or 5:00.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did it work--now I've seen the work where they come by in a truck, and everybody gets in the truck, and they go out to the field and pick, and they come back, you know.  Is that what, is that how it worked?
Speaker 2: Let me see; yeah, we--I'll tell you something I did remember: my mama never had to ride on the back of the truck like the rest of us.  She could always ride up front with the white man for some reason.  I, you know, I never thought about that.  But she never had to ride on the back of the truck like the rest of the women.  She always had a seat up front.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you don't know why, right?
Speaker 2: I don't know why, but I just, I'm, I think I, I--now that I think about it, she never.  And then she never really had to pick, 'cause see, she like was in the house fixing food for the people.  You know what I'm saying?  She never had to do all of that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So she fixed the meals for the people for lunch--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how old were you when you started working like that?
Speaker 2: I started picking cotton I think when I was about seven--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --or eight I started picking cotton.  And I think I was about ten when I started washing dishes--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at the (mumbling) there was called Ma Hawkins Cafe downtown [Dublin, Georgia].  And I started washing dishes.  And them the only jobs I knew anything about--
Speaker 1: Okay.

Story_ID: 629864
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And my sister come running home to mama [Mattie Watkins Bigham]: "Mama, mama--," 'cause see, I thought I was just getting fat, so to speak.  My sister come run--I can see it today--came running to mama: "Mama, mama, they said, they say Imagene [HistoryMaker Bishop Imagene Stewart] pregnant."  And I had to stop going to school [Oconee High School, Dublin, Georgia].  See, back in them days, you couldn't go to school and be pregnant, and I still think that's a good idea.  You could not go to school, but I had to start to night school.  They had an adult school I had to go to.  And I thank God for my mama that she kept me used to going.  'Cause see, a lot of girls that get pregnant they forget about school.  (Background noise) They don't, they don't go back.  And mom--
Speaker 2: Well, did you--okay, go ahead.
Speaker 1: "Mama, mama, Imagene pregnant."  And I didn't even know what being pregnant, know what being pregnant was.  But, honey, I'll tell the--when I talks now to the young people, I say, "Let me tell y'all something: I didn't know I was pregnant.  Nobody--somebody had to tell me what the word pregnant meant."  And I just--and as I say, when daddy [J.C. Bigham]--when the thing came out that I was pregnant, I started going to night school, and had to go before the church, ask the church to forgive me for my sins, and swear, nine months later--but you know what I tell the children, the girls now?  I say, "Honey, I don't know about your hooks and crooks and all these things y'all use now, but let me tell you something; I just think--," 'cause see, back in them days, abortion wasn't a word.  We didn't use the word abortion.  I didn't know what the word abortion was.  And I'll tell my boy now, I said, "You would have been aborted had I know about abortion, but I didn't know nothing about it."  So, you know, that's just the way, you know, that turned out.  But I'm so glad that I had him.  Every time I see him now, I thank God that I had him.  And I told him that he was not aborted.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I'll tell you what: when I had that second one and found out what was causing it, I didn't take no hooks, crooks, nothing else.  The purpose of the thing, when you find out what's causing something, you leave it alone, and that's what I did.  I left sex alone.
Speaker 2: For the rest of your life?
Speaker 1: For--well, now, no, not the rest of that.  But I'm gonna tell you: I, I left it alone and didn't have no more babies.  And mama thought I was on some pills or this, that, and the--um-hm, no more, just through.

Speaker 2: --they just went in different ways.  He went different ways.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, they were--first one was born in '57 [1957], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And the second one in '58 [1958]?
Speaker 2: Fifty-eight [1958].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There you go.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 629867
Speaker 1: This is the time period when people, the whole country started like paying attention to the Civil Right Movement, I mean those who weren't aware of how people were being--or said they weren't aware of how people (laughter) were being treated down south.  But Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] had the Montgomery Bus Boycott in '56 [1956], and you know--
Speaker 2: And then that's when I began to ask the question, why do we have to go in colored bathrooms?  And they had white and colored.  That's when I--and mama [Mattie Watkins Bigham] always said, "Well, don't worry about--," and I, I've always questioned why I had to go in a colored bathroom.  And even I remember Greyhound [The Greyhound Corporation; Greyhound Lines, Inc.], when we'd catch the Greyhound bus, we had to go around to the back to buy a ticket.  And those are the things that made me aware.  But then there was--but, but the thing was, back then, a lot of folks, when you ask the question, who cares?  You know, they really didn't--you act like you asking the wrong questions.  And, and people would say who, who care?  Even the preachers; the preachers did not care.
Speaker 1: They just accepted it.
Speaker 2: They just accepted it and went ahead on.  And, and when I went to jail so many times that--
Speaker 1: Well, let's not get you in jail first.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I want, want to lead--we want to lead up to it.  But that--so did you know anybody when you were kid that actually defied those rules?  Did anybody push back against them?
Speaker 2: Ms. Ruth, Ruth--think her name was Ruth Harvey [Ruth W. Harvey].  She was the president of the local branch of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  That's when I started working with her.
Speaker 1: Now did you start working with her when you were in--now you, you had to drop out of high school [Oconee High School, Dublin, Georgia], right?  And you were going--
Speaker 2: And go to night school.
Speaker 1: --and going to night school.  Did--were you able to finish night school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How, how long did it take you?  It take you a long time, or--
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  I got it the same time I would have if I had stayed in day school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you were eighteen you'd finished night school.
Speaker 2: I think I finished school at sixteen.
Speaker 1: Okay, so just about two years?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Going to night school, you got all the necessary credits that you needed?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so when did you start to meet--working with Ms. Harvey?
Speaker 2: I think, I think my whole world really started when Michael [Michael Johnson] was born.  I think my world, civil rights world started at fourteen.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: That's when.
Speaker 1: I mean why do you say that?
Speaker 2: Because that just seemed like when I got aware.  Like to me, I didn't exist before fourteen, really.
Speaker 1: So, his birth just kind of shocked you to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: I know everything changed 'cause your--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --father [J.C. Bigham] got very angry, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was, was, was your mother angry too?
Speaker 2: No.  She never, she never--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I told you, she was the one that got me in night school.  Daddy didn't care whether I went to school or not.  But I was real smart.  My ma always said I was real smart.  And so that's when she checked around, see was there anywhere I could go to school.  But I still say that, that girls that get pregnant should not go to school with the regular children.  I still say that after all these years.
Speaker 1: Why, why do you feel that way?
Speaker 2: Because it's a bad influence.  It's a--you, you, you toting around a baby with the rest of the children in school.  No, that shouldn't happen.
Story_ID: 629868
Speaker 1: Now how did you say--where did you meet Ms. Harvey [Ruth W. Harvey]?  Or did somebody from the group recruit you, or how did you get involved in the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]?
Speaker 2: My sisters, who were bougie, went to the First Baptist Church [First African Baptist Church, Dublin, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Your sisters were bougie?
Speaker 2: Oh yes (unclear).
Speaker 1: Now, well, explain this.  Now how could your sisters be bougie and you not be bougie?
Speaker 2: 'Cause I've been a people, a regular, down to earth person.  My mama [Mattie Watkins Bigham] always told me, 'cause you, you hang with low class people.  She has always told me.  It ain't changed.  She, before she died she said you're still hanging with low class people.  But it's just something--but my sisters always went to the best, hung with the best.  And when, when I began to ask questions about the white and colored signs, Doretha [ph.] said, "Well, there's a lady named Ms. Harvey as the head of the N- ,"--now she wasn't going--"the NAACP."
Speaker 1: Your sister?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: She wasn't, but she knew who to tell me to go.  Neither, neither one of my sisters, they was never involved.
Speaker 1: But, well, how did you get into--interested in the NAACP in the first place?
Speaker 2: I said white and colored signs, Belk Matthews [Belk Matthews Company].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  So you knew the NAACP was involved in--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --civil rights.
Speaker 2: --and I wasn't--yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, but it was too slow for me.  God knows they--and I could tell by Ms. Harvey, that she was just bougie.  It was just too slow for me.  And there was a man named Julius [Julius Gambel (ph.)] something.  He was working in, he was in the VA [Veterans Administration; U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs].  He was a, a VA man.  Gambel, Gambel I think was his name.  And, and, but I was never comfortable with my sisters' friends.  I was never comfortable with their world.
Speaker 1: Now she--now, would you consider your mother bougie--
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: --in that sense?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, your sisters, what did they--
Speaker 2: Well, my sisters were.
Speaker 1: Did, did they marry bougie people, or was it--well, how did they get bougie?
Speaker 2: I think so.  See, my sister went to Knoxville College [Knoxville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I, I told her, even now, I told her that's why she went to Knoxville College, 'cause they had bougie people.  And, but my sister, oldest sister, who is dead now, they hung around light skinned people.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is a skin color thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: And a--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, okay.  So if you're light, you got an entree into black bougie--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --class.
Speaker 2: And you got a, you, you got a way in.  But my sis- my--and mama would tell me I hung with low class people because Doretha, her oldest child, would say I hung with low class people.  And, and that, that still goes around now.  That still--that, that label is on me now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Here in Washington, D.C., they say, "Imagene [HistoryMaker Bishop Imagene Stewart], you just hang with them old low class people."  How can you say that?  You black, they black.  But unh-uh, honey, I don't hang with them low class people.  So that's how I wind up.
Story_ID: 629869
Speaker 1: So you, so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I--and, and that's, that's I got from S- from, from NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] to SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I wasn't happy--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --with the NAACP bunch.
Speaker 1: Now but you said you were the youth director--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh--
Speaker 1: --for the NAACP.
Speaker 2: --in the NAACP, yeah.
Speaker 1: So how, about, about how--I mean so your job was to organize the--
Speaker 2: Recruit.
Speaker 1: --youth and to recruit and organize the youth?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But when they found out--word got out that I had a baby out of wedlock, it was just a difference when they said--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --oh, you got a baby?  And so, but when I started, Mr. James Holder, I never will forget, James Holder started the SCLC chapter in Dublin [Georgia], and I switched from the NAACP to SCLC.  And that's where I stayed 'til this day.
Speaker 1: Well, the, the SCLC was new in those days, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, it was--
Speaker 1: It just--
Speaker 2: --brand new, just starting.
Speaker 1: It formed, what, in fifty--
Speaker 2: Fifty-seven [1957].
Speaker 1: --seven [1957], right.
Speaker 2: Fifty-seven [1957], yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it took off like wildfire, because people felt more comfortable.  People felt more comfortable in the SCLC than they did the NAACP.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So was James Holder a reverend?
Speaker 2: It's still--no.  He still--
Speaker 1: He wasn't a reverend?
Speaker 2: --he's still--and he must have been the president fifty years now.  He's still is the president.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause when my mama [Mattie Watkins Bigham] died, he came to the funeral.  I said, "Is that you, James Holder?"  And I--'cause I hadn't been in Dublin in years.  And 'cause I told you I left there in '63 [1963], and I don't think I ever went back but one time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, okay, so you joined the, the SCLC.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now about what year is this when you joined SCLC?
Speaker 2: See, I came up here in '63 [1963].  Oh, in fifty--when Michael [Michael Johnson] was just being born.  Okay, he was born in '57 [1957], yeah.  Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] had just started SCLC, and James Holder was one of the first leaders locally, locally.  And--
Speaker 1: Okay, so you had been in the NAACP prior to your ba--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --your ba- your baby being born.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah.
Speaker 1: And then when your baby came--
Speaker 2: Yeah, then that's--
Speaker 1: --they--
Speaker 2: --when they--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --they turned against me.
Speaker 1: They turned against you.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you got into SCLC, all right.  Now, you mentioned earlier before we started the interview that you, you wrote a letter to Dr. King or--at--
Speaker 2: Yes, I wrote a letter.
Speaker 1: Now when did this happen?  This happened about this time?
Speaker 2: Un-huh, it was in the '50s [1950s], '57 [1957], or '58 [1958], something.
Speaker 1: This was after you were in, in SCLC or before?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I think this was--
Speaker 1: Okay, you were already in it.
Speaker 2: I was already in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I wrote him a letter about the white and colored signs.  And, and he wrote me back, "Well, you've got to be trained."  So he say, "It costs to go."  SCLC was in McIntosh, Georgia [McIntosh County, Georgia], the school had a citizens--
Speaker 1: The training school--
Speaker 2: --citizenship training [Citizenship Education Program]--
Speaker 1: --was at McIntosh, okay.
Speaker 2: --in McIntosh, Georgia.  I never will forget, McIntosh, Georgia.  And so that's where I went to be trained--
Story_ID: 629870
Speaker 1: --And that's where [at the Citizenship Education Program] I learned about, "I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America."  And my sister said that's what messed me up (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: --pledging allegiance to the flag; you took it too far (laughter).
Speaker 2: Now for those who can't see it, you're, you're actually sitting here now hold the flag.
Speaker 1: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: --absolutely.
Speaker 2: That's a--
Speaker 1: I, I tell people I am proud to be in America.
Speaker 2: Raise it up a little bit so we can see it.  We can see it.
Speaker 1: I am proud to be--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --an American.  And our people often tell me, say, "Imagene [HistoryMaker Bishop Imagene Stewart], you wonderful, but you just got your priorities mixed up.  You should be proud that you are, is from Africa.  That's what you need to be proud of."  My answer is, "I thank God for Africa; I've never been to Africa.  I was born in the United States of America and proud of it.  So all y'all that don't, don't like it, I'll help raise the money for you to go home.  But I, I'm home."
Speaker 2: Okay, so, prior to this time though, I mean had you thought much about being an American, or what--
Speaker 1: No.  I learned this from SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's what my sister said what messed me up, that I went to SCLC.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So what aspect of American that--were, were you the most proud of when you were introduced to the idea?
Speaker 1: Well, I think being proud of where you were born, that it's the whole concept of people who try to make me hate my own country.  I don't--you know, if, if you hate where you were born, then you go where you think you should have been born.  I am happy where I am.
Speaker 2: Okay, but was there any particular aspect of it that, that--I mean just the idea of them saying you were, you're an American, or was it something attached to it, or some ideas, or beliefs, or--
Speaker 1: Well, I--
Speaker 2: --attached to it?
Speaker 1: --I think one of the things, we don't appreciate this country.  Sure, oh yes, this country has problems; yes, it has problems.  But I, I tell people all the time thank God, 'cause I remember my, I, talking to Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture].  He said, "Imagene, the only difference between me and you, they dropped me off first before they got y'all on."  But I said, "Well, I--"
Speaker 2: Because he was from the Caribbean.
Speaker 1: That's right.  He said, "They dropped us off first before they carried y'all on."  But I still say, I still say that you ought to be proud.  And then they try to make a, a issue out of, at least with me--I just think we got to learn to appreciate who you're from, where you was born at.  I, I, that's why I like that song that this guy sings from New Jersey, 'Born in America' [sic.].
Speaker 2: Oh, 'Born in the U.S.A.'
Speaker 1: 'Born in the U.S.A.,' that.
Speaker 2: That's Bruce Springsteen.
Speaker 1: Bruce Springsteen.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I just think we have to learn to appreciate.  If that makes me a Tom [Uncle Tom], so be it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you do you think it makes you a Tom?  I guess you don't think it does.
Speaker 1: Of course not.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But there are some people that, that think--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.  Honey--
Speaker 2: --that that's true.
Speaker 1: --they call me Aunt Jemima, a Tom, and what else they--Tommie Mae [ph.] (laughter); some, some of them call me Tommie Mae.
Speaker 2: I never heard that one.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It's okay.  But I can live with it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, so, it was the, the SCLC training that woke you up to the idea that you were an American and, and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right, because, Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]--we had to pledge allegiance to the flag.
Story_ID: 629871
Speaker 1: But and my sister said that that is what messed me up.
Speaker 2: So the, the--now what's their opinion?  I mean what, what, what do they consider themselves, or how, how do they--
Speaker 1: My sisters?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They didn't know.  They, they just into the, into what they say, into the, I call it the black lung disease.  But they just, just--I don't know if they're anti-white, but maybe they're just pro-black.  When I, when I wore--when I won--'cause I, I'm the first black woman that ever been elected the national chaplain of half a million white women, the American Legion Auxiliary, honey, I was so proud when I won that election.  You--but when I came back to Washington [D.C.] told it, you would have thought--my god, people said, "You what?"  And I was so proud.  But, honey, they give me a fit in this town.
Speaker 2: Now do you think--now this is just, you know, asking for your opinion here.  But do you think that most black people in Washington say, since, since you live here, consider themselves--are, are more proud of being black or being American?  What do you think?
Speaker 1: Being pr- they are more proud of being black.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I have no problems.  I don't need an adjective.  I'll put it like that.  I don't need an adjective in front of American, to say I'm a black American or African American, or colored American.  I don't need a adjective.  It's fine with me to say I am an American.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So the SCLC's [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] training [Citizenship Education Program] was to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's right.
Speaker 2: --instill the fact that you are an American, and as such you are entitled to--?
Speaker 1: All the rights and privileges.  That's why I started the shelter [House of Imagene Shelter and Women's Center, Washington, D.C.], is to, to try to instill in my people the, that, that some of us do care about your wellbeing.  You don't have to be bougie.  We do care about you.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And there are some white people.  Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] never would have got where he got if it had not been for white people, but we don't put that part on there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 629872
Speaker 1: Now, let's go back.  Now you, you go to citizensip--ship training [Citizenship Education Program] in McIntosh, Georgia [McIntosh County, Georgia].
Speaker 2: McIntosh, Georgia.
Speaker 1: And who, who, who are your teachers there?
Speaker 2: Lord, I don't remember them pe- oh yeah, Septima Clark [Septima Poinsette Clark].  She's dead now I think.
Speaker 1: Septima Clark, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Septima.
Speaker 1: Right, yeah, she's dead.
Speaker 2: And the--what's that other teacher's name?  Dorothy Cotton.  I think she teaches in New Jersey somewhere, Dr. Dorothy Cotton.  She's still living.  She's teaching--or S-E-P-T-I-M-A, I think, Septima Clark.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It was like September.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Septima, S-E-P-T-I-M-A.
Speaker 2: M-A, uh-huh, Septima--
Speaker 1: --Clark--
Speaker 2: --Clark.  She, her--
Speaker 1: --and Dr. Dorothy Cotton.
Speaker 2: --and Dorothy Cotton--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --was my teachers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, well, they're, they're fairly well known figures of the Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So they were your teachers.  And--
Speaker 2: They were my teachers--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when I was there.
Speaker 1: And how long was the course?  How long did, did you study with them?
Speaker 2: I think we were there six weeks I believe.  I, I think we were there six weeks.  But that's something they instilled in us, about pledging allegiance to the flag.  And you don't, you don't hear that now, citizenship.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so you think that, that for the most part that people, black people in the South were--did not know about their, their rights, did not know what rights they were supposed to have (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Or didn't care, or maybe didn't care.
Speaker 1: Or did--okay.
Story_ID: 629873
Speaker 1: See, where I was raised up, the Republican Party was just like the--well it--in the beginning I was a Democrat.
Speaker 2: Were you?
Speaker 1: In the beginning, yeah.
Speaker 2: And when you--I mean was your father [J.C. Bigham] a Democrat?
Speaker 1: I, I would think he was a Republican.  He just never talked about politics.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He never did.
Speaker 2: Your, was your mother [Mattie Watkins Bigham] a Democrat?
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh god, yes (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes, Lord.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, but down there, Democrats were like Republicans up here.  Democrats acted like Republicans, if you will, down there.
Speaker 2: Okay, meaning that they were--
Speaker 1: Civic minded, loved their own country.
Speaker 2: 'Cause like most of the politicians in those days would have been Democrats in the South.
Speaker 1: Well, like the King family.  They were Republicans.
Speaker 2: But most of the--
Speaker 1: They probably may not own it now.  But I remember way back then Daddy King [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.], all of them, they were Republican and were proud of it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, most black people were Republicans in the South, where white, whites were Democrats, in those days anyway.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I remember--so when, when I took the picture you'll see out there with Nancy Reagan, and she said, "Oh, it's so nice to see a Reagan Democrat."  I said, "I beg your pardon, baby.  I am a--." She just figured 'cause I was black, I had to be a, you know, a Democrat.  I said, "I beg your pardon.  I am a Repub- ."  She said, "Oh, you're a Reagan Republican?"  I said, "Yes, ma'am, not a Reagan Democrat.  I'm Reagan Republican."
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now you said that Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was a Republican?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Now did, did you ever hear him say that, or did you--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: How you think I got into all this stuff?
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, I don't, you know--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I'm, I'm asking 'cause I never--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know, you don't--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you don't read about his--
Speaker 1: I don't care what--honey--
Speaker 2: --political affiliation that much.
Speaker 1: --honey, people talk, but I--he always--and anybody who went to citizenship education school [Citizenship Education Program] will tell you that Martin Luther King and his family were Republicans.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Thank God.
Speaker 2: So in those days, Eisenhower, Dwight Eisenhower was president, in '57 [1957].
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: A man, black man--
Speaker 2: A, a Republican.
Speaker 1: --by the name--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --black man by the name of Hobson R. Reynolds, who I had to force him to meet.  He was the one who second the motion, although he looked like he was white, but he was a black man, Hobson R. Reynolds, second the motion.
Speaker 2: Second the nomination of--
Speaker 1: Second the nomination for, for Dwight D. Eisenhower [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower].
Speaker 2: --of Eisenhower?  Okay.
Speaker 1: Yes, he did.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I remember (laughter)--where, where was I?  I went took a picture with Baby Bush [President George Walker Bush].  You--there I had to leave this town, and somebody published it somewhere.  And you--I thought I was gonna have to leave Washington [D.C.] 'cause it came out, I mean, people please.  And I didn't change.  They got mad with me.  They wanted me to turn on Baby Bush.  They didn't like what he was doing.  The [U.S.] Congress, this, that, and--never.  If I'm with you, I'm with you, simple as that.
Speaker 2: Okay, well, we'll get to that later.
Story_ID: 629874
Speaker 1: But we're trying to get you established as starting the, in the movement.  So, so you went to citizenship training [Citizenship Education Program]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and then, then you back to Dub- Dublin [Georgia], I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause McIntosh [McIntosh County, Georgia]--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --was not far from Dublin.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And so, so what did you do when you got back?  What was the agenda of SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference]?
Speaker 2: Oh, I started, start having--there were some sisters there, Bates sisters.  They were black.  They looked like they were white, Sister Bates and her sister, Jessie Bates [ph.].  And we started, started talk--the civil rights demonstrations, and that's when them signs came down.
Speaker 1: So what did you, what, what, what did you do first?  What was your first demonstration?
Speaker 2: Belk Matthews [Belk Matthews Company], that same white and colored place.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's the first place I went.
Speaker 1: Belk Matthews, is that, is that the local--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --department store?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, Belk Matthews.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, sir.
Speaker 1: So what did you demand that they do?  Did you have--
Speaker 2: Take the signs down.
Speaker 1: Take the--
Speaker 2: Take them white--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and colored signs down.  You don't need--y'all people ought to be able to go in any bathroom they wanna go in.
Speaker 1: So what did you do?  Did you all march out in front or--
Speaker 2: Yes.  We started with the signs.
Speaker 1: Okay, a picket?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we started a picket.  Yeah, that is what they called it back then (laughter).  I done forgot about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I ain't been to a picket in years.
Speaker 1: Now this is in 1958, or--I guess now, or is it still--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Somewhere along there, yeah.
Speaker 1: And now, a lot of these places didn't fall so easy.  I mean did, I mean was it easy to do this?
Speaker 2: No.  We had to--let me see what we had.  I think we picketed about a week, and every day I went out there the police picked me up.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so the police would arrest the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was just--
Speaker 1: --the picketers?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you, did you ever--
Speaker 2: And do you know who had to get me out of jail?  Ms. Earl Hilburn [Dorothy Parks Hilburn].  And she, she was--and then, and then mama [Mattie Watkins Bigham], mama would tell Ms. Hilburn to get me out of jail.  "She, she got with that wrong crowd, and she didn't know what she was doing."  Oh people, please.
Speaker 1: So was Ms. Hilburn, did she, did she express any, any opinions about civil rights herself?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  All she did was get me out of jail.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: That's all.  Talking--his name was Big Rock Bussell [W.R. "Rock" Bussell].  That was the name of the sheriff at that time.
Speaker 1: Big Rock--
Speaker 2: Bussell.
Speaker 1: --Bussell.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: B-U-S-T--
Speaker 2: U-S-S-E-L-L--
Speaker 1: --L-E?
Speaker 2: --something like that.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Big Rock Bussell.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, I went to jail so many times.
Speaker 1: So, but she--how many times did she get you out?
Speaker 2: I think about six times, seven times.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, she--
Speaker 2: But, but after then, they finally took the signs down.  I still believe she had something to do with it.
Speaker 1: Ms. Hilburn?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  I still believe it.
Speaker 1: That's why I asked you what she had to say about it--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --'cause I don't think she would have--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --got you out six times had she not believed in what you--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --were doing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I think--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And mama never did say she did, but I still believe that she had something to do with the manager of Belk Matthews taking them white and colored signs down.
Speaker 1: So did that offend the white people very much in--
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, no.
Speaker 1: --Dublin [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: They didn't care?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, they didn't care; they didn't care.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they, they didn't--nobody--or did, did people harass you when you were doing, when you were picketing?
Speaker 2: Black folk, yeah.
Speaker 1: Black people did?
Speaker 2: What you talking about?  They got the jobs.  I'm the one sweating out there from picketing and marching, but do you know who got the jobs?  The, the black folks that were looking out the windows, peeping.  And I won't ever forget that, and I tell them that every time I go to Dublin.  I say, "Y'all working all right?  You know, you know who you need to thank.  That's right, never forget that."
Speaker 1: So they wouldn't help, but they--
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: --they benefited.
Speaker 2: But then, but then when the, when the white folks opened up the jobs--come when--they had, they had--I never will forget Belk Matthews had a--I can't think of the word I want to use now about job creation, when they opened that up.  And they, and they especially said they wanted the colored people to come and fill out there.  Are you kidding?  You ain't done nothing.  Oh, people, I lost my mind.
Speaker 1: How long did it take for Belk Matthews to change?
Speaker 2: I think about six months, 'cause it's--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --because when the TV picked it up.
Speaker 1: So Belk Matthews changed by--this is in the '50s [1950s] still?
Speaker 2: They--this is early '50s [1950s].  Yeah, I think it's about '57 [1957], '58 [1958], '59 [1959], somewhere--
Speaker 1: Well, that'd be about fifty--
Speaker 2: --in there.
Speaker 1: If we go along with the chronology, it would be about '59 [1959] I guess, right?
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Fifty-eight [1958] or '59 [1959].
Speaker 2: --they had the, the thing--but when the media picked it up that they was demonstrating in Dublin, Georgia, 'cause Macon TV came from Macon [Georgia] down there, and we was marching.  Honey, let me tell you, that's what made them change.
Story_ID: 629875
Speaker 1: Now was, when you were picketing in Dublin [Georgia], was it your opinion that most Georgia, most of Georgia was segregated like that?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, that was--yeah, most of them like that.
Speaker 1: Well, was there any, was, was there any city in Georgia that you knew of where there were, there were not black and white signs in?
Speaker 2: Well, I think I heard where, where, where Sandersville, Georgia, where what you call him came from.
Speaker 1: Elijah Muhammad?
Speaker 2: Elijah Muhammad.  Sandersville was race--oh, it was terrible in Sandersville, yeah.  But I think as a result of that, really opened eyes.
Speaker 1: Now did you know anything then about Forsyth County, Georgia--
Speaker 2: No, no, never heard--
Speaker 1: --where, the all-white county that they chased the black people out--
Speaker 2: --of Forsyth.
Speaker 1: --of town?
Speaker 2: I've never heard of Forsyth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I've heard of, you know, I mean of, but I never--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --knew anything--
Speaker 1: You didn't know anybody from there, or--
Speaker 2: No, not from Forsyth, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Forsyth County, Georgia, they, yeah, they chased the black population out of there in 1919 [sic. 1912].  They chased all the blacks out of town and then confiscated their property.
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's the first I ever heard of that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, it's, it's, there's a documentary ['Banished'] about it now that's out that they talk--where it's discussed.  But yeah, they were, they were on 'The Oprah Winfrey Show' twenty years ago talking about it (laughter).
Story_ID: 629876
Speaker 1: But at any rate--so, so you--so this is a big success then--
Speaker 2: Oh yes, it was.
Speaker 1: --for you all to achieve that kind of success in nine--in the '50s [1950s]--
Speaker 2: Yep
Speaker 1: --'cause it, it took like over a year for--
Speaker 2: But it made me an outcast.
Speaker 1: Well, it took over a year--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --for Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] to crack Montgomery [Alabama].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, and you all did it in six months at, at--
Speaker 2: I think it was all right.  It wasn't that long.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Once the media.  Them, the stores did not want their businesses, they was anti anything.  But I, I can't think of that manager's name now from Belk Matthews [Belk Matthews Company].
Speaker 1: Now did some of the N- did, did, did the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] help you at any point?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All I remember was SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference].
Speaker 1: So it wasn't a, a working relationship between the two organizations then?
Speaker 2: Still ain't.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so what, what, what happened after that?  Now you had another baby, right?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: And, and so by this time you've got two babies, and you're working with SCLC.
Speaker 2: I'm working, and I got a job at the VA [Veterans Administration; U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs] washing dishes.  And, and, and when I heard that Dr. King was gonna have the March on Washington is when I got on the bus.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did they have a local bus leaving from--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, so, so it was organized by--
Speaker 2: SCLC.
Speaker 1: Yeah, by James Holder.
Speaker 2: James Holder.
Speaker 1: Yeah, James Holder, okay.
Speaker 2: And honey, I got on that bus and they still looking for me to come back.
Story_ID: 629877
Speaker 1: So now, March on Washington, 1963.  You went on a bus with, what was it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Georgia people.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Georgia people.  And were they, they from other different towns around Georgia too?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They from all over the--mostly from Laurens County [Georgia], (Unclear) County.  We picked a few little stragglers up.  Most of those folks was from right here in D.C. [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Oh, the people at the, at the march?
Speaker 2: At the march was--
Speaker 1: At the march.
Speaker 2: --was from right here.  You don't hear that part, but they from right here.  They was out there when we got here on the bus.  They was out there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so what was it like?  You, you came up here and there were--now this is the biggest civil rights march, you know, up until the Million Man March, is the biggest one of all time I guess.  So did you expect this many people?
Speaker 2: No, I, I, I really didn't.  But you're talking about a good feeling, when you found out that there were other people who felt the way that you did, who were caring American flags, and just, just people of like minds who were not the way you have it today, just anti, anti-America, just anti-America period.
Speaker 1: So you think today most people, most black people are anti-American?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And do you--
Speaker 2: And then they make you, if you love this country, they make you an outcast, because they--you loved where you were born at.  And see, that's where the, the problems come for me.  They can't--they say, "How in the world can you be a civil rights leader and love America?  No such thing."  Oh yes, it is.
Speaker 1: So they actually have told you this?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Pe- people say this to you?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  Oh yes, preachers.  That's all right.
Speaker 1: Okay, but any rate, back to the day though.  Had you ever been to Washington before?
Speaker 2: Never.
Speaker 1: So let, let, let me get some logistics straight.  Now, now you all, did you leave at night and, and drive, and drive all night to D.C.?  Is that how you did it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the bus, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so you left the day be--that night or the day before, or?
Speaker 2: Something.  I don't, I don't--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --have, even remember.
Speaker 1: So you arrived early in the morning, you said, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause they was out there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you didn't stay at a hotel or anything like that.  You just came straight--
Speaker 2: Nobody but the big preachers--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --stayed in the hotels, limousines.  Never will forget that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't even know black folk rode in limousines 'til I came to the Washington March on Washington.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so you had never been--did, did you go around and see the monuments and things?  Did you, did you do that when you were here?
Speaker 2: No, just ate them good pork chops and, and had some good food too.  But it's just there were different people singing.  I remember Fannie Lou Hamer singing.  I like--I used to love to sing with her.  I used to love it.  But it was just a good feeling of camaraderie.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what was your favorite speech at the march?  I mean, you know, were there are any other speeches there besides Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] I Have a Dream speech that, that really moved you?
Speaker 2: Charlton Heston.  I wish someday they'd find that speech where he was talking.  Maybe, so maybe his family, when they go through his things, they'll find that speech.  It was very good.  Let's see, Robert Culp, and what his name is?  'I Spy.'
Speaker 1: Bill Cosby?
Speaker 2: Bill Cosby.  Long as that--can you believe I can't even think of Bill Cosby?  I know I'm getting old.
Speaker 1: He made a speech at the march?
Speaker 2: No.  I'm talking about they were different people out talking.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, so he was out--
Speaker 2: See, they was--
Speaker 1: --in the crowd?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They was, they was like--
Speaker 1: 'Cause--
Speaker 2: --the Oprah Winfrey kind of thing, you know, going around--
Speaker 1: So row--
Speaker 2: --talk--
Speaker 1: --Robert Culp, did he speak actually on the podium?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, okay.
Speaker 2: But they--
Speaker 1: He was--
Speaker 2: --went; they was just talking.
Speaker 1: Robert--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Culp was Bill Cosby's partner in I, 'I Spy,' the TV series.
Speaker 2: 'I Spy,' yeah.
Speaker 1: He's a white guy.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And let me see; them the only ones I remember.  Yeah, I think them I remember.
Story_ID: 629878
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I remember--'cause the bus left me.  I, really I didn't want to come back, tell you truth.  And--
Speaker 1: Now had you ever been out of Georgia before?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I remember getting a job.  That next day I went looking for work.
Speaker 1: Where, where did you live?  I mean, I mean were you just came--you came on the bus, and you didn't plan to stay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So what did you--I mean--
Speaker 2: Well, I slept in the park, in Lincoln Park [Washington, D.C.].  That was before they put Mary McLeod Bethune's statue there.  I slept in the park.  And I said--
Speaker 1: So did you just tell the bus to go back without you, or--
Speaker 2: They didn't--they must've didn't care.  They didn't come looking for me (laughter).  So, so I just stayed.
Speaker 1: Where did you--what did you end up doing when you got away from the rest of the group and they didn't ask about you?
Speaker 2: I guess I had to have something to eat.  And, and I've always had rapport with church folk, go to the church, you know, different churches and stuff like that until I started looking for some, some--I started by the Watergate [Watergate Complex; Watergate Hotel, Washington, D.C.] looking for a dish when man say--I never will forget it--at, at Howard Johnson's.  He said--it was during, it was during lunch hour.  And I say, "Do y'all have any job openings?"  And, and they were busy, and he was short of help.  And he say, "You know how to wash dishes?"  Well, I said to myself any stupid fool know if you from Dublin, Georgia; that's all you could do was wash dishes.  So I, I started right there to washing dishes.  And I've always been an organizer, and I went back there in the kitchen.  They was just doing it all wrong.  They were doing--and my first time back there, I said, "Now wait a minute, y'all.  Y'all got to be better than this."  And they're my people I'm talking to back there in the kitchen.  And I said, "Let's rearrange the kitchen."  "Lady, what in the heck, where you come from you gonna tell me to rearrange it, and you just come here?"  I rearranged the kitchen in Howard Johnson's.  And then the white man didn't know what was wrong with me.  I said, "Just give me a minute."  I rearranged that kitchen, and I think I stayed, I stayed in the kitchen a day.  He asked me, he said, "You know how to, you know how to wa- you know how to be a waitress?"  And back in them days, they had no black waitresses.  He said, "You think you can be a waitress?"  I said, "Give me a chance."  Honey, man at the, the, the man--remember, I'm sleeping the park now.  I'm sleeping in Lincoln Park.  And the man say--so I had put on my uniform.  They gave me a green and white uniform.  I never will forget.  And then he say, he said, "Well, you take this little area over here."
Story_ID: 629879
Speaker 1: So a man come through the door, and I said--and one of the, the gifts that the Lord blessed me with is my ability to be very southern when I want to be.  And a man come through the door with this big entourage.  And looked him.  I said, "Ain't I seen you on the TV?"  And he--now hell, he didn't give a damn about me.  He--the people who was with him, yes, yes, yes.  I said, "You all can sit right over here."  And the, and the other, the girl, white girls I was working with and they said, "Let her go ahead."  The girl, they didn't care about waiting on the--and so I took their orders.  I said, "I know who you is."  He said, "Who?"  I said, "I seen you on the TV.  You Hubert Humphrey."  And oh, honey, you talking about a smile come on his face, my god.  And I think another week I stayed in that kitchen.  They got a call at the Howard Johnson's, and the man say, "Imagene [HistoryMaker Bishop Imagene Stewart], I hate to lose you."  I said oh, Lord, is I done overstepped my boundary?  He said, "I hate to lose--," said, "a man, Walter Washington, Mayor Walter Washington, want you to come down to his office, say he had a job for you."  And all the, the girls what was around me: "How in the world did you pull that off?"  Which I really didn't pull nothing off.  I really wasn't, wasn't no--so I, I--and he, Mayor Washington--and then one of the girls told me, she say, you know--and she said, "Aren't from Georgia?"  I said, "Yeah."  She said, "Do you know he from Georgia?"  I said, "You kidding, honey."
Speaker 2: Who, who is that?
Speaker 1: Mayor Washington.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: Walter Wa- I said--and she said, "Yeah, he from Dawson, Georgia."  So I saw him out there by the water fountain in the District Building [John A. Wilson Building, Washington, D.C.].  And I said, I said, "Mr. Mayor?"  And you know what security do.  You know how they shield you from--'cause they didn't know nothing about me.  And I said, "I heard you from Georgia."  He said, "Yes."  I said, "I'm from Georgia.  I'm from Dublin, Georgia."  He said, "Come on in."  And right then is when things started for Imagene in this town.
Speaker 2: Okay, so the cau- now, you met Hubert Humphrey first, right?
Speaker 1: Un-huh, that's right--
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: --Hubert Humphrey.
Speaker 2: --are you saying in the--that Hubert Humphrey hooked you up with the job, or did you--
Speaker 1: Yes, Hubert Humphrey was the one that called--
Speaker 2: Washington.
Speaker 1: --Mayor Washington's--
Speaker 2: Walt- Walter Washington.
Speaker 1: --office.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.  And that's how I got started.
Story_ID: 629880
Speaker 1: So what did they hire you to do?
Speaker 2: Sent me to college, sent me to Washington Tech [Washington Technical Institute; University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.].  And I worked in Mayor Washington's [Walter Washington] office, in the EEO office [equal employment opportunity] two days a week, and I went up to Washington Tech three days a week.  Remember, I'm still sleeping in the park [Lincoln Park, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: So you still don't have a place--
Speaker 2: Still don't have a place to stay.  I'm still sleeping in the park.  And then a guy I met when I was getting ready to go back to the park, and he say--was a girl named Carol Randolph [HistoryMaker Carol Randolph-Jasmine].  They had a TV show in D.C. [Washington, D.C.] called 'Harambee.'  And she say, she said, "They tell me you got Mayor Washington (unclear)," said, "they tell you got an interesting story.  You want to come on TV and talk about it?"  And I, so I went on Channel 9 [WDVM-TV; WUSA-TV, Washington, D.C.] on 'Harambee' and talked about my plight and how I wanted to start a, a home.  Honey, I went on Carol Randolph's show and talked about how I wanted to start a shelter, and that's when it started from there (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now this is the same year that you arrived.  This is in '63 [1963] still?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and they was in--wait a minute.  It must have been--see, it was--well, see, I started working at the, at the kitchen [at Howard Johnson's] in '63 [1963].  I started working in the kitchen, and I think I stayed there I don't think, a year.  I think I might have--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --stayed there--
Speaker 1: So that's '64 [1964].
Speaker 2: Yeah, because I was still in the, still sleeping in the park.  And a guy named Clarence Fisher [ph.]--I got a room, got a room and yeah, got a room.
Speaker 1: So Howard Johnson's was '64 [1964].  So did, did you meet Humphrey [Hubert Humphrey] in '64 [1964] too?  Is that right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Humphrey was the first person I met.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is '64 [1964].
Speaker 2: He was the one that steered me to Mayor Washington.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I went to Channel 9.
Speaker 1: So how long had you been working for Harold--for Mayor Washington before you, you got the call from Channel 9?
Speaker 2: I think I had been working about three years.  I think that I, I had--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --down in the--
Speaker 1: That makes since.
Speaker 2: --District Building [John A. Wilson Building, Washington, D.C.].  I think I had--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --been working--
Speaker 1: So that takes us to about 1967 or so?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause I--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --'cause Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] hadn't been killed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: So the 'Harambee' TV show--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --nineteen sixty-three [1963]?
Speaker 2: Something like--yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, '67 [1967], or you say '67 [1967], yeah?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Something like that.  And I stayed in there, and I graduated in '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: Now wait a minute.  So the--so when did you have the idea for a shelter?
Speaker 2: That was during the, that was during the Mayor Washington time, when I first met Mayor Washington.  'Cause I nowhere to live, so I told him I needed a place to stay.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: I wanted to get a house.  And he said, "Imagene [HistoryMaker Bishop Imagene Stewart], he said you may be from Georgia, but we don't give away houses up here."  And that's when I learned self-sufficiency, if you will.  And that's when--
Speaker 1: So you didn't--did you make enough to get an apartment or rent a room or something, or--
Speaker 2: Yes.  I made, yeah, a room.  I, I had a room.  I told you this guy named Clarence Fisher, I like him 'cause he wasn't from the church.  And--
Speaker 1: Oh, so you lived with him?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was Clarence Fisher on Tennessee Avenue Northeast.  And let me see; yeah, Tennessee Avenue was when the school from--let me see, trying to think back--Tennessee Avenue--and that's when I, I went on 'Harambee' and told folk I needed a place to open a shelter 'cause I, 'cause of where I was living at.  The guy had been very nice, but he really didn't have room for what I wanted to do.  And, Clarence Fisher--that's when Mayor Washington told me they don't give away houses up here.  And, and so I was doing pretty well then 'cause I was working at the District Building three days a week.  So I managed to borrow some money, and I got a house at 214 P Street.  You could look up and see the sky and look down and see the ground.  And when I went on 'Harambee,' when I went on 'Harambee' and I told the folk what I wanted to do, honey, by the time I got back to P Street, they had hammers and sheets and this and that, thus began the House of Imagene [House of Imagene Shelter and Women's Center, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay--
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: --so you own the property on P Street that you--
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  They started working on it.
Story_ID: 629881
Speaker 1: You spoke--earlier we were talking about knowing Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] fairly well.  I mean when did you really meet him to be able to talk to him and--
Speaker 2: At McIntosh [McIntosh County, Georgia], at the citizenship ed--
Speaker 1: Okay, all right--
Speaker 2: --education program [Citizenship Education Program].
Speaker 1: --so you had established that relationship--
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: --then.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, now, about the time that you started the shelter [House of Imagene Shelter and Women's Center, Washington, D.C.] was about the time that Dr. King was, was assassinated, right?
Speaker 2: I started the shelter in '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: Okay, well, he was assassinated--
Speaker 2: That was after--
Speaker 1: --before--yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was after the--it was after--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I, I, to tell the truth, I think that was publicly when I with the shelter '72 [1972].  I had it really before then.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you really had started it before then.
Speaker 2: Yeah, publicly, if you will, in '72 [1972] is when they had the big press conference and thing.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you didn't--had you started it around--you, you said you started it after--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --he was assassinated, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  Yeah, it was about '69 [1969] or something like that.
Speaker 1: Sixty-eight [1968].  Yeah, he was killed in '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, so, so, so--
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about when you heard about Dr. King being assassinated.  I mean where were you and what were you doing?
Speaker 2: Cried like a baby.
Speaker 1: How, how did you hear about it?
Speaker 2: Where was I?  Think I was up the Washington Tech [Washington Technical Institute; University of the District of Columbia, Washington, D.C.] when he got assassinated.  I was in school.  I think it was in '68 [1968].  Yeah, I was in school when he was assassinated.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Did you go to the funeral?
Speaker 2: No.  I think they had a memorial service here, I think.  But D.C. [Washington, D.C.] all that--they burning up the place and that--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's big, big riots, some of the biggest riots--
Speaker 2: And we--
Speaker 1: --in American history.
Speaker 2: --and we didn't do nothing but hurt ourself.  Nobody got hurt but us.
Speaker 1: Now the, the riots in D.C. after the, the murder of Dr. King were recently depicted in a movie called 'Talk to Me,' which is about the--or, or--yeah.
Speaker 2: Petey Greene?
Speaker 1: Yeah, by Petey Greene--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --by, by Petey Greene.
Speaker 2: My great friend.
Speaker 1: Did you know Petey?
Speaker 2: Oh, god, yes, oh yes.  And that's a story.  His wife [Judy C. Greene], his widow, even today she comes over here and volunteers, even today.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you see the movie?
Speaker 2: 'Cause--it wasn't the truth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's why I didn't--yeah.
Speaker 1: That's what I've heard, heard, heard it wasn't.
Speaker 2: Unh-un, it just wasn't, it wasn't Petey.  I knew Petey.  That, that wasn't him, wasn't--
Speaker 1: What was he like?  I mean what was the difference in the movie and what he was like in real life?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: They put a lot of BS in it.  They put a lot of BS in it, and--
Speaker 2: Like what, for instance, like?
Speaker 1: Tried to make him like he didn't have a family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That wasn't--he always loved his family, loved his children.  He always talked about Peaches [ph.] and Pine [Ralph Waldo Greene, III], Peaches and Pine, and that's why it wasn't in there.
Speaker 2: Those were his children?
Speaker 1: Children, yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that was not in the movie.  And they shouldn't have done that, 'cause they, them children needed a legacy, too.

Speaker 1: Let me see, so I think--see, it was in--I graduated in '72 [1972].  I got a job at the [U.S.] Government Printing Office [U.S. Government Publishing Office].  Honey, when they give me my first check, I went back to the payroll office, and I told them, "It must be some kind of mistake.  Ah, honey, I don't get this kind of money."  I'll never forget that, from a little girl from Dublin, Georgia making this kind of money?  And payroll, they said, "No, that's it; check is correct."  Dublin, Georgia, making this kind of--at the Government Printing Office.  They told me three places in Washington [D.C.] I was told not to work at: the Bureau of Engraving [U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing]; the, there, the post office; and the Government Printing Office.  And the best decision I ever made was when I went and worked for the Government Printing Office.  Those people helped me at the shelter [House of Imagene Shelter and Women's Center, Washington, D.C.], the coworkers, whatever they call--knew what I was trying to do.
Story_ID: 629883
Speaker 1: Only thing that turned on me is being, being a Republican, loving the flag, 'cause black folk ain't supposed to do that.
Speaker 2: So you had trouble with other black people?
Speaker 1: Oh yes, oh yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Oh yes.  I'm sorry.  That was my choice, but was, it's been detrimental to me.  Liberation theology, fine, when I was kind of traveling around with Dr. James Cone [HistoryMaker James H. Cone].
Speaker 2: Now when did you meet him?
Speaker 1: When he put out that little red book. I call it the little red book.
Speaker 2: Well, what's the name--what's it called?
Speaker 1: It's liber- liberation theology ['Black Theology and Black Power,' James H. Cone], but I used to call it--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --the little red book.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But he was a great human being.
Speaker 2: Where did you meet him?  I mean in what context?
Speaker 1: He was here, he was here in Washington for something.  And I read the little red book.  And, and he told me, "Just stay on this path, and you will be all right."  But I got off that path, 'cause I didn't want to be in the black only stuff.  I'm sorry.  I wasn't raised like that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I was not raised that way.  But they all turned on me.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay, so James--so, you were impressed by James Cone, but then you didn't--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, but I, I--just something about that liberation theology, 'cause that mean a certain, certain people I had to shun.  I couldn't pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America (laughter).  And I--that wasn't me.
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't know.  It doesn't sound like that, that's a feature of liberation theology, that you could not do that.  I don't think they, they do a lot of that, but I don't think that--
Speaker 1: No, they don't, they don't do that.
Speaker 2: --you know.  But I don't think that they, they have anything--
Speaker 1: Even, even--
Speaker 2: --against it.
Speaker 1: --I knew some black churches now because of liberation theology have taken the American flag out of their churches.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  Now when did you--you said you already--always thought about becoming a minister.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Since you, you sat in the pulpit with your father [J.C. Bigham], right?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.  I think the, the ministers, like I knew the ministers--I'm not talking about this new bunch you got out here now.  I mean, the old fashioned preachers.  We could--I always wanted to be like that, the old fashioned preachers that did not teach liberation theology.  And I--
Speaker 2: So do, do you have an opinion of what should be taught in church?
Speaker 1: Teach from the Bible.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Don't make up your own theology.
Speaker 2: Well, okay (laughter).  But do you have a sense that the Bible is a, is a piece of theol- theology itself in a sense, or--
Speaker 1: I think people have made it their own theology.  They have fixed the Bible in a way that it is anti-white.  That's what Dr. James Cone did.  He fixed it in a way to appease him.  And if I hadn't have kept my head on straight, I'd went right along with him.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 629884
Speaker 1: So, in your opinion, the Bible existed separate from theology, and it shouldn't be (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think so, when you turn it around to appease yourself.  I'm sorry.  When you turn it around to appea- if--liberation from what?  Liberation from white people?
Speaker 1: No, I--well, just to, if I may, I know when I first heard the term liberation theology, it was used by white minister in, in, in college to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I never heard any white ministers use liberation.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And it was--
Speaker 2: Never.
Speaker 1: --it was used as a, to, to describe the theology applied to the liberation of Latin American countries, the pe- the people in Latin America--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --you know, so.  That (laughter)--and so, I've heard black theology being used to describe James Cone's [HistoryMaker James H. Cone] ideas.  But--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah, true.
Speaker 1: --but I--
Speaker 2: But I'm, I'm, I'm sorry I've got to learn--I still be in reconciliation.  As I told you, most of the preachers call me Tommie Mae [ph.], Uncle Tom, Aunt Jemima.
Speaker 1: But why would they say that?  I mean what, what do you do in terms of reconciliation that, that--
Speaker 2: 'Cause I work with white people.
Speaker 1: --they wouldn't.  Okay, so they, they don't think you're supposed to work with them?
Speaker 2: They don't think it's--they think I should--'cause that's the way some folk in SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee], if I remember my history, thought about Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] when you work with a race of people.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so, I know the former mayor of Washington [D.C.] was the head of SNCC at one time--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --[HistoryMaker] Marion Barry, yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  That's why he over in Anacostia [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Ever since he's been there, white people done stopped moving there.
Speaker 1: All right, so, so what did you--now did you go to theologic- theological school, or did you go to--
Speaker 2: Yes, American University [Washington, D.C.], Wesley Seminary [Wesley Theological Seminary, Washington, D.C.] really.  That's what's the name.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you went to Wesley Seminary.
Speaker 2: Yes, Wesley Seminary.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I got a Ph.D. from university in Texas.  And his here's the name of it.
Speaker 1: So you got a Ph.D. in what, in theology or what?
Speaker 2: Human relations.
Speaker 1: Human relations, okay.
Speaker 2: How to work with white people.
Story_ID: 629885
Speaker 1: --You ordained before you started your shelter [House of Imagene Shelter and Women's Center, Washington, D.C.]?  Or--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and were you ordained by a Baptist minister?
Speaker 2: Baptist, yes.
Speaker 1: And what are the qualifications for that?  You just, you just, I mean, they--you have to have a revelation or something, or--
Speaker 2: Well, you, you, you believe that the good Lord sent you that way.  There are a lot of people now call theyself, and I, I don't believe that I called myself.  I believe that I am sent by God to minister to his people.  And, and since I've been in the ministry, I think I've done a pretty job--pretty good job of saying, "Thus said the Lord."  Says sometimes when I've fallen out of favor, so to speak, because people don't, don't care for what I stand for, or they don't want me to go to a nightclub, or go out to dinner at certain places.  Well, that's where they come for that--I told you what my mama [Mattie Watkins Bigham] and my sister said, that my problem is that I deal with so many low class people.  And that has stuck with me all my life.  But that's the part I believe the good Lord sent me to be for those people, if you will, because you can't be, if you will, with the bourgeoisie all the time, although I could be, but it's just not my calling.  I like to be with the least of these.
Story_ID: 629886
Speaker 1: Now where were your children [Michael Johnson and Jeffrey Johnson] when you were going to school, and--were they, were they in Georgia (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Remember, they was--
Speaker 1: --or did they come up?
Speaker 2: --with my mama [Mattie Watkins Bigham].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, when they were small, they stayed with my mama.  When I came here for the March on Washington, they was in Dublin [Georgia] with my mama--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --until they went into the [U.S.] Air Force.  And--
Speaker 1: Until--wait, wait.  You said until you went into the Air Force?
Speaker 2: No.  They went into the--
Speaker 1: They went into--
Speaker 2: --Air--yeah to--
Speaker 1: Oh, so they stayed--they were raised by your mother, basically?
Speaker 2: Yes, they were.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, they was.
Speaker 1: So they didn't come to D.C. [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Though one of them live here now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So when he got out of Bolling Air Force Base [Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling, Washington, D.C.] he just decided to live here.  And I remember so vividly when Michael got out of the Bolling--they got out of Germany I think, he come here.  He come to my house and said, "Which one of these my rooms?"  I said, I said, "Well, let's sit down and talk about your rent."  He said, "You wouldn't charge your own son rent."  I said, "How you think I'm staying here?"  And I says, "Now you, what makes you make, make, make you think you any better than I am?  What you makes think these lights come on?  So it's somebody paying that."  I said, I said, "I've never been in the service.  I've never been in the service, but don't y'all have something called barracks?  Y'all don't have that no more," (laughter).  He got his bags and went out the door.  Well, I, I, I always thought you in the service, you live in the barracks.  Okay, that was the end of that.
Story_ID: 629887
Speaker 1: Now when you started the, the shelter [House of Imagene Shelter and Women's Center, Washington, D.C.], now what, what--how did you--you just had the idea, and you just--I mean, where did the, where did the women come from that were--
Speaker 2: Well, when I first--
Speaker 1: Were, were they--
Speaker 2: --went on television [on 'Harambee'], the word just went out.  That--as I told folk how I had to sleep in the park [Lincoln Park, Washington, D.C.].  I said, "I've tried to provide a place that you all don't have to do what I did."
Speaker 1: Now did you know women then that were being abused and--
Speaker 2: Yes, but I--
Speaker 1: --needed shelter?
Speaker 2: --ain't nothing I could do, wasn't nothing I could do to help 'em.
Speaker 1: Okay, did--
Speaker 2: Didn't have nothing.
Speaker 1: --did people come to you--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --for help?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And at that time I had an open door policy, but you can't do that now 'cause you could be killed everybody in your family and come in and kill us (laughter).  I don't do that--
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: --no more.
Speaker 1: --you were letting people come and stay with you.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes.
Speaker 1: Can--
Speaker 2: That was a big house I had.
Speaker 1: Can you remember the first time you did that?  Or is it--
Speaker 2: The same day I went on--
Speaker 1: Did--
Speaker 2: --Channel 9 [WDVM-TV; WUSA-TV, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: No, I mean the first--
Speaker 2: People came--
Speaker 1: --I mean the first time you let somebody stay with you that, that needed help.
Speaker 2: The same day, needed help.
Speaker 1: So you hadn't started dealing with anybody that needed help until you were on TV?
Speaker 2: I've had--I had calls 'cause some people heard of my work.  Even before I got that building they heard about my work.  But then, they physically came when I got a building.
Speaker 1: That's what I'm asking.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: When did your work start?  Not the building, but when did--did you know some people that had problems that needed assistance or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I was living on Tennessee [Avenue], living in one room.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There were people who stayed there, and I'm living in one room--
Speaker 1: But you brought people in--
Speaker 2: --yeah.  Yes, in that--
Speaker 1: --with you?  Okay.
Speaker 2: --and where I am now.  There are folk who come here to stay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's why you see them cards over there.  I have to keep--you know, some- somebody knock on the door who wants--who need help.  I got some room; I got help for them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you said that place was too small, and you were in somebody else's place actually then, right, when you were on Tennessee?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  I was in Clarence Fisher's [ph.] house, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 2: And he got tired of them people knocking on the door.  He couldn't rest (laughter).  And that's why he put me out.  But when he, he put me out, thank God, P Street--Mayor Washington [Walter Washington] came along.
Story_ID: 629888
Speaker 1: Well, tell us, tell us a, a story about somebody that you helped.  I mean, it's, I know there's been a lot of people, but what's a typical story?
Speaker 2: Well, there's a big shot lady that I know right now who, who was a victim of domestic violence, but because she was so well known, she couldn't go nowhere.  She couldn't because if you--she went to a room in a hotel everybody knew her there.  And I was thanking God every time I see her on TV now.  I, I, I say to myself, that was somebody that I was--and she's, she does, she sends us a donation every now and then 'cause we helped her over the hump.  That's what it's about; it's giving back after somebody has helped you out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's what, that's, that's basically what it is.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what's your approach to helping somebody that's a victim of domestic violence or--
Speaker 2: Well, we sit, we--'cause on the phone, we sit around and we talk, see what kind of problems you're having, what you need; are you working?  Do you want to come in and live on me for free?  I work with the city.  If some people having problems that I really can't deal with, 'cause maybe you--some need food.  I can't give everybody food that knock on the door.  So I have to have a means whereby you can go there and get something to eat.  I work closely with SOME, So Others Might Eat, where you can get a decent meal, cooked meal.  We all work together as--
Speaker 1: Oh, SOME is the name of an organization.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And the, this, the word stands for So Others Might Eat, SOME.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, I just got it.  I just wanted to make sure that whoever is listening to this know that--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --when they--okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: And that's an agency here in D.C. [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And it, it, it has to be a way.
Story_ID: 629889
Speaker 1: Especially--and there's another part of this ministry that I love is our homeless veterans, our veterans who defend this country.  You come home you ain't got nothing, arms, legs (makes noise) so we got to do more.  That's what I'm really getting ready to get, get into now, to helping, helping more, I should say, our homeless veterans, 'cause these young men dying nineteen and twenty that doesn't have anything.  So I'm getting ready now really to do some more for our homeless veterans.
Speaker 2: So you, you're saying that the government is not doing enough for them?
Speaker 1: Oh no, absolutely not.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Absolutely not.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, all right, so they send them off to fight, but they don't do anything for them when they come back.
Speaker 1: They send them to fight, yes, 'cause it's a part of your responsibility.  If you don't like it, don't go.  Do like what y'all used to do years ago, go to Canada.
Speaker 2: Or just don't go (laughter).
Speaker 1: Just don't go.  That's all you gotta do.  If you don't like, don't go, but then the men I know, who are men, they go, 'cause it's a part of your citizenship--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --part of your responsibility to fight for your country.  But if you don't think this your country, no, don't go, be that's the way you feel.  But mostly--I say about that I think about most black folk, they don't feel that way.  They, they will fight for this country really quicker than some white people will.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you're saying they will or they--
Speaker 1: Oh, they will.
Speaker 2: They will, okay.
Speaker 1: They will fight.  Yes, they will.
Speaker 2: But they're doing it out of--you said they're doing it out of--
Speaker 1: Love for their own country.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Not for Africa--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --for their own country.
Speaker 2: You said a little while ago you thought most black people were not patriotic, really.
Speaker 1: I didn't say most black folk wasn't patri- patriotic.
Speaker 2: Well, asked a question.  Let me ask it again then.  Do you think most people, black people, are really patriotic?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, I do.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But they loud mouths--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --would give you the impression that most black folk are not patriotic.
Speaker 2: Okay, but that's erroneous as far as you're concerned?
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: I look at the Tuskegee Airmen, fighting--fought for their country, still fighting.
Story_ID: 629890
Speaker 1: Now, so you said that your appearance on television [on 'Harambee'] was able to generate resources to help you form (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, because see, we get--
Speaker 1: --get your shelter [House of Imagene Shelter and Women's Center, Washington, D.C.] together.
Speaker 2: --no donations.  Like a lot of these people get stuff from these different places.  We don't get that.  We have to scrounge, churches, if you will.
Speaker 1: So you, you don't get any grant money--
Speaker 2: No, no, grant mon--
Speaker 1: --from the federal government or--
Speaker 2: No, no federal government.
Speaker 1: --or the district or--
Speaker 2: 'Cause see--
Speaker 1: --the city?
Speaker 2: --they would have ate me alive if they'd found out George W. Bush [President George Walker Bush] was giving us money.  "Oh, honey, that's, that's why she do; that's why she love Baby Bush is because he's putting money over there."  He ain't put nothing over here, honey.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you, you, you, you love the Bush administration?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, I love the family, not just that, that much that I love them for being president.  I just know the family, a good, loving American family.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Love black folk.  I don't care what you heard.  It is not that, but, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so you're not part of the faith based initiatives or anything.  You haven't received--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --any money from them [White House Office of Faith-based and Community Initiatives; White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships]?
Speaker 2: We ain't got nary a nickel from wherever y'all call it, the--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --faith based.  There are a lot of people tell me: "How much money, Imagene [HistoryMaker Bishop Imagene Stewart], you got from Bush's faith based initiative."  I said, "I, I just heard of it.  I ain't asking for nothing."
Speaker 1: Okay.  So is it against your--I mean, well, somebody must be giving, so--
Speaker 2: Absolute, Colin Powell [HistoryMaker General Colin L. Powell].
Speaker 1: --the people that, the people that give money, are you asking them for the money, or do they just give it?
Speaker 2: No, Colin--folks like my--I call him our leader.  Colin Powell has helped us more than any human being I know of, and I'm the founder.  I ought to know.  Colin Powell is a wonderful human being.  Don't ask for nothing, but he passed the word.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: Don't pass the plate.  He passed the word.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So people influenced by Colin Powell--
Speaker 2: Oh, sure.
Speaker 1: --have, have--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --donated money to the--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --the institution.
Speaker 2: People know George, George W. Bush, and George W. Bush don't give us nothing, but he knows how to pass the word.
Story_ID: 629891
Speaker 1: So what--how big is the operation?  I mean what, what, what--
Speaker 2: How much money we get a year?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Or, or not so much--well, you can, you can speak it on the terms of money; you can take--you can speak it of in, of it in terms of how many people you help, and what the--
Speaker 2: I would say our budget is twenty thousand [dollars] a year.  I think we help, I would say, about fifteen to twenty people a week.  It can be in the form of a bed to sleep in.  It could be going in there cooking yourself.  We don't, we don't cook for people.  You want to eat, I got the food here.  All you got to do is go in there and cook.  And you don't wanna, if you don't wanna fix yourself no food, then you don't eat, simple as that.  I think--that's just about it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when you--so your services I guess include providing food and shelter, and you provide counseling for people?
Speaker 2: I try not to get too much into counseling.  I try to work closely with Howard University Hospital [Washington, D.C.] for counseling, because when you're a public person, I've been threatened, you know, four or five times, so I have to be careful how I counsel people.  You--that's why I generally send you to Howard University Hospital where the professionals are.  I can give you tangible gospel, if you will, tangible gospel in terms of a place to eat and sleep and clothes.  But when it comes to professional help, I send you to the professionals--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because it's too dangerous now.  I used to--I did that earlier in my ministry, but it's, it's, it's, it's too dangerous now.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about a time when you tried to give somebody some counseling and it backfired?
Speaker 2: Because--oh yeah.  This, this one was in the newspaper.  A woman came here for help and, and went back, went around the corner where Bill [ph.] was.  "Well, Imagene [HistoryMaker Bishop Imagene Stewart] told me to come over here."  You see what I'm saying?  Then the police got to watch my door so I can't even go to the store.
Speaker 1: So Bill threatened you or--
Speaker 2: Yes, because she went and told him I told her she could come and stay here [House of Imagene Shelter and Women's Center, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: "I didn't really want to go to the shelter, but Imagene said I had to come to--Imagene said."  Unh-uh, so I'm very cautious now.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Can't do that now.  You--early in my ministry (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So just advising somebody to come here would be a problem.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's a dangerous business I tell people.
Speaker 1: The, the husbands or, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --or, or, or men looking for their women come here and--
Speaker 2: That's right, yes, Lord.
Speaker 1: --come, come here and--
Speaker 2: Knock on the--
Speaker 1: --knock on the door.
Speaker 2: --door, call me, "House of Imagene."  "Is Sarah over there?"  I said, "Sarah who?"  "Oh, you know who it is."  And you know, it's, it's a dangerous business.  And so even now I have to--
Speaker 1: Made a very--
Speaker 2: --have a good peephole.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have to have a good peephole to get out the door, because you know, your, your spouse think I'm keeping you against your will, so to speak.  Unh-uh, I can't do that no more.
Speaker 1: Ever have--men ever been arrest, arrested outside of here trying to get in?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Even sometimes when I'm at church I got to be very cautious who sit next to me.  It's, it's a danger.  You, if you may not believe it.  This is dangerous business.
Speaker 1: I believe it.  What's a, what's a worst case?  Is there a worst case scenario here that you've experienced since you've been here?
Speaker 2: Well, there was a woman who threw chicken grease on her husband.  He came here to whup my behind because she--he felt I influenced her to, to throw chicken grease on him.  So he gonna come over here and knock me down.  Unh-uh, it's a dangerous business.
Speaker 1: So did, had you advised this woman, or had, had she been part--
Speaker 2: I don't do that anymore.
Speaker 1: --part of--I mean had, had, had she been part of your shelter?  I mean she, had she come for services?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You have to be careful now.  Things, and things ain't like--
Speaker 1: So you don't tell people--you, you don't tell women that they should fight back or that they should--what if--
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.  You use your own--
Speaker 1: Use your--
Speaker 2: --prerogative.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You use--I'm sorry.  I can't do that no more--
Speaker 1: Okay, so you--
Speaker 2: --not if you want to live.
Speaker 1: Have, have you ever had a--so you, you refer people to Howard University Hospital.
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh, to get some--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --professional help.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.
Speaker 2: Get professional help.  No, I--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --can't do that stuff no more.
Story_ID: 629892
Speaker 1: Now you were--so you did this in addition to working for the federal government when you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, for the Government Printing Office.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you worked for the U.S. Government Printing Office [U.S. Government Publishing Office].
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: And then--
Speaker 2: --for twenty-five years.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when did you retire from--
Speaker 2: In '97 [1997].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  And, and then did you, did, did you take another full time job or did you--
Speaker 2: Well, I do a lot of part time work now.  I've taken part time jobs.  I, I do quite a bit of part time work.  Somebody called me--my most steadiest part time job is substitute teaching.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  When they ever have a vacancy, they say, "Imagene [HistoryMaker Bishop Imagene Stewart], can you come and stand in for a teacher or whatever?"  And that's my, really my basic part time job, is substitute teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so this, the shelter's [House of Imagene Shelter and Women's Center, Washington, D.C.] still running.  You said, you said you just moved, right, from the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they put us out.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did you own that place?  You, you didn't own the place you were living in?
Speaker 2: No, we was renting.
Speaker 1: You were, you were--okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and you have to go.  If you renting something, you have to go when the owner tell you to go.
Speaker 1: I see, okay.  'Cause the initial place you were telling me about was one that you bought, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was the first one, yeah.
Speaker 1: And what, what happened?  Did you--how did you lose that place?
Speaker 2: Well, it's a lot of, of circumstances I'd rather not talk about, yeah, just circumstances.  But we stayed on P Street thirty years, but the man bought the whole block just about.
Story_ID: 629893
Speaker 1: Now is there a, is there a particular story that you think is--I guess maybe the, your, the biggest success, success story I guess in terms of this, running the shelter [House of Imagene Shelter and Women's Center, Washington, D.C.] and doing your work.  I mean what was--
Speaker 2: I think the biggest success is that we still open.  That, now that's a success, forty-one years, forty-one years.  And my health is getting worse and worse as, as--I have a couple of women that I'm looking at that I'm gonna turn it over to, eventually.  But one of I had, she gonna push me out of here.  No, baby, you go when I get ready.  You come in when I get ready to go.  So, whenever the good Lord sees fit to take me home, then I don't care what you do.  You can take--'cause I got nothing I can do with it, but please don't push me out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have to be very careful, 'cause there are some people who see you, who, who feel, for one, that I got, that I got notoriety, just notori- I was in--but, honey, this come from hard work.  This comes from hard work, sleeping, can't sleep at night, folk knocking on the door all the time.  And then you go outside, "Hey Imagene [HistoryMaker Bishop Imagene Stewart], got any space over there?"  I mean, can't go nowhere.  But be that as it may, I've sustained since 1970s (unclear), officially '72 [1972], but, officially '72 [1972].  But I've been basically helping people most of my life.
Story_ID: 629894
Speaker 1: As I told you, I started a, a women's thing in Dublin [Georgia] called the Ebony Women's Soci- that's still operating.
Speaker 2: Oh, you were telling--you started to tell us about that, and I, I cut you off--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --and we started talking about something else.  But, but when--
Speaker 1: I'm--
Speaker 2: --did that start, and how did you--and what was it, and how did you start?
Speaker 1: When, when I got pregnant, I wanted other women to see how I sustained myself.  That's when the Ebony Women's Society started.
Speaker 2: Well, you mean that was after you had--you, you gave birth, you wanted--
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --Michael [Michael Johnson], yeah.
Speaker 2: So you were, you were, you were fifteen or so when you started the Ebony Women Society.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, uh-huh.  Ebony Women's Society.  I wanted--
Speaker 2: That's 1965.
Speaker 1: --teenager, I wanted the teenage mothers to know after I had been treated so badly how to sustain yourself as, as, as a young mother.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I won't ever forget that.  And it's still operating.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So it's still going on.
Speaker 1: Still going on in Dublin.
Speaker 2: All right.  And what, what do they--I mean so it's just a support net--
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: --network of--
Speaker 1: --just a support network, yeah.
Speaker 2: --of women that, that had--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 2: --babies out of wedlock, or, or--
Speaker 1: --who had babies out of wedlock.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: I'm telling you I had a time.  And folks didn't talk about--my worst thing was they talk about you so bad.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So what--how, how, how do you sustain yourself in, in the wake of all the criticism?
Speaker 1: Besides prayer, and I don't, I don't, I don't pray openly.  I, I don't do that.  I'm, I'm not what is called a outside show to the world.  It's dangerous.  I don't believe in outside shows to the world.  And, but I, I try to tell women how to make it, and it's, and it's hard to live.  That's why you see all these veins (laughter).  I've been through something, honey, in this sixty-five years.  And people--you know, when I tell people about (unclear) things I--they can't believe it.  I can't believe it's true.  I've been through something in these sixty-five years, honey.
Story_ID: 629895
Speaker 1: So when you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Besides leave the men alone?  I don't think it's even nothing that I would do differently.  I, I think I would choose my spouse or mates more carefully.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, now have you ever been married?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I would, I would--
Speaker 1: When, when were you married and--
Speaker 2: Abbott Stewart [ph.].  I think it was late '80s [1980s], I think, or something like that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was kind of a dumb question to ask you if you ever been married 'cause you got Stewart at the end of your name, and that's a married name.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So in the late '80s [1980s] you got married?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And--okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and--
Speaker 1: And
Speaker 2: --great veteran.  And--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I told him the only thing I got out of him was a membership in the American Legion Auxiliary, 'cause you had to have a husband to be in--I, I was the first black woman ever to be elected, national chapter in the American Legion Auxiliary, which is a half a million white women.  And I, I told him that that's the only thing he ever gave me, was a membership in the American Legion Auxiliary, and I thank you.  Have a good day.
Story_ID: 629896
Speaker 1: This is a question we always ask: what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I wish we could stop killing each other.  That will stop--that would help.  I, I wish we could, as Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] said, we could learn to live together on this planet, in this country.  I think that's about it.
Story_ID: 629897
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you've done to this point, what today would you--are you the most proud of?
Speaker 2: I would say the shelter because that's what I started out to do, and I think I've accomplished that.  Yeah, that's--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what are you--do you have any future pla- you, you said you were gonna pass it on to someone else.  And so that's your plan to perpetuate it and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that I hope somebody will take this work.  There's a young man who's been working with me for twenty-five years, Warren I. Johnson, Jr., I am hoping this young man will take this work over in my spirit, 'cause he know keep the name, same name, that, and my boys [Michael Johnson and Jeffrey Johnson] won't change his mind.
Speaker 1: I'm just thinking, now the name of the shelter is your name, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, the House of Imagene [House of Imagene Shelter and Women's Center, Washington, D.C.].  Somebody asked me, said, "Why would you call it the House of Imagene?"  'Cause I'm the one putting the money in it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's supposed to be that.
Speaker 1: But I just wondered if it didn't just calls attention to you being the, you know, for those angry spouses or angry husbands and, and boyfriends, you know.  That's not the best practice, but you know, it's--you said you've learned to deal with some of those issues.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Story_ID: 629898
Speaker 1: Now is there, is there a--have you ever investigated--I--or thought about like what might be the causes of, of this kind of violence, you know?
Speaker 2: Well, because of my history, it's comes right in the house.  It comes from within.  People can't learn to settle their own problems, as my father [J.C. Bigham]--my father thought he could make my mama [Mattie Watkins Bigham] over.  You cannot make grown people over.  You either get along with them or go on about your business, simple as that.  So that's what, what happened in my mother and father.  They just could not--I, I'm not just saying everything was his fault, because mama had some problems, too.  But I, I really think that there needs to be some--preachers now need to have classes for minister's wives.  There needs to be more preacher/wife public classes.  I'm not talking about private--public classes on how do you get along, these young women who coming along now marrying preachers.  Even we got more women now who are going into the ministry.  I cringe when I hear women who talk about their men, their husbands, "You just like your no good daddy."  What is that to tell a child, women who tell their children this kind of, of garbage?  So you want him to, to grow up be a nice young man, but you done cut him, cut his legs out from under him with that nasty garbage.
Speaker 1: So do you think that--now, you knew a lot of people in the Civil Rights Movement and still do.  Is domestic violence a issue in the--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --in the movement?
Speaker 2: No, 'cause I remember Coretta King [Coretta Scott King] started one time, and I think--I don't know who stopped her, but she wanted the, the Civil Rights Movement against domestic--I mean against violence not just to be street violence.  She tried to put domestic violence in that equation.  And somebody stopped her, because I used to get, well, information, et cetera.  But whatever it was about Coretta King and the center, they stopped the whole domestic violence thrust.
Speaker 1: I guess what I was asking was were there any figures in the civil rights, I guess, history that you know of in the Civil Rights Movement that are actually practitioners of domestic violence at home?  'Cause it seems like it would be a contradictory thing if you're for rights--
Speaker 2: No, I, I never knew of any, 'cause most of the people I knew were preachers.  And that's just something preachers don't do.  I'm sorry.  It's just something publicly.  And the women, wives they are with won't tell it, because they love to be comfortable.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They love to be--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: --Mrs. Somebody.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're saying that, that there, there is domestic violence among--
Speaker 2: There is domestic violence--
Speaker 1: --amongst preachers--
Speaker 2: --but they ain't gonna tell it.
Speaker 1: --preachers--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --necessarily, but, but, but it's not being--
Speaker 2: But the preach--
Speaker 1: --shared--
Speaker 2: --the preachers' wives--
Speaker 1: I mean their stories--
Speaker 2: --are not gonna tell it.
Speaker 1: --are not being shared.
Speaker 2: They love being comfortable.  And it's a comfortable life when you are the wife of Reverend Somebody.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  But, so you're saying it does exist, but nobody's talking about it.
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: In--
Speaker 2: Cause I, I--
Speaker 1: --amongst pre--
Speaker 2: --I was--
Speaker 1: --preachers anyway, not--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --necessarily people in civil rights.
Speaker 2: No--just what most of the civil rights people I know are preachers.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, you were in SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] that's why.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 629899
Speaker 1: Tell us about your family.  You've got now, you got two sons, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Michael [Michael Johnson] and Jeffrey [Jeffrey Johnson].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And they're both grown and--
Speaker 2: Yep they have grown--
Speaker 1: --born in--
Speaker 2: --and in they think late forties.  It's just somebody old, it must be them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your mother [Mattie Watkins Bigham] passed in '96 [1996] you said.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And daddy [J.C. Bigham] passed I think '94 [1994].
Speaker 1: Okay, so, and you're, you're no longer married, and so right now your family consist of I guess the people you--
Speaker 2: Just me and Warren [Warren I. Johnson, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Warren, now who is, who is Warren (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) My better half.
Speaker 1: I see, okay, all right.  That'll suffice I guess.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 629900
Speaker 1: Now is there anything I have not asked about that you want to, you think we ought to mention before I ask my last question?  Oh, I didn't ask you about getting the citation from President Bush.  Right, you received an award from the president, didn't you, or, or a mention?
Speaker 2: Yeah, from Daddy Bush--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --from, from Daddy Bush and honorable mention from Baby Bush [President George Walker Bush].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what award was this, the--
Speaker 2: Let me see, what, what that award was?  Something--I've forgot.  George H.W. Bush [President George Herbert Walker Bush]--it was an award for the shelter [House of Imagene Shelter and Women's Center, Washington, D.C.], yes, yes--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Geor- award for the shelter.  And then Daddy Bush told his son about my work, 'cause they had never heard of a Republican doing social service shelter.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and we thank God for that.
Speaker 1: So you were recognized by the older Bush in 1991--
Speaker 2: Old, daddy, um-hm, daddy.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --right?
Speaker 2: And (unclear) right.
Speaker 1: And then--
Speaker 2: That's who was president at that time.
Speaker 1: --in '92 [1992] you won the Living the Dream Award.
Speaker 2: From Sharon Pratt Kelly [HistoryMaker Sharon Pratt].
Speaker 1: Okay, she was the mayor then of--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's from the city--from the City of Washington [D.C.], right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And now you were, you served as the chaplain for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, or was that, that true?
Speaker 2: That is not true.
Speaker 1: That's not true, okay--
Speaker 2: I told him that--
Speaker 1: --all right.
Speaker 2: --him that was not true.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, all right.  I saw it in the literature and I just wanted to ask the question.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, yeah, no, that is--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --not true.
Story_ID: 629901
Speaker 1: And are, are you still the pastor of--
Speaker 2: Greater Pearly Gate.
Speaker 1: Okay, Baptist church, all right.  And--
Speaker 2: Baptist Mission [Pearly Gate Baptist Mission, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Baptist Mission, okay.
Speaker 2: Baptist Mission.
Speaker 1: And, and where is it?  Is it here, here in D.C. [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right down the street.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We have a mission.
Speaker 1: All right, so, do you have a, a very big congregation or--
Speaker 2: No, because I'm a street preacher--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --basically.
Speaker 1: So do you do like the food bank stuff and that sort of thing out of the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We do a Thanksgiving thing on Thanksgiving.  I've done it for the last forty years, and--let me see--but as I say, we--anybody can get food, clothing, can spend the night.  The most we would have is, is people--and I'm sorry.  There are some folks don't want to work.  They hear about me, and they think they can get over.  They just want somewhere to--I can't stay here for free, so ain't nobody else gonna stay here for free.  So all I'm saying, I'll help you over the hump, but that hump is very short.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now is there anything I missed that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: No.  I think we done--I done spilled my guts.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Story_ID: 629902
Speaker 1: Well, the last question is--oh, I have a question.  What is the--I see--I had a note here about something called the National Black Republican Party [sic. National Black Republican Association].  Do you know anything about that?
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm a member.
Speaker 1: The National Black Republican Party.
Speaker 2: National Black Republican Party.
Speaker 1: Okay, now what is that?  We know about the Republican Party, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's just made up of, of, of black Republicans.  I ain't happy about it, 'cause I don't like to be in all black stuff.
Speaker 1: Now where, where--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Don't get up.
Speaker 1: --where are you going?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: Gonna give you the government, I mean--
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, that's--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --that's okay.
Speaker 2: --the national--
Speaker 1: We can get that afterwards.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I just wanted you to tell us about what--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --when was it started, and who started it and--
Speaker 2: Frances Rice--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --started the, the National Black Republican Party.  And--
Speaker 1: Is she here in D.C. [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: No.  She's in Florida.  And I enjoy working with her because, as I told you, I don't need a adjective in front of Republican.  I don't need to be a black Republican.  I'm just a Republican.
Speaker 1: Well, this is the National Black Republican Party.
Speaker 2: I hear you.  I hear you.  I--
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: --I, I ain't for it, but I went on and joined.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the--is this like a coalition of black Republicans--
Speaker 2: Um-hm, black folk, yeah.
Speaker 1: --that are in the Republican Party?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause they--we're so few.  And she felt we needed some- somebody to talk to when you're having problems or whatever, 'cause, 'cause--
Speaker 1: Well, why, why, why can't black Republicans talk to the white Republicans in the--
Speaker 2: That's, that's my point.  I ain't had no problems talking to white Republicans, but evidently somebody must be having some problems.  I don't have no problem.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So you don't think it's a real problem then?
Speaker 2: No, unh-uh.
Speaker 1: It's--so are you trying to persuade the black Republicans to disorganize themselves and to just get into the regular Republican Party?
Speaker 2: I, I think that's a good idea, and I told her.  I say, "You ought to be--we ought--," 'cause see now, even churches now, there are a lot of women preachers said they don't want to be in a women preachers' organization.  They want to be in a preachers' organization.  They want to be with the men.  They don't want to be with no women, and I agree.  The same thing with the Republicans.  Shouldn't be no black Republican, just Republicans.
Story_ID: 629903
Speaker 1: I think the, the key issue here is do you think that people should--well, you were part of the Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And that was a case where black people organized themselves around their interest to petition the larger community for their civil rights, right.  So you don't see this as the same kind of an effort--
Speaker 2: No, because--
Speaker 1: --to--okay.
Speaker 2: --the Civil Rights Movement I was in had white folks.  I wasn't in no black Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 1: Well, the country in, at large had white people, and there were even white people in the Civil Rights Movement--
Speaker 2: That's what--
Speaker 1: --right, yeah.
Speaker 2: --that, that's my point.
Speaker 1: But, but, but black folks had to organize it as, as a Civil Rights Movement.  There wasn't one before, unless I'm wrong.
Speaker 2: Well, every movement I ever been in had white folks in it.  I don't know who organized it.  That's another question.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Whatever movement I--
Speaker 1: But you're clear that, you, you, you are clear that the Civil Rights Movement--I mean Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] movement was organized by black people initially?  Or do you think that was organized--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: --by white people?
Speaker 2: --I, I don't, I don't feel no (unclear) 'cause everything, everything I saw, even in the SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference], had white people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay so you wouldn't--
Speaker 2: They have tried to change it.
Speaker 1: --you wouldn't, you wouldn't consider SCLC a black organization and function?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Absolutely not, neither is the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's why it's colored peoples.
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter), all right.
Story_ID: 629904
Speaker 1: Now, okay, the last question is similar to legacy but a little different.  Ma'am how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I guess I can go that route, what, what Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] said, but I think I'd like to be remembered as somebody who certainly took her last to help other people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There was a woman--I'm a great believer in fraternal groups, the Eastern Stars [Order of the Eastern Star], the Masons, the Elks.  And had it not been for them, I couldn't have gotten as far, if you will, into the helping peoples business.  And I just hope that these groups will help Warren [Warren I. Johnson, Jr.] keep the shelter [House of Imagene Shelter and Women's Center, Washington, D.C.] going.  I thank God for a man from Texarkana, Texas, Dr. Calvin W. Rolark, who believed in me, Attorney Wilhelmina Jackson Rolark [HistoryMaker Wilhelmina Rolark], who believed in me and helped me get started.  I just thank God for their memory.  They gone on now, but Lord knows they help me get it started.  And that's the, the single person--a lot of people have helped, but nobody has done what Dr. Calvin Rolark to keep the shelter going.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, thank you very much for sharing with us.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
