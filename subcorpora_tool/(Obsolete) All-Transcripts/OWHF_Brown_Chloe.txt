 Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Tuesday, January 3, 2012, and I   m in Tulsa,  Oklahoma interviewing Chloe Brown. This interview is being conducted  as part of the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame Oral History Project.  Chloe Brown was inducted into the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame in  2011. Thank you for joining us today.  It   s a privilege to be here. I feel real honored to be able to interview  today, so I   m excited about sharing.  Well, let   s begin by learning a little bit more about you. Could you tell  us where you grew up and give us a little background into your early  life?  I absolutely can. I am an Oklahoma girl, born and raised right here in  Tulsa, Oklahoma and had an experience of living on Greenwood Street.  That   s phenomenal to look back now and see how changes have taken  place with Greenwood. But I went to Tulsa Public Schools, so I   ve been  here mostly all my childhood life and adult life. I love Oklahoma.  Well, let   s go back to those early school memories. What was your first  school?  My first school was John Burroughs Elementary School, and it   s located  on North Cincinnati, and my early memories of   everything was right in  the community and in the neighborhood. We had a principal who we  absolutely loved and adored. Our teachers were hands-on, community  wise, and everything was like a family. And we hear now that it takes a  village to raise a child. They really implemented that.  And that first school, was that your elementary school?  5  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  My elementary school, yes. John Burroughs. We were the first class to  integrate John Burroughs, also, and so that was a milestone to work with  other cultures and work with other different students. But I had a  wonderful life, and I often say that we were poor, but we didn   t know  we were poor. I can remember times that    my mom did housework,  and she would always come home with either an apple or some type of  fruit. But it was a precious memory to sit on the curb   it was safe to do  that then, to wait for her to get off of the bus. She always had something  for us, to give us. But not only just the fruit, but it was always some  words of inspiration and encouragement.  She wanted a better life for her children and she often spoke of that. You  know, that we could dare or dream to do and be anything, even though  during that time it was pretty limited. But with our mom, the sky was the  limit and the things that she inspired us with, even though she was doing  housework. Our home was clean, our home was loving. I came from a  family where my father was in the home and my mom. And they taught  us values and principles that have been lifelong things that I   ve  implemented in my own life and with my own children. And so I had  said earlier we were poor, but we didn   t realize we were poor because  we were happy and just the little things meant so much.  The times where we would eat together, we would pray together, eat  together. My father was a minister, and so it was just wonderful  memories of family and times of sharing and times of hands-on with our  parents. So, I will always cherish those memories of my parents and the  things they instilled in all of us. There were six children in the home,  and we all had wonderful experiences of what it was like being a child,  even in the North Tulsa area and community.  Were your parents from Oklahoma?  My parents were from Pawnee, Oklahoma. So, yes, we are Oklahoman. I  always say my favorite classic is the Wizard of Oz, and as I got older, I  said,    Dorothy had the right saying when she said,    There   s no place like  home,    but she had the wrong state because it should have been  Oklahoma because home is in Oklahoma.    So, I often laugh about,     There is no place like home.    I have lived in Texas at one time, but I  always came back to Oklahoma.  And what brought your family to Tulsa?  Well, I think a better opportunity for my father in ministry and also  being able to work. He was a minister who worked. He did his ministry,  but he also worked. And that was just wonderful to see him balance both  things; family, ministry, and work.  6  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  So, six kids, where are you in the order?  Wow, let   s see. I am the middle child. Kind of spoiled, though. When  the other two younger siblings came along, it was kind of hard to give up  that place, that position of being the baby because I had been the baby  for a little while, and so when the two younger ones came on the scene it  was quite difficult. But my mom had a way of   and my dad   of letting  us all know that we were important, we were special, and we all had our  place. So, I was kind of spoiled, didn   t want to give up that place, but  eventually I did. And I feel so honored that I was the first out of my  siblings to go to college, and that was quite an honor. It was really an  honor to be able to get a higher education, and so my younger siblings  followed me after I went to college. They also knew that nothing was  impossible for them and they could go also. My oldest sister   let me  retrace that. I was the one who finished college. My oldest sister started   college  and then got married, but I was determined to go and get my  degree and it happened. So, my parents were so proud, and I was proud  also, because I was the first to complete a degree in college.  Well, growing up, you   re young, you   re running around North Tulsa and  everybody has their eye on you because I   m sure it   s a tight, close  community.  Absolutely.  And it   s probably hard to get into trouble.  Absolutely. It was very hard. (Laughter) That was during the time that  your neighbor could spank you, and you would get another spanking  when you got home. And they just worked together. The neighbors  would say,    Now, you know your mom and dad would not want you  doing that,    and you knew that if you were in trouble somewhere,  someone would see it and they would correct you, and so those were  precious memories, too, that we had neighbors who took it upon  themselves to instruct you the right way, to say    You know better, or  you have not been raised to do that or say that.    So that was quite fun. I  got in trouble a lot. I really did.  No, you didn   t.  Oh, I did, I did, I did. (Laughter) They said,    PK   s kid,    I was that.  Well, what would you do for fun growing up?  Wow, what did we do for fun growing up? Now, I   m from a pretty strict  7  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Pentecostal background, so our    fun    back then   I   m trying to think,  what did we do for fun? Because everything was pretty limited, couldn   t  do this and couldn   t do that. So, I used to want to play tetherball. I don   t  know, that   s an old term, and I was really good at it, and I liked sports.  And during the time coming up, we did a lot of playing with marbles. I  was a tomboy. I liked, like I mentioned, the tetherball, the marbles, and I  liked paper dolls. We couldn   t afford the real nice paper dolls that you  would get at TG Y and Kress   I   m going way back  Those stores are  nonexistent now.  So, we would cut paper dolls out of the newspaper. I think our neighbor  had the paper, and she would let us have that section, so my sister and I  would cut paper dolls out of the newspaper. And then sometimes we  would get an old magazine and we would cut people out of the  magazines and we would make up stories and scenes. I can remember  also, we would see the Miss America pageant, and we would pretend  that we were   our paper dolls were being Miss America, or just  wonderful memories of that, just interacting with my sister and her little  friend with our little paper dolls that were actually not the pretty ones  that are in color and the Barbie   s and all of that, but little things that we  could get out of the newspaper and the magazine. But we were quite  happy.  And how many days a week would you find yourself in church?  Wow. (Laughs) Probably four times a week because we would have  service in our home. We would go to church, and we would have prayer  and church services right in our home and people could come there. So,  really, a lot. I can remember saying things like,    It doesn   t take all of  this,    and    Wow     (Laughs) But you grow up and you realize that     good moral values  and character is very important , and  people  would  come and sing and share  about the goodness of God . I am so glad that I  had that a part of my culture. Wouldn   t give it up for  anything .  So, service was in your home.  Absolutely, absolutely.  How big of a congregation?  Well, it would be really small. It wasn   t a really big congregation, during  the week especially. I would say maybe seven to eight people, and it   s so  funny. I can laugh and think of the memories of this. (Laughs) They  would play tambourines, but they would also play on pots. I mean, I  don   t know of any   I mean, I   m going way back. They would just  praise God with anything that they could find. So, I have lots of  8  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  memories of that, just singing and clapping your hands and laughing and  praising God. Those are the memories that I   ll always cherish and look  back on. I know it probably sounds real funny, pots, but yes, they would  actually use several pots to make tones and beats. It was enjoyable.  What was the name of the congregation? Did it have a name?  Well, the name of the church that we went to was called Mason Temple  Church of God and Christ. But my dad was an evangelist. He didn   t  really have a particular name of the church. If anything, the House Full  of Holiness, if anything. (Laughs) But it   s so funny, and I   m thinking of  my brother. Everyone   I was middle, and so I thought it was just really  cool and phenomenal and    I wanted this.    But my brother and older  sister, they just like,    Oh, my gosh     It wasn   t cool to them at all. They  wanted no parts, so those were some fun times.  Well, moving back to school, was there a subject you tended to gravitate  toward?  You know, there really was. I really enjoyed poetry and I also enjoyed  speech and acting, but I never went into that. But I like plays and I  always liked things like that, where you would have to recite things. And  I can remember a teacher who was so inspirational and inspiring in my  life, because I didn   t have a very good self-concept. I felt like I was too  tall and didn   t have the right look. She said to me one day,    You can be  anything you want to be. Stand up tall. Stand up straight. Aim for the  moon, and you   ll fall among the stars,    and that   s when I decided I  wanted to be an educator because she made me feel so good inside.  When I would come to her classroom it was like everybody is accepted,  everybody is important, everybody is somebody and I said,    You know,  one day, I   m going to be a teacher and I   m going to be a drum major for  those kids who feel low self-esteem and who feel like they don   t  measure up or they   re not good enough or they   re from the wrong side  of the track or they don   t have what it takes.    So, I remember her. She  had me in lots of little plays and writing poetry, and so I really liked that.  Also, I liked P.E. I liked gym. It was pretty cool.  Well, it   s great how those early memories really help shape     Absolutely, absolutely. I wouldn   t trade my upbringing for anything. It  really gave me a solid foundation about character and about great  expectations as an individual, as a human being. I don   t know, I never  thought about prejudice. None of that never entered my mind or my  thoughts. I just thought people were people, and we were all placed on  this earth for a purpose. So, I don   t know, I just   happy. Like I said, we  9  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  were very poor and didn   t realize it until I look back now and I can  realize the things that really were taking place, but we were happy. We  were very happy.  What was the junior high you attended?  I went to Carver. It was here in Tulsa, also with the Tulsa Public Schools  and had nice memories of Carver.  And then for high school?  High school went to Booker T. Booker T. Washington and tried out for  majorette and made it. I was a majorette, and so that was a funny  experience, like I said, coming from a strict background to be able to do  that. My mom had a lot to do with that. With my dad traveling, I   m not  even aware that he knew what was going on during that time. (Laughs) I  really don   t know.  That   s probably a good thing.  I think it was a really good thing because he had a straight and narrow   path . Mom was a little more  relaxed ,    Kids need to experience  playing ball and doing different things.    And I also remember one time  she let my oldest sister have a party. But it really wasn   t the kind of  party that people have now, but Dad just didn   t understand that, but  Mom allowed   she said,    These kids need to learn how to socialize with  other kids and enjoy  that they   re kids.    And so, he kind of let it happen.  It was little simple things like cake and hot dogs and maybe jumping  around or something. So, I remember that, too. (Laughs)  Were they very supportive of your education?  Yes, they really were, my mom especially. My mom was kind of   I  guess she was just the heartbeat of everything. My dad was a little  more   he was a little more, just one way, that it was one way. But Mom  was   she knew that education was the key, and she knew that reading  and disciplining yourself to study was the answer and a way of having a  better life. She really did. Dad, he didn   t talk very much on education.  He was more the spiritual. There   s a balance. There   s always a balance,  but he was more of your spiritual aspect of things and getting your life  lined up with the things and the principles of what God had placed for  man to do. But Mom, she knew that school was real important. We went  to school. We did not miss school, and so she was right on that, that  education is the way.  So, how   d you get to Langston? Why Langston?  10  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Well, Langston is a family tradition. I have an aunt who taught school,  and they all went to Langston. Everybody in my family went to  Langston or they   ll go to Langston. I have a nephew now, he   s at  Langston. So, Langston has just been our family tradition, that no matter  what, you have to go to Langston. Now, one of my sisters went to OSU,  but she came back to Langston. So, Langston is just it. You have to go to  Langston if you   re a part of our family. (Laughter)  Well, tell me about Langston back then.  Wow, back then, Langston. Man. Wow. Langston was just almost like  the wilderness, really. I mean, really the wilderness. There are so many  wonderful improvements now, but when I went to Langston it was  definitely like the wilderness. The buildings that they have constructed  now were definitely not there. You had   Sanford Hall is where I stayed  and just wilderness is the best way to describe it. (Laughs) We would  say,    If you can survive Langston, you can survive anywhere.    But it  was a wonderful experience.  I met some wonderful people there, and I was very focused. I was very  focused, I paid my own way. I worked that summer and I didn   t go the  first semester, but I went the second semester. I had saved up money and  I worked. And when I got there, I was able to get work study. And I  always worked, it was just the ethics that    You have to pay your own  way, you have to work.    It   s   nothing is given to you. No free rides, and  that   s kind of from my dad, too. That you have to work, and so Langston  was a great experience for me, but it was kind of like the wilderness. I  remember many hungry nights at Langston, and that was during the time  when I said I didn   t like Spam   I guess I   m going off   but I was so  hungry one night that Spam was pretty good. It was pretty good. So, I  have wonderful memories of Langston, but it was pretty in the  wilderness just     A lot different than Tulsa.  Yes, a lot different than Tulsa. Yes, a lot different, but I had a made-up  mind and I knew what I wanted. I knew what my major was and I was  determined that I was going to graduate and make an impact on the life  of people. Children, mainly, I loved children.  But before you went to Langston, where did you work?  Okay, yes, that   s a neat thing to share. I worked at The Oklahoma Eagle.  It   s one of the first and only black newspapers in Oklahoma. I worked  there and then I got a promotion. I went from there to the Tulsa  11  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  courthouse as a small claims adjuster. So, I worked there at Tulsa  County, small claims, and then I went to school.  And then when you were at Langston, where was your work study?  My work study was within the physical education department with one  of the coaches. I did a lot of filing and typing and work like that.  You   re studying. Did you have any time for fun at Langston?  I did. Oh, I did. (Laughter) Now, I   ve got to mention that it was the  wilderness, but I   m telling you, they had some really   I wasn   t like a  party animal or anything like that, the drinking, I never did anything like  that. From the background of our home, that was just something that you  didn   t participate in because you really   your parents just instilled in  you that your body was a temple. Health and doing the right thing with  your body was very important, so I just kept that all of my college life  and adult life. So, I wasn   t in the party scene, but I would have fun, like  at football games and volleyball and basketball, things like that. I made  my own fun. Things like that without the crazy party scene. But it was  going on, but I didn   t really get caught up in a lot of the party, partying,  and drinking.  During that time, drugs was not on the scene real big like it is, I just  didn   t. And the people that   it was important too, for me, the people  that I connected with, the people that I associated with, their morals and   they knew  what they were there for. So, I really didn   t have time to  just get into a lot of mischief and parties and all of that because I was   focused . I knew how hard it was for my parents and for me also,  because I had to work. I had to work.  But your mind was on that goal.  Absolutely  on my goal .  And you got your degree in what year?  I got my degree in    75.  So, you   re fresh out of Langston. You   re ready to make an impact on the  world     Yes, oh yes. Absolutely.  Where do you go?  12  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Well, the first thing that I decided, obviously of course I wanted to be an  educator. I wanted to teach school. I had been inspired by the teacher  who made me feel like you can aim for the moon and fall amongst the  stars, and so my mind was set. I wasn   t wavering,    What am I going to  do?    I wanted to be an educator, and so what I did, I got with someone  to help with a little resume and the outline and those things and had my  first interview. I really prepared for it, I tell you. I   ll never forget, it was  with Dr. Joann Bell, and I had everything all set up and had some  samples of some work that I had did at Langston in the education  department, some lesson plan templates and some little things that I had  made up. So, I had all of that, and so when I went in I was really  prepared and really sold myself that I could do an excellent job. So, I  remember when I left out  of the interview  the lady who I later on  became a friend with said,    After your interview,    the lady walked out,  Dr. Bell said,    I don   t need to interview anyone else. I have my  candidate.     So, my first year was at Cooper Elementary School with Dr. Joann Bell,  and it was really exciting to have my  first class . You always love that  first class. Oh, my goodness  So, I can remember spending countless  hours at school and working with other teachers and working with kids  and parents and just loving it. Oh, boy  I tell you, I did my first play  there at Cooper with my students. We wrote and directed a play, and I  took pieces of it from The Wizard of Oz, which I mentioned Dorothy  earlier. I loved that reading and that play, but I changed it, and I changed  it to the positive word and the negative word. I had it all changed, and  the kids loved it. We worked on our scenery. We worked on our little  costumes, with the help of some parents, and did my first play and  invited parents, and it was a huge success. The kids were absolutely  phenomenal with that play, so lots of great memories of my years as an  educator. Love it. Love it.  What grade did you teach?  I had first grade. I   ve taught first, I   ve taught second, I   ve taught third,  and I even did a middle school. (Laughs) I really got back to elementary  school, but I just love it. Love education, love being an educator. Never  looked at the money because it   s not there, but just loved it with a  passion  I remember, I mentioned that I moved to Texas, and they do the  evaluations where they bring someone in from outside of your school  and another person to evaluate you. I remember one of the comments  that the evaluator made, he said,    This woman has a passion for  education. She loves what she does,    and I do. I feel like I move and live  and breathe when I see children, the light bulb comes on that,    Hey, this  is not so bad. Reading is not so bad after all. Math is not so bad after  all.    Those type of things, and seeing a student who struggles and then  13  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  see all of the sudden, they   re excited about learning and they have a  passion to want to learn, so that   s one of the   a teacher   s best memories,  seeing her students excel.  Well, you   re at Cooper. What are some of the other schools?  Okay, I went   from Cooper I went to Eliot, and I was the first African  American teacher at Eliot. That was quite interesting my first year, loved  it. I remember back-to-school night, parents were very involved. I think  I had three medical doctors    children in my class and maybe two  attorneys and these were people before they sent their kids to Cascia  Hall and Monte Cassino. Eliot was one of those schools in Tulsa that I  had some of the best test scores and best parent participation and best  teachers, best educators. So, I was honored to be selected. I remember  Ms. Collier called me in and she said,    There is an opening at Eliot, and  I want you there. I think you will be successful and also you will make  this bridge that we   re trying to cross be successful.    I had a wonderful  time at Eliot.  It was so funny. My first year, they had so many questions for me about  curriculum and just really trying to see where I was. And the next year,  they were writing letters to have their students in my classroom,  knocking on the principal   s door, because of the hands-on things and the  cutting edge things that I would do with students, just not paper and  pencil all the time. I was doing brain-body things and didn   t know it at  the time, didn   t know that label, didn   t know that small group instruction  and one-on-one and children working as a community to think their  things through and that strength that you can have building a class  community, and so really wonderful memories at Eliot.  Then, after Eliot, I moved to Texas, went to Dallas, Texas and taught  there for three years in North Dallas and really loved it, did plays again.  I did a lot of plays because I realized that even with curriculum, how you  can pull in with kids writing plays and acting out plays. We did our math  and other things, but there was a lot of strength in being able to write  things and to role play and to act, so that was a real key component that I  always had in my curriculum, to build around writing and the reading  and reciting and being able to project and stand up before an audience  and a crowd, and so, real exciting. Then I came back to Tulsa, came  back to Oklahoma. (Laughs)  And you   re back in Oklahoma at that point     Back in Oklahoma.  Where do you end up?  14  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Where am I now?  Yes.  I   m back with Tulsa Public Schools. Have done some really crazy  things, I tell you  You   ll have people say,    She   s so great as a teacher,  she   s phenomenal. I bet she   ll be a great administrator. Let   s see what  we can do with her as a principal.    So, I had gone back to school. I   d  gotten my reading degree, got my master   s in reading, then went back  and worked on a plus thirty in administration and just took that dive into  administration. Oh, my goodness, my goodness  I wasn   t very successful  with it because I still had   I mean, it was just   I guess the personality  and my mindset and my thinking just didn   t gel. But the great thing  about it is when you can realize that you are a fish out of water and what  you are really called to and called for. I began to realize that I was called  to teach. I was called. I was not called to be a principal. It sounded good  and a lot of my friends were going into administration, and    Yes, I think  I can do that. I think I could make a difference,    but oh my. Wow   So, I   m back teaching. I   m back in my pond where I should be, and I  love it. I   m making an impact on a life of children that cannot be erased,  and I know it. I know it. It   s like different as night and day, from  administration to teaching. There are some people who are wonderful in  administration, bless their hearts, and they do an absolute phenomenal  job. You have to realize as an educator, what they did, they took an  absolutely wonderful educator, a teacher, and put her in a position, and  that happens so much. Someone says,    Oh, she   s a great teacher, she   ll  be a great principal,    but you move this person and you lose a great  teacher, and you have them in a position where they really shouldn   t be.  So, I realized that teaching is where I should be, educating children for  the twenty-first century.  So, you   re happy to be back in the classroom.  I am so happy to be back in the classroom. I really am. I did three  assignments as an administrator. I did an assistant principal position, I  did an interim position and the interim position was pretty good. I really  liked that, but I tell you, it   s a different world. It   s a different world. I   m  so glad to be back in the classroom where I was destined to be.  And what grade are you teaching?  I have third grade.  Third grade? At what school?  15  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  I   m at McClure Elementary School. I love it, love it. I have some  interesting little ones that come to me every day. Like I said, I   m making  a mark that won   t be erased in their life, and it   s exciting. It   s exciting  that I can apply those same principles that I received. I   m old school. I   ll  tell some of the little boys that I have,    I   m just old school.    I tell you  what, I   m glad I have the experience, nothing teaches you better than  experience. I   m glad I had the experience in administration. I learned a  lot. I definitely learned that I was out of my place and should be back in  the classroom, and I   m just glad to be back as an educator.  Well, now you can just check that off your list.  Absolutely, absolutely, a big check. But you know what I think about so  often, is that when you realize   a lot of times people will be in a  position or a spot, and it   s not where they should be. I don   t know if it   s  pride, I don   t know if it   s,    Oh, I   ve been here so long, I might as well  just ride it out,    or what, but when you can come to realize that,    This is  not what I was created for. This is not my place. This is not my purpose,  but this is where I should be.    Not worrying about,    What are the people  going to think, what are they going to say? Oh, wow, I   m losing x-amount  of dollars.    What does it really matter when you   re not at peace?  When you   re not fulfilling your purpose? And that   s where my dad  comes in, letting us know that we were put here on this earth for a  purpose.  Well, at some point you started a family.  Yes. Oh, yes.  Why don   t you tell me about that?  I   ll tell you about that. I met a wonderful man,  Theo  Brown. We   ve  been married for forty years, and we met in Tulsa. I used to see him and  I would never be with my friends, and I would always tell them about  this good looking tall guy. I don   t think they believed me because they  would never see him. I would always see him, and I would be by myself.  I would tell my friends, my girlfriends,    Oh, there   s this guy, he   s so  handsome,    and I   d go on and on and on. So, finally, he and I met   very  nice guy, very respectful. And he told me this, that he saw me years ago  playing ball, he said,    That   s going to be my wife.     So, the rest is history. We have a wonderful family, we have three sons,  and we have a daughter. They   ve all gone to Langston. (Laughs) So,  we   ve kept that tradition going, but my husband is very supportive, just  an excellent man. We have really weathered the storms of life that most  16  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  people do, but we   re still standing, we   re still together. We are funny  now because we are up in age and stuff, and as I said, we just celebrated  our fortieth wedding anniversary. I don   t think he   d trade me for  anything, and I certainly wouldn   t trade him for anything. He   s really  just a delightful man, and he   s the love of my life.  Well, that   s a long time to be married, forty years.  Yes it is, forty years.  Any secrets?  Not that I want to reveal in this interview. (Laughter)  Fair enough. So, you raised your family, you were teaching. You have  quite an active life outside of school     Absolutely.     and I   d like you to share a little bit with me.  Absolutely. Okay, I   d love to share on this. I   m going to reflect back  upon my mom again, the things that she instilled in us as we were  coming up as far as your fellow man, serving, helping those that needed  a helping hand. I would drive down Denver, and I would see women  who were homeless, and it would just   my heart would just go,    Where  do they go at night?    and I would be concerned that they were being  abused or hurt. So, every time, I   d see a woman and I   d want to take her  and help her and take her home or just feed her or whatever. So, I started  with a group of ladies at my church, reaching out to women who were  incarcerated, and it was just a small thing at this time, just going and  sharing with them. Not even trying to find out why were they in prison  or   but just going and letting them know that there   s still hope. No  matter what your situation is, where you are, you are valuable.  So, we kind of started with that message, and it was kind of funny. We  started with letting them know that they were queens, and so it was so  funny, we would say,    You are still a queen, no matter where your  throne is, you are queen. It   s what you think and how you see yourself  and what you say about yourself,    and so we started doing things,  affirmations. Getting, finding things that we could have in written form  where they could make affirmations about themselves and it was really  strange. We would do things where they would take a mirror and some  of them would have a hard time looking in the mirror saying,    I am  somebody,    because of their situation. But then as we worked with  them, they began to just say positive things about their life.    I will not  17  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  always be in prison. I will have my children back. I will have a different  mindset.     So, one thing just led to another where our group got bigger, where  women really wanted to go out and visit the ladies that were in prison.  So, my husband and I had real estate in North Tulsa, and we didn   t know  at the time what we wanted to do with it. He and I had been told that we  would do a ministry together, and somehow when people hear that, they  think   they get it all pretty, I won   t say twisted, but they think ministry,  the four walls of the church and doing   but to us, my husband and I,  ministry is outside the four walls. So, we have this house, and we were  trying to decide what we wanted to do with the home. It was during the  time when the Katrina incident and situation happened and we said,  Well, some of the people had come to Tulsa and we said,    Well, maybe  we can open up the house and help some of the families that have been  displaced,    but that didn   t gel, that didn   t happen.  So, what we decided we would do, we   d get the house ready and when  women were released from prison, they could have a place to come until  they could get on their feet and get their own apartments or get their  lives back, and so that happened. I was traveling to Dallas, and I   m very  verbal and friendly, and I   ll just strike up a conversation. It so happened  on my trip to Dallas, there were two ladies that were   they worked with  remodeling homes and   sharp ladies, they do things on Brookside. So,  we got to talking. But we started out our conversation with mentors for  children, so I kind of have a twofold thing. I want kids to have people to  inspire them as mentors, and when she gave me her card, I saw that she  was remodeling and so I said,    Wow  I am looking      I began to share  my vision about the house and the women and sure enough, they came  to the home, we met, and one thing just led to the other.  They began to send people who could come and help lay the floor and  just remodel and do the house. I mean, people came from all over Tulsa  helping with getting this house ready for women that were incarcerated,  needing a place to stay. People like Brad from Mathis Brothers said,     Once you get it, we   d like to donate furniture,    and Habitat for  Humanities. I mean, one word, it just opened up. People began to come  in and help and we were able to open the home. We   ve had seven  women, totally, that have come through the home until they could get on  their feet, and so we were able to be a blessing to those women.  That   s quite inspirational, that     I love it, I tell you.  You don   t know what to do with it, and then     18  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  And I mean, just out of   another thing, too, they did an article in the  Oklahoma Woman Magazine. When people read things, they,    Hey,  what can we do? How can we find this lady? We want to be a part of  making a difference in the life of someone who just ran upon hard  times.    And then I began to do a lot of research about prison and women  in Oklahoma, and it is really unbelievable how Oklahoma has the  highest imprisonment rate for women. And then some of the things  women are imprisoned for, the time that they are given in Oklahoma is  just unbelievable.  So, I just love the community, love just getting out. I will sometimes  find myself just getting out feeding people. Reasor   s grocery store, they  have been such a blessing to me and my ministry as far as giving bakery  goods and items like that. They have a missions department and  normally if I go by, they are so helpful in giving me things. I go out to  the projects and encourage children to read, encourage children to     giving out cookies and doughnuts and stuff like that. I   ve been known to  do that, and so just love it. It   s the heartbeat for me to just get out and  serve people, serve my community.  And you   ve done your fair share of tutoring after hours?  Oh, yes, I   ve done that too, absolutely. During summer hours, you just  don   t turn it off. You go out there. The Rudisill Library, I   m quite  known for tutoring. I   ve also developed my own reading program called  Totally Chloe, and it   s a musical component with little raps and little  tongue twisters, and so I developed that. I go to Texas and different  places and present to teachers and inspire them to just really give 100  percent in education.  At what point did you feel called to start a ministry?  I think it was during the time   I mean, you want years, or   ?  No, just in general     During the time when I would drive down Denver, and I remember my  pastor saying things like,    When you see something and you want to  change or you feel a passion for it, maybe that   s what God is calling you  to do.    And I always would, I would see women and just wonder,     Where are they going? Where do they live? Do they have a place?     Which they didn   t have a place. And I always wanted them to be safe  and for them to feel loved and you could see the hurt on many of their  faces. I just wanted to take them and   I would always say this,    That   s  somebody   s child. That   s somebody   s   she was a little girl or he was a  19  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  little boy.    So, I always would just feel something in my heart for the  people there and wanted them to be taken care of. So, I think that   s when  it first entered my heart and my mind. Knowing my mom, after  something like that, you would want to go and be educated in that area.  So, I went to school, as far as the ministry, where I would know the right  things that you do and how you decide to   the whole thing, hospital  visits, nursing home, funeral home, all those type things, prison  outreach, and so I graduated in that and became a minister. So, I   m quite  busy. (Laughter)  It   s kind of like teaching, too. It   s right there.  Absolutely. It really is. It   s a good combination, being an educator and  being in ministry, it   s the same. You   re teaching. You   re inspiring. To  teach is to be called out. You are wanting a better life. You want people  to see that there is a sunrise, there is a rainbow, there is a better way.  There is hope. Nothing is hopeless. You   re not hopeless. There is a way.  I know I   m probably sounding very   but what   s wrong with being very  optimistic? What   s wrong with aiming for the moon, and what   s wrong  with always being positive that it can work, it can happen? What   s  wrong with that? Nothing.  Well, we learn the background we need for our careers in many different  places, not always in school, but sometimes. Where are some of the  places that you feel you   ve learned the background for your career?  Well, definitely I   ll have to say church. Definitely have to say that. And  then home, in my home with my parents and everything and stuff. Just  definitely that, church and home, very strong, even in our community  now in North Tulsa, or Tulsa all over. We   re very strong in our  churches. They say we   re the Bible belt, and so it   s pretty true. So,  definitely just in our church, our community, and home.  Any stumbling blocks you faced along the way?  Oh, wow, yes. We all have some stumbling blocks, but there   s a song  that says,    We fall down, but we get up,    and that   s the most important  thing is not how you fall or when you fall, but what do you do after the  fall. What do you do? Do you just lay down and it   s all over, or do you  get up? I   ve mentioned about the administration. That was a hard hit.  That was a hard fall, but do you just say,    I   ve failed. I   m a failure.    It   s  not even in my vocabulary. Do you say,    Hey, I tried it. It didn   t work,  but this works better for me,    and keep moving? Do you keep, what  attitude do you have? Do you still have a smile on your face?  I had a couple of principal friends who came by, I think it was back-to-  20  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  school night, they were in the area and came by to see my classroom.  The great thing about that is I know what principals look for and what  should be in a classroom, and I just had a smile and a wonderful attitude  and just,    Hey, this is it for me, and I wish you well.    So, when you have  those stumbling blocks, what do you do? When you get a lemon, what  do you do? Do you make lemonade with it or what do you say? We   ve  all had stumbling blocks. What do you learn from it? What   s the  experience? How can you help someone else with what you   ve stumbled   over ? How can you be that light, that torch, that bridge for someone  who   s stumbled? We   ve all stumbled, all of us, but what do you do when  you fall? What do you do when you skin your knees? Do you just lay  there? Do you get up and dust yourself off and say,    I can make it, I can  do it, I can make it.     So, I   ve had lots of stumbling blocks, I have. It hasn   t always been roses,  but again, from that background from my mom and my dad, you learn to  be an overcomer. You learn to trust and say,    Hey, there   s a bright side,     or you learn to say,    Hey, I missed it. I thought that I could make a  difference or I thought that this would be a good turn in my life or my  career, but it wasn   t,    and so I turned from that and turned another way  and go forward.  Well, as a long time educator, minister, community leader, looking back  on what you   ve done so far, any highlights that you just really take to  heart that you really say,    Wow    ?  Well, being inducted into the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame   is that  the right answer? (Laughter) I   m sure it is, is a highlight. And I must say  this, my mom just passed in October, but she was with me during the  induction, and that was a highlight. What I did, I gave the award to my  mom, and I was able to do that. I thought as I had to make this little  speech and what would I say and what really came to my mind was my  mom   s mission statement. Even though she didn   t know it was a mission  statement. We all  have a  mission statement, but every organization,  every ministry that I have connected with underlined my mom   s mission  statement.  I   ve volunteered with Catholic Charities. I   ve been at Day Springs where  abused women, I just have a heart for that, but I think about each of their  mission statements to serve, committed to serve, that was my mom. That  was her. As I said, it wasn   t a mission statement, written up, typed up,  but it was just what she would want us to do, to treat people the way you  want to be treated. If you have a piece of bread and someone   s hungry,  share that bread with the person who   s hungry. So, that was the  highlight, accepting the recognition as Oklahoma Women   s Hall of  Fame, but looking out and seeing my mom. Some of the ladies from our  21  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  church came, too, and I realized that even though I   m being honored,  there are so many people on the side of me, behind me, in front of me,  that made this all possible. Who would have dreamt a little girl from  Greenwood would be receiving an honor of Oklahoma Women   s Hall of  Fame? It was just more than I could even imagine.  But to actually have my mom out in the audience and then to have her  stand and say,    Mom, you are the Oklahoma Hall of Famer, and I  receive this in your honor.    And that was another thing that we were  taught. I said honor, and this is the 2012 year, and Exodus 20:12 says     Honor your mother and father,    and not just honor your mother and  father, but honor your word, honor people. Hurting people, people  that   honor. And we have gotten away from that, and so when I  received that honor, I knew that it just wasn   t Chloe Brown, but it was  all the women that were incarcerated, all the women who walk the  streets in Tulsa, all the women that trusted me as a friend and their  mentor in this ministry, to follow me, to say,    We want to do this, we  want to make a difference in the life.    So, the honor was for all of them.  Do you remember who presented you at the ceremony?  I do. I absolutely do. It was my daughter, and what an honor to have  your daughter see the work that her mom is doing and to have that  legacy that,    Hey, my mom is a woman who loves the community,  who   first of all, my mom is a woman who loves God.    Because if you  don   t love Him, how can you love your fellow man? So, that   s the key  thing. And to have my daughter   and her little speech was so precious.  Out of all the things that were said, the words that she said were more  valuable because they came from someone who sees you behind the  scene. It   s like we all have a face, we have our face that we wear to  church, we have our face at work, we have   but for your children to see  you at home behind the scene and know that,    That   s the same mom that  I see at church, I see in the marketplace,    that   s more valuable than  anything.  You kind of touched upon this, but what does this type of honor mean to  you?  Wow, let   s see. It   s nice to   somebody said,    It   s nice to be important,  but it   s important to be nice.    It   s nice that someone would recognize  what you   re doing. You don   t wave a banner. You don   t get on top of  the mountain and shout    I   m doing this     But when someone else sees  what you   re doing from your heart, because what comes from the heart,  really comes from the heart, it reaches the heart. You don   t have to wave  a flag or shoot up a flare. Just do it from your heart. So, this was really  nice that somebody said,    Hey, here   s a woman after God   s own heart.  22  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Here   s a woman after the heart of the community. Here   s a woman that  gives 100 percent.     Getting out there on the streets, in the prison takes time. Even your  words, saying,    You can do this. Think this way,    that takes a lot of  energy. It does, and time, but for someone to say,    Hey, this is  noteworthy that this woman would sacrifice her time, her efforts, and do  it.    You don   t get paid. There   s not a spotlight at all. Some mornings,  when I would pick up the food and the things, it would be cold, but I  always thought that somebody is hungry. Somebody needs this, and I  strategically plan it right when I know that they   re low on their food  stamps or don   t have them at all.  I have certain places I go and take the food and things to. Just the  women that are incarcerated, just having someone to come and visit,  having someone,    Will you write a letter for me?    I   ve been asked so  many times to write letters, and I   ve encountered those that can   t read,  and just to be a resource to help, so very exciting and that somebody  would say,    Hey, this is the Oklahoma spirit. This is what Oklahoma   s  all about. O-K-homa.     Well, I think this question comes up a lot because you are a teacher and  you have direct impact, direct contact with students every day.  Yes, I love it, every day.  How do you feel that students and people in the community and people  that you see, that you interact with through your outreach efforts, look at  you as a role model?  When you hear    role model      and I   m always so happy to hear when  children are asked that, and they say their parents, or they say a teacher.  They don   t say Michael Jordan or LeBron James, but they   ll say,    My  dad,       My mom,       My teacher.    Oh, what an impact that teachers make  on the lives of children. It   s like,    I want to be like my teacher. I want  to       Those type things are so heartfelt that you can be a role model for  students and you can make a difference in their lives. So, I think when  people see Mrs. Brown   and sometimes they   ll say Mrs. Chloe Brown,  not my direct students, but just the ladies that I go with, or they   ll say  Queen Chloe, just to have someone say that,    I want to be   I know I  can   t be you, but just the way you say things and the way I feel you love  me or you care.     They don   t just come out and say,    You   re my role model,    but that   s  where they   re going, what they are saying, so especially the little girls.  Always, when I   m in my classroom, I want to make sure my  23  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  presentation, presentation is everything. I want to make sure I   m  presentable, even with what I have on. It   s just the standard that I present  myself that way to the kids, to the students that are in my room, the  things that I say and how I say it. I   ve always learned this, that the  volume of your voice, how you speak and your tone, and in my career,  I   ve been at this for forty years, I can honestly sit here and say I   ve  never yelled at a student.  I took this is as the frame, being large in size, when I talk to them even  in a corrective way, I   ll use sort of a really low whispered voice, and  they   re like, especially the kids now, they   re like   (gestures), and the  other kids are looking to see,    What is she going to say?    But it   s always  direct, focused eyes and very quiet at what I   m saying and make them  think about their thinking, from the simplest thing. So, I just want to  definitely be a role model for my students. When they leave my room     and I always tell them, this is the funniest thing. I   ll say,    Do you know  they put the smartest kids in my class? And you   ll never have a teacher  as brilliant, as loving, as Mrs. Brown?    And so that is always so funny,  they   re like,    They put the smartest kids in her room. She   s a brilliant  teacher.    (Whispers) So, I enjoy it. I have so much fun with my students,  I really do.  Well, you have been going at this for a while. Do you ever hear back  from former students?  I do. I   m glad you asked me that  I do. I just celebrated my sixtieth  birthday, and there   s a student   I have kept up with three of my former  students throughout their   they were with me for second grade, and now  they   re graduating from college. Well, one has graduated. He   s getting  ready to take the bar exam, Bradley Brown. We are so close. He came to  my sixtieth birthday and he   I had a letter, I keep everything. Teachers,  we just keep everything, and I knew he was coming, and so I found a  letter that he had written to me. And at my sixtieth birthday party, I read  the letter. He came. He   s such a handsome young man. He   s going to be  an attorney. He   s finishing up, Bradley Brown, and he   s getting married,  and so he sent me an invitation, and we keep in touch. And then Andy  Hartman, who   s an attorney here, Sally Hartman, his daughter.  So, I keep in touch with them. I   ll see them at the marketplace  somewhere, and they   ll,    Mrs. Brown, you still look the same. You  haven   t changed.    And one of my things Bradley shared with my party  guests, I always had things that would I say,    Welcome to success, I   ll  see you at the top.    And he said to my guests,    The first thing, I   ll never  forget what you said to me, Mrs. Brown, you said,    Welcome to  success.    Out of all my teachers, I have always remembered those were  the first words that came out of your mouth,    Welcome to success.        24  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  And so, at my birthday party, he said,    Mrs. Brown, welcome to  success.    (Laughter) So, you   ll be hearing about Bradley Brown. He   s  getting ready to be a wonderful attorney.  That   s great.  And oh, let me share this. I was at church two weeks ago and one of my  former students   you   ve heard about Bradley   one of my former  students, a little girl   and you just get where you want your kids in your  classroom to achieve and do their best   she came, she had saw me in  the newspaper. She had read an article about my outreach for women in  prison, and she saw that and she wanted to get in touch with me because  she had gone to prison. So, last Sunday, two weeks ago, she came to my  church, and I was at the door. As she was leaving out, she came up to  me, she said,    Mrs. Brown.    And you have so many that you forgot, and  she told me who she was, and we began to talk.  I took her alongside and sat down and she shared with me what had gone  on in her life. She said,    If I had only listened to you, you were my first  introduction to doing the right thing,    and so I   m going to be mentoring  her. She wants to go with me, go back to the prison. She   s been in prison  twice, she   s out now, and so I want to mentor her. I want to help her.  She   s got four boys and that   s going to be my goal that I work with her.  We helped her during the Christmas holiday break, and I   m just looking  forward to taking her with me into the system so she can share firsthand  about her experience. So, you have those that are successful and then  you have those that had some bumps in the road, but I believe with all  my heart that she   s back with me for a reason, so we   re going to see  what we can do together.  Well, I   m glad you brought up mentoring because you   ve mentioned it  several times during our interview today. Could you talk a little bit  about the importance of mentoring?  Absolutely, absolutely. Many children in this twenty-first century,  today   s children, are from single parent homes and working homes,  moms who work. Even it   s homes where there   s a dad and a mom,  sometimes the dads are just so busy. So, I feel that to get a mentor and a  student together is just a vital experience for those children. Sometimes  even just having someone who will come and listen to them read or read  with them or come and have lunch with them, just someone that can be  that extra person in their life that really inspires them that they can  achieve anything, do anything, and spend that time with them. See,  that   s the quality, the time. Children are looking for someone to just  listen to them. To spend that time with them, so mentoring, I think, is a  vital, vital part of a child   s life, whether they   re from a single home or if  25  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  there are two parents in the home that, to have someone. We, at  McClure, we have an excellent mentor program that   s been very  successful. You want to match up children and mentors together and  have a successful, safe situation, and we   re seeing that.  I just think it   s a really great thing to have that program in place, and I  really think it   s vital for middle school students to have a mentor. If you  can get a really good mentor program in our middle schools, I think that  would really help with a lot of gang violence and drugs. I   ve heard  young men come back and give their testimonies that they were from a  single household  and  what a difference a mentor made. And Father   s  Day, that   s who they send the Father   s Day card to. That   s who they call  is that mentor. I mean, they just light up. The little guy that   s in my  room, the little boy that has a mentor, he comes on Friday. I   m telling  you, when that mentor steps in that door, that child just lights up. It just  makes a difference in his little life that someone would come and he  could go and just talk with or play a game with or read with. Just  someone that can be inspirational and be instrumental in their lives. I tell  you, our mentor programs are wonderful, and I   m just so grateful that  people would take the time to be a mentor. I salute them. They are so  vital. They are the heartbeat in our school system.  Well, you spoke a lot about your parents, but would you like to make  mention of anybody who   s played an important role in your life?  I would. I   d like to make mention of one of my teachers, one of the  educators in my life, Joann Gilford, and she   s still in my life. She is such  an inspiration and such a fine person. We have laughed about me being  in administration. She was a former principal, and so she knows all the  funny things that can take place, but just a wonderful role model. She  just loves children and such a good reading specialist. And I   m telling  you, she will correct you. Sometimes she and I   I   m doing better. She   s  the type, when we were coming up, if you were splitting a verb or saying  something wrong, you   d get an English lesson right there. She wouldn   t  let you slide with anything.  So, she would help me with writing assignments and speaking. And  sometimes we   d be talking and all of the sudden, she   d say,    Nope,  you   re not to say that. This is how you say it,    so you get where you   re  like,    Okay, do I carry on a conversation, or do I just sit here silently?     (Laughs) So, yes, Joann Gilford. She is still working with children.  Right now, she is teaching reading to Hispanic adults, and so she loves  what she does. She is almost eighty-years-old now. Yes. Still working in  school as a volunteer and a mentor. So, yes, Joann Gilford.  If you could give advice to your fellow Oklahomans, what would you tell  26  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  them?  Wow. Let   s see. Always be true to yourself and true to others. Love  yourself. Love others. Work hard because working hard always pays off.  Be true to your word, be fair, be a good listener, be compassionate.  Always go the extra mile. Never give up. Always believe in yourself.  Believe in others. Be very thoughtful of what you say and how you say it  about yourself because sometimes we say things about ourselves, the  negative things about ourselves. So, I would just say be mindful of what  you say and what you do and how you do it. And take time, take time for  yourself. Look who   s talking. I   m talking to myself because we can get  so busy that we forget to stop and smell the flowers. So, take time for  yourself. Be true to yourself. Be true to others. Every day you wake up,  say,    Today is going to be a great day, it   s going to be the best day  ever,    and make it happen.  Any words of wisdom for people who   d like to follow in your footsteps?  Wow, let   s see. Definitely, yes. One thing I   d like to say is acknowledge  God in all your ways. Put Him first place. Trust Him, depend on Him,  and just follow His lead and His direction. And again, just treat people  the way you want to be treated and let love always be your guiding  vehicle.  We kind of started out the interview talking about Oklahoma. I can tell  you   re very passionate about the state.  Absolutely.  What does Oklahoma mean to you?  Well, Oklahoma, as I said earlier, it   s just the foundation of my whole  being because it   s all I know. It   s all I know is Oklahoma. In the word  Oklahoma is Home. It   s home. It   s OK, it   s an OK place to live, and I  love Oklahoma. As I said earlier, I lived in Texas for three years, but I  found myself coming back to the land of Oklahoma where I just feel  opportunities have been great here for me. I can remember one of my  sons saying,    Makes no difference where you go, it   s the best state I  know. Oklahoma, Oklahoma, you   re OK.     What   s next on the agenda?  Well, next on the agenda is  loving  my grandchildren. We didn   t talk  about our grandchildren, and I saw a bumper sticker that said,    If I  would have known grandchildren were this great, I would have had them  first.    (Laughter) So, probably just visiting and loving on those little  27  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  grandchildren. I have one. His name is Jordan. He attends Tulsa schools,  and I have Brooklyn  and Blaire , and  I  just enjoying them. Then I  have others that we   ve adopted along the way and just taking some time,  my husband and I, enjoying our grandchildren.  No plans to retire anytime soon?  Well, you know, I   m up for retirement this coming December, but I   m  enjoying the ride, so I   m just trying to decide whether I want to just stay  in a little longer or if I want to retire. Why do they call it retire?  (Laughter) And just kind of see what directions I   ll take and where the  next adventure of Chloe Brown   s life will lead. I know I   ll be  somewhere doing something that will enhance the lives of Oklahomans.  And I take it family is still very important in your life today.  Yes, absolutely. Family is very important in our lives. Just to see our  children grow up and have their own individual lives. I have the three  sons, they   re all married and my daughter is still single. But they know  the value of family and they know the value of your place in the family  and their father being honored and their mother loving the community  and doing work in the community that is valuable, that has purpose. We  can get busy doing a lot of things and neglect our family, but it   s so  important that your family realize that their place with you is always  first place.  Sometimes I wonder,    Where do I get the time and the energy to do all  the things that I do?    But I know that it comes from above and it comes  from the honor, again, that I mentioned earlier, honor that you have for  God first, then your family, and then your church and your community.  So, I love my family and just like the closeness. We   re really a close  family. I have twin sons and they are really close. We say they have  their own little signals that they do when they want to talk  and   communicate with one another where no one else knows. So, just  closeness with the family is a goal, too, that I want to continue to have.  Family is so important. They   re always there when you need them.  Well, we   ve kind of taken a whirlwind tour through most of your life. Is  there anything else you   d like to add that we haven   t spoken about  today?  Not really. I think we   ve covered quite a bit with career and family and  just the love for God and love of service. I think we   ve covered quite a  bit. The funny part of being a principal and running back to the  classroom, and so quite a bit. But I do want to say to the other ladies  who have received this honor, I wish them Godspeed and each of them, I  28  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  Brown  Nykolaiszyn  said at the ceremony, and I listened to all the things that they had  accomplished and the things that they, too, had imported to their  communities, and I was at awe that,    Wow, women in Oklahoma are  doing so many wonderful things for our cities and for our state.    So, just  to have the honor of being surrounded with so many women of character  and excellence. I had an opportunity to visit with many of them and they  were so focused on their mission and what they were born to do and  born to give back to our state. So, I just salute the commission and the  things that women are doing. We are just so vital to our state and to the  world.  Well, you join a very impressive group of women.  Absolutely, I tell you, each of them in their own way were just women  of character and women of vision. It was just   actually, when we first  met, I actually sat back and said,    How in the world did I get even near  this?    This is absolutely astonishing to see the work that these women  have given their lives to do is just mind boggling. It is absolutely  phenomenal, the work that many of the women in Oklahoma are doing  and will do.  Well, one last question for you before we end. When history is written  about you, what would you like for it to say?  Wow. I would like for it to say,    This woman loved God and she loved  her fellow man.     Chloe Brown, thank you for joining us today.  It   s been my pleasure. It really has. Thank you for allowing me this  opportunity to share from my heart. Thank you.  Thank you.  -------  -------
