 Finchum Today is September 28, 2015. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with  Alex Bishop, and we   re with Oklahoma State University. Today we are  in Weatherford, Oklahoma, to speak with Beryl Jones.  Jones Cecil Beryl Jones.  Finchum Cecil Beryl, thank you for having us today.  Jones You   re welcome.  Finchum Let   s start with having you tell us when and where you were born.  Jones In Oklahoma, in another century. Of course I am too old or young to  remember when I was two or three years old because I   m a hundred and  one or two. I forget what I am now.  Finchum Born in 19     Jones Fourteen.  Finchum Nineteen fourteen and what month?  Jones September.  Finchum September. So what day?  Jones I don   t know.  Finchum This is September 28, have you already     Bishop Twenty-second.  5  Finchum Twenty-second. So you have already had your birthday this year.  Jones Yes, I have.  Bishop Says it right there, twenty-second.  Finchum Happy Birthday a little late. I   m a few days late. It was the twenty-second.  What town were you born in?  Jones It was the countryside.  Finchum Near what town?  Jones Hydro, Oklahoma.  Finchum Okay, so close to here. What did you father do for a living?  Jones Farmer.  Finchum And did your mother work?  Jones No. She was a housewife.  Finchum Did you have brothers and sisters?  Jones I had a brother but no sister.  Finchum Older or younger?  Jones What?  Finchum Your brother, was he older than you or younger?  Jones No, I was the oldest.  Finchum You grew up on a farm?  Jones Yes.  Finchum Did you have chores?  Jones Oh boy, yeah.  Finchum Like what?  6  Jones Like milking the cows and feeding the hogs. I don   t know, I think I  would   ve liked to have lived in town, but I lived in the countryside.  They say when I got to where I could walk, then I became paralyzed for  a while. Then, it just kind of miraculously went away. I can   t believe it  myself. (Laughs)  Finchum Well, in elementary school, where did you go?  Jones Hopewell.  Finchum Hopewell.  Jones Do you know where Hopewell is?  Finchum Huh-uh.  Jones It no longer exists. It was a country school about a mile, a little over a  mile that I had to walk or ride. I rode. My dad bought me a pony to ride  to school. That was fun. One day, there was a lot of the kids rode  horses. The older ones would ride together, and when my brother got  old enough to go, he sat, I don   t know, I guess he sat behind the saddle  and I was the driver. (Laughs) Going along there there   d be five or six  horse people with their buggies or riding horses. One day we were  going, one boy was a cowboy. He was bigger than I was. My brother  rode behind the saddle on that one horse to go, and as we went by this  bunch of people, one of the older ones pulled out a rope to play  cowboy. I ducked my head and it caught my brother around the neck  and jerked him off. (Laughs) That was kind of an exciting day, to say  the least. Another interesting   if you are interested in a little tidbit.  Finchum Sure.  Jones There was several of those boys and people that were older than I was.  During the marble season, there was quite a   all the boys played  marbles. We had a sandy place in Hydro, and it would be full of people  playing marbles. This group that would be coming from home, we   d  meet and talk and all on the way home. My brother, he was on the same  horse that I was. I think I was, well I   m sure I was up front and he was  behind the saddle. Well, there was this one cowboy, a lot older than we  were, and I was going to go around, and he pulled out a rope. He threw  that rope. I saw it coming and I ducked, and it caught my brother by the  neck. It was a wonder that it didn   t kill him, but it didn   t hurt him.  That same boy, when we started playing marbles, for keeps, on  Saturday at that sandy place, it would be crowded on Saturdays, people  playing marbles. He was older, he was a young man. I was just in third  7  grade, maybe. He wanted to play keeps with me, and I wouldn   t do it.  He just begged and begged and begged. The first time, well no, I just  refused to do it. He kept after me to do that. Oh, I didn   t know how to  play marbles very well when I started to school in the first grade. Here I  would have been in about the fourth grade. This older boy just kept  wanting me to play him a game of marbles. Finally I decided that   my  mother had bought me five little glass marbles. One of them got a chip  out of them so I said,    I   ll play you with that.    Now this was the second  attack that he had on me. Well, I took his marbles away from him.  (Laughs) I beat him. He wanted me to give them back, but I wouldn   t.  (Laughs)  Our schoolyard was planted in sunflowers. Just before school would  start, they   d have to cut those old sunflowers so we had a playground. I  guess that   s about it as for education. Now, go ahead. What do you  want?  Finchum Was that grades first through eighth?  Jones Yes.  Finchum One room?  Jones Well, they built two rooms. There wasn   t enough to   they used it more  or less for a storeroom. That worked out pretty good. We had a  windmill, so we had fresh water.  Finchum What would you do for lunch?  Jones Packed our lunch in a canister of some sort. That   s another story. We   d  go outside in good weather and set on a rock or a stone. Well, we took  our lunch in sacks and we   d set down and trade foods back and forth. If  someone had some good pie, we   d try to talk them out of it. (Laughs) I  didn   t have any extra very much. Then, when I graduated from grade  school at Hydro, I don   t know whether Hydro had a school bus or not,  but later on they did, built a little house on a truck for kids to ride to  school in. Then, later, we had some neighbors, when we got cars, his  dad would let him use his car, and then my dad did the same thing. We  exchanged back and forth. Both of us could ride on Daddy   s car. Then  the next time they   d drive the other man   s car. And I did get to ride in a  truck with a little house built on it when I got a little older.  Finchum Did you have a favorite subject?  Jones I think I always liked arithmetic. You want me to go ahead on the  education?  8  Finchum Sure.  Jones Well, I went to college after I had finished high school in    32.  Finchum You planned to go to college?  Jones No, I didn   t.  Finchum Were you involved with sports in high school?  Jones No, because I had to go so far and sports were taken after school, so I  didn   t think I should be in sports during high school.  Finchum So, when you graduated from high school, you went on to college?  Jones Yes. I didn   t want to, but my best friend wanted me to go and be his  buddy at Southwestern. I think we just had one bed for the two of us,  together in one bed, and we had to walk two or three hundred   not a  hundred, but a long way. We had to walk up the hill at Southwestern.  That   s where I went to school.  Finchum What did you major  in ?  Jones I liked math, and in high school I guess I was pretty good. The  superintendent wanted me to teach all the math in the first three periods.  I couldn   t do that. Jumping ahead, after I graduated, I went back to  Hydro. Again, this man, there were several things that he wanted to do  that I had never experienced much. I taught math in that high school,  this is part of the other thing I did that wasn   t so good. First thing he  wanted me to coach girls    basketball. I didn   t know much even about  basketball. The first game, all I could remember is that basketball take it  away if you could and keep it. Well that was a foul  I just fouled,  fouled, fouled. (Laughter) Then, later on he thought,    I want you to  teach math from the fourth grade on up.    That was a busy year. Then, I  guess it was in math. I taught math then from the fourth grade on  through high school. It was awful. Back then you didn   t say no to the  superintendent. (Laughs) He had me teaching math from the fourth  grade on through high school, and  coach  basketball. Those things are  ancient history. (Laughs)  Finchum Do you remember what your salary was those early days?  Jones I really don   t know. It seemed like quite a bit when I didn   t have any  money. (Laughs)  9  Finchum Well, did you teach school for your whole career?  Jones Yes. Well, it wasn   t all math. As a one-room school teacher you had to  teach a lot of things.  Finchum That   s true. So when you got through at Southwestern, you went back to  the country school?  Jones I went to the country school before the high school. Teaching fourth  grade through high school was a challenge. There was an occasion  where various schools competed with each other in their school work. I  taught math most of the way through school. The job of teaching math  from fourth grade through seniors was something I never want to go  through again. (Laughs) Now think, I   m in classes all day long, and you  think it   s going to be easy. (Laughter)  Finchum Well, did you serve in the military?  Jones Well, yeah, a little. I was lucky there. At this particular time of the war,  a man could take his wife to  base . The whole family went with him  and I got in on that. I kind of liked that.  Finchum Well, were you in World War II?  Jones Well, the end of it. I never went overseas. I had my wife and baby on  the base. I was in Dismissal, helping people get out of the service.  Finchum Where did you meet your wife?  Jones At church. We both lived close to the church. We went to church every  week.  Finchum When did you get married?  Jones When or where?  Finchum When, both?  Jones I don   t know.  Finchum How old were you?  Jones I can   t tell you for sure.  Finchum Had you already finished college?  10  Jones Well, at least started. I met her at church.  Finchum And you had how many children? How many children?  Jones Two, boy and a girl.  Finchum One of each.  Jones They   re both doing well.  Finchum Did you teach them in school?  Jones No, I don   t think so. I might have killed one of them if I had. (Laughter)  No, I didn   t teach them.  Bishop Did you say you were in the military?  Jones This last war that we were in, I was in the group where they dismissed  people from the service, in that part of it.  Bishop Did you ever get any recognition as a serviceman?  Jones No, I had a, I guess it was in the service. The thing I remember most  was when they started closing things down and they transferred people  away, there wasn   t much to do at all. I had two children with me and to  keep people earning their pay for a little while, they   d assign us to go to  the   well, what do they call the guys that drive around through the  place and check it out and kind of keep a record? I had to do that and  various jobs. One was transferring from Texas to New York, or  wherever they wanted to go.  And when it came by turn, they were dismissing soldiers so we had a  whole barrack full of people waiting to get released. One night, we   d  gone through our tour of checking. We got a notice to go back that there  was an Indian or Negro, I don   t know which, had run all the people out  of the barrack. I was told to go in and take care of that. I had talked to  this man, and he was not too dangerous to me. I walked up or went  down to the barrack and all the people in the barracks were outside. I  started in and people out there said,    Don   t go in there. He   s got a  knife.    Well, I had to do it. I got out of that all right, but that was a  scary one. I had two or three little scary things to do.  To stay on active duty, I was at their command. Oh, he was a higher  ranking officer. He assigned me to go into the barrack. The only one in  there was the man, Indian, with a knife. I was scared at that time, but I  walked in and just quietly asked for his knife. He let me have the knife  11  and there wasn   t any trouble about that. My heart was pshh  (Laughs)  Then later on, when they was discharging people, usually I had to take  off one day and go do something that the colonel wanted me to do. I  think those are the serious moments of my life. Well, those were  dangerous things. It was calming down a little bit until I got a letter  from the colonel, because I didn   t need to go and get something done.  Bishop I remember you saying, you were like an Officer of the Day.  Jones Yeah, I forgot and I didn   t answer that letter. I had that letter from the  colonel that was in charge of things. He sent me a letter. That was the  nicest thing that I had ever received because I did it even though I was  scared to death. I guess that was a lot of that done. I was on the rifle  range one day. I think I shot one bullet. I got a good certificate (laughs)  for that.  Bishop Did you ever have to go to any ceremonies?  Jones Did I what?  Bishop Did you ever have to go to any ceremonies? When you were in the  military, did you ever have to attend any ceremonies or award type of  ceremonies?  Jones No. I was so shocked at getting a nice calm letter from this colonel after  he found out that I didn   t answer the first call. That   s about it.  Finchum When you got out of the service, what did you do?  Jones I went back to teaching.  Finchum In Hydro?  Jones I first taught at Hopewell. That   s where I first went to school. There   s a  little story about that. Parents met at the schoolhouse to fill out the  forms. This one little boy was living with his grandmother, and when he  registered in the first grade he went home and they asked him,    How  did you like school?    He said,    I hated it.       What   s the matter? Why?     The boy says,    They won   t let me do this. I can   t read and I can   t write,  and Mr. Jones won   t let me talk.    The parents told me this and we lived  happily. (Laughter)  Finchum Did you retire from school teaching?  Jones Well, I don   t know.  12  Finchum Did you teach your entire working career?  Jones Yes.  Bishop Did you ever teach anywhere else besides Hydro or Hopewell? Did you  ever teach in Altus?  Jones Yeah, Altus. I think that   s where I retired.  Finchum Were you principal?  Jones Was a principal. It worked out real nice for me. I keep getting little  literature from some of the parents and things like that. We got along  pretty good. One day, while I was teaching school, I guess I   d parked  the car and kids came along throwing rocks at one another. They threw  the rocks through the back window, but the father understood. I said,    If  the insurance will take care of it, that   ll be fine.    (Laughs)  Finchum Did you paddle?  Jones Yeah, if I had to, but not very often.  Finchum Boys and girls?  Jones I don   t remember paddling a little girl. I did have to coach football in  elementary. (Laughs) That was a little fun. Some of the parents didn   t  think kids of that age should want to do that. I just had an election. I put  some buckets out there. I had each child go and say what their parents  thought of it. They defeated it. That   s how I did it. I guess I coached  one or two teams, not all of them. I had a rather interesting life, nothing  like a big name.  Finchum Well after you retired, what did you do?  Jones Nothing I guess. (Laughs)  Finchum Travel?  Jones Yes, we did travel a lot. Europe, Alaska, England, oh we did a lot of  touring, my wife and I. I don   t know what happened to my wife. She  was just found dead. I don   t know what the story was, the reasoning, or  anything about it.  Finchum Did your children go to college?  Jones Yes.  13  Finchum Where did they go?  Jones OSU.  Finchum You sent them to OSU?  Jones There was no other school, once they were big. My son, I   d give him a  little spending money. My son somehow, I just don   t know how it  worked out now, but we got it ironed out. Oh, I said I   d take his keys  away from him until I think he was able to obey the law and all that.  That was rough time for him, because he liked to drive the car. One day  he asked me if he could have his car back. I said,    Well if you will obey  the rules,    and I gave him the keys back. I thought that was all there  was to it. He learned a lesson and I learned a lesson. It worked.  Finchum What did he major in at OSU?  Jones I don   t know. He   s in the western part of the state of Oklahoma. I can   t  tell you the town   s name, but he has built him a new house. He never  did get married.  Finchum What was his first name?  Jones Huh?  Finchum What was his name? Sorry.  Jones Do you ever have a block in there?  Finchum I do.  Jones  Gary . He   s retired.  Finchum He graduated from OSU?  Jones Yes.  Finchum Then your daughter  Connie  graduated from OSU too?  Jones Yeah. Her brother wouldn   t let her go to any other school. (Laughs) He  thought OSU had everything. And they both did all right.  Bishop Did you ever think you   d make it to a hundred?  14  Jones No. (Laughs) It was kind of a shock for everybody. I had a lot of  experiences but I never thought they   d carry me this far.  Bishop Anybody in your family ever make it to a hundred?  Jones No.  Bishop What   s your secret to longevity?  Jones I run too fast  Get way out, and know you   re in it. (Laughs) No, I don   t  know. You said, me?  Bishop Yeah, what is your secret to living so long?  Jones I don   t know. I never got arrested for anything. I didn   t drink. Had a  dull life I guess, that   s all. (Laughs)  Finchum Did you smoke?  Jones No. I was a good little boy, but I don   t know why. I just didn   t run with  the crowd.  Bishop How did you celebrate your one hundredth birthday?  Jones I don   t remember if we did really anything. I can   t remember. It wasn   t  very exciting to me.  Bishop What is a typical day like for you today? What time do you get up in the  morning usually?  Jones Are you a lawyer? (Laughs)  Bishop No, no   Finchum How early do you get up?  Jones I   m not sure.  Finchum Five thirty or six thirty?  Jones Probably the latter or a little later. I don   t rush things.  Finchum Then go to bed at midnight?  Jones Depends.  15  Finchum If the Dallas is playing?  Jones I don   t stay out real late.  Bishop What are some of the things you do during the day, today? What are  some of the things that you usually do during the day? Do you read? Do  you watch TV?  Jones I don   t. What do you think I do? Other that this has got to be done  today. I don   t have any  agenda . I might say,    This can wait a day or  two,    so     Bishop I mean, right now, at your age     Jones Yeah.  Bishop    what do you do on a typical day?  Jones Sleep.  Bishop Do you read?  Jones Yes, I did like to read. My eyes are a little bit weak, so I don   t push that  very much.  Bishop Well, going back to your childhood, what were holidays like?  Jones Holidays?  Bishop Uh-huh.  Jones I guess parents, my brothers and sisters, family, would have a birthday  party for us or something. Very mild. Liked to eat good food and stuff,  or we did just a trip or something. It wasn   t all that exciting. We were  pretty much law abiding people, civil people     Finchum But you had a Christmas tree?  Jones Yeah, while we were little.  (Interruption)  Finchum Christmas, would you get presents from your parents? Would you get a  present from your parents at Christmas?  Jones Yeah, I don   t know what. Books, I liked to read   16  Finchum Books.  Bishop What kind of books did you like to read?  Jones Just regular old storybooks, made up of stories. My best friend, Mason  Strong and I, we   d do the same thing. His folks would give him a book,  my parents would give me a book. We   d read them and then we   d swap.  Two for one.  Finchum There you go.  Jones No, I used to check the bookstores and stuff like that. I had nothing else  to do that I wanted to do, just put it that way. Yep. A little farming     Bishop What did you used to do for entertainment?  Jones I guess TV. I watched TV. We didn   t have TV for a long time.  Finchum Remember much from the Depression?  Jones Well, everybody was very much alike. We had the same thing. We  visited the neighbors and they visited us. Nothing really up to date now.  I remember one time, farming, we had a one-row implement and my  dad had a two-row. When I was just a kid, I   d ride that one-row. One  day, I looked down and there was a snake. It wasn   t a poisonous snake.  It was right in front of me. I was a little scared but not too much. I  helped Dad farm, out in the fields. After I got to teaching, I didn   t help  him near as much. I didn   t have the time.  Finchum You plowed with a horse?  Jones Hmm?  Finchum Plowed with a horse?  Jones Mules.  Finchum Mules.  Jones Dad believed in the mule. I never did do much farming. Well, later on I  got enough money to buy a little piece of land and someone else farmed  it, I didn   t.  Bishop Well, is there anything on your bucket list? Something that you still  want to do, but you   ve never done before?  17  Jones We traveled a lot, different places. We went through a big part of  Europe. One place, I believe it was in England, but my wife developed  a disease, I don   t know if it was the flu or not. She wouldn   t have been  able to fly home. I stayed there with her in London. There was a   I  guess one of the laborers at the hospital had a little building that I slept  in while my wife was in the hospital. Then, later they, I don   t remember  who it was, came over and took us back, after she got better. The people  in the hospital wore paper gowns. There was an era in there where  paper gowns were used quite a bit. That was quite different. I stayed on  the campus with her. The group we had, of friends, came back to the  states.  Finchum What was her name? What was your wife   s name?  Jones (Laughs) Zola. Z-O-L-A Rust.  Finchum Zola, hmm. You don   t hear that name too often.  Jones No, there aren   t very many of them left.  Bishop Well I want to know, when history is written, what would you like it to  say about you? How do you want to be remembered?  Jones Oh, just a level headed person. I didn   t get in to much trouble. I didn   t  spend any time in jail or anything like that. (Laughs)  Finchum Pretty good life?  Jones Pretty good life. I didn   t want to go to college. My best friend talked me  into going and being a partner with him. We just rented a room and  went through college that way. That was at Southwestern.  Bishop In your life, how important was church?  Jones Well, we tried to attend somewhere every Sunday. We didn   t always  make it, but we had to have a reason. I thought it was just a rather  normal life.  Finchum Were you Baptist or Catholic or Methodist or     Jones Christian Church.  Finchum Were your parents from Oklahoma?  18  Jones No, they were from Illinois and Arkansas. They moved to Hydro. Then,  from Hydro to the farm. That   s their story.  Finchum Came to Oklahoma to farm?  Jones Who, me?  Finchum Your parents? Your mother and father?  Jones Yes. Some of it was in a covered wagon. When I got, let   s see, I don   t  know whether I was married or not. Anyway, they took me through  Illinois and Arkansas to see where they were from. High class of living.  (Laughs)  Finchum Well, you consider Oklahoma home?  Jones Yes.  Finchum Hydro or Weatherford?  Jones Hydro.  Finchum Hydro.  Jones My grandparents run a place where the farmers when they come to  town to buy something, they had to be by wagon so they had a wagon  yard, they called it. They fed the horses there while they walked up  town and did their shopping. Then they   d go back and pick up the  groceries. By the way, they   d go into the grocery store and tell them  what they wanted and the clerk wrote it down. Then, the farmer walked  to other places and came back later and picked it up. We lived off of  cows and hogs and livestock for food. That was pretty much life at that  time.  Finchum Sold the eggs?  Jones Huh?  Finchum Sold the eggs? Chickens and eggs?  Jones Well, yeah, but we ate quite a lot of them, too. Fried chicken was quite  often on our table. We always wanted something better, but it didn   t  come very fast. (Laughs)  Finchum Make homemade ice cream?  19  Jones Yeah, the neighborhood would have ice cream suppers. The churches  and the school and stuff like that. We liked it. We   d pick up and pile up  brush, and light it on fire and put a weenie or something like that on a  stick and cook it and brought other foods. We   d have crowds. That   s the  way I grew up, the way we entertained. We didn   t have any money, but  we didn   t go hungry either.  Finchum Did Hydro have a movie theatre?  Jones Yeah, we didn   t get to go too often. We were very poor with an old  Model T. I think I was in the third grade when Dad bought an old  Model T car. I always wanted him to get a car. I just walked home from  school one day and saw it out there. I knelt down and I wrapped my arm  around the front wheel, tickled to death. (Laughs)  Finchum Did he let you drive it?  Jones No, I was about third grade when we got it. When two or three farmers  or people would get together, they   d spend the time telling about their  vacations, how many flat tires they had. (Laughs)  Finchum Flat tires were common?  Jones Well yeah, they   d compare to the number with what they had had. You  know, back then, the old rubber tires would have a blow out, and they   d  take them and sew them up or cut off pieces and patch it up. You get  two or three farmers together and they   d be telling about their vacation  and how many flat tires they had. (Laughs) I was just a little kid sitting  around listening to the daddies talk. That was a long time ago. I had a  pony and we rode a pony.  Finchum Did it have a name?  Jones Bill, I think is what we called it, Bill.  Finchum Bill.  Jones A sorrel, he was a small horse. He wasn   t one of these show horses or  plowing horse or anything like that. When they   d take trips, when the  cars got in, you   d hear them tell stories about what happened to their car  on that trip. How many flat tires they had, I was just a little boy. I   d just  set there when a group of people would get together and listen to them  talk.  Finchum The good old days.  20  Jones Well, if we didn   t know any better and had something to eat, we were  good. We raised most of it. Eggs, milk and cream, for sale. Then the  farmers would bring it to town and put it to be analyzed for how much  money they were going to get. We   d get the money, and we   d go order  our groceries. They   d pile it in a pile right in the center of the floor.  They got their money from the creameries and they   d go back. That was  their shopping. Everybody was doing it, so that was the good old days.  Finchum Well, thank you for talking with us.  Jones I kind of enjoy going back.  Finchum It was a pleasure.  Jones Some of it   s real and some of it   s faded away.  -------  -------
