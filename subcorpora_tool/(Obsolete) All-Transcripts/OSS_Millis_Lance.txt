 Gill. I   m interviewing Lance Millis. Today is August  27, 2008. We   re in the Edmon Low Library on the Oklahoma State  University campus. I   m a faculty member of Oklahoma State University  Library. This interview is being conducted as part of the O-STATE  stories project of the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Lance  Millis was a Pistol Pete mascot at Oklahoma State University. Before we  get into that though, I want to ask you, when did you first see Pistol  Pete, the mascot? And what was your impression, do you remember?  For me it was probably in high school. And that was really before I was  connected with OSU in terms of wanting to go to school here or going to  school here. I thought he was real neat and a neat representation of a  university. But at that point I wasn   t connected to OSU so it didn   t mean  all that much to me as it did later.  Lance, maybe sort of back up a little too. Just give us a little bit of  background. Where you grew up and a little bit about yourself and kind  of how you got to Oklahoma State.  Okay, I   m from Bartlesville, Bartlesville High School. I spent about five  years of my elementary time, elementary school in London, and then  back to Bartlesville. So I grew up seventh grade on in Bartlesville. Then  came to OSU in 1984. What else?  Just growing up by itself.  I   ve got one brother who   s an OSU graduate, also.  Older or younger?  Older brother, a year and a half older than me. My folks are from  Alabama and Tennessee but mom   s an OSU graduate from 1992. So I  5  Gill  Millis  Gill  Millis  Gill  Millis  Gill  Millis  actually got to present her and congratulate her when she got a  scholarship to transfer to OSU.  So in    92?     92 right. 1992, not 1892 as I would probably joke with her about. My  degree from OSU is in recreation administration and management. I also  have a master   s degree in interdisciplinary sciences and work for OSU  since 1989.  I   m going to kind of guess a little bit. My question is going to be what  factors influenced you to come to Oklahoma State. I guess you had your  older brother that influenced you among other things.  My older brother was very talented academically. He visited campuses  all over the country. I tagged along on some of those visits but only  because I had to, not because I wanted to. Basically he made the  decision to come to OSU because it was a good school. It   s an  engineering school, his degree is in engineering. I think I sort of just by  default decided,    Well he   s smart, he came to OSU, it must be a good  school. I   ll go to school there too.    It worked out really well for me, but  I did not make a really informed or intelligent decision in terms of the  process I went through back then. I couldn   t have possibly come up with  a better university to attend and the relationship I   ve had with OSU. I  can   t imagine it being similar at any other school.  Lance, apart from your Pistol Pete, your mascot experience, can you tell  us a little bit about your OSU experience? Some things you participated  in? Some things you did?  Yup, I was in a fraternity, Delta Tau Delta fraternity. It actually  happened that my freshman year,  1984-1985  one of the guys in the  house, one of the seniors was Pistol Pete. And so from just about the  very first day I got here     Was it Scott Petty?  It was Rick Wilson, the year before Scott Petty. So, Rick was Pete. From  day one on OSU   s campus, I went to the Delt house and there   s a guy  loading up the Pistol Pete head getting ready to go to an event with the  pom-pom girls and so that caught my attention. (Laughter) And so I paid  attention and watched what he did. As I got older the next year, Scott  Petty, also in the fraternity, coincidentally, he was Pistol Pete the next  year. And so throughout my whole college career, I was around Pistol  Petes.  6  Gill  Millis  Gill  Millis  I started thinking about it,    Hey that sounds like something that would  be kind of cool, I could do that.    I kind of like acting crazy. I love OSU,  sports are terrific and representing the University in general. I knew the  guys and I knew what they did outside of the athletic events. The kinds  of speaking engagements they went to, and working with alumni and  those kinds of things. And sort of started to see what they did and kind  of putting myself in those shoes and figuring out if it was something I  thought I could do. Then I decided it was. I started working with Scott.  And Scott helped me an awful lot to know the things to do and not to do  in the interview and what to expect.  Can you tell us a little bit about your interview process? And what you  had to go through? The selection?  At that time, and I   m not sure how much of this is still included in the  interviews. But at that time we had to, of course you had to try on the  head and walk around and see if you knew what you were doing, if you  walked like a cowboy. But most of it was interview   questions about  your background and how you feel about OSU and how you feel about  Pistol Pete what you know about Pistol Pete and history of Frank Eaton  and also the mascot and so that was some of it. But then also questions  like   if you attended an alumni banquet and you were just sitting there  in the crowd because somebody took you and the speaker recognized  that you were Pistol Pete and announced to the group that you were  Pistol Pete and would you come up to the stage and say a few words,  what would you say? Luckily someone told me that question ahead of  time, so I had at least apparently a reasonable answer since I was  selected.  We had to do a pantomime because as Pistol Pete of course, you can   t  talk. So not only did you have to effectively pantomime when you were  in the head, but just to see how you were creative and what kinds of  things you could do. It happened that one of the people, Rick Wilson  actually was one of the judges. And I forget that if he told me about it or  Scott told me about it, but somebody had told me the pantomime he had  done when he tried out. And so I did that. About half way through my  pantomime he started laughing because he realized that I was doing his  pantomime. But of course he couldn   t hold it against me because it  worked for me.  What years did you serve as Pete?  I was Pistol Pete in 1987-88, the one academic year. I had tried out the  year previous, and at the time we had what was called Pete   s Partners  and that was just sort of some of the guys who had tried out for Pistol  Pete that year but weren   t selected but we pulled the drum on the field.  7  Gill  Millis  Gill  Millis  Gill  Millis  Gill  And a lot of times Pistol Pete would ride on the drum. We were sort of  helpers for him at the football games; you know run crowd control and  try to remove unruly cameramen when they were in Pistol Pete   s way  and things like that. But that was a lot of fun. Of course I was around  Pistol Pete a lot more that way, and that really helped me too the next  year when I tried out for the second time so I was selected.  Was there two Pete   s at that time? At one time there was one and an  alternate and then there were two Pete   s. What was the situation your  year?  The year before me, Scott Petty   s second year was the first year that  there were two Pistol Petes. And so my year was two Pistol Petes, also.  You talked about some of the antics of Pistol Pete. What were some do   s  and don   ts that you had and some expectations that they give you?  Yes. Sometimes you didn   t find out the don   ts until you had done them.  And I found out a don   t is don   t drive a remote controlled vehicle with  OSU flags on it around the other team huddled at basketball games  while they   re in a time out. Don   t do that. The main don   t, you weren   t  required to keep it a secret that you were Pistol Pete, but basically you  didn   t want anybody during an athletic event or when you were  performing to see you outside of the head. And so when we were, of  course you   ve got to take the head off and take a break and things like  that or occasionally you   ve got to talk to people. So we always had to go  find a secluded area outside of the stadium or someplace where we  couldn   t be seen by the crowd to take the head off. Do   s were kind of  just go to as many athletic events as you could obviously. The biggest  one you had to be at, had to didn   t really matter we went to everything I  possibly could. There wasn   t, honestly it was   you knew you were in  trouble if you had done a don   t but you didn   t know what the don   ts  were ahead of time.  And as you said earlier you couldn   t speak     Right, that   s exactly. You couldn   t speak. And you had to be careful  with the guns obviously for obvious reasons. Some people don   t know  that Pistol Pete can   t speak. Opposing crowds and things like that and  they   ll try to talk to you and then they   ll get frustrated cause you can   t  talk and ask you questions and it   s hard to pantomime an answer to. So  that was a challenge, but lot of fun.  You said that one of the do   s is to go to as many things as you could. So  let me kind of divide this. There   s athletic events that you are required to  go to, expected to go to     8  Millis  Gill  Millis  Gill  Millis  Gill  Millis  Right.  And then there   s other personal appearances that you make. Could you  sort of want to explain that to us? And then maybe how many total  events would you make say in a year   s time in your year as Pete?  I think there were probably about 400-500 events between the two of us.  So roughly 200-250 that we had each done after the year was over. I say  as many events as you could. At that time, like baseball games weren   t  required and softball games and those kinds of things. And so those  we   d tried going to as many as we possibly could given our schedule and  of course they play during the day and classes and those sorts of things.  But just about any University activity that they wanted Pistol Pete at     we   d go to everything from a sit down dinner that the hotel restaurant  management group had. I don   t even know how many Posse Club or  alumni different kinds of events and things like that.  Then there were kind of events that just sort of fell in your lap.  Somebody   s friend   s kid was having a birthday and they wanted Pistol  Pete to come to the party and so we   d do some of those. I did a church  service one time as Pistol Pete for the Salvation Army and that was kind  of unique. And did bell ringing with the Salvation Army for  Thanksgiving. There were some business openings and things like  that   alumni. Did a wedding. A lot of times it would just be alumni that  wanted to have Pistol Pete at and they would pay your expenses to come  down to drive to wherever they live or whatever so you could go to that  event. We   d have some of those.  You made about 200-250 a year.  Right.  So did you get   it   s kind of a two part question. First off, did you get  scholarships for being Pistol Pete?  At that time, and I don   t think they called it a scholarship. There was a  check that we got that was about  150 I believe each semester. That was,  I think, to pay for books, that kind of a thing. And then when you  traveled all the expenses were paid for. At that time, I know at some  point previous to when I was Pistol Pete, Pistol Pete wasn   t really  sponsored by the athletic department. So there was less financial support  so the guys would have to pay for things on their own. But we were  supported our travel was paid for we went with the Spirit Group there  was plenty of money to pay for food and those kinds of things. Plus we  went to summer camp the year   the summer before that and t-shirts and  shorts and all kinds of sportswear and equipment like that.  9  Gill  Millis  Gill  Millis  Gill  Millis  Gill  Speaking about your outfit, did they provide the outfit now?  Absolutely.  And could you describe a little bit?  Right, and it used to be Tener   s. Tener   s used to be the sponsor and just  you know, a couple of weeks after you were selected as Pistol Pete there  would be a date set up and you would go down to Oklahoma City and  meet with them at Tener   s and they   d size you for boots and give you a  free pair of boots and three or four pairs of jeans and couple of belts and  buckle and some western shirts and they were, somebody had those  engraved   not engraved   embroidered. Put Pistol Pete on those. I think  we had, you know, ball caps. Obviously we didn   t wear those as the  mascot. The rest   the chaps, the holster and gun and the vest, and of  course the head, those were sort of passed down from Pete to Pete. I  think every once in a while they sort of get old enough that somebody  end up keeping theirs and the University bought some new ones. And in  fact I think I have the vest from when I was Pistol Pete sitting in my  closet at the house.  Cool. (Laughs)Well Lance, was the Pistol Pete experience, you know,  what you thought it would be before and looking at it afterwards?  Absolutely. I think sort of shallowly at the time it was, I can represent  the University that   d be great and it looks like it   d be a lot of fun. And of  course it was all those things. The most meaningful part of it is all the  people I met during that time and the connection I made with OSU as an  institution and it sort of strengthened my emotional attachment to the  University anyway. But that   s kind of the most meaningful is the  connections with the people and the institution as a whole   that  developed from that. A lot of fun. A lot of meaningful stuff.  We may get to it in a minute some of the experiences I had with kids and  some of the fun more memorable things that are very much etched in my  memory. Also, I found out since when people introduce me in situations  that have nothing to do with OSU or with the mascot or that I   m not  expecting it, people value so highly that I was Pistol Pete that I get  introduced as a former Pistol Pete all the time. It   s just kind of comical  to me because it was just so long ago. I always wonder do these people  who are being told this really care, but the people that introduce me  always do, so they still introduce to me that way.  Speaking kind of emotions can you recall the first time that you were at  an athletic event as Pete and your emotions and feelings?  10  Millis  Gill  Millis  Gill  Millis  Gill  Millis  Gill  Millis  Yes, it was a baseball game. It was probably within a week after I   d  been selected as Pistol Pete, because they do selections in April so I  think we were in the Big XII  sic Big Eight  race. And it was   if I  remember correctly it was a   I don   t remember who we were playing,  but it was a nationally televised baseball game back then, so back in the     80s when a televised baseball game was a pretty big deal. And of  course Robin Ventura   it was in the middle of Robin Ventura   s     Streak.     hitting streak. So I knew there was a lot of attention to that. The  emotions I was feeling   was scared to death. At the baseball field, it   s  not real easy to do Pistol Pete because there   s just not a lot of room.  And basically you just walk up one side and walk down the middle aisle  and interact with as many people as you can and lead cheers and those  kinds of things. But the aisle   s not very wide so you   re running into  people and there   s not much you can do and you   re kind of worried  about the gun. I hadn   t done anything previously at all so I didn   t know  if I was doing it right or not and I know everybody   s looking at me and  I   m figuring I   m stepping on people   s toes. And I   m hoping the cameras  on me but I   m also hoping the cameras not on me. So the emotions I  remember was excited but scared to death that I was going to do  something dumb and it was going to be on TV.  (Laughs) Okay.  Little did I know that later on I would be hoping to do things that were  dumb that would be on TV.  Did you, talking about baseball game, did you have a favorite sport that  you enjoyed being Pete at?  Wrestling.  Wrestling.  That was John Smith   s   that was the end of the    86-   87 school year was  when I did the baseball. And then I was Pistol Pete    87-   88 which was  John Smith   s senior year and it happens that I had, just that year in  general, I had Thurmon Thomas his senior year, Barry Sanders     sophomore year, John Smith was on the wrestling team, you know  lighting the world on fire. John Starks was on the basketball team. Liz  Brown was on the women   s basketball team. Robin Ventura was on the  baseball team. Kenny Monday was around too. Scott Verplank was on  the golf team. So it was just a huge year in OSU sports history and I just  lucked into being around that year. But wrestling was my favorite. And  11  Gill  Millis  Gill  Millis  Gill  Millis  the most memorable thing about that   besides getting to watch John  wrestle all the time   was how mad the crowd got at me because I was  into the match as much as they were and in order to see the match I was  always blocking somebody   s view. And so I was always having to move  around so I was out of everybody   s way and they wouldn   t get too mad  at me but I still got to watch John   s wrestling matches. Yeah, wrestling  was the greatest. It still is obviously.  Lance, in additional to people saying you were a former Pete, they all  tell me say Lance Millis knows more about Frank Eaton, Frank    Pistol  Pete    Eaton than anyone else. What do you remember most about the  characteristics of Frank Eaton?  The fact that he was a cowboy through and through. And he was really  kind of a throw back. He was a cowboy when there really weren   t  cowboys around anymore. You know, 1950s he   s still wearing his gun  and holster and his gun is loaded and he   s you know, pulling his gun and  shooting off rounds when he gets excited about something. And he  dressed the part. He   s, you know totally   obviously, just for the record,  I was not around in the    50s. But you know in all the research I did and  all the people I talked to, he was just a cowboy and you could tell he was  a cowboy and he looked like he could fit in the old west. And you know  people driving around cars, and not   still cowboys around Oklahoma,  but not the way Frank did it.  To me, once I started studying the history of Frank Eaton and the timing  and things like that. He was born in 1860 and so that   s a long time ago.  That   s cowboys in the wild west. But he lived until 1957-1958 and     wait a minute that   s just a few years before I was born. So to me that just  brought history so much closer to me personally. And obviously kicking  around the same areas that he did and talking to people who saw him do  this and saw him do that. Not only did it obviously bring me closer and  more knowledgeable about him and his legend and his history but also  just generally to history and the history of the wild west and that it   s not  so far removed from the present day.  Isn   t it interesting that he died in    58?    58 is the first year we had the  Pistol Pete mascot.  Absolutely. That   s right.  Interesting. You talked about some of the characteristics of Pete, were  there some of those you tried to emulate? That you tried to display when  you were out on the field being Pistol Pete?  Mostly it was physical traits I tried to emulate and of course the  12  Gill  Millis  Gill  Millis  cowboy   s bowlegged. So I tried to emulate that. I think a lot more of  what I did was kind of caricature of a cowboy and trying to make sure I  looked like a cowboy in my movements and my mannerisms and the  actions I did so I didn   t just look like some kid with a cowboy hat on and  boots doing    rah-rah    at a football game. So I tried to do western kinds  of things and cowboy kinds of activities instead of you know    rah-rah.     You know it   s not easy to do that and of course now my example earlier  of driving a remote control vehicle around the other team huddle at half  time wasn   t very cowboy like.  And you kind of had that swagger?  Absolutely and too you know it   s   everybody says well how do you get  the bowlegged thing if you   re not bowlegged to begin with? Well if you  put cowboy boots on and all the gear and you put 45 pound head on your  shoulders, apparently you just walk bowlegged then anyway. (Laughter)  Doesn   t matter if you intend to or not. That   s just how it works.  That   s great. Lance, you had a chance to observe a lot of mascots when  you were here. Did it make a difference for you knowing that Pistol Pete  was a character of a real life person opposed to Herbie Husker or  someone like that or something?  Well incidentally, all of us think we were the best one ever and I   m right  about that. Everybody else isn   t but everybody   all the Petes think  they   re the best one ever. Most of the research that I did on Frank Eaton  was after I was Pistol Pete and after I was out of school. And so usually  it was through working with guys that were trying out after me in the  few years that I judged. I would work with them on knowing the history  not only so they could tell the story because people would always ask  them the story. So they would know the character and they would know  the history of the man they were portraying.  It   s not just a mascot that OSU chose because they picked a picture out  of a book and that   s cool and we   re the   you know the Horned Frogs.  It   s something that has to do with the history of this part of the country.  A real life man was the model for it. And his family still lives. It means  a lot more than just the mascot for other universities. It   s connected to  the truth and the true history of this part of the country. So those are the  kinds of things I tried to impress on the guys so that they would just  understand it a little bit better. And sort of try to portray that and  however their personality fit with Pistol Pete but also kind of portray  that in their actions as being Pete. Of course I knew the story. Every  time you try out you   ve got to go back over the book real quick make  sure you know all the facts in case somebody in the interview asks you  some obscure fact. And that got worse once I started doing my research  13  Gill  Millis  Gill  Millis  Gill  Millis  Gill  Millis  and I was doing try outs because I would of course always ask them  some obscure fact to see if they knew it.  Did you have some memorable moments that stood out more than others  in your year as Pete?  I   d say the most meaningful was probably when a young man, it was  during baseball season. It was actually the end of when I was Pistol Pete  the following year    87-   88   the    88 baseball season. And It was a young  man from Tulsa who had leukemia and apparently he   d gone on a Make-  A-Wish trip. He   d just gotten back from meeting the president. And  somebody with the organization was talking to him about that trip. He  was thanking them and telling them how wonderful it was. And  apparently at the end of it he said,    That was really cool to meet the  president, but who I really want to meet is Pistol Pete.    And so he came  over and they got him tickets to the game and I got to go down on the  field and play catch with him and kind of go with him and help him get  some autographs from some of the baseball players. He wrote me a  really neat thank you note that I   ve still got today, thanking me for  meeting with him. And you   re my best friend Pistol Pete, I love you, that  kind of thing. Of course he had leukemia and I never did hear what  happened to him. But that was pretty meaningful.  OSU went to the Sun Bowl, the football team, that year. That was  actually Coach Gundy   s junior year, wasn   t coach then obviously. He  was the quarterback. We went to the Sun Bowl. It was 70 degrees the  day before the Sun Bowl and it snowed at the game. And in fact during  that game from halftime, I borrowed somebody   s cell phone, and back  then hardly anybody had cell phones, and proposed to my wife by cell  phone at the time.  At half time at the football game?  Yup.  Great story.  Yup.  So Linda said yes, obviously.  Yeah. Of course I had an idea that she might say yes to begin with.   Millis has since been reminded that he had technically already  proposed, and the call from halftime actually discussed the matter and  verified the engagement to others present.   14  Gill  Millis  Gill  Millis  Gill  Millis  That   s great. Well you talked about a young child. Did you enjoy  working with children? You always notice that where Pete goes there   s a  flock of kids around him.  Oh, the kids were awesome. It was just   it was like the Pied Piper. Just  a magnet for the kids. They were chasing you. Honestly, what my mind  was focused on with the kids was don   t step on one of them because you  can   t see anything. Really, all you can see is two circles out here and a  circle down here so you can kind of see down. At baseball games was  particularly bad because they   d follow you. You   d be walking doing  Pete   and get behind you, of course you had no idea. So if somebody  yelled at you, you need to stop and turn around, or you wanted to go  back the other direction. If you weren   t careful you would stop and turn  around and run over somebody. Then there   s Pistol Pete just made a kid  cry. And that   s not a good thing. But yeah, they were   oh, I couldn   t  count how many photographs I posed for with kids and birthday parties  and all kinds of events. They were just   even kids that didn   t like OSU.  Kids with big OU hats and shirts on would run up. They   d give me a  hard time, but they   d run up and they   d want to see Pistol Pete.  Did you feel a special sense of responsibility representing the University  and our mascot?  Absolutely, and that   s one of those things they really impressed upon us.  It   s not just you. It   s not just the Spirit Group. It   s the athletic team, it   s  the athletic program, it   s the University and it   s all the alumni that came  before you that you   re representing. And you   re also representing the  Pistol Pete alumni   the former Petes   in everything that you do. So  even when you   re not wearing the head necessary if you   re on a trip with  the University you   re an ambassador for the University you need to act a  certain way and treat people a certain way. That was very much  impressed upon us, how important that was.  At the time what did it mean to you being Pistol Pete?  That   s a tough question at the time, what did it mean? I   d say it was a lot  of fun. I think you say the things in the tryouts that,    Yeah it   d be great  to represent the University.    But then when you   re doing it and there are  literally 50,000-60,000 people cheering and screaming. Or reacting to  something that you did. You can tell you did something that a good  portion of the crowd is paying attention to and sees or you   re leading a  cheer or you   ve shot the gun or something like that. You sort of get the  idea of the scale of the impact you can have and you sort of realize,     Okay I   d better be careful with this because this is a lot of  responsibility. I need to make sure this is all positive and promoting  OSU and not you know, against the other team,    that kind of thing. And  15  Gill  Millis  Gill  Millis  Gill  Millis  too after I got to know the Eaton family a little bit more, then I was  representing that man and that family too in everything that I did. It was  a lot of responsibility. But extremely rewarding. A lot of fun.  So now, looking back, what does it mean to you now?  It   s kind of an attachment that   well first of all its something that very  few other people have or have experienced or done. There   s 50-60 of us  something like that. Maybe a few more than that. But in the whole  history of OSU there   s only a few of us, only two of us at a time that get  to represent OSU in that way. And then you hear things like,    OSU   s  mascot was voted on ESPN as one of the best mascots in the country,     or something like that. That again reminds you of the kind of scale that  it   s not just OSU people paying attention seeing you. It   s nationwide  sometimes when you   re on television as a mascot doing things. It   s  meaningful, representing the Eaton   s. And Mr. Eaton, Frank Eaton, and  it   s also sort of the basis for my connection with the University that  absolutely being Pistol Pete might have happened but it would   ve just  been totally different than the amount of love I have for the University  and how much I care about it and why and how deep that was.  Is there a special bond between the former Petes? Do you stay in touch?  Yeah. It could be said that most of the Petes are half way crazy and  some of them are more than halfway crazy. And it   s something to stand  out among the Pistol Petes. It seems like every time we get together it   s  kind of a contest to see who can tell the craziest story or do the craziest  thing. One of the Homecoming Parades, you know, you   re supposed to  throw candy to the kids. Somebody brought donuts and we were  throwing donuts at the kids. I mean so just crazy stuff. But yeah the  Petes   there   s a bond absolutely. It   s like a fraternity.  Well, you probably don   t think about this Lance, but you left a legacy as  Pistol Pete. What do you thinks your legacy? How do you want to be  remembered as Pistol Pete?  You know I   d like to think I was the best Pistol Pete. I probably wasn   t  there might be somebody else who was better. I don   t know who it is,  but I   d like to think I was the best one. But probably more significant  beyond that is the research I did because of my involvement with Pistol  Pete. The research and then the   that culminated in winning the award  for   Frank Eaton won the Director   s Award from the National Cowboy  Hall of Fame. And the research I did there just really connected me with  him and with history and with Oklahoma history and again worked out  with the University and the people I met through that process. So I  probably want to be remembered as the Pistol Pete that really tried to  16  Gill  Millis  Gill  Millis  Gill  Millis  Gill  Millis  share and pass on and get recognition for Frank Eaton and what he  meant.  You told me a little bit about it, maybe a little bit more detail. Looking  back you mentioned that you are often introduced as a former Pistol  Pete     Usually they say I   m an old Pistol Pete, which I prefer former.  How does that influence your life today? Looking back, how is it still  influencing having been a former Pete?  Well it   s a huge deal to my kids. They   re four and seven right now, but  they   every time they see Pistol Pete,    Daddy, that   s you  Daddy, that   s  you        Well no, really it   s somebody else, but I used to do that.    We   d  go to OSU event and,    Oh this is my daddy, he   s Pistol Pete.    It   s a huge  deal to them. I don   t know. It   s very meaningful. Very strong connection  with the University. I don   t know why, but I guess it   s so often that it   s  kind of comical to me that I get introduced and what a big deal it is.  And I guess I understand. If somebody else that I worked with was  Pistol Pete I   d probably introduce them that way too. But I   d kind of just  to   you know kind of be in the background and not everybody,    Oh  look at me, I was Pistol Pete     What are the lessons that you learned from being Pete that you applied  later in your life?  Gosh Jerry, these are good questions. I   m not prepared for these kinds of  good questions. About being a representative of something that   s bigger  than you. That everything you do can either influence positively or  potentially negatively people   s perceptions of that institution and their  views too.  What would you tell an OSU student now that   s thinking about trying  out for Pete?  Do it  And I do. I actually, most years I end up talking to one or two  guys that are trying out. I   m not sure how they find out, but I   ll talk to  them. Yeah I just kind of explain the connection to the university that  you   re going to have. That   s probably meaningless to them and the fun  that they can have. But that   s it   s really important that it is and they   re  not only representing themselves and the university, they   re representing  those of us that did this previously and that it means a lot to us.  I try to impress upon them the history of Frank Eaton and what he did,  what he stood for and the legend and history, those kinds of things. And  17  Gill  Millis  Gill  Millis  then I try to do like, what happened to me with Rick Wilson. I try to tell  them as many things as I can that might come up in the interview that  could help them get selected. In fact one of the guys this year, I spoke to  him the two years previous, he tried out twice. Rhys Gay was picked this  year and I visited with him a couple of years ago.  So asked the question what would you tell young men who tried out and  you said that you   d say yes. Would you do it again?  Absolutely. And you know I would try to do more than I did. I probably  didn   t realize until after I was through the impact that it can have on kids  who you went to their birthday party. I remember guys trying out that  still had a birthday card that Pistol Pete gave them when they were like  six. So this is a 18 year old that   s kept a birthday card from Pistol Pete  from twelve years ago, and it was that meaningful to them.  Lance is there anything, any additional things you   d like to say about  your experience as Pete that maybe we missed? Or things that would be  important for someone to want to know about?  One little story that will probably come up with somebody else, I don   t  know this is sort of a more recent history. Just a little anecdote, sad.  Charlie Lester was the first student to portray Pistol Pete wearing the  get-up and the head. He passed away, I forgot how long ago it was but  he lived in Perry and a number of us   he was sort of the father of all of  us. He   s kind of the elder statesmen of the Pistol Petes. But he passed  away and I was going to his funeral.  The day before it happened I   for some reason got this idea that  wouldn   t it be cool if we could have Pistol Pete there. So I called his  family to ask if that would be okay. They said it would be fine. And  what I planned was for Pistol Pete to stand actually at the burial in the  cemetery like over   way away from the whole ceremony. And just  stand there, just kind of quietly watching, just sort of overseeing Charlie  being laid to rest. And they   oh they thought that was going to be great.  I arranged for that to happen. Apparently when it came to doing it, the  family wanted Pistol Pete right there, up in the ceremony. So this guy  who   d just been selected as Pistol Pete I think this was his first event to  go to as Pistol Pete.  Rob Neville  It   s a funeral and he was      Well,  okay, I   ll just stand there, that   ll be all right.    He gets pulled into, not the  ceremony in the church but he   s under the awning he   s   literally, his  toes are over the edge of the grave. He   s right at the end of the casket  and he   s in the receiving line. But the family   s absolutely thrilled to this  day with what happened and that   s meaningful to them, but it wasn   t  exactly what we planned. But it was a meaningful deal for Charlie  Lester.  18  Gill  Millis  Gill  Millis  Gill  Millis  Gill  Millis  Lance, one final question I wanted to ask you. Tell us a little bit about     because you represented Oklahoma State University as Pete and told me  what an honor, and how special that was. Could you tell us a little bit  about your career and how you   ve represented Oklahoma State  University since?  I graduated in    88, December of    88, officially. Lived in Red River, New  Mexico and was getting ready to change jobs. And spoke to, I think I  came back for a visit, for a wedding   in fact I believe it was Scott  Petty   s wedding. Anyway I was talking to him and it happened that he  worked at OSU in high school and college relations and just mentioned  to him that I was looking for a job and just looking to get back to  civilization and he said,    Well, hey we   ve got a job opening in our office  coming up. You ought to apply for that    Anyway I applied, and they  selected me so I became a university representative at the Office of High  School and College Relations, which is now called the Admissions  Office. But worked there for I believe seven years from    89 to    96  recruiting high school students and junior college students to the  University.  Actually, through doing that, learned about all the other people that had  previously done that job and had gone on to work in different areas in  the University. During the course of that time I sort of figured out that I  liked doing what I was doing and recruiting the students, but I didn   t  want to be on the road doing it forever. So I kind of focused my  attention on academic advising. It took a few years, because at the time I  didn   t have a master   s degree but secured a position as an academic  advisor in the College of Education. Worked on and obtained my  master   s degree while I was doing that and now I   m a Senior Counselor  and Assistant Director for Student Services for the College of Education  where I still work now.  So you   ve represented Oklahoma State University for how many years  now?  Well, since 1989, so almost 18-19 years.  Wow that   s a lot     Still don   t feel old enough to have been doing anything for that length of  time. But yeah.  Thanks, I appreciate it Lance very much.  No problem.  19  Gill  Millis  Gill  And appreciate your service for the University as well.  Thanks.  That concludes the interview, appreciate so much, Lance  -------  -------
